0,SnoopyStyle,two in one,7,16 January 2021,"It's March 2020 and London is under covid lockdown. Paxton (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Linda (Anne Hathaway) have broken up but are still forced to live in the same house. He is an underemployed van driver after a fight and prison record have left him with little opportunity. She works for a high-end jewelry company and forced to fire her subordinates. A coincidence has them both evacuating a $3 million diamond from the temporarily closed Harrods.Director Doug Liman is doing a covid movie with a heist squeezed into the last act. It's basically two movies and the two hour running time very much indicates that. There is the overall relationship story and I find that interesting in a covid way. It tries to do some comedic touches which works to a certain level but can't actually be laugh out loud funny. It is little bits of quirkiness in all the Zoom calls. I also wonder if it's too soon or too close to home. The second story is the heist story and I'm more conflicted. It's a pedestrian heist more notable for getting a tour of Harrods. There is a way to make the heist more dangerous but that would involve more work. I don't think the short production schedule would allow for that. This is more seat-of-the-pants production. All in all, I like the two performances and the relationship stuff.",Locked Down

2,deloudelouvain,Boring like the whole society we're living in now.,5,27 February 2021,"I was wondering how long it would take them before they came up with a Covid movie and apparently it's not even that long as we're still right in the middle of it. The movie is as boring as the whole supposed pandemia. I guess they made it in the beginning of the outbreak as the measures still seem to be mild, not really what we are imposed to do now. Locked Down is too long, much too long. It's a lot of talking, a lot of uninteresting conversations.. And even though the cast contains some well known actors it's still a mediocre movie. You have to wait till the very last part to have some crime, but even that wasn't satisfying. If you want to watch endless conversations between Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway then this is a movie for you. If on the other hand you're sick of hearing anything about Covid just skip this one, I wish I did.",Locked Down
3,Cineanalyst,At Least You May Watch It in Pajamas,4,17 January 2021,"Well, that wasn't worth violating quarantine or safety guidelines. These characters should shelter in place, as they tend to be inconsistent with the wearing of masks and keeping away from close proximity to others. It's bad enough that much of ""Locked Down"" is spent on lousy Zoom footage with celebrity cameos, and Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor incessantly bickering over their romantic foibles--even if Hathaway is rocking the top professional dress and bottom pajamas look. As promising as the idea of covering this past year or so of living during a pandemic is, this movie only plays the common notes: of strained interpersonal relations within shared living quarters during lockdown; job furloughs; Zoom mishaps; increased use of cigarettes, booze and other drugs; complicated grocery shopping; loons yelling poetry and running red lights in the streets; and the reported bread-making fad. I don't care how many more months I spend imprisoned in my home, the closest I'm coming to baking bread is putting slices in a toaster.All of which distracts from a decent premise for a heist flick. One just needs to shake their head that although they have the perfect excuse to cover their faces in front of security cameras during the theft that they nonetheless frequently pull their face coverings down. But, yeah, it's a somewhat fun con exploiting the ""lockdown,"" which takes on a double meaning here. Even their rationalizing of the heist is acceptable as just that rather than anything actually profound in regards to their fictional world or the real one that they parody.",Locked Down
4,cruise01,Locked down does make you feel trapped for weeks with this film.,6,18 January 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Locked Down is a fair romantic drama heist film. About a plot of a couple Paxton (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Linda (Anne Hathaway) who are quarantined in a house for weeks cause of covid. While there relationship is fallen apart. Both of there jobs are bringing them down. They both decide to commit a heist to steal an expensive diamond that for a company that they both work for.Plot is decent. The first hour of the movie is boring and slow. The characters being quarantined really does make you feel stuck in the house for weeks. It picks up when they both plot a heist which is somewhat entertaining.Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor are both decent with there roles. There are a lot of cameo of other actors that show up on zoom with the main cast like Mindy Kaling. Ben Stiller. Ben Kingsley. And others that have a brief role. Which was fun.Locked Down does locked the audience in for a slow boredom first hour. But has some entertainment value. And decent cast to make it worth watching.,Locked Down

She and Ejiofor seem to be trying to out-overact each other in every scene. Not that the script is any help; it's an obnoxious, self-insistent Sorkin-wannabe, full of long, ridiculous, self-absorbed monologues, with the characters speaking out the subtext in faux-clever analogies. Any humor that works gets lost in a sea of pretentious pomposity and yuppie whining.",Locked Down

SUMMARYRevolutionary artistic pieces like Locked Down have a lot of good qualities about them as they try to get us to think and look at the world past glitz and glamor. Locked Down is no exception as the realistic piece addresses the relevant issues of human life during COVID quarantine and the impacts it has on a lot of things in real life. Decent acting by Hathaway and Ejiofor are a central pillar to enjoying this movie, capturing an atmosphere that is part entertainment and part real life drama that makes for a nice hybrid characters. While not superheroes, or delivering amazing original speeches, the two characters sort of have that middle class to lower upper class vibe who struggle with different aspects of life to challenge them. These realistic portrayals, albeit a bit overdramatic at times, craft characters that many should latch onto particularly if you find their issues relevant.
Past the actors, the movie does a nice job of showing multiple facets of life during these times, with camera work adapting to give you the most of each scenario. Bleak trips to the grocery star and seeing people horde essentials, Zoom meetings and the various dynamics involved presenting yourself at home, to even depression from the isolation at home and tension in relationships. These various aspects of life, alongside the relevant issues of moral integrity, offer those who like movies that make you reevaluate life will enjoy the presentation this film has as our two leads address the things that plague them. It's relevant, it's deep, and thus fans who love this artistic display of life are going to be fully immersed to see how they work things out. But for entertainment purposes there are some light icings on the cake that might help you weather through the realism. Dry humor that has some good timing await those with an ear for the art of British comedy. No fancy set ups or falling down stairs, Locked Down is all about letting the characters just engage with each other and let their quirks be the comedy power they may have. Ben Kingsley character was probably the funniest for me, but the numerous cameos are going to offer some potential outlets to make you laugh. Late in the game comes a twist to inject some movie magic into the plot and add a little more purpose to all the buildup in hopes that you get a little more adventure... more on that later. Finally, the last thing that some might like is the fashion element that they wear, not much in terms of movies, but fashion shows exist due to fan base, so I give props to nice outfits.For those looking for more a usual entertaining piece though, this film is going to be limited given the approach they took. Realistic as it is, the plot for much of the movie is aimless, a dance of life that may be what some feel in these times, but really is not fun. Our two characters sort of just exist and interact with a few extras before going back to just facing each other and working out their ordeals. This sort of wondering plot grasping for straws tries to do some build up, but even this thin and mediocre, that just leads to a dragged out experience of life that is very slow in the grand scheme of things. Even the twist itself is underwhelming, something that feels like the set-up of a crime show, but then drops it for more character development and real life perspective with a little dry humor forced in to the mix. The entertainment factor dropped for me because of all these disappointing attempts at story, but again appreciate the look at life and informative piece that early COVID day life throws in. The random dives at other aspects of life helps inject some variety into the mix, but the again does little to advance the plot leading to really a boring piece for me that was not worth the advertising build up. I know the paragraph is low, but I can't say much without revealing plots and spoilers, so I can only sum up that the tale does very little for me when it comes to an altogether piece.The VERDICT:Overall, Locked Down is a nice, artistic look at the realism of life when it comes to the current state of affairs, at least from the layman perspective. Those with an appreciation for realistic cinema, who want to experience COVID from potentially a new perspective will really enjoy this film and the thoughts/look that it brings. However, those that are looking for more of the entertainment element are going to want to skip this movie as it offers little in adventure, theater drama, crime/spectacles, or even comedic dive into awkward antics. All attempts at a twist to this kind of program did nothing to entertain or really divert from the realistic partake they wanted. And any attempt to deviate felt pointless for me and though offered some comedic moments, it did little for me in the overall performance. The problem is the advertising and branding of this film, because each of these categories gets twisted a little that some will love and some won't. Weighing this in, the following scores for this film are:Comedy/Crime/Romance: 5.0
Movie Overall: 4.0",Locked Down
10,arungeorge13,"As a rom-com, it's okay. As a heist film, it's not great! [+49%]",5,18 January 2021,"As a COVID-era rom-com, it works to an extent but Locked Down doesn't hit the intended highs it aspires for when it turns into a heist movie in the last act. In fact, the plotline suggested by the makers needs some rework. The heist (or the decision to conduct the heist) takes a good long while to get to. Until then, Locked Down is about a couple (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor & Anne Hathaway) going through a stressful pre-breakup phase in their relationship and dealing with the 'stuck indoors' life. Steven Knight's screenplays have always been a mixed bag. Some work because he's able to sketch his lead characters in interestingly quirky ways and some don't because they just seem like plot-forwarding accessories.What happens in the case of Locked Down is that the events leading up to the heist are actually more interesting than the heist itself. That last act feels entirely rushed, lazily written, and even though there are a few fun moments like the 'elevator truths', director Doug Liman fails to elicit actual tension. The longer, better-etched first two (or three) acts are funnier and more relatable. As far as the performances go, I quite enjoyed Anne Hathaway as the corporate CEO and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the hapless, desperate biker, but neither's unforgettable. There are a host of cameo appearances in the film that we mostly witness over Zoom calls (Ben Kingsley, Ben Stiller, Mindy Kaling, Stephen Merchant, and more), not necessarily adding much but their sheer presence making the experience slightly more enjoyable overall.Locked Down is a ""don't-think-too-much"" film that isn't downright awful, but its final act leaves a lot to be desired. The pacing (for a 2-hour long film) is pretty even, which works in its favour.",Locked Down
11,blott2319-1,Horribly written and frustrating reminder of this moment in time,2,25 January 2021,"I appreciate creators who are trying to do their craft in spite of the limiting conditions brought on by the current global pandemic. My biggest problem with Locked Down is that its storyline is so tied in with the pandemic that it is entirely frustrating. I will mention before going any further, that my personality is such that I prefer escapism from my movies. When I'm watching movies in the midst of a difficult time, the last thing I want is to be reminded of the difficulties. So, there is no pleasure derived from watching the horrendous problems brought on from trying to have an effective video conference. I don't find joy from watching a dwindling relationship, that is tested by constantly being with one another in isolation. It's like an agonizing reminder of the times we are living in, and the struggles we are dealing with day in and day out. Not only that, but this film will age horribly. I think some of the best movies have a timeless quality that makes them relatable no matter when you watch. Locked Down is the exact opposite. It is only speaking to an audience who is presently living through these times, and doesn't even give a fully realized vision of our time for future generations to utilize as a reference point of the COVID-19 pandemic.The other issue with Locked Down is that it tries to deceive the audience by feigning that the plot is about some kind of jewel heist. This could be an intriguing element and put a fun twist on what you'd expect from the film. However, there's no real ""heist"" in the traditional sense, and what there is to that storyline only serves as a minor B-plot compared to the bland relationship drama. It's also worth mentioning just how atrocious this script is written. There are no good jokes, or effective humor anywhere in the film, even though they are trying to be funny repeatedly. I believe that Ejiofor and Hathaway could deliver some clever and witty lines if they were given any, but they are left spouting pointless drivel. The bad scripting is even more apparent when it comes to the climax of the film, and the supposed ""heist."" This is handled with the subtlety and grace of an elephant tromping through a jungle. It's so stupid, and the conclusion is completely implausible. It feels like a small child wrote that part. I suppose if you're in a mental state where you find yourself just laughing at all we are going through in this pandemic (particularly if you find crumbling relationships to be charming,) then you might find some pleasure from Locked Down. To me it was torturous to sit through, and is bringing back bad memories even thinking about it now.",Locked Down

13,tm-sheehan,Opportunity Lost - not the Stars fault,5,10 July 2021,"My Review - "" Lockdown ""
My Rating 5/10I really don't like writing negative reviews of movies especially when I admire the two stars of the film but ""Lockdown"" really disappointed me plus I paid top dollar for an advanced screening on Prime.Billed as a Comedy / Crime /Romance ""Lockdown."" should have been fun starring Anne Hathaway as Linda and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Paxton a couple at the end of their relationship who are only still living together because of COVID lock-down orders in the U. K.
They are more flat mates (separate bedrooms) than a couple and their irritating bickering and conflict really made we wonder how they lasted in this relationship for as long as they have?The two attempt to navigate their new situations as COVID-19 spreads around the globe stuck together with each other after they've already decided to move on.That scenario is interesting to a point as we see Linda who is a top international executive having to terminate loyal staff on Zoom and Paxton who is a delivery man with a past criminal record who can't even work under his real name so uses an alias and fake ID as Edgar Allan Poe a name that any Security Guard would question !surely ?That's not enough in my opinion to sustain the first hour of this nearly two hour movie until we get to what should be the most interesting part and comical aspect of the plot ""the diamond heist"" at Harrods.The script is the problem for me not the actors both are struggling uphill to try and mine gold out of a tinny script by Steven Knight .The Director Doug Liman also has failed to make these characters come across with much humour or charm I found them both irritating and ill suited to each other.The great shame in my view is that if more attention had of been paid to the diamond heist at Harrods plot line instead of making it totally ridiculous and impossible perhaps there is a Comedy in this film somewhere.Plus perhaps a flashback or two when they were happy together may have helped but I doubt it?Instead of a romantic comedy we have cannon fire vocal conflict then make up sex and let's rob the most prestigious department store in the world.Paxton and Linda can't even make a decision whether they're both really serious or not about the robbery till the very last moment when they have the real and fake diamonds in their grasp and then they devise the most ludicrous and improbable escape strategy to dodge the Harrods security guards and cameras .This movie has some amusing moments but too few and too silly.I'm not sorry I saw it because I do like Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor but even these great talents couldn't make a silk purse out of this sows ear.",Locked Down
14,msbreviews,"LOCKED DOWN is a humorously clever, inoffensive film to watch in your free time.",6,23 January 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Watching a film set during a global pandemic while actually going through a global pandemic can have a significant negative impact on the viewer, depending on how the latter feels about the real-life problem. Honestly, my expectations were pretty low, but Locked Down is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had the luck of coming across in the last few months.Steven Knight's screenplay is humorously clever, packed with jokes about humanity's silliest behaviors during a lockdown. From the ridiculously amount of toilet paper rolls to the arguing about the most irrelevant, unimportant things at home, Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor deeply elevate a simple yet entertaining narrative with two incredibly amusing performances. Their chemistry is on-point, and their characters are equally funny.Doug Liman crafted a two-hour enjoyable, inoffensive, mostly realistic story of a couple in need of finding what made them fall in love... at least until the beginning of the utterly absurd third act. Yes, the whole movie follows a generic formula filled with cliches, but the last half an hour switches to a ridiculous heist mission that doesn't really connect with the characters or the story until that point (besides the dozens of logical issues it raises).Overall, I recommend it to anyone who has a couple of extra hours to watch something light on TV, but if you genuinely want to escape or forget about the current global situation, then maybe it's better to save this one for another time.Rating: B-",Locked Down
15,0w0,A very meh heist film,6,17 January 2021,"A lot of heist films are slow to start but when the heist actually kicks off then the pace of the film explodes, but with this film, it started out with a slow start and then continued on being slow until the very end of the movie... this makes for a pretty boring movie. The all-star cast means that the film has some good acting but no amount of good acting could raise this tortoise of a film above a 6/10 score unfortunately. It's slow. It's not particularly humorous. It has no action. That's why it all culminates in a depressingly dull heist film that scored a poor 5.5/10.",Locked Down
16,MrDHWong,Provides an adequate amount of entertainment for fans of romantic comedies and heists but never feels like it reaches its full potential,6,21 January 2021,"""Locked Down"" is a comedy heist film directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow). Starring Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor, it provides an adequate amount of entertainment for fans of romantic comedies and heists but never feels like it reaches its full potential.During the COVID-19 pandemic, all of London is in full lockdown, taking its toll on the mental health of bickering couple Paxton (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Linda (Anne Hathaway). Because of the restrictions, Linda's job as a fashion company CEO requires her to work from home via Zoom calls whereas Paxton can only make a living as a delivery driver due to his criminal past. One day, Linda informs Paxton that a diamond worth £3 million sold to an anonymous buyer is being kept in a safe at Harrods department store, and the two conspire a plan to steal it and split the money between themselves and the NHS (National Health Service).In addition to causing numerous deaths around the world, this ongoing pandemic is responsible for major disruptions to everybody, ranging from postponed events like the Olympic Games to travel industries taking a huge financial hit. Of course, something else that is suffering right now is the film industry, with production and release dates being halted on several motion pictures, so naturally it would be difficult for movies to be made right now, let alone shown in theatres. ""Locked Down"" managed to bypass most of these issues by shooting the film in a mere eighteen days at very few locations with real civilians sometimes being used as extras. For that alone, the filmmakers have done a commendable thing, however, there is little else worth mentioning about the film itself. As far as the plot goes, it's basically a standard romantic comedy with a heist thrown in near the end just to keep things from becoming stale. The only noteworthy feature is that all of this is takes place during one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, so I suppose you could consider this film among the first of its kind. However, once the novelty of such a setting wears off, there really isn't anything else this film can offer that we haven't seen before in other romantic comedies and heists of similar nature.Doug Liman, best known for directing fast paced action thrillers like ""The Bourne Identity"", takes a minimalistic approach here, instead opting for smaller scale sets like the inside of a London townhouse and the ever growing annoyance of not being able to go outside under lockdown laws as the driving force of the characters' motivations. For that reason, I'm not sure he was the right person for this job, as he doesn't really gel the whole romantic comedy-heist concept together as well as he should. For the film's first two-thirds, we watch our main characters dealing with the pandemic in their own ways, from Paxton reading poetry out loud in the street to Linda craving a cigarette under the stress of her daily Zoom calls. This would have been a great opportunity to explore the deeper connection these characters have with each other but it felt glanced over in favour of typical pandemic jokes like glitching online reception and panic buying. That's not to say these moments didn't provide their fair share of chuckles, it's just that for a romantic comedy to work properly, you need to actually care about the relationship between the lead characters. As for the heist itself during the final act, it's pretty fun for the most part, if not simplistic in its execution, as it felt more attuned to Liman's normal directorial style. Usually heist films require your full attention, as missing even the slightest detail can cause confusion in the viewer, but thankfully it is very easy to follow here, making the final result more satisfying to see.As much as I wish we could have seen a more in-depth look at their relationship together, I still enjoyed watching both Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway's interactions with each other, as the two do have decent chemistry. I particularly liked this one scene where Hathaway's character Linda went on a lengthy rant about why she took up smoking in the first place and how frustrating things have gotten due to her work being relegated to making online Zoom calls. This part definitely felt relatable considering how this is likely the case for many people out there being stuck working at home using computers to stay in touch with their fellow employees. There are other cast members like Ben Kingsley, Mark Gatiss, Stephen Merchant, and even Ben Stiller, but most of them are simply onscreen as part of a Zoom call, so it hardly felt like they were in the film as much as they were acting from the comfort of their own living rooms. This may have been done to add a feeling of realism but it still feels like a waste of some potentially great supporting characters that could have added a whole lot more to the story.With the way things are in the world right now, it doesn't seem like this pandemic will be ending anytime soon. Because of this, it seems all the more likely that there will be more films covering it as a topic for the unforeseeable future. Many years from now, ""Locked Down"" will be viewed as one of the pioneering movies of this newly emerged genre that still managed to be made despite the numerous obstacles in its way. It may well serve the purpose as a passable novelty during this bleak period, but once things have eased up, it will presumably be forgotten with time.I rate it 6/10",Locked Down
17,sweidman-28016,Very Boring and Nothing We Haven't Seen Already,4,28 January 2021,"""Being locked up is making it worse.""Welcome to January Movies! Today we have...a crime comedy written by someone with a bad track history and all the big stars who need new agents!Locked Down follows a couple that attempts a high-risk, high-stakes jewelry heist at a department store during the lockdown due to covid-19. I'm pretty sure the trailer came out maybe a week before this was released on HBO Max. Doug Liman has made some good movies in the past so there was a chance for this. Unfortunately, Steven Knight wrote this and has only written one good movie, that being Locke, and his latest being the train wreck that is Serenity (2019). Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but this is a January movie so I'm just gonna say it how it is. This is exactly what I thought it would be and I'm fine with that. Most of the issues come from the writing. Surprisingly I did like the writing at the beginning. There was some clever dialogue concerning covid-19 and how it has affected jobs and mental health. Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor give fine performances. Their monologues were performed well and they worked nicely together. But soon enough, the writing fails. Nothing happens until the last 30 minutes, I'm not joking. The beginning had me interested because I thought that would be a small portion. Then it continues to lecture us on stuff we already know for about an hour before even getting to the thought of a heist movie. Then for another 30 minutes they discuss the heist stuff, but I already lost interest. When the heist takes place, I didn't even know it had started because I was sitting on my phone. I will say that it's entertaining then, but it's only 30 minutes of a basic heist. This two hour movie could've cut at the very least 30 minutes because I gained nothing other than being bored.Doug Liman had a few moments of good directing. He just couldn't find a way to keep the audience engaged in the middle. Maybe this was trying for a realistic approach, but people don't want to see the boring parts that we forget about. There are so many cameos thrown throughout for us to point at the screen and say ""Wow! That's someone famous!"" But it feels almost exhausting seeing that many cameos. It feels like this was the movie that people decided to do to finish a contract. Anne Hathaway has faded pretty quick which is sad. She's a great actress and give a good performance almost every time. The movies just fail to draw in an audience or a positive review. In the end, this is a basic attempt at a comedy heist movie. With a few good moments and good lead performance, I found myself entertained from time to time, but I won't remember this in a year and I don't think anyone else will.",Locked Down

Chiwetel Ejiofor & Anne Hathaway are both excellent actors but the characters they play in Locked down are far too ridiculous, the dialogue they spew at one another is utter garbage.
Neither a comedy or a heist movie, anyone that thinks this is I strongly advise to not watch any of the various children's programs as you probably couldn't handle the humour & action they contain.

It will inevitably age like milk.
The cinematography is a bore and feels like it's zoomed-in and cropped from what this originally looked like. The script is also pretty bad. Chiwetel Ejiofors lines were especially bad and sounded like he was reading out of an old english novel or something. Big actors like Ben Kingsley, Ben Stiller, Mindy Kaling and Stephen Merchant are all subsided and left to boring ""zoom calls"" which feel extremely forced. Additionally, nobody sounds the way these people sounded when joining Zoom calls .. it's just weird.

39,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"A Quarantine Double Feature, Part 2: Locked Down",7,6 February 2021,"After suffering through Malcolm & Marie, I returned to this quarantine-inspired comedy, Locked Down, which premiered on HBO Max in January. Locked Down is another movie filmed in these COVID-quarantine times like Malcolm & Marie, and the main stars, Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor, do the heavy-lifting of sparring with each other and embodying the malaise of being locked down. This movie is billed as a comedy and crime thriller. Let's see how funny and thrilling it actually is.Locked Down takes place during the initial 2-week lockdown in London after the COVID-19 pandemic grabbed hold of the world. Hathaway and Ejiofor play Linda and Paxton, a couple who have been together for 10 years, but as their relationship is coming to an end, they find themselves stuck at home locked down. Linda is upwardly mobile as she's been promoted to CEO of a multi-national corporation; and Paxton feels stuck as a delivery driver due to his criminal record. Their diverging paths add tension to their relationship until those paths collide in an unexpected way. Doug Liman directs this movie, which could be construed as a romantic comedy - Liman directed The Bourne Identity and Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which may give a hint as to where this is going.When I first watched Locked Down, the Zoom calls and talk of quarantine was depressingly distracting. Ejiofor's character goes out into the street to read poetry to his neighbors who are also locked down; and Hathaway's character works from home and smokes at her window. It feels too close to home at times. Ejiofor and Hathaway argue back and forth like the couple from Malcolm & Marie, but their arguments feel substantive and have a lightness to them that's not so self-serious and self-righteous. The dialogue is funny, and Hathaway and Ejiofor have good on-screen chemistry. They pleasantly deliver their lines with such energy and wit. There are also some fun and unexpected appearances by other actors like Dule Hill, Stephen Merchant, and Ben Stiller - to name a few.Ultimately, Locked Down is just an enjoyable trifle of a movie. If you are going to watch a movie that constantly reminds you of our COVID-times, it might as well be one that is having a little fun with it, even if it does get ridiculous. Grab a bowl of popcorn and give Locked Down a stream.",Locked Down

The presentation of the film is just like any other medium budget comedy drama movie. Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance tried to uplift the movie but the only that did uplift the movie was few comic scenes and moments. Editing and screenplay both could have been better. The first half of the movie is filled with all the things that we in general did when we were locked inside our house house for months. Those scenes tried their best to make us connect with the movie and at one certain extent it almost did, until the second half arrived. With the second half the whole movie went from a lockdown drama to a GTA V heist thrill.

42,PerryAtTheMovies,Should've been locked down and never released....,5,24 January 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
The second film I've watched in the last little bit that attempts to relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and once again I feel left lacking. The point of movies is to get away from the thing you're trying to avoid. Some may say, ""Well then don't watch the movie."" You wouldn't be wrong in saying that, but then again, movies are also created to help you have a feeling of similarity and differential views of what you're experiencing, as well.For me this film had a bit more stability then the previous pandemic movie I watched, ""Songbird"" (2020). However, it is still hard to garner any appreciation for the film. For a couple that had been together for however long and now deciding to end things. There wasn't much of emotional animosity, resistance, or disparity between Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Neither was there much of any comfort or short of love feelings for each other. Just emptiness. Two mindless beings passing by each other.This film is two hours, but felt like it dragged for three. The film started off with a good, strong pace and for a brief moment I thought the reviews I had looked at were disgruntled viewers who liked to give 1/10 reviews. However, once all the blurry Skype calls begin. This is where it feels like the film comes to a screeching stop and then just putters along with the e-brake engaged. The only time where this film felt exciting is for the last fifteen or so minutes of the film, but by then I was glad things were ending.Honestly, there's no real positive point to this film. It's dreary, rainy England and all your watching is two people, who care, but don't care for each other for two hours until they finally leave their flat to do the heist. ""I Am Legend"" does a great job having one to two people act in its entirety and still be a great movie. Unfortunately, this film doesn't cut it.Overall:
If I ever watch this film again it'll be for background noise. It doesn't offer anything positive and truly felt like a waste of time. If you want to watch this film. Watch it at a time where wasting your night won't be a chore.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'No, I wouldn't waste my time to watch it.'Enjoy the show!",Locked Down

66,westerfieldreviews,The Quarantine Caper,5,30 January 2021,"Doug Liman returns to the director's chair to tell a timely story of living during a pandemic that bizarrely disconnects itself from the real world turmoil by attempting to develop two completely different stories. Locked Down is seemingly a film at odds with itself as Steven Knight's sporadic script takes you on a discombobulated adventure that fails to amaze. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway take center stage as the film's main leads and although their talents are sadly squandered, they functionally remain as the best components of the film. Both play conflicted characters caught at a crossroads that would have made for an interesting concept on its own, but unfortunately, the film chooses to forgo those possibilities through strange decisions. Liman's bombastic signature style is never fully realized in this tame film and Knight's strange script is absolutely at fault. Locked Down's narrative could have been something special as it truly is the first in a line of many films that will be centered around the lockdown the world is currently enduring. However, this film does nothing to speak on the actual events transpiring today and refrains from being a high octane quarantine heist film. Instead, it positions itself between two great ideas and does not succeed in telling either of them separately or as a whole.Locked Down brings us into the ordinary lives of Linda (Anne Hathaway) and Paxton (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who are a distant couple that has fallen out of love with one another at quite possibly one of the worst times imaginable. Paxton grips with the realities of losing everything while trying to evolve and become a better person than he has been for the past decade. Linda on the other hand has achieved her goals and climbed the corporate ladder all the way to the top but now finds herself at odds with her own self-identity. However, being cooped up in a home and living on two different floors is exactly what this estranged pair needed as together in unison they begin finding out why they fell in love with each other so long ago. This revelation is fully realized when Linda devises a scheme to rob her employer blind by stealing a precious diamond worth millions. But, this plan can only be pulled off with the help of the man she deeply loves the most, Paxton. Throughout the film, we witness how Linda and Paxton go from being physically and mentally withdrawn to finally realizing that what always existed between them.With Locked Down effectively providing the audience with two focal characters in Linda and Paxton, it is of the utmost importance that not only are they both interesting & captivating on their own with unique individual stories, but that they also share a united narrative thread that keeps their interactions engaging. Luckily for the film, in spite of its narrative pitfalls, Ejiofor and Hathaway help invigorate the script in ways it desperately needs. Given the circumstances at the start of the film, neither character wants anything to do with the other so it makes sympathizing with their relationship a tad bit difficult because we have no initial basis for understanding what romantic life the two used to share. However, as the story progresses, we get small peeks into what used to be and what could be between Linda and Paxton by way of small details sprinkled throughout. Even in the dialogue Knight manages to show the complexities of relationships to a serviceable level that feels somewhat believable and at times quite funny. Sadly, all of it winds up falling flat because Linda and Paxton as characters are almost total polar opposites that never feel closely connected. For all of the good Ejiofor and Hathaway provide in their respective roles, the chemistry between these stars is challenging to find. Barring a couple of minor scenes that occur near the tail end of the film, Ejiofor and Hathaway never appear to be romantic lovers throughout its nearly two-hour runtime, and the script fails to convey any deep emotions to support them. Instead, Ejiofor and Hathaway, and by extension, their characters, ultimately end up appearing as nothing more than people who are simply forced to interact due to the current conditions.Locked Down is an utterly baffling film at its core because of one single problem, the plot. Steven Knight constructs a story that feels entirely too disconnected from itself that it reaches lengths of unbelievability which hurts the overall quality of the work on several levels. Upon reading the brief synopsis for Locked Down found on the title screen of HBO Max I was intrigued, but after a quick glance at the overview on IMDb, I was truly confused. Unsure of what to make of the film, I jumped in with an open mind and found myself at a loss for words. On one hand, the film wishes to explore the complications of love and romance under the most disastrous of circumstances. But on the other hand, the film wants to be a smart high-octane heist film set in arguably one of the best times to pull off such a crime. Unfortunately, neither of those ideas were executed well enough and the final product suffered because of it. Had Ejiofor and Hathaway's talents been fully utilized to capture this tumultuous moment we are all living through it could have been something special. A film of introspection centered around finding oneself and discovering some of the dark and hidden truths about one keeps that they often neglect could have been masterful. Alternatively, a well thought out and calculated heist film set in the vacancy of the open-world could have also been excited and fun. However, the film ventures to do both when it simply can not. Fleeting moments of reflection are put forth and handled, but they are never fully addressed and expanded upon because once the second half of the film commences it decides to derail into a subpar heist movie that asks you to suspend your disbelief to incredible lengths. Without a clear line of focus, the film winds up devolving, as in an attempt to do two things at once, Locked Down finds itself unable to do either successfully.Locked Down is a film that serves as a true prisoner of the moment in all of the worst ways possible. Liman is not given the opportunity to direct a film that plays into his biggest strengths and pairing that with Knight's messy script only adds to the disappointment. Ejiofor and Hathaway seem to do the best they can with what they have and it works very well at times while collapsing into nothingness in others. A wide cast of expert talent is also present throughout the film who are all equally squandered in ways that will make you question why they were present in the first place. However, if one wishes to sit back and watch a decent film without getting lost in thought on the film's shortcomings, what is presented is just fine. The bottom line is, Locked Down struggles with grasping a tonal through line because it spreads itself thin by trying to do so much with so little by never addressing anything worth while.Final Verdict: C-",Locked Down

86,nicchang,Did anyone ask for this movie to be made?,3,5 February 2021,"The answer to that is NO and Locked Down is bound to be forgotten by the time COVID-19 finally passes.To get the positives out of the way, the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor made Locked Down incredibly watchable and they commit to their roles with effort, regardless of the bland nature of the script. It's admirable to see Locked Down aim for originality as it tries to mix a relationship drama, a pandemic setting and a heist plot together, so that deserves credit. While the setting is timely, the locations are portrayed fairly well, and ultimately, the low-budget filmmaking and gimmicks are more interesting to think about rather than watch Locked Down, because this was an opportunity for everyone involved to flex off how fast they can make a film.Locked Down is one of the more boring and unremarkable films of the decade. I can't recall a time where I laughed and the arguments and baggage between the unlikeable lead characters felt more annoying than emotional. Any dramatic stakes or sense of tension are set up poorly and the lack of character investment led to a spectacular anticlimax. For no good reason, Locked Down drags itself to an overlong 118-minute runtime and the sluggish pace may cause streaming viewers to switch to another programme. Because it doesn't have anything interesting or innovative to say, there's little effort in not just the writing, but also the bland musical score, flat cinematography and terrible editing. Doug Liman doesn't do anything intriguing in his direction and if anything, Locked Down feels like a corporate assignment he needed to do from HBO Max. But hey, I guess he and everyone involved had something to do rather than bore themselves to death during COVID-19. And they made this movie in less than three months, so... congrats?Plot and Characters (2/10)

88,LennardTeo,Relaxed Like A Hedgehog,10,14 January 2021,"Written by Steve Knight, who is one of three creators of the game show, ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", and directed by Doug Liman, whose last work was ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014), this Heist Comedy Movie was apparently shot in just 18 days in London. With the present pandemic, the scenes in Harrods also feature real people and employees, unlike the usual casting of extras.From the opening scene where a hedgehog is enjoying the nice weather in the garden of the main characters in ""Locked Down"", played by Anne Hathaway (Linda), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Paxton), who are trying to survive living together as a Couple during the lockdown when Boris Johnson was infected in March 2020. Although it is a Heist Comedy, the human realistic drama is illustrated over video conferencing calls where people are eventually fired online without warning.In a now familiar everyday environment, where masks, disinfectant, and limited number of people allowed, Linda and Paxton discover they have the opportunity to steal a $3 Million Diamond from a vault in Harrods, on the night of its store closure. If you are the kind of Person who watches a Trailer, then expects the Heist Movie to move at a certain speed, you are in for a nasty surprise. Remember I mentioned it is written by Steve Knight (""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?""), a seemingly expert at depicting human emotions when reaching the peak of 'The Moment'. Linda and Paxton's 'Moment' is when they decide to steal the Diamond, even though somethings are going wrong.A little bit of trivia is the Music Composer, John Powell, and Director, Doug Liman, have worked together before on 4 other Movies, with the first being ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002). Finally, Be Warned, ""Locked Down"" is Relaxed Like A Hedgehog, because it has long stretches of dialogue, the kind that can easily be dramatised in a Staged Play. Both Anne Hathaway (Linda), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Paxton) are a perfect acting duo for this Movie. Despite the sunken feeling of being ""Locked Down"" by the long stretches of dialogue, I enjoyed it. (Big Hint: the actual Heist only begins at around the 1 hour 28 minute mark.)",Locked Down

95,GGSteven_93,SOCIAL DISTANCE FROM THIS FILM!,3,16 January 2021,"Well, the formula of the film is the following: two thirds a bland and mediocre romantic comedy while the last third is a really rushed and way too easily resolved heist film.This atrocity here, might be the worst consequence of the pandemic to date. Steven Knight definitely misfired with his screenplay, throwing out any storytelling device that could've made the film at least a bit more entertaining. The screenplay tries to suggest certain things at time, but never cashes in on those ideas. These just remain hanging in there leaving the viewer frustrated. Also, Doug Liman seems absent, the film not impressing from a visual and artistic standpoint either, everything seeming quite bland. Also, it's worth mentioning that the film is far-far away from the heist adventure film that was presented in the trailers.Now, not be overly negative on the film, the two stars do a terrific job at playing two really frustrated and sexually repressed characters. Or maybe the actors were just frustrated themselves having to shoot this film, while they could've done million better things. It's either of those two options.Overall, the film drags on and feels pointless and without a concrete aim at times. If you don't want to bore yourself to death, maybe just skip it, there is not much to take away from this film. Keep at least a 6 feet distance from this atrocity!Score: 3/10.",Locked Down

In my humble opinion it happens to be one of the most underrated new movies ever.During the course of its 2hr runtime I and my better half felt the content was so relatable.I'm not just talking about the background with the empty London streets and traffic less roads, I'm talking about the strong writing which is brought to life by a talented lead couple that really perform their lines with so much passion, emotion and devotion that makes their characters true to life. Their crumbling mental health, lowered self esteem and marginal hope for a better future is all put on display.They discuss the past & the present, they hold secrets from one another, tell lies to each other, go through a perpetual cycle of make up and break up until fate unites them for one last act where they finish the movie doing something together.It reminded me of THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (another one of my all time favourite movies) that runs on the same sort of fuel - the first half is completely pointless but so watchable & intriguing and then during the second half, the male and female leads come together for a moment that unites them.Not everyone will get it, you need a brain & a heart for this kind of movie, and to those that do share both those prerequisites, you will admire it for what it is - different - 10/10",Locked Down

The pace of this movie is wonderful, it's like drinking a glass of wine. And then having another. And another. By its end you're intoxicated by the performances and the rich storyline. The unraveling of the two characters who were wound so tight releases a catharsis that is much needed these days.

144,joecranley,How about another pandemic era romance?,7,18 January 2021,"If you enjoy the sound of Apple ringtones this movie was made for you. The annoying trope of starting a scene with your protagonist rolling over to hit snooze on his or her iPhone gets old immediately and is repeated often. I harp on this so hard only because it is one of few complaints that I could think of when watching this movie. Locked Down does not bring to the table what you might expect from just another pandemic era romance. The climax of the movie centers around a grander theme of fate vs. free will, instead of some melodramatic event between Anne Hathaway and co-star Chiwetel Ejiofor- whose romantic highs and lows on screen were perfectly capable of pulling off the latter. The movie is still very much about the emotional toll of quarantine. Ejiofor plays Paxton, a broken mustang with a free spirit and the curse of an introspective mind. Paxton's character is described as funny in a very ""dry and witty way"". Ejiofor brings truth to that description with his performance. At the beginning of the movie, we see a version of Paxton who is haunted by the mistakes of his past and barely able to communicate with his partner, Linda. Hathaway's familiar nervous energy and her constant hair flipping, a trait affected for Linda, helps the star bring to the screen a type of character we've all gotten to know in this online, locked down world- the kind of person to smile and tell you they're doing just fine, but in reality they have been wearing the same pajama pants for the freaking whole movie.
In Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven, the raven represents the way that lost love and regret make the author feel. Poe's most famous work is a lesson to all of us that our pasts have as much power as we give them.
For Linda and Paxton, the past that tormented them so long has the power to change their lives- and even save their relationship ship.",Locked Down

Hathaway & Ejiofor go through immense dialogue and despite being strained as a couple, masterfully display connection on a deep level. Liman has masterfally captured the insanity of the COVID19 pandemic & how our worlds changed, some more than others, hopefully not forever.

The zoom calls with their glitchiness is a perfect metaphor for a life in which we were all trying new things. Not perfectly, not consistently, but we did it.

167,leadgold,Locked Down should be Locked Away,1,24 January 2021,"I don't normally leave reviews, but this movie is so terrible I felt I had to.First of all, it's supposed to be based during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they do such a horrible job portraying this. The movie might have been better if they left this factor out completely. I mean the only people who even wore a mask (in public) during the 2 long devastating hours this movie amounted to were the 2 main characters themselves.The writers spend so much time introducing more, and more (,and more) characters that have absolutely NO meaning or bearing to the story at all. I mean for a 2 hour movie, at least 30 minutes of it is devoted to unnecessary cameo appearances over a Zoom sessions. I love Ben Stiller as much as the next guy, but his 2 minute screen time wasn't going to save this horrible mess to come.Lets get to the act itself: The main actors are enduring the same hardship as the rest of the world is. The pandemic hasn't been easy on anyone and we can relate with the 'stay-at-home' environment our main actors are forced into. It's even tougher when going through a divorce and having to live with your significant other under the same roof. The only difference is, you'll quickly learn that this couple is apparently above the law. We'll watch them commit crimes such as:
outrunning the police (just for a joy ride)stealing food and liquor from a grocery store (just because...)committing a $3M heist (the synopsis of the movie that drew us to see what it was about)One of the main actors will reveal he has a criminal record. He'll frequently tell us ""I made a mistake just one time and I'm still paying for it..."". Well sir, you've made a ton more mistakes throughout this movie too. I guess we're still supposed to feel sorry for him because he's otherwise a nice guy when not high on Opium.All of their crimes are revealed to us ""to be okay"" and we should still feel sorry for them because it's the ""evil corporations"" they are attacking when they steal. Go figure...So now we have our social justice boundaries set; we know that rules don't apply two these 2 ignorant lovebirds. We're also supposed to hope they can pull of this big heist against an evil corporation. A heist that we'll then find ourselves 1.5 hrs into the movie and they still haven't done it yet.Anne Hathaway will bring nothing to this movie; she will always have a scene where she lights a cigarette and swears under her breath because it's the last one she has. We'll then listen to her rant for 10-15 minutes while watching the cigarette she lit that will never make it to her mouth. Of the 5-6 cigarettes she lights in each 10-15min rant scene, she will never even take one drag before it burns out or is put out.When there is just 30 minutes left in the movie we're finally at the plot itself: 'The Heist'... the very thing advertised about this movie that made us choose it in the first place. But sadly, there is no effort made here.
a mall with no security (but advertised as the most extreme security ever).guards at the front who will accept anyone in the front door without IDfull access to a 3 million dollar diamond guarded by 3 rent-a-cop guards who will hand it over if you ask.an empty mall without all stores closed yet wide open to public with all goods available. Our fun-loving heroes treat themselves to expensive wine and food here while they scheme on the roof.Quite honesty, I'm surprised they even committed the crime themselves. I'm sure they could have arranged Uber to pick the diamond up for them and bring it back to their place. Hell even the fake diamond was at least guarded by Piranhas; the real diamond might have been safer there.The diamond.... There is only about 15 minutes left of the movie when they finally pick this crown jewel that most of the audience is already asleep waiting for them to get to. No suspense what-so-ever; if anything we're relieved that the movie's almost over. 10 minutes to go and an employee who was previously fired by the very assailant stealing the diamond catches her red handed and she immediately confesses and reveals ""the entire plot"" to him. Seriously? Then, after confessing the entire crime and how much money they're going to get from the diamond, the employee says: ""No problem! I'm in it for the beauty! I won't tell"". <- Really?...5 minutes left of the movie and our love-birds are at home cuddling and bragging about how rich they are. Then we then see the movie credits. Seriously, save your money. Don't lose 2 painful hours of your life that you'll never get back.One star is a fair review; the one positive thing to say is: yes, there are a few funny jokes that are made and land well. But the 5 minutes of great jokes you find spread across the 2 hours of endless torture, bad writing, just isn't worth it./Rant",Locked Down
