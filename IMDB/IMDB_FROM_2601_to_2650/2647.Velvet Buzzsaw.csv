0,MartinHafer,Are pretentious art snobs the new stupid teenagers?!,9,15 November 2021,"In so many horror films of the last forty years, the victims of various malevolent killers has been annoying teenagers. Well, in ""Velvet Buzzsaw"" they find another group of annoying people and begin offing them in various gruesome ways....and they are pretentious art snobs...a group liked even less than teens!First, I should point out that currently the film has a score of 5.7 on IMDB...and this is confusing. My oldest daughter has told me that horror film fans love to hate horror films and rater them all very low...and perhaps this is the case...I don't know. But I scored this one a 9...and really thought it was VERY creative.The film is about an art collection discovered after the suicide of the artist. It seems that the dead man may have painted a thousand paintings and never sold or displayed them. Further, he destroyed some when he killed himself...and left instructions that the rest of his collection be destroyed. Unfortunately, one of these vacuous art snobs discovers the pieces. And, since the dead man had no family or any claims on the pieces, she takes them all and plans to make a name for herself selling these outsider paintings. Unfortunately, the paintings turn out to be evil.Overall, I have no idea why the film is rated so low. The story is fascinating, the acting exceptional and the story is thrilling.",Velvet Buzzsaw
1,Leofwine_draca,A film of two halves,5,8 February 2019,"VELVET BUZZSAW is the latest Netflix-released movie and a follow-up to Dan Gilroy's NIGHTCRAWLER, featuring the tag-team pairing of Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo once more. This time around the setting is the cynical and venal world of modern art collecting, where a bunch of characters come into contact with weird works of art belonging to a recently-deceased artist.It's definitely a mixed bag of a movie, one in which the bad has equal measure with the good. The film is split into two distinct halves; the first is the scene-setting world-building of modern art, and it's this that's most interesting, offering a fresh and vivid take on a kind of niche world that few of us will ever encounter. The characters are quirky and interesting, if not exactly likeable, although there are perhaps a few too many for any individual to stand out. Sadly, the second half of the film descends into a simplistic supernatural horror film of the kind we've seen done a million times before; thrown-in CGI blood and predictable scares simply don't cut it and waste an intriguing premise.",Velvet Buzzsaw
2,nogodnomasters,What is the point of art if no one sees it?,7,18 May 2019,"Rhodora Haze (Rene Russo) runs the Haze Art Gallery. In the 1980's she was a member of the punk group, Velvet Buzzsaw. Josephina (Zawe Ashton) works for her. Piers (John Malkovich) is an artist she exhibits. Morf Vandewalt (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a bisexual art critic who makes and breaks artists. He is off and on with Josephina, who also dates artists.We get of ton of character development. Josephina discovers paintings by dead artist Vitae Dease. Dease ordered his painting destroyed. Josephina rescues them.The art had a strange ""Twilight Zone"" effect on people.This is another WTF Jake Gyllenhaal film.Guide: F-word. Brief sex, brief partial nudity.",Velvet Buzzsaw
3,kosmasp,Something wrong with Dease,8,13 October 2021,"Art can be killer ... literally. How much and it what capacity ... well you have to watch this to find out. Now I understand that some may have hoped for more. But as it is and all the performances in the movie being top notch (especially considering the idea this is running on), the movie delivers the goods (no pun intended).I remember that I wanted to watch this when it was announced back then - but I never had the opportunity. It might not have played anywhere near where I live or something along that line. I finally got the opportunity - an opportunity is also what kickstarts the whole ... mayhem. While I am glad I used it, the characters in here very likely would change their decision if given the chance .. bloody, inventive and as gruesome as a horror movie can and should be. Not many likeable characters, but something has got to give ...",Velvet Buzzsaw
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Off the wall, but enjoyable.",7,14 February 2019,"There is something so original about this film, which is basically a group of pretentious art experts being done to death by art.I'll applaud it for imagination, for being unique, and for featuring some incredibly good scenes, in particular the demise of Josephina, but the real winner here has to be the acting. The cast are incredibly good, when you have Jake Gyllenhaal and Toni Collette in a film together you know it'll be pretty good. Gyllenhaal is absolutely terrific, and steals the show.I really did enjoy the concept, it's one of those films I liked, but wouldn't particularly rush to watch again, I think once you have seen the surprises once, it kind of doesn't have much else in terms of content.",Velvet Buzzsaw
5,evanston_dad,"Don't Know What That Was, But I Liked It",8,20 July 2020,"Well I don't know what that was, but I know I liked it.The business of art and the pretentious people who make its little insular world go round is already such a caricature of itself that a satire of it feels unnecessary. But I'm ok with one if it manages to be as wildly and weirdly entertaining as this satire, which is half laugh out loud comedy and half supernatural horror film. Actors like Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Toni Collette, and John Malkovich show not a bit of restraint in bringing to life flamboyant characters that are all a good three or four degrees more exaggerated than any people you would actually ever meet in real life, and they're all fabulous. They're clearly having a great time, and they're all so obnoxious, and know that they're obnoxious, and know that we probably think they're obnoxious, that as we see them get picked off one by one by a malevolent force lurking in the artwork of some obscure painter that becomes a sensation in the art world, we can enjoy sitting back and watching them all get mangled without having to feel bad about enjoying it.And good grief could Jake Gyllenhaal look any better with his clothes off? Please tell me that there's a lot of CGI at work, or at least copious amounts of body makeup, because otherwise he just makes me want to give up my gym routine as woefully inadequate.Grade: A-",Velvet Buzzsaw
6,ferguson-6,monkeys in the mirror,6,9 February 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Filmmaker Dan Gilroy has distinct ideas on how to make his movie stand out from the cluttered maze of Netflix: give elitists a violent comeuppance, and allow Jake Gyllenhaal the freedom to take his character over the top. Not only has Mr. Gilroy reunited with Mr. Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo, his leads from the excellent NIGHTCRAWLER (2014), but he has also assembled a deep and terrific ensemble of actors who understand exactly how to present the material ... even if some viewers will be confused, startled, or unimpressed.What begins as a parody of the highfalutin contemporary art world, slowly transforms into a satirical-supernatural-horror film that judges severely those who drive the profit train by peddling art. Morf Vandewalt (Gyllenhaal) is the flamboyant art critic who possesses God-like abilities to make or break an artist with the words he chooses for his reviews. His work often intersects with Rhodora Haze (Ms. Russo), who runs the largest gallery in the city. She was once part of a punk rock band (from which the film takes its title), and now she lives to cash in on the work of others. As she so eloquently describes, she has moved ""from anarchist to purveyor of good taste"". Other players include Jon Dondon (Tom Sturridge) as Rhodora's competitor, Gretchen (Toni Collette) as an agent, Bryson (Billy Magnussen) as a whip smart handyman, Coco (Natalia Dyer) as a Midwestern girl trying to make it in the big city, Piers (John Malkovich) as a blocked artist who regrets quitting drinking, Damrish (Daveed Deeds) as an up and coming artist, and Josephina (Zawe Ashton) as Rhodora's ambitious assistant.The story shifts tone when Josephina discovers the artwork left behind when her reclusive elderly neighbor Mr. Dease dies suddenly. Dease is unknown as an artist and was in the process of destroying his life's work when he died ... he wanted no part of the art world, other than creating his own work. Josephina seizes on this opportunity and works with Rhodora in representing the work of this ""hot"" artist. As the work is monetized, the supernatural forces take over - often in quite violent ways. The players are so focused on how to capitalize on the work, it takes them an inordinate amount of time to realize evil forces are afoot. No one escapes scrutiny: artists, critics, agents, or collectors.In cinema, if you choose to go bat**** crazy, it's best to not hold back. Gyllenhaal plays Mort full tilt and he's immensely fun to watch. The extraordinary ensemble cast benefits from some unusual and vivid imagery supported by expert cinematography from Oscar winner Robert Elswit (THERE WILL BE BLOOD). It's rare for so much social commentary to be included in a project that could easily be compared to a teen slasher. There is some excellent dark humor, though maybe not quite enough, and two art exhibits in particular are memorable: Hoboman, and the Sphere. There are some clear cut groups of people in the film: the hot youngsters (Josephina, Dondon, Damrish) vs. the establishment (Mort, Rhodora, Piers) vs. misguided wannabes (Gretchen, Coco, Bryson). No matter their approach, one of the messages shines through - artists invest their soul into their work and that often stands in direct conflict with the other side of money and commerce. We can be a bit forgiving the film's faults given the ambitious nature of the project; just be cautious of the monkeys in the mirror.",Velvet Buzzsaw
7,trashgang,"trailer much better, in fact the trailer tells it all",5,25 February 2019,"Was looking forward to see this one because the trailer looked rather good. Once started I was into it but lost it very quickly. The reason is simple, not that much is happening the first hour except talking and having affairs between straight people and gays.Once the paintings come alive it's all too late and even that isn't that noticing. Okay, there's blood and people die but to be honest. The trailer was better than the flick itself.Gore 0,5/5

8,deloudelouvain,Should have been better with this cast.,6,10 February 2019,"When you see the names of the actors and actresses in this movie you expect something really good. The truth is that Velvet Buzzsaw could have been much better. It's not that I didn't like watching it but it didn't give me complete satisfaction. The acting was good, as expected, but the story was just not that interesting, too far fetched, maybe original but not that captivating. As for the horror parts they're just minimal and could have been done much better. There's too much posh people making a big deal out of art, it worked for awhile but not for the entire movie. Velvet Buzzsaw is worth a watch but I won't watch it a second time.",Velvet Buzzsaw
9,thesar-2,Buzzkill,1,30 March 2019,"Whelp, I guess the people who LOOOOVED ""The Neon Demon"" are gonna LOOOOVE this.In other words, ""art"" can definitely be (doo-doo) sometimes.Seriously don't want to waste ANY MORE TIME on this piece of crud, but the gist is that I hated everyone. One might argue...damn, now I'm sounding like these pretentious a-wipes. (Man, I'm going to have to spend a lot of time censoring myself before publishing.) In other words, that might be the point. We're *supposed* to hate them. But, are we supposed to waste two hours of our precious time on Earth watching fools and downright horrible, disgustingly bad jerks get picked off?The movie's set in the art world and though this might be an accurate portrayal, I will never, ever want to find out. One person wants to advance - though we're only told that, we never feel it - and she finds art of a dead man and uses it to, well, advance. Only...there's a price!!Seriously, there isn't one character you don't absolutely loathe here. And they all act like we're supposed to believe this is how real artists and dealers act. I don't think any rational person would sign onto this project and coach the actors on how they act in reality. If anyone claims these actions as their own, let them get lynched.Just don't see this movie. It takes too long to get to what it's about and by then, you despise everyone. So, why continue? Okay, fine, people that we hate get knocked off. I already wrote them off in the first long half and never cared where they ended up. They never gave me half a spark to care to see them on screen any longer in order to get to the deaths.Not all art should be appreciated. One person's junk is everyone's trash.***Final thoughts: I love going into movies cold. I do my absolute best to do so. In this case, I knew it's being reviewed on the podcast ""Shockwaves"" and a friend recommended it to me at work. THAT'S ALL I knew about it. Once again, I have to be in the minority as I guess the podcast crew loved it and my friend already endorsed it. I can't wait to bash it when I return to work and tell her to hold off on more recommendations until I change my going-in-cold desire.",Velvet Buzzsaw
10,FeastMode,my notes,1,27 July 2019,"This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i almost stopped it 8 minutes in but it was a recommendation by Samie so i kept going. i made it to 27 minutes before watching it on fast speed. even with that, could barely make it to the hour mark. watched an explanation video to fill in the rest. smh. what a waste of time.the dialogue was basically gibberish to me. it would be like someone who knows nothing about sports listening to sports analysis. it's excruciatingly boring. and it's about art. i HATE this movie (1 viewing)",Velvet Buzzsaw

I can't say a lot because there wasn't a lot happening. Boring movie literally about nothing. Only NETFLIX can spend millions of dollars for that kind of ""films"".

12,ThomasDrufke,Death By Art,5,9 July 2019,"I'm all for weird and obscure films. David Lynch has put together some epically strange films and television seasons, so a horror/thriller based around an art heist? Sure, why not. The result? A visually fascinating, sometimes horrifically obscure (especially if viewing at night) but ultimately a hollow narrative that thinks it is much better and more clever than it actually is. I won't pretend I'm smart enough to say the movie is really some sort of metaphor or satire, but I do typically know when a movie is well put together. Velvet Buzzsaw is certainly not one of those.5.0/10",Velvet Buzzsaw
13,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,12 February 2019,"Velvet BuzzsawThe key to being a great artist is the ability to sketch the nude form without being arrested or sued.The crimes in this horror movie however are being committed by the artwork itself.An up-and-coming art agent uncovers captivating canvases painted by a dead neighbour that she takes to her gallery owner boss (Rene Russo) and to her ex-lover (Jake Gyllenhaal), L.A.'s top art critic, for appraisal. While the collection is eventually deemed priceless and curators (Toni Collette) begin to clamour for pieces, everyone who has viewed the paintings has subsequently been killed in artistic fashion.Backed by an impressive cast playing unlikable characters and a unique concept that is never fully realized, this cerebral shocker never strikes the right balance between the visceral horror and the highbrow elements it keeps adding to the pot.Nevertheless, with murderous artwork hanging in your gallery you'll never need a security system.

14,851222,Great mystery horror story,8,22 October 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.I was really surprised after i finish to ""Velvet Buzzsaw"" (2019) that is has such a low score on Imdb and so many negative reviews - i found this movie really interesting and spooky little mystery horror movie. I did not read anything about it before seeing it and was very surprised of how involving this movie was. And then suddenly i took unexpected turn and became this very involving mystery horror movie.Overall, ""Velvet Buzzsaw"" for me was a very involving mystery horror movie. I found its story involving, acting great and directing as well writing very solid. This is a really good movie in my opinion. Maybe majority found this movie to be different then thought it will be and that is why they did not like it. Other then that, its a great film.",Velvet Buzzsaw
15,Floated2,Interesting concept falls short,6,5 March 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is a more recent Netflix Original film, and there did seem to be some hype surrounding the film. Mainly since it is made by the same director who directed Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler. Velvet buzzsaw has somewhat of a similar feel in tone to Nightcrawler, but lacks a lot of brilliance and overall intrigue we saw in Nightcrawler.This film is quite different and unique and has an interesting premise but at most, it feels somewhat like a television series (not in a good way). Jake does a decent job but most of the other cast aren't well thought or intriguing enough and the film is more of a 3-person lead than simply just Gyllenhaal which the trailers seemed to make us believe. Buzzsaw has a slow start, slight picks it up and has a great to watchable finale (once the ""deaths"" begins). Overall we can't help but feel that this film could have been more entertaining, more boundary pushing and just overall better.",Velvet Buzzsaw
16,TheMovieDiorama,Velvet Buzzsaw attempts to creatively cut through contemporary commercialism but slices itself in half.,5,4 February 2019,"The subjectivity of art is one that is often discussed amongst many people. Whilst someone might view a pile of newspapers on a wooden floor as rubbish, another may view as a piece of extrasensory masterclass in art. Critiquing another's work may make or break their career, and so I find myself reviewing this satirical horror as an ironic gesture. Gilroy found much fame with his directorial debut 'Nightcrawler', however his proceeding films (including this) have not even come close. A mysterious death is witnessed to which an array of paintings soon make their way into the mainstream of prestigious contemporary art galleries. However, as more peculiar deaths occur, an art critic believes the paintings are spiritual and could be the primary cause.A satirical commentary on the greed and overwhelming wealth of art dealers, and how they unfairly monopolise on visual creations that should be seen by everyone. Those that live off the profitability of the art that they sell, soon meet their demise as the paintings in this film temporarily come to life. An interesting premise that is disappointingly unexplored as Gilroy attempts to creatively balance satire, horror and drama. Unfortunately for him, each aspect is undercooked and merges into one splat of dullness. Gilroy's acute directing style from before has almost ""completely evaporated"". For a film about art, one would've expected some creative flair or atleast one ingeniously designed shot. Alas, much like the schlocky horror scenes, the boring direction made the film feel incredibly cheap and basic. Frustrating! Why? Because the talented cast, aside from Ashton who was diabolically dreadful, all gave excellent performances. Gyllenhaal especially (the beautiful beast that he is) was sensational yet again as a bisexual art critic. His mannerisms and snobbish behaviour exhumed a high-profile individual perfectly. He almost singlehandedly saved this film, but unfortunately was given a simplistic script that focused on skewing the world of art instead of developing its characters. The horror element didn't work for me either. Aside from one or two well executed chills, particularly the robotic sculpture in the storage facility, all the visuals looked horrific and mostly consisted of jump scares.It's safe to say the vibrancy of this picture is in Gilroy's commentary on the high-end art industry, but it's not the artistic statement he had in mind and is another case of squandered potential. He had a blank canvas in his hands, and yet chose to use dull watercolours as opposed to bright oils.",Velvet Buzzsaw
17,southdavid,.... with a dull edge.,4,7 February 2019,"Having enjoyed Dan Gilroy's previous film ""Nightcrawlers"" I was disappointed with this follow up, that reunites director with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo, but feels overblown and unsure of what it wants to be.Zawe Ashton plays Josephina, who discovers a cache of hitherto unknown art created by a reclusive neighbour who has passed away. Along with her boss, gallery owner and dealer Rhodora Haze (Russo) and the art critic Morf Vandewalt (Gyllenhaal) they work to exploit the find for maximum profit. However, as Vandewalt discovers more about the troubled history of the artist, the pictures begin to take on a literal life of their own, and those involved in manipulation of the pieces begin to die.I like to think of myself as being pretty cinema literate. I'm aware of the idea of subtext. I feel like ""Velvet Buzzsaw"" thinks it has that, but only from interviews with Gilroy do I understand that, because I'm not sure it's actually there in the plot. Maybe I'd see it more if the ""rules"" of the film were a little clearer. Logically I feel it should be that the artwork generated by the neighbour should come to life and punish those that are exploiting it, but that's not what happens and people are killed by artworks entirely unrelated to central thrust of the story. But even if we accept that the subtext is there, and I just didn't catch it, I still don't think there's much to appreciate about the film.It's seems very dismissive of its relatively simple horror concept, so much so that it's unwilling to engage properly with that aspect of the story, it views it like it's a necessary evil to keep the story going. It's far more interested in its wide ranging tale of various artists and dealers and what they're doing. It's a great cast that the film has, add Toni Collette, John Malkovich, Natalia Dyer and Billy Magnussen to the already mentioned talent, but much of their stories (all of it, in some cases) add nothing to the actual plot. I also felt, despite its lengthy run time that bits of the film were ""missing"". The first time we see Gyllenhaal's character seeing one of the paintings move, he reacts and comments as if this is something that has happened to him already, then immediately the plot jumps to him halfway through a mental breakdown.Dull and disappointing, Netflix remains a dumping ground for features terrified of the scrutiny of a cinematic release.",Velvet Buzzsaw
18,imseeg,NOT a thriller at all. NOT funny either. What's left?,4,8 February 2020,"I tried to like it, but I cant help feeling that from the get go this was ANOTHER movie that merely WANTED to PRETEND to be something it truly wasnt, because it simply was NOT thrilling whatsoever, nor was it ever really funny.Never true to life. Exaggerating characters can work when it's done with subtlety, but this story merely represents it's characters as flat stereotypes, who never become believable or persons whom I can sympathize with in any kind of way.Another wannabe ""look at me being quirky"". Simply BORING.",Velvet Buzzsaw
19,jtindahouse,The opposite of everything I wanted it to be,4,9 February 2019,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I came across a Netflix horror movie titled 'Velvet Buzzsaw' and starring an incredible cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, John Malkovich, Toni Collette and Rene Russo. Good horror movies are so rare these days and I thought with a cast that strong someone must have written a masterpiece of a script that these actors simply couldn't turn down. Unfortunately I was very wrong. They were simply attracted to the fact that the director's previous films had been met with mild forms of praise and that it was a pretentious script with a ""message"" in relation to appreciating art. Yuck.The problems with 'Velvet Buzzsaw' start with the fact that every character is intentionally made to be completely unlikeable and a despicable human being so that they will later get their comeuppance. The reason that doesn't work though is that it's no fun for the audience to watch awful characters and we certainly can't root for them to survive.The next problem falls on just how boring the film is. Endless scenes of inane dialogue that you'd have to be a saint not to switch off during. Painfully boring stuff. Also it doesn't help that none of the lead actors put in much of a performance at all. I compare Collette to what we saw she was capable of in 'Hereditary' to this. Worlds apart. Malkovich to even just what he's capable of in 'Bird Box' to this. Worlds apart. Gyllenhaal to what he's capable of in just about every other film he's ever been in. Worlds apart. No actor in this film is very good at all.The film tries to make up for its incredibly slow pace with a fast paced ending, but by then it is far too late. The audience has checked out. There's also the odd beautifully crafted shot, and in a better film these would have been a treat. Sadly though 'Velvet Buzzsaw' is a complete misfire and not worth your time or energy on Netflix.",Velvet Buzzsaw
20,DarkVulcan29,Well made spine tingling tale,9,4 February 2019,"It feels like a Tales from the Crypt episode stretched into two hours, if you are into that kind of movie, then Velvet Buzzsaw is that film for you. The film takes it time developing characters and then the horror comes into play, and when it does, never disappoints in the least.Imagine if you find paintings, and bad things start to happen, that is basically the film in a nut shell. A lot of the characters are not very likable, but that's the drive of it. Rene Russo really plays her role well, has somebody you just enjoy hating. Jake Gyllenhaal is also good, never seems to be overacting, plays it with conviction.The movie is more about people who don't understand art, and the meaning behind it.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Problem is the outcome is fairly predictable a half hour in with little for the audience to do but await the next creative way to eliminate a surly player.Jake Gylenhall has a field day playing the narcissisitic art critic Morf Vanderwalt. A preening, self pitying, weasel he oozes a smugness that demands comeuppance. Toni Colette is also wonderfully over the top but these are the only two characters in the film that seem to resonate with director/writer Gilroy's sardonic send up of the LA art world while the rest of the cast sulks or work on their resume to be offed by the closing credits.Robert Elswit's photography is his usual outstanding stuff ( that introduction of the LA night shot is 2001) and he does his best to cover what is being telegraphed but outside of the well written well played character of Morth Velvet Buzzaw is little more than slasher drive-in fair, cheap thrills not priced low enough.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Velvet Buzzsaw is his latest work that he both wrote and directed and while I did enjoy some of it, this director only has one home run in my book, which still remains to be Nightcrawler.Velvet Buzzsaw does work and is worth checking out mainly to Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo .

There is also very less attention given on the history of the paintings or it's creator maybe the maker wanted to keep it under wrap but it creates more confusion.Acting is either at par or below par with only Jake Gyllenhaal doing the job with perfection as rest of the cast we either awkward or looked forced upon.Screenplay of the movie is slow and doesn't keeps you engaged to the plot, climax of the movie gets predictable as the movie approaches it's end.

Over the top perhaps, but this is satire. The pictures painted by Dease seem somehow cursed or haunted causing other art works to come to life in lethal manners. A painting animates, colours flow and kill.

27,aidanratesmovies,Gyllenhall and Gilroy shine again,9,21 August 2020,"A smart, biting, and often thrilling satire- Velvet Buzzsaw is certainly not for everyone, but to me, it is certainly a work of art. The film contains a very talented, and often brilliant cast, and I couldn't find a performance I didn't enjoy seeing throughout this film. With such a large cast, it is hard to pick all the standouts, though I certainly enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's great performance as Morf Vanderwalt, as well as Zawe Ashton's performance as Josephina, and Toni Collette being brilliant as always as the peculiar character of Gretchen. The film does start off a bit slow, which is one of its greatest flaws, as it feels like it takes a bit of time to gain steam, but eventually the film does. The film is shot incredibly well, and when it needs to be, the film is incredibly thrilling and quite a bit scary- which I enjoyed. Dan Gilroy's writing style is as great as always, as well as his directing skills being put to the test in such a smart cautious thriller. You may not understand it all, but it is no reason to doubt a film that truly knows what it wants to be, and how to tell its tale. You may not enjoy its style, its progression of story, or even its subject matter, but Velvet Buzzsaw is able to do something not many films have recently done- that meaning, being able to be an original and provocative thriller while also managing to settle its ambitions into quite a strong package. Like art, some will get the film, some will not, but in the end, there is no doubt, it is something very unique.

28,s3276169,Velvet Buzzkill.....,5,22 September 2019,"The styling of this film is interesting, offering a perspective on the shallow but at the same time ruthless and cut throat world of high end art. This is blended with what could be described as a horror morality tale, where greed is repaid with bloody interest.Regrettably, this film is ultimately a buzz kill. Its story feels incomplete, like a half finished work of art. You can see the sketched outline of what its trying to achieve but its never completes the picture.This is most notable in the story which seems to me at least to be truncated. Perhaps, the original idea would have taken too long? Its a shame the extra time was not taken, as this actually did look like it was going somewhere intriguing. As a result characters inexplicably go from one state of mind and action to another, without any real segue.The result is a film I 'sort of"" liked but at the same time felt dissatisfied with. It has its clever moments but another twenty or so minutes I feel would have made all the difference. 5/10 from me.",Velvet Buzzsaw
29,valleyjohn,The worst film I've ever seen released on Netflix,2,3 February 2019,"Pretentious, badly written and mostly boring this film is a disgrace. To even mention Night Crawler in the same sentence is just wrong .

30,truemythmedia,Meh...,5,25 July 2019,"There are movies that really grab you, and Dan Gilroy's ""Nightcrawler"" was one of those movies for me. That film, also starring Jake Gyllenhall (""The Sisters Brothers"") was a brutally brilliant look at the cutthroat tactics it takes to start a business; it had a lot to say, but it also boasted amazing performances from Gyllenhall and Riz Ahmed (""Venom""). I was so enthralled with that film that I immediately put Dan Gilroy on my 'Directors to Watch' list. The moment I heard about this film, I looked forward to in with rapt anticipation.Unfortunately, as they say, lightening doesn't oft strike the same place twice.There were some cool themes and ideas here, but they just aren't flushed out enough for me to care. Making a message is fine, but that has to come second to telling a story that moves people. If message trumps story oftentimes we only feel like we're sitting through an overtly didactic lecture. This movie wasn't a lecture, but at times it was certainly as boring as one.",Velvet Buzzsaw

32,davidmvining,The horror mechanic make the movie,8,22 November 2019,"As this movie ended, I was much more mellow about it. There are too many characters that needed paring back and I didn't think that the central horror mechanic really worked, but I found the movie entertaining enough on its own.I kept thinking about that mechanic, though, and I steadily grew in my appreciation for the film.A struggling gallery employee lives in the same building as an old man who dies in the hallway. Inside his apartment are a thousand paintings he created over several decades. The artist's instructions were to destroy the paintings upon his death, but the woman, Josephina, takes them all and works with her employer to sell them to the art-loving world.We steadily learn some of the artist's history, but only just enough. He was drafted in World War II, spent time in a mental hospital, survived a house fire that killed his mother and sister, but not his father. He even killed his father. And that's about all we learn from straight dialogue, but there was one element that I was largely ignoring, the art itself.So, before I dig into that, let me continue with the story a bit. The movie transitions from a light satire of the modern art world into a horror movie, and falters a bit because of the aforementioned plethora of characters. Dan Gilroy, writer and director, obviously loved the bevy of characters he created and didn't want to cut them back. I can't really blame him because there isn't a character I found pointless in the bunch. From John Malkovich's stymied artist Piers to the assistant Coco who ends up finding almost every dead body in the movie as she goes from job to job, there really isn't a weak character in the bunch. However, it creates a cloud of confusion in the middle section as we spend so much time with them instead of on the horror that things just get a bit muddled.The horror itself is that the artist's work is possessed with his soul, but the paintings themselves don't do any of the killing, it's the art around it that does it. That mechanic felt out of step with the theme of the film, which is about imbuing the art with the soul of the creator. However, as I thought of the idea after the movie was over, I remembered some of the paintings we saw and drew so much attention from the characters. There are many paintings of a boy and a girl, but there's one in particular that shows three figures, a boy, a girl, and an larger male figure. The boy is protecting the girl, who's screaming, and the boy is striking out against the father. Suddenly, the point of the horror mechanic became blindingly obvious. I was listening to the artist, but not figuring him out myself.That picture shows the artist as a boy protecting a weaker person from the stronger. The artist's soul isn't out to protect itself in the form of the paintings (it doesn't need it since everyone loves the work), but it's out to protect its younger siblings. Everyone who dies has been dismissive against the art that kills them in some way. The most prominent example is in the trailer. Toni Collette puts her arm in a giant sphere which eats the arm and lets her bleed out. When she first saw it in the beginning of the movie, she didn't like it and insulted it. So, the artist's spirit allowed the sphere to defend itself against its detractor.The art critics get it good and hard.When I figured this out, my appreciation of the movie jumped. I went from thinking it was pretty good to really good. There are still too many characters muddling things especially in the middle section, but the horror mechanic is smart and really well thought out. I kind of loved it.",Velvet Buzzsaw

34,rivertam26,Intriguing dissection of the art world,7,23 August 2020,"Written and directed by Dan Gilroy of Nightcrawler this is a unique film unlike anything you've ever seen for better or worse. The aptly titled Velvet Buzzsaw stars Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler), Toni Colette (Hereditary), Renee Russo (Ransom), Zawee Ashton (Nocturnal Animals), Tom Sturidge (On the Road), John Malkovich (Red), Billy Magnussen (Game Night) and Natalie Dyer (Stranger Things). It's an awesome cast in a movie that works as a dissection of the Art world. The vapid, hollowness of exchange. The charachters and storyline are more symbolic than actually fully realized entities. The movie isn't completely successful at all its endeavors but it's ambition is intriguing and the results are polarizing. It's no doubt a horror film but it's definitely an indie art film as well combined with a hefty budget and stylish direction. This is definitely a film you will either like or hate but I was definitely a fan.7/10",Velvet Buzzsaw
35,gedikreverdi,Only Coco got back home alive... with his cat,7,19 February 2021,"Josephine's neighbor was dead and his flat was full of his paintings which where valuable works of art. Then after she heard that they'd be disposed of, she took them all and rhodora helped her sell them. Jon the rival of rhodora hanged himself, Bryce had an accident and got burned after he's discovered that he's been carrying works of him and the monkeys at the painting on the wall of the abandoned gas station took him in the painting. Morf got suspicious of these works of art are haunted after Gretchen the lovely Toni Colette died after her arm got stuck in the sphere on display and she bled to death. It was really funny how her dead body was displayed for visitors including kids until coco came and noticed her. Morf wanted to get rid of all his works but at the storage units the Hoboman robot that was displayed in one of their exhibitions stalked him and killed him. Josephina's death was particularly impressive: she was sucked into the graffiti with all the painting of different colors covered her body across the sleazy bar. Then rhodora got rid of all the works of art in her house and thought she got away with it but the saw tattoo in her neck written velvet buzzsaw cut off her neck. Finally coco the dead body finder got back home with his cat found in his apartment home because she lost her job again. The artist's background story about him
being abused as a kid and locked up at a mental institute as a prisoner after he killed his father by burning him and lives off the grid for decades was a bit superficial as we didn't even properly see his face except for a moment before Bryce had an accident with the trunk.

38,educallejero,The horror part failed the dramatic character driven part,5,2 February 2019,"I would say this first. For some reason Netflix movies always find a way to look cheap. In this case, the cinematography was great and ""film worthy"", until they started to use weird and dated transitions that weren't even close to appropriate for the movie. I'm talking fades to black, Star Wars type of transitions that are great for Sci-Fi, but not for this.Besides that, another awful thing on this movie is Zawe Ashton and Daveed Diggs ""acting"". Both were wooden, but at least he has the excuse that he didn't have that much to do. She's one of the protagonists and oh boy, was that pathetic.And it wasn't that her character ""was cold and calculated"". Not at all. Her character makes rushed choices out of emotion all the time. And yet she acts like she's a robot, for the most part. It is one of worst performances I have ever seen.Now for the good. Again, the first hour is ""character driven"" and has some inside (exaggerated a bit or not) on the ""Art market"" that are really great and fun to watch. Besides that, Jake, at the very least a super talented actor, just transforms himself and gives an amazing performance.But his acting goes over the top on the second ""horror"" part of the movie, which disappoints at every level. The character stuff isn't resolved and the horror is weak and not particularly well filmed, except for one scene with Gyllenhaal.In the end, middle of the pack.",Velvet Buzzsaw
39,aciessi,A Snobby Lack of Effort.,1,4 March 2019,"I'm not going to mince words. Velvet Buzzsaw is garbage. Garbage, being the last thing I'd expect to come from Dan Gilroy, the writer and director of Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler was an intimate, frightening and astounding first feature from Gilroy. Those who have seen it won't forget seeing life through the POV of a scummy independent journalist who preys on death and tragedy for a promotion. It told a gruesome story that interweaves with a larger message of the mainstream media's capital on violent crime. This time, he gives us a murder-mystery within the pretentious LA art scene. Sardonic enough to work. You'd have every right to feel excited as you begin watching it. 40 minutes in, and I'm just bored to tears. I'm aggravated. The characters are drab, dull caricatures of current and has-been modern artists. We're supposed to find it funny that these people are empty vessels who spew out big words to critique the art they look at and themselves. Artists aren't all like this. Some are wild, some are creepy, some are annoying and yes, some aren't much fun to be around at all. Give us some satire to work with. The supernatural twist of the film is cockeyed at best. I appreciate trying to work a film around the message of the loss of meaning in art and the rise of commercialized artists. There's a story to be had there. This isn't the one.",Velvet Buzzsaw
40,kjproulx,"Ambitious, But Underwhelming",6,1 February 2019,"Ever since the release of Nightcrawler back in 2014, Dan Gilroy is a director that I've wanted to keep a sharp eye on. I'll admit I wasn't a big fan of his film Roman J. Israel Esq., but I was still impressed by his talent, enough to continue watching his future projects. Velvet Buzzsaw is his latest work that he both wrote and directed and while I did enjoy some of it, this director only has one home run in my book, which still remains to be Nightcrawler. Some viewers may find this film to be pretentious and others may find it elegant, which will stir up a great conversation, but I personally found that it fell somewhere in the middle. If you're a fan of a unique premises, you may want to check this one out.There isn't really a main character here, but it could be argued that the central focus of the film is on Jake Gyllenhaal's Morf. After the passing of an elderly man, his paintings are discovered and put on display for all to see. To their surprise, these paintings have minds of their own and they begin to seek revenge against those who study them in the wrong ways. Personally, the concept of this film intrigued me upon first glance, but after watching the film unfold, it felt like more of a way of finding viewers for the movie as a whole. The bizarre turn this film takes didn't feel earned by the time the film concludes. With a strong first act and a weird second act, this movie lost all potential throughout the third.I must admit that this is one of the better assembled casts I've seen in a long time. From powerhouses like Jake Gyllenhaal and Toni Collette to the always outstanding performances given by both John Malkovich and Rene Russo, down to stellar newcomers like Natalia Dyer and Daveed Diggs, I found myself engaged no matter what was happening throughout an uninteresting scene, due to the fact that they're clearly all devoted. If for nothing else, this cast believed they were making something terrific and it really shows in each and every one of their performances.Sadly, as I mentioned, this film as a very weak third act that went in many ways that felt easy for the movie to go. Aside from some very cool visuals and great cinematography throughout the entire film, the story, in retrospect, kind of went nowhere. I could see where director Dan Gilroy was trying to go and the final scene of the film definitely showcases an interesting future for the story, but I wasn't engaged in the story enough to care all that much. The characters invested me from the very beginning and the twist pulled me in even more, but the movie unravels in a way that frankly bored me.In the end, Velvet Buzzsaw is an ambitious film in terms of the notions that it tries to explore and wow its audience with, but I was underwhelmed by it as a whole. I definitely commend the technical aspects of it and the set-up was very well done, so I can recommend it to film buffs, but I truly don't believe this film will find a home outside of that circle. I could be wrong, but I feel this movie is for a very niche audience. Velvet Buzzsaw is an impressively ambitious film that feels a little wasted by the end.",Velvet Buzzsaw

42,AhmedSpielberg99,"Velvet Buzzsaw is the first 2019 movie I watch, and it's likely to be on my top 10 disappointing movies of 2019 at the end of the year!",4,2 February 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is thought-provoking, but not in a good way. My mind couldn't stop thinking throughout its 113 minute runtime; only to make sure if I'm really getting all what is going on, or the plot is so profound and smart that I'm only seeing the surface of it. The dialogue sounded very sophisticated, and everything was very stylish. Alas, the movie is utterly pretentious, and isn't half intelligent as it tries to be. The movie just liked to overstylize while it tried to distract you from its overly-expository dialogue, and its incoherent plot. But this is just the tip of the iceberg!Only five minutes through the movie, I could tell that Velvet Buzzsaw is nothing but a typical Netflix movie; not like Roma, but much more like Mute. The production design, for instance, is surprisingly cheap and poor (considering the movie is about Art) that made the movie looks more like an episode of a TV-Series than an actual movie. There are some stunning colorful shots, though. Thanks in large part to the cinematographer Robert Elswit (There Will Be Blood).In the first 10 minutes we are introduced to many characters on after another who I wish if I cared about any of them. Aside from Josephina, played by Zawe Ashton, I was hardly invested in any of the characters. The stellar cast is not to blame of course; Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, and Toni Collette, they really did their best. What's worse than the overabundance of characters, whom I didn't care about, is that almost half of them are pretty much needless and don't have much to add to the story.Dan Gilroy's use of foreshadowing is as unsubtle as it gets. I mean he abruptly quite literally focuses on particular things that would have a major role in the plot later on. Some of the images Gilroy throws right in your face are just for a satirical purpose. By the way, Velvet Buzzsaw falls completely flat as a satirical movie, If you haven't already expected that. Its satire is blatantly toothless and blunt.The way Gilroy moves between the characters is quite impressive. It's slick, and also make you feel as if all the characters are suspicious, and always keep an eye on each other.As a horror film, Velvet Buzzsaw doesn't have many horror elements, except some ""scary"" scenes and jumpscares scattered throughout the second half that are as laughably cheap as those you see in trashy dumb slasher horror flicks. As a result, the movie has a painfully inconsistent tone.I would be lying if I said that I wasn't interested at some point in the story, and wanted to know what would happen. Nevertheless, that was only for about 10 minutes in the second act, and then the movie lost me again pretty quick.I can't express how frustrated and underwhelmed I am, especially when the movie marks the second collaboration between one of my all-time favorite actors Jake Gyllenhaal and the talented filmmaker Dan Gilroy, after the first movie they made together, Nightcrawler, which is one of my all-time favorites, and one of the few movies I gave them the perfect score. It's not the first time though for Gilroy to disappoint me, for he did back in 2017 with his mediocre film, Roman J. Israel, Esq.Low your expectations, because Velvet Buzzsaw is yet another Netflix movie.(4/10)",Velvet Buzzsaw

Take the whole 'Mona Lisa eyes moving' thing and stretch into an almost 2 hour film - complete with the most pretentious dialogue you'll hear since that mature age student piped up to have their say in your University lecture last semester. Imagine a bad pilot episode for a failed HBO show, or some straight-to-video B-grade horror film.I really love Jake Gyllenhaal. I really love Toni Collette. I really love Zawe Ashton after seeing her in 'Fresh Meat'. But damn, this film just didn't do it for me, despite the incredibly strong Gyllenhaal performance - who is hilariously gleefully camp at every opportunity. It's more of a mess than half the so-called art they're try to sell-off. I kept waiting for some backbone to appear, but it all just seemed too disposable.John Malkovich was also incredibly under-utilised. The world in which this film is set was more irritating than someone running their nails down a blackboard. Despite its slow-moving pace, I did have a couple of laughs (including a particular death scene). The last half hour went crazy and somehow sucked me in.Some viewers may love the dark humour in this, or find that watching it makes them somehow feel edgy. I'm betting most reviews will probably just talk about Jake Gyllenhaal's ass or the naughtiest monkeys they've seen since the farting chimpanzee in Ed.For me, I'm just disappointed at what could've been a really special and impressive film.

52,apryla-58795,No death no art,10,2 February 2019,"""What's the point of art if nobody sees it?""Wow! Just wow! I've got a lot of comments on this one. I'm really glad I didn't take the reviews on this to heart and decided to judge for myself. I've seen a lot of movies and hardly anything anymore moves me but this was a rare treat. I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it. It felt fresh and original. I love horror films and I can't recall a horror film dealing with art in this manner so kudos to the writer Dan Gilroy on this one.I am not an art critic and I don't know much about the art world or art in general. I think most of it is pretentious and I don't understand a lot of what many art shows are about. I know it's basic but my idea of good art is something that touches me that I find in Marshall's or T.J. Maxx. I don't really have any expertise on whether people in the art world are portrayed correctly in this or not. I will say though that when the art world started revering stuff like Mapplethorpe I feel THAT is when true art kind of went off the rails and now I'm not sure if anyone has an idea of what true art is or not. It's all become subjective. The one scene where Tom Sturridge visits John Malkovich in his studio portrays this perfectly. Malkovich has a pile of trash bags on the floor and TS thinks it's art and is looking at it in all seriousness. I mean really?If someone wants to express themselves through ""art"" then good for them if they can find an audience but I have to wonder if some of the art through the years has not been truly art but more of a statement to try to show how pretentious the rich are - to make fools of them in proving that they will buy anything. The problem is how do we know anymore what is truly art and what is strictly a vehicle for making money. Since that line has become blurred along the way I don't know if it's possible to be able to know if an artist's renderings are truly personal or not. If something is born out of a truly creative spirit then that should be considered but just taping together a bunch of junk mail and charging people to look at something they themselves could make at home well then that's where it's not art anymore. Art used to mean strictly paintings or drawings but it has been expanded to mean anything an artist wants to do which means someone throwing trash bags down on the ground could be interpreted as art and the person who did that gets revered as some kind of genius and that takes no thought.But I digress...This movie pokes fun at the art world's pretentions and how art has become about money and not really the appreciation of an individual's creative talent and art for art's sake.I think some people are rating this low because it is advertised as a horror film and in one way it is but mostly it's not. If you take it for what it is I believe more people would appreciate it than those who go into it thinking they're going to be terrified.I find it hard to believe that not many people understand the movie or understand the ending. IMHO it made perfect sense and I'm not somebody who considers myself to be that intelligent or know that much about films. I just watch a lot of movies and it seemed very clear what this movie was about.Basically it was about a bunch of people in the art world and their greediness. Morf Vandewalt (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a shallow and dismissive art critic whose reviews make or break artist's careers.Rhodora Haze (played by Rene Russo) runs an art gallery. She used to be in a band way back in the day but decided to branch out into art which became her occupation. It is through this transition that she has become very greedy, cutthroat and lacking in moral character.Josephina (played by Zawe Ashton) is one of her employees who has ambitions to move up in the art world and make a name for herself but her personal issues cause Rhodora to not trust her commitment. One day Rhodora tells Josephina that she cannot work with clients anymore until she proves herself worthy of that position. This makes Josephina upset and seemingly desperate to redeem herself.One day as she's on her way out of her apartment building Josephina sees a cane on the ground. She looks up and notices part of an arm hanging off the floor above her. She goes up to investigate and discovers that there is a man lying on the floor dead. After they call 911 it shows Josephina getting her mail. There is a man there who appears to work for the apartment complex. He is removing the dead guy's name from his mailbox. He starts chatting up Josephina and basically tells her that the dead man had strict instructions to destroy everything in his apartment upon his passing. After this exchange Josefina heads back to her apartment. On her way up she notices the dead man's apartment door and decides to go inside. Upon entry she discovers thousands of pieces of disturbing artwork that appear to belong to the dead man. As Josephina walks through the apartment we begin to see the wheels turning in her head. She takes the paintings and then hatches the idea to pass these off as her own discovery. She begins to tell people that she is the representative of this artwork.Rhodora comes to Josephina's apartment and forces her way in. She starts looking at the paintings and she basically threatens Josephina by reminding her of her noncompete clause. Rhodora basically says she'll ruin Josephina if she tries to go ahead with her plan to pass these paintings off as her find. Josephina is reluctant but she knows Rhodora has her over a barrel and thus she has no choice but to enter into a shady partnership together.Rhodora starts generating buzz about the paintings after they discover that the artist is Vetril Dease. No one seems to know who this artist is but soon enough they are landing clients due to the approach they take in selling the paintings. They make them appear to be rare and in short order the money starts rolling in.In fact the paintings are not in short supply as there were about 1000 in Dease's apartment. Rhodora decides to hide that fact from the public and orders her assistant Bryson (played by Billy Magnusson) to take a majority of the paintings to storage. She plans on utilizing them in the future to make more money once they get past the initial demand for the paintings.On the way to the storage facility Bryson stops off to inspect what's in the crates. Upon seeing Dease's artwork Bryson decides to steal a few pieces for himself. After he gets back in his truck and sets off for the storage facility he lights a cigarette and one of the sparks lands on his T-shirt and engulfs him in flames. He is able to get the fire out but when he looks in his rearview mirror he sees an apparition of Vetril Dease himself which makes him crash into a abandoned autobody shop. He is able to get out of the truck and make his way inside the shop. He finds a sink where he starts to splash cold water on his burns. There is a painting on the wall above the sink of monkeys who are working on a truck. As Bryson is splashing water on his burns you see the monkeys start to move. They come off the truck in the painting and next we see their actual arms reaching out and grabbing Bryson and pulling him into the painting.Thus starts off a series of deaths relating to Vetril Dease's artwork.Dan Gilroy should win an award just for the sheer fact that he somehow got John Malkovich to act against type. His performance was very understated. His last scene on the beach was everything. Just taking sheer joy in his art like a child would even though it would wash away was a very touching last moment to show. At his core he hadn't lost his soul to the almighty dollar.Natalia Dyer (who portrays Coco-a lowly young employee of Rhodora's who also has ambitions of her own to move up in the art world but isn't taken seriously) impressed me in this. When I was first introduced to her through Stranger Things there was something very offputting about her. She was thin to the point of distraction but in this she looks like she has gained some weight so I was able to focus on her acting rather than wondering why she was so thin. Her acting is very understated-she isn't flashy or showy. She acts very realistically. One other reviewer said she was the only ""good"" (moral) one in this but I had a different takeaway. She was just as ""bad"" as the others but her fault wasn't with being greedy for the art. She went behind her employer's back and told confidential information to a competing gallery. She didn't even know these people but she confided in them like you would a friend strictly so she could get a job. She may not have done anything to get the art like the others but she was willing to double cross people to get ahead with regards to position. Those actions have consequences and her lack of loyalty (although understandably so) bit her in the butt when she ended up with no job and had to go back home.I know Hollywood is trying to make Daveed Diggs happen because of Hamilton but whatever talent he has on stage does not transfer to the big screen. He is very bland and mostly just stands around with his mouth open. He brings scenes down when he's in them. The best thing about him in this is his cornrows.I like Toni Collette and she was pretty good in this but her part was short. Maybe it was because she looked so drastically different but her part could have been played by anyone. She was kind of forgettable which is usually not the case with her roles.All the actors did a good job but I feel like all I'll remember about this is Vetril Dease, his art and the mystery surrounding him. The art is the focus and the actors are just tertiary characters.I can't believe this was put out by Netflix. Their originals have been embarrassing and while this doesn't completely redeem them it sure won them a few points with me.",Velvet Buzzsaw
53,jwwalrath-227-85487,"Interesting, but could have been more compact",7,3 February 2019,"Netflix original Velvet Buzzsaw is an interesting combination of a supernatural horror movie and a biting critique of the business side of the art world. In it, an employee of an art studio finds out her recently deceased neighbor had tons of paintings in his apartment. There's a lot of publicity in an unknown artist who only becomes famous after death and the studio starts selling his work. Soon terrible fates fall upon those involved. Overall, I found this to be an interesting film that could've been better if the run time was cut down a bit.I've got no complaints on the horror aspect. The deadly curse mostly operates through works of art. There are some of the most visually impressive and creative deaths I have seen in a while. The background of the artist, though maybe not the most original backstory, also manages.The art world side however is hit and miss. The unscrupulous side of the business is interesting and at times the script and dialogue work. However, other parts are rather dry and at times dull. The film is longer and has more cast members than needed.Director/writer Dan Gilroy, who also did Nightcrawler, has a pretty good sense of style, especially the aforementioned killings. The movie even has the dying breed that is the opening credits sequence. However, some parts don't quite work. In fairness, I think the film may have been hampered by the budget a little. (I think the brunt of the money went into getting Jake Gyllenhaal, Renee Russo, Toni Colette, and John Malkovich.) The lighting is lifeless and there is a a segue involving a champagne glass that seems unnecessary and poorly edited and rendered.Good cast. Gylenhaal, the lead, proves he has versatility by doing a swell job as a cynical, effete art critic.I feel the choice of recommending this or not is difficult. This movie's mixing of genres makes it a rather subjective affair.",Velvet Buzzsaw
54,andrewroy-04316,"It has one basic idea, and there's nothing interesting or even present beyond that",3,23 June 2020,"I knew people didn't like Velvet Buzzsaw, and I have put off seeing it for a year and a half, but still thought it'd at least be more interesting than it was with the Gilroy/Gyllenhaal pair. It's decent enough in playing up the pretentious, ridiculous art world, though it could not have been more heavy handed. It has some funny moments and the great cast at least gives some okay characters, but nothing ever gets off the ground. I hate to make this comparison, but it kinda feels like Yesterday to me: movies with very interesting and original premises which never engage with or develop it at all. Not a single substantive idea was presented in the second half of the film; it was just one meaningless death after another. Sure, it's a take on the commercialization of art and how people only care about money, but it's just so shallowly written that you're immediately bored. The events of the film don't make any sense, but even if Gilroy is trying to tell a symbolic story where maybe it doesn't make sense in a rigid real world setting but has some interesting message, he fell flat on his face. It doesn't have anything to say other than extremely obvious and quickly tired jabs at the high-class art world. I kept hoping something would happen and the events would either make sense or be put in some sort of thematic context, but the credits rolled leaving me very dissatisfied. I really wanted to like this one and was hoping it'd be a Serenity-like movie that I trust the talent making the film and think is great and interpret differently than others, but the audience was right about this one. Not worth the watch.",Velvet Buzzsaw

58,PyroSikTh,Failed as a Horror. Failed as a Comedy. Failed as a Drama,6,17 February 2019,"For the first half an hour or so of Velvet Buzzsaw we're introduced to our motley crew of art dealers and critics. Almost all of them are insufferable. Morph is a critic who's as critical as critics are. He talks eloquently and almost never uses the same descriptive twice, but always harbours an air of superiority, and where he puts his opinion has consequences for all involved. Josephina is a secretary with ambitions, who takes the word of one of her friends over the phone that her boyfriend is cheating on her, assuming it must all be true (we never meet this friend, nor the boyfriend, so never figure out whether the friend was trustworthy or manipulative). Her and Morph end up having a fling, cheating on their respective partners, and become engaged in an enthralling love affair (until Josephina cheats on him. Maybe the problem wasn't that first boyfriend all along). Rhodora owns the most prestigious art dealership in LA, after having grown bored of her own artistic endeavours in a punk band in the 70s, covering her tattoos of the time in shame and embarrassment. Gretchen works at a local art museum as a curator, before leaving to work for wealthy clients curating their personal art collections. Then there's Jon Dondon; a South African rival to Rhodora, Piers; an artist who's struggling with artistic block, Bryson; a general handyman with a passing curiousity in art and all its forms, and Coco; a young, optimistic intern who jumps from employer to employer.Okay, the fact that was a lengthy paragraph means the character development was perfectly fine, as hard to sympathise with these characters as it was. The biggest hurdle at this point is that we just meander around these character's vapid lives for the first third of the movie. There's no drive, there's no urgency, and as well developed as they are, I just honestly didn't care for what any of them were getting up to personally or professionally.It's not until Josephina's neighbour drops dead that the plot actually starts to kick in, leaving behind his own art, with strict orders for it to all be destroyed. When Josephina discovers this art, she takes it upon herself to sell it off for insane profits and make everyone she knows very, very wealthy indeed. While the pieces themselves obviously hold some mystical entrancements that whisps people up in them, she doesn't really care about them. This becomes readily apparent when people start pointing out how they move, and despite displaying a few on her own walls, she never notices, much to her own annoyance as everyone around her appears to go mad.This is where the entire concept and theme of the movie comes in. Art is personal. Art is expressive. Artists put their blood, sweat, and tears into their art for themselves (quite literally in Dease's case). Art isn't made to be sold and profited from. In a way the entire movie is critical of the art world and how it values money and critical reviews over the actual art itself (something that could easily be applied to other artistic industries like music and film). Dease's spirit haunts the paintings, and he takes his vengeance out on everyone and anyone who seeks to profit off his works, because that's not what they were made for. Our eccentric cast of characters start to drop like flies as they exploit and emotionally mistreat each piece.But what really hammers this home is the character of Piers. He bought a new studio in the middle of the city, with the lower level replicating his own works to sell off, while the upper level houses a single piece of work and half a basketball court. He's hit a wall because he stopped making art for himself. Halfway through the movie he's sent off to a secluded beach-house to clear his mind and get back into the swing of things, and he is never seen again until the credits. He's on the beach carving out his own expressions in the sand as it washes away into the ocean. He's found peace and perfect artistic expression; for himself that no-one else will see. Josephina in her blind ambition remarks ""What's the point in art if no-one will see it?"" And this scene at the end with Piers answers that brilliantly.So it's not like this a complete trainwreck. The basic idea is golden, the idea of weaving this theme into haunted paintings that kill off the opportunistic is also golden. The problem lies in the execution. As I said we spend far too long toiling around with unlikeable characters and their uninteresting lives. Once the plot kicks in, it still doesn't quite meet its potential. Its scares are almost non-existent, with each and every death occurring off-screen. The creepiest the movie gets is when one character finds himself trapped in his own exhibit full of creepy dolls and a projector, and yet the build-up is far scarier than the off-screen pay-off. Another character gets their arm minced off and are left on the floor to bleed to death.Meanwhile the film also attempts to weave in some comedy and satire. The problem here is it's too few and far between, often making the odd moments it succeeds feel like they're part of a different movie. Jon Dondon admiring a pile of rubbish on the floor, Morph critiquing someone's choice of casket, and a gruesome death mistaken by schoolchildren as part of exhibit are great displays of where this satire could have gone. Instead that was the end of list, and none of them earn the laughs they should've done because they feel so detached from the rest of the movie.So it fails as a horror movie, it fails as a comedy, and it also fails as a drama. As I've said, I didn't care one bit for these characters and their personal lives. All of them were far too despicable to be curious of. Gyllenhaal does do a fantastic job with Morph, I'll grant him that, offering us the closest we get to a protagonist who is slightly more likeable than the rest, but the movie wants to tell too much drama without the time nor the place to tell it. We rush through days and weeks with the blink of an eye (Morph and Josephina's relationship is a great example of this; starting separated, having a fling, evolves into a full relationship, and then breaks apart again). The sub-plot of Damrish is deadweight, and as poignant as it was, Piers didn't really fit into the plot at all beyond his personification of the movie's themes.Velvet Buzzsaw had a fair amount of potential. The castlist was pretty great, but only really Gyllenhaal delivered, and the same crew that gave us Nightcrawler returned, the themes were all there and worth talking about (and could've gone super meta), and the characters were fully fleshed out despite how much I despised them all. Unfortunately it wasn't scary enough to be a horror movie, wasn't funny enough to be a satirical comedy, and wasn't interesting enough to be a drama, and all three elements detracted from each other. It's another film that needed trimming down in the script to remove all the deadweight and just focus on what was important and what worked. I give Velvet Buzzsaw an okay 6/10.",Velvet Buzzsaw

This film delves deep into the psyche of an artist. An artist is naive and creates his art to Express and not to impress but slowly as he / she is consumed by the commercial aspect of art , they start to limit their creativity to please certain foolish people. This film is horrifying.

A relatively short one at just under 1 hour 50 it manages to put a lot to the audience and develop a grand conspiracy which is actually quite interesting. Sadly a lot of it is glossed over completely after an initial introduction but it still manages to function as a film.

It's not funny enough to be a comedy, not sufficiently scary to be a horror movie, and we don't know enough about the characters (and I'm using that word very generously) for it to be an engaging drama.

67,WalkdenEntertainment,Murder By Art...,5,24 March 2019,"Mort Vandewalt (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an art reviewer and critic. Visiting expos and art exhibits for a living, Mort has no problems calling it what it is and then writing about it through online blogs or his next novel.Mort soon becomes rather curious when one of the art exhibitors he works with discovers a series of incredible (but also unusual) paintings done by an artist that no one has ever heard of. He will soon discover that the paintings carry a supernatural curse that seeks revenge and death on those who have wished to make money from these paintings.Velvet Buzzsaw may come across as a horror film on paper but it actually feels more like an Art House film meets Final Destination. The film tends to focus on the people who work in the business side of the art industry and not so much on the artists themselves. It's an interesting idea and I was rather curious, but unfortunately this film is loaded with characters who are challenging to enjoy on screen. As you would expect, actor Jake Gyllenhall steals the screen whenever he appears, but the downside here is that the film is loaded with many other charaters who are greedy and selfish, and get plenty of screen time. As I sat during the film's duration, at times I questioned if actor Jake Gyllenhaal would have more screen time, or worse, sometimes I forgot he was actually in the film until he reappeared again. Being the strongest actor in this film, it's a disappointment whenever the film chooses to focus on another characters for a lengthy duration.As a plot, we do have something different but its theme is nevertheless something we have seen before. A curse who selects to take out horrible and silly characters reminded me so much of Final Destination. Certain side characters are here only to provide a death scene or for us to watch them fight for their lives. I mention Final Destination as an example because when you know what's coming to a certain character, the film likes to give a scene that goes on as long as possible in which the viewer keeps questioning how someone will die or what the cause of death will be. It's scenes like these that actually hurt the film as I felt they all dragged way too long. Each death scene basically plays out the same way each time. Also, when I started watching the the film, I thought to myself... if this is a horror film, I bet that person dies first.... and sadly I was correct.As far as Visual and Sound Design, Netflix has once again delivered a film that will proudy show off your audio equipment and I must compliment the film's use of the centre channel for the actor's dialogue.Overall, Velvet Buzzsaw delivers a great idea to the screen but the themes are something we've seen previously. Actor Jake Gyllenhall gives an outstanding peformacne (no surprise) but the film suffers when he is away from the screen for a lengthy duration. We also have a number of side characters who are greedy and selfish and I found it hard to really enjoy the side characters given the screen time they all get. Death sequences are also dragged out even when you know the final outcome. The film's ending will also leave the audiences with questions as certain elements within the plot just don't add up. It's saddens me to say it, but this film is not a priceless work of art when it comes to cinema.5.5/10

I love how he does movies with big metaphorical messages i.e. Velvet Buzzsaw, Enemy, Nightcrawler, just to name a few.Velvet Buzzsaw is a film that shows us that even art itself is exploited everyday for personal gain, and all of the other hundreds of wrong reasons. Objectively, art can be looked at in many different ways, but subjectively, when it comes down to it subjectively, no one can tell you if you like a piece of art or not, and that's the message of the film along with many others.Great acting from Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Toni Collette, and the rest of the cast.

70,noahgibbobaker,Kinda stupid,4,27 September 2020,"Velvet Buzzsaw tries so hard to make a statement about art that many films have already addressed in more detail. The holy mountain made the same point that Velvet Buzzsaw makes, in more detail, in a single scene.Half of the movie is about the superficial world of mainstream art and the people who make a living from it, at times I genuinely got some enjoyment out of these scenes and I like what Gilroy has to say about art, it's just not presented particularly well. The opening with Jake Gyllenhaal's character is pretty decent. The other half is the cheesiest paranormal activity bad you will ever see, it's never even explained why whatever is happening is happening.In my opinion the biggest issue with this film is the screenplay. Nothing that happens has any explanation whatsoever and we are just meant to go along with it like we understand this complex sequence of events that we haven't heard about until this point. The dialogue is also bad, it's so hard to take anything that is said seriously, especially during the ""scary"" scenes. When a film like this takes itself as seriously as Velvet Buzzsaw does I can't help but laugh.Along with the script being awful so is the acting. I think if Jake Gyllenhaal's performance isn't good there is something fundamentally wrong with your movie. Toni Collette was probably the best actor but she wasn't very good either. Zawe Ashton's performance was by far the worst, she was unintentionally hilarious in every scene she was in, Natalia Dyer and Rene Russo were also terrible.Don't see this one, there are plenty of movies that successfully do what Velvet Buzzsaw wants to do so badly.",Velvet Buzzsaw

72,Hallelujah289,Horrifying but lacking purpose,7,6 February 2019,"Well-made film, gorgeous costumes and set designs. Very believably acted. Interesting to bring horror to the art world elite. Have never quite seen this cast of characters in the genre before: art buyers, art critics, artists, secretaries, and then the one murderous art spirit thrown in to cause a lot of death and carnage.Very original set up, however as a horror film there is a lack of motivation to the deaths, and there isn't the resolution one would hope at the end. The menacing spirit here is unstoppable. I as a viewer like some kind of comeuppance and that isn't truly available as an option here which makes the film seem rather lacking in purpose. Why do these people have to die? Why does the art spirit Dease want to kill them? Do they deserve it? Beyond their different kinds of manipulation of each other and guilt I didn't quite find enough to hate these characters with to like it when they died. I believe the filmmakers tried to supply reason with various references but it never quite clicked. The art elite are pompous and shady people but about average in the scheme of things.If you have a grudge against art elite people and wouldn't mind seeing them get theirs, this film could satisfy that kind of revenge seeking. If you just want to be scared, this film offers that. However if you are interested in a tale of restitution of horrible things put right, this tale doesn't quite satisfy. The crime isn't that bad and the punishment isn't quite resolved either. I can recommend Stephen King's ""Thinner"" for a more satisfying balance between crime and punishment.Bonus points for casting Rene Russo from art thriller ""The Thomas Crown Affair.""",Velvet Buzzsaw

Jake Gyllenhaal starring in what promises to be a drama/mystery instantly peaked my interest, and I scurried over to reddit to check out the trailer. I was fortunate to notice the top comment warning viewers not to watch past the 1 minute mark if they want to avoid spoilers. In retrospect, I wish I had seen the full trailer because I would have at least seen the cheese fest coming. Velvet Buzzsaw builds its characters well and maintains an intriguing plot only to rip it all to shreds with frankly cringey final destination-esque scenes.

74,Gresh854,It's...Different?,5,5 February 2019,"Ummmm...Velvet Buzzsaw is...something? Within this screwball of a horror/satire curio, the unorthodoxly juicy premise and the stupendously elite cast manages to jostle over most of the film's disadvantaged story elements.It's congenial to notice that Dan Gilroy is trying out all sorts of genres within the confines of his writing and directing. Taking on a radiant approach to the splishes and splashes of a retaliating formula, he enables himself to encompass an artifact divergent to anything else. Gilroy also, regulates a zany script about the utmost stereoptpyed high-class ""artists"" and ""critics"" that act as if they are in a theatrical Shakespearean drama throughout their every day lives-which I found to be a rewarding creative decision.Where Velvet Buzzsaw undeniably melts however, is in its anguish of harmonizing its mashing genres, the clashing of way too many rudimentary character-based affairs, and it's lack to persuade a yearning for justification. The film tries to juggle themes of greed, self-obsession, and noxious compulsions through elucidation or scares but, never knows how to fetch them out within in an absorbing or unrepeatable occupancy. The movie critically, just marches over one kill after the other-each accommodating guilty, amplified dementias assembled for the horror-fanatics to devour-while offering no incorporations to the presented story's progress.Velvet Buzzsaw somehow arises to be unthinkably original yet, ferociously predictable in its catastrophically mundane results. However, at first glance, I was going to permit this movie with a much lower score but, with some thought and time emplaced, I kind of now, idolize the heck out of how culty and extraterrestrial this commodity turned out to be. Paint it as what you want, it's still ""art"", nonetheless. Very, very conflicting art. Voilà! (Verdict: C+)",Velvet Buzzsaw

The cast aren't likeable, and the bumbling slow script pandering to artists is barely tolerable.I was genuinely excited upon release to see this; having devoted the time, I regret the decision wholeheartedly.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Netflix movie that will make you bite your tongue sometimes of how harsh it can be but also maybe disappoint you at times how dark and terrifying it could have been.
Following Morf (Jake Gyllenhaal) on his journey of criticising art in way that many wouldn't know how to look even it is all destined to go down. In the world filled with money, opportunities, twist, greed and desire to be the success we are presented with couple of lives that will go south and never return from there. Velvet Buzzsaw perfectly describes movie from the start to the end, but in a good way because of how things will unfold and how everybody is vulnerable in the storm of something darker and much bigger. Still there are moments that will leave you wandering for answers and clues as you have no idea of how things got to be and unnecessary scenes that could have been used for something more important as expanding the plot.
Directing of movie is absolutely art-crafted, word-less and truly amazing. There are shots that will leave you speechless and stunned how amazing they look and how they present scene. Also worth mentioning is how twisty and tricky movie gets and moving towards the end you start to feel even more agitated of what will happen. Considering it to be horror movie there are some gore and dark moments that will everybody appreciate but and there is a but it could have been even more terrifying and compete to great horror movies, instead it relies on thriller moments which feel too much.
Not to say it's a bad movie, it is not, it is very interesting one worth investing you time to see in because there is something new presented in it and will leave you amazed. Dark, gore and twisty are best three words to describe it.

78,scb_coldsteel,"A unique satire on the art community that is ultimately a toothless, but entertaining B film.",6,3 February 2019,"So I saw Velvet Buzzsaw on Netflix. Honestly I was really looking forward to this movie. I'm a huge Jake Gyllenhaal fan and I was very impressed with Nightcrawler when he and the director last worked together. Plus that is just a great name for a movie. Overall this was a strange and unique film that certainly had its moments, but ultimately was a bit of a silly mess.The central plot of the movie is all over the place. Initially the film acts as a slice of life depiction of the fickleness of the art community. Slowly a hodgepodge of bohemian characters from the art world are introduced and become obsessed with the work of a recently deceased artists. The film gradually evolves into surreal mystery horror where the art comes to life violently murdering people. All the while the film also heavily relies on dark humor to act as a satire on the art industry and the commodification of art for monetary gain.The film very much had its fun moments. I certainly found myself laughing at the tongue-in-cheek nature of the satirical look at the art community. Half of the film is preoccupied with introducing the audience to the art world and just how shallow, vapid, and money hungry the institution really is. Of course after introducing all these characters and pointing out why we shouldn't like them the other half is occupied with murdering them. It's a fun formula at times, but not exactly ground breaking particularly since the horror elements are uninspired.I will say the movie was quite unique. It combined elements of social commentary, horror, mystery, and black comedy together to create a satirical look at the art community while combining slasher like elements from B movies. I was entertained half the time purely by the oddness of the film. On top of that the movie had an interesting color pallet that was quite aesthetically pleasing. Even though the execution was lacking you can't say Velvet Buzzsaw wasn't something unique.The movie had a large and talented cast that certainly did its job. Jake Gyllenhaal was great as expected. He did a good job with his character and as always made for a memorable performance. His neurotic and snobbish depiction of an art critic is easily enough reason to watch the movie alone. Plus I'm always happy to see Toni Collette on a role.Speaking of characters the film may have had too many. There were a few like John Malkovich's character that could have been ommited. In the same regard their were also other story arcs that could have been trimmed down like the competing art dealer. The script really could have used some work. It just seemed to ramble on quite a bit before picking up steam.The biggest problem with the film was not the story it was telling, but the jumbled narrative it utilized to tell the story. The story jumped from character to character, but I never felt invested in anyone's story. The satirical elements never seemed to really be pushed far enough nor were the horror elements pushed far enough. The movie was never as smart as it wanted to be or as terrifying. The horror elements were particularly weak throughout most of the film.It seemed like the movie was at a odd halfway point where it simply didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it supposed to be a biting tongue in cheek satire? A dark, but silly slasher b movie? I don't know what it wanted to be, but I know it never worked right in the end. There were just too many moving parts that served no real purpose.Really I expected more considering San Gilroy's past work. This movie has a strong message, but it's a jumbled mess that can't seem to find its own voice. The social commentary and satire was just toothless most of the time and the gore was lacking. It wasn't a bad movie, but I wouldn't call it a good one either. If you can embrace the pure silliness of the film and not expect too much it's not a bad ride. A 6.25 out of 10.",Velvet Buzzsaw

81,hunter-friesen,A Joyously Absurd Slasher,6,8 February 2019,"The art world can be a cutthroat business, or in the case of the film ""Velvet Buzzsaw"", the art world is a business that can literally cut your throat.After a reclusive old man suddenly dies in her apartment building, art assistant Josephina unethically stumbles onto the man's life work: hundreds of eerie paintings depicting acts of unsettling violence. Seeing this as a golden opportunity to rise up the social ladder, Josephina strikes a deal with her boss, Rhodora, to sell the paintings for vast sums of money.Unbeknownst to the buyers and sellers, the old man intended for all his paintings to be destroyed upon his death. With his final wish going unfulfilled, the cursed paintings take a shape of their own and begin to exact revenge on those who wrongfully profit off of them.Directed by Dan Gilroy, ""Velvet Buzzsaw"" works across multiple genres as it pokes fun at the art world through a mix of satirical comedy and grotesque horror. Even though this has been done before in many other films, Gilroy does it differently as he entertainingly contradicts the expectations that come with each genre. Instead of being laugh out loud, the observational comedy amusingly bewilders, and the scares are delivered through a bright color palette as opposed to the conventional dark low lighting.Blending genres does make for some great fun throughout, but from time to time the film suffers from it. Gilroy overplays his hand at a few points, leading to some head-scratching moments where the film can't decide if a scene is supposed to be funny or scary.Shot by veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit, the film also employs some neat camera tricks that keep the story on its toes. Information is steadily given frame by frame as it builds up to a big reveal that flips everything on its head.Both equally ambitious and narrow-minded, Gilroy's script is quite lackluster when compared to his competent directing.Through an ensemble cavalcade of caricatures, the script satirizes the art industry and tries to prove that money and art don't actually go hand in hand.This vision is respectable, but the clunkiness of the story and Gilroy's inability to go outside the box holds it down. The clichéd anthem of ""art is for everyone and greed is holding it back."" quickly becomes an overused gimmick by the time the characters start to get their comeuppance.The sheer size of the cast also spreads the message too thin across the main narrative and several subplots, many of whom are needless filler. While this is a sin on a storytelling level, it is admittingly quite satisfying to watch each character receive a ""Final Destination""-like death.The greatest asset the film boasts is its actors that give life to the crazy characters they inhabit.Reteaming with Gilroy after their fruitful work in ""Nightcrawler"", Jake Gyllenhaal goes all in and is at his campy best as Morf Vandewalt, a renowned critic whose reviews can instantly make or break a career.Also from ""Nightcrawler"", Rene Russo does a great job as Rhodora. She controls each character, and scene, with an iron fist and isn't afraid to get dirty to make a living.Toni Collette and Zawe Ashton are pretty good as Gretchen and Josephina, respectively. They each give credible performances to their extravagantly unlikable characters.Even though they really don't serve a purpose to the story, both John Malkovich and Daveed Diggs do good work as two contradicting artists that get caught up in the bloody mess.It probably wasn't his intention, but Dan Gilroy has made a semi-unoriginal film that tries to make fun of the unoriginal world of high art. However, the unoriginality of the story doesn't diminish from the amusement that it produces. Now available to stream on Netflix, this comedic slasher could be a good way to kill a couple hours, especially when at the low cost of free.",Velvet Buzzsaw

83,MinistryofDoom,"A Great Caricature of the Art World hindered by Sub-par ""Horror""",5,14 May 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is a great art industry movie; it is just not a great horror movie by any means. The actual ""horror"" scenes are so rare in this film that when they actually do happen, you will have no interest but they are so uneventful and by-the-books in terms of horror filmmaking. Yes, if you have seen at least one true horror film in your life, you will be uninspired and unexcited by the routine and mundane ""kill scenes"" which have borrowed from the several horror movies that have come before it. There are no shocks or jump scares because you can see the ""horror"" about to happen. It is always preceded by the routine ominous music, the long shots of dark rooms, and the extended and lingering pauses of the characters about to be killed. The creepiness is so stereo-typically ""creepy"" that it is not creepy but rather, borderline absurd. The film would have been far more interesting had it been about the behind-the-scenes workings of pompous, arrogant and self-absorbed art industry experts. That component of the narrative was much better than the introduction to cursed paintings that seemingly kill the people attached to them. The characters were ridiculous, over-emphasized caricatures of the people that exist within the art world and I loved that. There are very few films, which highlight the ridiculous and obscene inner workings of the art world. I wanted to see more of that; more of egotistical critics, the fame-crazed gallerists, and artists played by an A-list cocktail of very talented actors including Jake Gyllenhaal and Toni Collette who were both fantastic.My verdict is this: You will be pleasantly entertained by the sheer absurdity of the story, and there is no doubt that it will not have been a waste of an hour and a half. However, if your intention is to watch this film for its horror, you will be disappointed because there is not much horror in this film.",Velvet Buzzsaw

The film is consistent of unlikable, shallow characters that are all horrible. This is the first mistake because that means the viewer has no interest in what is happening at all. On top of all, the pace was so slow and only after an hour something started happening, but not gracefully, as it seemed like some weird Insidious version meeting Conjuring but not as good as any. Eventually I had to stop because the horror parts were so boring and I could not care less about what is going on in this movie.",Velvet Buzzsaw
87,Sankari_Suomi,The interpretive dance of cinematic tradition,8,17 February 2019,"Dan Gilroy's ambitions foray into the popular and well established drama/horror/art world satire genre has received mixed reviews (including a frankly bizarre 2.5 on RoberEbert.com) but I personally believe it's one of his best works.Jake Gyllenhaal and Toni Collette are the standout performers. John Malkovich is criminally under used, with no opportunity to show off his full powers. Tom Sturridge deserves credit for his excellent portrayal of an oily, backstabbing Boer.The cinematography is superb, thanks to the genius of Robert Elswit. His long shots are particularly impressive. Colours are bold, brilliant, and almost oppressively strong. Gilroy insisted on a wide gamut colour pallette (which added an extra $2.5 million to the budget) and this decision has been utterly vindicated by the final product.Velvet Buzzsaw aggressively explores the intercourse between postmodernism and late capitalism, while challenging the audience with poignant questions about subjective reality, human identity, and interpretive transactionalism. It is very much a film for our time, but also a film for times that are not ours, and might never be.Gilroy is confrontational (as always) but never gratuitous. He speaks directly to us, yet also through us, and in some cases beyond us. In this sense, it is the story that invites interpretation, rather than the other way around.I rate Velvet Buzzsaw at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a glorious 8/10 on IMDB.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Nothing works for the movie, not even Gyllenhaal (though he seemed to be trying TOO much). The pretentious plot is frustratingly boring.
The moment I saw an ensemble cast, I expected some great character play, but soon I realize that the only reason there are so many characters is so that the writer can kill them off at the end in different ways (and drag the movie).
There is no consistency in terms of plot. I still couldn't understand whether it is a satire on the hollowness of the art world or trying to reinforce that same materialism.
Totally a messed up movie.",Velvet Buzzsaw
89,svhot,"Good, fresh concept in horror genre, great performances, clever direction",8,6 February 2019,"""Velvet Buzzsaw"" is a horror movie that conveys its story to viewers in a satire-style. The title of the movie indicates this itself ; velvet is normally linked to an artist's work. The main lesson this movie is trying to teach is the fact that an artist's work should be respected more because of its creativity and artistic nature. However, majority of the people tend to value an artist's work more because of its monetary / financial value . This is definitely very humiliating and frustrating for artists and this movie shows why this angst exists.Director Dan Gilroy has made an intelligent movie with some outstanding horror scenes and great performances. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal proves once again how spontaneous and versatile he is at doing all types of roles. Give Jake a good role, and he will give you a brilliant performance in return.

92,varun-25071997,Not All Art is Mona Lisa....,8,1 February 2019,"Dan Gilroy's critique of the commercialization of art work mixes satire with spirits and delivers one of the best horror films of our time. This film doesn't play safe with you and doesn't compromise one bit, not even in the shocking third act. The cast of talented workers all deliver very fine performances and Jake Gyllenhaal proves he is capable of impressing us in any given role. Robert Elswit's cinematography is the biggest highlight of the film and it challenges his best work ""There Will Be Blood"". This film shows you how good a film can get if the costumes are delightful.Velvet Buzzsaw tells us about the working of the art world and how different kinds of people profit from selling the art to some bored billionaires. The basic notion Gilroy wants to say is art shouldn't be valued by money and what happens when you don't honor the artist's work. I don't want to reveal the main details of the plot because its better if you see this film knowing very little of it.Its true that sometimes people who are too involved in their work becomes insufferable like Jake Gyllenhaal in this film. With the right amount of gore and thrills, the perfect balance between scream and shock the film's horror scenes work out. Netflix seems to be getting better and better every year even though the wrong movies (ie. Bird Box) grab all the attention. Even though I would have loved to see this in theater, from the commercial point of view releasing in Netflix was the correct decision to grab the attention of a wider audience.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Blindly following the plot, we try to understand the mystery in the air but are only getting eerie vibes and ominous signs of fatal outcome. Peripeteias of art business are interspersed here and there but I didn't follow them, the only thing that mattered was the question: ""What is going to happen"".Although at some point I understood that the scenario is just inexplicable occasion to kill people, I continued enjoying it with eagerness to see some creative ways to dispose from characters.

Seriously, why is Malkovich in this film? What does his character add? And Damrish...the whole subplot about some artist who may switch agencies has NOTHING to do with the plot. Why have the secretary in this film at all, since she keeps changing jobs?
Take an 80-minute slasher film with a decent, if not unoriginal premise (an artist dies and wants his paintings destroyed, but a greedy art agent steals them and tries to make everyone rich), but then add in what seems like HOURS of pretentious art shop conversation among the agents, critics, currators, etc, and you get one slow, boring film.",Velvet Buzzsaw
98,Benslie,A Slow burn but good message,6,3 February 2019,"First of all, the plot is a unique one and sounds interesting on its own but the film decided that no it wasn't. They started to throw in things that didn't need to be in the film. It just started to slow down the film and at certain points made it feel like it halted to a stop. Some of these plot points lead to scenes in the film that could have been taken out and change nothing. This ties in perfectly with my next thing which is the pacing. The film feels slow at the beginning of the film and because of it the last bit of it feels rushed. This is sad because the last fifteen minutes of the film is the most interesting part of it. The rest of the hour and fifty-two-minute movie is just boring and makes you keep checking the clock to see how much longer it is. Now, this would've been fine if the acting in this was able to grab your attention and hold on to and for some of the actors it does but the rest slips. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Morf Vandewalt, was the main person that you followed throughout this film and whenever he was on screen he had your attention. His character had the most development out of all of them, despite it taking a bit to develop. But one thing that did bug me is that he seemed to have been playing the same character that he did in 2014's Nightcrawler. This could be because the same director of Nightcrawler, Dan Gilroy, directed this film. The ending of this film is just weird and ends abruptly with zero conclusion to the story. Finally, the music, composed by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders, is great. Whenever you can hear the music it helps with the tension and makes you think something is going to happen. In the end, this film does have good underlying themes to it and a great Jake Gyllenhaal performance but is a slow burn.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Although the art in question is admittedly gorgeous and the premise seems intriguing, it just doesn't work. It's tedious and boring, neither working as a modern trashy jump scare flick or a more thought provoking atmosphere piece, and you are left running down the clock on this clunker.The music is invasive, often intruding and standing out too much. The cuts are strange, cutting too fast and consequently using way too many cuts. The dialogue is pretty unnatural & feels overly theatrical.Missed as anything but a pointed take down of the art world, and even then it's not great.

113,daryopeek,Basically all horror cliches plus art themes,6,3 February 2019,"Many urban legends and creepy pastas must've a story about a murderous/violent piece of art that bring bad luck whoever in touch with it. This film basically just that, but upscale the characters and setting into some artsy high class flick you can see on Sex and the City. By any means, the setting really sugarcoats what you could expect of a horror film. It brings funny moments, geeky scenes, and little knowledge about what may happens in art (selling) world. However, both of the world can't collide smoothly I suppose due to the horror scenes only dull at its best. I do enjoy the film though, but to acknowledge that this film is good enough to be in my favorite horror watchlist, it needs to be compared to films with similar plot. And by that, I mean The Grudge or Ring have basically the same thing to offer but better in any (horror) way.I would appreciate it more if this film goes really hard on the development of the character, because Josephina, Morf, and Rhodora as the main characters has the potential of it to explore the story/the painter's background more. But the story goes slasher where the blood is needed more, than a story.",Velvet Buzzsaw
114,caramia2002,Art's Evil Seed,3,5 February 2020,"But the film missed it by a mile. Such a high powered, usually great cast, and the director of Nightcrawler, but no. Just no. I am really getting tired of Hollywood's dung factory that all good, new directors with a success get sucked into, and/or they believe their own press. It's too hard to find an even watchable movie these days. I only hope that NF starts pulling a rating into their no-reviews-allowed offerings as I am not always motivated to go hunting down a review.I am thinking that the director was referencing Altman in his satire of a pretentious or entangled world (in this case, the art world/industry) and adding in a bit of Black Swan. But this film is a clumsy parody, an obvious parody, spoonfeeding us with overly pretentious and cartoonish characters and names (with an anagram thrown in, thank goodness, or I would have been really bored!). The horror is not set up well or even at all; I cared for no character enough to be afraid for them or if they became victims. Ho-hum. The art is clumsy and there is not enough background to tie events to paintings and characters and visa versa. Altman didn't mix horror into his satire and Black Swan was too smart to scream parody, for a good reason. Like that kind of parody/satire requires a certain level of reality to work, unless it's heavy comedy, which this isn't.",Velvet Buzzsaw
115,rustonreviews,An interesting disappointment.,5,5 February 2019,"Dan Gilroy made his writer/director debut in 2014 with Nightcrawler, an excellent thriller that dived into the twisted underworld of crime journalism. Both Gyllenhaal and Russo, who starred together in Nightcrawler, reunite with Gilroy for his second feature film, Velvet Buzzsaw, distributed through Netflix. Morf Vandewalt (Gyllenhaal), a pompous art critic who is known for his savage critiques, develops an unusual obsession with a collection of artwork created by Vetril Dease, an unknown artist who is discovered dead by Morf's girlfriend Josephina (Ashton). Josephina introduces the collection to hardened gallery owner Rhodora Haze (Russo), who suggests they exhibit the artwork to the public. As Morf's obsession grows with both the artwork and the once tormented artist himself, he spirals into madness as Dease's art seemingly develops a life of its own, displaying an unexplainable, sinister nature.Gilroy's satirical take on the art world is the films core theme, and his script achieves this rather well. Idly placed garbage bags are mistaken for art (described as ""remarkable"" by a disillusioned youth), as are more disturbing findings throughout the film. Gilroy has a great cast at his disposal, with Toni Collette and John Malkovich also making appearances in supporting roles. Gyllenhaal is great as the pretentious Morf, who critiques just about everything else in his life through the same cynical lens through which he views art. The film does have a couple scenes of merit, but ultimately, Velvet Buzzsaw is a disjointed film that doesn't quite embrace its horror elements as much as it should.The concept itself had me immediately intrigued: artwork retrieved from the dirty, dingy home of a dead artist possesses a murderous consciousness and kills people in cruel yet inventive ways. Coming from the mind from which Nightcrawler was conceived, I was expecting something much more.Unfortunately, Velvet Buzzsaw doesn't quite contain a meaty enough storyline to complement its main idea, and plods along for 2 hours with nothing much of importance happening. It's a slow burn, but what's frustrating about the film is that it doesn't build to anything. Things just happen at random and the various ideas that Gilroy throws at his canvas don't gel together in a meaningful or cohesive way. Even the most interesting plot point is shuffled off to the side lines not too long after it is introduced, and when I reached the half way point, I was longing for a better film that is clearly buried beneath the lacklustre final product.Velvet Buzzsaw may be disappointing, but at least it's an interesting disappointment. When it does decide to embrace its horror elements, it features some effectively gruesome scenes. Trouble is, they're few and far between. With some rewrites and a few scenes cut, Velvet Buzzsaw could have perhaps lived up to it's full potential.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Realizing this may help her career, she takes these bizarre and very dark paintings hoping they have value. And do they! The modern art community is set on fire by dead artist's work and the dealers scramble to profit off his paintings. Things then go very dark from then on. Jake and Renee team up again (Night Crawler) as greedy profiteers in the art community. Don't expect much from John Malkovich in this film.

118,Abranth-d,Killer paintings ? Seriously,5,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Velvet Buzzsaw. When I saw the trailer for this movie , it said "" from the director of nightcrawler"" and that made me look forward to this movie. Did it meet my expectations ? .... Well .... It kind of ish did. So Velvet Buzzsaw stars Jake Gyllenhaal as an arthouse critic and the story is set around the art gallery world in Los Angeles and revolves around killer paintings. As in literally killer , like paintings which kill people ( take away their life ) yes you heard me well , it's a crazy idea which I would consider as something more absurd than Sharknado. But it's not a horror movie but more of a critique on the art world and it's funny how the people in this movie also criticize art . Dan Gilroy's ( the director ) movies always show an insight into the world of jobs mostly set in LA such as the nightcrawlers from Nightcrawler and private lawyers from Roman J esrael and this movie is about the art world , and it was interesting to know about the business and the people and stuff. The "" killer paintings"" however didn't really do it for me . I'm pretty sure the killer paintings had some deeper meaning to them , but this isn't an arthouse movie even though it is set in one and I'm not here to play Easter egg hunts . Also I couldn't help but notice that everyone in this movie owns just apple products , is it cause they're rich people in the art world or is it product placement ? See that's a mystery I can get behind. Not ""why killer paintings kill people""",Velvet Buzzsaw

The character arc that was the most satisfying, most relatable and most empathic was Coco. She kept powering through thick and thin. Despite seeing at ""least"" three dead bodies, she kept doing her job and in the end, she is the one that came out on top.Throughout the film, all the other characters treat her like garbage. Despite this, she still does the best she can and does her job to the highest of quality. She was the one we were supposed to be rooting for and in the end, all is revealed. When she is sitting in that car, that's when Coco has her climactic moment and triumphs over all adversities. She is the last left standing because she was the person who did the right thing. Even if no one thanked her for it.The only problem is, why didn't Dan Gilroy give her more screen time? This is clearly the only good character, and what does he do? He sidelines her.Ladies and gentlemen; the independent, reliable, trustworthy, hardworking, smart and loyal Coco.You go Coco",Velvet Buzzsaw

126,robbotnik2000,A well orchestrated satire on the art world with horror thrown on top,7,13 November 2020,"I ended up liking this more than the average reviewer star-giver, and that is a rare occurrence. The story does not so much center on as hover over various members of an inbred and self-aggrandizing art world, attractive people on the outside, but semi-aware of their corrupt practices of stealing each others' clients and assuring a nice return off their wealthy clients. As attractive and well maintained as it is immoral.
Into this self assured world come the works of an outside artist, apparently deceased, whose work is brilliant (And very reminiscent of the actual artist H.R. Giger, who gave the Alien francise its unique look). It offers what several of our favorite characters believe to be a free ride, major returns from ignorant clients on the work of an artist who can't complain and is safely out of the picture (they think).Our actors form a picturesque ensemble: Rene Russo as the owner of a gallery, Zawe Ashton and Natalie as workers, Toni Collette as an art expert making the move from museum drudge to highly paid consumer representative. Artists played by Daveed Diggs, and John Malkevich; and our main character, Jake Gyllenhaal as an oh-so-precious art reviewer who can make and break your ordinary artist by his mastery of relational high-sounding artistic gibberish.The writing is good. The music and soundtrack selections well placed. I found the movie quite entertaining. The horror theme is somewhat pasted on and not totally seamless with the plot.I think those most critical of the movie might place more importance on the criticisms/ satires of the art world that are part of the movie. Also maybe if they are more serious about their horror. For me, I enjoyed the action, the interplay of relationships and the devolution of people into the horror element.",Velvet Buzzsaw
127,kiowhatta,A tragic ironic misfire,4,4 February 2019,"When I viewed the cast, the credits and especially the premise I was rather intrigued.
The message is simple but completely overstated via the characters.Firstly, the narrative is one of vengeance. The sleek, chic, back-stabbing, L.A art elite happen to stumble upon a haunting and mysterious series of paintings, allegedly produced by a vague and mysterious madman, who, upon his death expressly and without question wanted them destroyed.But the superficial, fame and fortune seeking characters who compulsively stab each other in the back, start to become hypnotised, entranced and captivated by the diabolical now dead artist 'Deese'.Hence the plot is childishly simple: Those who seek to profit from not just expressions of art, but from expressions and manifestations of an artists torment, anguish and madness, are doomed in a karmic (sigh) way to befall a similar fate.Where the movie fails terribly is in the manifestation of the evil in the works of art. The way in which victims behave before they die is like an 80's horror flick telegraphing who's next.
What's worse is the by the numbers jump scares, the ridiculously comical and lazy way in which the character's die, and the whole thing just feels slapped together.
Some fool had the self aggrandising nerve to suggest the characters were deliberately shallow as if the producer worked hard to deliberately create the uppity urbane art scene fools as some kind of reflective ironic message to the viewers. Urgh.

The trailer look nuts. The poster as you can see above is very interesting. Then there was the rest of the cast that featured Rene Russo, Toni Collette, and John Malkovich. It seemed that Netflix has another winner on their hands. The last time we saw a film with Gyllenhaal director by Gilroy was the biting satire Nightcrawler. That film was so well made and tough to sit through. It also featured one if not the best performance from Gyllenhaal I've seen on screen. That film also featured a good performance (and one of the last) from genre icon Bill Paxton (rest in peace). I hyped myself up for Velvet Buzzsaw. And once again I got too hyped too soon.Velvet Buzzsaw is somewhat complicated. The film is about an art dealer (Russo), her employee Josephina (Zawe Ashton), an art critic (Gyllenhaal), a rival dealer Jon Dondon (Tom Sturridge), a work appreciator (Collette) and Coco everyone's assistant (Natalia Dyer). When Josephina comes home one night after a bad day at the office she finds a tenant in her building who has died. She happens to find paintings in the abandoned apartment. She decides to take the initiative, sell the painting, move up in her job and become rich in high art society. What everyone doesn't know about these paintings is that there is something more to them. To anyone trying to profit off them, there are dire consequences.The trailer played this out like a maybe scary, but definitely crazy supernatural horror movie that might be pretty crazy. It is not that...at all. The film is a serious kind of satire of the art world and rich people. There is not one redeeming in character in the bunch. Everyone is out for themselves, especially when they all get a hold of these paintings. The demand for them is high. And with the greedy comes all the other sins that run for humans.No one is redeemable really. Except for Malkovich character, who is a famous artist is who is not working sober trying to get his groove back. Daveed Diggs (Blindspotting) shows up as that hot artist every company is vying for. They might be the two most redeemable characters in the whole film. It's funny shot at the world around artist stating that the artists are the most redeemable characters in a sea of sharks. But isn't that who it goes, the talent is just the talent.The film does a take a while to get to the main story. For the most part, we are doing world building, putting us in the vicious world. Once the horror beats hit, they come fast and then slows down until the end where it ramps up. The kills are all very different and unique. One of which is quite bloody. I definitely enjoyed a few of them for their uniqueness. But this film is mostly a slow burn. And if you don't get sucked in, then it's a struggle to end which raising way more questions than it answers. Somethings are explained but most of the info we get is for us the viewers to interpret as this happened and maybe that lead to this. There are some comedic moments but those aren't played for hard laughs just subtle giggles. There is a decent running gag with Dyer's character that I enjoyed.I was expecting Gilroy to go wild with this film. I thought we'd get this over the top satire that happens to be a goofy supernatural horror film. I thought the film might be played for laughs mostly. That what I wanted from this film. What I got was the opposite. This could have been a great cult film. The story is not very enticing. Most of the characters are extremely deplorable. By a certain point in the movie, I was hoping everyone would bite it in various ways. It was played way too serious. And most of the great talent here seems like they are sleepwalking through their roles.I'm not saying Gilroy is a one hit wonder. I have not seen his second film Roman J. Israel, Esq. I have read that it's an underrated drama with a great performance from Denzel. But I know that that film and Velvet Buzzsaw are nowhere near on the level that Nightcrawler is. I am severely disappointed with his film. Coulda, woulda, shoulda is what best describes this for me. It wanted a bonkers bloody horror satire with some great actors. It just didn't hit me at all and I felt like I was sleepwalking watching it. Chalk this up to another film we know why Netflix has.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Velvet Buzzsaw is a thriller flick with a simple plot- paintings that try and kill you. As with his direction style, Dan usually focuses on character development more than plot,and he's done well here. The flow is quite entertaining,and though doesn't always deliver, you do find yourself immersed in this world.

A malignant fantasy.I congratulate the makers of this film for showing the utterly corrupt nature of the so-called modern art scene. So for that I applaud them. The main character Jake G. pretends to have insight. But, he just goes with the flow. A corrupt flow of cultural sewage.The meaningless JARGON that flows from these posers was exposed decades ago in Tom Wolfe's ""the Painted Bird"". They make fools of their rich clients who hope to take advantage of ""Greater Fools"" ... this is common in the corrupt zones of the stock markets.One character says: ""It's an equation of the solution at the end"". This is the sort of statement I'd expect to hear in a mental ward...oops, my bad, it's the world of modern art where those ""in the know"" have warped their minds to make sense of the senseless.Modern art is a crime organization. One that would make Tony Soprano puke.
Thanks to Gilroy for shining a light on it.Luckily for us common people the crime mostly affects the very rich. They want to signal their ""Cultural Virtue"" to their friends and are willing to pay a SMALL percentage of their wealth to prance and prune for culturally ignorant business partners.As if this wasn't weird enough, I see a close metaphor between the dealers/critics Oracles that King Leonidas was subject to.

I can't really blame the actors for doing a mediocre job it's not like they had much opportunity to begin with given the script. Every single character is one dimensional, the love triangle is thrown in for no reason and doesn't add anything to the already crappy storyline. I guess the movie's premise is that everyone who tries to benefit from some dead artist's work is a greedy piece of s** and deserves to be cursed or something like that.

The insipid drivel that holds the story together is boring and annoying, and while I get that's the point, it doesn't help the viewer enjoy the scenes. Gyllenhaal does what he can with his hollow character, but his costars and the verbose dialogue do nothing to help him.

163,nyanbatcat,Fun slasher movie!,8,4 February 2019,"Of course there isnt an actual slasher running around, but the movie works exactly like a slasher movie.Velvet Buzzsaw plays out very interestingly, it starts out very serious and character-driven, more like a drama actually, but changes to said slasher-genre, all while keeping the drama plotline alive and intact.
The different characters feel real, even though they are far away from people we see in our everyday life (at least I dont). Sometimes they are a little over-the-top, but it stays in balance, you can feel for them. It is a nice change for something as silly a slasher film to have such a serious drama going on, with arrogant, rich people that still manage to have some likeable features. The two opposites (or I guess in this review Juxtaposition works better) blend well together!There still are a few weaknesses, like the ending seems a bit hollow, true. Other good slashers also dont have a real conclusion, but at the end of the movie it feels like nothing progressed. Im not going to spoil anything and say why I see no progress, because this movie still gets a recommendation from me.

So far so good.But in my opinion it did not add up and the whole movie felt uneven.

A little bit of this, a little bit of that,...and hoping it works? It feels to me like the director did not know in what direction he wanted to take the material.

Unfortunately, it fails miserably.The first major problem is that it is extremely draggy and boring. I had a lot of trouble making it through. This movie is more of a drama and far from horror and thriller. Because of how the film is put together, the very few horror scenes it has just feel very random and pointless. As for the ""thrills"" it was so boring and hard to finish that it didn't even begin to keep me on the edge of my seat.It does succeed more in being a drama, but it is a slow paced boring drama with barely any point.

173,ashishagupta,A feel good horror movie!,8,12 February 2019,"This is not a mainstream movie. It is not designed to appeal to everybody. This is a movie for creative people. It is a catharsis for any creative person who has ever been wronged. The movie speaks for the silent artists.The movie is not some linear story, even though it has one. It is really about a dialogue between the tortured soul of an artist with those who would seek to profit from his misery. Watching the movie is about sitting back and thinking about the questions that it raises. In this sense, you will be watching this movie long after having finished watching it.One of the principal questions that movie raises is: who does art belong to and who gets to arbitrate this ownership? When you listen to a song, who does that song belong to? Does it belong to the singer from whom the sound emanates, or does it belong to the listener whose ears receive the sound? The ownership of the music, the song and the lyrics is simple and known. The singer may sing it again and again and may profit from it each time. But then what about a painting? Why does no artist draw a painting more than once? Why is there only one Mona Lisa?The screenplay is impressively well written. There are several seemingly innocuous bits of dialogue in the movie that make a lot of sense in hindsight as they address the many questions that this movie raises. A repeat viewing should be rewarding.The cast list is appropriate for the movie. The acting is superb.My mind, inured to the regular pattern of narratives in movies, found its choice of protagonist and antagonist during the early half of the movie. Fascinatingly enough, there was quite a reversal of this perception as the movie progressed. Nearing the end, I was thoroughly confused; who are the good guys and who are bad guys in the movie?!The movie sounds a warning for soulless parasites who prey on creative people. Their greatest vanity shall become their doom. The irony is that such people will scarcely understand this movie and so fail to hear the warning.You won't believe it, but this horror movie is actually a feel good movie.

I didn't expect Nightcrawler quality and went solely went into the film to be entertained. I was entertained and overall enjoyed the film. I thought the concept was a good one(though never really fleshed out). The movie seemed confused about what it wanted to be as it moved from genre to genre. I also thought that the screenplay(especially the dialogue) could have used the input of another writer.

177,shalabodov-32997,Was excited for this movie,4,3 February 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw was directed by Dan Gilroy, the man behind Nightcrawler, an amazing thriller with the best performance from Jake Gyllenhaal I've ever seen. So naturally, I was waiting for this movie. The trailer made it look unique and over-the-top and I love arthouse films. And was the movie unique and over-the-top? Yes. In a good way? No.Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor in Hollywood right now and I'm convinced that this man chooses projects very carefully. I guess I should blame the director, then, because Gyllenhaal is the best part of this movie. He completely sold his character, I totally believed his egotistical and rude persona. However, due to the movie's satirical themes, it is very difficult to not get annoyed by how pretentious and obnoxious the entire film is. The movie shoves its satire in your face, without attempting to instead hide its themes, let the viewer discover them via context clues and visual storytelling.Setting aside the satire of the film, the plot is otherwise inept. The chemistry between the characters is stale and does not work. Its weak attempts to turn itself into a horror movie miserably fail, because the movie descends into typical genre cliches, like fake jumpscares and loud noises. On a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully, but the makeup is laughably atrocious, most of the gore is hilarious, I laughed my ass off. I wouldn't even recommend watching it with your friends as a guilty pleasure, because it crawls to halt in its 2nd act and gets unbearably boring. What a shame.",Velvet Buzzsaw
178,austinfromdahood,Dan Gilroy blew it out of the park once again!,8,24 February 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is a netflix movie that didn't get too much love from critics and audiences. It came out very recently, and when I heard it was from the director of Nightcrawler, and that Jake Gyllenhaal was starring in it, I really wanted to watch. I gave Velvet Buzzsaw a watch last night, and I thought it was a really good movie.Right off the bat, Velvet Buzzsaw is not as good as Dan Gilroy's most popular film, Nightcrawler. I thought Nightcrawler was a masterpiece, and Velvet Buzzsaw wasn't as unique as Nightcrawler was. My favorite aspect of Velvet Buzzsaw was its satirical elements about the art world. It was really funny and at times there are times where you shouldn't laugh, but you still do. Velvet Buzzsaw is about the art world and how greed gets in the way of actual art. That's the best way I can describe the film without giving away too much, and there's a bunch of supernatural stuff too by the way.Jake Gyllenhaal was the protagonist in this movie, and he was much more of a different character in this movie than he was in Nightcrawler. In Nightcrawler, he was a sociopath, and in this movie, he's the complete opposite. But I can still see the similarities between the two Gyllenhaal characters. Both characters have something that drives them into a completely different direction, and it changes the whole story. All the acting in this movie was great, especially Jake Gyllenhaal.A problem that I had with this movie is its cliches and predictability. There are some plot elements that I saw from a mile away, but there are also other things that I didn't expect. Some characters are just there to be funny or to say exposition to the audience and not much else. If this movie didn't suffer from this, I think it'd be much better.Netflix has made amazing movies in the past, like Roma, and they have also made mediocre movies like To All The Boys I Have Loved Before, which I still don't get why it got so much praise. Velvet Buzzsaw falls in between those movies as being a good film. 8/10",Velvet Buzzsaw
179,screenotes,Malkovich as the final girl,10,1 February 2019,"With Velvet Buzzsaw, Dan Gilroy succeeds in simultaneously subverting melodrama and slasher film as devious and deluded characters are slowly consumed by the art around which their world revolves.While installations, paintings and ghastly portraits pervade both scene and story, Gilroy's double helix of character arcs, drawn from a clique for whom Art is a business, provides a satisfying juxtaposition. While caricatures to begin with, farce turns to melodrama as hubris turns to hamartia as characters evolve and interweave. Here is the comedy and the tragedy.Walking always a fine line between the profane and the profound, elements of horror lurk in almost every frame. Gilroy shows he is as well versed in Horror as he is in Greek Tragedy.Long before the end of this film, you'll know you need to watch it again. It will be studied in film schools for years to come.

I thought this pulled out some amazing performances from the actors, Gyllenhaal and Russo in particular were brilliant. It was great to see zawe Ashton in it, she must have been overjoyed to have been offered such a prestigious role, as last time I saw her she was on fresh meat, and she played her part beautifully in this. There are some tremendous moments where lack of common decency and empathy were best portrayed, in particular when Gretchens death was believed to be part of the exhibit and children were paddling in the blood, but all parties considered this to be advantageous in increasing the publicity and money of the pieces, and gyllenhall crtiquing a peers funeral casket choice. Proof that people buy the backstory and hype of art for their part of history, more than valuing the artwork and artists vision itself. I loved this film and Netflix continues to strive in its foray into Hollywood and is literally stealing the show from them..and it's actors.

It actually pissed me off.We are intended to hate the characters, I see that now, but Josephina was so disgusting I couldn't stand to watch her. Even Rhodora was more like able and reachable than her. I did like Morph but I hated him with Josephina, she was just repulsive.I think the biggest issue I had with this movie was the missed opportunity with Coco. She found THREE bodies... why wasn't she connected to the dead man??? Come on! That would have been a great twist! They even ended it with what could have been an amazing reveal on her involvement to spread the curse or facilitate it. I think that's what made me the most irritated. The curse itself was cool, good for that evil man, getting his revenge for the theft of his art, but come on! Mix it up, guys!Also, anyone who doesn't love that man for cursing his art and then asking for it to be destroyed, finding his heart after a life time of hate, come on!All and all, I give it 2 stars because I was able to finish it, the acting was good, I was very much drawn into the environment but there were a lot of misses and I can't accept that no one in production or direction saw the many moments that could have made this film great.Ugh.

It's supposed to be some kind of semi-ironic, horror-lite thriller about pretentious art critics and dealers who encounter killer paintings that are haunted or something but the backstory isn't presented in a compelling way so I found myself drifting off into my own thoughts.Rene Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal are watchable and there are a few comic moments but, all in all, the film has too many characters you either don't care about or who aren't drawn very clearly. For example, there is a young woman trying to break into the art world and we're informed in one scene that she needs to hold a steady job or go back to her home state but all this happens right near the end so it has zero impact on your feelings about anything that's happening.I feel like I'm being generous giving this 5 stars but it does look good, is pretty well directed, and has a few decent, creepy moments.

Don't be discouraged by the critics, but this is not for everyone",8,7 February 2019,"The bad reviews of this movie on IMDb show that perhaps this movie is not for everyone - that being sad, don't be discouraged by them - if you're a true art fan - like myself - you'll really like this movie.When watching Velvet Buzzsaw, don't expect a sad, serious criticism about art - here we have a SATYRICAL movie , which is quite comprehensible - when you make a work of a art (a movie) that aims to criticize the art business and its arrogance as whole, you can't take yourself too seriously - otherwise you'll be a hypocrite.This is the story of an anonymous painter called Virgil Dease, who is found dead but who had left many brilliant and clever paintings inside his apartment. A woman who works at a prestigious gallery finds the paintings and they begin to be sold at very high prices, and his art is quickly acclaimed and search for by art collectors. However - things go wrong - and terrible things start to happen to everybody who was selling the pieces or involved in the selling process. Meanwhile, we learn more about Dease's obscure past. A prestigious art critic, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, later on understands what's really going on but by the time he does it it's already too late.Here the discussion relies on how the art world is more concerned about profits and money instead of respecting the artist and its legacy. To those who don't care much about art, it's difficult to notice how museums and galleries can be disrespectful to an artist's legacy, but I'll give you a small example - at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC you can find plush dolls of Van Gogh at the souvenir shop - nothing wrong, right? Except for the fact that all the dolls have a velcro-removable ear - considering that Van Gogh cut off his own ear during a psychotic episode, it is really disgusting to use the sad side-effect of Van Gogh's mental disease as a way to earn money - while basically mocking at him cutting off his own ear. Well, it's about horrible things like this that museums do that this movie is all about.Plot aside, we have the great performances of both Jake Gyllenhaal (who is a flawless, solid actor who can basically do anything he wants) and Toni Colette (can she ever do anything wrong?). Direction and pacing are amazing - I barely blinked the entire movie , it's absurdly entertaining and interesting.Unfortunately, the deepness, beauty and complexity of this movie fails to be appealing to the masses - especially the masses that signed up for Netflix. This satyrical yet brilliant movie is not for everyone - but its criticism is real and very appropriate in a world where true art is left aside in the name of money, and the greatest masterpieces are not exhibited to the public, but locked inside mansions of billionaires.",Velvet Buzzsaw
189,redcanofevil,So much untapped potential,5,28 November 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is yet another misfire by Dan Gilroy whose Directorial debut ""Nightcrawler"" is one of my favourite movie ever. A distraught setting, an interesting and workable plot all fall flat due to absence of cohesivity resulting in a movie that dragged on longer than it needed to being tonally confused. Some decent performance and an astute cinematography aside, Velvet Buzzsaw offers nothing worth merit or applause. Over abundance of dialogue and a haphazard script only prolonged the suffering of sitting through a very asinine screenplay.",Velvet Buzzsaw
190,MekkaMax,Wasted Potential,4,2 February 2019,"If you saw the trailer, you've seen the best parts.Inside this movie was a great thriller with good performances under the messy pacing and story telling. Jake Gyllenhaal probably gives the greatest performance in this movie but that's not saying much as he is not giving his all. The movie also keeps building and building up to what we all came here to see and by the point it gets interesting, it was too little too late. The first 1 hour and 20 minutes was a lot of uninteresting character building and story development which actually made me hate some of the characters. They were not particularly memorable or charming. John Malkovich, being a big marketing point in the trailer is extremely wasted as his character barely does anything and could have been played by anybody. In the horror/thriller department, the movie is very predictable as you can tell when the scares are going to happen as well as how the scene will play out. There were two great scenes that I loved. Both of which include Gyllenhaal starting to lose his sanity and I could feel the tension in those scenes. Overall, I feel that this movie was a huge step down from Gilroy's first film Nightcrawler which also stars Gyllenhaal.",Velvet Buzzsaw

That's the best way to explain 'Velvet Buzzsaw'. Some may be turned off by its pretentiousness and terrible leads. Even some of the greatest works of art have their flaws. If you look past some of these flaws, however, you'll find some amazing actors giving their best, both chilling and beautiful imagery, all while not being overly serious by playing up the dry wit.

I enjoyed his scenes but the rest of the movie is bland, boring or laughable. There could be an interesting movie beneath all the forced pretentiousness in here.The trailer shows pretty much literally everything worth seeing in the movie. The rest of the movie was just people explaining the plot to the viewer, it's nothing you haven't seen before. Characters throwing embarassingly obvious metacommentary about the current state of whatever just made me feel annoyed. Art, movies, superheroes, this movie tries to say something about everything.Director Dan Gilroy's previous movie with Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler, was such a thrill to watch. Did Netflix have something to do with the quality of the movie? All the Netflix Originals I've seen recently have been really formulaic and bad, like The Discovery or Annihilation.I really wanted to like this movie.

The trailer itself gave me an eerie feeling and I thought to myself maybe this is one of those ""trying too hard"" movies, where there could be potential, excellent sotry telling etc but just isn´t.Well. I started watching and even halfway trhough wasn´t sure what to think of it and I was tried aswell so I didn´t do as much thinking as the movie actually wants you to do. You really have to put yourself in that scenery, think about the meaning of art, meaning of specific art pieces you see in the movie and try to feel what the characters feel. If you don´t do that then yeah, you could easily give this movie a 3-4 stars out of 10. So when I really invested myself in the movie and observed the details, the emotions, the art itself - I got the bigger picture and felt quite entertained actually. It actually was suspensful, frightening at times, ridiculous, funny and most of all uinque.As for the characters and actors. I cannot deny that Jake did an amazing job as Morf - the whole essence of a art critic who is a bit insecure, a bit of a nervous looney, in love with a very opposite kind of person - it was all very well embodied. Great job, Jake! Other actors I liked as well, bu Zawe Ashton as Josephina stood out for me - the cold and bitchy, yet uncertain and emotional type of character who was intrigued and mesmerized by money and fame - I felt it with her every word and look. So again, well done.I really couldn´t give this movie anything below 7, because the purposeof movies is to entertain, stir up somekind of emotions and thoughts and this is exactly what this film did for me. And yes the amazing cast adds massive value.",Velvet Buzzsaw

200,Jiszmo,Very smart and entertaining film,10,26 April 2020,"I was not expecting to like this film. A film about rich yuppy hipsters in art galleries, what? I have had a fair amount of experience in this scene, and I generally hate it, and most of the people involved.That being said, I absolutely loved this movie. It's a real credit to the movie that I would enjoy it, while hating it's main setting. But boy did I enjoy it.It's a very smart film. The dialog is smart and witty. The characters all act in a very realistic way. These characters are all just like the ones I used to know (except substantially richer). This film really captures the art scene perfectly.The cinematography is next level. It's very beautifully filmed. It almost has a Dario Argento type feel to it. At many points in the film I was reminded of Tenebre. Maybe it's just the stylish rich places. idk Either way, the cinematography was one of the highlights for me. You can tell alot of money was put into just this aspect.As for the story: It was good and the ending really unexpected. I didn't know anything about this film going into it. I didn't even know the genre. So, throughout most of the movie it just seemed to be a dark comedy about the art world. Then, all of a sudden, I found myself in a full on horror film. Wow! I did not see that coming. But, that's probably my fault for not realizing what genre I was watching. I loved it though. Oh, and the story about the artists. I loved that too. Which, once again, I need to say that I dislike these types of people and the art gallery scene. But, the story was just so engaging and well written. I couldn't help but be pulled in.Humor: The humor is really subtle here. It's definitely a dark comedy. And, it's very funny. But, there aren't alot of jokes or anything. It's subtle smart humor. It probably helps if you know the character types they are parodying. In my case I did.Horror: This was good too. Though it doesn't try to get in the way of the story. It's more like the cherry on top of a delicious sunday. But, don't get me wrong, the horror aspect is an essential part of the overall story too. It is scary though. And at least once there was some pretty dramatic gore.PC gays: It has some gay people. But, unlike most movies where they are obviously added to be PC. Here that isn't the case at all. I mean, the film is set in the world of art galleries. Of course there are going to be gay people. lolAnyways, final verdict: This movie blew me away. I consider it one of those rare gems that you might stumble upon after months of wading through mediocre crap. If you have some intelligence and wish to see a truly great horror/ black comedy check this out.",Velvet Buzzsaw

It was very believable.It took quite some time for the climax/point of the plot to unfold and so the movie seemed drawn out at some points. The plot was very interesting and the movie could have benefited from a bit more focus on the character Dease. Exploring his backstory a bit more, giving him more of a presence would have made the movie fuller/more rounded.Overall I think all actors did a wonderful job.

202,demonsquipster,haha jake gyllenhaal nakey,6,4 October 2019,"This film. tons of people hate it. personally, I've watched it more than once before writing this review, just to really let it sink in. Review writing about a movie that critiques review writing feels ironic, yet here I am. I appreciated the prominent dark, satirical humour throughout the film, and how well it was mixed with the horror and character deaths. The pacing of the film caught me off-guard, as it went from slow and forgettable to fast and intriguing within the blink of an eye. Toni Collette's performance as Gretchen is fantastic, but Jake Gyllenhaal certainly steals the show with Morf Vandewalt. Morf is pretentious, shallow, condescending, and Jake plays him so well. After seeing Netflix produce second-rate knock-off horror movies that aspire to be equally terrible movies (Happy Death Day, Paranormal Activity, etc), Velvet Buzzsaw is truly a breath of fresh air. It's well-acted, produced, edited, and written - well, that last one is debatable. The cinematography is beautiful.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays a very interesting character - an art reviewer and critique. He made an interesting performance playing great his gay/bisexual art reviewer role.
John Malkovich as usual is also great - he plays the role of an artist with a huge lack of inspiration, but a well known artist in the artist society. A guy with great oratorical skills, but with no inspiration.
The story takes place in Miami. After an artist dies, his paintings are taken from his apartment and people are trying to obtain profit or get rich using the found paintings.
It's just that a series of unfortunate events happen after people start watching the paintings.
Deadly unfortunate events which seem to punish the greed and all those who tried to obtain an advantage after they put their hands on the paintings.",Velvet Buzzsaw

205,fpcholcomb,"Interesting Premise, Uninteresting Movie",3,3 February 2019,"Simply put Velvet Buzzsaw is a mess. It lacks any genuine horror, comedy, or drama and feels cheap and schlocky, and not in the good b-movie horror way.This one stung because when I first heard of this film I thought it was right up my alley. The faux intellectualism and aggressive monetization that surrounds the high art world is something worthy of parody, but this movie gets so lost in its message and meanders around several poorly written characters, essentially wasting its interesting premise on a below average, generically shot bit of schlock. It brings nothing to the table and fails to live up to the standards set by its contemporaries and even the directors past work.The characters presented here are lacking in about every respect. One of the things that really excited me about this movie was the massive amount of talent it employed, but even a lively performance from the likes of Gyllenhaal could not mask the fact that the writing was just not up to snuff. What exposition and backstory we get on this miserable bunch of narcissistic artistes is sparse and told rather than shown through slow interactions within art galleries and avant garde offices. Perhaps it was an artistic choice to paint these characters who leech of the creative works of others as banal but it prevented me from ever getting invested in them. Thus, not only were the inevitable horror scenes that followed the character introductions were completely void of any proper scares or interesting creatures, but they also lacked any proper victims.Moreover, the editing was choppy and scenes did not always flow logically from one to the other. There was a surprising lack of interesting camera angles or dark and brooding shots that could have been used to cultivate horror in the viewer (with the exception of a scene involving a gas station and monkeys). Velvet Buzzsaw's presentation lacked a certain definitiveness and style that the directors earlier work had possessed. It ends up looking rather uninspired. There was some aggressively unappealing use of green screen too, especially apparent during a waterfront chat between an agent and a up and coming street artist (I can't even remember there names they left so little an impression). The movie looks so fake and cheap, which I suppose in a way fit the character and dialogue quality.Apart from its blatant ant-art profiteering message the movie seems to translate nothing effectively, and the overall weight of what it tries to say is diminished by its shortcomings. The actor's do what they can here, they are the only redeemable aspect of Velvet Buzzsaw, but an artist is only as good as his or her tools, and they were given very little to work with here.Definitely Avoid.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Was NOTHING like my expectations, and I laughed my ample rear end off!The satire was throughout-an almost grating depiction of the pretentiousness and self-importance of the ""definers of taste"" and their callous disregard for the artists they represent, merely to access the rich and powerful looking to park their money. Best line underscoring this: ""What's the point if you aren't selling it?""My motto is ""the secret to happiness is low expectations"", but though this failed to meet any of mine, I still enjoyed the ride.

It is also infused with a loopy, early 1970s AIP (American International Pictures) sensibility (such as in the ""Dr. Phibes"" movies) where a bunch of snooty, awful people get their comeuppance in a variety of creative manners. Add a little dose of television's ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery"" (where inanimate objects were frequently coming to ""life"" and wreaking havoc) and a splash of ""Final Destination"" set pieces and there you have it.

That was quite a movie. Relevant. Edgy. It left me shook. That movie had purpose and drive.Velvet Buzzsaw has very little OOMPH. I read a couple of reviews previous to watching. Some said it would benefit from being more insane, a little more adrenaline filled.You are given a glimpse into the big money making side of art galleries. Introduced to a few characters who are not likeable but hold attention. It feels a little like a made for TV movie in a bad way.The most glorious thing about the movie is the pieces of art work shown. I would happily pay to view most of the work shown at any of these galleries. Is this film about the art world and critics and their greedy motivations behind that (greed)? Is this about a tortured artist with mental health issues who haunts those after his demise? Damned if I got what was being said.Some visual flair. As a horror film it failed. As a comedy it failed.Velvet Buzzsaw has these ridiculous gore filled death scenes that are put in with a 'jump scare' quality. So is this trying to be a horror movie? If so. Again. fail.What is being said was not clear to me. the performances were all very average.Not essential. But the artwork and the galleries and the whole artistic world is quite mesmerising.

Greedy profesionals from the ""chic"" art-gallery bussiness.An artist pours their experience, soul, emotions and illusion into a piece, and when all that is just treated for the ""chic"" and ""popular"" value and exploited, without any apreciation on all that's behind, something's wrong.We see that in different moments from artists that suffer the consequences of these greedy profesionals that don't care about the artist, just about that sweet dolla, and their own reputation and ego.In a world driven by this kind of behaviour. It's the own art's responsability to put an end to them.I can clearly see the message Dan Gilroy was transmitting and I loved it and applaud him for it as an artist myself.

There are of course some similarities despite the thematic difference between Nightcrawler and Velvet Buzzsaw.The social commentary is still there, even more pronounced, the black humor as well. As for being classified as a horror, I think it's too much and it will turn out to be a ""marketing"" flaw.From the beginning I noticed the cinematography, was amazed how well the shots were composed, but also script wise, there were some memorable lines about art and what makes us humans.The hypocrisy and fake elitism of the art world is very well put into context, though some characters are obviously too cliché but being a satire, it fits well most times. I liked the fact that It shows how this world became so corrupt and without humanity, how the young generation that work in this field learn from the start that in order to succeed in this domain, you need to be able to manipulate and sell yourself.Art should have been truth, but nowadays in the consumerism era, it has become a commodity, it's not a personal experience anymore (we value more what other people think of it, like reviewers).So, ""art"" found the punisher, the one who will revenge all the wrongdoings. Everyone will be punished with their own character flaws. The creator? An unknown painter who used art as a cathartic element, his art was created from pain and suffering.Jack Gyllenhaal does a great part and reminds me of his acting in Donnie Darko, Rene Russo and Toni Collette playing their part great as well.
I cannot say more about the plot without spoiling the pleasure of discovery, in conclusion I highly recommend it and give it a 9 out of 10, thought it will receive a 10 just because I think the ones who misinterpreted it gave very low ratings.PS: it felt like similar to a revenge movie I've seen long time ago, ""Long weekend"", where nature takes revenge on a couple that didn't show the proper respect.",Velvet Buzzsaw

And they are all good reasons. However the film never makes the most of any of these 4 points.The actors have a clunky and slightly cheesy script and have definitely decided to ham it up and just be silly with it.The horror is not that horrible and seems more dark fantasy than a thriller style horror. The special effect are at times ridiculous and so cheap looking. The premise is confused and the idea that the art work is making other art work so bad things is never really explored not exploited.It is set in a sexy glossy cold empty world, and that's what's both slightly intriguing and also equally off putting.

Thought this was a stylistic choice to begin with but it's never to any particular end, she's just straight up crazy.Visually speaking: it's pretty good. Given the subject matter though, it probably could have had a bit more work out into it to be a bit more creative. There's one scene where they pull off a dolly zoom with a stationary camera and they manage to film a spherical mirror without any reflection of the camera, so big kudos for that at least.So I guess in summary it's alright but it's not much of a follow up to Nightcrawler if you are considering watching this because of how good that one was and I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone.",Velvet Buzzsaw

It feels like an amalgam of a whole litany of stylistic and narrative influences, it's strongest being the totally air-headed (and overpraised) bourgeois satire of Bret Easton Ellis and Cronenberg's vacuous critique of vacuousness, the ensemble film Maps to the Stars. Here's the thing about Velvet Buzzsaw, however: it is better than it's influences.Much of the film is genuinely inspired, from the beautiful cinematography, set-design and gorgeous color palette to the excellent turns from the main cast, specifically Jake Gylenhall . While some aspects of it's narrative could have been more fleshed out (specifically the background of it's villain) and the slightly-jumbled introductions to our many characters could have been tighter, it's ultimately brought down by it's weak satire. It's a stale take on the modern-art world, and as a result, there is a acidic backwash that eeks throughout the rest of the film, bringing down the enjoyment level significantly.But ultimately, I like this film a-lot more than most are giving it credit for.",Velvet Buzzsaw

It's a very interesting look at the world of art and it ended up being a dark horror movie with some very interesting kills including an ending that gets truly bizarre. Gyllenhaal and Russo give really fantastic performances but my god Toni Collette steals the movie with a performance that is so amazing and the last scene with her is perfect and definitely a moment that made me jump.",Velvet Buzzsaw

I liked the premise of the movie and the first 1/3 was interesting enough to keep me entertained and invested in the characters but the writing fell apart halfway through, and the climax was just hollow and predictable. Spoiler alert beyond this point: the name of the movie is Velvet Buzzsaw- which is a very catchy title- but there's nothing relevant in the entire movie to Velvet Buzzsaw other than 4 seconds of dialog explaining how the name is in reference to a metal band- and the last few minutes of the movie where the decades old buzzsaw tattoo comes alive on the skin and kills the person with the tattoo. I felt like the director forgot the name of the movie was Velvet Buzzsaw, then with a few minutes left in the movie, asked his 13 yo son how to include the Velvet Buzzsaw in the story line, and the 13 yo responds by telling him to just have the tattoo come alive and kill her- which totally didn't fit the narrative of previous character deaths!

It has its own vibe, which is reflected by the performances and locations that the movie had. It is interesting the way they capture the art spirit in a movie. But even with a good atmosphere and performances the movie itself is really slow, the movie just tried to give too much for a simple story, at least for me, a simple story that goes around for almost 2 hrs. If this movie only last 1:30 hours is for sure that Velvet Buzzsaw would be better. Anyway, if you have time and enjoy the art you can watch it and probably enjoy it.",Velvet Buzzsaw
237,rsforss,This Buzzsaw Lacks Teeth,6,6 March 2019,"The acting is fantastic. The dialogue is clever. The cinematography is clean and effective. The concept is a whole lot of fun. And you know what? The supposedly mesmerizing art is actually pretty evocative.So why is the end product so uninspired?Well, the death sequences might have something to do with it. As much fun as they should be, something about their presentation is just... off. Getting chased by a mechanical hobo on crutches is pretty spectacular, but having it merely snap your neck is actually rather bland on camera. And being hung by a scarf? Surprisingly dull. Then there's a death that's pretty much a paint-by-numbers headscratcher, but that one's almost a little too vague. Exactly how did she die? Radiation poisoning by a weird snapchat effect?The implied death by grease monkeys is probably the best death of the entire
film. It's fun, has interesting buildup, and leaves just enough out to keep the menace alive even as we know the character definitely isn't.But the deaths are the only sticking point of this comedic horror. Truthfully, the message behind this story is more mess than art, and that turns out to be a rather significant sticking point for me.This movie dissects the insanely pretentious world of art profiteering from the extremely haughty perspective of the ""Art for Art's Sake!"" clubhouse. I have no problem with that in itself, this is a tongue-in-cheek movie that takes great joy in destroying it's own premise. But I think it might have gone a bit farther than it intended.What exactly is the message? Well, let's try to summarize:Exploiting art is bad, obviously, and so is judging it - especially if you're getting paid to do so. And be sure not to judge the art on the probable depravity of the artist. And don't show it to anyone, but also don't store it away. Selling it on the street corner might be okay - jury's out on that one. And maybe you can like it, if you promise not to like it too much, or show it to anyone else. Who knows; art's a fickle mistress.Actually, it's probably best to just burn it. Burn it all up. Art should only exist for the artist anyways. Boo to anyone else that thinks or feels anything about a piece of art.Which...what? Is that really what the movie was aiming for? I get the feeling it was hoping to go in a more ""art should be pure"" direction, and only meant to really tear apart the profiteering, but honestly, it doesn't really hit the mark. If anything, the movie makes you feel like artists are essentially pointless to society, and that art has no communal value.There's actually one moment in the movie where some really amazing sincerity bleeds though - when the art critic is trapped in a soundproof room, tormented by his own voice as it echoes some rather scathing art critiques. It's in this moment that the critic seems to realize he's nothing more than a schoolyard bully, and it's beautiful.Sadly, this scene just highlights how most of the rest of the film is a subtle letdown. Nothing about it is awful, but the truly brilliant moments don't come often enough, and in the end, we're left with a critique that isn't sharp enough to cut an impression.",Velvet Buzzsaw

What a waste of Jake Gyllenhaal's excellent performance.The plot basically consisted of set-pieces in which the main characters are killed in ways that were sorta kinda related to art.

252,ftonks,"Hard to believe this is the same director of Nightcrawler, but decent movie.",6,26 June 2020,"I think everyone who saw that Dan Gilroy would be directing Velvet Buzzsaw had very high hopes, especially those who saw the masterpiece known as Nightcrawler, and I know a lot of people were disappointed by this one, me included. But that definitely doesn't mean that this is a bad or a horrible movie. If i'm honest, it's actually pretty decent, but I think most would agree it leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. The plot is fairly simple, spirit of a dead painter haunts and kills the rich snobs that have purchased his work, which I guess was slightly intriguing to me. Of course it's nowhere near quality story telling but it's the kind of plot that would entertain, yet the film only partly succeeded in that. The whole film just feels like a comedy or a drama, then suddenly switches to horror to pick off the characters one by one, and repeat. There was nothing interesting about any of the characters on the screen, they were just there for about 5 minutes, then appear later in the film to get killed. In a nutshell, what i'm trying to say is how half of the characters there, were only used to just be victims and get killed off. I have to give credit to some of the deaths, i'm not someone who enjoys all this blood and death on screen, but they were very clever and I liked how they used art to kill their own purchasers. That is one smart thing that I really enjoyed about the film, if only it would continue to be this smart. Jake Gyllehaal kills it, as always, and is an incredible actor that never gets enough love from the Academy. His unique, sometimes funny, and entertaining performance was the savior of this film. Rene Russo, Toni Collette, who I have been a big fan of since Hereditary, all were superb. Even Nancy Wheeler from Stranger Things was pretty good! All of the cast were fun to watch, even though they may have seemed flat at times, and i'm glad Jake and Rene got to work together again, because I love their chemistry. Sadly, this is a horror that relies on cheap jumpscares, a lot of the deaths were jumpscares, and predictable ones at that. If you've read my review of Slender Man, you'd know im not a fan of poorly done jumpscares. But some in the film landed, around 40% made me jump a bit, but not enough for me to give some praise. But one thing I loved from the deaths wasn't just their creativity, but the dark humor. I don't want to spoil any of darkly comedic scenes as this review is spoiler free, but I found myself laughing a lot. Another thing I wasn't too fond of was the ending, if you watch the film you will see what I mean, but it feels like something was missing, but I still liked the ambiguity, so I equally like and don't like the ending.
Verdict: Generic plot, some useless characters and some clichés will probably disappoint, but excellent performances from some of the cast, creative deaths, and some laugh out loud dark comedy, still make for a decent fun ride. Worth watching, don't expect something Nighcrawler.
My grade is around a C+.",Velvet Buzzsaw
253,kdlprod75018,Great portrayal of the art market but flawed plot and cheap effects,7,8 February 2019,"Velvet buzzsaw is worth the watch despite my initial reservations looking at the trailer which had too many cheesy gory undertones. I wished the director had stuck to something more subtle, with less reliance on cheezy scary special effects for the more somber underpinnings of his message about the meaninglessness and vapidity of the art market. Too bad it tried to convey such a neat message about the true value of an artwork by relying on cheap special effects in lieu of utilizing optical or psychological tricks to convey the affect those artworks/paintings have on its audience and especially those who took advantage of it.
Still this film is a great portrayal of the art market and the various incestuous relationships between gallery owners, art critics, curators, museums, artists and collectors who all work together to increase the value of artworks and their own status within the market. A gem in that respect as you see the museum curators being blackmailed by gallery owners to exhibit recently privately acquired artworks in order to up the value of the artist and his/her works. You also get a peek into the satire that is the high art world. I won't say too much but needless to say that it is accurate and even more underwhelming than in real life, but still kudos for the filmmaker's courage in tackling such a tough subject matter that will no doubt concern critics who will not be able to acknowledge the existence of it all as it gives a bad rep to the art market and rightly so.
The plot makes reference to situations that occurred in real life like the death of Henry Darger and how the discovery of his artworks gave way to a craze about his paintings, while akso paying hommage to artitsts like Banksy who sold his artworks to rich collectors but also people from the street for very cheap.
The actors are all pretty good in the movie and it is a great cast which unfortunately couldn't really go beyond portraying caricatures of their characters due to the principal flaw of the film that is relying on cheap gory tricks and murder scenes to convey a much deeper meaning to the story.... sigh... the movie could have been a masterpiece had it been directed by say David Lynch... Still it is a very worthwhile watch for its spot albeit caricatural on depiction of the art world and its marketplace.",Velvet Buzzsaw
254,tomsuthblack,You can't sell the Beach! Let alone hang it on someone's wall (and that's what the movie is about),8,2 February 2019,"The movie is an ambitious attempt that suffered from one major problem. The movie's great ambition is to define art, true art that expresses a true human experience, and to differentiate it from overpriced items collected by dumb rich people who wish to buy taste and sophistication with money.
The movie's major problem is that it failed to translate this message into a comprehensible cinematic experience which could reach, and be enjoyed by, the largest possible audience. What A pity . Let me try to show you how this happened:The story here is a fantasy based on an interesting magical assumption: What if the experience reflected by each and every work of art becomes real, and becomes felt by those who look at it.
What if art becomes ""so moving"" that it actually moves before your eyes, vibrant with life?What if the monsters on a painting come alive to reflect the suffering that led the artist to draw them? What if the pain, fear, melancholy, menace and agony reflected by a work of art all become physical and materialized?The only factor that would allow you to survive and keep your sanity in such case would be the honesty of reflection, honesty of art. Any pretense in representing your feelings can devour you, any pretense in assuming you can reciprocally understand other people's feelings through their art can turn you to a prey for their torments. You can only be safe in such conditions if you stick to the real feelings. Only then can you create real art.To do that, you need to create your art by yourself for yourself, not as a posh pretentious craftsman catering to the taste of a market, but as a playful child, messing around on a beach, making circles in the sand for no one but himself to see.
An impressive concept executed in such an enigmatic way that is guaranteed not to be understood by almost everyone who watches it!

That's the message or in this case how I would have described this movie. The whole setting in the art world of L.A. and with a cast of unlikable characters together with the premise of a discovered art, done by an artist who passed away recently and the deaths of people who are exploiting his painting for their personal gains, pretty much sounds a lot for a movie but at the same time it can be interesting if its well executed. How did it turn out? Could have been better. The whole art world of L.A. in itself is full of pretentious, you can say snobbish people, who are fake and backstabbers in every possible way and this movie highlights that and together with the discovery of several paintings done by a nobody, these people exploit it and in return, as you guessed it, die or disappear. What really worked for me though is the supernatural elements incorporated into an otherwise kinda light movie? The whole backstory about the painter and his troubled life and the way these people die or disappear under mysterious circumstances kept me awake whenever its on. But when the movie focuses on these ""art"" people and their daily routine, romance/affair and planning or whatever is when I kinda lose my attention and didn't really care. I guess the performance of actors like Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo and others did a really good job in playing snobs? I don't have any liking for them at all and I guess its intentional?

260,mwpm,The line between chic and murder is very blurred these days,5,1 February 2019,"A film about art is not inherently artistic. Although director Dan Gilroy intended the film as a commentary on the superficiality of the art world (superficiality at odds with art as a form of expression in which artists have invested their ""creative soul"") he has contrived a film that is superficial, a film that lacks a soul. I stipulate ""contrived"" because the characters are one-note, archetypal, and neither develop nor provide substantial commentary in their lack of development; because the plot feels like a hodge-podge of Gothic themes and motifs superimposed on a modern setting, without a clear motive (aside from entertainment); because the film doesn't say anything about the art world that hasn't been said before.The cast is strong, but I can't help but feel their talents are wasted (because they are playing one-note archetypes). The film is entertaining, but the thrills are often cheapened by their execution (a world is constructed, a world in which the supernatural is possible, and that world has certain guiding rules and principles, but those rules are loosely adhered to, thereby unintentionally challenging the suspension of disbelief).The superficiality of the film can be summarized by its title. Rather than providing something of substance, writer/director Dan Gilroy has opted for something that lacks relevance, something that is flashy and attention grabbing.

264,liz-amin,My short and spoiler-free review fo 'Velvet Buzzsaw',6,8 February 2019,"Netflix's latest original film 'Velvet Buzzsaw' started to show last week and only now have I got the chance to actually and properly watch it. You see, the trailer for this film got me hyped considering there's Jake Gyllenhaal and Toni Collete, both being one of the most famous actors ever! And the story, the way they present it in the trailer actually works!However, when I finished watching the movie in its entirety: the first thing that was in my mind was just 'kay.'. Dan Gilroy actually had the potential to do something much more bigger than what we've seen since its based from his own idea, but he did not. 'Velvet Buzzsaw' could have been a great film actually, it's just that the execution of the plot and the performance of some actors fell short.But, this was actually quite refreshing for the horror genre. I think from all of the films I've seen so far, Dan Gilroy was the first to blend the art & design genre with horror. Pretty inventive, I have to admit. Jake Gyllenhaal as Morf was pretty good I have to say, since I think I've never saw him in a proper horror movie role. It's just that 'Velvet Buzzsaw' could have been a great art-horror movie, but it's just like the makers of the movie decided to just make a movie for the heck of it instead of making a GREAT movie.Overall, 'Velvet Buzzsaw' was an okay film. But definitely something to consider if you just binged horror movies and tired of horror stories like spirits from other worlds or so, since this is actually blending contemporary art with modern-world horror. And I can see that Dan Gilroy is actually trying to deliver a message, which is to not love art for money, but instead love it as it is. And value it. Now that is a great message.But if you had other movie choices that you think is better to watch than this, definitely go ahead. Because it may be better.",Velvet Buzzsaw

As for the story, it really seemed novel (or at least interesting), as a reader of comics, I found myself thinking that it could have been the plot of some bizarre pretty much unknown comic.",Velvet Buzzsaw
266,betaworld2046,"It could've been another Muholland Dr., if with a more revealing story.",8,17 June 2019,"From the rating, Velvet Buzzsaw doesn't seem to appeal to wide audience. I sort of understand that. I think it is more about the angle you look at it from and the resulted expectation deviates from the intention of the movie.Let me start with that, it is a very well made movie. I am not really watching many movies, so I am not good at recognizing faces. But even I can tell, the cast is very talented and extremely devoted. The result is spectacular performance throughout the whole time. Setup is also great. From time to time, I really enjoyed looking at those Dease arts. Kind of remind me of ""the Scream/Shriek"" and some of Van Gogh's works, when he was sad. Definitely Norwegian. I think I could go through the movie again just to go through the paintings and some conversations again.However, it is my opinion that, it is not primarily an art movie, but a horror in the core. The first 1/2 to 2/3 part is disguised like a drama of art critics and some dirty operation in art business. Then, more often would you hear the eerie tunes. People started to die. Their ambition and greedy was like a derailed train ramming and spinning out of control. Anyone related to Dease's arts and having done some wrongdoings were kind of cleansed by the evil spirits living in the paintings. It is not only about greediness. For example, Morf was against any kind of ""paid reviews"", but was also killed because he wrote an untruthful art review to please his girlfriend Josephina... He only liked studying Dease's life and works.So what I mean is, the movie is not 100% about the value of art, altitude of critics or creativity of artists. It puts right and wrong in B&W, and kills everyone who is black. That is the kind of horror movie approach. Also, at least the last 1/3 is almost solely about suspension and killing scenes, which would not have happened in a drama. That is why people felt the story is undone, because for most horror movies storyline is designed to set up tension rather than to discuss something in depth.I like watching horror movies, if they are good. It has been increasingly difficult to find any horror worth watching at all as more I viewed. I think Velvet Buzzsaw is worth watching. In more than one place, it reminds me of Muholland Dr, even the same street name showed up towards the end of the movie. By watching the first half, I was thinking it could be the 2nd Muholland Dr. But the ending is less revealing or enlightening in my opinion. But very nice, nevertheless.",Velvet Buzzsaw

I read a lot of reviews and only very recently started posting comments myself. I think one of the problems with reviews.. or rather, the audience itself... is that they don't judge movies based on what the movie is trying to accomplish. This is an original horror movie, one that it isn't geared for torture porn lovers or to be the next pg13 block buster hit. It's original. And I suppose it says something about art and society. But really it's just a unique ghost story. And, as a horror film, with a supernatural side it has some of what many ppl like to refer to as cliches, But... so what! It's not about that. As long as it fits and advances the story, which it does. Thats why I like the genre... anything can happen, and to me, that means something. Each and every story like this creates and invites you into a new and mysterious world. I've seen lots of movies with high speed chases, killing and sex, but never wld I say a story is unoriginal for any of that... so why pick on horror/supernatural? In fact, why does a tv show like Supernatural (Sam and Dean) show demons and angels and monsters fighting and dying episode after episode and yet maintain a loyal following, while movies like this are criticized for having 'same old' cgi supernatural tropes? We don't get many movies like this one with high production values, and based on these reviews we won't see many more. Doesnt anyone appreciate a good old fashioned ghost story anymore? Because that's what this is... a good ghost story in a new and unique setting. And I liked it.",Velvet Buzzsaw

And if you have seen Gilroy's Nightcrawler, you'll believe that this is going to be surprisingly good. Well, it is surprisingly mediocre. It hurts to see Jake Gyllenhaal in such a poor context. He is still great though. The same goes for John Malkovich, who plays an artist who, like himself (being Malkovich?), is worried about doing is own genuine thing and doesn't care about the greedy and cruel players like big galleries, museums and failed-artists-turned-critics.I suppose that viewers will either be too distracted with all the supernatural stuff or find the movie's criticism too unrealistic. It's not subtle.

It's not even about ""getting"" it actually. There is no secret or implied ending/plot which people missed. Characters feel so cartoonish but so unique. Such good acting. Such an interesting story, what an idea to create a movie out of! I think most people nowadays just expect a film to make sense almost in a mathematical way and if you keep the movie up to those standards, it's not a good movie. And I also get that if you're not that into visual arts, or practice painting yourself in particular, you might also find it absurd and meaningless. If you expect good special effects this is also not for you.What this movie is, is a modern horror fairytale. A story no one really ever told in this way. A brave one, too. The movie is an original artwork which will be forgotten & resting in dust, because it won't ever be that popular, like Dease's work never did, in the film.That is, until someone uncovers it, looks deeply in it, feel all the feelings and ideas that went into it and it gives that person chills.",Velvet Buzzsaw

287,realreeceallen,Painfully meh.,4,1 February 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is, unfortunately, painfully dull. Not bad, but dull. The trailer made it out to be a tense, artsy horror and a must watch, with an intriguing premise which felt fresh. But, simply put, it wasn't tense enough to be thrilling, funny or dark enough to be comical, or scary enough to be a horror - genuine scares were too few and too far between. The ending is also very rushed, as Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo and Zawe Ashton's characters are killed in the final ten minutes, Natalia Dyer's character (who is basically there to scream) moves back to Michigan, and John Malkovich's character is an afterthought in the credits, and this is all after a slow hour and a half build up. Also, Toni Collette and John Malkovich are severly underused in their parts.
However, all of the cast are exceptional in their roles - in particular Jake Gyllenhaal, who hams it up just perfectly, and what scary scenes there were in the film were good - you'll keep looking at the paintings to see if they move. Also, Gyllenhaal's death scene is one of the tensest scenes in the film, as is Collette's. Russo is also good in her part, although it seens like some sort of plot thread didn't make it into the final cut as it is revealed that one of the paintings resembles the position she's sat in.
All in all, this film is quite disappointing, but the performances are good enough to keep your attention.",Velvet Buzzsaw
288,sazesa,Smartly written--funny and thought-provoking if you catch his drift,7,6 February 2019,"I won't bother with a summary of the plot because it's been covered by nearly everybody else who has commented. What I want to say is that the writing is good. The characters are over-the-top, as is expected in a satire. The exaggeration of each character's flaws contributes to the snarkiness of the writer, who brings us along for the ride with little more than a wink here and there.The hook is the mysterious nature of art--the metaphysical element that gives all of these flawed characters their cummupence--in a world devoid of spirituality (that is, in a world driven by titillation of the senses, pretentiousness, and greed). Which is not to say that the writer advocates for simple-minded reevaluation of a life without God, in the Biblical sense, but perhaps in the sense that values are distorted--""and monetized""--when we lose sight of what art is meant to do: to let us see anew and experience insight and wonder.The message is plainly delivered at various points in the movie and in rather blatant terms: ""Oh wait, in our world, you are God,"" says the art dealer to the critic; ""Critique is so limiting and emotionally draining"" muses the critic who is indignant at being thought to be in collusion with the art dealer to set the price of particular pieces--he, after all, imagines himself to be ""furthering the realm he analyzes."" All of those lines are delightful barbs at the pretentious world of those who don't create but make a living on the basis of those who do. And, we, the spectators are invited to laugh at them even as we consume the artistic product of this cinematic medium for our own titillation--even if not for our own profitS.",Velvet Buzzsaw

There is no depth in the movie and the last 20 minutes felt like they rushed to make an ending. And where I was expecting interesting characters we got barely anything. Most of them are just typical art world people and I felt like some of the actors really missed the line between actual character and boring caricature.
But I was most dissapointed with the interesting storylines the movie could have had. Morf's book writing and also his bisexuality, wich felt like it was put there more in a way to score points, and John Malkovich character's career.

294,FredOnFilm,'Two movies merged into one',7,4 February 2019,"Morph Vandewalt (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cynical art critic who after the discovery of a series of haunting paintings, slowly begins to unravel mysterious secrets that lie beneath the murky waters of the art industry. The latest in a line of high profile Netflix original movies, Velvet Buzzsaw is a showcase of talented performers, with the likes of Rene Russo, Toni Collette and John Malkovich directed by Dan Gilroy, the mastermind behind Nightcrawler. It soon becomes clear that the paintings, which belonged to a recently deceased mysterious artist, are clearly of significant value. As the story progresses, they awake a supernatural force which sets out to enact revenge on an industry that has fallen to greed and cynicism. Velvet Buzzsaw is both an intellectual and fascinating watch, but ultimately turns out to be another case of style over substance.Velvet Buzzsaw is essentially two movies merged into one. On one hand you have a dark comedy that focuses on a cynical portrayal of the art industry. On the other you have a horror/thriller flick that features art exhibitions and paintings coming to life. For me, the horror elements of Velvet Buzzsaw were a disappointment. These scenes felt very cliché and it became clear that executing horror is not one of the director's strengths. I was absolutely furious when a particularly tense scene led to a character being startled by a cat. Despite the horror shortcomings, Gilroy has a talent for crafting intriguing characters that are used to underline a social commentary, and for the most part, this film demonstrates that in abundance. He clearly has a flair for bringing out tremendous performances from an already talented cast. Collette, Malkovich and Zawe Ashton are fantastic additions, but it's really Gyllenhaal and Russo who stand head and shoulders above the rest. Gyllenhaal is just so effective at portraying slightly mentally unhinged characters and this film really demonstrates his versatility as an actor where he is able to shift emotional states from scene to scene. I enjoyed watching Morph attend a funeral, unable to resist his urges to critique every single perceived fault with the service. There are number of these darkly comical moments, all of which I felt worked well.Despite all of its fun quirks and thought-provoking concepts, the film unfortunately falls flat in its weak narrative and lack of any real payoff to the story. If you have seen the trailer for Velvet Buzzsaw then you have essentially seen this film. The narrative stumbles at around the half-way mark and I was left feeling a little let down by the direction of the story and the lack of any real surprises. Dan Gilroy remains a talented writer/director and he has here once again crafted a stylish production with clear satirical undertones. If you are already a Netflix subscriber (or have a brother-in-law who pays for it for you), then I would definitely recommend checking out Velvet Buzzsaw, if only for its talented cast and snappy dialogue.FredOnFilm Movie Rating: B -Visit the FredOnFilm movie blog for all the latest news, reviews and discussion in the world of cinema .",Velvet Buzzsaw

My expectations were quite high after watching Nightcrawler a movie in which starred Gyllenhaal and was directed by Gilroy and this movie had the same actor-director combination. Gyllenhaal like always was phenomenal in this role, his and Toni Colette's performances were the best even though Colette didn't have a big role in the movie. Rest of the performances were ok not anything special. This certainly looks like a Gilroy movie, I loved the visual style and some scenes were shot to perfection. Now the negatives, firstly, it has all the horror cliches we've come to expect like fakescares, characters making horrible decisions and a cliche ending although ironically one aspect of the ending was unexpected. Secondly, I hate how some subplots were introduced towards the end and were never resolved or even mentioned later. Thirdly, the movie can't find a balance between horror and comedy, I found some scenes to be emotionally confusing i.e should I be laughing or be scared. In conclusion, the movie was a mixed bag, with things that work and things that don't in the end, the positives are more than the negative so I'll give the movie a ""C+"" or a 6.5/10.",Velvet Buzzsaw

A film that lets performers like Renée Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal out of their casting boxesand into the radical freedom of making a character where box-office promise is irrelevant.. I can't imagine wanting to see it twice. So I felt about films of Olivier Assayas and Spike Lee and Richard Linklater on first viewing.

These are great actors, and we know this is a great writer / director, I'm not sure where the movie went wrong.Interestingly enough the movie does feel like it's bad in a very similar way to The Cloverfield Paradox, as both movies are rushed and inconsequential and feel as though they're setting up an inexplicable mystery which is never explained properly. Maybe it's because of Netflix, I'd imagine this could be due to time constraints of mandates involving what events should happen at certain points in the film. Either way this was a major disappointment and I hope in the future Dan Gilroy is able to make something that shows off his talent more.",Velvet Buzzsaw

Of course, I agree that there were flaws in the film, I personally didn't like the rough editing in the second half of the film and the tightness of the moments.
I really liked the aesthetics of the film - at the highest level, like the atmosphere of the film itself - a complete immersion in the story.

318,tzuuuUUUU,EASILY one of the worst movies of 2019,2,21 February 2019,"2019 has just started and already, here we have one of the worst movies of the year.I guess they wanted to show the ""dark side"" of the world of art, but was it very exciting, intriguing or thrilling? No, it was actually really boring. Except the occasional ""horror/death scenes"", they just keep talking and talking and talking, and you don't really care about any of it. This is the type of movie, that if even the main character dies, you feel absolutely nothing. NOTHING.Almost ALL characters are non-likable and one dimensional, and there is some really bad acting here, especially coming from Jake himself, who is overacting way too much. Again, you feel NOTHING for any of the characters in the movie, nothing. The horror elements? Very lukewarm and GENERIC, generic is the correct word - nothing new or interesting, underwhelming, there are low budget tv series that have death/horror scenes that leave more impact on you. The few jokes? I didn't laugh or even smile even one time.After this movie ended me and my girlfriend were just sitting there, completely silent. It drained our souls. This movie is really disappointing and everything it tries to do ends up being either lukewarm or simply boring, story is not interesting, underwhelming horror elements/death scenes, weak flat characters, pointless, boring, lazy, filler type of movie.EASILY one of the worst movies of 2019",Velvet Buzzsaw

It doesn't help that after the discovery of the cache of mystery paintings, the plot becomes very predictable; with nothing approaching any kind of twist. It's an interesting depiction of what I can only assume is the vacuous world of high art dealers, critics and their artists in LA, but as a result, Jake G's character aside, we have a collection of highly unpleasant characters, who we neither root for nor care for when their inevitable demise occurs.",Velvet Buzzsaw

The idea and set up of the film are great and I think that it could have been a great film, but nothing was developed properly and it was quite disappointing that there wasn't this amazing end to it that I had hoped for. Then there was an imbalance between amazing acting and horrific acting, some of the characters completely lacked based on how two dimensional the acting was, even though some of the stiff facial expressions seemed like they might have been intentional to showcase lack of emotion in an industry that was based off emotion, it was not executed correctly. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from watching this unless they are looking for a little more dept in a film.",Velvet Buzzsaw
323,jcruz-42957,Velvet Buzzsaw: 7.4,7,28 April 2019,"Following Dan Gilroy's recurrent themes of how an aspect of society has become perverted, Velvet Buzzsaw is an effective addition. Like Nightcrawler and Roman J. Isreal Esq. it has something to say and says it brilliantly. Avoiding characters outright explaining what the movie has to say at the end, it does what a good film with a message should, send the message with implication, and not monologues. It showcases characters who don't know which side of the line of authenticity they're on, in an art world where the money is more important than the art, hence how the industry has become perverted. But watching these inauthentic and greedy people is for some reason hilariously engaging. Watching these characters boil over the most petty aspects of life in high class society is comedic in itself, but you still understand where they come from. Obviously, out of the cast Jake Gyllenhaal stands out, and solidly embodies the most interesting character in the story. Although it's smart in its themes and characters, it occasionally falls into the cliches that comes with the genre that it's in, when its time for the horror aspect of the story. And the closer the movie comes to its ending the more the narrative splinters in too many directions, and offers little explanation. But the movie is (mostly) satisfying. Overall, Velvet Buzzsaw is a cliched horror with something to say, and says it with effortless ease. So I give it a 7.4.",Velvet Buzzsaw

327,mifsudm-75748,FULL MOVIE BREAKDOWN,5,2 February 2019,"BREAKDOWN:Writing: Velvet Buzzsaw struggles to find motivation. Although it may be hidden under the pile of obscurity it creates, it is seemingly not there. There is no rhyme or reason why the characters that die are the ones that die. If this is the case of the ""no motivation killer"" such as 'Halloween' then perhaps not enough characters died. Some characters are left in the end to live and you are left wondering why and how they fit into the puzzle besides relationships to other characters. And speaking of the character relationships, most of them in this film have no purpose and are there to give a bit more life to the characters. They in no way fit into the plot and just make the film feel like 'Sex and the City'. 4/10Performances: With the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Toni Collette, how could this film not have good acting? Gyllenhaal's mental breakdown and degradation are some of the high points in the movie. I only wish we had seen more Toni Collette and John Malkovich in the overall impact of the story. 7/10Cinematography: The cinematography is uninspiring and nothing flashy. It only serves to show us directly what is on the screen (until the end when the frame replicates something we've seen before). Also, in some scenes, the cinematography does not fit the tone of the scene itself. 4/10Editing: The editing is choppy in some places. Some cut choices were unideal, in my opinion. But besides that, also nothing special. 4/10Visual Effects: The VFX is one of the highlights of the films. Some of the killings are done in beautiful ways that make the film not boring to watch. 8/10Enjoyment: 'Velvet Buzzsaw' is mostly not boring. The relationships, although tacky, give us something to pay attention to during the key moments of the story. The horror elements are also well-done, minus some pointless jumpscares. Also, it was great finally seeing a bisexual main character in a movie. 6/10Musical Score: The score is beautiful in some moments and fuses well with the imagery. However, early on in the film, there were moments where the music absolutely did not fit what was happening on-screen. 4/10Sound Mixing: Just like the cinematography and editing, there was nothing flashy here. Although, there is one scene where the sound mixing is implemented cleverly to scare a character, but misses on scaring the audience. 6/10Production Design: The scenes are beautifully crafted, which is especially important for a film about artists and art. 8/10Summary: 'Velvet Buzzsaw' is an enjoyable movie for its larger moments, but fails at providing a story that truly satisfies audiences' cravings. It gives us too much with the characters and not enough with the world. 5/10",Velvet Buzzsaw
328,monacodanielle,Took me 5 tries to watch this all the way through...,3,6 February 2019,"And holy crap, it was NOT worth it. I get what the film was trying to say but didn't like how it was said. There were some good ideas mixed in -- the critique of the art world and the mystery around the artist and his art -- but it all could have been done so much better. I normally love satire and elements of horror mixed with dark comedy, but I was incredibly disappointed, underwhelmed, and bored with this film. I thought that because the cast was great (sans the actress that played Josephina) and the trailer made it look a hell of a lot more interesting than it actually was, it would be right up my alley. Wrong. The ending of this was especially terrible. I chuckled and rolled my eyes, ""while my boyfriend said, why did you even put this back on?

The concept of a psychological thriller about cursed paintings inked in human blood should produce a good horror movie but when your horror movie is fifteen percent horror and eight five percent spitting on the pretentious art scene it comes off less as scary and more confrontational. The movies vitriolic anger against the art scene goes as far as to include a mustached art broker who shows up to act sleazy for a bit, confuse literal garbage for modern art, and then get hung by his own neckerchief. The only person who feels at home is John Malkovich but he's really only playing the kind of character everyone thinks John Malkovich is, an angry old man.

343,lempkecoleton,"Maybe the biggest waste of time, money, and talent ever",3,3 February 2019,"I can't figure out how to describe how awful this is. As far as attempting to be entertaining I'm not sure anyone has ever failed more miserably. This was singlehandedly the biggest waste of time I've personally invested in watching a movie, and that's saying a lot given some of the movies I've seen. How many more Netflix Original flops can they put out before they stop trying? This was not exciting, it didn't keep you invested, it definitely wasn't scary, and I didn't give a hoot about a single character in the entire movie.Velvet Buzzsaw attempts to create an in depth portrayal of modern art society where we're introduced to an intertwining web of characters who all share different relationships. Aside from their personal relationships they are tied together via their various business relationships in the art world as well. These relationships become more intertwined upon the discovery of an unknown artists work name Dease. Throughout the film a sinister supernatural attachment to the art begins to dispose of these characters who would seek to exploit this work for their own personal profit. In less words it can be described as the biggest snooze fest in recent history. About 30 minutes of the almost 2 hours of runtime serves any purpose aside from satirical stereotypes regarding people who make up these high end modern art communities. I'm by no mean offended by these stereotypes, rather bored to death by their monumental lack of substance. The death scenes aren't scary, there's no tension throughout the movie at all, and the story arc could be better described as a very, very shallow story plateau. The special effects look cheap, and ingenuine, and this doesn't help add any tension or fear to what's meant to be scary. And do I even need to mention the Goliath sized plot holes that have become a staple of Netflix Originals at this point?The one thing this movie has is loads of talent, aside from Zawe Ashton who played Josephina. I could walk outside, throw a rock, and it would land next to someone who could do as well, if not better than Zawe. Aside from that, Jake Gyllenhaal, Renee Russo, Toni Collette, and even Natalie Dyer show just how well they can truly act. Even in a movie that fails to be any sort of good their talent manages to shine. It's a shame this talent was wasted on an utterly empty story. People who disagree with me will say I didn't understand, or couldn't appreciate the point the movie sought out to make. I understand this film seeks to illustrate that the reduction of art in this society to nickels and dimes ultimately hurts art as a whole, and in turn the people who committed this crime against Dease's work were hurt back. Frankly, I just don't care. If you want the audience to care about this point the film has to be powerful, gripping, or at the very least exciting. This movie is nothing but boring.Save yourself two hours and pick something else on your watchlist. Take my word that you truly aren't missing anything with seeing. If you choose to ignore this advice I personally guarantee you'll contemplate turning it off before the 40 minute mark. If I didn't set out to make this review I would've turned it off on about 3 separate occasions.

There are plenty off beautiful scenes and art and I am really trying to figure out why there were so many shots of eyes I am positive I'm missing something from that and that's why I feel it wont be received well. it has a sense of wonder about it and people today don't like that, they want everything force feed.

346,maclayi,Velvet Buzzsaw & The Sacred,7,27 May 2020,"VB is a psychological-thriller & horror film about several people in the art industry who come upon a collection of paintings created by a man who had recently passed and ominously demanded that the paintings be burned. Various characters had different responses as to what to do with his work but eventually decided to sell them. Most of these art critics and dealers all throughout the film, in just about every way one could, express a blatant disregard for anyone or anything but themselves even blatantly stating at one point that there is no higher power to be afraid of, to stop them from pursuing climbing the pyramid of wealth & fame at all costs. It's this arrogant self-deification that provides them with the gall to sell these paintings despite the wishes of the dead man who created them. As a result each person profiting from the sale of these paintings is brutally murdered by the ghosts that have possessed the paintings.The content of VB felt reminiscent of the Exodus story of the ten plagues or when the ark of the covenant was neglected or mishandled and people were plagued to death due to neglecting deemed sacred. Much like religion, art shares much of that same quality and so it's easy to use to critique the all commodifiying markets that step on everything, even sacred things, for the endless pursuit of profit at all costs.VB drove the point it wanted to across very clearly. The acting, especially on Jake Gyllenhaal's part, and visual effects were enjoyable. If I were more into horror and if it managed to either say more or develop more fleshed out characters I would watch it again. It was a chill-invoking one time watch that delivered a critique of society that needed to take on cinematic form and so I am glad Dan Gilroy and company decided to create it.",Velvet Buzzsaw

The story feels familiar yet new, you don't see the turns. Very nice.Characters/actors: excellent casting. as always Moore and Gyllenhaal delivers the goods. The movie wouldn't have worked without them. The characters are sort of a satire of people deep into the art industry. Their interactions are hillarious.Direction: This is not a very daring style but impressive in a sense. If you would've read the script I don't think many people would know how to realize it. The lines are so weird but it workes somehow. Good actor directing but the rest is standard which is not bad by the way.Script: The film explores the art world and art's value. The found paintings where not ment to be found and it's after they're sold the horror begins. A character once says ""what's the point of art if no one sees it?"". This is further explored in the film. The script is the most daring i'd say. The bulls*it the characters spout when looking at the paintings is so funny. The obsession with intellect and prestige, even when having sex, is too absurd to stop watching.Visuals: The vfx are very creative. I was hooked by the beautifully drawn intro sequence. There is a death scene (no spolier) where the poured out color on the floor starts soaking up in to a persons skin. The cinematography is passable. It's netflix trademark cinematography so to say. Standard focal length, even lit, smooth surfaces and crisp resolution. The opposite of Se7en if you get what I mean.The expecations of a netflix produced Gillroy, Gyllenhaal and Moore film was mixed. All three of them knocked it out of the park in Nightcrawler (2014). When it comes to netflixes record of produced films you can't say they're incompentent, rather they lack a sense of honesty, bravery and grittiness.
There have been films produced where netflix have left the creative work to the creators and there have been films where netflixes fingerprints is all over them. In the case of, let's say Roma, you see the directors vision louder than netflix. In the case of Velvet Buzzsaw the result was mixed.I urge Netflix to let the directors and screenwriters do their thing.",Velvet Buzzsaw

When I was studying art at university I used to drag my then wife to galleries and openings. (She dragged me to a lot of student theatre so fair is fair!) As a joke if I saw she was getting bored, I would go off on Art-Speak cribbing from the long winded and mostly BS reviews I read in art magazines. She got a giggle out of it and that was all I cared about. After doing it for a while I noticed that people around me stopped talking and were listening.

357,paul-stableford-720-888180,Pretentious art horror or horror about pretentious art?,7,3 February 2019,"This is is a difficult one, as a horror it falls short, not suspenseful enough to raise any nagging doubts in our minds or not shocking enough to make us jump or grab the nearest pillow to hide behind.The cast is impressive if not all totally committed to the project, Toni Collette throws herself in with the usual verve and Rene Russo also puts in a good performance, Malkovich is somewhat underused and doesn't show nearly as much enthusiasm as his other recent Netflix outing Birdbox.The standout for me was Gyllenhaal, camp as a row of tents and yet believable as a man confused by his feelings for a female friend/lover and caught in turmoil over the unexplained horrific deaths that start to take over his world.I personally found the film more of a curio, one which could either be relegated to the horror also rans or be mentioned by the likes of Kermode as a reference point in future genre documentaries.The basic premise is not one that needs analysing past it's blurb, poncy art types being generally loathsome, mystery spooky artist dies, spooky artist's work found by wannabe poncy art type, poncy art types die trying to exploit dead artist's work.Whilst I cannot categorise this as a horror per se I would struggle to place in any other category, that for me is a disappointment as whilst not every film can be be placed neatly into boxes I was hoping for more of anything that could let me file this away, instead what I was left with was a feeling of malaise and a wondering of what might have been.",Velvet Buzzsaw
358,aodhanmulholland14,What did I just watch? Terrible movie.,3,1 February 2019,Honestly Dan Gilroy what was that?? Terrible story full of unlikable characters. This is the worst film I have seen in 2019. It is supposed to be a horror/thriller with poor horror and no thrills. It's safe to say this film is no peice of art.,Velvet Buzzsaw
359,That_Seventies_Guy,"""Art is Dangerous""",7,11 February 2019,"Art. Art is life is art is complicated is art is... It's existed from the first footprints we as humans left in the sand. It encapsulates our culture and behaves as a total entity and form of energy that changes, and changes the open mind. It's existence is transcendent and can be so in various instances within itself. This fact, makes the art forms about art very intriguing and cerebral, and most assuredly will offer something for anyone willing to partake. One such example of this, in every respect stated thus, is the new motion picture, compellingly titled ""Velvet Buzzsaw"" from Netflix and written/Directed by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler).
The film, which opens this weekend, is a psychological horror/thriller of high intellectual proportions; It's intelligent, crafty and unlike most of it's peers, manages to act as an adult horror movie while also giving it's audiences something to think about. The story is a full-blown ensemble adagio, surrounding a community of art enthusiasts who come in to some form of connection with a collection of art from a recently deceased hermit, named Dease. Those who come in to it's orbit, soon start to experience their lives taking a menacing turn. Writer/Director Gilroy gives the audience his trademark anti-ageist casting of wife Rene Russo, stellar as always, the role of a feisty, strong and driven female of her certain age, and still allows her to be seen as sexy, vibrant, and relevant, while pairing her with her Nightcrawler co-star Jake Gyllenhaal (who also does a great job) as a sexually confused art Critic. They are joined in great unison by Toni Collette - in a fierce turn - who steals every scene she's in as a zesty, and social art agent, Zawe Ashton, who gives a harrowing performance as an opportunistic young woman, drawn to the financial benefits of dealing art, and in a touching, humane performance, John Malkovich as the conscientious but tortured artist himself. All characters are creatively woven together in a regime that is both unique and old fashioned (think Robert Altman). Other top notch performers of note include Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things), Daveed Diggs (The Get Down), and Tom Sturridge.
Gilroy's story acts as an existential look at good art versus bad art, examining if there is even a difference, how it affects us as human beings, and pleads with the audience to decide whether or not the characters infatuation with a dead man's art, infatuation or a portal to their own greed, should be equivocally mandated to the audiences' own desires and expectations from the very film they are viewing, or the art of film itself. With dialogue that is quicker and wittier than the speed of sound riding the speed of light, and a musical score by noted genre composer Marco Beltrami (the Scream series) that gleefully winks at it's listeners, the film delivers a unique and ultimately satisfying thrill ride into the human psyche. It's riddled with ""blink and you'll miss it"" nuances and fashionista references in apparel and glamour, which causes the film to emanate an atmosphere akin to that of Irvin Kirshner's Eyes of Laura Mars, or Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill.
The execution of the material, for the most part works. We get an idea of what's going on, with just enough inference to keep us postulating and are always kept one step ahead of the story. In fact, Gilroy's focus on his direction of the actors and their main action is so sharp, it distracts from background elements that might have been better explained if they'd been paid better attention to. In addition, the scrutiny of Gyllenhaal's character, and his sexual nature, could have been explored and parlayed more than seemed upon first viewing. However, Gilroy is a filmmaker with his mind on the matter, and as the film boasts such a farcical sense of humor, it's hard to allow any shortcomings to deter from enjoyment. In addition, Further viewings of the film may prove beneficial, as there seemed to be hidden gems that give a clue to what's really going on, popping up throughout the film. The overall purpose is accomplished - a very foreboding sense of danger is created. Juxtaposed against the art scene of Los Angeles - to which Gilroy uses to extremely marvelous effect (as usual) - is chic and slick, and were the film produced even ten years ago, might've created a catholic effect on cinema culture and might've been hailed so, for it's merits. It was refreshing to see only one backer in the opening credits (Netflix), and with any luck the film will catch on and find the audience it was intended for.
Regardless, the film is certainly a bold one, that will fascinate it's viewers. With an echo of earlier genre classics as Bernard Rose's Candyman or Hideo Nakata's Ringu, spiced with a sly sense of humor, Buzzsaw Velvet is a piece of art that should affect a core audience who will return to it for further reference.",Velvet Buzzsaw
360,ian_tully,"Disappointed I sat through this, poor plot, underdeveloped story & characters.",2,2 February 2019,"After watching Nightcrawler I was really looking forward to this film and Netflix promoted the hell out of it. unfortunately this is a car crash in comparison.Ill start with the very few pros I enjoyed. I liked the set design, the paintings shown throughout the film were great, The mannequin artwork (American Hobo) on crutches looked terrifying. There were some decent camera shots, but also some terrible (mental hospital flashback).Now the cons. The characters are overly stereotyped to the point it looked like a spoof thriller. There was no depth to any of the characters, I found it hard to feel for the characters or to gain any emotional connection. The storyline felt underdeveloped, uninteresting, and it didn't give much insight into the villain of the film (dead artist spirit), this back story was too thin. The mental hospital flashback felt like something from a B-Movie that I have seen 100 times before, as did the Petrol station and Zawe Ashton death scene. Some actors or casting were terrible, Zawe Ashton & Billy Magnussen annoyed me to watch. I felt the movie had conflicts in its styling. At times it felt cheap and mainstream while it also tried to incorporate art house film styles as well. The two styles caused the finished product to be a film that does not know what it wants to be.Overall I feel the visuals and casting of Jake Gyllenhaal,John Malkovich & Rene Russo carried this film. I had high expectations but left feeling I had wasted my time. I wouldn't recommend this, unless your looking for a few interesting painting ideas.'The Square' by Ruben Östlund is a movie which does a great job depicting the elitist art world in a much less stereotypical light while also poking complete fun at it. Dan Gilroy should have taken a similar approach.",Velvet Buzzsaw
361,alirat,Art for art's sake,6,8 February 2019,"I liked Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, the character rang true. That is about the only positive thing I can say, except that thef horror and tension were well paced and a good dramatic ending.What really annoyed me and spoiled the movie was the truly awful artwork! Really? They were gooing ang gahing over that? I guess it is a big ask to get some actually good pieces to play what was essentially the central role. Some, like all the hands, and the large grey piece hung in Rhodona's home weren't bad, but the children in the desert by the fire... ? Ugh. The family hunched over a fire at night, equally bad.

his usual stellar self, but his screen time was seriously lacking. Velvet Buzzsaw is a very promising film but it's wild fluctuations in tone and awkward integration of the horror elements ultimately sentence the film to failure.VB works excellently as a tongue in cheek assassination of the hollow arrogance of the contemporary art world. The concept of art causing death & devastation didn't need to be so literal. Grounded explorations of the danger of obsession are often much more effective. The film really devolves into a sort of art themed version of Final Destination.There is no lasting message & no protagonist.

A unknown painter new to the business and a peek into the world of art and all it intrigues. This was by far the best about the movie.

370,bdevmalya,Beauty of Gyllenhal.....,6,31 March 2019,"Writing about a movie which satirizes the review writing process seems a bit self-cannibalistic in nature but Jake Gyllenhaal's Morf Vandelwalt is pretentious, shallow and condescending character just needs to be written about. In this high art themed psychological horror from the director who created that beautifully unnerving movie called Nightcrawler, the LA art scene is shown in a bare naked sense with a life full of beauty, fashion, sex and luxury. Velvet Buzzsaw combines two of the more clichéd traits of art world namely a tortured artist and posthumous success, and adds a bit of self-parody with a pinch of predictable yet stylish horror.Dan Gilroy has in his past movies tried to portray the lack of apathy the modern life is built around and he has never been less subtle than the ""sphere"" murder scene where a bloody body is assumed to be a part of the exhibition with school children walking in the pool of blood and adults praising the originality of the art. In another scene oozing with pitch-black comedy, an art connoisseur mistakenly thinks of pile of garbage as a new gorgeous creation by a reclusive artist played by John Malkovich, whose dead pan delivery makes the scene hit hard.The story revolves around an ensemble of characters which include all the usual suspects one would find in a movie related to art world such as gallery owner, art critic, independent agents, artists (both alive and dead) and the paintings themselves. The movie switches between a satire and a creepy art-coming-alive chiller with utmost ease except the last act where it becomes like Final Destination filled with imaginative deaths and a killer automaton. As it happened, the art gallery assistant stumbles across a dead artist's apartment chock-full with paintings which are ""mesmerizing and enthralling"" according to Morf. This is her key to get-rich soon and she follows on it but there is a small catch. The dead painter has somehow cursed the paintings so that everyone who will come in contact will die a gory death and there is no turning it back.Jake Gyllenhaal has created magic with this character and it shows in every scene he is in. He is a man infatuated with beauty and exquisiteness and is not shy to offer accolades to his girlfriend's skin (""the most beautiful cross between almond and saddle brown"") ,neither is he afraid to throw disdain ("" A bad review is better than sinking into the great glut of anonymity"") . He comments on the aesthetics of a coffin at a funeral with such aplomb contempt, it is hilarious to watch. Rest of the cast is also dynamite with Rene Russo, Toni Collette and John Malkovich shining.The movie would have been more engrossing if the black humor would have been at the forefront till the end and the horror placed in the attic like a bad painting.",Velvet Buzzsaw

373,yyero,"Just terrible, nothing like Nightcrawler",4,12 February 2019,"This movie is just...terrible. You will probably see it anyway because it has Jake Gyllenhaal in it but that's about it, you will eventually either say it was okay or regret you picked it at all the first place. Maybe a good background movie while you pull a move on your date and hopefully all of you can forget is even on in the first place.The movie has some interest in it with a good cast however after an hour into it you will realize thats all it is, nothing of substance ever happens. Plots are all over the place, personal stories do not have background to them. For example you are just given already established characters to feel for with ZERO background whatsoever, they give you hints as the movie progresses but essentially the movie does NOTHING to make you feel for any of them or say this is the lead character.
Every horror movie needs a lead, this movie can't even come up with that.
At first you would think Jake Gyllenhaal is the main protagonist but nope, he isn't and is a shame because he was the only one that got somewhat of depth in character development.OH BTW talking about cameos, John Malkovich makes an appearance in this movie TO DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. When I mean he does nothing, he literally DOES NOTHING it was so weird!! It's like he just wanted to say hi 3 times and get a paycheck! So confusing so unecessary, so...bad. The man appears about 3 times on camera to do NOTHING for the story, provides zero to the story or has zero impact on the movie, outcome, progression ANYTHING.
TO smack you further in the face IT ENDS WITH HIM JUST DRAWING ON A BEACH when he never even SAW THE MONSTER. IN fact he was the only one in the whole damn movie that seemed oblivious to the entity killing people and had zero camera time yet the movie ended it with him anyway.
Please dont watch this, if you want to sit for 1 hour and 55 minutes to see every notable character with zero development die under 5 mins to then have a meaningless ending where the monster never has any explanation, background or conclusion with a character that has zero relevancy to the plot is just absurd.
I have no idea why they made this movie, this has zero to do with night crawlers, remotely nowhere near the same plot/cohesion or interest/cliffhangers
to advertised it anywhere near it is to sully that movies name.AVOID.",Velvet Buzzsaw
374,ndongreus,A Rise of An Artsy Ghost (Or Ghosty Artist?),5,4 February 2019,"Generally, I love this rare theme that they try to depict in the screen. Telling about some haunted paintings that left behind by the artist because of his death, and later it can be known that the paintings are, somehow, cursed. If you're interested in horror and mystical stuff, then you're probably aware that, in reality, there are some haunted paintings that, people said, it bring lots of disasters that passed down to the next owner. This film tried to picture this rare phenomenon with promising trailer and actors. However, their storyline isn't as strong as Jake Gyllenhaal's impressive performance: stretch it out in the front and squeeze them out later. I don't get the ""terrified and scared"" feeling even though I watched it at night, so that makes me think it will be better to not label it as a horror movie. They have to describe the artist deeper: about his previous life, what's the reason behind using his own blood beneath the oil color, what's the meaning of each painting and its correlation with his life, etc. Some things that I appreciate so much are Jake's impressive acting and the way they kill Rhodora (Yes, that's my favorite scene from this film).

The acting is sub-par too. And there are some great actors here, but it doesn't feel like they're giving it their all, the performances fell flat, and the characters were one dimensional.None of the actors have any chemistry together, they feel stiff and disjointed.It could have been a really clever film with deep themes or satirical take on the pretentiousness of the art world, but it turned into a generic supernatural horror which could have been just as easily achieved with a B rated cast and budget.Such a waste of talent on this drivel.

The direction is solid, but nothing special or noteworthy, the same can be said for the cinematography and shot composition. The music is horrendous, and at certain points a better score could have heightened the scene immensely. The color palate does very little to suggest a horror film, but this is merely a preference of style regarding the genre over a genuine criticism. The story is fine, various themes are present and displayed visually and metaphorically throughout in creative ways, but none of this outdoes a lack of investment in the characters or scares. The biggest problem with the movie is that at absolutely no point is it even close to frightening. To put things in the simplest of terms, the trailer for the film is better than the actual movie. 4/10, boi",Velvet Buzzsaw

It never once lived up to the potential of the story, which makes more sense in the trailer than the film. It was a great concept never realized. The actors are good, but that doesn't really get you anywhere. Secondary, superfluous stories dominate screen time, and they are too thinly connected to the main story to be anything but annoying. I suspect there is some grand moral to the story here, and it may be that symbolism was selected over entertainment and cohesiveness. Whatever was attempted, it flops.",Velvet Buzzsaw

This film tells the story of a high brow art scene, and the key figures driving it. These characters, soaking in pretension, are immediately shown to wear their motives right on the sleeve. In this film, it's far too often that through dialogue, we're able to immediately gauge a character's ambitions, desires, and vices. This on-the-nose style strips so much intrigue and ambiguity from its tense set up about the discovery of remarkable paintings made by a late troubled recluse. This coupled with unpleasantly hammy performances from most of the stars gives Velvet Buzzsaw a shallow B movie aesthetic. This does at least let Jake Gyllenhaal's character acting chops display immaculately. Whenever a scene tries to set up a jump scare, I get bored and hope Gyllenhaal will be back soon with some more gleefully egotistical banter.",Velvet Buzzsaw

A strong cast carries this film and makes an otherwise straightforward plot pretty interesting. However this film certainly won't scare anybody outside of small children and those sensitive to some mild blood/gore. The few kills in the film deliver in very interesting methods, but unfortunately they are just that...few.

I knew I was in for a treat when I first learned that the cast and director/writer for Nightcrawler were reuniting for the new film Velvet Buzzsaw, but I'm still so pleasantly surprised that I wasn't let down in the slightest. The acting was spot on, no questions there. The entire cast was A+. And I really do love me some Jake Gyllenhaal in a quirky role. He's truly honed his craft so well over the last decade. And him alongside greats like John Malkovich, Rene Russo, and Toni Collette... so much yes. The writing was fantastic; it was oozing with dry sardonic wit through and through. I f*ng love that stuff. It has a perfect mix of many genres including satire, noir, psychological thriller, horror, and that 'uneasy-weird-twisted' feeling that director Dan Gilroy is so good at. I truly hope he stays on this upward trajectory as he's still in his fledgling period as a director. Yes, it leaves you with questions at the end. Yes, a lot of it doesn't make much sense. But this is where I'd compare it as the right way to do that, as opposed to say, Birdbox. The characters were totally unlikable in this movie, but they were supposed to be. They were short sighted money hungry narcissists. You aren't supposed to empathize with them. Any stupid action is taken purely out of selfishness and I think that if there is a message at all in this one, that was it. It isn't getting as great reviews as I would've liked, but hey, I liked it and that's what matters. I was totally engrossed in it from start to finish. Take that as you will.

The idea was reasonable and could have made for a terrifying feature, but the constant draw for suspense ruined the film. There was no beginning, there was no ark, and the end answered no questions.

427,tommy-trull,Velvet Buzzsaw - 'all art is dangerous ...',10,5 February 2019,"Dan Gilroy's VELVET BUZZSAW is an extraordinary film. It's a horror film that takes its cues from BASQUIAT, and an intellectual art film that takes its cues from IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS. Working from his own screenplay, Gilroy tells the story of a group of art world movers and shakers who are profoundly and disastrously affected by the discovery of a deceased outsider artist named Ventril Dease.From its stylish opening credits, the film establishes itself as an intensely visual experience. Some of the art openings involve long, winding tracking shots that allow us to be tourists through several let's-be-nice-and-call-them-sophisticated conversations. Gilroy certainly takes a mocking attitude toward the extremes of high culture. In fact, characters mistake ordinary garbage for installation pieces on more than one occasion. Throughout the film, Robert Eswit's cinematography dazzles. (One shot in particular, in which Jake Gyllenhaal's character enters a sunlit factory, deserves an exhibit of its own.)The performances are, almost across the board, quite good. The film's marketing focuses on Jake Gyllenhaal, although it would be a mistake to call his character the protagonist. In fact, the film seems to begin with one focal character, then switches horses at the midpoint. While this rarely works, Gilroy manages to pull this off by clearly drawing each of his characters: Rhodora (Rene Russo) is the aging queen, Morf (Gyllenhaal) is the spiritual seeker, Josephina (Zawe Ashton) is the calculating climber, Gretchen (Toni Collette) is the ruthless shapeshifter, and so on. The only performance which didn't work for me - Daveed Diggs's ""Damrish"" - wasn't a large enough or sufficiently significant part to dim my enjoyment. (I have liked Diggs very much elsewhere, but felt he was miscast here.)But the real star is the screenplay. Gilroy gives us sufficient time to soak in these characters and their world before giving us our inciting incident, which is the discovery of Ventril Dease and his work, and allows us to root for the put-upon Josephina in her decision to use this discovery as leverage. Once the core mystery (who is Ventril Dease and what is he doing to us?) is afoot, we are sucked in.Gilroy's film has a lot to say about a cluster of subjects. He shows us a world of acquirers and tastemakers, shows us the behind-the-scenes machinations of those who would determine what art lives and what art dies. Late in the film one character exclaims that 'all art is dangerous,' while another attests that 'any of us who profited are in danger.' His conclusions about the relationship between art and commerce aren't particularly surprising or controversial, but they are well-stated. Perhaps the most important thematic element, for me, occurs during the closing credits, after the main action of the film has ended: a character creates art on a canvas that is, by virtue of its own nature, temporary.Hopefully this film will reach a large audience, as this year's BIRDBOX did. I suspect it won't, and that's okay. But much like with the paintings in VELVET BUZZSAW, those who see this will absolutely find themselves changed.",Velvet Buzzsaw

452,roopej-03158,Interesting premise let down by predictable horror,6,19 February 2019,Dan Gilroys teams up again with jake Gyllenhaal but this time with far less success than 2014's nightcrawler. Velvet Buzzsaw follows a small group of the LA art world as the mysterious paintings of dease are released into the world. As seen in the trailer the paintings are able to move and even come out and grab you and here is where my issues with the film start.In my opinion in horror it's best to have some kind of rules so you know what to be scared of. Even the slightest hint of ghosts or the supernatural will do at separating horror from something more psychological. Here it's unclear as to why these paintings have these properties as everything feels like the real world and for the first act the film it balances on this in between of something psychological and actual physically alive paintings. And for the most part these horror sections are terribly predictable as soon as we see a main character alone with one of the paintings it's pretty clear as to what's gonna happen.Where the movie excels is in between these horror parts when we get more of Morf(played by gyllenhaal in scintillating form) trying to figure out what's going on while experiencing haunting visual and auditory hallucinations. This descent into paranoia and almost madness is far more engaging than the cheap thrills the film seems more eager to give us. More of these characters being entranced yet horrified by these pictures and subtle things going wrong would have made for a far creepier experience.Overall what could have been a really interesting psychological thriller ended up being a slightly above par horror movie with good performances all round and a interesting premise and while the horror elements were my least favourite part they were very creative and any horror fan would be sure to get a kick out of it,Velvet Buzzsaw

455,kathrynaegis,A clever sendup of the modern art scene,8,12 February 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is equal parts humorous satire and slasher flick, taking on the absurdities of the high end modern art gallery business.

456,EnterFilmReviews,"A great blend of horror and satire, but doesn't quite pack the punch",6,9 February 2019,"Written and Directed by Dan Gilroy, Velvet buzzsaw shows takes you on a satirical ride through the dark and twisted world of modern art.Gilroy once again teams up with Jake Gyllenhaal staring as a strange pretentious art critic. Rene Russo playing Rhodora a cut throat art gallery owner and Zawe Ashton as her 'protegee' Josefina. As well as John Malkovich as a famous idea blocked artist.Josefina finds numerous unusual pieces of artwork from her recently deceased neighbour Vetril Dease. Who upon his death willed everything to be destroyed. So naturally Josefina steals these before that can happen and eventually shares them with Rhodora and Morf to exploit this opportunity for their own gain. From this point on, things are not quite the same, these are not just your regular masterpiece.The cinematography is right off the top shelf for me. Whether that's with the camera panning through crowds of people hearing numerous conversations about the work of Dease, or subtle uses of the art reflecting within the glasses of a mesmerised Gyllenhaal.Music is something that always stands out to me in horror movies and with Velvet Buzzsaw it fit every scene perfectly, the instruments and tempo flawlessly matched the scene increasing the eeriness, particularly showcases when Josefina explores the room of Dease.Velvet Buzzsaw does not pack the punch it seemed to be building up to. I wish Gilroy had pushed the boundaries even further, it had a perfect balance between horror and satire, but I wish it went a little bit more towards the horror.Velvet Buzzsaw does provide an interesting looking into the glamorous world of the arts featuring truly exceptional performances.",Velvet Buzzsaw
457,adog-86040,Mona Lisa is scarier,2,2 February 2019,This movie was terrible. I was pumped after the trailer only to be let down and kicked in the nads. Jake killed it as he normally does. Unfortunately the plot was awful and so were the jump scares that kept this movie mildly interesting. I've experienced more thrill driving with my gas light on than watching this movie.,Velvet Buzzsaw
458,erbindkay,"If you love art, you will love this movie",9,2 February 2019,"Just like contemporary art, not everyone will understand this movie. To be sure, not every viewer will appreciate the subtle nuances and hidden homages strategically sprinkled throughout. And trying to define this slippery gem is challenging. Using generic Hollywood terms, VB is marketed as a Thriller/Horror, but I saw it more as a satirical drama within the Thriller/Horror genre. Both the IMDB rating and Meteoritic score undervalue this movie, and it is definitely worth watching if you appreciate great acting, stunning visual scenery, meaningful character dialog and an engaging sequence of events. In my opinion, the movie is more of an intellectual parody of contemporary art culture, and much less an emotional thrill ride. In other words, art itself is the hero, and the unknown artist just a MacGuffin, pursued with little narrative explanation. Characters are merely props with little arc, while sets and props become alive. That cinematic contortion, combined with the lack of real horror likely confused many viewers. If you can get past the cheesy horror affects, and enjoy parody movies with layered meaning (i.e. Eraser Head, Donnie Darko, Best in Show, Death of Stalin, Dr. Strangelove, or the first 2/3s of District-9) you can probably sit thru this one. And if you enjoy Basquiat, Hockney, Koons, Pollack or Warhol as much as Bob Ross or Thomas Kinkade, you might actually like Velvet Buzzsaw.",Velvet Buzzsaw
459,kjmarie,Decent movie if you watch with an open mind,7,4 February 2019,"There's a lot of bad reviews on here, and I think it was the satirical stereotype of the 1% that made it that way. I believe people might have been offended at it, but there is some super good acting, and a decent story if you watch a whole lot of SVU and know how to notice the silent clues. Like the artist, Dease, was in foster care after a suspicious fire that killed his daughter and his mother, but left his father alive. And you see art of a man holding a girl back from a pale grey shape, and another when a girl seems to be sitting on the lap of her father, you can gather that maybe there was sexual abuse that lead to the murders and his time at a mental institution. With some movies, you have to be open enough and patient enough to see the silent clues that directors so creatively put in the movie for us.",Velvet Buzzsaw
460,brettepictale,Velvet Buzzsaw' (2019) Review (Spoilers),6,8 March 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw is a movie that popped out of nowhere and had many people excited when first announced in January. What many thought would be an intense gripping thriller is more of a work of satire than a horror movie of any sorts. Though the movie has thriller/horror concepts and scenes it never truly feels like that's what the film is supposed to be.Before I get into more of the contents of the film, I would like to mention the animated intro at the beginning is extremely interesting and well done. The transition from animation to live action is a bit abrupt and distracting, but besides that it's notable for being an interesting way to start the film. The film follows Morph, an extremely respectable and established art critic played by Jake Gyllenhaal-which is, in my opinion, by far the best character. I very much like Gyllenhaal in this role; he exudes a level of smugness as the harsh egotistical art critic that I just adore seeing in this film. Most of the actors in this movie give good performances for what they are given to work with, but the film seems a bit inconsistent and messy at parts, something that annoyed me as the viewer is the amount of fade to blacks they had in this film, it seemed very redundant by the end of the film.Director Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler) is at the helm of this movie and many of his past techniques are shown in this movie. His follow-shots are used immensely in this film especially near the beginning of the film, which is positive for the most part besides becoming repetitive, it shows an amount of skillful filmmaking. The satire/portrayal of the fine art industry is exceptionally entertaining and is one of the parts of the film that shines. As a Student currently enrolled in an art program, a lot of the exchanges about the fine arts are scarily familiar to what it is. It is an exaggeration of certain character types in the art community, but it is enjoyable none the less. The story does have slower parts for sure in it, so some of the middle areas of the movie are extremely drawn out and frankly boring. The film seems to understand its ridiculousness and makes sure the names of the characters fit there exact demeanor (Jon Don-don, Gretchen, Morph).The concept though more satirical exposé of the ridiculous world of art then a horror film does truly hit some amazing concepts in its few horror moments and concepts. The kills/scares of Velvet Buzzsaw are, mostly, extremely creative and thought-provoking; it truly is one of the freshest concepts in the latest years of Hollywood. With all of the reboots and sequels being made today, an original concept is a rare but beautiful thing to see. Sadly, the film seems surprisingly low budget for a movie with a budget of 21 million dollars. It seemed more like a student film in certain areas, such as how the film used some technical aspects and some of the sets.The film does a great bit of foreshadowing for future kills/scares, such as very briskly revealing Rene Russo's Rhodora was in a punk-rock group named Velvet Buzzsaw, then later shows that she has a tattoo on her neck of the band's logo which later is her demise. It shows the character of Gretchen becoming infatuated with this art piece named simply ""sphere,"" later her fate coming to becoming stuck in the piece itself. This is effective storytelling, but there are parts that seem extremely rushed and just plain weird. The character of Coco played by stranger things actress Natalia Dyer is always in the wrong place at the wrong time! I don't know who cursed this girl with 18 years worth of bad luck, but oh my word. She keeps finding the dead people, like can it please not be her this time, oh nope it's her again. She across the whole film discovers the bodies of Jon Don-don, Gretchen, and morph. This girl can't catch a break! This seemed extremely repetitive in the film because she would find them then scream every time the exact same way. A plus side of the kills is you basically hate everyone and I believe that's completely intentional, the film seems to want to portray everyone as unlikable and kinda a jerk. This works awesome for the kills, but is a double-edged sword. If we don't care about the characters, we certainly just want to see them die and not talk for 75 percent of the movie. The movie takes its time with its kills and basically waits till the last 30 minutes to kill everyone off beside a few key characters such as the unlucky girl Coco. This is probably the best part of the movie. As much as I do enjoy the satirical aspect of it, I keep waiting for the horror aspects to come in, making the satire and exposition kind of a waiting line to the good stuff.Something I actually adore in this film is its color correction. It's used to give the film a more vibrant pop art feel, which is subtle, but I very much appreciate this attention to detail. It adds so much atmosphere and personality to the beginning scenes exploring the art community and industry. That said the visual effects seem a bit lower quality than I believe originally intended. The effect that for some strange reason still bothers me is the effect on the tattoo that makes final Rhodora's imminent demise. The effect seems cheaply made. It may just be me, but it seemed a lot less professional than the scenes they showed in the trailer.The end of the film seems extremely out of place and melancholy. The last five minutes do have an interesting scene where a man sells the paintings that everyone has been fussing about for five dollars, where they were selling them for thousands of dollars. It's an extremely thought-provoking scene that really caught my eye for the analogy it is placing in the scene. But overall, the ending fell completely flat for me. I felt nothing at the end, which usually means I'm indifferent about how I feel. The movie is good and had amazing concepts, but didn't follow through on my expectations of it.ProsAnimation opening

She's lifeless, and always feels out of place. She belongs to high school home made movies, at best.Unfortunately, as a big fan of Nightcrawler, I have to say this movie wasn't good at all. The premise is great, and the cast, despite Zawe Ashton, it's superb. However this cast is just wasted potential, and no one shines. This because the script is simply lazy... Like ""early 2000s teen slasher horror movie"" lazy; with gigantic plot-holes and incredibly cringy moments. In other words, 30 mins into the movie, it turns into a cheap slasher movie with a very superficial moral lesson, delivered with non-sensical death scenes with VEEERY cheap CGI effects.I was looking forward to this one but, unfortunately, I just gotta say don't bother with it.

The movie had spectacular actors that performed as good as usual ( Gyllenhaal was tremendous, Collette was a pleasure to watch, Russo did so much for her role) . However the story was weak and some lines are simply idiotic. The directing did little to fill in the plot gaps and left a lot to be desired.

The acting is good for what it is, the characters are just too shallow for a noteworthy portrayal. That's not necessarily that big of a negative point. You could argue it's a stylistic choice.
What can't be argued it that the mystery and suspense the movie builds is lost once the supernatural really gets going. If you thought the movie would stay as different as it appeared, you're in for a disappointment. The mysterious forces just visit person after person, incite paranoia in others and act just like you've seen in movie after movie. It becomes as much of a caricature of itself as the people it portrays.

The mix of long drawn out scenes that end up feeling like filler and extremely pretentious dialogue that nevers knows if it wants to be intelligent, pandering or witty (and ends up failing in all) make some scenes (especially at the beginning) almost unwatchable and tedious.Secondly, there's not a single character in the whole movie that you care about, none of them feel real, they're all dull as hell. In a ""horror"" movie, you kinda need a character to care about, and that's clearly what the director was going for but failed horribly.Thirdly, it fails at being a horror movie and a suspenseful thriller. The movie relies heavily on cheap jumpscares (ex: the cat coming out from the lamp made a loud monster noise, I don't know how this doesn't bother more people??? Like if you have to add that in, you clearly know that what you're making isn't scary) and the stock ""scary"" violin sound. The score during the ""scary"" scenes is just some generic horror movie music, nothing special.As far as things I liked, they're few and far between. I liked the hoboman design and I liked when he was chasing Jake Gyllenhaal at the end (that was the only genuinely scary scene in the movie). I loved the opening credits, they're very well animated and visually appealing, they really get you excited for the film (or set up for disappointment depending on how you think about it). Some shots were visually appealing and stood out (like the spraypainted walls and when Jake's love interest lady gets killed and there's the paint going up her leg and stuff, truly beautiful), and John Malkovitch does an amazing job as usual playing a old man who's sick of people's garbage.
5/10, wasted potential, watch another Jake Gyllenhaal movie instead.",Velvet Buzzsaw

The sense of humor in the movie was still hot from the press, as in as fresh as can be. I feel this will come to be a classic in its own right. Just like Hellrasier is. This will be the film that I recommend to anyone who asks for weeks to come.",Velvet Buzzsaw

512,theigloodude,How can this be taken seriously,3,5 February 2019,The first act set up a plot that I found legitimately interesting. Something out of a Black Mirror universe where art has the power to kill people. But how this concept is executed in the film is extremely underwhelming and by the third act I was honestly laughing at how they concluded the movie. The only redeemable qualities are some creative digs at the pompousness and strange self-obsessed nature of the art world and great performances from Jake Gylenhaal and Rene Russo. This movie will not be taken seriously by any serious fan of thriller/horror films.,Velvet Buzzsaw

I trusted them to get into it but started getting truly flustered when at 11 minutes remaining the *same* stuff was happening on screen from the last hour. The ending was...uhm. You could've stopped the movie at any point in its runtime and you would've missed NOTHING of note.It felt like a Final Destination movie set in the art world, with the sole focus on making creative death scenes...and that's it. No rhyme or reason, just unnecessary things happening to lengthen the movie.Maybe there's some pretentious point to it, but I'm not going to waste more time looking for it. 3 stars for Jake Gyllenhall making the best of the situation surrounded by confused characters.

I'll watch this endless amounts of times, just like Roman J. and Nightcrawler, although I think his directional debut is still his best work.I hope you (yes you!) enjoy it as well and find a lot to think about just like I always do with these thought-provoking and artistically pleasing films.",Velvet Buzzsaw

You get the feeling the janitor character pretty much has surgically attached the AirPods to his ears.

So Velvet Buzzsaw is Original and that in itself is warrant a watch. Both pretentious and elegant, Velvet is somewhat on the classy side of horror.I guess the story is simple enough. Set in a world of Art, money, fakenes and critics, Velvet Buzzsaw tells the story of discovered art left by a dead man. When his paintings are stolen by folks in the 'biz' and go up for sale, a supernatural entity murders anyone who profited from his work. It's a cool idea, a nice change from the norm. The cast was fantastic, with our friend Mr Jake Gyllenhaal playing Morf, a troubled bisexual art critic being the stand out. Again he proves that he can do anything. An legend in the making, the next DiCaprio even but hey enough of the boy crush right?? The rest of the cast was fantastic, each playing their role to a T. Zawa Aston who played Josephina played a real b word out of greed and I hated her. Great job haha.The cinematography was beautiful, from the colours to the camera angles to the CGI, everything blended well. The moving art scenes where the painting moved etc where just awesome. And that soundtrack....👍So much had me loving it. Maybe I'm easily pleased, maybe I was just waiting so damn long for something different that it peaked my interests. It's not a perfect film by any means and I'll admit after the first 2 acts, which sucked me right In, the 3rd act felt a lil rushed. No spoilers here don't worry.Look I started it because I was bored and to lazy to go to the media room and pick a disc so I netflix'd and chilled and it grabbed me from the start. It was fun at the least, maybe not for everyone due to the subject but I'd recommend it, if only for being outta the box. If ya seen it,let me know what you thought",Velvet Buzzsaw
536,rain-73227,"Great concept, not so great execution.",2,26 February 2019,"After watching the trailer for this movie it looked super interesting and engaging and I loved the concept of a horror movie based around art.
The actual movie was anything but engaging. The characters were pretentious and shallow and completely unlikable to the point that I think I only kept watching this movie to watch them get killed off. There was hardly any plot as pretty much every scene between the killings was superficial and petty conversations between the characters that went nowhere.
I'm giving it 5 stars simply because of Natalia Dyers' character, Coco, who was the only likable character in the entire movie.",Velvet Buzzsaw
537,Firefly_Embers,An outwardly intriguing story that doesn't quite live up to its potential,5,2 March 2019,"Velvet Buzzsaw opens as a mysterious and very well crafted story, with compelling and complex characters that are called to evolve as the movie progresses. The story-telling is superb and the pacing is on point. The actors offer great performances, especially when it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of Morf Vandewalt.As the movie progresses, though, what started as a rock solid plot with intriguing elements ends up losing its way and losing its identity, and what is left is an unsatisfying story that left me hungry for more and disappointed at the lack of answers regarding elements that end up feeling pointless.Enjoyable, although you may wish that some questions had been answered during the movie's runtime.",Velvet Buzzsaw
