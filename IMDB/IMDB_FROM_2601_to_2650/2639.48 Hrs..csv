0,MartinHafer,I can't see what folks saw in this one....,2,11 May 2013,"Nick Nolte is a tough and out of control cop who springs a con (Eddie Murphy) to help him locate two serial killers who have already killed at least five guys. These two are mismatched buddies in a buddy film.Back in 1982, ""48 Hours"" made a ton of money and was a surprise hit--and helped make Eddie Murphy a big star. However, when I see it today, I sure wonder what folks saw in it. It just comes off as a VERY nasty film--full of racial epithets, nudity, f-bombs (FYI--IMDB won't let me or anyone use this word in a review) and violence. And, to me, it seemed like most of this was put in the film just to offend--as if it somehow made the film edgy and hip. Well, to me it just seems nasty and unappealing. To make it worse, much of the film consists of really, really bad dialog, ridiculous police behaviors (with Nolte's character, the Bill of Rights simply don't exist), guns that NEVER need reloading and so much macho posturing that I felt like puking.",48 Hrs.
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Great fun, with a heck of a debut from Eddie Murphy",10,5 October 2010,"I was not expecting to enjoy 48 Hours as much as I did. It is hugely enjoyable, and has fun chemistry and no wasted scene. In fact it is for me one of the best buddy cop thrillers ever made. Eddie Murphy gives a heck of a debut in this film, all smoothness, charm and wisecracks, and this is one of his best films and roles along with Beverly Hills Cop and Trading Places. He is perfectly paired with Nick Nolte, who is also every bit as good as the rough, gruff straight man. The story is fun and doesn't fall into the trap of being predictable, and has many great scenes especially Murphy's taming of a redneck bar. The script is witty and funny, while the direction is solid and the film has some very beautifully orchestrated action sequences, shoot-ups and chases.In conclusion, 48 Hours is great fun and worth watching for the two leads, especially Murphy who gives one of his best performances by far here. 10/10 Bethany Cox",48 Hrs.
2,Leofwine_draca,Tough-as-nails buddy comedy,6,10 January 2013,"48 HRS. is another feather in the cap for director Walter Hill, a man who directed some of the toughest films of the 1980s. It's an early action comedy that pairs Nick Nolte as a no-nonsense cop and Eddie Murphy as a jive-talking crim who have to team up to track down a couple of unpleasant killers.The film is straightforward, predictable and downright entertaining. Nolte supplies the cop stuff, Murphy's on board for the comedy, and the bad guys (James Remar and Sonny Landham) are truly fearsome. There's not an overload of action, but the violent scenes that punctuate the dialogue are near-knuckle and hard-hitting, with Hill refusing to shy away from the depiction of on-screen violence.I can't say I'm really a fan of Nick Nolte - as an actor, he seems to take taciturn to the next level, and he's a grumpy bugger here. Murphy is much better, brimming with vitality in the days before he became smug and over-indulgent. Remar and Landham are excellent as the criminals; a couple of guys you definitely wouldn't want to get stuck in a lift with.48 HRS. is no masterpiece; in addition, there have been so, so many similar films made in the years since that its appeal has been diluted somewhat. Nevertheless, it provides entertainment that keeps on coming, all handled by a sure hand who I'm slowly discovering to be one of Hollywood's finest.",48 Hrs.
3,SnoopyStyle,Combustible Chemistry,8,4 January 2014,"Violent criminal Ganz escapes from prison, and is looking for a money stash. He leaves a trail of dead people. Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) survives the shootout. He grabs Ganz acquaintance Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from prison for 48 hours leave to help track down the killer.This is gritty rough movie from Walter Hill. The language is rough. It's not simply swearing. It is viciously vile. Nick Nolte calls Eddie Murphy a lot of racist language without batting an eye. The people are all good and proper low lifes. Even the gun shoots sound meaner. This movie runs on the combustible chemistry between Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy has a bit of fun once in awhile, and Nolte is at his growling best. This is also notable for Eddie Murphy's movie debut.",48 Hrs.
4,Prismark10,The boys are back in town,8,18 September 2016,"I regard 48 Hrs as an action adventure with a comedic debut performance by the then 21 years old, Eddie Murphy.Hard nosed, hard drinking cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) pulls a convicted bank robber Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from prison on a forged 48 hours pass to help him capture Hammond's old partner, Albert Ganz (James Remar) who killed Cates fellow cop.Ganz himself escaped from prison with the help of native, Billy Bear and both go on a killing rampage as they look for the half a million dollars that went missing after one of their robberies.Reggie knows where the money is but wants to stay one step ahead of Cates. Both distrust each other but need to work together to catch Ganz.Walter Hill made a tough thriller with plenty of violence and cursing but imbued it with the humour of Murphy fresh from Saturday Night Live. Without his presence this would just be a forgotten police action film from the 1980s. He owns that scene when he pretends to be a cop at a country & western dive bar as he shakes down the patron.Murphy elevates the film with the help of some off beat support by Remar and David Patrick Kelly. Nolte plays off well with the street smart, lean and hungry Murphy as the gruff cop who drinks too much and is too flabby.In the sequel, Another 48 Hours, eight years later it was Murphy who would be flabby and out of shape going against a leaner, meaner Nolte.",48 Hrs.
5,kosmasp,Crazy funny,8,3 February 2021,"Crazy being Nick Nolte and funny being Eddie Murphy ... although I reckon one could argue the other way around too. A formula or buddy element that was used in many other movies too (Men in Black to name just one). The casting of the movie was quite good to say the least. One of the female costars of Miami Vice being one of the actors involved in this, but also many other actors you've probably seen since.Although I reckon that is a tough one and only true if you watch at least as many movies and shows as I do. Still a lot of good actors in this, a lot of shooting going on as well. The jokes mostly find their aim too. So overall quite the template for the buddy cop ""genre"" you will have the pleasure watching. Almost a shame this only had one sequel ... then again maybe it's a good thing too",48 Hrs.
6,gavin6942,A Young Denise Crosby? Wow! What More Can I Want?,5,7 August 2006,"Before picking up ""48 Hours"" I knew nothing about this film: didn't know the plot or the actors or anything else. Finding out it was Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy was bittersweet: never been a fan of Murphy (and recent additions like Pluto Nash and Shrek have done nothing to improve my opinion). Nolte I expect some two-bit, hackneyed action hero (which is luckily exactly what I received). The film has these two in a series of unlikely events that make little sense and seem only to be set up as a means to show two guys drinking and shooting people (while trying not to get shot). Some actions films thrive on this (Lethal Weapon, Die Hard) but those films actually have a soul.A series of hanging plot threads leave a spectre hanging over this film (like communism over Europe in the 1800s). Maybe the sequel will resolve these concerns for me, but more than likely this film will leave me perpetually unfulfilled.I should say that I was entertained. While not one of the better films I've seen, any time you have a buddy cop movie with lots of drinking and shooting something fun is bound to happen (though, certainly, this film is not as good or as fun as ""Tango and Cash""). And having now seen this film, I appreciate ""Last Action Hero"" ever so much more. (Now ,that's a film that's under-rated.) Murphy fan? Rent it. Not a Murphy fan, don't. That's all you need to know.",48 Hrs.
7,jboothmillard,48 Hours,7,21 January 2008,"I had heard of this film a couple of times in the past, and when the opportunity came to watch it, I knew I couldn't miss iti, drected by Walter Hill (Brewster's Millions, Red Heat, Last Man Standing, Bullet to the Head). Basically convicted robber Albert Ganz (James Remar) has escaped from a road gang with his partner Billy Bear (Sonny Landham), and immediately kill their partner, then check into the Walden Hotel in San Francisco under false names. Alcoholic and racist cop Detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) and his fellow cops Vanzant (James Keane) and Algren (Jonathan Banks) are obviously looking for him, and check out on a guy at the hotel named G.P. Polson, who turns out to be Ganz. They manage to get away though, and kill Jack's partners, now Jack wants revenge, so he convinces his boss, Captain Haden (Licence to Kill's Frank McRae), to let him work alone on this case. Jack goes to a prison where Ganz and Billy's former partner Reggie Hammond (a fantastic debut from Golden Globe nominated Eddie Murphy), and he springs him out for 48 hours so he can help him find the villains. It is not going to be easy, not just because of Ganz and Billy, but Jack and Reggie are not getting along with each other, the tension at one point starting beating each other up. Reggie remembers $500,000 stashed away in the trunk of his car, which has been parked ever since he was convicted (something like three years). Ganz and Billy are obviously after the money, and they have kidnapped Rosalie (Kerry Sherman), girlfriend of former partner Luther (David Patrick Kelly) so he can get the cash filled car. Jack and Reggie are now near to catching Ganz and Billy, but they need to hurry before Reggie has to go back to prison. Also starring Annette O'Toole as Elaine and Brion James as Ben Kehoe. Nolte is pretty rough with a his gravelly voice, Murphy is brilliant with his small impressions, swearing and even some serious moments, there are some good chases and fights in between, and it made me laugh as well, a pretty good comedy thriller. Very good!",48 Hrs.
8,Woodyanders,Lives up to its classic reputation and then some,9,22 February 2007,"Scruffy maverick police detective Jack Cates (a marvelously gritty portrayal by Nick Nolte) springs smartaleck convict Reggie Hammond (a bravura star-making performance by Eddie Murphy) from jail so he can catch dangerous criminal Ganz (a frightfully intense James Remar) and his equally lethal partner Billy Bear (the always imposing Sonny Landham) within a single frantic 48 hour time period. Walter Hill's masterfully lean, mean, tautly streamlined and economical direction keeps the pace roaring along at a nonstop breakneck clip and stages the frequent stirring shoot-outs with electrifying brio. The raw, nervy, rat-a-tat-tat volatile and explosive chemistry between the gruff Nolte and the smooth Murphy delivers plenty of incendiary fireworks which are often peppered with harsh full-bore profanity and culminate in one hell of a knock-down, drag-out back alley fist fight. The now legendary sequence with Murphy terrorizing the hick patrons of a rowdy redneck honkytonk bar with his fiercely cocky and aggressive in-your-face attitude rates as another undeniable highlight. The excellent supporting cast includes Annette O'Toole as Nolte's fed-up bar maid girlfriend, David Patrick Kelly as a sniveling weasel, Denise Crosby and Greta Blackburn as hookers, Jonathan Banks as a doomed cop, Frank McRae as Nolte's huffy disapproving superior, Brion James as a fellow flatfoot, Peter Jason as a racist bartender, and Luis Contreras as a gang member. Both Ric Waite's sharp, slick, glittery cinematography and James Horner's robust, rousing score hit the spot. The great, thrilling song ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" by the Busboys likewise scores a bull's eye. Essential viewing.",48 Hrs.
9,ccthemovieman-1,Questions: Rhetorical & Otherwise,3,15 March 2007,"Well, let's see: 1 - This is a Walter Hill film; 2 - Nick Nolte is one of the stars; 3 - the others are Eddie Murphy, Annette O'Toole and James Remar. Uhh, ya think you might hear the Lord's name in vain a few times in here? Answer: yeah.Second question: with the above director and cast, do you think the film might be a little crude or a little harsh in spots? (Same answer)Two more rhetorical questions: Do you think either the critics or the public in this case cared about the above? Do you think they just looked at it as a ""great buddy film"" and another chance for a rising young black comedian to break out in stardom (which he did)? Yup, for indiscriminate viewers who like their action slanted and profane, this is a winner all the way! Well, at least it introduced us to Murhy who a string of hits in the '80s. Hill went on to make many other ultra-violent, ultra-profane films. Can't say much for the other careers.",48 Hrs.
10,moonspinner55,Satisfying the masses...,4,3 June 2007,"Walter Hill's hard, profane action-comedy, littered with as many dead bodies as it is wisecracks, redefined the 'buddy movie' for audiences of the 1980s, rocketing ""Saturday Night Live"" TV-comedian Eddie Murphy to stardom. Murphy plays a self-righteous, self-amused convict sprung from jail by beat-out cop Nick Nolte to help him catch two escaped psychopaths, who are busy mowing down various residents of San Francisco. Cocky set-pieces, such as Murphy's big scene impersonating a bitter, enraged cop in a redneck bar, sent viewers out on a high, but the recklessness of the verbal put-downs which form the basis of the screenplay aren't so very funny. Nolte and Murphy are quite a pair, and both get hammered pretty hard for the sake of some macho laughs, but the fast-pacing can only compensate for so much mindless violence, all of which is undermined by despicable behavior. Hill doesn't seem to understand the irony of turning irresponsible people into heroes--he just wants to satisfy the audience. For some, being pummeled and insulted may equal a good time. Followed by a belated sequel in 1990. ** from ****",48 Hrs.
11,blanche-2,A huge hit that inspired a lot of imitators,7,2 July 2009,"Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy have ""48 Hours"" to catch two bad guys in this 1982 film, directed and co-written by Walter Hill. Nolte is a renegade cop, Jack Cates, with a quick temper and a big mouth. He manages the release of a criminal, Reggie Hammond (Murphy) for 48 hours so that Hammond can help him arrest two loose canon escapees from a work gang, Albert Ganz and Billy Bear (James Remar and Sonny Landham). The two have left a trail of dead bodies on a quest for robbery money. Reggie promises that he knows his former associates well enough to track them down.""48 Hours"" provides plenty of action in the form of gunfire and car chases as these two get to know one another and appreciate what the other brings to the table. There's plenty of comedy, too, including Nolte's introduction to Murphy in his prison cell.There have been many of these buddy movies since ""48 Hours,"" which was a huge hit. While I admit to liking the ""Lethal Weapon"" series better, Nolte and Murphy are great together, both delivering strong, edgy performances.Though it's a formula film, the two actors and the good direction lift ""48 Hours"" out of the formula to provide great characterizations and a high level of entertainment.",48 Hrs.
12,michaelRokeefe,An unlikely duo that packs a punch for the bad guy; and each other.,7,27 February 2002,"Laugh out loud funny. A rough around the edges cop(Nick Nolte)arranges a temporary parole for a cocky convict(Eddie Murphy)in order to help in tracking down a couple of killers. Whiskey throated Nolte is perfect as the laid back, hard hitting cop. Murphy's big screen debut is a delight. The Nolte/Murphy team is like a match along side a twenty gallon drum of gasoline. Crude and absolutely believable. No big special effects needed to keep you satisfied. Rib cracking funny. Also featured are:Annette O'Toole, Frank McRae and James Remar.",48 Hrs.

14,hitchcockthelegend,"You switch from an armed robber to a pimp, you're all set.",8,22 April 2019,"A hard as nails cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him, in order to track down an escaped convict cop killer.The mismatched buddy buddy formula exploded onto the screen here in a ball of violence, profanity and pin sharp one liners. It also launched Eddie Murphy into 1980s stardom. Directed by Walter Hill and starring Nick Nolte alongside Murphy as part of an electrifying black and white double act, it's unrelenting in pace and bad attitude. It could have been so different though, with the likes of Stallone, Reynolds, Pryor and Hines attached at various times for lead parts, it now is written in folklore that Murphy got the break and grasped it with both hands (he was actually fired at one point mind!). Thankfully the problems behind the scenes were resolved to give us a classic of its type.A big success for Paramount it paved the way for more choice same formula pictures in the decade, but few were able to be so coarse and daring with the racial divide explosions. Murphy is outstanding, quick as an A.K. 47 in vocal delivery and with visual comedic ticks in full effect, he plays off of the also excellent gruff rough and tough Nolte superbly. Unsurprisingly the plot trajectory is simple enough, but such is the writing and performances (James Remar, Sonny Landham and David Patrick Kelly in support) it's one hell of a live wire ride from start to finish.In amongst the verbal and action carnage you find plenty of 80s pop culture, with a blunderbuss sound track and a score from James Horner that pings around the Los Angeles locales (he would rework it for Arnie starrer Commando in 1985). This points to a time where now it is perceived as being tactless and a relic, and yet it instils realism as it captures the zeitgeist of the era. So not one for the easily offended then, but for nostalgics and those interested in the expansion of the action comedy formula, then this is a must see that still delivers high octane entertainment. 8/10",48 Hrs.
15,Theo Robertson,A Buddy Movie,4,30 June 2004,"Buddy movies were very popular in the 1980s , less popular in the 1990s and non existent at the turn of the century . I think the reason they`re non existent these days is that it`s a genre that is very , very limited as anyone who has seen more than a very small handful of buddy movies can testify . It all comes down having a hard boiled cop matched up with a contrasting character and there you have it 48 HOURS is better than most simply down to the fact that it was a fairly original idea at the time and where the movie works best is with the violent thriller element . Some of the violence is quite shocking down to the fact that it`s so cold blooded . Take the "" Nice gun "" scene which is an uneasy scene to watch down to the cold calculating way the violence is dispensed . A murder scene doesn`t have to gory for it to be disturbing , something that I hope directors will take note of Where the film is less successful is when it`s trying to be amusing . I do confess I`ve always disliked Eddie Murphy down to the fact that he always seems to play the same wise cracking urbane black dude in every movie he`s appeared in and here he`s every bit as irritating as every movie he`s been in . Oh and did I spot a blunder where Murphy and Nolte`s characters are introduced at the prison cell block ? Nolte`s cop asks Murphy`s con to help him find a fugitive - Right in front of a crowded prison wing and Murphy agrees ! I was under the impression that if anyone did that in real life they`d get capped by the inmates before they left the gates . Failing that they`d be watching their back for the rest of their life on the outside , no one likes a prison stoolie How much you enjoy 48 HOURS comes down to how much you enjoy buddy movies . I enjoyed it in parts but as some people have already pointed out you can get too much of a good thing",48 Hrs.
16,Hey_Sweden,"One of the best ""buddy"" movies ever made.",10,25 April 2013,"Many have been made over the years, but few can match the hilarity that this movie provides. It's a sharp, witty, and incredibly energetic action comedy, and remains one of the highlights of the under-rated director Walter Hills' career. It introduced a then very young comedy star named Eddie Murphy to the big screen in a big way. Over three decades later, it remains fun to watch.A rock solid Nick Nolte stars as weary, cranky detective Jack Cates, who's after a psychotic prison escapee named Albert Ganz (an intense James Remar). In order to get the goods on Ganz, Cates decides he will enlist the services of Reggie Hammond (Murphy), a slick, smooth young criminal who was once in the same gang as Ganz. Cates springs Hammond out of jail for the title period of time, and the sparks fly as the two strong personalities butt heads (almost literally) with each other.Murphy exudes tons of confidence, and lights up the screen in what is rightly regarded as the films' best scene, when he intimidates the regulars at a redneck bar. He and Nolte get some amazing chemistry as their banter flies back and forth. The relationship between them is believable at every turn. In fact, it's so antagonistic that, not surprisingly, Cates and Hammond come to blows. Director Hill keeps the movie racing forward; there's no filler here, just a good and meaty story with some effective scenes of violence and some nicely done chases. It's all set to a catchy James Horner score.Annette O'Toole is unfortunately rather wasted in an under developed role as Cates's fed-up girlfriend, Frank McRae is amusing as the kind of Yelling Boss we're all familiar with from countless action films, and Remar and Sonny Landham are very enjoyable villains. (Remars' Ganz is such a nut job that a hooker surmises that he enjoys shooting cops more than getting laid.) The supporting cast features many appearances by familiar faces and great character actors: David Patrick Kelly, Brion James, Jonathan Banks, James Keane, Denise Crosby, Olivia Brown, Jim Haynie, Jack Thibeau, Peter Jason, Chris Mulkey, R.D. Call, Gloria Gifford, John Dennis Johnston, and Ola Ray.The 97 minute run time of this classic pretty much flies by. With a thoroughly memorable pair of characters at the forefront, it keeps the audience watching. Along with, say, Riggs and Murtaugh from the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise, Cates and Hammond pretty much *define* the buddy movie. Viewers hoping for a tough, hard hitting action film with entertaining roles and a good sense of humour won't be disappointed with what they see here.10 out of 10.",48 Hrs.
17,poolandrews,"""Look at you, you've got a $500 suit on & your still a lowlife."" Good but not great.",6,31 July 2007,"48 Hrs. starts as vicious killer Billy Bear (Sonny Landham) helps his vicious killer mate Albert Ganz (James Remar) escape prison while on work detail fixing up a railroad, they head for San Francisco where they kidnap Rosalie (Kerry Sherman) the girlfriend of Luther (David Patrick Kelly) & say to him that if he ever wants to see her again to get the stolen $500,000 that has been stashed away by Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy). While following up a lead on a stolen credit card two cops are shot dead by Ganz & a third Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) has his gun stolen which Ganz continues to use for his own violent purposes, this is now personal for Jack & forges some papers to get Hammond out of jail to help him track his old gang member Ganz down...Co-written & directed by Walter Hill this was the first buddy buddy cop flick & re-watching it today it's alright but hasn't quite stood the test of time. The script by Hill, Steven E. de Souza, Roger Spottiswoode & Larry Gross lays down the basic rules all of it's many imitators would bide by, two mismatched guy's are thrown together by some crime they are both involved with & after lots of abuse they develop a mutual respect for each by the end, oh & one or both have to save the other's life at some point. It's a formula that's been done to death over the years & just because 48 Hrs. was the first doesn't automatically make it any good, to be fair to it it is good but not great. For a start there's not much action in it, a few dull shoot-outs, a short car chase & a couple of fistfights is about the sum total of it. Also one has to say the language is somewhat ripe with all sorts of profanity spoken, I just find constant streams of foul language to be a lazy way to write & it also gets old very quickly. It's a touch slow going in places & the story itself about stolen money isn't anything to excited about either, like I said good but not great.Director Hill does OK but there is one plot hole I can't figure out, so Ganz & Billy Bear kidnap Luther's girlfriend & tell him to get the money right? Well why didn't they kidnap Luther himself, keep him at gunpoint & just go with him to collect the money on Monday morning & then split? I mean shoot-outs in trains stations & stealing buses is not the way to keep a low profile especially since every cop in the city is looking for you. That just sounds a much better plan to me. Anyway there are some amusing foul mouthed one-liners here & the scene where Murphy intimidates a bar full of racist rednecks is hilarious but overall it's a bit light on action as far as I'm concerned.Technically the film is good with decent production values, set in San Francisco it was actually shot in Los Angeles. This was Eddie Murphy's first film, although it nearly wasn't as Gregory Hines was the first choice to play Reggie while Richard Pryor & Denzel Washington were also considered. Mickey Rourke was offered the role of Jack Cates but turned it down although Nolte does a good job regardless.48 Hrs. is a decent buddy buddy cop thriller that's a little short on action for my liking, it's still watchable with some funny profanity but it's not something I'd want to watch again anytime soon. I would say 48 Hrs. is so well remembered simply because it was the first rather than being the best. Followed by a sequel Another 48 Hrs. (1990) & literally 100's of imitators.",48 Hrs.

19,zardoz-13,Slam-Bang Shoot;em Up Saga Set in San Francisco,7,8 March 2011,"This gritty city buddy picture about an incorruptible, hard-as-nails, San Francisco plainclothes detective and a convict on a weekend pass who team up to track down a couple of ruthless, cold-blooded killers with a half-million dollars at stake qualifies as an above-average opus. Nick Nolte was well on his way to super-stardom when he shared the screen with ""Saturday Night Live"" sensation Eddie Murphy in his feature film debut. ""Hard Times"" writer & director Walter Hill and scenarist Roger Spottiswoode deserve credit for conjuring up--with co-scribes Larry Gross of ""Streets of Fire"" and Steven E. de Souza of ""Die Hard""--a tough-guy action thriller that was short of originality but long on the charisma that its two stars generated. Reportedly, producer Lawrence Gordon had an idea that barely resembled the outcome. In the Gordon premise, a criminal abducts the Louisiana governor's daughter, attaches an explosive device to her head, and demands ransom in 48 hours. The brutal cop assigned to the case recruits the kidnapper's prison cell mate to assist him on the investigation. Actually, they could have made the Gordon plot as a straight-to-video spin-off. After a hardened criminal, Albert Ganz (James Remar of ""The Warriors""), escapes from a California chain-gang, Ganz with his crazy-as-a-loon Indian partner Billy Bear (Sonny Landham of ""Predator""), they head for San Francisco to get the cash that their cohorts, Luther (Daniel Patrick Kelly of ""The Warriors"") and Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) have secretly stashed in a convertible WV sports car in a garage. Rough-hewn Jack Cates (Nick Nolte of ""North Dallas Forty"") decides to take a chance on a loud-mouthed convict who knows Ganz. Reggie has served almost three years on his sentence in San Quentin with six months left when Cates comes a-calling. Reggie convinces Cates to spring him and Cates forges a signature to get Reggie out of stir. The two have a hard time getting along initially but by the dust has settled, they are literally as thick-as-thieves. The shoot-outs are as thuggish as the characters squeezing the trigger as our heroes hunt down the hair-trigger villains. Neither Ganz nor Billy Bear show any qualms about blasting cops and taking hostages. Literally, there is never a dull moment. ""48 HRS"" may not have been the first cops and robbers shoot'em up in the 80s to feature a foul-mouthed, screaming police superior--Frank McRae fits the bill to a tee--but it was probably near the top. Some say ""48 HRS"" spawned the police buddy picture genre, but they are presumptious. The earliest buddy picture about cops was ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967) with Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. ""48 HRS"" might have inspired the pairings of other stars in an urban actioneer, and the Jack Cates character served as a prototype for Mel Gibson's suicidal ""Lethal Weapon"" hero Martin Riggs. You cannot help but wonder if Spottiswoode and Hill weren't inspired by Akira Kurosawa's 1949 crime thriller ""Stray Dog"" because Cates loses his .44 Smith & Wesson revolver early on during the action. Cates is trying to help Detective Algren (Jonathan Banks of ""Beverly Hills Cop"") and Detective Vanzant (James Keane of ""Apocalypse Now"") make an arrest at the Walden Hotel. Ganz surprises the cops when he slips out of his room by another door and comes up behind them in the hallway. A gunfight erupts. Vanzant takes a couple of slugs in the chest, and Ganz threatens to finish off Algren. Ganz grabs Cates' handgun just as Toshirô Mifune lost his pistol in ""Stray Dog."" Nolte and Murphy make a perfectly matched but mismatched heroic pair who spend most of their time in each other's faces. They develop a grudging respect for each other after a savage slugfest on the sidewalk. Miraculously, Reggie's Giorgio Armani suit isn't torn to shreds during their knock-down, drag-out brawl. These guys run into more trouble from the law as they close in on Ganz and Billy. At least twice they find themselves interfered with by men in blue. Eventually, they corner the villains in Chinatown and blast it out with them. The ending with Ganz holding Reggie at gunpoint as a human shield against the sullen Cates is straight out of ""Dirty Harry."" The relentless action, the wisecracking--mostly improvised--dialogue, and memorable performances by Nolte and Murphy boost this routine thriller. Murphy's scene in a redneck bar as he masquerades as a cop makes this police movie worth watching. Indeed, Murphy garnered an Golden Globe nomination for his debut performance. Hill anted up a sequel ""Another 48 HRS"" about eight years later with Nolte and Murphy reprising their roles.",48 Hrs.
20,view_and_review,Whoa! Holy Racial Slurs Batman,7,23 September 2015,"Besides being a nostalgic walk through the San Francisco of my childhood, 48 Hours apprised me of something else--it was incredibly racist. I'm not talking about the subtle innuendo type racism; but the brash, in-your-face, N-word using, unabashed racism. Now, I know that it was done all in the name of comedy but I was shocked. I saw this movie so many years ago, and really, I'm sure I never saw the whole film because no way my parents would have allowed it. I think the little bit I did see was by popping in the VHS when they weren't home and I know now that I understood very little of it.This movie absolutely wouldn't fly today. The closest thing I've seen to it is Rush Hour, and even as much as Chris Tucker pushed the envelope with the subtle digs at Jackie Chan's Chinese heritage, you definitely saw that a line was drawn. In 48 Hours, no line was set--which is maybe why it was such a hit.Eddie Murphy was funny, though not nearly as funny as in other movies. Nick Nolte was all too good as the raspy voiced, surly cop. And Oh how can I forget the loud Black police captain played by Frank McRae. Did 48 Hours start that trend? 48 Hours is a classic but not nearly what I remember now looking through the lenses of an adult.",48 Hrs.
21,AaronCapenBanner,Big Hit In Its Day.,5,24 September 2013,"Nick Nolte plays cop Jack Cates, who is the sole survivor of a massacre of policeman, committed by a crazed killer who is desperately trying to find a hidden stash of money. Eddie Murphy plays Reggie Hammond, a wise-cracking convict who is familiar with the killer, so is released to Jack's custody for 48 Hrs. to help track him down, which will look good for him when his parole hearing comes up. Of course, they hate each other, yet make a surprisingly good team...Not many surprises here, since it all unfolds exactly as you'd expect, though that wouldn't matter so much if you cared about the characters, which is difficult to do. Though this was a huge hit in its day, the famous ""new sheriff in town scene"" is utterly unbelievable, and film substitutes crude humor and language for interesting characters and believable dialogue and story.",48 Hrs.

He's just not funny, and the humour consists of either derogatory jokes about women, or just downright racist abhorrence.It may have been just acceptable back in 1982, but now its tiresome stuff, and it just feels like a cheap shot for even cheaper laughs.Nolte is perfectly fine as the by the numbers cop, and as I've said before, Murphy looks uncomfortable, and doesn't have the swagger he has in his more successful films.

23,Wuchakk,"Coarse, comic booky cop thriller with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy",6,21 May 2015,"""48 HRS."" (1982) is a crime thriller starring Nick Nolte as a tough guy/alcoholic cop in San Francisco who survives a fracas where two officers are killed. To apprehend the culprits (James Remar & Sonny Landham) he enlists the services of a convict (Eddie Murphy) for 48 hours. Annette O'Toole plays the cop's barely-seen babe and is therefore neglected.The film was directed by Walter Hill, the director and co-writer of 1979's ""The Warriors,"" and so it has some of the flair of that movie, as well as two of its main actors (Remar and David Patrick Kelly). It's easy to confuse it with ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" which came out two years later, since they're both cop thrillers starring Eddie Murphy, but ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is the superior film IMHO. Of course, it depends on what you're in the mood for. ""48 HRS"" is more serious, brutal and edgy while ""BHC"" is lighter and more likable. The latter could be described as part comedy (although mostly serious) whereas the former is rough and nigh profane with amusing touches. ""BHC"" is just more palatable and has better themes in my opinion. The streetwise edginess of ""48 HRS"" is too over-the-top comic booky and it's a turn-off. Nonetheless, it's a quality cop thriller and the character ark of the main characters is good, albeit predictable.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.GRADE: B-",48 Hrs.
24,Mr-Fusion,"Still holds up, thanks to the chemistry between the two actors, and the intro of Eddie Murphy",7,25 August 2012,"Turns out Walter Hill pioneered the ""buddy movie"" craze when he paired Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy back in 1982. Nolte is well cast as the worn-out cop who's forced to give Eddie Murphy's slick convict a weekend pass in order to track down two cop-killers (James Remar and Sonny Landham). But cop and con couldn't get along worse, making the allotted 48 hours a grueling test for both of them. On its own, this is a pretty god cop movie. But it's the great chemistry between Nolte and Murphy that fuels ""48 Hrs."" The animosity between the two feels completely genuine, even though it's played for comedic effect. This is a gleefully non-politically correct movie, and the bristling undercurrent of ill-will charges the dialog between the two (even a few racial slurs, here and there). The tension ends up exploding in a fairly brutal fistfight between the two. Both men sell it, right down the line. But it's Murphy (making his auspicious film debut) that makes this film memorable. From the first time we see him (singing ""Roxanne"" off-key in his cell) to the infamous scene in which Murphy takes on a redneck bar (""There's a new sheriff in town""), he easily walks away with this thing. 7/10",48 Hrs.

26,JamesHitchcock,All the moral complexity of a playground game of cops and robbers,4,6 August 2007,"The ""buddy"" movie, despite its name, does not always show us characters who are the best of friends. A much more common format is to have two individuals who are radically different in character, and whose relationship is based upon mutual suspicion, even mutual dislike, which gradually changes, if not to friendship, at least to mutual respect.""48 Hours"" is a film of this kind. Albert Ganz, a violent criminal, is sprung from jail by an associate. Jack Cates is the police officer charged with tracking him down, and in order to do so he needs the assistance of another of Ganz's associates, Reggie Hammond. Unfortunately, Hammond is himself currently serving a jail term for theft, but Cates manages to get him released on parole for forty-eight hours. (Hence the title).This is sometimes regarded as the film which created the ""buddy"" genre and led to several similar films in the eighties and nineties, especially the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. It is not, however, as original as some of its defenders claim. The ""buddy"" movie was only a variation on the ""tough cop"" genre made popular in the late sixties and seventies by the likes of ""Bullitt"" and ""Dirty Harry"" (both of which, like ""48 Hours"", are set in San Francisco). The idea of teaming together police officers with different characters was not exactly new, either in the cinema or on television. Take for instance ""Cagney and Lacey"", and even Dirty Harry was sometimes paired with partners who were more liberal and less gung-ho than himself. Neither was the idea of a policeman relying on one crook to catch another a new one.Even if ""48 Hours"" is regarded as the first of the ""buddy"" cop movies, it is not a particularly good one. Its most original feature, and in my view the best thing about it, is Eddie Murphy's street-smart, wisecracking Hammond- I liked the scene set in the redneck bar, although I did find myself wondering exactly how typical such establishments are of liberal San Francisco. Nick Nolte's Cates, however, although cast in the same hard-line, ruthless mould as Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan or Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt, lacked their charisma, and the film lacked the depth of the better ""tough cop"" films, especially ""Dirty Harry"" itself, which raised some surprisingly complex issues about the nature of justice and the philosophy of law enforcement.Walter Hill prefers to ignore issues of this type and the moral lines in ""48 Hours"" are clear-cut. Ganz and his associates are clearly defined as the bad guys, and Cates and Hammond as the good guys, which gives them a licence to shoot first and ask questions later. It also appears to give them a licence to swear like troopers; even today the film would be remarkable for its excessive use of bad language, and the interminable stream of cuss-words must have seemed even more shocking in the early eighties. The film-makers' intention was obviously to make a fast-moving, hard-hitting action thriller, but ""48 Hours"" is a rather weak example of the genre, an ultra-violent cop movie with all the moral complexity of a playground game of cops and robbers. Its message seems to be nothing more than ""Bang! Bang! You're Dead!"" 4/10",48 Hrs.

30,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Before there was Lethal Weapon there was...,7,3 March 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A felon (James Remar) is busted out of jail and it falls on the head of a cranky cop (Nick Nolte) to catch him. Following a tense stand-off, his partner is shot by the convict and in order to find him he must team up with another convict (Eddie Murphy) to catch him. But right from the off, this is one partnership that ain't gonna flow like a boat.At just 21, Murphy took his stand-up comedy act and took to the big screen with veteran Nolte for this raucious cop thriller. The movie also introduced the likes of notable character actor Remar as well as David Patrick 'Sully' Kelly in a supporting role.It has (for it's time, anyway) an interesting angle of a good guy and a bad guy coming together and what would happen if they came to depend on each other. Murphy's character indeed isn't awfully likable and an unfortunate stereotype for some black characters in cinema, but Nolte gives a good turn as the hard-assed, cranky cop. The movie has it's 'buddy-buddy' angle down to a tee, but it seems to be too indulgent of this and seems to forget that it was actually meant to be an action movie and concentrate on the action (of which there's hardly any!) making it become rather boring after a while.If you're looking for a good 'buddy-buddy' cop movie, you've come to the right place.

31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Every 80s movie ever... except it's not that good.,5,29 January 2019,"If you broadly described the plot of '48 Hrs. (1982)' to someone and asked them to guess what it is you're talking about, I'm pretty confident that they'd come up with almost any 80s movie before they came up with this. That's because this film is, essentially, every 80s movie ever (or, at least, every 80s action/ cop movie ever). Two unlikely allies have to work through their personal troubles - and do it fast - in order to bring down the bad guy, eventually learning that maybe they're not so different after all before enjoying one last bit of now truly 'friendly' banter as they drive off into the sunset together. There is one thing that sets this apart from most of its decade's more memorable entries, however: it's just not that good. Generally, it's a generic experience devoid of any real charm, one that often feels as though it's actively going out of its way to make you dislike it. It feels quite 'nasty' - or, perhaps, pessimistic - pretty much for the sake of it, while still trying to end on a high, a ""we're friends now so let's forget about all that racism"". It truly is bizarre, not least of all because there aren't really any characters and so we just don't care about the core relationship. I mean, Nolte's just an unlikable walking bag of sand who growls at everyone he sees and who's constantly really unpleasant to his newfound partner for no real reason. He uses racial slurs like playground insults and doesn't ever learn his lesson - in fact, the flick never even makes a point of it. His only development comes off-screen when, around the start of the third-act, he decides he likes Murphy, for some reason; subsequently, he doesn't treat him like something he scraped off his shoe. Meanwhile, Murphy is... Murphy. He's as charismatic, and occasionally problematic (when he gets a chance to turn the tables on some racist rednecks, he immediately resorts to homophobia), as ever. Still, he's clearly the best part of this picture. Even the action, which is hard-boiled and 'violent', doesn't really live up to the standards of the era, despite being competent enough. It's this that makes for the movie's most memorable stuff, though. Overall, the film doesn't really amount to much. It's not really entertaining and it's also incredibly forgettable. As I mentioned, its only merits are Murphy's charisma and the occasional bit of blank-firing, squib-triggering gun-play or (perhaps more ironically enjoyable than straightforwardly so) stunt-doubled, turn-taking fisticuffs. Still, that's not enough for a recommendation. 4/10",48 Hrs.

35,The-Sarkologist,"Eddie Murphy's first film, and the film that made him a star",4,22 July 2011,"This is an Eddie Murphy movie which means that it is going to immediately have a cult following. I don't mind Murphy that much because his fast-talking style amuses me, but in general I am not much of a fan. Having read a couple of write ups it is interesting to learn that this was his first movie and the scene that made this movie was the one in which he walks into a Redneck bar, pretends to be a cop, and has everybody under his control. This is classic Murphy fast talk, but when you have seen movies like Beverly Hills' Cop, then this scene doesn't mean much. When put into the context of his first movie then it shows us a star in the making. The movie stars Eddy Murphy and Nick Nolte but Eddie Murphy dominates the movie with his cool black man jive and his easy going attitude. Nolte slips out of favour quite often with his bad attitude. Nolte plays a lone cop who just seems to hate people. He refuses to work with people and when a dangerous criminal escapes from gaol, he takes it on alone. In reality there would be a city wide manhunt and every cop would be out looking for him, but hey, why let reality get in the way of a good cop movie. The director of this movie, Walter Hill, creates an interesting atmosphere. The film is set in San Fransisco which means that it is perpetually cold and wet. Most of the action of the movie takes place at night, the only real action scenes that happens during the day is a gun fight in a San Fransisco subway station and the initial escape. The dank and dirty nature of all of the locations also gives a feeling of the street. The fugitive is little more than a street criminal who is in gaol for armed robbery. When he escapes he has not real place to go and spends his time in cheap hotels. Reggie Hammond is of this crowd but he tries to lift himself out of it by putting on an expensive suit. He tries to look impressive but really just fits in with the dirty atmosphere. I wouldn't rate this movie as one of the greats. Eddie Murphy is cool but the movie is slow and the action scenes are not gripping. The fight scene between Murphy and Nolte drags on and in the end one tends to be glad that it is finished. Die hard Murphy fans might disagree but truth is that this is my opinion.",48 Hrs.

It helps that both Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (not to mention Annette O'Toole) are consummate pros. James Remar and David Kelly are no slouches themselves, and their performances are strong enough to balance the scales vis a vis The Good Guys versus The Bad Guys; it seems like a toss-up at any given point just WHO will come out on top (although, precisely because it IS a formulaic buddy movie, we already KNOW, deep down, who's going to win; the only real question is: will the Con make it?). Under-utilized Sonny Landham also plays one of the villains. I, for one, would've liked to have seen this guy go on to a career like that of Danny Trejo. Like Trejo, Landham was always an interesting actor to watch.",48 Hrs.
38,johnnyboyz,Worth watching for an early piece of work from Murphy and its buddy familiarity but there is nothing spectacular here.,6,14 January 2008,"Whilst not visually spectacular nor particularly original, I found 48 Hrs. to be a rather enjoyable and engrossing film that uses the obvious 'buddy' formula but also makes the ride a little more pleasurable thanks to its pace and its series of scenes that, although have been done to death, are executed in an entertaining and engaging manner. The only real upshot of a repeated viewing of this film, decades later, is to see Eddie Murphy in his first film as a criminal who is let out before becoming a cop for the narratives duration.I can see how Murphy went on to bigger and better things by watching this film. Whilst not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination, Murphy plays his character named Reggie Hammond to such a degree that by the end when it seems like he has to go back to prison, we have empathised with him and associated ourselves close enough to even like him; maybe more than the lead character Jack Cates (Nolte). But this is where the films apparent familiarity comes into play; Reggie may have been a criminal and may have served two thirds of his sentence but he is a human being and his time out on unconventional parole is sugar coated with the re-occurring joke that he wants to have sex; this combining with the looming fact that towards the end, despite whatever he does to aid the capture/demise of the baddie; he will have to serve his whole sentence.But there can be few complaints about 48 Hrs. For its day, I could probably estimate that the film was better than it looks and feels now what with the buddy genre so popular back then. Murphy has made his career on buddy films: this, the Beverly Hills Cop film, Metro and hell; even the Shrek films are buddy flicks. But here, that old combination of white guy/black guy is not only utilised to compliment the material but also as an excuse to include some really quite racial issues. After an obligatory opening when its established Cates is a cop with absolutely everything to loose, he turns to Hammond who 'knows the street' despite being away from it for two and a half years. From here, the white cop, black accomplice combination is played out to an effect seen in later films such as the third Die Hard picture. But the material on offer here is very racial: Hammond is referred to behind his back as a 'soul brother' and is called 'charcoal' by Cates. Not only this but native Americans seem to get a bit of stick also. However, the one scene which balances it all up is the scene in the redneck bar in which Murphy rules the show. Yes, I 'got' the The French Connection reference when he parades them in the bar; publicly humiliating them as they stand there and he poses as a police man in what could be one of the most famous scenes from an 80s film.But apart from delve into some racial archetypes, the film keeps on a long and straight road; never veering off to be something it knows it cannot. The antagonists consist of their own interracial buddy two-some with Albert Ganz (Remar) and Ben Kehoe (James) forming their group and they get across a menacing persona that certainly remains there both on and off screen throughout. Even though 48 Hrs. is entertaining, it is only so because there is a nagging feeling at the back of the head that it's too familiar. Some of the decisions and reactions certain characters take and react to are fishy to say the least. One such scene near the beginning sees a police man on the stairs, bloody and shot, attempting to gun down a bad guy: he has no bullets despite being off screen for a clear few minutes; did he not bother to check the chamber? Also, that same character decides to merely stand there when certain death looms and he is defenceless despite having a certain amount of time to get out of the situation. These scenes, like in any film, are incidental to the build up of the evil and menace of the antagonist who is the one that eventually kills him.Despite being involving and occasionally funny, the action scenes are messy and feel heavy handed at times with too many character a little too trigger happy. One character would rather shoot at Cates as he enters the apartment without any mention of anything: he knows he's a cop (not sure how) and would prefer to murder him there and then than talk or merely initially run away. But this character is Luther (Kelly) and it is he who remains a constant and entertaining focus for the films middle segment. Everything seems to revolve around him as the antagonists have kidnapped his girlfriend as insurance; immediately having the audience 'side' with him. Luther acts as the reason for the cops and the robbers to combine in action sequences; the train station being a good example as well as the fetching of the car from the garage.If there are major complaints, it's that Hammond's re-occurring joke about wanting to have sex just goes too far; before long becoming insulting to the women he is talking to. There is also the very obvious air of the film dipping once it seems all is lost and the good guys have lost: but wait, the bus that they were in; wasn't it from a certain place the cops know of? Let's go there and check. Sure enough, it gets them back on track as the film enters its final act. 48 Hrs. is a lot of fun but do not expect to be blown away by action or really witty dialogue. Likewise; these days this film is very 'buddy-by-numbers'.",48 Hrs.

The movie is well plotted, even though we know we are walking that predictable path, to where the next scene will take us, like a lot of eighties movies did. On a quest for revenge, for two cops dying, in front of his eyes, is hot dog cop, Jack Cates (Nolte giving us another great character performance). They were killed by escaped and very dangerous prisoner, Ganz, (a splendid James Remar) and buddy, Billy Bear (Sonny Landham) who sprung his mate out. Cates enlists help from prisoner/expert thief, Reggie Hammond (Murphy) who he takes into his custody for 48 hours. He has ties with our dangerously violent cop killers, who are after this money, Reggie has stashed away somewhere. Reggie wants to protect his money, Nolte just wants to blow our murderous duo away. Featuring quite a bit of Commando music, a lot of hostility and hate, not just from Nolte, that doesn't take s..t, a bit of violence, a little t and a from some hot broads, this is a hard edged cop film, featuring other good performances too, like David E Kelly, as the luckless loser, Luther, who in one scene, Murphy, causes a considerable amount of pain too. Overall what I love is, that 48 HRS is a cop film with a great recipe of comedy and drama, entwined, Murphy, who we have to thank a lot of this. Murphy is given a lot of great lines to work with: a lot of snappy cutting remarks. Both two leads are at the top of their game in one of the best partnerships in film I've seen. The bare knuckle fight between the two is hilarious. I really loved the character Nolte created, though, his attitudes towards some women here, was kind of off putting. A tight shot I loved was a CU of Nolte's car approaching a steep San Francisco street decline, among some other captured ones in the film. Nolte's moment of vengeance was fantastic few words, while also I liked him, defending Murphy, in front of his colleagues. This was one of the strongest moments in the film, while also being another great acting moment of Nolte's. This is a well shaped, compacted actioner, and another reminder of those unforgotten and well made '83 flicks. I mean films.",48 Hrs.
44,GOWBTW,The finest of buddy flicks known!,10,27 March 2008,"Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte strike it rich in ""48 Hours"". Eddie Murphy play Reggie Hammond, a smooth-talking, wise cracking, parolee who teams up with Jack Cates(Nolte), a hard-drinking, hard-nosed, and sloppy-looking policeman. During a gunfight Cates loses his piece to a dangerous killer. And it's up to Hammond to help him bring him down. Reggie has got 48 Hours to have him stopped before he runs amok again. The killer is Albert Ganz(James Remar) he and his partner Billy Bear(Sonny Lantham) go on a killing spree all over San Francisco. Cates and Hammond don't really get along with each other in the beginning, when the smoke does settle they gain trust and respect for each other. In order to stop the dangerous duo, Reggie gets his own piece, and they go out to find and stop them. Reggie got Billy Bear, even when he defied Reggie's warning. And Jack finally gets his man. The movie is hard core: Language, nudity, racial remarks, and violence. That doesn't bother me anymore. The real deal was the soundtrack. Especially ""The Boys are Back In Town"". 5 stars!",48 Hrs.

Eddie Murphy got a big break and shines in his role as Reggie Hammond and this film became one of the most copied comedy formulas during the 80's. Nick Nolte stars as Jack Cates whilst Anette O'Toole co-stars as Jack's long suffering girlfriend. James Remar and Sonny Landham also co-star as two of the most despicable criminals you'll ever want to meet. Denise Crosby has a small role as well.Walter Hill (protege of Sam Peckinpah) directs.A nasty cold blooded criminal Ganz (James Remar) escapes from a chain gang with the help of his Indian crime partner (Sonny Landham). The two fugitives cross paths with harden police inspector Jack Cates (Nick Nolte). After a bloody shoot out in a hotel lobby, Cates is desperate and will do anything to get the two. Whilst in the local precient, a learns that the two have a former crime partner Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) who's locked up in Folsom Prison. After pulling a few illegal strings, he uses Reggie to get back at his former running partners. Will Reggie follow suit or is Cates just wasting his time. He better hurry because he only has ""48 hours"".Highly entertaining film from Walter Hill. Eddie Murphy shows the world what a huge talent he is. Nick Nolte re-invents himself and his career ( something that a lot of middle or lower tier actors will do in the near future i.e. Gary Busey).

Go out and rent 48 Hrs. and have yourself a very good time!Recommended.B+The cable T.V. version (i.e T.N.T. and T.B.S.) have several new scenes (to fill out the running time) and a couple of extended ones as well.

Cates has Hammond on loan to him for 48 hours so it's very much a race against time to track down these murderous punks....48 Hours was the film that kick started Eddie Murphy's acting career and made him one of the most bankable stars of the 1980's. Watching his performance in this film it's very easy to see why; Murphy just had so much energy and was just so much fun to watch that often I could find myself forgiving some of the weaker areas in many of his films. I still liked Murphy in this film and thought he was fun to watch but...I didn't think that much of the story to be honest; it's a rather weak and unfocused affair; the baddies are in the film at the start and then disappear for an hour and then they only show up towards the end to wrap the film up. In the early stages this is OK because it allows for Murphy and Nolte to trade insults and kick off with each other. Like I say this is fun at first, but in mismatched buddy films the characters hatred for one another should form part of the story rather than engulfing the film and sadly the latter aspect is what occurs here. The story has no real depth, the baddies have no development and sadly that means that we're left with nearly 90 minutes of Murphy and Nolte trading insults - like I say it's fun at first, but wears thin.The directing here is also a bit hit-and-miss as well; the film wasn't as action packed as I was expecting and coupled with the rather weak and undeveloped story this was never as good as it could have been. The true selling point here lies with Nolte and Murphy who were both very good and played off one another very well.48 Hours isn't a terrible film by any means and the chemistry between Murphy and Nolte was pretty good. Unfortunately, the director put too much focus on them and not enough focus on anything else. This results in a film that is fun for a while, but does get a little repetitive and tiresome from time to time.",48 Hrs.

49,barnabyrudge,"The original - and probably the best - of the ""buddy-buddy"" flicks.",7,28 November 2004,"Walter Hill is one of those directors who seems never to make an average film. His movies are, generally-speaking, either very good or very bad. 48 Hours is one of his ""very good"" offerings. It gives Eddie Murphy one of cinema's most unforgettable movie debuts, and invents the conventions of the buddy cop genre that were to become blueprints for years to come. Every buddy picture after 1982 - including Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Fled, Bad Boys, and a thousand more - owes something to 48 Hours.The film opens with psychopathic Albert Ganz (James Remar) escaping from a chain gang. Determined to track down Ganz, tough cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) springs a fast-talking convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from jail for forty-eight hours, during which time the mismatched duo must find their quarry. Cates doesn't like blacks, and Hammond doesn't like cops, so before they can even get to the business of tracking down their man they first have to come to terms with working alongside each other.Fast-paced, energetic, foul-mouthed and funny, 48 Hours is simply a great ride. Nolte underplays brilliantly, wisely allowing Murphy to handle the loud and showy role while he etches a gruff, rugged characterisation as a cop on the warpath. The leading characters are rounded off wonderfully by James Remar, as a genuinely bad ""baddie"". If the plot to 48 Hours sounds like a collection of all the clichés and predictabilities that ruin most films, it's important to remember that before this film nothing like it had really been done. These plot devices and conventions are only considered ""cliches"" nowadays because 48 Hours was so influential, not to mention frequently-imitated, in the ensuing years. James Horner's music score is perfectly judged too. Finally, no review of 48 Hours would be complete without some acknowledgment of the film's most famous scene. I'm talking - of course - about the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn't so. It really is an electrifying screen moment.... in a film that really is an electrifying screen experience!",48 Hrs.
50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,The original buddy cop flick. Accept no substitutes.,10,8 March 2016,"Walter Hill's bawdy buddy cop classic 48 Hrs is for me the original and best entry in the sub genre. Countless films since have attempted to re create the aesthetic which was so purely and profanely distilled here. I think one of the reasons it worked so well is because one of the duo isn't even a cop at all, but a fast talking ex con played by Eddie Murphy with exquisite comic timing and bullet-time verbosity in what was one of his first roles. He's paired with a gruff, grunting Nick Nolte as Jack Cates, a spectacularly bad tempered Detective who is forced to bring along Murphy's gabber mouthed Reggie Hammond on a mad goose chase of a hunt for two staggeringly homicidal criminals. The entirety of the film is peppered with nostalgically anti-PC banter between the two, delightfully distasteful stuff that would never make it into a studio movie in this, the day and age of the offended millennial whiner. These two guys genuinely dislike each other for the majority of the film, and get so caught up in their petty feuds and arguing that they actually get distracted from their case, taking interludes to literally beat each other up in an alley. Nolte is perfect as the irresponsible hotshot with anger issues up the wazoo and a penchant for reckless behaviour. Murphy doesn't let up with the mile-a-minute yakking for one second of screen time, making damn sure his performance makes an impression. And it did, putting him on the map in a big way, and forging a career playing these types of dudes. James Remar has never been scarier, crafting a villain so psychopathic and dangerous he'd rather shoot cops and terrorize civilians that enjoy a hooker he picks up. The look of pure malice on his face as he coldly puts a bullet in a poor officer is chilling. He's Albert Ganz, heinous prison escapee on the run with equally nasty compadre Billy Bear (The legendary Sonny Landham). The two prove to be a raging juggernaut of violence for Jack and Reggie to contend with, providing some crackling action set pieces including a chase scene set on a speeding San Francisco cable car that will give your TV a good workout. There's supporting work from solid players including some Hill favourites. David Patrick Kelly plays an unsavoury associate of Ganz's, Annette O Toole is Jack's poor neglected love interest, and there's work from Chris Mulkey, Jonathan Banks, Frank McCrae and the late Brion James as well. When it comes to buddy cop flicks, this is the original and accept no substitutes. The two leads have never been funnier or more committed to such a heightened pair of performances. Hill drives the direction with snappy, ruthless precision where the laughs hit with the same stinging impact as the full throttle violence and wanton obscenities hurled across the screen. It holds up just as well today as it did back in the 80's, and is always ripe for a revisit.",48 Hrs.

52,gcd70,Wild Ride,6,15 February 2008,"Walter Hill's ""48 HRS"" is highly regarded as one of the best cop-buddy movies ever to grace the screen. Why? Well for starters you have a director who knows exactly how to turn his own tense yet hilarious screenplay (co-written with Roger Spottiswoode, Larry Gross and Steven E. De Souza) into a wild ride full of riotous comedy and abundant action, gunplay and violence.Art Director John Vallone has fashioned some foreboding sets in which several nervy scenes unfold, while D.P. Ric Waite captures all the goings on with style, giving ""48 HRS"" a realistic edge. Then there's the editing team of Freeman Davies, Mark Warner and Billy Weber who maintain the pic's fast tempo without a problem.Of course the obvious reason for this movie's success is the matching up of newcomer Eddie Murphy with rough, tough Nick Nolte. The pair exchange no beg pardons as they attempt to join forces (cop and con) in order to apprehend two desperate crims who have shot prison guards and police officers in trying to avoid capture. A sublime teaming indeed! Watching Nolte and Murphy engage in verbal and physical tete-a-tetes is a real pleasure and provides both much of ""48 HRS"" entertainment and almost all of its comedy.Nick Nolte is always at his best in the 'tough guy who just might be a person underneath role', while Eddie Murphy's film debut is a delight, his trademark performance still being one of his very best.

53,dworldeater,One of the best,10,23 December 2019,"48 Hours is easily the best buddy comedy action flick there is. Tough cop Jack Cates and wise cracking convict Reggie Hammond(Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy) team up to take down ruthless criminal Albert Ganz and his buddy Billy bear(James Remar and Sonny Landham). 48 Hours is fast paced,gritty and tough. In this violent world of cops and thieves there are still lots of funny jokes mixed with the fights and shootouts. This along with The Warriors is director Walter Hill's most successful and most memorable film work. James Remar is one of the best villains I have seen totally cold blooded and ruthless(and hard as nails). In my opinion, he is massively underrated as an actor and his performance here is absolutely balls out and bad ass. Sonny Landham is also great here as heavy as well. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are also great and play off each other perfectly. Walter Hill is one of my all time favorite directors and here he was really cooking with one of my favorite action movies ever. 48 Hours delivers as great entertainment and was very influential to future action movies and holds up really well as some 1st rate violent and tough entertainment.",48 Hrs.
54,aidanratesmovies,A Decent Buddy Cop Flick,8,9 August 2020,"Entertaining and fun, but with an average storyline that weighs down the talented performances, 48 Hrs. may not be a perfect buddy cop film, but it certainly is a very enjoyable one. Eddie Murphy shines in his breakout role as Reggie Hammond, as his hilarious and fast talking attributes finally get the screen time they deserve. Nick Nolte also provides a decent performance as Jack Cates, a rugged cop, who can be at times a bit cliche, even for the time, but still makes the most out of his role. The film can be a bit generic, mainly in the writing department, as its story is very basic, as well as the situations our characters find themselves in. What is very unique about the film, is Nolte and Murphy's chemistry throughout the film, and the majority of their ad libbed lines that I always found myself grinning throughout. The film may not have aged very well, especially in light of recent events in our times, but for those who are willing to put those problems of the film aside, the film can be very easy to watch, and quite a blast. 48 Hrs. is not the most original film, but it can be quite fun, and I wouldn't mind catching it again sometime in the future.

This film is basically the Odd Couple with guns and excellently choreographed gunplay action. No really, the action is great. And the film is funny without trying to be funny, which is a mistake made by the sequel which I'm going to watch and review next.

56,PredragReviews,"""So it's just Screw Reggie Hammond?""",9,13 May 2016,"It is a true classic, highlighting the true natural talent of Eddie Murphy. He and Nick Nolte play off each other well, and Nolte isn't too bad himself in the comedy department. Though his type of humor is much more subtle. He does get his digs in, on Mr. Murphy's expense, mind you. To the best of my knowledge, this was one of the first movies that combined excellent humor scenes with extreme violence and emotion. And while many tried to duplicate it, in later years, including other Eddie Murphy vehicles, such as ""Beverly Hills Cop"", nothing can compare to the original! However, the overall effort is marred by the thin plot and moments of such stupidity as to be jaw-dropping, rather than laugh inducing, especially concerning firearms and Nick Nolte's character, Jack Cates. What police officer of any training even if buzzed on whiskey complies with the order of a prime suspect in the murder of other law enforcement personnel to cede possession of his service weapon on the expectation of mercy? What police brass would not immediately remove this man from the force for negligent homicide of a fellow officer? Let alone give him another gun and put him back on the streets? Cates is one of the most inept hero characters I've seen on a screen. The crooks aren't that much smarter, though, since Cates manages to get them in the end with the help of his antagonistic convict partner, Reggie Hammond (Murphy), who's stupid enough to trust Cates with his loot. There are numerous exciting and hilarious moments, but none rival the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn't so.

Plot is threadbare: cop forced to temporarily spring a convict from prison, to help catch his escaped ex-partner in crime. Both characters are tolerable at best, racist and homophobic at worst, so it was difficult for me to care what happened to them. Also, the plot (with a screenplay begun by Roger Spottiswood, then fleshed out by Steven DeSouza, then adapted further during filming by Walter Hill & Larry Gross) almost completely falls apart if one thinks about it afterward. Some abrupt tone changes several times in the final scenes may be a result of the rewrites, and they don't help.I could now only recommend this for Eddie Murphy fans and/ or Nick Nolte fans (who have probably already seen it), or someone with an interest in San Francisco.",48 Hrs.
59,Howlin Wolf,Pretty entertaining thanks to great performances from the two leads...,7,12 April 2001,"It's the chemistry between Nolte and Murphy that makes this work, plus the fact that both men really attempt to 'get into the skin' of their character, something mostly ignored in other examples of this genre. Director Hill knows he's got a great team in front of the camera, and all that remains is for him to incorporate some spectacular action sequences around them.  This he does competently.  That one-two punch is what gives the movie its fireworks.   The banter and situations concerning the characters are also gleefully un-PC.  It'd be interesting to see what a studio and director would make of the same premise in these 'enlightened' times.  Murphy's comic stage persona is less restrained here than it would be in later films, and the results are often shamefully funny.   Don't expect Shakespeare, there's far too much cursing and other unsavoury shenanigans going on for that; do expect a pacy and entertaining early example of the 'buddy thriller'.",48 Hrs.
60,oneguyrambling,The very definition of a mis-matched duo.,7,1 March 2012,"Before 48 Hrs Eddie Murphy was that guy what were funny on the TV sometimes, with only a couple years on Saturday Night Live under his belt. Nick Nolte was actually the headliner for 48 Hrs with well over a decade of TV and films under his belt. Both are still acting, though Nolte has readily embraced his role playing status while Murphy has sullied his legend by steadfastly refusing to fade away, leading to a series of increasingly regrettable films with diminishing quality and box-office.I've said before there is a generation of kids who think Murphy is the voice of a donkey, who has parlayed Shrek into branching out into crap like Norbit, Meet Dave and Kid's stuff.The strength of 48 Hrs – make that both films – is that this is truly a mismatched duo. Nolte plays Jack Cates as a gruff, clumsy, violent man always with a smoke in one hand and a drink never far from the other.Cates is also not afraid to use physical and verbal bullying to get his way. He skirts the rules, ignores the reports and apparently is hellbent to get his man.Murphy on the other hand is Reggie Hammond, his mouth gets him into and out of trouble, he is slick, quick witted and resourceful and never short of an opinion.Cates is a cop on the hunt for a pair of convicts named Albert Ganz and a towering Native American named Billy Bear. The duo created a pile of bodies during their escape and are high priority targets. Cates logically thinks that it might help to quiz one of their still imprisoned ex-partners to plot where they might lie low Reggie Hammond is that ex-partner, and he reluctantly agrees only on the proviso that he might be released temporarily so he can use his street contacts and nous to locate Ganz and Billy. It turns out that Reggie also has reason for wanting the pair back in jail.There is genuine animosity between Cates and Hammond, as mentioned above Cates will do anything to keep Hammond in line, continually referring to him as 'convict' and worse in the 2000s this is rightfully abhorred but I guess even as recently as the early 1980s casual racism was still quite commonplace.Still with the friction well established the two move about San Fransisco trying to track down the violent escapees, with Reggie's rants and complaints getting constantly getting on Jack's nerves, often leading to predictable bouts of casual violence. (Somehow racism has become taboo but smacking guys around will always be funny.) There are more highlights than will usually be found in a 1980s movie – they mostly go 'Big intro nothing much for 40 minutes chase scene nothing for 20 minutes finale credits' – but the crowing glory might well be when Reggie rousts a redneck titty bar in a search for information and um temporary female companionship.The finale is essentially a 40 minute chase scene through the backstreets of San Fransisco towards a predictable yet satisfying conclusion.The soundtrack is solid and the kettle drum theme quite memorable decades later, and Walter Hill movies always have some of the more satisfying loud and crisp gunshot sound effects, and the recipients of said bullets always seem to manage to defy gravity to fly dozens of feet backwards some feet from the ground, often through windows.48 Hrs is efficiency and entertainment through simplicity, the action is noticeable for its realism and lack of unnecessary flair, the numerous jokes come in the flow of the film and not at the expense of the story, and the very fact that Hammond and Cates are so different as individuals provides for consistent tension, often providing more violence and trash talking.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. 48 Hrs might not spring to mind when thinking about the 'classics of the 80s', but it is worth noting that this was one of the pioneering mis-matched buddy action flicks, and it is worth a look even 3 decades on – especially when compared with the stuff Murphy has released in the last decade.",48 Hrs.
61,seymourblack-1,"Entertaining, Influential & Fantastically Successful",9,29 July 2015,"The incredible box office success of ""48 Hours"" was attributable to its brilliant combination of action, pace and comedy and the pairing of a couple of guys whose relationship was a continuous source of entertainment. This formula proved to be so successful that it blazed the trail for the whole genre of ""buddy cop movies"" that followed. ""48 Hours"" was also significant, however, for being Eddie Murphy's first film and the one that made him into an instant star.Detective Sergeant Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) is a tough San Francisco cop who's out for revenge after two of his colleagues are killed by escaped convicts Albert Ganz (James Remar) and Billy Bear (Sonny Landham) in a shootout at a local apartment building. Jack's investigations soon reveal that another member of their gang is still in prison serving a three-year sentence for robbery and so he arranges for Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) to be released on a 48 hour pass so that he can help to track down the two killers.Reggie proves to be useful in assisting Jack's pursuit of Ganz and Bear who'd killed a couple of guards when they broke out of prison and are now intent on finding the $500,000 that they stole before being sent to jail. Reggie discloses that the money was stashed away in the trunk of his car which had been parked in a garage for the 30 months that he'd been in prison. Predictably though, Jack and Reggie's mission to recover the money and bring Ganz and Bear to justice within the 48 hours available, proves to be both challenging and extremely dangerous.The relationship between Jack and Reggie is so highly-charged as it develops from open hostility to mutual respect (and eventually friendship) that it becomes absolutely fascinating to watch. It's also incredibly funny because they're so different and their interactions are so abrasive. The dialogue is sharp, witty and often coarse and when they trade insults (in pre-politically correct language) their brilliantly-written quick-fire exchanges are delivered with tremendous panache.Nick Nolte is excellent as the gruff, hard-drinking detective who chain-smokes, always looks dishevelled and has a totally dysfunctional relationship with his badly-treated girlfriend Elaine (Annette O'Toole). Eddie Murphy is sensational as Reggie, who's a fast-talking, wisecracking, smartly-dressed ladies man with a lot of attitude and reasons of his own for being prepared to help Jack. Murphy's first appearance in the movie is very memorable because of the excruciating way in which he sings ""Roxanne"" and the now-legendary scene in which he takes control of a redneck bar while posing as a police officer is still terrific and laugh-out-loud funny.In retrospect, it's clear that, as well as being a fantastically successful movie that's hugely entertaining, ""48 Hours"" also proved to be far more influential than anyone could possibly have imagined at the time of its original release.",48 Hrs.

63,brchthethird,"The original buddy cop movie, and still one of the best",9,14 November 2014,"This is an all-thrills, no frills buddy action comedy with excellent performances by Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. One of the beauties (and source of some faults) of this movie is its simplicity. The plot is rather straightforward and doesn't stop too long or too often for exposition, which is good. However, a lot of the characters are underwritten, most notably the villain who gets a worthy introduction but isn't seen too much until the inevitable climax. Nick Nolte's girlfriend is also underwritten and seems to serve little purpose other than to give him something else to bitch about. However, Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy's characters are very well-defined and developed, and their chemistry is what makes the movie so special. Eddie Murphy really hit it out of the park with this film, his feature debut. There's a lot of great action and comedic scenes, but my favorite has to be when Eddie Murphy takes on a bar full of rednecks. What transpires is truly hilarious, and an excellent character-building moment. Also, since the movie moves along so quickly, you never get bored watching what happens on screen. My last complaint would be that the film is resolved maybe a little too quickly, but it still was a satisfying ending, nonetheless. I should also mention that this movie has a killer soundtrack, with one particularly good song by The Busboys, (The Boys Are) Back In Town, which is a rollicking good blues rock tune. All-in-all, this is a must-see 1980's action-comedy made by movie veterans at the top of their game (just check out the writers on this thing).",48 Hrs.
64,mattymatt4ever,The real thing. Accept no imitations.,9,15 January 2003,"This is the one of the movies that kicked off the buddy cop formula. Technically, Nick Nolte's the only cop, but other films have tried to imitate the style by having a tough, cranky, by-the-book cop (Nolte's character) paired off with a loose, easygoing, unorthodox cop (like Murphy's character).  Some of these ""imitators"" have failed miserably and even those that succeeded don't match up to ""48 Hours.""  I haven't seen the unedited version of this movie in over ten years (it plays on TV like 4 times every month), and even when I did catch it on TV, I caught it in bits and pieces.  Now that I've seen it straight-through, in its uncut form, I can regard this as an overlooked classic.  Watching Nolte as the gruff, chain-smoking Jack, I thought to myself, ""He owns that part."" Many actors have tried to take on that same role, but nobody plays it better than Nolte.  And the same goes for Eddie Murphy.  His talent has been taken for granted over the recent years, since his career has hit a major slump. And rightfully so.  He should choose his roles much more wisely.  How do you from doing such fun, memorable films as ""48 Hours,"" ""Coming to America"" and ""Trading Places"" to doing ""Showtime"" and ""I-Spy.""  This movie proves that Murphy can go leaps and bounds with his comic talent, if the script is well-written.  The scene in the all-white, country-western bar, where Murphy shows off his skills as an interrogator, is a classic. 
The film is directed by Walter Hill, who's great at directing action sequences.  So the movie packs a punch in both the action and comedy department.  Nolte and Murphy's chemistry is priceless, and the banter between them is sharp and hilarious.  One of my favorite examples is when Murphy asks Nolte, ""Can you tell me a bedtime story?""  Nolte responds, ""F**k you.""  ""That's my favorite one.""  Of course, Murphy gets most of the credit for being the comic relief, and he is terrific in one of his best comic performances, but Nolte belts out just as many funny lines as him, though he's the official straight man.  He never seems to say anything intentionally funny, but that's what's funny.  He says things that are hilarious, but sounds dead serious about them.  And of course, it's also hilarious to watch him react furiously to Murphy's taunts. 
Those who haven't seen ""48 Hours"" should really check it out, because it's an action classic!  Sure, the ""Rush Hour"" films are good, but Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan don't have close to the same magic as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy!  THIS is how an action/comedy is made!!My score:  9 (out of 10)",48 Hrs.
65,ivo-cobra8,"An action classic, best and the only original buddy cop flick from the 80's!",10,1 April 2016,"48 Hrs. (1982) is an action classic the only original best buddy cop flick from the 80's. Is an action cop flick that I love to death and it was honestly the first action film I saw as a kid. I grew up watching this film and in my opinion is still my favorite action buddy flick. This is first time we see Eddie Murphy in action before he went in making Beverly Hills Cop (1984), beside Beverly Hills Cop this is one if his best movies of the 80's. It is actually my favorite Walter Hill film. Like I said I grew up watching this film, I loved 48 Hrs. so much that I hardly convinced my mom to watch this movie with me and the sequel of this film. I read on Charles Bronson's Murphy's Law (1986) flick that the storyline of that film the pairing a cop with a convict was popular in Hollywood during the 1980s after the success of this film 48 Hrs. (1982). Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are sensational in this film, the action is great and the plot about this film is well paced it goes fast and it is entertaining. I really enjoy watching this movie and honestly I love it more, than I would love the sequel, the sequel can't even hold a candle to this film.""Yeah. Well, I'm real impressed with you too, man. It takes a real-skilled cop to kick in the bedroom door of a couple of dykes!""Plot: A hard-nosed cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him, in order to track down a killer.The film is actually about a $500,000 stashed cash and two cop killers who are running around and killing cop,s while they want to get the hands of this cash. A tough cop who is a survivor in a shoot out in the hotel from those two killers, pairs with a convict from prison to help him to get and catch those two killers. They only have 48 Hrs. before the cop has to bring the convict back. They don't make films like this anymore, I really love action films from the 80's and this one was the first one I have saw as a kid. My favorite part in the film is the stake out scene: Jack (Nick Nolte) and Reggie (Eddie Murphy) head out to the parking garage, and they park across the street from the parking garage, waiting till the parking garage opens which it does around 7.00 am in the mornings and they spend the night there. Next morning Jack (Nick Nolte) brings a café drink to Reggie (Eddie Murphy) and wakes him up. The similar thing happened to me when I was 12 years old. My mom drove me and my dad with the car in the city 4.00 am in the mornings it was night than and my dad went with his bike delivering news paper, me with my mom waited on him in the car till his shift ends. During the waiting I fall a sleep, when I woke it was past 7.00 am and my mom brought me food from the store in the car. That moment I remember this scene in this film. It is a beautiful child memories of mine on my mom and 48 Hrs. (1982) is my childhood movie and it is memories on my childhood. 48 Hrs. and Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2 are my favorite Eddie Murphy films from my childhood that I love to death.This is Nick Nolte's best action flick that I love to death and only one that is worth to watch. I love Music theme by James Horner that I love so much including the opening scene that was awesome. Honestly James Horner made the same music theme for Commando (1985) Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie. I love the shout outs, the action scenes, the dialogues and I also love the main lead roles from Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond are my favorite characters. This is the only original action film, but I think it was unnecessary making a sequel (Another 48 Hrs.) that I honestly think Nick Nolte made a lousy awful job reprising his role and Eddie Murphy was even worst by shouting and punching Nick Nolte. Before I finish my review you have a few cast that are memorable here: You have: James Remar from Dexter playing the main villain, David Patrick Kelly from Commando and The Warriors, Sonny Landham from Predator, Annette O'Toole from Smallville, Jonathan Banks from Beverly Hills Cop and Olivia Brown from Miami Vice. I have this film on Blu-ray I used to own the DVD but I switch it for Blu-ray.48 Hrs. is a 1982 American action comedy film directed by Walter Hill, starring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his film debut and Golden Globe Award-nominated role) as a cop and convict, respectively, who team up to catch a cop-killer. The title refers to the amount of time they have to solve the crime.Overall: Is my favorite action flick from my childhood and I love it to death. This flick get's a solid 10 by me and it deserves it.",48 Hrs.
66,russem31,Great cop movie.,7,9 May 2006,"""48 Hours"", a movie directed by Walter Hill (he will also direct the sequel ""Another 48 Hours"" hits the right notes with this cop movie. Nick Nolte (who plays Jack Cates) is forced to team up with a hardened criminal (Eddie Murphy as Reggie Hammond in his first film role, one that helped make him a movie star) for 48 hours in order to track down a murderer. And it is their character interaction that makes this action movie work - it's fun to watch them at each other's necks as they muddle through the streets trying to find their foe. On the music front, composer James Horner, in one of his first major films, creates a suitable theme (that will be further explored in the sequel). A 7 out of 10.",48 Hrs.
67,Maziun,Great and underrated action comedy,8,19 August 2013,"It makes me sad , that such a great movie doesn't have even a 7.0 rating. What is wrong with you , people ? It's a classic ! The whole movie even after all those years has a sense of freshness in it . It is based on original idea about cop working with thief to catch bandits. Usually an action comedy is a buddy cop movie when two cops with different personalities try to work together solving a case (""Lethal weapon"" , ""Red heat"", "", ""Tango and Cash"" and so on ) . The idea of making a cop work with thief is brilliant , because it allows us to watch the struggle between people from two different worlds (law and crime ) not two people from one world (law). It opens up new possibilities for fun and the movie uses the idea to the maximum.Nick Nolte (Jack Cates) and Eddie Murphy (Reggie Hammond) are brilliant together . They have great chemistry and each one of them shines in his role . Some people say that Murphy overshadows Nolte , but I don't agree . Yes , the ""48 hours"" was the movie that started Eddie's career , but it was a team effort . After all , when you think of Nolte , you probably think of ""48 hours"" first.It's Nolte's most recognizable role and one of his best performances . He's great as aggressive, cynical , burned out and brutal cop . Murphy also makes his character much more than a typical ""funny black guy who is a comic relief"" role , that often appears in action movies. His Reggie Hammond is a thief with strong sense of elegance , pride and weakness for pick pocketing. Together both are fun to watch as they argue and slowly become friends.James Remar (Ganz) , David Patrick Kelly (Luther) and Sonny Landhan (Billy Bear) all were very convincing as the dangerous criminals . Frank McRae was big fun as typical ""big black boss yelling at our heroes"" . I was in tears , when he was shouting at Cates and Hammond ! Brion James (""Blade runner"") has a supporting role as Kehoe – a friend cop of Cates . Annette O'Toole plays an instrumental role of Cates angry girlfriend Elaine. Too bad , the movie could use her more.Funny fact – Jonathan Banks plays here a small , but important role of good cop. He doesn't have a scene with Murphy , but he appears in ""Beverly Hills cop"" as a thug.The movie is a powerful mix of action and comedy . The two outstanding scenes are the bet between Hammond and Cates (""There's a new sheriff in town"") and the bus chase . Especially the first scene is wonderful , because it explains why Murphy was so awesome in the 80's.A really good script combined with top notch acting and a confident direction from Walter Hill make this movie a winner . It's more in style of ""Lethal weapon"" than ""Beverly Hills cop"" . Remember that . Also remember the great song from Bus Boys ""The boys are back in town"". And don't forget to watch this classic movie . I give it 8/10.",48 Hrs.
68,RonellSowes,Created the 'buddy cop' movie,5,8 December 2020,"Many attribute the creation of the buddy cop subgenre to 48 Hours. In this film however, both of them are not police officers in fact one of them is a criminal brought out of jail. But it wasn't just a plot that this film started but a style. Whith one of them being serious and all business while the other is more light and diverting and the comedy is generated from the personality clash;this formula has been copied ever since in films like Rush Hour,Tango & Cash,Red Heat and Men In Black to name a few. Eddie Murphy started off as a comedian,not as if he's become much else,and is well suited for his role. He can make you laugh with lines that you would look pass entirely if delivered by most other actors. And then there's Nick Nolte as the 'hard boiled detective'. Nolte is a fairly large man with a gruff face but still he just isn't that believable in this role. He's better cast as characters like the flustered father in Cape Fear than a tough cop.The film was both written and directed by Walter Hill who certainly had an affinity for cop flicks. Ten years previously he wrote the film Hickey & Boggs and then in 1988 the above mentioned Red Heat starring Arnold Scwarzenegger.48 Hours was a film that started an entire type of movie of which it is still one of the better installments.",48 Hrs.
69,manitobaman81,Good,7,1 September 2014,"A poignant, gripping story that glues you to your seat from the start to the end. The movie itself is nothing that special, but it has some good stuff. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those sombre Canadian films that were popular back in the 1980s. Actually, I don't know what to think of this little film made far from Hollywood. An awesome, good surprise for me this little movie was, so that I highly recommend it. Rating: 7 out of 10.",48 Hrs.

Quite simply, the two stars do their best, but they are given nothing to work with here.  The action is routine, the laughs are rare, and the ending is very predictable.  That is not to say that this is a bad movie, but it isn't a good movie, either.  It's just...well...a movie.",48 Hrs.
71,PersianPlaya408,Decent Buddy Cop Type film from the 80s,7,8 August 2005,"48 Hours was one of the reasons for Murphys fame. One of Murphys better films, its a story about a cop who wants to find a killer so bad that he temporarily releases a criminal (murphy) to help find him. NOlte is decent in this movie, although I thought he was trying a bit too hard to be like Clint Eastwood or Dirty Harry i should say. Eddie Murphy gave best performance as Reggie a fast-talking smooth criminal, Murphy steals most of his scenes, almost as good as he was in Beverly HIlls Cop (that was his absolute best). This movie had some decent action for 1982 times, but not great, and the suspense was a bit odd, but decent. I thought the direction could have been better but it was an interesting script, and Murphys improvisations helped the film a lot. 7/10",48 Hrs.

The key feature of the film is its aggressively in-your-face foul language. Every third word is p*ssy, m*therf*cker, d*ck, *ssh*le, trim(sex) or n*gger. It is a very violent film with many scenes of women being held hostage in gun battles, and people being gratuitously killed or beaten to a pulp.Most of the action takes place in sleazy night spots in San Francisco, with plenty of bumping and grinding female flesh.They have a great band who does ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" and other get up and dance songs.

There is alot of bad buddy cop movies, this is one of the best. Considering one is a cop and the other is a convict it shouldn't really be considered a buddy cop movie. I watched this film a couple of days ago because it had been awhile since I watched it a thousand times on cable television as a kid. I was surprised at the amount of racial comments made in this film, I guess as a child I didn't really pay attention to those comments. The movie is still solid, definitely one of Walter Hill's best films. Eddie Murphy is perfecting his onscreen personality in his first film. Beverley Hills Cop wasn't far behind. Nick Nolte feels like a tired detective in this film. Nolte has always seemed like the perfect tired private eye or detective to me. The rough voice, the lined and aged face, he just seems right. The movie is exciting and tight, one of the best action films of the eighties.",48 Hrs.
74,RossRivero99,One of the best buddy cop action movies i've ever seen,9,11 June 2017,"While watching Walter Hill's ""48 Hrs."" I was reminded of watching Richard Donner's ""Lethal Weapon"" (1987) even though the two stories are pretty similar but mostly different. Nick Nolte stars as Jack Cates a hard nosed, tough guy cop that just survived a hotel shooting that killed two cops and has no help in assisting him to go after the criminals that were responsible, but the help that Cates gets is from an unlikely source. After the shooting Cates goes to the local jail to get help from a convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy, in his debut role) to arrest the three men in only 2 days. The movie is one of the best police movies that I've seen in a long time, with an intelligent screenplay, with frequently hilarious dialogue and excellent performances from both Nolte and Murphy. Nolte's performance is comparable with Danny Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"", Steve McQueen in ""Bullitt"", Gene Hackman in ""The French Connection"", and Clint Eastwood in the ""Dirty Harry"" series. While Murphy's performance reminded me of Mel Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon"" despite the fact that in the movie that Gibson played a drug addicted and suicidal cop. Hill's direction and his screenplay that he wrote with Roger Spottiswoode, Larry Gross, and Steven De Souza is really effective in letting us to get to know the characters and also tells the story in an efficient way. While especially the scenes between Cates and his wife (Annette O'Toole) are very emotionally effective and authentic. In conclusion because of all those reasons this is one of 1982's very best films.",48 Hrs.
75,catpantry,'nolte plays a servent',10,15 October 2019,Through out the film we see Nolte drinking from a flask and smoking cigarettes as he drives his bathtub car around the city like an animal. He retains a 'messenger of the good' purpose like a run down hog being hurt. It was funny. He was mean to eddy murphys character. Nolte enlisted eddy to help in terms of capturing the bad guy (who was real nasty). At one point eddy was sleeping in the car during a stake out and Nolte arrives with coffee and slams eddys seat to wake him up. That was sad and funny. The dialogue between the two is clap worthy. The movie is worth watching. I happened to catch it on TV after having a rough day in my city.,48 Hrs.
76,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review solid but showing its age,5,30 March 2002,"I enjoyed this film when it originally came out, but I believe comments should reflect the times and when I caught this on TV 20 years later, it had aged.This was Eddy Murphy's first movie. He's good. Nick Nolte is good. In 1982, this was quite the cop buddy film. Compared with modern standards in witty dialogue and action, the film still holds up but does not compete with Rush Hour, or even Beverly Hills Cop. The plot is solid and not goofy, but not especially compelling or clever either.Therefore, I would not recommend this movie as a straight comedy, nor to youngsters who have no reason to reminisce about the early 80's. Rent ""Trading Places"" instead, Eddy Murphy's 2nd film, which is still a classic, or see ""Showtime"".Who should see this film:-- Eddy Murphy fans who just have to see all his films-- Action lovers who have nothing better to do on a rainy day and would like to reminisce about the early 80s-- I can't think of anyone elseI rate ""48 Hrs"" a 5 out of 10.",48 Hrs.

79,romanorum1,A Lively Duo,6,26 January 2016,"A murderous convict, Albert Ganz (James Remar), with the help of accomplice Indian Billy Bear (Sonny Landham), bursts out of chain gang after killing two guards. The convicts go to San Francisco and grab an old acquaintance, slimy Luther (David Patrick Kelly) and his girl. They want the money that he is supposedly holding, and as insurance hold the sleaze-ball's girlfriend hostage until the cash is delivered. The convicts hole up in a shady hotel and order prostitutes. Meanwhile our hero – cranky, gruff, and tough detective – Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) and two plainclothesmen surge into the hotel room. Nonetheless the situation goes badly for the lawmen as the two cops are killed and the hoodlums escape. At the police station, Cates is given grief by his immediate superior Haden (Frank McRae) who rants and raves (and overreacts in all of his scenes). One of the prostitutes, lovely Lisa (Greta Blackburn) – who earlier had exposed her beautiful breasts – says to a policewoman, ""I think he's going to give you guys a hard time."" When asked why, she quips, ""I just think he likes shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.""Determined to track down the two thugs, Cates is forced to turn to convicted thief and hustler Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) for help. Rather easily, he gets Hammond a two-day parole from jail (in his custody) to assist him. Hammond is also after Ganz. Seems these two stole money from a drug dealer several years earlier, and Ganz is determined to grab the whole stash. So the rest of the movie focuses on two mismatched guys – Cates and Hammond – who hate each other. Cates likes to utter racial epithets; Hammond hates cops. Hammond puts it plainly, ""We ain't brothers, we ain't partners, and we ain't friends."" Over two days though, the two men gradually develop a mutual respect for each other as they traverse various places around town in a convertible Cadillac looking for information that leads to the two fugitives. Near the end there is a thrilling chase and shootout involving a public bus and convertible. The main gripe along the way is this scenario: The fight between the two protagonists in the alley is long and Murphy comes out of it looking a little too good. His suit is hardly ruffled. The much larger Nolte looks worse. Nevertheless, Nolte and Murphy are sensational as a team, as there is great chemistry between them. By the way, this movie is Murphy's debut. On the other side, Remar and Landham play sufficiently psychotic and violent goons. The movie's non-stop sharp dialog and the music of the Busboys are pluses.",48 Hrs.
80,Cinemaniac1984,They don't make movies like 48 Hrs. anymore.,9,29 July 2015,"48 Hrs. had the right stuff in an action/comedy that worked perfectly. It's violent, foul mouthed, and there are laughs aplenty. It is hard to see these types of movies nowadays with the political correctness and Hollywood's main aim to attract wider audiences with toned down movies. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his feature film debut) created a great chemistry as the hard nosed cop and fast talking criminal who are made reluctant partners to bring down a common enemy. Director Walter Hill has done a fine job and his midas touch with bringing gritty action movies to the big screen is sorely missed.The movie starts with Billy Bear (Sonny Landham, Predator) breaking Albert Ganz (James Remar, The Warriors) out of prison by staging a fight and killing three prison guards. Two days later, SFPD Inspector Jack Cates (Nick Nolte, Cape Fear) and two other detectives track down Albert Ganz and Billy Bear hiding out at the Walden Hotel in downtown San Francisco which ends in a bloodbath and two of the police detectives accompanying Cates are killed.Jack Cates is determined to bring down Albert Ganz and Billy Bear but must also enlist the help of a fast talking hustler Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy, Trading Places) to help track down Ganz and Billy who was also previously associated with the crazed criminals. Ganz and Billy are also killing off their previous associates and have kidnapped the girlfriend of another associate Luther (David Patrick Kelly, Commando) to find $500,000 that has been mysteriously stashed away in a hiding spot. Tracking down the crazed criminals won't be easy given that Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond have already developed an antagonistic relationship.In Eddie Murphy's feature film debut, he explodes onto the scene in a huge way, and his comedic talents have not been wasted for one moment. Nick Nolte as Jack Cates plays it perfectly as the straight man who doesn't always see eye to eye with Reggie Hammond and many others. James Remar and Sonny Landham make a great duo as the crazed criminals creating a rampaging path through San Francisco.Keep an eye out for many other character actors in small roles including but not limited to Jack's boss Captain Haden (Frank McRae, Lock Up), Jack's girlfriend Elaine (Annette O'Toole, Superman III), Inspector Algren (Jonathan Banks, Breaking Bad), and in other small roles Chris Mulkey (First Blood) as a patrol officer and Denise Crosby (Star Trek: The Next Generation) as Sally, the woman who attacks Reggie with a baseball bat.The movie has non stop foul mouthed, politically incorrect humour which counterbalances the strong violence, but there is no denying that 48 Hrs. is well worth the time. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are certainly are at their likable best.9/10.",48 Hrs.

For the first hour, this is a completely gripping film. At some point after that, Remar and Landham get on a bus and have a car-pushing match against Nolte and Murphy that is just not believable. It damages the rest of the film, as does the thankless and seemingly unconnected part played by the lovely Annette O'Toole as Nolte's girlfriend.
Which is a pity because 48 HOURS could have been a masterpiece of its kind.

Walter Hill,Nick Notle and Eddie Murphy At Their Best.",10,27 March 2013,"Walter Hill's 48 Hrs is an excellent,landmark classic that greatly mixes Action and Comedy. Filled with great direction,excellent performances from Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast and a wonderful score,48 Hrs is Hill,Notle and Murphy at their best.Set in San Francisco,California,48 Hrs tells the story of tough cop Jack Cates(Nick Notle)who wants to bust two cops killers escaped convict Albert Ganz(James Remar)and his associate Billy Bear(Sonny Landham). With nowhere to turn,Jack wants help from Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy,in his film debut),a smooth talking,wisecracking prisoner who used to run with Ganz and Billy Bear. With Jack getting Reggie out for 48 Hrs,Jack and Reggie must team up and try to get Ganz and Billy,that is if they don't kill each other first.48 Hrs is a great film and is the movie that started it all and also set the standard for Action-Comedies that came later on. This film did for Action-Comedy like 2001:A Space Odyseey did for Science Fiction and Halloween did for the Horror/Slasher genre after all Where would all of the Lethal Weapon films,Beverly Hills Cop films,Rush Hour films and others be without 48 Hrs' influence. One of the reasons 48 Hrs is excellent is because the film is a combination of violent 1970s early 80s Action films with edgy Comedy. Unlike most of the Action/Comedies that came which were light in comparison,the Action and tone in 48 Hrs is gritty and sometimes dark and very violent which in my opinion separates 48 Hrs from the other Action/Comedies because the film has a great balance between seriousness and laughter. The film was in between and a transitional period from the gritty Dirty Harry type film of the 70s to the Lethal Weapon/Beverly Hills Cop type films of the 80s and beyond. The Comedy and humor in the film is great because it's sometimes played straight and to the point with memorable dialog and characters which are aggressive and very profane. What I also love about the Comedy and humor is how politically incorrect it is because where most Comedies now play it safe and hold back,48 Hrs' Comedy is edgy,risky and uncompromising. It's the kind of Comedy that would offend most people and studio heads and that's one of the things I love about the film. The now classic Bar scene is a prime example of politically incorrect Comedy. The two main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond are one of cinemas greatest tag team duos and it is a classic pairing that can be seen as a great precursor to Riggs and Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon series except in this film Jack is a Cop and Reggie is the criminal. Like in any entertaining Buddy Action-Comedy,Jack and Reggie at first really hate each other and the back and forth dialog between the two memorable characters is hilarious and truly unforgettable with Jack being tough and gritty and Reggie using his wisecracks and sarcasm and the banter and back and forth between the two doesn't feel forced or fake but real and natural and you as a viewer are fascinated with Jack and Reggie and their natural back forth dialog is what makes the film and the two main characters classic and memorable. While the two hate and dislike each other in the very beginning,Jack and Reggie start to like each other as the film goes on and the two begin to really start to understand their own motivations and reasons for wanting to catch the bad guys and the two main characters are well developed and likable. Co-Writer and Director Walter Hill is a master at dealing with tough male characters and male bonding and 48 Hrs is no exception. The Action and shootouts in the film are amazing,intense and fast-paced like a lot of Walter Hill's films. The Action in the film also gives the film a great balance between Action and Comedy. The ending of the film is Action-packed as well as funny with the characters Jack and Reggie and is a great conclusion.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Nick Nolte is excellent as cop Jack Cates,with Nolte bringing toughness,grit and humor to the role. Eddie Murphy(in one of the great film debuts of all time)is brilliant and hilarious as Reggie Hammond,with Murphy bringing great Comedy to the performance and having great chemistry with Nolte. Annette O'Toole is good and beautiful as Elaine,Jack's girlfriend. Frank McRae is wonderful as Haden,Cates' boss. James Remar and Sonny Landham are great and intense as Albert Ganz and Billy Bear. Brion James does a good job as Ben Kehoe,one of Jack's fellow officers. David Patrick Kelly does a great job as Luther,an associate of Reggie and Ganz. Margot Rose(Casey),Denise Crosby(Sally),Kerry Sherman(Rosalie),Olivia Brown(Candy)and Jonathan Banks(Algren)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is excellent,with Hill bringing an intensity,energy and great atmosphere to the film and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction,Hill.The Score by James Horner is wonderful and intense and adds to the energy and greatness of the film. Great score. The film also includes the classic song The Boys Are Back in Town by The Bus Boys and Brian O'Neal.In Final Word,if you love Action films,Comedy films,Walter Hill,Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy or films in general,I highly suggest you see 48 Hrs,a excellent,landmark classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",48 Hrs.

There is a lot of action in the film and the language is very raw.The success of the film is often pinned on the effective pairing of Nolte and Murphy who both give strong performances as mismatched partners of necessity. This film is often cited as the beginning of the 1980's buddy cop genre which would spawn so many other films.In one of the most archetypal roles of this genre we have Bernie Casey playing the archetypal angry Police Captain, and he's quite good.Composer James Horner contributes a very effective and driving score for an action picture that grabs you from the opening scene You can easily forget how hot a prospect Eddie Murphy was early in his film career before either bad choices or other factors led to his extended career slump. Although he would recover from that slump his choices still seem erratic.On the downside though this film was made 25 years ago it seems today to be at best very male oriented and probably at least somewhat misogynistic. This may be a result of the time in which it was made and certainly reflects much of Director Hill's filmography. But as a result some may find this aspect difficult to ignore. Also reflective of Hill's repertoire is the fairly brutal violence, although this is far from the worst case for either its brutality or its presentation.48 Hours would be followed 8 years later by the oh so imaginatively title sequel Another 48 Hours. This film would re-team both Nolte and Murphy with Director Hill but would be neither as effective nor as successful.",48 Hrs.
85,mhasheider,A seriously edgy and explosive thriller.,8,11 March 2002,"A seriously edgy and explosive thriller about an untidy yet tenacious San Francisco cop, Jack Cates (Nick Nolte), who must take Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), an ultra-cocky convict with him and search around the city for a brutish cop-killer, Ganz (James Remar)and his nearly out-spoken Indian accomplice, Billy Bear (Sonny Landham) and take them down in less than forty-eight hours. What made me enjoy the movie is the trust and respect that the Murphy and Nolte characters begin to show, even there are moments where they want to pound each other's head in. In addition to Nolte and Murphy (who's in his film debut), Remar is pretty good here despite having a limited amount of screen time. The photography of the city by Ric Waite is well, excellent and the skillful direction by Walter Hill can't go unnoticed. ""48 Hrs."" may not look as well-crafted as ""The French Connection"", but Hill sure knows how to make something memorable out of nothing.",48 Hrs.

And on the adventure goes of the two unlikely partners who can barely conceal their disdain for each other but develop a bond and friendship as they come closer to attaining their goal. The chemistry between Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy is among the most memorable in all of film. Nolte's oafish and catankerous character and Murphy's smooth portrayal clash and make up in some of the funniest scenes and lines in all of filmdom. There's a rawness and awkwardness in some of the dialogues and scenes that give the film a ring of authenticity. One doesn't see these in movies anymore and cinema is all the poorer for it. The nostalgia factor is paramount as one views the fashion and mores bringing back memories of another time. One of the best Cop / Buddy films made, this is one that stays for good.",48 Hrs.

89,monkeysgalore,A True Classic,10,21 November 2018,"Finally got around to watching this film recently, and man, did I love it. One of the most inventive and interesting movies ever, especially for its time, and also one of the first buddy cop movies ever, as well as one of the best.You already know the plot, as many other reviewers have outlined it, so I won't get into that here. What I will say is that it is a truly unique and original story, at least, it was in 1982. Combine a dynamite script with two excellent leads and you have one of the most fun rides in cinema ever. The script is really great, and I was especially excited to see that Roger Spottiswoode wrote it, as I'm a fan of several of his other films, such as; ""Shoot to Kill"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and ""The 6th Day"".As far as action goes, this one has more than enough, and is brimming with gritty, brutal action. From the opening prison escape scene, to the hotel shootout, to the interrogation with Luther, to the redneck bar scene, to the legendary alley fight scene, to the bus chase, to the final, climactic battle in the apartment building, this truly is a skillfully crafted, highly entertaining action movie.The comedy is really great too, and while this is more action/thriller, there is some comedy, but the majority of the humor comes from Eddie Murphy who really makes the movie. ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is definitely more comedy, while this one is more action, but in both, Murphy is at the top of his quick-witted, hilarious, and likable game. Nolte is also great as the tough, burnt-out, Dirty Harry-esque cop, and his chemistry with Murphy is excellent. Nolte really should've done some more action films aside from ""Another 48 HRS"" and ""Extreme Prejudice"", as he really has the chops to star in more action roles.This is an incredibly gritty, occasionally dark, movie, and the tone of the film is pretty somber, even when Eddie Murphy is shooting his mouth off. Cops are not particularly liked, African-Americans are treated like second-class citizens and often shunned, racial slurs are often present, there are skin-color-segregated bars, and no one really likes each other. All the guys want is sex, and all the women want is a faithful partner who they can love and trust. Everyone has problems or is flawed in some way, and that's pretty much what the movie is; two very different, flawed men who must work together and put aside their differences, and who both grow to appreciate each other by the end.Everyone was well-cast and delivers great performances, and Nolte and Murphy really carry the movie. Nolte is the perfect hard-edged, tough cop, and Murphy is the perfect smooth, quick-witted convict. The two play off of each other very well, and that's where the charm of the movie lies, and what set it apart from being just another cop action thriller.Aside from ""Freebie and the Bean"", ""48 HRS"" has the honor of jumpstarting the buddy cop genre, which would go on to spawn many copycats and other equally successful films in the 80s and 90s, and it would also catapult Eddie Murphy to stardom, allowing him to make the wildly successful and entertaining ""Beverly Hills Cop"". I highly recommend it, especially if you're a big buddy/buddy cop movie fan, or a fan of the actors.If you want a classic film that really develops its intriguing characters and has great action and big laughs, than this movie is for you. However, this is a pretty rough movie, and definitely a hard R, and if you're willing to tolerate graphic language and skip through some equally graphic nudity, than ok, but just know that that's what you're getting into if you can't stomach that kind of stuff.",48 Hrs.
90,kingofdanerds,I like this more than Beverly Hills Cop (and I love that film),10,24 February 2021,"Ever wondered how Eddie Murphy started his film career? Well that film is 48 Hrs. 48 Hrs. was released in 1982 and was directed by Walter Hill who has directed several films like The Warriors and produced several films like Aliens and Alien 3. As said, this is Eddie Murphy's first film role and he stars alongside Nick Nolte (Tropic Thunder). The film co stars Annette O'Toole (It miniseries and Smallville), James Remar (Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Hellraiser: Inferno) and Sonny Landham (Predator). 48 Hrs. is often credited with creating the buddy cop genre and paving the way for films like the Lethal Weapon series. The film was a commercial and critical success and is considered to be the best film of 1982 that is if you forget First Blood and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The film would later recieve a sequel in 1990 called, Another 48 Hrs.Jack is your typical do-it-my-way type of cop. After an escaped convict along with an accomplice shoot and kill a few officers, it is up to Jack to catch both killers. But, he will need help from a prisoner who robbed a bank. They have 48 hours to find the two killers. Both Jack and Reggie (the prisoner and played by Murphy) are complete opposites, so will they be able to find the killers in 48 Hrs.48 Hrs. is a film that I have been dying to see for quite some time and I finally have been able to watch it on DVD. 48 Hrs. did create the buddy cop genre. So a lot of the typical tropes and what not that I have seen already are in this film and that is because, it help create those tropes. None of the annoying tropes either, that is a product of the bad buddy cop films. 48 Hrs. is an action, comedy, and even a thriller. Eddie Murphy would later go on and star in Beverly Hills Cop which is a fine film but right when that movie starts, it comes out as a comedy. 48 Hrs. is not that way and that is what I admire a lot out of this film because the comedy is rather natural and not forced. The action is fairly fun too. Do remember that this is 1982, years before films like Rambo: First Blood Part II, Robocop, and Die Hard. The gunfights are fun to watch and there are a few other scenes filled with action that are fun to watch as well. The comedy itself is really good too. Again, it is not forced and feels natural. All of the comedic bits are really funny and that is due in large part thanks to the two leads whose characters really have great chemistry together despite not really liking each other at first. I really enjoyed the film most when Murphy and Nolte were on screen together and this duo is a duo I would like to see more in film. There is a sequel titled, Another 48 Hrs. and while I have not watched it at the time of this review, I have heard that it is not that good or at least not as good as the original. The acting is really good with Eddie Murphy doing a fantastic job here. Apparantly his performance was good enough to recieve a Golden Globe nomination for his role and he should have won because there are some great acting moments for Murphy where he is not comedic but really serious. The acting overall is really good all around. The villains are not the strongest but I can look past that because, hell, they kill cops and are very intimidating as well and also well acted. Their motives are mostly about money but they are memorable enough that I won't detract anything from this film in my final score. Supporting characters somewhat come and go and let's be honest, the main focus of the film is Murphy and Nolte. The film score was done by James Horner who I know best for his work on the Star Trek films. I really like the music here and I think it fits well with the whole tone and vibe of the whole film. Is it his best? No, but still pretty good.48 Hrs. is a very fun film that will satisfy any fans of the action comedy genre. I highly recommend this film for anyone interested.",48 Hrs.
91,Gideon24,A dazzling film debut for a future superstar,8,6 March 2015,"48 HRS was one of the best action/adventure/buddy cop movies ever made that introduced a brand new movie star to the world named Eddie Murphy.The film stars Nick Nolte as Jack Cates, a world weary cop, who finds himself in a bind when a fellow officer is killed with his gun by a slimy criminal who broke out of jail in order to get his hands on a booty that is in the trunk of the car of a former running partner named Reggie Hammond, who is now in jail. Cates realizes the only way to get this guy is by enlisting the aid of Hammond, who he gets a 48-hour pass out of jail in order to nab the bad guy.Eddie Murphy deservedly became a movie star with his star-making turn as Reggie Hammond, but Nolte's Cates is an equally effective characterization, a veteran cop who might be slightly over the hill but in complete denial about it. Nolte effortlessly nails the world- weariness of his character without ever letting Murphy blow him off the screen. James Remar also had one of his best roles as Ganz, the bad guy that Cates and Hammond are after. The scene where Murphy takes command of a redneck bar is just outstanding.Nolte and Murphy were reunited for a sequel, but like I always say, stick to the original.",48 Hrs.
92,LuboLarsson,Superb,8,27 June 2004,"Before I decided to comment on this film I clicked on Eddie's name to see what films he had coming up, Daddy Day Camp, thats right a sequel to Daddy Day Care. Is there really anyone who wants to see that? Compare Daddy Day Care, Dr Dolittle or god help us Haunted Mansion to 48 hrs, hmmmm slightly different aren't they. What has happened to Eddie Murphy, OK fair enough do the odd kiddie film but please, please do some adult comedy/action thrillers too, because isn't that what made him a superstar in the first place? 48 hrs was Eddie's first film and he is absolutely brilliant in it. He is helped by the excellent Nick Nolte to be fair. Eddie is in prison and cop Nolte needs his help to catch a very mean criminal, so he gets him out of jail for 48 hrs to team up with him, and they hate each other! they hate each other a lot! what follows is some of the best comedy and action seen in any film in the 80's or anyother decade for that matter. Directed by Walter Hill who has made some cracking films like The Wanderers and Southern Comfort, this film never lets up its terrific entertainment. Several years later they made a carbon copy follow up called Another 48 hrs but it was very disappointing, it couldn't match the original but then again what could? Even Lethal Weapon isn't quite in the same class as 48 hrs ***8/10***",48 Hrs.

97,filmbuff1970,Great Movie,10,2 June 2004,This is a great buddy buddy movie. Eddie Murphy is a real movie star in his first movie. He is a million miles away from the family oriented movies he makes now. Which is a shame because his early performances had a down to earth quality that changed when he became a superstar. The movie is fast paced and has a great score.  Nick Nolte is also terrific in this and the movie is miles better than the awful summer blockbusters i have sat through recently. I wish Murphy would come back to this type of movie. A great action movie with enough genuine laughs and great performances.

Nolte was good in this movie too, playing an alchoholic chain smoking cop with a girlfreind who cant stand his job.  But it was Murphy who stole the show as the slick convict who wanted both revenge against the bad guy's and some to go on a ""pussy hunt"".  The pairing of Nolte and Murphy was a great idea.

100,DJ_Shilo,Cops and convicts,9,23 September 2018,"Once in a blue moon, a comedic actor comes along worth the salt to be funny. In this case, Nick Nolte is hilarious but he is joined by newcomer, Eddie Murphy who goes beyond to prove himself and is a laugh riot in ""48 Hrs."" It's about a hardnosed, alcoholic, San Francisco cop, Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) who has a bad attitude and does not like to play by the rules. After two fellow police officers are blown away by an escaped psychotic robber, Albert Ganz (James Remar) and his partner Billy Bear (Sonny Landham), Jack swears revenge. He soon discovers that Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), who used to be part of the gang with Ganz, is in prison and after some easy negotiations, springs Reggie for 48 Hrs. to help him track down the killers. The two become the unlikeliest of partners as they try to bring Ganz down before the 48 Hrs. are up.Everyone loves a burnout cop with a foul mouth and a need to do things his way. Nick Nolte takes the cake for this. His character is hungover, constantly drinking and foul-mouthed. When we first meet him he gets up from his girlfriend's bed, throws his clothes on and pours whiskey into his coffee. Nice way to start the day off. After, he gets into his sky blue convertible and rips up the road. This newcomer Eddie Murphy is quite funny as Reggie. He is equally foul-mouthed and when we first see him he is in a prison cell, he is singing ""Roxanne"" by ""The Police."" After the first time, we see these two characters met, you can feel the laughs bubbling to the surface and we know it's going to be funny for there on.They end up cruising around in the busted sky blue Cadillac attempting to follow leads as to where Ganz might be hiding. One scenario leads to another laugh until Cates discovers Reggie is hiding some information to which they get into a humorous fight where they end up in the garbage. Not before Cates has another slug of whiskey from his flask. From here the two develop a grudging respect for each other. The plot of the film is very thin and not much to go on Cop chases killers, not much else. What makes it special is Reggie and Jack. They are funny and present a chemistry that makes you want to see what will happen next.I must mention this sequence because it will be remembered for a long time. In the second act, Reggie enters into a bar to get some answers. The problem is that the bar is a redneck bar, the kind where people drink like pigs out of longneck bottles. Reggie is constantly jiving to Cates that he can handle a situation so he is given the chance to prove himself useful by impersonating Jack as a police officer. He walks up to the bar, asks a question and throws his glass at the wall. He intimidates everyone and surprisingly gets his information. This sequence is rather funny because there is an ethnic overtone in the air as the sequence plays through.For a comedy with the usual foul language, the film is rather offensive in the sense that Jack likes to pick on Reggie because he is black. Just about every name you can think of, Jack throws at him in an attempt to make the audience laugh. Jack is a cynical burnout so this kind of attitude works for him because Reggie always manages to fire back at him for being an immature hot dogger of a cop. The other shock was how violent it is for a comedy. The usual gunplay violence is here but it's rather graphic and disturbing. James Remar as Albert Ganz adds a violent intensity to the picture because he is a mean-spirited cop killer. He is truly evil in the sense that he would shoot anyone in the face for getting in his way, not just cops. I really liked the film a lot more than I expected. It's funny and quirky but it's very routine for an action comedy. It's also quite dark and more of a white-knuckle thrill ride. The climax is to be expected and it shouldn't come as a surprise as to how it ends but it works and is good fun.",48 Hrs.

The film has a nice pace to it as well.The chemistry between Nolte and Murphy takes a little while to get going, but I appreciate that it just takes a while for these characters to establish a relationship, if you want to call it that.If you want a good popcorn movie with action, laughs, and real horrible bad guys, then sit back and enjoy.",48 Hrs.

Walter Hill's style set up a structure a lot of films would borrow from for a long time.  It's also was the first time the ""buddy"" system was applied in such a way.  It had been seen before, but not with characters like this. Not with the same banter and chemistry by Nolte and Murphy.  They are a great team, which is something a lot of recent buddie cop films have been missing.  Their performances together was the foundation for a lot of other buddie cop films, including anothe black & white pair, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon.  The movie provides some good action scenes, but at the time they could only do so much.  It's better viewed with the frame of mind that this has a comedy foreground and action background.  There are some weak spots, like with any action film.  Some scenes drag a bit.  The thing with Nolte's girlfriend is underdeveloped and thus it's inclusion in the film at all is a waste of time.  And the film lacks a great villain. Hey, I love James Remar as much as the next guy, but the entire second act goes without an appearnce by the main baddie.  Overall, it has flaws.  But the Nolte/Murphy combo combined with Walter Hill's directing makes this a worthwhile venture.7/10* * */****",48 Hrs.
105,mhoney-1,Alternately hilarious (of course) and thrilling,10,28 August 2003,"Nick Nolte is well-cast as the average tough, somewhat maverick cop who gets involved in a case involving an escaped convict and his partner and their psychopathic rampage through San Francisco. He's forced to enlist the help of fast-talking incarcerated con man Eddie Murphy, who has dealt with one of the killers in past. Murphy insists he be let out for 48 hours in order to secure a stash of money he has that the killer wants. Nolte and Murphy are a mismatched pair, Murphy being the sly young criminal, Nolte being a tough, somewhat ignorant cop who tires easily of his partner's fast mouth and wayward way of giving information, and constant attempts at getting a gun.There's one good scene where Murphy walks into a redneck cowboy joint with a bet about what it takes to be taken seriously as a cop, and trades places with Nolte as a detective trying to get information on where one of the guys is. Later on, Nolte and Murphy get into a fight because Murphy won't say what he knows the escaped killer is after.Walter Hill creates one of the best cop movies ever, and a perfect movie to act as Murphy's first real vehicle for his comedy style. However, this is not comedy like, say, ""Trading Places."" This movie is more the comedy style of the first ""Lethal Weapon"" movie. Alternately serious and funny.",48 Hrs.

Brilliantly acted, very good scenes, the scene in redneck bar and the scene where the boss has a rant after the infamous bus losing incident are the best. The boss is excellent. The way he delivers his lines with such anger, and the lines themselves are very hard. ""YOU GO F*** YOURSELF CONVICT!!!"" is my favourite of the whole film. The look on Eddie's face is priceless. Just proves how class an actor he is, if proof be necessary. Redneck bar scene is equally good. The music the band are playing fits the scene beautifully.

Too bad, that also accounts for 48 hours - a quarter century old, give me a break! I really don't get what people see in this film. Never found it funny, anywhere - only very tiring. Nolte couldn't amuse me, he merely grumbled a lot but never hilariously. Murphy sure did much better in his Beverly Hills Cop series. Similar was the rudeness, regrettably. I honestly felt uneasy seeing the movie together with my 15 year old daughter. Besides that, the film is too old to appeal to the modern viewer.

I recently watched it after many years and realized that although funny with some witty banter it had a lot of scenes that were contrived to make the action continuous. It is definately a classic comedy drama pairing of a young Eddie Murphy as a convict with a past who is used by a tough San Francisco street cop to track down a couple of prison escapees who have ties to Murphy.

It is the third time I watched it (I have only done a third view with about 20 flicks) and it keeps entertaining from start to finish. These guys were born to make this film together. The Hill Street Blues style cop with the Beverly Hills style cop combination really works when they play it. Nolte and Murphy are pure class.Even the location suits the film. You got to love San Francisco!! In fact the only other cop flick that entertained me this much is the excellent French film 36 Quai Des Orfevres with Auteuil and Depardieu.Great story, brilliant acting, old style no BS action scenes!!

111,jethrotroll-30807,Average script carried by Nolte and Murphy,8,2 June 2015,"If one was looking for a good example of how great acting can carry a so-so script, 48 hrs would be a good choice.Nick Nolte is perfectly cast as 'Jack Cates', a rumpled, gruff cop on the hunt for an escaped killer. He elicits the help of a smooth talking, jailed convict who is connected to the killer, 'Reggie Hammond', who again is perfectly played by Eddie Murphy. Over the next 48 hours, the two polar opposites not only fight their way to the killer, but fight each other as well, making for some very memorable scenes. Yet, by the end of the movie, the two learn to respect each other and become friends.While the script isn't all that special, the movie is dominated by the performances of Nolte and Murhpy. The chemistry between the two is off the charts, and it's a pleasure watching these two banter back and forth between each other scene after scene.48 Hrs is edgy, quickly paced and refreshingly politically incorrect. But most of all, it's fun. The plot of the movie may have Nolte and Murphy chasing Ganz, the escaped killer (played well by James Remar) and his accomplice, the real show is Nolte and Murphy. They alone are worth the price of admission and make this a must see comedy/thriller.",48 Hrs.
112,YouelleArge99,"Entertaining, but the plot is paper thin",4,22 May 2020,"The cast is game as usual, but they're let down by an uninspired script that too often throws out forced humor, and direction that is extremely slow. An action-packed finale is definitely the film's highpoint, but it still falls short in comparison.As far as entertainment goes, this is good. But if you are the sort of person who enjoys a film with a well thought out and coherent plot then this may come as a disappointment. I gave it 4/10 purely for its entertainment value.",48 Hrs.
113,Gotensive,Very Underrated,8,27 October 2007,"This movie is really very simple. It's about a hard-nosed go by the book cop named Jack Cates who teams up with a sarcastic and slick convict named Reggie Hammond. The formula is basically your typical buddy cop film, but what makes this movie so great is the chemistry between Nolte and Murphy. Both provide us with tons of laughs as they race to catch a vicious killer. This movie also has some great action sequences, and even a little bit of drama. And of-course one cannot forget the classic scene where Murphy takes over the Redneck bar posing as a cop. I don't think anyone has ever had such a successful debut on the big screen as Eddie Murphy did in 48 HRS. Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the Eddie Murphy from the 1980's. You know, the one who did movies such as 48 HRS., Beverly Hills Cop, and Coming to America instead of garbage like Daddy Day Care and Dr. Dolittle?",48 Hrs.

Officer: Jack Cates looking for Ganz and Billy Bear who killed a couple of police officers and are after hidden money  stolen from drug dealers a couple years earlier.Which Jack Cates needs Murphy's character convict Reggie Hammond to help him. Whose money Ganz and Billy are after.Eddie murphy is as funny as ever with his entry 30 minutes into the movie. singing""roxanne""-by Sting and the Police from his cell. They made a good team together.Trend of Buddy/Buddy flicks started after this.Funniest scene in the movie was bar scene where Murphy gets loose going off on rednecks.10 out of 10 .

115,le-misanthrop,Mix black and white and what you get is ... the dullest gray!,5,9 November 2005,"If you are into harsh language, unmotivated violence and unconvincing plot lines, you might just be the perfect audience for Walter Hill's unlikely buddy movie ""48 hours"". Maybe I'm too pedantic or too much driven by logic, but I don't get the point of this film. Cop Nick Nolte desperately needs the convict Eddie Murphy's assistance to detain a sadistic gangster. Harry Callahan never would've needed help by a brazen, brash and hugely overrated ex-regular of ""Saturday Night Live"". This whole film is a contrived vehicle to promote Murphy's career that lacks the slightest bit of internal logic, coherence and style. And unfortunately it inspired many follow-up movies like ""Last Boy Scout"" et al. that turned out to be even worse.",48 Hrs.
116,reisnersteven,Before my time but wow,9,9 September 2016,"Now i will start this by saying I am only twenty three years old, therefore I was not even born at the time such classics like this were released. However I have watched every action movie to ever come out, despite the big budget blockbusters nowadays, that I still enjoy, movies like this will always stand the test of time. For these films weren't classics because of a budget, but for the characters. Anybody whoever in any way studied the art of writing knows that character is the most important part to any story ever told. The new action movies May have Better shootouts, but if you can appreciate not just that, but character and writing then this is a great film, if you don't agree then go to hell cuz you still don't know what a great action movie is. Shame on you if you can't appreciate action cinema at its finest. Seriously if you call yourself an action fan but hate this movie and others like it then just shoot yourself, because you will never appreciate true cinema",48 Hrs.
117,beverlyhillscopseries,A heck of a debut from Eddie Murphy,9,26 June 2010,"It's funny how my favorite entertainer of all time is Eddie Murphy and he made his theatrical debut the year I was born, 1982 with 48 Hours. I can just imagine what folks thought when they saw this film originally 28 years ago.The 1980s represents in my opinion one of the better decades for entertainment EVER! And 48 Hours has a lot to do with that statement. I have seen this movie a million times and its kind of bittersweet, that Murphy ended up becoming one of the biggest movie stars ever while the very talented Nick Nolte was a criminally underrated actor for much of his career.This represented not only the movie debut of Murphy but also one of the finest hours of Nolte and head villain James Remar's (Albert Ganz) career. Remar is also an underrated actor who I have enjoyed in many shows and movies; but he was really a scumbag in this film beating on women, killing people for nothing, etc.This film was one of Walter Hill's better films and it was also a very, very well cast film. This movie ranks in my Top 5 of best Eddie Murphy films. For all of you who grew up in the 1980s be VERY thankful, because they don't make stuff anymore like they did back then.",48 Hrs.
118,MightyMountain,If There Ever Were,10,10 September 2013,"A near perfect meld of comedy, action and drama, 48 Hrs. tops my list. The interplay between Nolte and Murphy is fantastic. James Remar is excellent...many others, too! Name any that exist in multiple genres so well... please...that way I'll know which movies to add to my ""watch"" list. What are the best lines...there are so many: Reggie: ""I gotta tell you he's having a ball with this car door, Luther...You'd better think of somethin' to tell him."" Reggie: ""But remember this, cowboy, there's a new sheriff in town, and his name is Reggie Hammond. Y'all be oool."" Reggie: ""Jack, tell me a story."" Jack: ""#@%! You!"" Reggie: ""OOoohh, that's one of my favorites!""",48 Hrs.
119,Macca-14,Armani here we come,8,23 November 1999,"Rarely, if ever has anybody watched a film because of a suit.I have to admit that my friends' recommendation to see this ""cool, funny black guy in an Armani suit"" was too good to miss to an impressionable 16 year old, having just bought my first item of Armani apparel.The film, as was the suit, and the cool, funny  black guy, were not a disappointment.Murphy was an instant hit in his big screen debut, playing a wise cracking convict used by Cates(Nick Nolte) to track down a cop murdering villain.The humour scenes, set up for Murphy's talents do not disappoint as our unlikely hero shows a professional law-man how to go under cover.",48 Hrs.
120,richieburke30,48 Hrs Dating Badly,6,2 December 2013,"I remember watching this movie as a child & loving the cursing & action but after watching it again 25 years later, It isn't anything more than a Bad Cop Show. Eddie Murphy is the only thing that kept me interested. Nick Nolte just grumbles throughout the movie, that is the character he is portraying but watching it now is cringe worthy. The Villain has nothing going for him in this movie, He isn't Scary or in anyway Menacing.Check Johnathan Banks aka Mike Ehrmantraut from ""Breaking Bad"" landing a Small Role at the Start & I also think I seen Terry Crews in The Busboy Band. Overall It's an O.k Watch for Nostalgia but that's it.I will Check out Another 48 Hrs just to see was there any improvement.",48 Hrs.
121,Mr. Good,Good Waste of Time; Not Money.,6,27 December 1998,"48 HRS. is truly one of the original cop movies.  Many of the elements of this film would soon be copied and duplicated over time.  Nolte plays his typical ""tough guy"", while Eddie Murphy is, well, Eddie Murphy.  If you are looking for great special effects and big explosions, you WILL NOT find it here!  What you will find is a simple plot, solid character acting, and good gunshot wounds.  Final thought: Good waste of time; not money.",48 Hrs.
122,martystu,Unbelievable and Unlikeable.,3,27 May 2019,"That's what the characters are in this film. The acting is quite good but the script they were given to enact was very poorly written. The dialogue is terrible, as characters say things that makes no sense. The characters also frequently do things they wouldn't do, and what's even worse is that their reactions to what's going on around them doesn't make much sense either. There are several scenes where law enforcement officers gets shot and the surviving officers that witnessed them get gunned down behave as if no one died. They don't check up on their colleagues, they don't appeared shocked or worried even. And when they call for back up they don't even mention that one of, or sometimes even several, of their colleagues have been murdered. That's just unforgiveable in my book, sloppy beyond belief.The film is also not helped by how unlikeable it's main protagonist is. Does anyone want to be like Jack Cates? I hope not. He's neither charming, attractive, clever or virtous. He's just a big, rude, violent brute and as such much better suited for a role as a henchman than a protagonist. He's not even particularly good at being a brute to be honest as he can't even beat up the co-protagonist Reggie Hammond, despite being a much bigger man.The film has some moments of unintended comedy, but I find myself laughing at it instead of with it. Many will point out the racially charged undertones in the film, overtones really to be honest as it's not the least bit subtle, and they're very difficult to ignore. 48 Hrs is in many ways a time capsule to a different era where no one was particularly worried about the prospect of offending others. The film's main protagonist, Jack Cates, is the living embodiment of insensitivity and perhaps this very feature is the only interesting aspect of this movie. To a current day audience this film provides shock value as it's everything but what plagues so many films of today; politically correct. That only carries it so far however as it's still a poorly written story with more faults than I have the fortitude to list.I therefore would not recommend this film to anyone.3/10",48 Hrs.
123,faceless_unknown,Refreshing,10,6 July 2003,"The two main characters in this movie, reggie hammond and jack cates, are caricatures of the stereotypes present in modern/industrial society. When the movie began I thought I would not like it because the characters were so stereotypical, but director Walter Hill did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life as real people. This movie is not interested in being politically correct. In the beginning Murphy is a pussy hunting, lazy convict and Nolte is a cornbred, cracker police officer. By the end of the movie we see that the two characters have become good friends and are not so different(spoiler: Nolte is a pretty dirty cop that fakes signatures, beats prisoners and drinks).The direction is good and the story is very simple. The great action sequences and the chemistry between nolte and murphy make this a classic.
Spoilers My favorite parts were when Nolte stuck up for Murphy despite the criticisms and slurs the police captain was directing at Murphy and the part when Murphy and Nolte were separated and Murphy could have bolted and left Nolte to get in trouble but he called the station and gave nolte a hint to where he was located. I liked the part when Nolte gave Murphy time to get laid.9/10",48 Hrs.
124,riskybones5,stupid,1,4 July 2015,"I remember seeing this when it first came out, and I thought it was a stupid plot-Cop needs help from convict to catch a cop killer- Cop drives prisoner around looking for bad guys--- well to this day in the real world,that has not happened-- if it did in the past - the prisoner was most likely restrained with hand cuffs,and guarded by 10 other cops-- Hollywood and reality just don't mix- the other things is how easy it was for Nick Nolte to get him out of prison, and how when he went into the jail cell un-escorted. everything from a county lock-up to a state prison don't allow cops to just go in there. very stupid movie",48 Hrs.
125,mellan_love,"Buddy Movie - maybe first, but not the best",5,15 July 2005,"I first saw this movie a couple of days ago on TV. I'd heard a lot about it and most people seemed to like it, so I thought it was worth a shot. But I must say I was disappointed. It was nothing like what I had anticipated.The plot was a bit confusing and the fist-fights looked real stupid (perhaps because the movie's pretty old by now...). Especially the one between Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, although that was one of the funniest parts of the movie.Murphy and Nolte created the ""Buddy-genre"" with this flick, but most of the film they're just spending time insulting each other (especially Nolte) as much as possible. Too much rough macho-talk, in my opinion. But Murphy was great in his break-through role as smooth, sweet-talking convict Reggie Hammond. This was the time when Murphy was still actually funny. And I must admit that Nick Nolte did a pretty good job playing the grumpy, stubborned police-officer Jack Cates.Cates and Hammond are teamed up to catch an old business pal of Hammond's, who happens to have escaped from prison with the help of an Indian gangster called Billy Bear. He also has got the old of Cates' gun and is using it to shoot cops with.I really thought this movie would be a lot more entertaining, and I also anticipated more chemistry between the two lead actors. Sometimes they came out alright together - after about half of the movie or so - but it was mostly Murphy who got the punch-lines. Nolte seemed like he was trying a little too hard to be a tough guy.I don't know. Maybe my biggest problem is that I saw this movie AFTER I'd seen the Lethal Weapon series. I'd like to say that Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte CREATED this film genre, but it was Mel Gibson and Danny Glover who DEFINED it. Sorry, but that's the way it is.I'm not saying this movie is bad, but if you liked it and would like to see a REALLY good buddy movie, I recommend Lethal Weapon. That's where you'll find the real Magic.",48 Hrs.
126,Kensirhan,Sound! Where's The Sound?,10,20 January 2005,"This is one of my favorite movies, even 23 years later it still holds up nicely - many current and recent offerings of the kind could learn from it. It does have the one traffic-based continuity goof that makes me laugh every time, and I wish I could find that crazy little cartoon Space Kid someplace. But what also makes this film so excellent is its atmospheric music, especially the hard-driving opening theme and its steel drum-flavored variations - particularly when Our Heroes follow Luther to the subway station (whence the traffic goof is revealed) - yet unlike the tiresome sequel, there ain't no soundtrack to this! Like Harold Faltermeyer's incidental music in Beverly Hills Cop what wasn't included on that movie's soundtrack, I feel cheated of Good Listening independent of the action here - and I loved Brand New Shoes or whatever that first performed song was called instead of that overrated yawner The Boys Are Back In Town. The artistes released a *cover* CD which really doesn't cover it. I just now found out about a Horner bootleg from 7 years ago!!! that has both the title track and the Following Luther theme, although in one case a reviewer found its sound quality to be less than perfect. But without any Official commercial releases, what other choices are there? Paramount really dropped the ball on this one. Maybe one day they'll pick it back up.",48 Hrs.
