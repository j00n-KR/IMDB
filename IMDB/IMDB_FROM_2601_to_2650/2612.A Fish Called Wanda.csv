0,TheLittleSongbird,A comedy classic,10,8 January 2011,"What can I say about A Fish Called Wanda that hasn't been said already. Not a lot seemingly, everything has been said so well about how good this film is. A Fish Called Wanda epitomises the term comedy classic in every way. It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. John Cleese is sensational in one of his best roles, while Kevin Kline is just as skilled at delivering the comedy and Jamie Lee Curtis is just a treasure. Overall, if you want a fast-paced, hilarious and original film look no further than this jewel. 10/10 Bethany Cox",A Fish Called Wanda
1,Leofwine_draca,Wonderful farce,10,8 February 2014,"It's hard for me to choose my favourite comedy starring John Cleese, as it's a toss-up between this wonderful farce and the lower-budgeted CLOCKWISE. Both are equally good, I think. A FISH CALLED WANDA is just a superb piece of comedy film-making, a film which always makes me wonder why the follow-up (FIERCE CREATURES) was so horrible and why Cleese never really made it in Hollywood.The madcap plot throws plenty of disparate elements into the mix, involving diamond heists, lawyers, and a loveless marriage, but it's the characters who really make this one shine. Cleese and Curtis hold it all together as the relatively straight protagonists, but it's in the support where things get really interesting. Kevin Kline's Oscar-winning turn as the psychotic Otto is absolutely hilarious, with never a dull moment, and really the lynchpin that makes the whole movie work.Then there's the stammering Michael Palin, almost as good, as the animal-loving and bumbling criminal who soon finds himself completely out of his depth. His torture sequence is the stuff of genius and the presence of both Palin and Cleeve give this whole movie a MONTY PYTHON feel (even though it has nothing to do with MONTY PYTHON other than the presence of the two stars). An inspired sense of lunacy and energy combine to make A FISH CALLED WANDA an all-out classic.",A Fish Called Wanda
2,SnoopyStyle,Wackiest Craziest Characters,8,10 November 2013,"Four crazy characters team up to steal diamonds, and then try to doublecross each other. Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson) is the elder. Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a vixen who play all the men like a fiddle. Otto (Kevin Kline) is blindly in love with Wanda and easily goes violently crazy. Ken Pile (Michael Palin) is the stuttering animal lover. When the double-crossing begins, Georges' attorney Archie Leach (John Cleese) is dragged into the chaos.The wacky craziness is punctuated by Michael Palin and Kevin Kline. They've created two of the craziest most memorable characters. Who can truly forget Kevin Kline shoving that fish back in his mouth? It helps that Jamie Lee Curtis is both beautiful and ballsy. It serves her well in this movie.",A Fish Called Wanda
3,Hitchcoc,Don't Call Me Stupid!,9,8 January 2010,"When a man can recover from being run over by a steamroller, we know we aren't in the world's most serious movie. Still, the wit and byplay that goes on in this gem is wonderful. It has a great cast: John Cleese, MIchael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis, and, especially, Kevin Kline (I though he was Calvin Klein when I first heard about him). He has been wonderful in just about everything, but his ticky, off the wall character in this film is worth the price of admission. The plot is like one of those sixties heist films, but this is a visual joy. As animal rights advocate Palin sets out to kill several dogs owned by an old lady who is the only witness to a jewel heist (to cause her to have a heart attack), we are treated to some of the greatest sight gags ever. Also, Kline's jealous rages and impromptu appearances in the most inappropriate places, are marvelous. It was really fun to see a true comedy which doesn't demand the lowest common denominator from us. Great movie.",A Fish Called Wanda
4,boblipton,A Tasty Bit Of Tastelessness,10,13 September 2021,"What makes this old friend so very funny? There are lots of great setpiece sequences, like Michael Palin running over Kevin Kline in slow motion. It's the energy that Kline gives to his Oscar-winning role, the way Jamie Lee Curtis double crosses everyone, Michael Palin's stammer, Tom Georgeson's malign mastermind, the clockwork jewel robbery..... but mostly its the mean-spirited selfishness that suffuses every moment of it. It's pretty much unique for British comedy, which always seems to have a soft spot some place for the little fellow. Even the Boultings, at their most vicious, have that normative core , a sense of right and wrong, to grimace dourly at the actions of their petty tyrants.This movie, however, makes no such claim. In fact, Cleese's monologue about the stifling, lifeless way in which the British are terrified of saying the wrong thing the terror of asking about the spouse and being told she left that morning... it's not a comedy of embarrassment. It's a comedy of shamelessness, and pretty much unique. And anyone who talks about 'poor taste' doesn't get it. It's meant to be tasteless.",A Fish Called Wanda
5,mark.waltz,Bad manners have never been so hysterical.,9,21 January 2021,"Don't call Kevin Kline stupid. Just because he thinks that Lincoln's Gettysburg address is where he lived doesn't mean that he's stupid. While he's just your everyday common con-man doesn't mean that he doesn't know about Aristotle's Belgian past or the ins and outs of the secret service. So when Jamie Lee Curtis tells him that he's so stupid that he gives a bad name to stupid people, it's a sense of irony, and that's just one of many laughs at his expense.Back when this came out, I thought it was amusing but not hysterical, but as I got more into the Monty Python style of humor, I began to realize the genius behind this. Kline deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actor, and he gives an acrobatic performance that has to be seen to be believed. His energy is so strong that you fear he might drop from exhaustion at any minute.As the shady lover of Ms. Curtis, he is introduced to her roommate Michael Palin as her brother. It's hard to believe that Curtis and the bumbling Palin would be involved, but while it's not confirmed, there's certainly something up. The opening of the film shows them involved in a major diamond heist, and one of the gang (Tom Georgeson) is arrested. The diamonds disappear so Kline pretends to have a crush on Palin and later kidnaps him to locate them.Curtis manages to meet his defender (John Cleese, also delightful!) and sets out to seduce him, aiding him in getting away from his sophisticated and beautiful wife Maria Aitken who is hysterically nasty to him. Meanwhile, Palin goes out of his way to knock off the one witness to them leaving the scene of the crime, a little old lady with three nasty dogs, dealt with in a very hysterical but tasteless manner.Over 30 years later from having originally seen this, it's more than just the few select moments I remembered that end up being hysterical. Pretty much every part of this film is laugh out loud funny, and Aitken gets some great lines that makes her quite memorable, reminding me of a combination of a young Maggie Smith and Sarah Douglas. these are definitely people who would not be on anybody's social register, but to spend 2 hours with them is a guaranteed good time. One of the great comedies of the past 40 years that in another 40 will be considered an all-time classic.",A Fish Called Wanda
6,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Comedies of the 80's,8,24 August 2003,"The sophisticated English  Georges (Tom Georgeson), the stuttering  English and owner of an aquarium where the fishes have names Ken (Michael Palin), the ex-CIA killer and very dumb American Otto (Kevin Kline) and the sexy American Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) executes a perfect heist of a fortune in diamonds in London. After the robbery, a double-crossing game among them will cause the funniest situation the viewer can imagine. Archie Leach (John Cleese), the stereotype of an Englishman, is hilarious as a successful attorney and failure with his wife and daughter. Jamie Lee Curtis is not a beautiful woman, but she is certainly one of the most sexy star in the cinema. In this movie, she is perfect as a smart and amoral woman. Kevin Kline as the stupid Otto is very funny. The guy is so stupid that, for example, he does not get used to the British way of driving and causes accidents when he drives a car. This is one of the best comedies of the 80's and I myself have watched this movie at least five times (now on DVD). Recommended for those viewers who like comedy, black-humor and flicks with amoral end. My vote is eight.",A Fish Called Wanda
7,kosmasp,What was the middle thing?,10,14 June 2020,"I don't even know where to start. Just an all around great cast, with an amazing script! Still Kevin Kline is surely one to watch here. His depiction of criminally insane, completely delusional and quite ludicrous is beyond words to describe. He is mental (the character that is) and you will love him for that. Not in the conventional way of course. But nothing here is conventional. Like rooting for the killing of an old lady. You will understand once you watch.But that does not mean you are bad, if you wish someone to die - in the movie. Because you can differentiate between fiction and reality. And you know what is morally right and morally wrong. One of the movies I've seen more than I can remember. Mostly in the German dub, but I have come to love the original as well. The dubbing was really good I have to admit and was hard for me to shake off.If you have atleast some love for dark humor, you will cherish this. Yes it is mean, yes it does not care about Political correctness and yes that makes it so great. The not sequel ""Fierce Creatures"" never achieved to capture the lightning in a bottle again ... but I have to rewatch that, because I don't think it was as bad as it was received back then. Nevertheless this is the one to watch for sure, if you haven't already. And if you have, watch again! You know you want to",A Fish Called Wanda
8,classicsoncall,"""Alright, I'm sorry I ate your fish, OK?""",8,1 May 2018,"The movie is so witty and entertaining I thought it was better than any Monty Python flick I've ever seen, what with three of those players and Jamie Lee Curtis thrown into the mix. No doubt one needs to pay attention because the jewel caper at the center of the story carries with it an entire set of twists and turns before Wanda (Curtis) makes off with the prize. Many of the situations presented are patently absurd, but what the heck, they're made almost credible by a talented cast working with quick wits and a penchant for hilarity. Kevin Kline is particularly entertaining by being an irritating character; when he once again sniffed his armpit while hanging on for dear life outside the bedroom window I just about hit the floor. The trivia section here on IMDb states that John Cleese actually chose the name of Archie Leach as a tribute to Cary Grant because they were born only twenty miles apart and Cleese felt it was the closest he could ever get to being Grant. Personally, I thought the whole film might have been a tribute to Grant considering what a screwball comedy it was. If you're wondering why it's called ""A Fish Called Wanda"" you'll have to watch the picture. I wonder if Otto swallowed any of those fish by mistake.",A Fish Called Wanda
9,gavin6942,"Pretty Good, Maybe Not As Funny As It Wants to Be",7,20 March 2015,"In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to double-cross each other for the loot.This film's genesis begins way back in the 1960s, when writer John Cleese and director Charles Crichton met and even (unsuccessfully) proposed a comedy film... the steamroller gag allegedly gestated all that time. By the 1980s, both Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis had helped on early drafts to make it more American (Cleese modestly suggests that 13 different people perfected the dialogue). Kline and Cleese had been acquainted since ""Silverado"".What bothers me right off the bat is this idea that Jamie Lee Curtis is attractive and can lure people. This was not the first film where she was used in this way, and certainly not the last (""True Lies""). But it is confounding, because she really is just not the sort of person you expect to be the ""sexy woman"" in Hollywood films. This is not meant as any disrespect to Curtis, but her strong point is not her physicality.That nitpick aside, this was a nice film from some of the Monty Python folks (John Cleese, Michael Palin). Interestingly, neither one of them stole the show -- that honor goes to Kevin Kline as Otto. Maybe I am mistaken, but I always got the impression Kline lingered just below the A-list and just above the B-list, and no one knew what to do with him. A shame. He is a real talent, with an incredible comedic skill. Appropriately, this film landed him an Oscar. According to Cleese, Kline was different on each take, and invented his physicality on the fly (which drove the editor bonkers).For those looking for other Python connections beyond Cleese and Palin, they are there if you dig hard enough. Costume designer Hazel Pethig had been with them since 1969, practically another member. Assistant director David Skynner is the child of Robin Skynner, who co-wrote ""Families and How to Survive Them"" (1983) with Cleese. And you may recognize actor Andrew MacLachlan from wither ""Life of Brian"" or ""meaning of Life"".The film's quasi-sequel, ""Fierce Creatures"" (1997) also starred Cleese, Kline, Curtis and Palin, but was as big a bomb (both commercially and with audiences and critics) as ""Wanda"" was successful. On the other hand, some have alleged that the success of ""Wanda"" opened the door for other British-American films such as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", so perhaps it had other quasi-quasi-sequels that carried the torch.The Arrow Video Blu-ray is a full house, aces high. Beyond the brand-new 4K restoration from the original negative, there is commentary by John Cleese; brand-new appreciation by Vic Pratt of the BFI National Archive; brand-new interviews with composer John DuPrez, production designer Roger Murray-Leach, executive producer Steve Abbott and makeup supervisor Paul Engelen; ""John Cleese's Final Farewell Performance"", a 1988 documentary on the making of the film; ""Something Fishy"", a 15th anniversary retrospective documentary; ""Fish You Were Here"", a documentary on the film's locations hosted by Robert Powell; 24 deleted/alternative scenes with introductions by Cleese; ""A Message from John Cleese"", a tongue-in-cheek introduction; and more!",A Fish Called Wanda
10,lee_eisenberg,something's fishy (in a good way),10,24 October 2006,"Portraying a heist gone awry, ""A Fish Called Wanda"" goes all out in every way possible. Maybe the whole thing is little more than an excuse for a bunch of silly situations, but they have some great ones here. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for the equally funny (maybe even better) ""Fierce Creatures"". This is a comedy classic in every way.Oh, and in case Kevin Kline is reading this: Happy birthday! You're my favorite actor!",A Fish Called Wanda
11,jboothmillard,A Fish Called Wanda,10,11 March 2005,"One of the greatest comedy films ever made. BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated John Cleese plays Archie Leach (Cary Grant's real name), a lawyer who has met and fallen in love with Wanda (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jamie Lee Curtis). Archie is defending the man that helped Wanda and Otto (Oscar winning, and BAFTA nominated Kevin Kline) with the robbery. Also stuttering Ken (BAFTA winning Michael Palin) is trying to kill the woman who was a witness after the robbery. John Cleese has done a very good job of both playing his character and writing (and directing) the film. Kevin Kline does an amazing job as the dangerous and hilarious Otto, he deserves his Oscar. Michael Palin has done a very good job of stuttering and having chips shoved up his nose, he deserves his BAFTA. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Charles Crichton and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Supporting Actress for Maria Aitken as Wendy, Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Jamie Lee Curtis was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 23 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Outstanding!",A Fish Called Wanda
12,Tweekums,Still very funny after almost thirty years,9,13 October 2017,"Set in London four thieves have planned a diamond heist; they are Englishmen Ken and George and American 'brother and sister' Otto and Wendy. The heist is a success but then Otto and Wendy turn on the others by reporting George to the police; unfortunately for them he has moved the jewels to a safety deposit box and given the key to Ken. Now the serous plotting begins; Ken is tasked with eliminating a key witness against George while Wendy attempts to seduce his barrister to try to learn if Georges has mentioned the location of the jewels Otto just makes everything worse.This '80s comedy is as funny as every despite being almost thirty years old some humour, like sticking chips up somebody's nose, doesn't go out of style. The story is relatively simple; for the most part the humour comes from the great characters. Kevin Kline is hilarious as the terminally stupid Otto; a man who thinks he is an intellectual and almost guarantees that their plans fail. Michael Palin is on great form as the stuttering Ken; an animal lover who keeps accidentally killing his target's terriers. His fellow Python John Cleese really impresses as Archie Leach, the initially stuffy barrister who falls for Wendy, played by the excellent Jamie Lee Curtis. The humour is varied so if one gag doesn't amuse you the next probably will although I suspect most of them will amuse most viewers. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any adult wanting a good laugh; some of the content means it isn't really suitable for younger viewers.",A Fish Called Wanda
13,dbdumonteil,there's always someone cleverer than you...,8,16 November 2002,"Charles Crichton may have 78 years old, when he made this movie, it didn't prevent him from making a lively, successful and above all funny. The making is dynamic and inventive. But the main strength of the movie is the screenplay. It's certainly a bit vulgar but it's very strong, inspired and full of little details which kick the bull's eye. Let's add that it contains also unexpected reversals of situation. This, in order to start again the attention and to put forward the characters' cupidity and egoism towards the loot. The best example are the moments when Otto and Wanda are denouncing Georges to the police to take advantage of the loot; but they don't know where the loot is. The other moment is during the trial when Cleese's calling involuntarily Wanda ""darling"". He's betraying his wife and provoking Georges' anger... Above all, it's impossible to neglect the humour of the movie. It's black, caustic and a bit devastating. The greatest moments are: the liquidation of the old lady's dogs. Besides, these dogs are really pieces of junk when they're barking. Otto who becomes an executioner near the end of the movie when he's devouring Ken's fishes so as to make him tell the truth about the diamonds. At last, the actors are irresistible, especially Kevin Kline (he won an oscar for his performance in 1989), fervent admirer of Nietzche's philosophy, Michael Palin, an old and stammerer boy who loves animals.At the end, not any injuries time and a comedy held up by outstanding actors.",A Fish Called Wanda
14,Quinoa1984,the funniest work of Kline's career; a big bang of ultra hilarity and over-the-top jokes of visual and wit variety,9,3 October 2006,"A Fish Called Wanda comes from director Charles Crichton, though much of what makes the film a success is that he just doesn't get in the way of what these actors can do and, more importantly, the material. It's John Cleese as writer and him and Michael Palin as co-stars, so immediately (and especially for me as I saw it as part of a retrospective involving the group) Monty Python comes to mind. It is and it isn't like Python, as this time it does tell really a full-on story without it being too sketchy- 'too' being a loose word here, most particular exceptions being Palin's scenes after the old lady- and it's all really about the wacky surprises and behavior of these characters. It's also the Oscar winning performance of Kevin Kline's career, and possibly still one of the very best that he's ever pulled off. It's shameless at being stupid, which his Otto as a running gag replies ""don't call me stupid"", and also at trying to seem intelligent in his dastardly gangster ways, while supplanting himself with Nietzsche and jealousy around his tease/seeming-to-others sibling Wanda played by Jamie Lee Curtis. It's fearless comedy at it's best, and it's quite possible out of all the good things going for A Fish Called Wanda he's overall the funniest, almost without trying (just seeing his face as he pops up during the rendezvous Curtis and Cleese have is worth the price to check it out).But aside from him the picture works as being a rip-roaring comedy, so to speak, as the comedy ranges from more exaggerated forms of comedy around for ages (i.e. there's someone in the house that shouldn't be, hides, wackiness), to being more explicit (Cleese's Arch strips down for his beau, only to have the people who once had real estate dealings with him see him right then and there), to being almost sadistic (dead dogs the biggest). But there's also room for stuttering, here in the form of Palin's Ken, who is 2nd only to Kline in the big laughs department, as he ultimately ends up missing the dogs he wipes out more than the old lady does herself. His may be a kind of running gag that could wear out its welcome, and in maybe one or two scenes the laughs aren't totally mined, but he also provides some of the funniest scenes, like with Kline, I may have ever seen, like when Arch comes in to ask Ken where the jewels are, and the stutter goes on and on and on (or, for that matter, when he gets 'cured').It also helps that Curtis and Cleese's characters, while often seeming like the 'straight' characters in the film, are also extremely gifted at doing their forms of comedy, and Cleese ends up pulling some unexpected comedic bits the likes of which match up to those of his Python days. His character at first seems fairly bland, an attorney defending a jewel thief (I forget the actor's name), who gets taken in romantically by a 'law student', Wanda, whom he doesn't want to get involved with as she is, of course, a witness for the defense in the case. But in the midst of playing him up to get info, it becomes for both actors something to keep up with Kline's own comedy stylings, his facial expressions and manner of speaking (not just the Italian, of course a highlight). He puts up a well-measured performance alongside all the others, and altogether the main four actors pull off something of an amazing feat; it has the pure irreverence of Python, the go-for-broke silliness done with a slightly more dirty and almost obscene beat, while even having a conventional side to it too with the heist plot. And it makes for a great time if you happen to get to see it in a packed audience.",A Fish Called Wanda
15,Coventry,The Kevin Kline Show!,9,30 April 2005,"Brief and simple: this movie is terrific entertainment! With its uniquely eccentric characters and delightfully absurd storyline, 'A Fish Called Wanda"" unquestionably is one of the funniest films ever made. The exhilarating screenplay works on so many level (a diamond heist gone wrong, Brits vs. Americans, romantic comedy...) and the top-notch cast obviously had an excellent time doing this film-job. There's not a dull moment throughout the entire movie and every sequence contains at least two or three hilarious moments. The humor is very over-the-top at times but, what the hell, it remains a joy to behold. The cast is nearly perfect with John Cleese, Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis at their absolute best. Still, there's one actor who deserves extra praise for his role here and that's Kevin Kline. His hyperactive, deranged and extravagant character Otto is one of the most brilliant roles in comedy cinema ever! His moves, grimaces and monologues will make you fall off your seat laughing. Kline won an Oscar for his role and, everybody who has seen ""A Fish Called Wanda"" will agree on the fact that this was a well-deserved price.",A Fish Called Wanda
16,sunwarrior13,A Vintage Classic Comedy,10,27 December 2014,"A Fish Called Wanda is a heist-comedy film about an ambitious con artist who uses her sexual wiles to obtain a fortune in jewels stolen by George Thomason,her gangster lover.

They bring in con artist Wanda Gershwitz and ""weapons man"" Otto West, a loud- mouthed Anglophobe who fancies himself an intellectual.Wanda and Otto are lovers, but they hide this from George and Ken, pretending to be brother and sister, so Wanda can work her charms on them.

But the ambitious con artist uses her sexual wiles to obtain jewels.First, she romances Georgeson's dimwitted but deadly henchman. Then, to clear the path for her getaway with , Jamie woos Georgeson's starched- shirt attorney whom she genuinely falls in love with. No question about it that this film will definitely provide the viewer a great viewing experience.It has strong performances from its solid cast especially Kevin Kline,who won an Oscar in it.Also,the screenplay was smartly written and engaging.The change of genre in the story is what is definitely surprising as it started as a heist movie and later turns out to be more that what it appears to be as it becomes more complex afterwards as we get to see the goofiness of the characters afterwards.It is definitely a vintage classic comedy.",A Fish Called Wanda

18,Theo Robertson,Too Trans-Atlantic,6,27 March 2003,"I was going to take issue with the IMDB classing this as an American movie but perhaps I shouldn`t . It is financed by American money , distributed by MGM and has both eyes on an American market ,two of the main protagonists are played by Americans while the two main British characters are played by John Cleese and Michael Palin who are well known in the States because of MONTY PYTHON!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!Perhaps this is why I didn`t enjoy A FISH CALLED WANDA as much as I should have since comedy plays second fiddle to appealing to a middle American audience . Anglophobic criminal Otto is a one trick pony who hates limeys and calls them "" A$$holes "" a lot . I`m surprised Kevin Kline won an Oscar for this since he`s far from terrific in such an under developed role . John Cleese plays a sort of surrogate Basil Fawlty which is great but he`s not awarded enough screen time . If the film revolved around Archie this would have been a far better film . The only bits that made me laugh was the sub plot of animal lover Ken trying to bump off the witness but accidentally killing her dogs one by one and the scene in the cell with George and Archie :George : Tell those pigs to f*** offArchie : F*** off pigsOh dear I`ve mentioned all the funny bits",A Fish Called Wanda
19,preppy-3,Way too cruel,5,24 February 2004,"Hit comedy about some thieves--Ken Pile (Michael Palin), Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis), Otto West (Kevin Kline)--and a barrister (John Cleese) who falls in trouble with them.  The plot is way too convoluted to summarize but it involves stolen diamonds, multiple double-crosses, sex, violence etc etc all in a supposedly funny manner.Now this movie does have some good things about it--Cleese (playing the straight man for once) is good; Curtis is just fantastic (and incredibly sexy); Kline is even better in a role that got him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar) and Palin is also good.  It moves quickly, looks great and I was never really bored.But, it wasn't funny.  I didn't laugh once.  I didn't like it in 1988 (some critics weren't too thrilled with it either) and I still don't like it now. For one thing almost all the main characters are vicious and cruel (especially Otto).  This movies idea of humor is violence.  One character is beaten up multiple times and humiliated--all like it's funny.  Another stutters nonstop (that's played for laughs) and is being constantly verbally humiliated and gets maimed in accidents and almost suffocated to death. Another is run over by a steam roller.  Animals are killed, live fish are eaten....To some people this might be hysterical but I found it way too cruel to be funny.  Also, I'm no prude, but did we really have to have constant non-stop swearing throughout the movie?  That also isn't funny--just annoying.I'm giving this a 5 for the actors--and that's about it.  Still, it was a smash hit so it depends on what you find funny.  If you love the Three Stooges this is for you.",A Fish Called Wanda
20,CinemaSerf,"The fish is the only thing with any brains, here....",7,28 March 2020,"30 years on and this gentle comedy has dated a bit; but it is still an eminently watchable comic farce featuring the last gasps from the ""Ministry of Silly Walks"". Four criminals with varying degrees of competence ally to steal £13m worth of diamonds. Well, of course it doesn't go to plan. ""Wanda"" (Jamie Lee Curtis) uses her lover ""Otto"" (Kevin Kline) who really doesn't like being called stupid but can control his lover just by saying ""gelato""! They frame their colleague ""George"" (Tom Georgeson) for the crime and hope to run off with the loot; only to discover that he took precautions and hid the spoils elsewhere under the watchful eyes of his stuttering pal ""Ken"" (Michael Palin). It transpires that there is also witness in doddery old ""Mrs. Coady"" whom ""Ken"" is assigned to bump off - easily the funniest scenarios in this film as afterwards the plot begins to implode - they decided to intimidate the solicitor (John Cleese) who is defending ""George"" and soon everyone is double-crossing everyone else and it loses much of its focus.

Written by John Cleese, and you can see the Pythonesque touches in the script. Helps too that John Cleese and Michael Palin have prominent roles in the cast.Solid plot, so works pretty well as a crime-caper and not just as a comedy.Good performances from a star-studded cast: John Cleese, Jamie-Lee Curtis (as Wanda), Michael Palin (as Ken).

22,Boba_Fett1138,The perfect mix of British and American comedy.,9,19 January 2005,"This movie knows to find the perfect balance between British and American comedy.Both the British and American actors are working excellent together and are a great mix. Both act in their own styles with their own sense of humor. It makes the movie excellent to watch for both the fans of the British humor and the more 'forced' American comedy.The story is really great, especially for a comedy which often just relies on its jokes and comical situations. Sure, ""A Fish Called Wanda"" also has got its weak moments, such as the whole side-plot with Ken Pile trying to kill the old lady. Yes, it's funny in a comical way but it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie.Another thing that distinct this movie from other comedies is the wonderful cast. All of us of course already know John Cleese's comical talent but it really is Kevin Kline that steals the show. The best acting performance I have ever seen in a comedy!

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,What was the middle thing?,8,14 January 2010,"This is an incredibly hilarious, screwball, caper romp. With only two of the Pythons and a director who, I understand, had not done comedy before, you might be worried that it leaves something to be desired, but I can assure you, it is a sharply written masterpiece. A lot of the humor is pitch black, there is cleverness and silliness, vaudeville and sit-com-like sequences, this insists on not being politically correct, and almost no joke or gag falls flat or feels forced. There is a ton of energy in it, and the pace is spot-on. It does not run out of steam at any point, and it doesn't end abruptly. The plot is engaging and very nicely put together; detailed without being convoluted. Editing and cinematography are great, they don't call too much attention to themselves. It all adds up to making this a classic of its genre. This may be the first time Kline behaves like an ass in a role, which has since become his schtick. Jamie Lee Curtis is at her most seductive and sexy in this. The characters are well-written, fleshed out and credible(if not necessarily mentally stable). I was laughing throughout the entirety of this, and would agree that it is definitely one of the funniest films ever. There is plentiful strong language, a bit of sex that isn't graphic in its depiction, a little over the top violence, and it can be rather tasteless(for anyone bothered by that). The Special Edition DVD contains two additional tracks(an interesting commentary by John and a good and amusing factoid one), a handful of well-done, informative featurettes, numerous deleted and alternate scenes with Cleese introducing every single one of them, and some photo galleries. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine enjoying this. 8/10",A Fish Called Wanda
24,view_and_review,Wanda's Way,3,8 February 2020,"There is an Arab proverb that states: ""A man loses one-third of his intellect when his penis is erect."" Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) set out to prove just how true that proverb is.""A Fish Called Wanda"" was four thieves all trying to outsmart one another to get away with some valuable diamonds. I don't want to make it seem as though the four thieves were all on their own because there were alliances amongst the four and Wanda was a part of each alliance. With her feminine wiles and her promiscuity she was able to trick everybody. She showed just how weak a man could be when given sex or even the promise of sex. Two men would kill for her, she helped another stop stuttering, and one man left his wife and his job for her. I think if she really put her mind to it she could've used her vagina to bring about world peace... or a world war. The only thing her vagina couldn't do was make this movie any good. It certainly didn't make the movie any funnier.",A Fish Called Wanda
25,evanston_dad,Monty Python Drafts Some Americans,7,27 July 2008,"For some reason, this screwball caper comedy has always reminded me of ""Ruthless People,"" though I liked ""Ruthless People"" more.Maybe it's just the premise -- a bunch of people looking out for themselves, willing to screw whoever they need to to get what they want. Director Charles Crichton assembled a very good cast, a few of them former members of the Monty Python troupe, but it's the Americans who steal the show: Jamie Lee Curtis, convincingly sexy; and Kevin Kline, who creates an utterly original comic dufus.I know it's just a comedy and not to be taken seriously, but I've always hated the scene when Kline eats Michael Palin's fish.

26,anaconda-40658,A Fish Called Jamie Lee.,8,29 July 2015,"A Fish Called Wanda (1988): Dir: Charles Crichton / Cast: John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, Michael Palin, Maria Aitken: Clever caper comedy with a title that not only references a pet, but also the woman who conned everyone and got away. Plot regards stolen jewels and the betrayal of the leader. Wanda is played by Jamie Lee Curtis who set up the betrayal along with her lover, a weapons expert named Otto, played to brilliant comic extremes by Kevin Kline. John Cleese is hilarious as barrister Archie Leach. His marriage is reduced to spite, and his teenage daughter wails for attention. Now Wanda has entrapped him for information resulting in situations resulting in him being hung upside down out a window, beat up while robbing his own house, and being caught naked by a family of four on a surprise visit. Curtis is sexy playing her options but has a weakness for erotic spoken languages. Kline provides a physical sarcasm with his jealous outbursts over Wanda until he is using a firearm to issue an apology. Michael Palin plays the animal loving Ken whose task of killing an elderly witness results is his most hilariously painful backfires. With a grand supporting cast and director Charles Crichton making his best caper since Lavender Hill Mob. Ending is wayward with humour often in questionable taste, this becomes a brilliant clash of cultures descending in a net that only Wanda can outmaneuver. Score: 8 / 10",A Fish Called Wanda
27,HotToastyRag,Wacky and zany,4,21 May 2020,"A Fish Called Wanda is wacky and zany, and it won the wonderfully talented Kevin Kline his only Academy Award, but it just isn't my cup of tea. I've enjoyed other wacky, zany movies from the 1980s, like Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, but not this one. The plot centers on a group of crazy criminals who want to steal a bunch of diamonds but end up double-crossing each other in the process. If you're a fan of the cast, including Jamie Lee Curtis and John Cleese, give it a shot and see if you like it.Most of the humor in this movie doesn't really stand the test of time, which might be why I didn't like it, since I didn't see it in the theaters. One of the characters has a terrible stutter, and the audience is supposed to laugh at him. Two other characters pretend to be brother and sister so they can have an affair without anyone suspecting. In another memorable scene, Kevin Kline eats raw goldfish as a torture tactic for the owner. It's a very particular brand of humor, and since humor is so personal, I'm hesitant to actually criticize the movie. It just wasn't my style.",A Fish Called Wanda
28,FlashCallahan,Don't call me stupid....,9,28 October 2012,"Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by ""getting close"" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence......The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqué one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture.The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little.The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong.Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick.But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline.It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure.A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.",A Fish Called Wanda
29,safenoe,Charming British-American comedy,7,28 September 2021,"I remember that when John Cleese was interviewed in the promotion rounds for A Fish Called Wanda, he acknowledged the ""Americanness"" of this film. You can see it for sure, and it pays off big time. It's a charming movie, but I'm not sure I could watch it repetitiously.",A Fish Called Wanda
30,The_Void,Absolutely brilliant comedy,10,27 April 2005,"To make a comedy that can be lauded with the comment 'absolutely hilarious' isn't an easy thing to do. It's not so difficult, however, when you are one of the funniest men on god's green earth; and the extremely talented John Cleese has certainly managed to write a fine piece of comedy here. Teaming up with Monty Python buddy Michael Palin and Ealing studios director Charles Crichton, these talented comedians have managed to create a film that is most certainly one of the funniest; laugh per minute and lasting hilarity when it's over, movies ever made. The plot is taken straight from the classic Ealing comedy era (no wonder it works so well) and it follows four crooks that have stolen a bunch of jewels and now decide to double cross one another to take the loot solely for themselves. The plot thickens when the female of the bunch decides that the best way to get the loot would be to get close to a grassed-up co-conspirator's barrister; John Cleese.Aside from an inch-perfect screenplay, A Fish Called Wanda also benefits from a fine cast of actors to deliver it. John Cleese steals every scene he's in, as you might expect, and he more than justifies his reputation as one of, maybe even the, finest British comedy actor ever. He is joined by a talented pair of Americans; Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis, along with, as mentioned, his fellow Python Michael Palin. Kline is certainly one of the most underrated actors working today, and his comic timing in this movie is right on the money. Makes you wonder how much better he could have been used over the years. ""Scream Queen"" Jamie Lee Curtis also does well in the title role; and Michael Palin obviously knows his way round a comedy script. The jokes in the film come thick and fast, and I can't think of a single one that didn't work. It's the big gags that are the real stand out of the movie, though, and one in particular that sees Kevin Kline trying to explain to Cleese's wife what he's doing in their home is absolutely priceless. I nearly fell of my chair laughing. This film is a must see.",A Fish Called Wanda
31,Sylviastel,What happened to George?,9,14 March 2012,"This film is a classic comedy with the perfect cast especially Monty Python players, John Cleese and Michael Palin. Cleese played Archie Leach, a British barrister, who is to defend George in the courts. Michael Palin played stuttering Ken in an unforgettable role about an animal loving hit man. Oscar winner Kevin Kline played Otto in a brilliant comedic performance. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Wanda Gurwitz, the woman who is conning the others. All for the sake of the jewels in this caper that are worth 20 million dollars in 1988, the film was done with John Cleese and Charles Crichton. Both men collaborated in bringing this project to life. Supporting cast included Maria Aitken as Wendy Leach; Patricia Hayes as the old lady Mrs. Coady; and Geoffrey Palmer as the judge in the courts. Anyway, the film was a small project but it grossed millions of dollars despite some negative reviews. While it's very British, the film has it's moments of humor. Every scene is detailed and choreographed to create an effect and get a laugh and follow the storyline. I didn't like the animal cruelty with the dogs or the cats but it was make believe.",A Fish Called Wanda
32,SimonJack,An over the top comedy – one of the best ever,10,30 October 2017,"Please note that this review definitely has spoilers. ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is one of the funniest films ever made. If ever there were a perfect match of a perfect cast and perfect plot, this would have to be it, or close to it. The four leads are hilarious in painfully funny (as in gut-splitting) roles. The film would be considerably less with any one of them missing. Kevin Kline won an Oscar for his best supporting actor role as Otto. It is one of the funniest roles ever concocted, and Kline plays it perfectly. But, very close to him is Michael Palin and his role as Ken Pile. The horror on his face after each mishap in which he ""knocks off"" one of the lady witness's dogs is too much. John Cleese plays Archie Leach, a hen-pecked husband who married into the upper class of England. He's a barrister who has never known anything exciting in life. His is a different humor, and he is hilarious as the somewhat naïve barrister who's slow to catch on to things. Of course, it is Cleese's comic genius that created the story and screenplay, with some help. Jamie Lee Curtis, as Wanda Gershwitz, may be the brains behind the whole caper and story as it evolves. She's also little more than an opportunist who will use any guy to get her millions. She's not cold- hearted, but cunning and conniving. She sells out her boyfriend who was the mastermind of the big robbery caper. And, she is aroused by men who speak in foreign tongues. Otto and Archie accommodate her accordingly, in Italian and Russian, respectively. The scenes are terribly funny. But this film doesn't end with those leads. Some minor characters add considerably to the humor. Maria Aitken's role as Wendy, Archie's wife, is quite funny. Tom Georgeson is very funny as the robbery plotter George Thomason, especially when he realizes that Wanda has sold him out. Geoffrey Palmer is the judge in Thomason's trial. Some of the funniest scenes in the film are between Otto and Ken. These are side-splitting scenes. Make no mistake about it – this film is adult. But it's not raunchy, vulgar or because of explicit sex scenes. The movie takes on political correctness, and has scenes that may offend some people who take things far too seriously and can't laugh at foibles in areas that are important to them. So, humorless dog and animal lovers probably shouldn't watch this film. That's also part of the reason it's not a good film for children. But when those kids get older and if they become mature, this is one film they should see for its wonderful laughter-inducing humor.",A Fish Called Wanda
33,Mr-Fusion,These are the worst people and I love 'em,8,6 November 2021,"Kevin Kline steals this movie. I have to get that out and I'll get back to it in a sec.A comedic caper full of shaky alliances, double-crosses and petty squabbling, A Fish Called Wanda features an ensemble cast, all seasoned players at home with this material and every last one of them bringing the effort. You find yourself rooting for some (Cleese, in particular), even as they toe the amoral waters in this quest for riches. It's a well-written heist with solid talent and great humor.And then there's Kline, the Nietzsche-spouting psychopath whose disbelief and confusion make for honestly one of the funniest characters I've ever known. He's abhorrent and absolutely delightful.I love this movie.",A Fish Called Wanda
34,JamesHitchcock,Ealing and the Pythons,5,28 April 2020,"One might think that the gentle, character-driven humour of the Ealing Comedies and the eccentric surrealism of Monty Python represent two opposite poles of British comedy, but in fact the Pythons appear to have had a lot of respect for Ealing. The Michael Palin vehicle ""A Private Function"" has obvious thematic links with ""Passport to Pimlico"", as does Eric Idle's ""Splitting Heirs"" with ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"". ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is another post-Python film, starring not only Palin but also John Cleese, that pays homage to the Ealing series. Like ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" it is a heist comedy, and it also has certain similarities with ""The Ladykillers"". It was directed by the veteran Ealing director Charles Crichton, who had made ""Hue and Cry"", ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""The Titfield Thunderbolt"". (It was to be his last film).Four robbers pull off a successful diamond heist. The four are London gangster George Thomason, his right-hand man Ken Pile, his American mistress Wanda Gershwitz and Otto, whom George believes to be Wanda's brother. Unbeknown to George, Wanda and Otto are not brother and sister- in fact they are lovers who are planning to double-cross him by tipping off the police. Unbeknown to Otto, Wanda is planning to triple-cross him and keep all the jewels for herself. George is arrested following the tip-off, but Wanda and Otto face a further problem in that they do not know where George has hidden the jewels. To try and obtain this information, Wanda decides to seduce George's barrister, Archie Leach. (A name borrowed from Cary Grant, whose real name was Archibald Leach).The problem with the film is that it is in form a romantic comedy, with Wanda and Archie as the happy couple, but all the characters, almost without exception, just seem so unlikeable. My biggest disappointment was with Palin, who plays Ken. He had shown in ""The Missionary"" and ""A Private Function"", two of the greatest British comedies of the eighties, that his talent as a comic actor matched his talent as a comedian. (The two things do not always go together). Here, however, he is much less assured. Both Cleese, who wrote the script, and Palin himself, obviously want us to like Ken, trying to humanise him by giving him a stammer and making him an animal-lover with a particular liking for tropical fish. (The titular Wanda, named after Ms Gershwitz, is the pride of his collection). It is, however, difficult to like a gangster who is quite happy to murder an innocent old lady just because his boss fears that she might be able to identify him. (There is a running joke about how Ken never manages to kill the old dear herself but always accidentally takes out one of her pet dogs, something which distresses him because in his book canicide counts as a greater sin than homicide). Trying to cast Palin, the British cinema's resident Mr Nice Guy, as any sort of criminal was a mistake; trying to cast him as a supposedly loveable murderer was a crass mistake.Kevin Kline won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Otto, something which surprised me in 1988 and which seems incomprehensible today. Otto is essentially a crude, stupid thug who attempts to hide his crudeness and stupidity by claiming to be an intellectual and reading the works of philosophers such as Nietzsche. Those who accuse Kline of overacting are both accurate and unfair, because a character like Otto, who bears little resemblance to any human being any of us have ever met, demands the most manic overacting if he is to be even slightly credible. Jamie Lee Curtis brings little the film beyond sex appeal; like Palin she tries but fails to make her character likeable. Probably the best of the leads was Cleese. Archie, admittedly, is no boy scout; quite apart from his many breaches of the Bar Council's code of ethics, a man who abandons his wife and family for his criminal mistress in order to live off the proceeds of her crimes is no paragon of virtue. Cleese, however, has never suffered from the burden of being a Mr Nice Guy and here he does not make the mistake of trying to get us to like Archie.There is some witty dialogue, as one might expect with a writer like Cleese. I was, however, left with the overall impression that there is something very mean-spirited about this film. And that was a fault of which the original Ealing Comedies were never guilty. It is something of which even the Pythons were only rarely guilty. Because of my love for all things Monty Python I had high hopes for this film when I went to see it in the cinema in 1988. Unfortunately, those hopes were not fulfilled and I left the cinema feeling disappointed. I recently watched it again, for only the second time, to see if it had improved in the intervening thirty-odd years. I am sorry to say that it hasn't; in fact, it seems to have got slightly worse. The marriage of Ealing and Monty Python has produced a surprisingly ugly child. 5/10",A Fish Called Wanda
35,namashi_1,Simply Hilarious!,9,24 August 2010,"In 2000, the readers of Total Film magazine voted 'A Fish Called Wanda' the 37th greatest comedy film of all time. In 2004 the same magazine named it the 41st greatest British film of all time. Does it deserve to be in that legendary list? The answer is, 'YES'! 'A Fish Called Wanda' is a delicious comedy, that has the most important thing a Film needs, A Perfect Screenplay, Written by Charles Crichton & John Cleese. Some comedies are memorable due to their screenplay, direction, performances, editing... but this 1988 gem has everything working on it's advantage.This Comedy is about a jewel heist and its aftermath. It's a wafer-thin plot, with greed as it's Wallpaper. It opens well, but becomes a non-stop laugh riot as soon as the complications begin. The sequences between Cleese and Curtis, intruded by Kevin Kline, are simply hilarious! Even Michael Palin's plot, ""The Dog Massacre"" lives you in splits. And also the culmination, it's simply superb! Charles Crichton's direction is memorable, thanks to the screenplay, which he and Cleese have written themselves. Alan Hume's Cinematography is good. John Jympson's editing is crisp and spot-on.In the acting department, Cleese is outstanding! He plays his part too wonderfully. Kevin Kline is first-rate. Jamie Lee Curtis looks ravishing, and delivers a flawless performance. Michael Palin is hilarious! Tom Georgeson is plain average.On the whole, If you love COMEDY Films, then this is a MUST for you!

This movie I have just not been able to get away from and lucky enough my mom had this movie on VHS, so I watched it a couple nights ago, and I nearly died laughing at this movie.All the characters, you can't really choose a favorite because of the fact that despite their bad behavior, you love them. I have to say my favorite scene was when Otto was trying to get information from Ken and he tied him up, and when he was sticking the french fries up his nose and eating Ken's live fish. Oh, my God! I was just laughing too hard for words. Every line in this movie is beyond funny and the scenes are just great.

37,MovieAddict2016,"Overrated, But Still Funny. Kevin Kline Steals the Show...",6,27 March 2003,"John Cleese leads an all-star cast in this funny, but overrated crime comedy.Crooks Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto (Kevin Kline) have successfully stolen millions of dollars worth of diamonds from a bank in London, England, along with George and a stuttering animal-lover, Ken (Michael Palin). They hide the stash in a safe, then pretend that they will meet back in three days to fly somewhere away from England. But George goes back, hides the stash in an airport security deposit box, and puts the key to the safe in his pocket. However, he doesn't realize that Wanda and Otto are planning to turn him in to the police and take the loot for themselves. They do so, only one problem: When they go for the diamonds, they're not there. Now they must take a trip to George (who is in jail, of course) to discover where he has hid the jewels. George doesn't suspect Wanda, but suspects Otto of turning him in. He doesn't tell her where the jewels are. So Wanda meets with George's lawyer, John Cleese, the only man who George would talk to, and the only man who could possibly know where the diamonds are. Wands plays Cleese for information, but soon chaos ensues and the plot takes so many twists and turns it's hard to say what happens without ruining some gags.""A Fish Called Wanda"" is probably a bit too fondly remembered. I heard so much about this movie and was really expecting a lot. Yes, it's funny, and yes, it has very funny moments, but I really expected more than I got.Writer-star John Cleese does a good job playing a British lawyer, or bannister, or whatever they are called in England. Curtis does a good job playing a smart thief who uses her good looks and charm to lure men into her trap. Michael Palin is great as a stuttering Ken. But the best of the cast is Kevin Kline as Otto. He is a wild guy who is both impulsive and aggressive. A bad mix. One of my favorite scenes is where he comes in to apologize to John Cleese, and finds a robber in Cleese's home, assaults the robber, then realizes it is Cleese himself, and says, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" then starts saying, ""How was I supposed to know it was you? I mean, what kind of person robs their own home? Hey, yeah, what kind of person robs their own home, you idiot!"" And he starts to kick him. It shows how much of a problem this guy has. Another one of my favorites is just about anytime he and Michael Palin are on screen. Otto's mimicking of Ken (""K-k-ken's c-c-c-coming to k-k-k-kill me!"") ranks high as a gut-grabber. But just about any scene with the two men is hilarious.The script is nice, and doesn't go overboard at anytime. But I still think the film is a bit overrated.I laughed, I had fun, but it wasn't one of the most memorable comedies I've ever seen.

They need the help of a famous barrister (Cleese), so wanda (not the fish... jamie curtis) makes a play for the barrister. It's all perfect timing, and funny as hell. Kline is dumb as a rock, and keeps (almost) screwing it up. It's so much fun, i promise.

39,lasttimeisaw,A Fish Called Wanda,8,29 August 2012,"Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered.There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it!Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end.Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated.A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the ""great work"" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.",A Fish Called Wanda

John Cleese is as close to a straight man as there is, playing the barrister Archie, but perhaps the funniest moment in the whole movie belongs to him as he strips naked while dancing in a friend's condo, only to have complete strangers walk in on him. Jamie Lee Curtis is no horror movie queen here. She is sizzling hot as the sexy and sultry Wanda.

41,Lejink,Almost wanda-ful...,7,20 February 2010,"I've just recently finished Michael Palin's second set of diaries taking in the 1980 - 1988 period, which includes some interesting behind the scenes stuff on the making of his Python mate John Cleese's most successful film ""A Fish Called Wanda"". I'm a big Python / Palin/ Cleese fan and knowing the film had a good reputation (as evidenced by its high average mark here) knew I was onto a good thing.With old-time Ealing director Charles Crichton also on board as co-writer and director it couldn't really fail and so we get a fun frothy sex-farce, where the world's most eccentric criminal band, - the thief, his stuttering mate, double-crossing American sex-bomb girlfriend and her philosophically stupid lover (with thanks to Peter Greenaway), inveigle staid-as-tweed barrister John Cleese his Archie Leach character tellingly named after the real name of the actor who so often played the innocent man swept up by events, the incomparable Cary Grant, in their attempts to get their hands on a diamond-stash.The plot goes into several different comic vignettes, mostly successful and highly amusing before we get to the happy ending as Cleese gets the girl and her the diamond, while stuttering Michael Palin loses his stammer and Kevin Kline his body under a steamroller.Cleese and Palin stand out, the latter in particular in a near-grotesque part, forever the butt of psychotically jealous Kline's scorn and as the plot thickens, a most unusual torture involving fish and chips but not as you'd think. Kline is acrobatic and well out-there pretty much all of the time - for my taste he occasionally overdoes it, while the statuesque Jamie Lee Curtis as usual gets to her underwear and gets to play the hard-boiled tough-talking brainy American female pulling all the strings. She's effective but Cleese calling her the most beautiful thing he's ever seen is pushing it a bit, plus her costumes throughout just tend to highlight how dated the ""Laura Ashley"" look has become. The rest of the cast is filled with staples from British stage and screen, Tom Georgeson (playing a wittily named character George Thomason), Patricia Hayes as a doomed OAP witness, Geoffrey Palmer, Maria Aitken and even Stephen Fry in a brief scene near the end.It's all good lively fun and there are several scenes you'll remember with a smile. Little bits are over-written and overplayed, Palin is right in his diary when he asserts that Kline's return outside the plane window is wrong, plus the awful 1980's soundtrack and fashions date it a little but this is still an entertaining romp peopled by familiar faces having fun with a crazy knockabout plot at which Cary himself wouldn't turned up his nose.",A Fish Called Wanda
42,ElMaruecan82,"Comedic writing, acting and directing elevated to British Knighthood level...",10,24 March 2016,"(And if the title sounds pompous, keep in mind the film was nominated in these three categories, and won for Acting).First, there's a look of tense shock followed by disbelief, just like after bad news, then it's like an invisible brush drawing an ecstatic smile while the eyes fly till the seventh sky. Then the eyes get closer one another and form with the mouth a weird grimace, like turned on by some aphrodisiac fragrances, then the eyes are closed and the lips disappear under a bushy moustache, in order to capture the elation of the moment and make it as long as possible. Finally, a goofy animated-like grin is like telling us ""you know what? I'm happy""' In case you didn't get it, this is Kevin Kline having his orgasm after the frenetic love scene with Wanda, a moment that lasts only 10 seconds but on the field of comedy, is like an eternity one that lets time to meditate on the greatness of ""A Fish Called Wanda"". Kevin Kline would win an Oscar for his performance as Otto West, the egomaniac lover who uses his reading of philosophical books as alibis against the 'stupid' word, but his actions constantly beg for such an epithet. Kline's performance is the highlight of the movie, which is saying a lot, when you consider the cast.The film opens with a jewel heist followed by an interesting game of double crossing and triple crossing. George, the mastermind and seemingly Wanda's lover, moves the jewels, a good precaution, because he didn't know Otto just gave him to the Police. When Otto finds out there's no loot in the agreed location, he's ""disappointed"", ignoring that Wanda was just about to knock him out. George risks the prison as he's also the only one to be identified by an old lady who saw him after the heist; he gives Ken the key of the safe containing the loot, and asks him to kill the eyewitness. Wanda sees Ken hiding the key, so all she needs is to know where the jewels are, and this is information only Archie, George's lawyer, can get.If that sounds complicated, it's not even ten minutes of the film; everything is set-up so that the rest of the movie works as a constant comical pay-off. This is why I believe any aspiring comedic screenwriter should watch ""A Fish Called Wanda"". Each element of its complex mechanism works perfectly and contributes to one of the all-time best comedies. Of course, it helps a little to have two members of the Monty Python troop among the cast, especially when, one of them, also participated to the screenplay, but this is not a Monty Python movie, it's a traditional comedy that knows perfectly where it goes and what it needed, in order to work; starting with the characters.Characterization is integral to the film's success, as each protagonist is very specific and once everyone's exposed, there's no doubt that their interactions will be full of comical delights. Wanda is a sexy, manipulative thief who'd go to no-limits in order to get the jewels, and charming someone is her answer to everything. She does have two weaknesses though, she can't resist to a man speaking Italian, or any foreign language for that matter, and the second is Otto's jealousy that will constantly undermine her attempts to seduce Archie. Otto, behind this palindrome, is one of the greatest comical creations of the 80's, a man so wrapped up in his own ego that he dismissed anything contradicting his views and plans, and don't ask him what he thinks of English people.Archie Leach is the lawyer, far from John Cleese's usual leader-type and uptight characters, his timidity and passiveness doesn't conceal all his charm, he lives like a rabbit behind cages with Wendy (Maria Atkein) a bossy bourgeois wife and a spoiled teenager played by Cleese's daughter. His job seems like the only form of entertainment he can afford and Wanda making her entrance will have the effect of a sunshine lighting in his life. Finally, there's Ken, the stuttering animal-lover who takes care of his fish in an aquarium, the most beautiful one being named Wanda. Michael Palin makes his Ken a lovable guy, and the only loyal associate. But loyalty doesn't make him redeemable when you think of his main occupation during the film.The script, the interactions between the characters, and the humor always work hand-in-hand in ""A Fish Called Wanda"": if a scene doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile and works as a set-up to a hilarious moment. And over the course that will lead our four goofballs to the climactic race to the loot, each one is basically busy doing something. Wanda is busy seducing Archie. Otto is busy keeping an eye on them because he's a sickly jealous human being. Archie is busy playing cat-and-mouse with his wife. And Ken is busy trying to eliminate the old lady, yet ends up killing her Yorkshires, one by one. Never has an animal's death has been so funny in film, especially as a running-gag, but as cruel as it is, in a sense of poetic justice, Ken also pays the price to his actions, in one scene that magnificently captures the iconic fish and chips duality and gives a so-British flavor to the film.Still, when it comes the most hilarious and most defining moment of the film (and any 80's comedy), I'm partial to the sight of a shocked naked Cleese naked using a smiling woman's picture to cover his crotch. Another short moment, even shorter than the orgasm, but that is enough to let you meditate on the greatness of ""A Fish Called Wanda"", a film that somewhat allows American and British Humor to play in the same league, and the result is so funny I think it should be knighted.",A Fish Called Wanda
43,paul2001sw-1,Not Cleese's best,6,11 January 2007,"The great John Cleese starred in two post-Monty Python films in the mid 1980s: 'Clockwise' is arguably under-rated, but 'A Fish Called Wanda' was a huge commercial success. This is actually surprising, as the film is only fitfully amusing, with its obvious (and commercially-minded) Anglo-American theme. A bigger problem, perhaps, is that Cleese himself plays a relatively straight role, leaving it to Michael Palin (never the funniest of the Pythons, and here merely annoying) and the always annoying Kevin Kline to attempt to deliver the laughs: the film only really becomes funny in its second half, when Cleese is finally allowed to show us his talents. Another point of note is that the Python-esquire vision of Britain, maybe enhanced by the use of veteran Ealing studios director Charles Chrichton, is starting to look dated: the world shown is a parody of contemporary life, but no longer accurate enough to be considered satire. There are still some funny moments here, but for a true demonstration of Cleese's greatness, look elsewhere.",A Fish Called Wanda
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Three crooks and a lawyer.,6,9 June 2020,"'A Fish Called Wanda (1988)' is a farcical comedy focused on a group of bank robbers who each try to outwit one another and take all the goods for themselves. The most machinating member is Curtis' Wanda, who uses everything - and everyone - at her disposal to wriggle her way above the competition. This includes seducing married lawyer Archie, portrayed by Cleese, and this is arguably where the meat of the movie resides. Their relationship evolves over the course of the narrative and it also acts as a catalyst for much of the comedy. Things are typically quite broad and, though there aren't any hilarious moments, the piece is generally enjoyable throughout. Some of the comedy feels quite cruel, in a way, and a few scenes are honestly a little grating. Dog lovers should watch with caution, let's put it that way. Still, the movie is, first and foremost, a bit of lighthearted fun. Its narrative is pretty basic but there are a few twists and turns that keep things feeling fresh. It's mostly inoffensive fluff that does its job rather well. It's entertaining enough. 6/10",A Fish Called Wanda
45,Cineanalyst,She's No Fish,8,12 November 2018,"""A Fish Called Wanda"" is so funny that it has the dubious distinction of having killed a man from laughing too hard at it (seriously, look it up). Oddly, Monty Python alum John Cleese, who wrote the script and also stars, gave the more-exaggerated comedic parts to the two Americans (played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline), whilst he and the other English actors play the straight men--although fellow Python Michael Palin employs a stutter for his Ken and has a running gag involving his love for animals and witnessing them die. This is mainly a play on the English supposedly being stuffy and stereotypes of Americans as exuberant, gun-toting dimwits. The Americans both lack and desire culture and sophistication. Curtis's Wanda becomes sexually aroused from hearing foreign languages spoken, and Kline's Otto, too stupid to even know that he's stupid, misunderstands the philosophy that he reads. Meanwhile, Cleese's Archie Leach lacks the suaveness of his namesake Cary Grant but, nonetheless, is composed enough to form an eloquent apology when Otto dangles him upside down from an upper story window.In another sense, the English are stooges to the American con artists. The Americans are actors playing actors, and Curtis and, especially, Kline in an Oscar-winning performance are terrific. It's something of a testament to Cleese's reported welcoming of collaboration that his character is the least hilarious of the four main parts. Contrary to Ken's fish also-named ""Wanda,"" Curtis's Wanda is no fish, but rather a femme fatale, and the film gets a lot of gags from her and Otto posing as siblings while secretly being lovers, which is a doubled ruse by Wanda, as she plans to betray him over their loot from the heist. Meanwhile, the relationship comes across to others as strangely incestuous due to Otto's continued jealousy and seeming intimacy with his supposed sister. The scenes of him spying on her affairs with other men are especially humorous in how he abruptly and conspicuously appears.My one complaint is that after test screening the re-shooting of some scenes over emphasized the romance between Archie and Wanda at the expense of her role as femme fatale. This also diminished the ironic wordplay of the title by, in effect, making Wanda a bit of a fish--another prize for the hero of a romantic movie. I prefer the original end shot on Wanda's shoes, which were designed to look like a shark--not a fish.",A Fish Called Wanda

50,johnnyboyz,"Ill nurtured trans-Atlantic relations abound, as the drawing out of too many jokes of a misjudged nature and other daft content take centre stage.",5,30 May 2010,"A Fish Called Wanda is hit and miss, combining a number of interesting and somewhat amusing scenes in which performers get pretty much the best out of the material blended with some darker and nastier content that becomes particularly evident later on. The film is a sweet and intriguing enough caper movie for the best part, combing a number of elements and taking time to pay special attention to character but all too willing to bank off into a rather disappointing and rather grotesque revelling in both sadism and deceit. By the time this jumping about has really upset the balance of the film, it has branched off into a realm of escapism and systematically tried to bring these immoral characters down a few pegs that sees both their actions and attitudes punished; we allow the film to roll in the filth of its straddling a line between what's funny and what's rather sickly before accepting the fact that in order to offer stark demonisations of said actions, it needs to peel off onto a strand for its final third that sees all many of wacky, zany and nutty misadventures play out and then tie up. It's spasmodic, inconsistent and not particularly funny.The film is a combined effort from both Britain and The United States, bringing in a range of talent for roles both infront of and behind the camera from either nation. It sees them work together, against each other; but further still retain their differences when not in direct conflict with each other. The film, produced nearer the end of Thatcher's reign as prime minister of Britain, sees a communication in British and American relations break down or fall apart, with a key relationship between two characters of different genders and origins looking like the kind you dream of in its perfection, although in reality, sordid agendas and false promises lie beneath the surface. As Thather's reign came to an end, and a key ideology in her time in power in forming a stronger bond with the American people and government began to go with her, A Fish Called Wanda is rather an ultimate representation of a tie which appears to work quickly; ruthlessly and efficiently when on the same plain but one that progressively falls down and gets weaker when elements of mistrust sneak in.The main players are two American criminals named Otto (Kline) and Wanda (Curtis); co-writer John Cleese's lawyer named Archie Leach as well as stammering animal lover, but crook all the same, named Ken (Palin) who are both Englishmen. After three of these people minus the lawyer rob some diamonds during a daylight raid with George (Georgeson), he is arrested and sent to prison after the Americans give away his whereabouts with the plan being to swipe what they stole and high-tail it out of there; only the diamonds are stashed somewhere only George knows and their plan has backfired. Thus begins the hi-jinks and the farce, Wanda attempting to get into Archie's life so as to help get George out of prison as soon as possible with the eye to take it from there.The film's comedy sits uneasily with its jovial and upbeat attitude to events, with degrees of xenophobia towards the British; bouts of sadism in the odd torture sequence; gross mistrust as well as various patches revolving around animal cruelty the bulk of the content around which the laughs are meant to rotate. Each character has waltzed in from different films, while the odd added ingredient of Jamie Lee-Curtis coming across as playing three or four different roles within her role becomes more and more apparent. Otto and Wanda are certainly charismatic, the pair of them creeping along a line that separates them from either likable rouges or despicable creations whose antics we're meant to be amused by; Otto's hatred of the British and rampaging negative attitudes towards most items reigned in by co-crook and lover Wanda as this match to Otto's indulgences in academic texts and dangerous urges to check up on Wanda when she's supposed to be posing as a lover to somebody else. This, as Archie and his flailing relationship with wife Wendy (Aitken) plus daughter Porita in a large detached house is given due attention; the different parties' attitudes towards sex and sleeping with one another given particular attention as young and loose American criminals occupy one strand and the rich, more refined, more sensible Englsih occupy their space on another.So it's with a great relative interest when Wanda and Archie come together, her posing as a student in love with him and his work seriously clashing with the aforementioned professionalism embodied within Archie. Their scenes are relatively amusing, Lee-Curtis doing well as a performer within a performance playing the role of a brother to Otto when undercover; a student-then-seductress to Archie when she's with him and a moll of some sort when sharing the screen with Otto in regards to whom she has her own agenda. The film is uneven, running on the farcical nature of the situation to drive the film without any underlying substance while the reoccurring gag of an individual with a stammer grows as old as it does offensive relatively quickly. Cleese is in his element when channelling one of those many exchanges and scenarios that usually played out in 1970s TV show Fawlty Towers when a comic situation involving he and a few others peaks whilst attempting to prolong the affair he's having with Wanda, but genuinely funny moments such as these in which the performers are in their element are few and far between. If it's popular, it's because it doesn't ask much from an audience most probably all too willing to laugh at anything anyway thus creating a distressing and wavy tone to a film running a relatively amusing premise.",A Fish Called Wanda

52,TheMovieDiorama,A Fish Called Wanda swimmingly sails through a screenplay fishing for eccentricity.,8,6 January 2020,"You may or may not already know, that comedies are not my genre of choice. The heartless individual that I am fails to grasp humour in its entirety, finding the most unusual of gags hilarious yet the most mainstream of jokes unwaveringly pointless. ""Classic"" British comedy, despite being a patriotic Brit myself, is just one of those strands I've never tangled with. 'Monty Python' and 80s sitcoms reassure my darkened thoughts where most others would laugh out loud, for I am dead inside.Naturally, approaching this classic that many deem utterly hilarious, had me both anxious and intimidated. All the signs were there indicating that I would not appreciate this. Two 'Monty Python' actors, in Cleese and Palin, teaming up yet again. A femme fatale central character that utilises her sex appeal to acquire anything and everything. British versus American colloquialisms. Yet, despite all these elements being fruitfully incorporated into the feature, I flippin' loved A Fish Called Wanda! A gangster, animal lover and two American con artists plan a jewel heist, to which the eponymous Wanda attempts to double-cross them.Comedy, in my opinion, is most contagious when written well. The visual aspect is a product of the screenplay and performances. So when I acknowledged that Cleese himself wrote this hilarious screenplay, especially after the groundbreaking success of 'Fawlty Towers', I breathed a sigh of relief. The man is comedy gold, and I'll tell you why. A Fish Called Wanda isn't a string of random set pieces to which the characters must adapt to in order to achieve a comedic response, a formula commonly used in modern ""hilarity"". Rather it's actually the same scene repeated, but with comic illogicality emphasised with each repetition. Wanda insists on seducing George's barrister to obtain information. Simple? Yes. Durable? No.Ingeniously, Cleese continues the affair throughout the entire feature, and solely focussing on the dynamics between Wanda and Archie. When does the hilarity ensue, you ask? Well, it's the unwanted surrounding characters that heighten the situation into the comedy stratosphere. Archie unexpectedly greets his wife when Wanda is hiding behind a cupboard door, after some ""necrophiliac"" foreplay. Her locket is dropped (vital plot point!), wife sees it and instead of exploding in anger at the possibility of Archie's betrayal, she believes it's a gift and decides to wear it. This is without mentioning Wanda's ""brother"" who walks into the room and pretends to be an agent investigating KGB operatives in the local area. Oh, and Archie's daughter is waltzing in and out of the scene to make matters worse. My description doesn't do it justice, but each time Wanda and Archie are together, the scenario constantly escalates. It really is edge of your seat comedy, and I can confidently state I was flailing my arms about like a fish out of water whilst laughing the house down.Situational comedies like this, when written incredibly meticulously, are able to re-ignite my soul. However, these sequences of awkward hilarity would not be possible without the detailed characterisation that seeps through the screenplay. Each character implements a unique trait and differing style of comedy into the fray. Archie and his general buffoonery. Wanda and her insistence on sex appeal. Otto with his disapproval of the word ""stupid"". Ken with his on/off stutter. These are just the crust on the fish pie, for there are a ludicrous amount of personable qualities that bring these characters to life. And that is what makes the comedy feel so effortless.Crichton, in what was his last directorial feature, solely placed Cleese's writing at the forefront. No ostentatious camerawork or intelligent editing. With that, it can feel somewhat rough around the edges. The constant switching between Wanda's shenanigans and Ken's progressive task of murdering a witness (by killing her beloved dogs instead of, y'know, her!), were abrupt and occasionally disjointed. Fortunately the rounded performances secured a narrative momentum throughout, never once depleting. Cleese, Curtis and Palin were exceptionally decent, yet it was Kline's excessive screaming and shouting that generated comedy excellence. Yes, the homophobic slurs are now outdated and unfortunately taints a portion of his character, especially since he continually maintains this remark throughout. But I appreciate that's a personal issue more than anything.The characterised comedy is what matters. These minuscule fishes in the medium-sized pond that is Britain, swimming around causing hilarity wherever they rest their fins. Bolstered by fantastic performances, an engaging story and exceptional writing, Wanda certainly is a fish I shall be remembering. Modern comedy just cannot replicate this exemplary feature.",A Fish Called Wanda
53,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Whatever you do, don't call it stupid",8,9 July 2008,"""A Fish Called Wanda"" is not your typical comedy which is its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. It is a crime comedy that curious merges British humor (the Monty Python sensibility led by writer and actor John Cleese) and American humor (the over-the-top performance from Kevin Kline). Often times this works for some great laughs and other times it'll leave you a bit confused, but overall it's a fun movie with an unbelievable set of characters and a plot that only pushes these actors to do their best.The film plummets you right into the action as 4 strange individuals all collaborate to rob a bank of 20 Million in diamonds. When 2 of them, Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of the others, the double crossing, seduction and lying continues in the interest of the characters getting their hands on the diamonds and walking away.These characters are just terrific. Kevin Kline is every bit Oscar-worthy in his role as Otto, the eccentric, clueless, risk-taking,self-assertive criminal (but not stupid...) who thinks he knows best all the time. He stands out as one of the best character roles in a comedy of all time in this film and that's not overstating it. Jamie Lee Curtis, while you wouldn't think to be your first choice for a seductive, manipulating and completely self-absorbed criminal but she commands the attention her role requires so easily. Monty Python greats John Cleese and Michael Palin also add that distinct Monty Python brand humor to the film that makes it so unique. Cleese plays a lawyer that gets wrapped up in the double-crossing and Palin plays a stuttering, fish-loving, sympathizable sidekick. If you can't tell by now, let me reiterate that this comedy is all about the characters.The plot here is enough to keep the antics going and that's what good sketch comedy (which you'd expect from a John Cleese) does. It takes a bit for you to adjust to the humor, but once you get beyond the fact that they're not just being weird to be weird, there's a bit more too it, this film goes from being just okay to really enjoyable. While I think it could have done better in terms of a satisfying plot, it wasn't enough to keep the film from identifying itself primarily as an absurd, off-the-wall and over-the-top crime comedy. Don't expect flashy, slick slight of hand crime comedy here, just some really silly but unique laughs.",A Fish Called Wanda

It also enjoyed 6 other wins and 15 nominations, and deservedly so!This is the funniest rom-com ever made. Totally wonderful performances from a star-studded comedic cast showcase this huge hit from 1988.

It appeared as though they really were fast friends, lovers, would-be lovers, and has-been lovers. While the production itself was suspenseful and witty, the relationships were relaxed and easy and played out just as if they were real.Kevin Kline was delightful as the psychotic, sex-crazed, boot-sniffing, insanely jealous lover. He was completely believable in this inventive role as Jamie Lee Curtis' diabolical lover, pretending to be her brother, pretending to be interested in Ken.John Cleese's character was soft and sweet, and totally endearing, while Jamie Lee Curtis (AKA: Wanda) demonstrated pure talent as the obvious, borderline Machiavellian seductress. There wasn't one moment of wasted film, one mis-timed scene, or one lapse in performance quality. Every comedy should aim for the standards set in this work.These types of movies either have it, or they don't. There are no effects behind which to hide poor performances.

Not only does she prove she can act, but she can act along side the likes of monsters Kevin Kline and John Cleese. And not only can all of them act, plus everyone else in this movie too, but they all have to act as different people whenever another character enters the frame... sometimes, especially in the case of Kevin Kline, changing pace effortlessly in a single take.Whereas that's not quite overwhelming, the context is: this movie also manages to be really funny and have a pretty wacky plot. It's a slapstick, screwball comedy of errors with things to say about American-British relationships, heist thrillers, and English manners. It manages to work, but also to keep it simple despite it's fast pace: everyone either wants sex or wants money, and where those things occur accidents are just prone to happen.It's not usual for something so 80s, so mainstream, and so full of familiar faces and pop culture references to be considered a ""classic"", especially when it's just a really good comedy, but this shows that even relatively straight-forward entertainments can transcend its appeal to become art.--PolarisDiB",A Fish Called Wanda

The film pokes broad fun at English and American attitudes, but from a too narrow perspective.

59,jimbo-53-186511,Is it really that funny?,3,22 May 2015,"It's my understanding that A Fish Called Wanda is often regarded as one of the funniest films of all time. However, after watching it I'm perplexed as to why it's quite so highly regarded as to me it was barely funny at best.There isn't much wrong with the basic idea behind the film and the idea of the protagonists double-crossing each other in an attempt to get the stolen loot certainly holds a lot of promise, but sadly this was just a really big missed opportunity.For a start, the characters aren't very well-written and sadly the gags are very one- note and repetitive. Michael Palin's character Ken Pile has a stutter and that's about it - it's mildly amusing at first, but when that's the only funny thing about his character it wears thin very quickly. I'm also surprised that Kevin Kline won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Really? Perhaps he should have won the award for Best Overacting Actor. God was he irritating in this film - he shouted all the time, randomly spoke in a stupid Italian accent for no apparent reason, and he was just generally annoying. Later in the film we see Pile trying to take out a witness to the robbery, but every time he tries to kill her he ends up killing her dogs - it wasn't that funny the first time, but to have this as the only running gag shows a real lack of imagination and I must admit that this is very lazy and disappointing (and as one of the writers Cleese must burden some of the responsibility for some of its failings).The only moderately interesting aspect of the story was the relationship between Wanda and Leach. Leach is a believable character - a middle-class man stuck in a loveless marriage who merely wants a bit of excitement in his life. Leach is quite a likable guy & Cleese's dead pan expressions and excellent comic timing do help to keep the film mildly tolerable. It's a shame that the material here is thin and largely unfunny. However, Cleese's and Curtis' acting are the best things about this film and their scenes together are easily the best in the film.However, the final nail in the coffin was the ending which I found to be utterly ridiculous and totally unbelievable. A Fish Called Wanda is a film that seems to be loved by the masses, but it's appeal is something of a mystery to me.",A Fish Called Wanda

61,kirbylee70-599-526179,Set Aside Nemo and Watch Wanda,9,23 October 2017,"I'd forgotten just how funny A FISH CALLED WANDA was. Yes I'd seen it when it was released, watched it on both video and disc but it had been a while. With this new releases I'd thought about the film as being funny but didn't remember how funny it was. I found myself having to pause the film on occasion because I was laughing so hardand then backing up moments to watch and laugh at them again.The story revolves around a group of thieves who have successfully pulled off one of the biggest armed robberies of all times. Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson) is the head of the gang, Ken (Michael Palin) his stuttering relative, Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) his girlfriend and Otto (Kevin Kline) the muscle of the group and Wanda's brother. Except that he isn't really her brothers but her boyfriend who's there to help her steal the entire haul.Setting up Georges to take the fall he is arrested. Unbeknownst to the pair he took precautions and moved the jewels from the safe they were in and passed on the key to its new location to Ken. Ken hides the key but Wanda finds it. The only problem is she has no idea where the safe deposit box is that the key belongs to. To find out she decides to seduce the barrister handling George's case, Archie Leach (John Cleese).While all of this is going on Georges tells Ken he must help by taking out the witness who claims she saw him commit the robbery, an elderly lady who owns three yorkies she holds dear. His attempts and failures at trying to follow through with this leads to some of the funniest moments in the film though the dark comedic nature of what happens will undoubtedly upset some viewers.Wanda's seduction of Archie goes as planned with a few hitches thrown in thanks to Otto. Otto is one of the funniest characters in the film. Not quite a dim witted as some might think but definitely close, Otto considers himself an intellectual because he reads things like Nietzsche and takes high offense to anyone calling him stupid. His jealousy of anything involving Wanda leads to some more hilarious moments.As the movie progresses you begin to wonder just who will end up with the jewels by the final credits. Characters found to be living in situations they're unhappy with (both Wanda and Archie) will find resolution while others will be left to face the consequences of what they do. None of them will come out unscathed in one way or another and along the way all will provide so much laughter you'll find yourself like me, pausing to recover from time to time.Fantastic acting is found by all here with special note to both Kline and Palin who create two memorable characters that will make you laugh when remembering them. Cleese has written a comedy masterpiece here and was even nominated for an Oscar for this work. Curtis displays a flair for not only playing the femme fatale but showing she has the acting chops to pull it off. In all the movie shows that the right combination of wit and slapstick can be combined to make one of the best comedies of all time.Once again Arrow Video has outdone itself offering a 4k restoration of the film for the cleanest look possible. Extras abound here and include a commentary track with writer and star Cleese, an appreciation by Vic Pratt of the BFI National Archive, interviews with composer John Du Prez, production designer Roger Murray-Leach, executive producer Steve Abbott and makeup supervisor Paul Engelen, a 1988 documentary on the making of the film called JOHN CLEESE'S FINAL FAREWELL PERFORMANCE, SOMETHING FISHY a 15th anniversary retrospective documentary featuring numerous interviews, FISH YOU WERE HERE a documentary on the film's locations hosted by Robert Powell, 24 deleted and alternate scenes with introduction by Cleese, A MESSAGE FROM JOHN CLEESE a hilarious short recorded for the film's original release featuring Cleese, a gallery of stills, a trivia tack, the theatrical trailer and for the first pressing only a booklet with writing on the film by Sophie Monks Kaufman.",A Fish Called Wanda

Their combined comic genius really made me laugh out loud.I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this film and have in fact avoided it because I'm not a fan of John Cleese, but he plays his part well too.Overall there is no one that lets the cast down.It's a bit slow to start, but once you get in to it, you'll find it's very enjoyable. Not one that would top my list, but certainly good enough to score fairly high.It's quite a simple story and easy to follow and the jokes, while sometimes a tad farcical, are brilliantly timed and delivered.698.19/1000.",A Fish Called Wanda
67,triple8,"A movie to be admired for the cast, definitely not the plot.",4,27 December 2003,"It's funny how a certain movie that one person may find fantastic will not illicit the same response in another person. Such is the case with this movie. I know of several people who rank this as one of the best comedies ever made. I don't feel that way, although I do think Wanda had some funny MOMENTS , there is no way I would call the movie as a whole, a perfect comedy. Not even close.Wanda contains a few absolutely hysterical -flawlessly hysterical moments but not a lot quite honestly, and the movie is one to be admired but more for the cast then the plot. I think Kevin Kline's performance was, in the comedic sense as good as it gets. In fact the movie was cast near perfectly. However, this is the type of movie that starts off funny, progressively gets funnier then starts whittling down in sheer funniness and goes into left field into stupidity.I think that maybe because the movie's funniest scenes take place near the beginning and middle so by the end nothing else can measure up. Can anybody watching this REALLY think that:SPOILERS AHEAD THROUGH POST!!The scenes where Kevin Kline eats the fish and the scene where he and Archie tussle in the airport can't hold up against the sex scene with Jaime Lee(Wanda) and the Italion Cheeze talk(which really was hysterical, I gotta say!)? The humor was so good in the beginning and middle, by the end it seemed played out and tired-and I'm sorry but eating fish and nosebleeds wasn't that funny to me, it was kind of disgusting. Just my opinion.Although Wanda was OK as a movie(at times) I really don't think it's a classic comedy. The pureness of the comedy wasn't there, it was redundant by the end of the movie. Way to much cruel humor toward the end too, which frankly, was so unpleasant, it takes the movie down at least a few points on the scale for me with that alone. But I will give Kevin Kline a perfect 10 in terms of his acting. It's one of those movies I don't think was really good but I will remember for certain funny MOMENTS. And like I said, it was a perfectly cast movie if not a really good one and the acting was really good by all. Still, would never make it as my top comedy and as a whole I wouldn't rate this higher then a 4 and that's at most.",A Fish Called Wanda
68,Spleen,Fourteen years have passed; there can no longer be any doubt...,10,4 March 2002,"""A Fish Called Wanda"" is a fait accompli.  THAT it's a great comedy is beyond serious dispute; all that remains is to wonder about is why.I think it's because of the strength of the four central characters. Posters at the front of theatres gave Archie, Ken, Otto and Wanda equal weight, and, as much as is reasonable to expect, the film does too.  Each of the four has a different kind of energy to contribute.  Merely set one of the four against any of the others, or any two of the others, and you're guaranteed a lively scene - and each of the four is a good foil for the world at large, too.  Yet not once are they all brought together at any one time.  We come closest to such a meeting during the finale, when they're all at Heathrow Airport, and we see: Archie and Ken, Wanda and Otto, Archie and Otto, Archie and Wanda, Ken and Otto, Archie and Ken and Otto (in what is for other reasons the film's most deliciously satisfying moment, Archie and Ken interact simultaneously with Otto without once interacting with each other), and, even more briefly, Archie and Wanda and Otto.  If it were mere contrived plotting that was keeping the characters apart, the result would be tiresome ... but that's one of the other great things about the film: the plot is unfailingly logical, and no move is forced.It's one of those rare films where every single thing went right.  Forget about the cunning construction; Cleese's script is FUNNY.  The central performances represent high points in each of the four actors' careers.  I wonder how Cleese and Crichton knew to cast Curtis, Kline and Palin.  The choice is only obvious in retrospect - but now, the thought that Wanda (for instance) might have been played by some American actress other than Jamie Lee Curtis is enough to give me a thrill of horror.Even the musical score is a perfect fit.  It's propulsive.  You won't find yourself humming the tunes, but you will find your fingers tapping out the rhythms.",A Fish Called Wanda

70,Movie-ManDan,Nothing Short Of A Masterpiece! Comedy Or Not.,10,17 February 2021,"It is understandable why comedies are not considered to be as important as others. Comedy is way too subjective for the masses to really hold high merit against more serious films. But there are a number of legitimately great comedies that everyone can agree are truly funny and truly great. Charles Crichton's 1988 masterwork falls into that category.In order for a comedy to truly transcend time, there has to be more than just laughs. It has to be smart and realistic. No lowbrow comedy has ever received high praise. What really helps is how perfect it is. This movie has no flaws, is genius and also has a really far reach. It tries to push itself to be something astonishing.Right away, we are introduced to a quartet of vastly unique and real criminals. George (Tom Georgeson) is the mastermind and is quickly upstaged by the three others. Ken (Michael Palin), loves animals and has a stammer which worsens the more nervous he gets. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the sexy femme fatale whose brains matches her beauty. Outdoing these people is Kevin Kline playing Wanda's lover, Otto. Kline won his Oscar for his ruling performance as the dumbest character who thinks he is a genius.They do a jewel heist that is a piece of cake, until Wanda & Otto try to double-cross George, only to have him betray them first. They turn him over to the police and Wanda tries to get his lawyer, Archie (Palin's fellow Monty Python star, John Cleese), to tell her the whereabouts of the loot. She tries to romance him and keep the jealous Otto on the down-low.Character development is crucial in films. Not only do we get to know these unique characters, we feel as if we have known them for years. The least developed is the Wanda character, but she's still far too interesting and fun to poke fun at. As mentioned, Kevin Kline simply outdoes everyone. Not his fault. When he won his Oscar, River Phoenix (who was touted as being the winner if Kline lost) was the most excited to see Kline win the big one.Plot development is also needed for a truly great film. A fast moving film, the only bits of predictability are that there will be double crossings, nothing more. These characters drive a plot in such a way we don't know what will happen next.1988 was a very competitive year for legitimately good comedies. Aside from this, there was such classics as ""Midnight Run,"" ""The Naked Gun,"" and ""Bull Durham."" It is ""Midnight Run"" that comes the closest to reaching the same greatness as ""A Fish Called Wanda."" Actually, both films are equal. Difference is one is a road movie and the other isn't.Even if there was no comedy, this would still be an interesting film. If the comedy was the only thing here, it would be great too. We get the best of both worlds here.4/4",A Fish Called Wanda
71,Galina_movie_fan,Treasure!,10,29 November 2010,"A Fish Called Wanda (1988) is for comedy what Citizen Kane is for drama, Godfather Part 1 and 2 for gangster epics, and 2001: Space Odyssey for science fiction - it is one of the best in its genre. This is a work of the comic genius. It is always funny and never goes out of breath. The film is shining and sparkling like the diamonds of the highest quality - just like these that made four thieves who have pulled the heist of their lives to stop at nothing, including lies, deceit, backstabbing, and betrayal, in order to possess them. The film was made 22 years ago but time has nothing over A Fish Called Wanda. It has not gotten outdated or stalled and it never will. It is a marvel that can be enjoyed over and over. AFCW has become a cult favorite for my family. Many quotes and jokes from the comedy are the part of our everyday conversations, and we use them often even forgetting where they came from: ""Disappointed!"", ""Don't call me stupid"", ""You have a beautiful speaking voice - when it works"", ""You British think you are so superior"", ""What was the part in the middle?"", ""Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet."" ""When you say ""friendly"", what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?"" There are many more.A Fish Called Wanda is a real ""treasure"", and it is not just my opinion. The film which was a great success with the critics and the box offices when it was released has been included in all possible lists of the funniest movies and the best comedies. I looked them all up. :) My younger son, who lists AFCW as one of his favorite comedies, wrote the review about it and posted on this very site. He says in the end of his review: ""The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well-structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does."" I can add that as soon as it is over I want to watch it from the beginning and experience the magic of great movie making again. Very talented artists participated in making A Fish Called Wanda, and everything in the film turned out simply perfect. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with. John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the ""key"" to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to ""meet with an accident"", even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces as her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, ""the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it...the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people"" who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto. You can write the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more. I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment. I envy such death. And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', ""If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the ""Marriage of Figaro."" (Translation is mine)I just would add - or watch again ""A Fish Called Wanda.""",A Fish Called Wanda

It is definitely a vintage classic comedy.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",A Fish Called Wanda

74,bkrauser-81-311064,Farce Done Right,10,13 July 2016,"Comedy is notoriously hard to review. At the risk of sounding obtuse, the primary goal of a comedic film usually is to (drum-roll) make you laugh. Yet with humor being an overwhelmingly subjective experience, most reviewers (myself included) often don't bother to tell you whether the film has touched their funny bone. Most reviews thus are spent looking at secondary measurable goals the film has to offer such as its novelty, story elements or ability to latch onto the cultural zeitgeist. If you ever wanted a reason for why critics loved the first Hangover (2009) and hated the sequels despite them being the exact same movie, look no further.A Fish Called Wanda succeeds on all counts. It's a stunningly original mix of classic British comedy tropes, scurrilous American vulgarity and farcical characterizations. It provides solid gallows humor, intelligent witticisms, crackling dialogue, excellent cast and energetic pacing. It's also incredibly funny. Not just haha- funny; it's gut-bustingly, rolling in the aisles, sitting alone in front of the TV screen and having the neighbors call the police because there's a maniac on the loose, hilarious.The film begins with a foursome of jewel thieves meeting at an unassuming London flat. Wanda (Curtis) and Otto (Kline) pose as an American brother and sister team while Georges (Tom) and the regularly stuttering Ken (Palin) are natives who are suspicious of their partners (especially Otto). The jewelry heist is largely a success with only one eye-witness placing Georges at the scene. Otto and Wanda promptly double cross their comrades and calls in a tip to further incriminate Georges. They try to make off with the loot but find the volt where the diamonds were held empty. Seeing no alternative, Wanda continues to court Georges while getting close to his barrister Archie (Cleese), believing that the first person he'll tell is his legal defense team.The film then tangles itself into an intricate web of deceit, confusions, happenstances and comedic set-pieces that channel the best of the Ealing Studio comedies only with conspicuously modern sensibilities. That's not mere coincidence either, director Charles Crichton directed The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) arguably the studio's most revered accomplishment. Where most modern comedies ensnare themselves in a snarl of contrivance and a fast processional of deus ex machina moments, A Fish Called Wanda pilots through the such pratfalls with glorious confidence. All the who's who, what's where's and what-not's all disseminate from the characters whose broadness is tempered with specific peculiarities.The characters themselves, while broadly drawn are so well composited and made whole by the actors that you'd swear the ghost of Joseph Kesselring was looking down and smiling on the production.John Cleese's Archie oozes upper crust pomposity and naive gullibility. He's a rube but he's a lovable rube who at times feels like a deadringer to Graham Chapman's various straight-man roles on Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-1974). Fellow Python alum Michael Palin plays a different kind of rube; of the Elmer Fudd variety. His honesty and ineptitude are no match for the intricacies of the plot, let alone Otto's daffiness. There's a reoccurring joke where Otto, in an attempt to keep Ken off his tracks, fakes a homosexual attraction. Sure it's a little dated but within the film's context the joke lands largely due to Palin's deer-in-the-headlights panic. I suppose the added benefit of melding British and American sensibilities ensures that the film is not just funny but funny on multiple wavelengths.Out of all the pitch-perfect characters that populate this film, Kevin Kline's Otto was perfectly designed to steal the show. Seeing himself as one smart cookie, the irony of Otto is not only his puffed up egoism but his complete inability to see Wanda's betrayal. He's like Nick Bottom from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' with a dollop of Daffy Duck added in for good measure.Then there's the rapturous Jamie Lee Curtis who uses her feminine wiles to delirious heights against the men. Her resourcefulness and gamesmanship has a Katharine Hepburn-like quality which is only betrayed by her character's orgasmic reaction to the Italian language. Part of the fun of her character however is her ability to bounce off Kevin Kline's childish impetuousness. In one masterful scene of comedic debrief, Wanda pops Otto's quasi-intellectual bubble by saying ""Let me correct you on a couple of things. Aristotle was not Belgian. The central message of Buddhism is not 'Every man for himself.' The London Underground is not a political movement. Those are all mistakes, Otto. I looked them up.""I could go on and on about A Fish Called Wanda's effortless charm and under-appreciated timelessness. Layered with a plethora of jokes, freakishly good acting and unique sensibilities on top of a clever caper, I simply cannot recommend this film enough. I emphatically implore all to see A Fish Called Wanda to see farce done right.",A Fish Called Wanda
75,JLRMovieReviews,What Would Plato Say about This!,7,27 May 2013,"John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a ""true vulgarian."" And that ""Manfranjensenten"" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression.

77,sme_no_densetsu,A tour de farce from John Cleese & company,8,27 January 2015,"""A Fish Called Wanda"" is a comedic caper movie that harks back to the classic Ealing comedies of the 1940's & 50's. Not coincidentally, the movie marked Ealing vet Charles Crichton's return to directing following a more than 20 year absence from film. His past experience came in handy while John Cleese also helped to bring their co-written script to life on the silver screen.The story concerns a group of varied individuals who join forces to commit a multi-million dollar heist in London, then try to double-cross each other. To further complicate matters, a strait-laced barrister also ends up getting caught up in the mix.When it comes to the four leads, you couldn't ask for better performers. Each of them excelled in their respective roles. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the sexy, duplicitous Wanda. Kevin Kline won an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto, a deadly dimwit who considers himself an intellectual. John Cleese & Michael Palin both won BAFTA awards for their performances, the former as stuffy barrister Archie Leach and the latter as stuttering lackey Ken. The script masterfully combines these disparate individuals in various permutations to great comedic effect.Visually, Charles Crichton's direction showed a keen eye for comedy and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, the John Du Prez score, while not especially noteworthy, has at least aged better than most from that era.In the end, it is the performances that make ""A Fish Called Wanda"" a standout comedy. The four leads make the most of quality writing and direction to spin comedy gold. While I'm not sure that everyone will appreciate the movie's distinctly British sense of humour and farcical situations, I can only say that I found the movie's mix of levity and darkness to be finely balanced on the whole.",A Fish Called Wanda
78,Analog_Devotee,It's OK.,5,2 September 2021,"It was okay. I didn't find it particularly funny and the story wasn't all that engaging. I did enjoy the characters, though, and I'd say that's easily the best part of this film.",A Fish Called Wanda
79,blumdeluxe,A bit hyperactive,6,15 April 2017,"""A Fish called Wanda"" is a very British film. It tells the story of a robbery and how the participants try to gain control over the treasure, leading to a sheer chaos.As often with John Cleese, everything is a bit too loud, fast and hyperactive for me. I love how the film manages to create a chaos through the mix of very different characters but sometimes the very extrovert attempt to make the movie humorous takes the drive out of the plot a bit. The characters sometimes seem a bit too designed and don't really depict believable characters. I see that many viewers explicitly like this side of the film, just personally I don't feel it.This one is not a bad movie, don't get me wrong. It kept me interested and it is not really obvious to where it will lead, so you won't be bored and it even stood the test of time quite well. Nonetheless this is not the first movie that comes to my mind as an Oscar candidate and I have to say that there are better movies less known.",A Fish Called Wanda
80,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Not a masterpiece, but does contain a good deal of comedic gold",7,17 October 2021,"Definitely not flawless. I think it kind of relies on one type of humour a little too heavily (farcical situations + lies backfiring are hilarious, but it's almost overwhelming when that's most of a movie that's almost two hours), and it takes a little while to get funny, thanks to a surprisingly lengthy prologue/set-up. There's also some quite dark moments that might upset some viewers, though I kind of admired how nasty some of the comedy got, even if it wasn't 100% ""funny.""But there are some fantastic comedic sequences in here. The scene involving Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline seperately sneaking into Cleese's house then having to bluff their way out when Cleese's family returns home is just comedy perfection.Also perfect: Kline's performance. Everyone else is funny for sure, but his manic energy is kinda spellbinding, and he's hysterical, stupid, yet also a decently threatening villain all in one- a great character and a great performance for sure.It's more a 7.5/10 than a 7, but I can't quite get it to an 8. Still, it's a very good comedy, and more or less earns its classic status.",A Fish Called Wanda
81,Beta_Gallinger,"There are hits and misses here, but mostly hits",8,20 March 2009,"I was only a toddler when this smash hit comedy was released, so I didn't even know about it until much later. I watched it for the first time a couple years ago, knowing John Cleese and Michael Palin, of Monty Python fame, were in it. I hadn't seen Kevin Kline in anything else at the time, though he's also a big part of the comedy here. During my first viewing, it may not have been exactly what I was expecting, but from what I remember, I thought it was pretty good overall. Watching it for a second time two years later, obviously knowing what to expect this time, I think it was a lot like my first viewing, maybe a bit better.Wanda Gershwitz and the Anglophobic Otto West are an American couple who have come to England, posing as siblings, to join two English criminals, George Thomason and Ken Pile (an animal lover who owns several fish, one called Wanda) in a diamond heist. Wanda and Otto call the police and turn George in, so they can have the loot to themselves, but when they go to claim it, and Wanda is about to betray Otto as well, it isn't there! George has already moved the diamonds to another place, and only he knows where they are! To try and find out where they are, Wanda decides to seduce George's lawyer, Archie Leach. As much as Otto hates to be called stupid, he is not very bright, and his temper could make this mission harder to fulfill.Otto, played by Kevin Kline, is one nasty character, and one thing in the film I didn't care much for was certain comments from him about Ken Pile's (Michael Palin) stuttering. However, for the most part, Kline's character is good for laughs, providing such funny moments as his reaction to seeing that the loot is gone, and how much he shows he hates being called stupid. Most of the laughs probably come from him, but the two former Pythons in the cast (Palin as Ken Pile and Cleese as Archie Leach), are also highlights, unsurprisingly. The sub-plot with Ken trying to kill the only witness, an elderly woman named Mrs. Coady, is dark and tasteless (as with much of the rest of the film), but funny. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as Wanda Gershwitz is shaky at times, but usually isn't a problem.Despite how much of a hit ""A Fish Called Wanda"" turned out to be, there are obviously many people who would strongly dislike it. It's certainly not for kids, and could offend some adults as well, with Kevin Kline's nasty character, Ken Pile's stuttering, animals being killed, etc. It's not for those who will only laugh at perfectly clean, inoffensive humour, you can be sure about that! However, if you're willing to laugh at some dark, tasteless, but well done humour, and you're a fan of Monty Python and/or Kevin Kline, this film could turn out to be a fun romp for you. I'm sure it did for many people who went to see it on the silver screen in 1988, and has for many who have seen it on the small screen in the past two decades since then.",A Fish Called Wanda
82,KnightsofNi11,What comedy always needs to be.,8,29 May 2011,"A Fish Called Wanda is a hilarious tale of deceit, lies, and sex. It tells the story of four people who attempt to pull off a massive diamond heist. Things are going well until the foursome's leader, George, gets arrested and refuses to reveal the location of the stolen diamonds. The group tries to convince George's lawyer to retrieve the information from George and tell them but this only sets off a nutty chain of events as everyone attempts to double cross the other. This is pure comedy done right. The film is hilarious, while also telling a story that is more fleshed out than the average heist film. It is situational comedy meets crime film and it all is pulled off excellently.The only way to correctly start off a review of this film would be to mention just how great the main four characters are and how amazing the actors portraying them are. John Cleese, Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michale Palin could not have been cast in their roles more perfectly. All four of them are so incredibly fitting and they do such fantastic jobs in their roles. Plus, these characters are so much fun. John Cleese plays the lawyer defending the mastermind behind the diamond heist. Jamie Lee Curtis is the lover of said mastermind who is actually going behind her lover's back to steal the diamonds from him and flee the country with her other love Otto. In order to do this she has to get information from Cleese, making Otto jealous. One hysterical thing leads to another and the whole film is fueled by lies and misunderstandings that build on one another throughout the whole film, making for such an outrageously funny movie.This kind of talent in comedic writing is just too rare. Too often do comedies miss out on a good story in order to jam pack the film with jokes. A Fish Called Wanda manages to balance the two and actually tell a story that is fueled by jokes. Unlike other comedies, the jokes tell the story in A Fish Called Wanda, creating an even blend between comedy and story that all meld seamlessly into each other. It is just what this genre is all about. It goes to show that you can tell a story through a comedic medium that is just as good if not better than a story written through a serious medium.The other great thing about this film is that it never forgets it is a comedy. It never forgets to make us laugh and it always refrains from getting sentimental or sappy. It is all about making us laugh keeping us interested through hilarious situations that stretch out through the entire film. The jokes in this film don't just show up and then leave immediately. They stick around and they just get funnier and funnier, always keeping your attention and always leaving you in anticipation of what these characters will get themselves into next. Watching a movie like this is just insanely fun when there is never a dull moment. It really is just what every comedy needs to be.A Fish Called Wanda is a classic slice of comedic filmmaking. It is a film that defines what comedy can be and it exemplifies the level of quality comedy can reach. Even when the film gets a little too silly or something a little too outrageous occurs, you still enjoy the film and there seems to be nothing in here that can drag down my opinion that this is a great film. Comedy isn't my favorite genre of all time, but movies like A Fish Called Wanda make me remember the good the genre brings us and why I continue to watch these films.",A Fish Called Wanda
83,bankofmarquis,A Jolly Good Time,8,2 July 2020,"A member of my family mentioned when discussing the 1988 John Cleese comedy A FISH CALLED WANDA that you can tell much about a person over what part of this film that you like the most. Do you like:a). The John Cleese/Jamie Lee Curtis love storyb). The ""caper""c). The beleaguered, unsuccessful hit-man Kend). The old lady and her 3 dogse). Kevin Kline as OttoFor me, that's easy - ALL OF IT! I find that A FISH CALLED WANDA is a very funny, richly acted comedy/caper that brings forth 4 characters that are easy to spend 2 hours with. Starting with John Cleese as Barrister Archie Leach. Cleese conceived, wrote, starred-in and (at times) directed this film and his ""British humor"" (honed from years as a member of the MONTY PYTHON comedy troupe) is in full force here. He has a reserved appearance about him that covers a wild man underneath yearning to break free.Jamie Lee Curtis is quite good as the center of the film, Wanda Gershwitz, a cunning conman who will stop at nothing - and step over everyone - to get what she wants. I find that Curtis is under-rated as an actress and a comedienne and this picture shows that she can hold her own against 3 comedy greats at the top of their game.The 2nd member of the Monty Python troupe to appear in this film is the remarkable Michael Palin as hapless hit-man, Ken. He becomes increasingly frustrated and frantic -and increasingly funny - as he attempts to complete his assignment throughout the course of this film.But...the real star of this film...and the actor/character that steals the film away from everyone else...is Kevin Kline's Oscar winning performance as Otto, Wanda's erstwhile love who has a very high opinion of himself. It is rare that a comedic performance wins an Oscar - Kline's win is the the last one to do so - but it is easy to see why the Academy decided to reward Kline for it is a committed performance that is wild, wacky and over-the-top, but not overtly so. Kline has been very good in many other pictures/performances before and after this film, but he never reached the height that he reached in this film.The film has veteran director Charles Crichton listed as Director with Cleese listed as co-Director (though Cleese insisted that Crichton did all the work and he only put his name on it to assuage the fears of studio executives over Crichton's advanced age). Well...Crichton does a wonderful job of letting the lunacy explode on the scene while keeping a lid on it and moving the action along at a brisk pace.Wanda is one of those films that people remember fondly, but do not revisit.

86,FilmOtaku,Still brilliant after all these years,8,20 October 2003,"Still brilliant after all these yearsHaving discovered the beauty of Monty Python as an early adolescent, I remember jumping to see A Fish Called Wanda, which was written by and stars two of the original cast members of the comedy troupe.  I remember finding it hysterical at the ripe age of 14, and watching it at 30, I found it just as amusing, if not a little dated.Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin, John Cleese and Kevin Kline (who won a well-deserved Oscar as best supporting actor for his role as `Otto') A Fish Called Wanda does not have a particularly outstanding storyline; heist films are a dime a dozen.  What makes this film stand out from the rest is the intelligent and sharp script as well as the brilliant execution by the actors involved.  Kevin Kline is particularly brilliant as the Nietzsche spewing doofus who is one part sadist, two parts moron.
As previously stated, this film does look dated at times, (you can definitely tell it was filmed in the 80's without paying attention to cars or wardrobe) but this in no way detracts from the sheer excellence of the script and acting.  If looking for a comedy that is not run of the mill or formulaic, this film should not be missed.--Shelly",A Fish Called Wanda
87,rebeljenn,Completely Unflushable,7,24 November 2005,"'A Fish Called Wanda' is an entertaining and witty comedy about a woman who uses men to commit a robbery and to get exactly what she wants - but starts to lose her heart in the process. Unknowingly, these men do not know that they are competing, and these characters all end up getting involved in the madness. The action takes place in London and stars some well-known (and lesser-known) and excellent American and British actors and actresses.The film is rolling-on-the-floor-and-laughing-out-loud funny. The characters deliver an outrageous but believable performance, and the scenarios they find themselves in are the same. (The dialog between Otto and Cleese in their culturist 'hatred' for each other is classic.) This film is highly enjoyable and should be seen by anyone who appreciates good humor. Watch this if you are particularly fond of Anglo-American films. You won't be flushing this fish down the loo!",A Fish Called Wanda
88,barryrd,Hilarious movie,9,18 August 2016,"A Fish Called Wanda is one of the funniest movies ever, ranking up there with the best of the Pink Panther movies. The striptease and dance act by John Cleese has to be one of the best gags ever filmed. Along with the fast pace and humour, the movie has a clever script which makes for two hours of sheer enjoyment. I really liked the humour of John Cleese and the acrobatic moves and language virtuoso of Kevin Kline in a British-American culture clash. You won't forget Kline holding Cleese upside down from the window over a street as he extracts an overblown apology from the lawyer Cleese. Of course the acting of Jamie Lee Curtis who tries to seduce Cleese (and succeeds) while trying to keep Kline from tearing Cleese apart is a ongoing farce. Then there is one of Cleese's Monty Python partners Michael Palin as the stutter stricken roommate of Jamie Lee Curtis. With him, the ongoing battle with the old lady and her little, yapping dogs is woven into the wider story of a diamond heist under the erratic and egotistical Kline. Palin becomes another British punchbag for Kline who is only too pleased to mock his embarrassing stutter which results in laughable and lengthy pauses in mid-sentence. These are milked for Kline to deliver more zingers at the poor Palin character. Director Charles Crichton, longtime director on the British comedy scene, pulled off a great piece of work in this one.",A Fish Called Wanda

John Cleese, who also wrote the script, plays a proper British man who wants to break free. Michael Palin is the stuttering animal lover. Kevin Kline is the typical stupid American, who thinks he is a genius, and Jaime Lee Curtis is the woman they think they know, and love. These four give great performances and work exceptionally well together. Kevin Kline gets the flashiest part and the most fame, but each of the four deserve equal credit. There are classic scenes aplenty such as the Archie balcony dangle, Otto's apology(""I am ss...I am very sss...I am so very very sssaahhh!

90,skepticskeptical,80% Slapstick,6,17 December 2019,"I first watched A Fish Called Wanda a long, long time ago--in the early 1990s! My memory was of having chuckled satisfyingly during the movie, but I had no real memory of what transpired, so I decided to give it another go.Maybe I am getting old, but this time around I did not laugh at all until 26 minutes in, and although I did burst out laughing about three times, that cathartic release was somewhat tempered by the many, many scenes which I found uncomfortable to watch. The humour is basically 80% slapstick, much of which is tasteless, and 20% intelligent.My best guess is that the popularity of this comedy derives from the fact that there is something here for everyone. People who find poking fun at a man with a stutter hilarious probably have never read Nietzsche, and won´t understand the philosophical jibes. Those who find the more intellectual material funny will also enjoy the British-American conflict humour. The cast members from Monty Python probably helped the success of this film as well, at least among throngs of devoted fans.As for me, I can definitively state that A Fish Called Wanda is not my current time slice´s cup of tea.",A Fish Called Wanda
91,bigverybadtom,"Funny In Parts, But Hardly A Classic",6,23 April 2011,"The movie was created as a hybrid of 1940-1950's Ealing comedy and later Monty Python-type silliness. The combination didn't quite work as intended.I went to see it in the theater because of all the praise the movie got, but when I saw it, it had some laughs but it was less funny than I had come to expect. The movie's main joke is about the culture clash between the loud, overaggressive Americans versus the over-mannered, comatose Britons, but the stereotypes are so exaggerated they are more irritating than funny.The movie is somewhat redeemed by the scenes with Cleese and Curtis, but the other leads resort to overacting, which in itself is not very funny. As a crime drama, it's not particularly clever either. I was glad to see it once, but I wouldn't bother again.",A Fish Called Wanda

She immersed herself into the character and portrays her role very convincingly. In fact all the actors do a great job and are very involved, it's just a shame that I did not enjoy the actual movie.

93,movieguy1021,A Fish Called Wanda: 8/10,8,28 December 2002,"John Cleese and Michael Palin may be most famous for their Monty Python troupe, Jamie Lee Curtis for Halloween, and Kevin Kline forbeing in movies, but one of their most memorable movies is the first one they did together. Which one? A Fish Called WandaCurtis is Wanda, part of a diamond group along with Ken (Palin), George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), and her brother Otto (Kline). They pull off a multi-million pound heist in England, and hide the loot. It seems, though, that Wanda and Otto (who aren't actually brother and sister but lovers) want it all for themselves. So they turn George into the police to try to find out where he hid the loot. It seems the only person George would have told about where the loot is would be his barrister Archie Leach (Cleese). So, naturally, Wanda goes up to him and becomes `friends' with him, much to the dismay of Otto.A Fish Called Wanda is a twistful and delightful comedy that shows the new sex comedies that they don't need gross body functions to be funny. I'm not saying this movie is completely tasteful. Ken, who is an animal lover, accidentally kills dogs. But, it's not too explicit.Most of the humor comes from Kline, who always shows up whenever Archie and Wanda are together, and who pretends he's gay and tries to get Ken. Some of those subplots, such as the gay one and Kline hating people that call him stupid, seem to not matter. But it is funny. Cleese's script is full of surprises. And most of these laughs were genuine, unlike the fakey ones from other movies. Who can forget Kline's shout whenever he's in the car? It is a memorable movie.Kline puts up his best comedic performance, and deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He has excellent comedic timing, always putting the joke on at the right time. He had great chemistry with everyone; it seemed to blend in with the lifestyles of the others. Curtis was excellent in a comedic role. Of course, Cleese and Palin are no strangers to comedy. Cleese seemed like a typical British person-stuck up and courteous. He actually talks about that during the film. Palin was great with a stutter that actually is an important part of the film.It seems that A Fish Called Wanda thinks itself as `bad' and `let's offend everyone!' However, it's one of the more tasteful comedies I've seen recently. Its jokes are almost always funny and tasteful, with Kline's trigger-happy attitude that explodes every once in a while. This group, that came back for 1997's Fierce Creatures, were excellent and they look like they had fun together. Which is good for them. However, after the first forty minutes or so, the humor kind of wavers and it becomes a little uneven. There are still jokes, of course, but not as rapid-fire as the ones before. But considering the humor of the film in its entirety, it could be considered a moot point.A Fish Called Wanda is a very hilarious comedy that you'll remember for a while, and looks like it can stick up for repeated viewings, because there are so many jokes you'll forget a lot of them.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and comic violence and sexuality.",A Fish Called Wanda

The makers managed to capture literal lightning in a bottle that they have never been able to recreate.

In it we have Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline playing a group of jewel thieves and how they're all backstabbing each other to get the loot to themselves. When the fourth member of their crew gets captured, thanks to an anonymous tip by Kevin Kline, it's John Cleese as the barrister who supposed to defend him in court.What follows is a series of events where the only witness to the crime is targeted for murder only to have her pets doe one by one. John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis wind up falling for each other. And Kevin Kline winds up stealing the show as the oversexed killer who misinterprets philosophy and thinks that killing is okay.

He is up there with legends like Jack Lemmon and Ethel Merman, who are the main villainous yet lovable characters in the above older movies. His performance as OTTO is so beautiful and so genius, and that he won an Oscar for a comedic role is proof that he is a living legend, and a standout, given that most Oscars are handed out for dramatic movies and roles. And everyone knows comedy is so much harder to do on screen than drama.The versatile Kline used multiple accents and combined American and British humor using John Cleese's terrific script.

99,dr_clarke_2,Essential viewing for fans of British comedy,9,15 November 2020,"Written by and starring John Cleese, Charles Crichton's 1988 film A Fish Called Wanda is essential viewing for fans of British comedy. The septuagenarian Crichton hadn't directed a film since 1965, but his pedigree - including The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt - provides the film with a direct link to the classic Ealing comedies from which it is spiritually descended, whilst Cleese pokes fun at English stereotypes and the love-hate relationship between the British and Americans to great comic effect. More importantly however, it's simply very, very funny.
A Fish Called Wanda is a crime comedy that sees Americans Wanda and her ""brother"" (actually lover) Otto teaming up London criminal George and his friend Ken to steal a fortune in jewels. Otto promptly double-crosses George, but his plans go awry when he discovers that George hid the jewels before his arrest, resulting in a complicated scheme by Wanda to seduce George's barrister Archie Leech in an attempt to find out where they are. Double-crosses, extra-marital affairs and the deaths of three Yorkshire terriers subsequently ensue in a plot that twists and turns, brims with jokes, slapstick and action and follows its own internal farcical logic.
Veteran comic actor Cleese is brilliant as Archie Leech (Cary Grant's real name), writing to his own acting strengths to portray a character who is every inch the sort of stiff-upper lipped, stuffy, sexually repressed Englishman that Anglophobe Otto despises. Trapped in a loveless marriage with his strident wife Wendy, he's easily seduced by Jamie Lee Curtis' seductive Wanda, and risks everything for the sake of a sex with an attractive young woman, experiencing humiliation, embarrassment and violence along the way. Curtis is a revelation, making Wanda both disarming and devious at the same time, whilst Cleese's old friend and fellow Python Michael Palin is entirely convincing a stuttering animal-lover Ken, especially when he's being tortured by Otto in a memorably grotesque sequence involving two chips, a pear and some tropical fish. Astoundingly, in the face of this stiff competition, Kevin Kline steals the show as psychotic, extrovert Otto, who gets many of the best lines.
Everything about A Fish Called Wanda works perfectly. As well as the four leads, the excellent guest cast includes entirely convincing turns from Maria Aitken as Archie's overbearing wife Wendy and Patricia Hayes as elderly battleaxe Mrs Coady, whose three Yorkshire terriers all meet horrific (but very funny) fates. Crichton's age doesn't appear to have affected his directing talents; he handles the blend of action and slapstick perfectly, helped by Alan Hume's cinematography. The film has a surprising number of action sequences, including the climax at the airport, which Crichton handles just as well as he does the comic character-based scenes. The heist is particularly striking, with its wonky camera angles and rapid cuts, and later, there's a brilliant sequence of Otto and Wanda having passionate sex intercut with scenes of Archie and Wendy's boring bedtime routine. The location filming works extremely well, showcasing London to good effect.
If there's one thing that dates A Fish Called Wanda (apart from Wanda's clothes), it's John Du Prez's music, which is definitely a product of the nineteen-eighties. For the most part however, the film aged well and is just as hilarious as it was in 1988.",A Fish Called Wanda
100,Rockwell_Cronenberg,One of the funniest movies ever made.,7,1 April 2012,"What is there to say about one of the funniest movies ever made? John Cleese and Charles Crichton have combined forces to create a riotously funny crime comedy about a group of criminals who are filled with bad luck and bad ideas. It takes a little long to establish the characters upon the opening, but I loved how quickly it got to the point with the robbery taking place within the first ten minutes. The laughs didn't really get started for me until twenty or thirty minutes in, but once they did they did not let up. The plot concerns four unique people who team up in England to rob some diamonds and then spend the rest of the film trying to stab each other in the back, get the loot and get away.Jamie Lee Curtis leads the foursome as the minx Wanda Gershwitz, along with Tom Georgeson's Georges Thomason. Coming in on them are the stuttering lackey Ken Pile, played by Michael Palin, and the Nietzsche-reading buffoon Otto, played by Kevin Kline. Thomason gets pinched early on, one of the first of many double-crosses, and so the film concerns itself mostly with Otto and Wanda trying to find the diamonds while making sure that Thomason stays behind bars and doesn't give them up. To do this, Wanda gets herself close to Archie Leach (John Cleese), a lawyer who has been tasked with clearing Thomason's name.A Fish Called Wanda flies around wildly, yet somehow Cleese and Crichton are able to give it this rhythm that flows so well. It never gets too far ahead of itself but it doesn't drag for a single moment either. This is the rare pure comedy that is wickedly funny while also being incredibly intelligent in it's writing and directing. A lot of comedies act as if the audience has a short attention span and so they try to cram as many jokes as possible in the first hour and then leave the audience yawning through the final act. Here though they know that the audience wants to laugh more as times goes on and they spend their time building jokes that will pay off even stronger in the later scenes.There are so many recurring bits, like Otto's blind rage over being called stupid or Ken's inability to murder an old lady, that only get more and more hilarious as they go on. Somehow these jokes never feel like they're hitting the audience over the head or being used too much, but instead just get better and better. The cast is certainly worth noting, as all four of the main characters provide great ingredients for the laughs. Cleese is the perfect straight man for the wild antics of the rest, Curtis is whip smart and an alluring sex kitten, Palin is so damn likable that you just want to make all of his bad luck go away and Kevin Kline steals the show completely.Kline takes on Otto with a skill that is almost unmatched in comedic cinema. This is a guy who is always the stupidest person in the room but always thinks that he is the smartest by far. He puts himself on a pedestal and it could have been a role that was done with disastrous results, but Kline takes his craft so seriously that Otto never feels like he's in on the joke that the audience is. This is an actor who has made a career out of mixing comedy and drama, and here is the highlight of his work in the former field. It takes a little bit to get going, but once it does this is easily one of the most delightfully hilarious films I've ever seen and Kline got me laughing harder than I have with a film in a long while. In Denmark a man died while seeing this film in theaters because he literally laughed himself to death. It's easy to see why.",A Fish Called Wanda
101,patriciogl10,One of the funniest comedy films I've ever seen.,8,26 December 2019,"One quick look at the cast and main writer and you're half guaranteed to enjoy this. The other half relies on the execution of the story. Which in this case is utterly sublime. A cast who play their roles spectacularly, to perfection. From John Cleese to Jamie Lee Curtis, to Michael Palin and of course Mr. Kevin Kline and his marvellous Oscar winning performance. Probably the funniest role anyone has ever portrayed, that won the top acting prize. His performance is so intoxicating that it almost feels odd because is not the type of role that usually gets nominated, let alone win.
Kline plays a sleazy unethical exploiter who's also rather stupid, but firm and determined in plotting his own schemes to get his whole piece of the gold.The whole film is just eccentrically hilarious, some situations are put together in an extremely witty manner that end up colliding in climatic comedy excellence. The only downside about this film is that is not as highly regarded as it should be, talk about underrated! Which is definitely not A Fish Called Wanda's fault. So I deeply encourage anyone reading this, find this film wherever you can, and just watch it and be delighted by the maximum British comedy.",A Fish Called Wanda
102,wilvram,The man who preferred Clockwise to Wanda,2,9 July 2015,"Having enjoyed Cleese's work and been a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis for years, but somehow always missed this, I was looking forward to seeing it at last. What a disappointment. Main drawback was the pathetic Palin and oafish, aggressive, Kevin Kline characters, neither of whom seemed remotely funny. I enjoyed much more Cleese's previous film, CLOCKWISE, a charming and clever comedy which survives repeated viewings, but which he considered too parochial in its appeal.Cleese seems to be obsessed by how he is perceived by Americans, perhaps because he is himself something of a self-conscious stereotype of some Americans' notion of a 'British' male - in reality, a certain type of upper middle-class Englishman. WALDORF SALAD was one of the funniest and superbly written episodes of FAWLTY TOWERS, with the clash between Basil and the brash American highlighting brilliantly Basil's snobbery, chauvinism, idleness, pomposity and incompetence, as well as the general reluctance of the native middle-class to complain, in the face of poor service and lack of value for money. In contrast, the moronic, armpit-sniffing, Kline character signified nothing, being the kind of cretin found on both sides of the pond, whom nowadays would be online, swapping uninformed, pseudonymous, abuse with each other, over the likes of socialism or gun-control. As for Palin's role, I find his notorious political namesake is usually more entertaining. The business with Patricia Hayes and the dogs is often regarded as a highpoint, but would have been scorned had Benny Hill done it. Over all, I thought this a vastly overrated and generally unlikeable film.",A Fish Called Wanda
103,Aly200,A Farcical Comedy,7,28 August 2016,"From the brilliant comedic mind of John Cleese comes this hilarious heist caper comedy about jewel thieves entangled in webs of lies, duplicity and jealousy. Boasting an excellent cast including Cleese himself as a lawyer charged with defending the heist's mastermind, Jamie Lee Curtis as the titular Wanda (displaying a fabulous mix of sexuality and controlled comedic wit), Michael Palin as the stuttering and put-upon Ken, the most impressionable gang member and rounding out the talent is the Academy Award winning performance of Kevin Kline as the brainless, hilariously egotistical and extremely jealous Otto. The cast plays beautifully off each other as they insult, compliment and weasel their ways into our funny bones.The script is side-splitting and full of memorable exchanges and one-liners (most of the memorable quips coming from Kline himself, but also from Curtis, Cleese and Palin). The humor is crisp and sharp, hitting a few missteps in the middle but quickly regains its footing. Slapstick comedy heightens the hilarity and will have you laughing so hard.",A Fish Called Wanda
104,kyle_furr,vastly overrated,5,26 March 2004,"Was this movie actually supposed to be funny? Their wasn't one funny thing in the entire movie and i don't see how anyone could actually call it a masterpiece. Everybody was just really annoying and i could barely stay awake during this movie. Was the guy with stuttering problem actually supposed to be funny? Or, how about a guy with french fries up his nose and being forced to watch a guy eat his fish? is that supposed to be funny. The plot is a bunch of crap, it has to do with a robbery and everybody begins to turn on each other right after. Kevin Kline is a hit man who reads philosophy but doesn't understand it. Jamie Lee Curtis will sleep with anyone to get the money and John Cleese is the lawyer. Don't waste your time and just watch Monty Python instead.",A Fish Called Wanda
105,antagonist117,"It takes time for ""Wanda"" to get funny, but then it gets really, really funny",7,15 January 2015,"Only the second half of this farce is funny, so is it worth enduring the leaden first half? Absolutely. There isn't a single laugh until John Cleese shows up to stay, which he doesn't really for quite a while. But once he becomes the center of the film, and once all the supporting characters' ticks have been primed for callbacks, the laughs arrive and they are persistent. A farce has to escalate, through unlikely coincidences and misunderstandings, to the point of sheer madness and then beyond. ""Wanda"" does that. By the grand finale every character is deeply enmeshed in his or her own particular neuroses and has taken them farther than seemed possible.The big one, the ripe target that Cleese must have had foremost in mind when he wrote the film, is Kevin Kline's perfect caricature—no, perfect encapsulation—of a Nietsczhe-reading, Ayn Rand-worshiping, ugly American Libertarian. His arc, which culminates in the most incredible set piece ever played out on an airport tarmac and is capped off by a wicked reference to Apartheid as the credits roll, is the most delightful takedown of that kind of person ever likely to be committed to film. He even has the douchey hat and soul patch that make up the unofficial uniform of America's most unjustifiably hubristic keyboard warriors.But Kline is not the only great element of the movie; merely the greatest. Michael Palin's dogged quest to assassinate an innocent old woman is probably one of the boldest things I've seen in a comedy, because what he murders instead is even more outside the bounds of cinematic fair play. It is the kind of thing that could lose the audience and make the movie an unpleasant experience regardless of any other consideration, and for some sensitive viewers that is probably the effect. But most will forgive it, because the utter excess of it all, and Palin's horrified reaction to his errors, turn the darkness into rich dark comedy. Palin's character has a stutter, which is another dicey area to tread, but the jokes involving his speech impediment are meant to be at the expense of others.Rounding out the cast, Jamie Lee Curtis plays a double-dealing jewel thief with a quirky fetish. Hers is probably the silliest and least funny of the movie's threads, and the awkwardness of seeing her lock lips with every character and several inanimate objects never fully wears, or pays, off. But she serves as a catalyst for Cleese's own antics, which include a Basil Fawlty-esque scenario in which, for reasons that are all quite logical, he is found dancing stark nude and speaking Russian at the top of his lungs by a proper middle-class family who looks on in horror.It takes a while for ""Wanda"" to come to that and to the other juicy bits, but they are worth the wait.",A Fish Called Wanda
106,stills-6,"I really wanted to like this movie, but...",4,18 September 1999,"I'm a big Monty Python fan, and I generally like the actors in this movie. But it left me flat. There's a few good gags, sure, and Kline is intense enough to make his character watchable, but I had a hard time finding things to like. I really wanted to like this movie because a lot of people that I know think it's a scream. I just can't see what all the fuss is about.The humor might have been better done if there wasn't so much directorial emphasis on it. Usually, the best thing about John Cleese is that his humor sneaks up on you without warning. Here, the jokes are telegraphed and the silliness seems planned. What a letdown.",A Fish Called Wanda
107,ThomasColquith,An irksome unfunny film,3,16 September 2021,"While continuing on my mission to finally watch all those films I never have, I recently watched ""A Fish Called Wanda."" I had always heard how good it was, but I had never seen it for myself these past 33 years (how time flies). And now I can honestly say that the film was not good. First of all, the film is by and large not funny. Most of the jokes revolve around hurting animals, a speech impediment, and Otto's vexing antics. The Kline character, Otto, seems to be ever-present, ruining every scene just as it's about to get good.The Cleese character, his wife, and Wanda (J. L. Curtis) are interesting but the script stops short of thoroughly exploring and expositing them. Also the possibility of any sincere romance to develop is impeded by the vexing antics. The film also never even shows the jewels being reacquired at the end, it all wraps up rapidly with little satisfaction. So in summary, not a film that I would recommend. My rating: 3/10, with the best part being Jamie Lee Curtis' ""Wanda"" vamping, playing, and confounding the men.",A Fish Called Wanda

It would be impossibly to sum up the best parts of the movie. It's a non-stop marathon of laughs that generate believably from the characters' personalities. There are also some great old-fashioned slapstick/farce scenes. It has every kind of comedy you can think of, Cleese is what I like to call a humor expert. You're cheating yourself in every way if you haven't seen this masterpiece. An astonishing, pure comedy.",A Fish Called Wanda

This was a movie that I didn't feel any interest in, until my friend said, 'Have you ever seen this movie?'... And of course we got together at the estate that he was a caretaker for and sat watching this one Saturday afternoon in 1993. I hadn't laughed so hard in a long while! For there were four, proper English folks, that banded together as a single unit, to pull off a heist and then proceed to stab each other in the back. How uncivilized! John Cleese is awesome as the quiet spirited and sentimental Barrister for the accused. The boss, that set up the ""bunch"" for the express purpose of robbing and stealing. Then there's the lovely Wanda Gershwitz,( Jamie Lee Curtis ) Along with (Michael Palin) Ken Pile and if you have ever seen this you know just who 'stole the show' Otto! Kevin Kline gives a solid gold performance as a thief off the cuff! This is one of my top-hit favorite comedies, with the likes of off-color movies like 'Used Cars' and 'Brain Donors' ""Can't Buy Me Love"" etc.This is a highly recommendable comedy favorite that any fan of any of these actors will want to see this repeatedly.

The cast really look as if they are enjoying themselves and their enthusiasm for the material carries the movie with an energy seldom seen in comedies. Kevin Kline and Michael Palin play the stand out roles, one an ignorant American thug, the other a sensitive, stuttering Brit. This is a heist movie where everything possible goes wrong, and the entertainment comes in the form of seeing the characters struggle to make the most out of the situation.

113,DanB-4,The Funniest Movie Ever Made,10,31 May 1999,"This is the only film I ever paid to see two days in a row. I missed too much of it the first time because of my own hysterical snorting laughter.This is a work of comic genius. And, like any good film, the screenplay is at the heart of the belly laughs. Every character is given a detailed personality quirk or two, and then it is shamefully exploited for laugh after laugh. Note for example, John Cleese's speech to Jamie Lee Curtis about how awful it is to be British - the eternal fear of embarrassment. Moments later, he is caught buck naked in a marital tryst in some else's flat by the people to used to live in his own home. Also, the funny-offensive envelope is pushed to the limit when K-K-K-Ken (Michael Palin), the passionate animal lover inadvertently kills three innocent dogs in his attempt to murder an old woman who would otherwise be a prosecution witness. Now that's funny!Cleese's character, Archie Leach (Carey Grant's real name) is a likable buffoon  of a lawyer, happy in his banal existence until he meets the sexy American, Wanda (Jamie Lee). I cannot even being to describe the plot beyond that point without doing it a grave disservice. It twists and dangles about in a world of double-cross and goldfish-eating for no other reason than to set up a joke.You cannot speak of this film without mention of Kevin Kline as Otto, a role that won him a richly-deserved Oscar. Otto is the ex-CIA ""weapons man"" who makes it his business to read philosophy but would be more at home with Curious George. An obsessive, self-indulgent, painfully stupid, violent, deceitful, gullible  egomaniac, the character of Otto is amongst the best comedic performances ever delivered.The film's funniest scene takes place at Leach's (Cleese) house. In a scene that rivals anything that has ever hit the screen for laughs, the film and its scripts looks deep enough into itself to even give Cleese's dry-as-toast wife a laugh or two. Then, later on, this scene proves to be the set up for even more jokes. A Fish Called Wanda is pure comedy and every scene either provides a laugh or sets one up - it graciously does not waste our time trying to be moral or turning into a formula car-chase flick.My comments are choppy but so is this movie. If you see it and don't laugh, check your pulse. We have only been given a handful of good comedies in the last decade. A Fish Called Wanda is a treasure. **** out of ****.NOTE: TBS and some other TV networks show this film with the ""offensive language"" edited out.

They're both very unique films and represent one complete story and manage at same to be devastatingly funny films. They don't need sequels because they are both 'perfect' in their own right. I have seen these films so many times but they always surprise me again and again when I find out how good they are.'The Fish Called Wanda' is not only well made but also happens to be funny. I call this movie 'the best', which may sound ironical, because Cleese and Palin have even been more funny as Pythons. Also ironical is that Jamie Lee Curtis says only one joke (Aristotle was not...) in the whole film. Kevin Kline is hysterically funny without one-liners and slap-sticks. It is the overall situation that makes the film complete. This is to say, that the film is not at all stuck up with gags but has absolutely right timing for every event. This feature makes the film even better than anything what Monty Python and the Marx Brothers have done. Or at least reaches the same level with them. This film proves that a movie can kill you in laughter using only everyday realism.A Masterpiece from John Cleese, who proves here that he can be funny even without Pythonity.

Some parts are really very good but the film also has boring patches for example woman and her dog track.

That whole apology is so hilarious ""any distress that my comments may have caused you, or your family"" :>. Palin's strutter is also very hilarious.

This one's an exception, because of lively paced direction, good writing and Kevin Klein's acting performance. the story concerns a trio of English criminals, the jewel heist and trying to later locate the stolen jewels, hidden after the theft and take care of witnesses to the crime.I saw this film when it was first released theatrically in 1988 and remembered it for being very funny. Kevin Klein won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a rare win for a comedy film. Klein plays the character with much enthusiasm, imagination, style, technique (including accents), energy and good timing. The characters and situations are well written (creative and insightful) for a comedy film. Klein's performance is classic. John Cleese wrote a large variety of jokes, delivered almost non-stop, for pretty much everything in the story.I haven't seen this film for 22 years, the longest time until I saw a favorite film a second time. The title has always stayed in my mind, because it left an impression on me. Most comedies are forgettable. The film has some interesting, diverse characters, funny dialog and has an inspired comic energy that is engaging all the way through.In a nutshell: three strong reasons to like the film: direction, screenplay and Kevin Klein's acting performance.

121,jcooloti,"It's good but I'm sorry, it's very overrated.",7,4 October 2021,"Parts of this film make me laugh out loud... hard I might add, but to be honest, it's not CLASSIC in my opinion. A lot of it makes me cringe. The soundtrack didn't age well... and I love 80s cheese-ball kinda stuff but at times one feels like they're watch Weekend at Bernie's or something... which is another 80s comedy that has some really funny parts but again, it just makes you cringe. There's something about seeing Jamie Lee Curtis (who is WAY HYPER-SEXUALIZED in this movie... to the point of absurdity) making out with the entire cast that just makes a viewer like me feel... icky. And then there is that whole dated concept that we're supposed to feel sorry for the older man (Cleese) who has lived his life with his cranky boring wife and had a dismal existence so when he falls for Wanda, we're supposed to empathize with him and feel good for him that he's in love. Well, I'm sorry, I just don't. I don't feel sorry for people like this character and I think this kind of behavior is gross... just divorce your wife and start over... don't go about like a creepy old man.Okay, okay, I know. I'm over thinking it. It's a silly comedy. Yes. But it's also trying to be romantic in parts and I just can't stand that aspect of it... it's not as cringy as Mannequin... but at times it feels like it could go there.The best parts of this movie are the silly Monty Python sketchy bits... the stutter... the killing of the little dogs... when Otto pops up between Archie and Wanda making out and says ""Don't call me stupid..."" These parts are hysterical... but you're going to have to wade through some mucky muck to get to the real laughs. The romantic element of this film is extremely dated, and honestly, in my opinion, is not executed well at all. There's also some poor direction at parts in my opinion... has this guy ever heard of a close up or an insert? Sometimes a beat of a story needs to be emphasized but it just doesn't do it for some reason...I can see how this movie was quite the riot in 1988 and seemed FRESH, but it doesn't age too well. When it comes to 80s classic comedies that have an element of romance I'd much rather prefer Mr. Mom, the Money Pit, Tootsie, Valley Girl, the Princess Bride or even.. I dunno... Moonstruck. But yes... this film does have its moments of hilarity... just not consistently. It's romantic element hinders the overall enjoyment of the film.At least for me... a 38 year old, movie obsessed, Monty Python worshipping, rock and roll loving dude with a deep appreciation for the 80s and all the amazing films and music it gave us. I'm just being honest here. I'm sure I'll probably get a million thumbs down for this but I don't care. I just don't find it to be anything near John Cleese's best work.",A Fish Called Wanda
122,varundelpiero,"Clever, laugh-out-loud, unconventional British comedy...",8,18 November 2008,"I have to admit: comedy movies are not my favourite; too many of them go through unnecessary routes to get cheap laughs, often at the expense of others. When I want comedy, I usually turn to stand-up. This is why I waited almost 20 years to see A FISH CALLED WANDA. I am not familiar with much of John Cleese's work, but after this masterpiece, I am in the process of procuring copies of the better MONTY PYTHON movies, and perhaps FAWLTY TOWERS, such was the class of comedy I experienced.A FISH CALLED WANDA proves that you don't have to sacrifice cleverness to attain good comedy, as this movie is as clever and well-constructed and thoughtful as anything I've seen in this genre. The plot takes a number of convoluted twists and turns, but none of them seem incredible or fantastic. The story itself is a captivating one involving a diamond heist and the ensuing activities of the four criminals involved.Each character brings something to the table. John Cleese is astoundingly hilarious as the barrister living a confined life. Jamie Lee Curtis enjoys one of her best ever performances as the female thief with many love-interests (and an affection for accents), and unknown desires. Michael Palin's 'mission' scenes are the ones that made me laugh aloud the most, and for prolonged periods of time. But the real star is Kevin Kline, who plays the Nietzche-reading, self-professed intellectual, in the comedic performance of a lifetime, as he steals almost every scene in which he appears. His character's contrast with Cleese's is uproariously amusing, and his 'chips' scene with Palin is simply comedic genius. His Best Supporting Actor victory was well warranted as this performance was simply unforgettable.John Cleese knows no limits, as I am well aware that he rarely (if ever) holds back when it comes to the brunt of his jokes. Whether it be the British, the Americans, intellectuals, homosexuals, the elderly, or even the stutterers, Cleese doesn't hold back. The difference here is that he does it in a clever and tactful manner, not looking merely for cheap laughs, but urging the viewer to actually THINK a bit. This, to me, is why British comedy is miles ahead of American comedy; you need a certain degree of class to pull off some kinds of jokes.Admittedly, comedy is, by its very nature, subjective. Some people don't 'get' George Carlin. Some people don't 'get' Jerry Seinfeld. Some people don't 'get' AIRPLANE. Some people actually like Bam and the JACKASS cast. All I am saying is that A FISH CALLED WANDA made me laugh aloud on a number of occasions, and for prolonged and uncontrollable periods too. And it has been a while since a comedy movie has made me do that. It was a thoroughly enjoyable Motion Picture, and even when I wasn't laughing, I had a smile on my face.For these reasons, A FISH CALLED WANDA gets 8/10 and a 4 star rating (out of 4) because I recommend this film unreservedly to anyone who has ever laughed a day in their lives. Should enter my Top 250 at around #232. Don't miss this one.",A Fish Called Wanda
123,eyesour,"Funny, I tell you. So laugh.",1,19 May 2012,"There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.",A Fish Called Wanda
124,ntvnyr30,Was Ever a Better Comedy Made?,10,13 April 2008,"This is one of those comedies that literally have you bent over in laughter. What has become of comedies? I cannot believe people find Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey funny. I just do not get these guys, their ""humor"" and the ninnies who go see their films--and I have an excellent sense of humor.I will not re-hash the plot, but like to instead delve into the interesting nuances, especially Kevin Kline's performance. Was there ever a funnier performance in all of film than Kline's moronic assassin who reads Nietzche but is a Buddhist? I love at the beginning of the film, when he declares to his accomplices ""England is a fine country!"" and then quickly degenerates as the film progresses as a Brit-loathing Yank (""...the filth of the planet!"")I've always thought that, for a serious actor like Kline, it's harder to play a comedic role than a serious one. His facial expressions are reasons enough to give him the Oscar, which he deservedly won. It was nice to see the Academy awarding a rare comedic role.There are so many funny scenes in this film, but one of the best for me was when Otto caught Archie robbing his own house, and then finally apologized to him (while Archie was unconscious, of course). Another great scene occurred when Otto was caught by Archie's wife Wendy in their house, and then tries to explain that he's in the CIA. Absolutely hilarious! Especially when Wendy, the perfectionist, uptight Brit can remember Otto's false name, Mr. Man-fred-jin-sin-jin.Michael Palin was a scream as the dog-loving thief with the worst stutter you ever heard! The scenes with Palin and Kline and between Kline and Cleese were the best in the film for me.But I suppose that without the script, none of this magic would have occurred. So I must praise the comic genius of John Cleese, whose classic ""Fawlty Towers"" is one of my favorites of all time.This is a great comedy to cheer you up when you're feeling blue, about the relationship between Yanks and our British cousins across the pond.",A Fish Called Wanda
125,Supachewy,A Very Smart Comedy That Will Keep You Entertained,7,31 October 2010,"The heist comedy A Fish Called Wanda is directed by John Cleese and Charles Crichton and stars John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline. The film takes place in modern day England.The film starts off with a four person armed bank heist. When the four of them escape the police they keep the money in a safe in a hide out. Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of their co-robbers to be able to take the money for themselves. But it turns out the money is not there. Wanda tries to gain the trust of her co-robber's attorney, Archie (Cleese), to find out where the money is. The whole film is about how Wanda and Otto try and get off with the money without being caught by the others.The screenplay was by John Cleese and it was pretty well written. There was a lot of witty dialogue and good jokes. What the script lacked really was character development, because most of the characters were one dimensional, such as Otto and pretty much Wanda even though that could be argued. There were some coincidences in the film such as towards the end involving Otto and some cement. Personally I don't find animal cruelty that funny, just cruel.The direction by Cleese and Crichton was solid. One shot in particular I liked was when Archie was hanging upside down outside the building by Otto and the camera flipped to show how he was hanging. The two of them got very good performances from the whole cast. There were really no glaring things that I was against because of the direction.The editing for this film was very smooth and flowed very well. Yet nothing made me think during the film wow, great editing choices.The acting was very good, definitely kept the strongest part of the film. Curtis was very charming as Wanda and delivered all her lines very well. It seemed that everyone gave their best acting when they were around Kevin Kline though. He deserved to get nominated but I guess it was a bad year since he won the award. He was great as the foul mouth, stupid American. John Cleese played the part of the uptight British gentleman very well also. The whole cast gave great performances.Overall I give this film a 7/10 due to the great acting. I would recommend this to anyone who likes smart comedies.",A Fish Called Wanda
126,NewInMunich,"Don't call me stupid, if i mark 10 of 10",10,5 March 2005,"My first of many times to watch it was randomly and without having any idea about it. I still have no real idea what's it about, except poking fun at English stiffs, stutterers, pet lovers, heist men, lawyers , animals and American hit men. Add to it the never seen before perversity of being hopelessly aroused prior to the real act by any vocabulary of Italian or Russian, whatever non sense it may be. And it offers a brilliantly balanced cast from K...K..K.Ken to Wanda, Otto and Archie as the quartet in search of a loot and trying to cheat each other at the blink of an eye. Something you can only pull off after years of Monthy Pythons drill or coming off strong as Kevin Kline. Watch and enjoy.",A Fish Called Wanda
127,thehappychuckler,"""Apes don't read philosophy."" ""Yes they do, Otto. They just don't understand it.""",8,7 May 2019,"A heist is pulled off by four people; Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis), her ""brother"" Otto (Kevin Kline in an Oscar-winning role), Ken Pile (Michael Palin) and Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson). Note the interesting touch of the last character name. Poor old Georges has been set up and caught by the police. Wanda and Otto can't get the goods, because Georges has them hidden. In steps the rather boring and ever-so proper Archie Leach (John Cleese) who will be Georges' barrister. Wanda then tries to work on Archie to find out info on how to get the loot. Along the way there are a number of double-crosses and scenes that can only be described as hilarious.Not one, but all four of the leads are great and bring some terrific energy to the film. Personally, I think Palin was perfectly cast as the animal and fish-loving, stuttering Ken. He almost seems to not be doing it for laughs or comic relief, he is doing it and showing how difficult it must be to be the person he is. I don't know hard to describe maybe. I do just love both Palin and Cleese, though.Screenplay by John Cleese, based on story by Cleese and Charles Crichton. In turn directed by Crichton and an uncredited Cleese. Also starring Geoffrey Palmer as the Judge and John's own daughter Cynthia Cleese as his daughter in the film Portia, which Otto wonders why they named her after a car. Great from beginning to end.",A Fish Called Wanda
128,IridescentTranquility,Brilliant all the way round,9,29 January 2006,"A Fish Called Wanda is successful to me because of the combination of different types of humour involved, from the visual to the verbal all the way to that brilliant tag line - ""A tale of murder, lust, greed, revenge and seafood"".Much of the comedy is down to the characters themselves. I think Kevin Kline as Otto is particularly good at not only physically being funny through his actions, but also through his dialogue and especially through his facial expressions (one scene with Wanda that involves him speaking a considerable amount of Italian in a very musical voice springs to mind). Otto is described as a ""psychopath"" and there is a good indication of what he might be capable of, conveyed so well through his ""Don't call me stupid"" line. We see him meditate outside Archie's house but it doesn't seem to help him manage his rage.The opening of the film made me think how well the characters are introduced, particularly in the case of Archie's wife Wendy Leach and their horrendously annoying yet also naive (in a sense) daughter Portia. It's amazing how you know you're going to dislike them within the time it takes each to finish their first sentence in the film. If Portia was my daughter, or even my sister, she would drive me mad.There are some well-constructed characters in A Fish Called Wanda. Poor Ken is a person you feel such sympathy for, especially when Otto is picking on him about his stutter, and you wonder how exactly this animal-loving man could ever bring himself to commit a crime. He is also mentally tortured beyond measure as his attempts to kill an elderly witness go terribly wrong, and he feels so guilty that the results of this clash in such an unforgiving way with his love of the animal kingdom.Wanda is particularly difficult to define. She is such a complex person, putting on so many different acts with everyone that it makes you question how she really sees things. There is a spark between her and Archie right from the start - she charms him so much that she can easily acquire far more information than she should have.As well as well-constructed characters, there are some very well crafted scene montages in the film. Their is a wonderful parallel between the way Otto and Wanda spend the night and the way Archie and Wendy sleep together - in separate beds. Otto's expressions in this sequence are - once again - priceless. A very funny moment - in terms of the way it is shot - shows Archie eating a necklace.I've always liked the music in A Fish Called Wanda. It begins the film in a way that is fluid, languid, aquatic and romantic and can just as seamlessly change to become energetic and dramatic, building up the pace so well at crucial moments.",A Fish Called Wanda
129,WendyOh!,Delightful fun.,3,22 June 2001,"I love this movie and highly recommend it. It's filled with silly Python like moments, too many to name here, but trust me this is a good one. Kevin Kline all but steals the show from a company of lunatics. Apparently some animal rights groups were upset by a certain scene involving a fish, but whatever really happened, it was worth it. John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis are terrific too, an all around good time,",A Fish Called Wanda
130,rchrdshelt,"A funny film, but disgusting and cruel in parts",9,16 September 2004,"This film is very funny and the cast is excellent along with the performances, especially Kevin Kline's. The plot is good and the amount of double-crosses makes it funny as well. Just about every character is trying to get the dosh for themselves. Although the film was funny overall, I have to say there were one or two scenes in this film which were completely unnecessary, cruel and unfunny. Dogs are killed and fish are eaten. I found these scenes sad and cruel rather than funny. I wont go into too much detail but I felt very sorry for Palins character in one or two of them and I wasn't laughing at all during them. Having said that there are several hilarious scenes and i love the way Michael Palin gets revenge at the end!Apart from those cruel scenes I loved this movie. It was funny and kept me entertained.

The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie ""Fierce Creatures"" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did).

He really deserved that Oscar! the film was delicious (and i mean it), funny, smart and charming. some people may complain that the film may be a bit vulgar in its taste but for me, you shouldn't mess with art because this film is a huge piece of art. there were some very funny scenes, especially the love-making scenes Otto and Wanda have. Otto West may be one of the funniest characters that we have seen on film. John Cleese, who played Archie Leach, wrote the film and he deserves kudos because he had a smart sense of humor of writing this film and i praise him for it. i love this film. once again, it is a very delicious movie and if you want to see a good comedy that will tickle your funny bone, this may be it for you. for me, no hesitation. you will be amazed!",A Fish Called Wanda

I sat through the first, perhaps, half-hour, upon which I turned it off to go somewhere.  I am a very firm believer in giving movies a chance.  Watch it all the way through.  I'll admit that not everything I saw in the first part was boring. Some of it was pretty funny, and I liked the plot.  I especially liked Michael Palin as K-K-K-Ken.  Anyway, when I got back to it where I left off, I was overwhelmed.  The sequence with Ken trying to kill the old lady was hilarious and Jamie Lee Curtis was very sexy.

The comic turns are done to perfection.The intense cultural divisions between the Brits and the Yanks are played out superbly.  It's pretty fast paced, but does not suffer for it as everything is just 'long-enough'.  A credit to the direction.Ken's repeated attempts to kill the old lady by means of a heart attack are some of the funniest in cinema.

The script is witty and fast-moving, the jokes hardly ever fall flat.  (Think of the scene in which Archie Leach quite literally gets caught with his pants down, or the scene in which Otto is practicing his apology to Archie... these are classic moments in modern comedy!)  Kevin Kline's fantastic performance as the dim-witted, blustering Otto (for which he got a well-deserved Oscar) is almost matched by John Cleese as Archie, the repressed barrister gradually breaking out of his shell of British propriety.  Excellent work, as well, by Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis.  True, some of the humor is overly sadistic (specifically, the abuse heaped on K-K-K-K-Ken).  It's something that I would normally consider a fault; but in this case, the movie more than makes up for it with its inventiveness and its crazy, exhilarating vitality.  ""A Fish Called Wanda"" may not have anything ""important"" to say, but if sheer hilarity and brilliant acting count for anything, it deserves 9 stars out of 10 (which is how I voted).",A Fish Called Wanda
138,keuhkokala,Overrated,6,31 December 2003,"(Contains SPOILERs for the movie and DVD)This film ought to be funny, as every critic in the world thinks it is, it has been written by John Cleese, is directed by the talented comedy director Charles Chricton and stars Cleese alongside with Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin, all of whom are great comedians. But it just isn´t. The fault is not in the actors, they all do a great job, but it´s Cleese´s script that makes this such a disappointment to me. Many scenes that other critics have praised high, such as Cleese stripping, while the family comes in are hardly funny if you have seen at least one episode of Mr. Bean before this movie. Also Kevin Kline is too good as sadistic maniac Otto. If this was a Monty Python movie, Otto would be such an outragiously exaggerated character, that it would be at least a little bit funny. But Kline acts so naturally that you just hate the guy throughout the movie. It seems to me that the whole movie is made for American audiences rather than British, as the jokes are dumber and Kline and Cleese both mock the British culture all the time. It would´ve been fun to make the both mock each other´s cultures, but Cleese´s only comeback is the comment on Americans losing the Vietnam war. Sadly, a great scene, in which Cleese complains about Rambo, American football etc. was cut and even in the Special Edition DVD it´s a hidden extra.Very little in Cleese´s script is the same comic brilliance, good timing and as funny as his material in Monty Python and Fawlty Towers (Like the Dead Parrot sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks and the Towers episode ""Germans""). There are some of those moments, however. Michael Palin´s animal-loving stutterer Ken almost saves the movie for me. The only part that made me laugh is Ken trying to murder the witness, but each time accidentally kills one of her dogs. It´s like a Road Runner cartoon came to life, when the second dog is squashed like a pancake and very, very funny. It also gave me lots of pleasure, when Palin gets his revenge in the end and drives over Otto with a steam roller. It´s Palin alone who lifts this movie´s grade by two whole numbers.6/10The best part: The actual best part was for some idiotic reason deleted from the final movie and it was another part that reminded me of those good Python and Fawlty days. The scene can be seen on the DVD in one of the documents.Cleese tries to get the stuttering Ken to tell him, where has Otto gone with the diamonds. Ken stutters too much, so Cleese can´t make anything out of his speech. ken tries to write it, the pen´s run out of ink and the pencil needs sharpening. The electric type writer hasn´t any paper, it´s no use trying to write with toothpaste on the window and so on. Finally, Palin succeeds on writing the place´s name on the wall with his own blood, with the cut he got from trying to sharpen the pencil with a pen knife.",A Fish Called Wanda
139,Dr.Mike,Great (for the 80s),8,11 January 2000,"A Fish Called Wanda is a funny British-American comedy.  It is clear that screenwriter Cleese was beginning to lose his touch for sublime comedy, but he had enough left to cobble together a fast-paced and funny film about four bungling thieves and a lawyer who somehow gets involved.  Does one ever think that maybe he wrote the entire film just to get some play with Jaime Lee Curtis?  Anyway, she is very sexy in the film and an attractive female character:  she knows just what she can use her sexuality for and does everything willfully.  She is no plaything for men.  When Cleese asks her to behave at the end of the film, you simply know that she will not.  Palin is wonderful, and of course Klein is great, although not as funny as I remember him.  I guess that his later performances have watered this one down a bit. He is talented, but somewhat repetitive.

Even little details, like Curtis with hair remover on her upper lip and her hair in curlers, make the viewer feel like they are watching from a window.  The side-splitting scenes are frequent, Cleese dancing in the nude, Kline shouting ""K-K-K-K-K-Ken is c-c-c-oming to k-k-kill me!"" left me wanting more.

I am a great lover of comedies and one of the problems with the so called ""comedies"" of today is that they try to rely on the truly sick and shocking to elicit forced, uncomfortable laughter from the audience.  This is not true of ""A Fish Called Wanda"".  This movie's most hilarious moments came from brilliant performances by all (most notably Kevin Kline in a well deserved Oscar winning role) and from John Cleese's clever script.  The chemistry between the characters was fabulous and lent its hand to a truly enjoyable finished product.  The sequence of events fell together nicely, and while there were several implausible plot turns, they did not detract from your enjoyment of the movie.  They rather enhanced the overall silliness and hilarity and ensured that you had a smile on your face when the final credits rolled.

149,sdillon-1,A superb comedy heist movie.,10,30 July 2003,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSComedy is the single hardest film genre to create classics in.  Truly great comedies are very scarce and today it is very rare to see one in the league of classics such as Kind Hearts and Coronets, Some like it hot, Dr Strangelove, Bringing up Baby, MASH, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Man with two brains or Airplane!In my opinion, the last truly great comedy made (with the possible exception of Groundhog Day) was A Fish called Wanda.  Directed by Charles Crichton (responsible for The Lavender Hill Mob  another classic), this is a superb comedy heist movie in the Ealing tradition, but with darker overtones.The plot is too intricately daft to spoil here, but suffice to say the heist goes wrong with double and triple crosses flying left right and centre before the end of reel one.  From there things build maniacally to a series of increasingly laugh out loud set pieces.  In comedy laughter settles all arguments.  As Robert McKee says, one could argue the relative merits of Citizen Kane until blue in the face, but if someone says A Fish called Wanda isn't funny and you have to pity the other person.Needless the say, the screenplay (by John Cleese) is absolutely fantastic. The cast is also uniformly superb.  Unlike his character in Clockwise where he essentially played a re-hash of Basil Fawlty, Cleese plays bravely against type as lawyer Archie Leech (apparently Cary Grant's real name). His is the most `normal' character in the film, as he finds himself seduced by beautiful jewel thief Wanda (the equally brilliant Jamie Lee Curtis). Michael Palin contributes a hysterical performance as animal loving, stuttering Ken.  However, it is Kevin Kline who really steals the show as Otto, a crazed, psychotic, insanely jealous `Buddhist Rambo'.There really are too many stand-out laughs to list here.  Think of Otto hanging Archie out of the window until he apologises.  Ken's accidental killings of small dogs as he tries to assassinate the old woman who witnessed the getaway, Otto's inept impersonations of a CIA agent to Archie's snobbish wife, and Archie frantically robbing his own house only to be ambushed by Otto who mistakes him for a genuine burglar.  And that's without even mentioning chips up the nose and the hysterical climax at Heathrow airport.If there's one thing that dates the film, it's the hilarious and at the time topical anti-apartheid touch during the epilogue: `Otto emigrated to South Africa and become Minister for Justice' but it doesn't matter.  A Fish Called Wanda has wit and sophistication to spare, something the current glut of gross-out alleged comedies have nothing of.",A Fish Called Wanda

I can't think of a single funny moment in this.Is this not a comedy? I'm not against black comedies in general but this... urgh!!! I don't even want to think about it. It just constantly made me cringe.Maybe it's just me. I could watch my science teacher dissect a heart and lungs right in front of me and I'm fine with general gore, I mean I watched that educational video on electrocution without a problem but seeing a human being empty a fish tank bit by bit in front of it's owner as a form of torture and eating each fish alive just made me feel physically sick. Maybe I 'm just pathetic but the thing is I was fine with that scene in 'Resevoir Dogs' where they cut off the policeman's ear and cover him in petrol, i love that film but maybe that was because that wasn't trying to be a comedy.I'm sorry I just can't see anything remotely funny about a man easting another mans fish as a form of torture or a woman becoming aroused by foreign language or a man who stutters or anything else that features in this movie.I don't want to think about it anymore, ever. It's not funny, it's sick.Urgh!!!",A Fish Called Wanda
154,zwrite2,Eccentric characters make this movie a joy,8,26 June 2007,"I almost always base my decision on the quality of a movie on its plot  possibly because I'm a professional writer/editor.Using my own criteria, ""A Fish Called Wanda"" shouldn't be rated a good movie. The number of plot holes is enormous and, frankly, I didn't even care who got the hidden jewels or even whether the thieves were caught and/or found guilty.However, I am giving this movie an 8. Why? In one word, ""characters."" I'm really hard-pressed to think of a movie with more eccentric characters. These characters made ""Wanda"" an enjoyable movie.I read at least a few reviews that said this movie wasn't funny. By conventional standards, it wasn't because the one-liners and comedy bits weren't particularly strong on their own. What made this movie funny was its characters, their quirky personalities, and their actions. The four primary characters were all extreme.Kevin Kline's character stood out because of his extreme stupidity, impulsiveness, pushiness, and rudeness. Michael Palin's character was extreme in his love for animals and stuttering problems. John Cleese's character was involved in an extremely repressed marriage. Jamie Lee Curtis' character was extremely seductive and had a strange passion for foreign languages.The writers did a great job of creating excellent character conflicts based on the characters' quirks. Kline ate Palin's fish. Cleese was easy prey for Curtis' come-ons. Kline's inability to grasp that girlfriend Curtis was play-acting to get the jewels led him to attack Cleese. Overlaying these individual tussles was a Brit vs. American conflict that provided lots of laughs.For those who don't know, Kline won an Oscar for his performance. In addition, I should point out that the dialogue was often very smart  particularly when the very attractive Curtis explained how stupid Kline was.I know many people objected to the killing of animals. As I sit here looking at my cute Beagle, I can honestly say that these scenes were funny. They weren't funny because dogs and fish were killed. They were funny because of how the quirky and extreme characters reacted to the deaths.I watched ""Wanda"" one more time than I usually watch a movie to make sure the plot holes I perceived weren't my own fault. I shouldn't have bothered. ""Wanda"" deserves to have a point deducted because of its plot holes. If it was a drama, these holes would have led me to give this movie a thumbs-down, but it's a comedy so I rate it as a top-notch movie.ZWrite",A Fish Called Wanda

I'll never forget watching this after my first day of high school on September 9, 1988. I was full of anticipation and the opening was quite promising with the zippy score and all. Once the loot was gone it all came to a screeching halt and became terribly tedious. If you have seen Rocky IV remember Apollo Creed coming out swinging against Drago and landing some crisp punches from the outset. He was light on his feet and full of adrenaline. There was an inkling that he just might have a chance. Well he didn't and things quickly went terribly wrong for him. As bad as that was this movie was worse after the loot was gone. The jokes became forced and none of them landed. Around the halfway mark things became desperate and the jokes got progressively more mean spirited and tasteless. Kevin Kline was absolutely obnoxious and childish. It became apparent that Jamie Lee Curtis was miscast and lacked any humor despite clearly trying hard and using all her sexuality. The scenes became more drawn out and embarrassing. I tried watching it again just recently and it was the same train wreck I remember only this time I turned it off after a half hour. There was no Drago to put the actors or the viewing audience out of their misery.",A Fish Called Wanda

Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a ""little bit"" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right.

161,laszlo-05700,Lightweight British comedy,9,9 October 2017,"The fact is, that John Cleese and Michael Palin are incredibly funny even outside their usual Monty Python stupid people roles. What they do here is something completely different. These two actors alone could make this movie work, but we also have the young and wild Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline close to his peak form. Really everything is given for a totally catastrophic movie - yet the clash of the British and American school somehow worked out brilliantly. There are no scenes that would try to give you the experience of an extremely big laugh, but it very smartly convinces you to be interested in the lead of the story and be a bit amazed about every little twist and joke. Luckily, the romantic side was not emphasized too much - it is still more of a comedy than a romantic comedy. A few theatrical motives might show up here and there, but I think that deducts little from the value of the final product - it only means that ""A Fish Called Wanda"" could work well on stage too.",A Fish Called Wanda

Especially in today's complicated political environment, A Fish Called Wanda really harkens back to simpler times!For me, this movie represents great characters, enjoyable and relatable tropes, and just no pretence or hyperbole, just straight up drama. How can you not fall in love with the major characters in this movie? They're so individually funny, nuts, awkward, hilarious.There's also a curious but perhaps very Cleesian anglophilia to the movie, a tremendous affection for England and English people, that really shines through, and a slight disdain for brash Americans, which just adds really to the movie as a whole. Just a part of what makes the film come alive, feel very real, even today.And while it's unfair to single out one single cast member's performance, Michael Palin is just so wonderful, in his short scenes in the movie. In a sweet way, he's perhaps the glue that holds the movie together, a sweet man in a movie of mostly selfish people. There's a scene with him and Cleese that's very sweet, one can really see their years of collaboration together in it! Lovely.To the 80s!",A Fish Called Wanda

I used to watch old movies from the 30's with people like Roscoe Ates (who did stuttering shtick), and I thought, ""I'm SO glad stuttering is no longer considered inherently funny.

John Cleese has written this masterpiece very cleverly, his best best writing piece since Fawlty Towers. Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar for his role in the film, is excellent as the looppy, arm pit sniffing Otto, and is my favourite in the film. Michael Palin is also brilliant as the stuttering Ken. John Cleese, in a role rather different to Basil Fawlty and his Monty Python characters, plays the lawyer Archie Leach fantastically. But the movie is all around Jamie Lee Curtis' Wanda, who is an American thief, after diamonds that she, Otto, Ken and George (Tom Georgeson) stole. In order to get the diamonds, Wanda has a fling with just about everybody. The movie will leave you in suspense wondering who will get the diamonds.

Superb!!!What a great story!I would kill to work with any of these actors/writers/directors. It makes you wonder why french fries had any other purpose!There is nothing more enjoyable than watching actors that gel when working together!!! You just know they are having fun despite long hours/political issues/producers paranoid delusions... they surpass the trite work experience and blossom into a powerful comedic steam rolling ensemble. :)In my opinion... John Cleese deserved and continues too (long past due) deserve multiple Academy awards for his numerous outstanding performances and contributions to the world and art of comedy... His dry wit and ability to nail the elusive fundamentals of comedic hooks have always been and I surmise always will be a trademark of his exhaustive talent and never ending skill at making all of us laugh.Michael Palin continues repeatedly to nail us!!! Big Surprise!!! He is the cats meow of comedy or in this case the dog stalker of drama!Jamie Lee! What a joy!! She makes the word sexy have to re-define it's own definition. She is one of the few actresses I can think of that can modify a character that doesn't have residual goo clinging from the last one that may of stero-typed her. Mind you sexy is sexy, but she always seems to bypass the chains of the last audiences memory. How does she manage it?And Kevin Kline in my opinion emerged from his cocoon on this one. Not to down play his past acting victories but it was the first film I ever saw him in where I really saw him.

I've always been sceptical of this movie, thinking that those that gave it such high praise were just reflecting from nostalgia. I just watched it, and I can safely say that it is a classic comedy. Watching this movie makes you wonder why you put up with the lame excuses for comedies that are routinely shoved into our faces.I'm starting to think that movies that do not set out to prove a point or project some societal dilemma into the minds of the viewer are the best type of movies. Because they are pure entertainment and are free in their expression.There are very few movies that I have found funnier than this one, and most of those few are just funny because they are plain stupid. This is a perfect example of how to make a comedy.It is amazing how the director not only allows us to identify with each character (and there are many!) but ""tricks"" us into empathising with and cheering on the lead characters, who are all morally bankrupt. As such, it is escapism at its finest.I'll have to watch this again, but it may just take first place over my currently favourite comedy, ""Trading Places.""",A Fish Called Wanda

181,Cpartak,One of the best (and most underrated) comedies of all time,10,8 March 2005,"Before I review this film, I want to mention that I've seen it about ten times and have yet to stop laughing at any of the jokes. This is one of the best written and acted comedies that I've ever seen. The plot is airtight, and the jokes are perfectly timed and delivered. This is due in large part to the spectacular cast of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis, Johh Cleese, Michael Palin, and my personal favorite Kevin Kline as Otto the moronic ex-CIA agent who's too stupid to realize that he's stupid. The film centers around the four aforementioned actors who are involved in a bank robbery, and the conniving and backstabbing by each that takes place afterwards. A large portion of the comedic material in this film comes from the mixture, or more precisely clash, of British and American cultures. Kevin Kline's portrayal of Otto the red-blooded American with entirely too much ego and confidence is contrasted perfectly by John Cleese's reserved and in Otto's words ""sexually repressed"" English gentleman who is too scared to go out and live his life. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as the title character who is determined to back-stab and cross anyone and everyone in order to get what she wants. Finally, there's Michael Palin as Ken the hit-man/animal lover/severe stutterer who must kill a key witness in order to protect his boss. If there are any funnier scenes than the ones where Ken must kill this witness, I haven't seen them. Palin is absolutely brilliant, easily one of the best comedic performances ever. The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does. Do yourself a favor and watch A Fish Called Wanda and you will wonder why you haven't seen (or in many cases even heard of) this film before.",A Fish Called Wanda
182,cdtidy,Lacks a necessary spark,4,28 April 2005,"In my view this film doesn't live up to its reputation. Although released in 1988, the formula behind the film is much older, and it bears a lot in common with 1960s and '70s comedies like ""Dad's Army"". It isn't the best comedy of this type and looks rather dated now, although there aren't too many topical references to the 1980s. The humour is mainly derived from the grossly exaggerated personalities of the characters, and for me this wears thin rather quickly. To me, John Cleese's English barrister is like portraying the typical American as a gun-toting, doughnut-eating 300lb redneck in a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap; it's funny for a few minutes but it isn't enough to sustain a whole movie. Having said this, the insane Otto (Kevin Kline) is a delight and adds some much-needed life to the film. But the film falls between two stools; it doesn't sport the unconstrained silliness of slapstick movies like ""Police Academy"", and neither does it feature deeper characters and a moving story like ""The Full Monty"". It just lacks the spark necessary to make a great comedy.",A Fish Called Wanda

185,max4858,My favorite movie comedy of all time,10,11 March 2021,"Reading through some of the user reviews, I am stupefied at the number of negative reviews, most claiming that the movie is not funny. What world do these people live on? I saw this movie in a theater in Tucson, AZ, when it first came out, and the entire theater laughed uproariously with my wife and me throughout the entire movie. The script by John Cleese was brilliant, setting up the characters and situations, and then coming through with some of the funniest scenes in any movie comedy ever. I hadn't laughed this much in a movie since the first time I saw Duck Soup.
John Cleese is one of the funniest film actors and, of course, he built his craft on such television classics as Monty Python's Flying Circus and Fawlty Towers. He is hilarious in this movie. Equally funny is Michael Palin, his former Python mate, and scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. I've never thought much of Jamie Lee, although she was fine in the original Halloween. But here, she is sexy, sharp, and hilarious.
Finally, a few words about Kevin Kline. At the time, Kline was mostly a serious actor in dramatic roles (Sophie's Choice, The Big Chill), but as Otto, he showed tremendous comic talent and timing. The scene in Cleese's home where he bursts in on Cleese and Curtis, only to be surprised by the return of Cleese's wife is one of the funniest scenes in film history. Kline won a Best Supporting Oscar for this film (a tremendous accomplishment since performances in comedies almost never win) and I feel it was richly deserved.
Finally, a shout-out to Charles Crichton, the director. Crichton was a regular director for the British Ealing studios and he was responsible for one of their funniest comedies, The Lavender Hill Mob. He outdid himself here and directed one of the funniest films of all time.",A Fish Called Wanda

187,blossomingartist8675,Best Comedy EVER and my favorite movie of all time.,10,19 May 2012,"What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot.The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent ""weapons man"" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is.Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis.And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of ""rubbing out"" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway).What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before.wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.",A Fish Called Wanda
188,philblyghton,Quintessential British Comedy: Cleese's individual arrival on the big screen.,10,7 January 2005,"The biggest challenge when watching this movie is to overcome the temptation to hurl as many superlatives at it as is humanly possible. This is the quintessential British comedy, superior in my view to its apparent successor 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', and a beacon of excellence in a sea of turgid, uninspired offerings from film-makers of a similar era. I have always found John Cleese to be Britain's finest comedian of the past 50 years: and while I'm enticed to use this space as a simple eulogy to his genius, it is important to note that Wanda is far from a one man show. That said, if Cleese is to be remembered for anything other than his magnum opus Fawlty Towers, Wanda would be a fitting touchstone.Director Charles Crichton (a veteran of several 1950s Ealing comedies such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob') assembled a truly fantastic cast: Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis add trans-Atlantic flair to the proceedings, with Kline particularly brilliant as the psychotic Otto, a hit-man with a penchant for seafood.... Although it's fair to say that the best lines are distributed equally among the cast, Kline bags more than an ample share, and has proved to be one of the more quotable comedic characters of recent times (""I'm, uh, Harvey. Manfred... jen... sen... den""). Jamie Lee Curtis is not quite as convincing as the conniving Wanda, yet more than holds her own while her colleagues produce their finest work (indeed, Kline was awarded an Oscar for his performance). There is excellent support from British actors Maria Aitkin and Tom Georgeson, and of course the wonderful Michael Palin as stuttering Ken, the animal lover.The writing from Cleese is often unnervingly sharp: every single sentence seems to be laced with aesthetic value, and this is a fine achievement considering the film runs for nearly two hours. The farcical scenes (such as Cleese's attempt to hide his affair with Wanda from his wife) are achingly funny, exploiting both Cleese's inimitable brand of physical humour and the frequent juxtapositioning of the attitudes of British and American people towards romance, sex and relationships at large.I love the film. As an ardent 'Towers' fan, this humour is tailor-made for my tastes. While the plot is sometimes a little TOO convoluted for perhaps its own good (a little bit of indulgence from Cleese no doubt), this is still film-making of the highest calibre and remains my favourite comedy to date. Very Highly Recommended 9.5/10",A Fish Called Wanda
189,Rednellop,not as good as i thought,5,27 July 1999,this film ain't what i was waiting for. I heard a lot of good things about the movie. That it was one of the funniest movies of all time but it's not that funny. I rented and i thought i would never stop laughing. But i have maybe laughed twice and that's it. But i must say kevin kline's performance is very good.,A Fish Called Wanda
190,diegofeduchi,A top comedy,9,28 February 2007,"John Cleese has to be my favourite Python. He is a good actor, almost a certainty when you talk British actors, and funny in all the best ways. You can be funny in a silly way or you can be a great comedian, as John Cleese is. He perfectly plays an old-fashioned English barrister, being his formal life a joke itself.Michael Palin is Cleese's partner-in-crime in the Pythons. He plays a funny role, as his character is the last thing you'd point as a delinquent. His struggle with his stud adds to the fun, but again, not in a cheap way.His nemesis is played by Kevin Kline. His s the case of those actors that have a different personality with a moustache (here) or without (Cry Freedom). He plays Otto, who hates being called stupid.Jamie Lee Curtis, at her best, plays the girl of the film. She is a bit of a teaser in pursuit if her own ambitions. Along Kline, Palin and Tom Georgeson (called in the film George Thomason)form the criminal gang.Without giving away any of the plot, and though probably most people has already seen it, I can say there's a robbery. To cover the crime, the gang try all sorts to divert the evidence and create several minutes of laughter.I must have seen this film over 10 times, and I enjoy every time. It was such a success the 4 main actors tried to recreate the chemistry in this masterpiece in 'Fearce Creatures', but this didn't work.",A Fish Called Wanda
191,tlcookie13,Slapped with a dead fish,3,10 January 2010,"First I have to say, I don't think I'm a huge fan of slapstick comedy to begin with. This movie really shoves it down your throat, though.One positive about the movie, I was pretty impressed with how in shape John Cleese is. I had no idea he ever had a six-pack. A pat on the back for you sir.The movie is about four people teaming up to commit armed robbery, only to plan on double-crossing each other afterwards. All the actors in the film do a great job portraying their individual characters; I will give them that. Especially Jamie Lee Curtis, her interpretation was flawless. Kevin Kline, whom I normally love, however, had a character that made me want to stab a fork in my eye. His acting chops are undeniable, but I don't think it could've been possible for him to be more irritatingly annoying. Michael Palin's character comes in second place for being a bothersome aggravation. His stutter made me want to reach in the screen and slap him across the face. I was happy with how the movie ended, minus the stories of where the characters are now. I don't know what lamebrained numbskull came up with them, but the over attempt at humor failed me by a long shot. I can now cross this movie off my list of movies to see, but I will certainly not be watching it again.",A Fish Called Wanda
192,davidhale,The best British film of all time!.,10,24 July 2008,"If I have one thing to thank America for it is for part funding ""A Fish Called Wanda"". It is the best comedy of all time. From Micheal Pallins stuttering -Ken, to Jamie Lees - Wanda performance it is simply outstanding. Based on a heist of a top London Bank the film then tells the story of the cover up and back stabbing that follows. Many believe Kevin Kline deserved the Oscar he received for his role of Otto the ""Dont call me stupid"" X-Cia agent and he did but John Cleese more so. His character Archie Leech is the funniest person ever on film, from the original heist to the shock when he beds Jamie Lee he does it all in the best of British Humour.If you have never seen this film I advise you to as you will be in fits of laughter and if you are not...get help! Nothing like you've ever seen before and the best British Film of all time.",A Fish Called Wanda
193,Xandrule,"Funny, funny, funny!",9,24 January 2015,"This 1988-flick comes to its viewers with a lot of exciting, well acted and hilarious play. It definitely is one of the greatest comedies ever made and certainly one of the best casted movies ever. What ever scene you switch to, you see a very well done acting, perfect writing and - as mentioned in the headline - fun, fun, fun!Director Charles Chrichton has done a tremendous (final) job with this. One of the greatest comedians ever, John Cleese, starring as Archie Leach, has not only done an usual super job by his acting but also by his writing - Cleese as we know him, as we love him. But there's no space for weak play to see throughout the film: Michael Palin as Ken Pile, a stutterer, for whom he used his real life experience since his father was a stutterer as well; Kevin Kline starring as Otto maybe in his best movie he ever played in and not to forget - Jamie-Lee Curtis starring one the most charming and most beautiful woman you can imagine, Wanda Gershwitz. Last but not least we see Tom Georgeson starring Georges Thomason (no joke!), wherein he shouldn't had much of a problem in playing this character in my humble opinion.As mentioned above, in this movie there's a thick line of pure fun drawn from the very beginning to the very end. Whatever I can describe here, you better watch - and laugh - it yourself. Anyways I would never spoil my readers by making them laugh before they watched the movie. Let me just mention, that one men in Denmark literally died (heart-attack) by laughing too much when watching this movie!The plot is explained easily: four robbers, Wanda, Otto, Ken and Georges,do what robbers usually do - they rob a bank. The prey, a few quite big diamonds, is stored in a garage but George decides to store them somewhere else after everybody has left the garage. In the same time,Wanda and Otto, who are together, betray George, who thinks, he is together with Wanda on the other hand, by calling the police to a place he should meet up with Wanda. George goes to jail and Wanda and Otto find out, that the prey is gone. So they try their best to get back the diamonds. And that's where Wanda reveals all her weapons as a woman by hitting on George's lawyer, Archie. In plus there's Ken, which will be seduced too by Wanda to give out some useful info to her. Wanda actually keeps a tight rein on all her men around. It might be OK to mention, that she kisses all men at a certain time in the movie. In the end we have a puree of intrigues, lies, seductions, desires and tactics based on... fun!The writing of John Cleese is outstanding. Every line stands for it's own and obviously it was extra written to complete exactly this scene of the film. Nothing seems insincere or anywhere plastic. Especially since the way of acting of all the actors is perfectly done. This combination is nothing more and nothing less then just super to watch. As a viewer you never feel left alone since the pictures you witness to see are always touching you in a certain way - whatever your age might be, from 8 to 88.It would be understated to just ""highly recommend"" this movie. It literally is a must-see - in a way that everybody who claims he even likes movies, has to see this flick! You won't regret any second of it.",A Fish Called Wanda
194,Mitchel-331-787651,Laughing Just Thinking About the Movie,10,23 April 2012,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I remember seeing this in the theater and having to go back and see it again because I missed so much of the dialogue while laughing hysterically at points. My stomach was in stitches and after a while it even started to hurt from laughing so much!A Fish Called Wanda never lets up! Whoever thought of this one made pure comic genius come to life on the screen. I've seen some funny movies in my time but this one here takes the prize! Each and every character was hilarious. I don't know who I liked better...John Cleese, Kevin Kline or Michael Palin but anytime either of them come on the screen be prepared to lose it. Be on the look out for Kevin Kline when he tries to come up with a name, for John Cleese's wife, as well as Michael Palin's ""particular"" trouble when being questioned by John Cleese towards the end! You'll know exactly what I am referring about when you see it--talking about losing your mind with laughter!There are truly so many moments of pure funniness that it doesn't even make sense to try and review this movie because I won't be able to do it justice...but here is a snippet of what to expect. A gang of thieves commit a robbery, then try to double cross one another for the loot. There is a key which opens the lock to the stolen treasure which only one of them knows the location of and its the finding of where the key is hidden by the others that starts all the fun! Forget the fact that you don't know me, just trust me on this one....A Fish Called Wanda makes for a hilarious time no matter who you be or where you come from. However, I will issue this one serious warning: Do not try to eat or drink anything while watching this movie because you are quite capable of choking to death from laughter!",A Fish Called Wanda

Michael Palin They are excellent together with a lot of fun and excellent comedy for all the family. They cooperated in at least three movies that I'm aware of and all are very good. It is a pity they don't have anymore comedies together. In their last movie ""Fierce creatures"" they even laughed at the end of the movie about themselves. John Cleese remarks towards Jamie Lee Curtis ""Wanda"" like by mistake. In fact, it refers to their first movie together and that seems to be an unofficial good by remark. I do hope they will return with another director. Go and see them all.",A Fish Called Wanda

198,Maverick131,Intelligent comedy,8,28 December 2001,"This film will make you laugh.  If you watch it and like it, then you'll watch it over and over again, each time discovering more and more subtle tid-bits.  John Cleese oozes sophistication (as well as pretension) as the typical English barrister.  As usual, his humor is dry and his comedic timing is perfect.  He makes up 35% of this film's quality by himself.Kevin Kline's character Otto is essentially a buffoon who doesn't realize he's being manipulated by everyone else in the story.  His refined egotism is in spite of his oblivion to this, and he makes up another 35% of the quality by himself.  I haven't seen a better performance than this by Kevin Kline.The other players in this film, while very good, all take a backseat to John Cleese and Kevin Kline.  If you haven't seen it, by all means, rent it and watch it - you won't be disappointed!",A Fish Called Wanda
199,Domi-10,"splendid, outstanding old chap",8,19 November 1999,"Now here is a movie one should have seen. It's simply great. It is obvious that you can leave it up to Cleese to write a comedy, in style of Fawlty Towers and a glimp of Monty Python. I think that Ken could not have been played by any other man than Palin. It's as if his stuttering and yet expertise in robberies are like second nature. All characters in th emovie have a sort of natural thing about them. the way they meet and their behaviour. I must admit that this was the first movie I saw with Jamie Lee after Halloween and I could not believe it, she had grown, and she played her part so well, the sexy girl with a brain, ofcourse only for selfimprovement. And Kline is at his best as the, don't call me stupid, brother (?). I love it how he tries to keep Wanda for himself while she is trying to get rid of everyone. Anyway this movie is one of the greatest comedies ever written, as I mentioned before comparible with Mont Python and Maybe, but that's totally my opinion, Wayne's World.

For example Archie's wife's character is crucial, even though she is only peripheral.I've watched this many times, and look forward to favorite bits; I never like it any less.

It is drop-dead hilarious! Palin, along with fellow Python John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline form the core of what is indeed one of the greatest comedy movies I've ever seen! Each of the main characters possesses a truly unique personality and distinctive trait, from poor K--K--K--Ken's stuttering to Otto's (Kline) brutishness to Wanda's (Curtis) ability to seduce people like Archie (Cleese).

It was one of the only movies that I truly thought about walking out on before it was over.  I love good comedies.  This was not one of them.  I don't know what it is about this movie that bothers me, exactly.  It could be the cast, which I think is very strange and not especially appealing.  I really think that it was just written as a plot that would allow a string of unconnected, ""funny"" scenes to be shown in one film.   I didn't care one iota about a single character or the outcome of the film.  I've seen it a couple of more times on TV, hoping to understand what everyone finds so funny but it still escapes me.

Jamie Lee Curtis is hilariously manipulative, John Cleese is darling and heartwarming, and Michael Palin is over-the-top funny (if not politically correct) with his stuttering K-k-k-Ken character.

From the moment it starts until the instant it ends, you are rivoted to your seat. There are twists and turns and something hilarious happening every moment. This story never lagged or spiraled off somewhere into the unknown. It stayed on track full speed ahead with twists and turns at every bend. Every actor played the part so briliantly that you actually believe these are real people, from the psychotically deranged Otto to the stiff upper crest wife and equally snobbish daughter. My favorite character was Otto. This man thinks himself educatedabout  human nature but completely mis understands the concepts. He really does have ""no clue""! just as Wanda pointed out, apes CAN read, they just don't understand it. That's Otto!

Every hilarious moment makes sense; every set piece is properly motivated; and the story works as a comedy, a caper, and a satire of both Brits and Americans.But as good as the script is, the cast is even better with each actor diving into their role. Kevin Kline's Otto is wonderfully quirky and rage filled by turns; Michael Palin proves that broad comedy can be nuanced; John Clease provides a surprising emotional anchor with a vulnerable performance; but it's Jamie Lee Curtis that stands out with a hard charging, galvanizing, and sexy presence that she specialized in.
