0,SnoopyStyle,indie horror,6,13 January 2021,"Charlie (Dan Stevens), his girlfriend Michelle (Alison Brie), his volatile younger brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh's girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand) have rented an ocean-side house for vacation. The owner Taylor (Toby Huss) may be a racist. When Josh's dog goes missing, he suspects Taylor. A camera is discovered in the shower. It culminates in a violent confrontation.This is an indie horror directed by Dave Franco. The story is fine for a striped down horror. I would let Josh kill the man rather than engineer the death. It's meant to alleviate the guilt from him when that's not really necessary. Nobody likes him in the first place. It works a lot better if the extra element is kept off screen for awhile longer. Let the four characters cook in their own juices. The bubbling relationship between these four is the best aspect of this movie.The movie's main difficulty lies in its director. Franco lacks the specific horror action skills. Non of the kills are exciting. The horror could be much scarier. Running at the car window is probably the only good horror shot and that scene is cut short. The body on the cliff would be terrific visual if Franco could incorporate more vertigo into the shots. If you're crashing a car anyways, let's flip it for more exciting crash action. Franco doesn't have the required skills to elevate the horror thriller aspect.",The Rental
1,nogodnomasters,What is that?,2,1 August 2020,Two couples who work together rent an expensive house on the coast. The landlord in a bit creepy and the angles we see indicate voyeurism. There is some cheating going on too.The couples were not that exciting. This is similar to other films with a slight twist on the end. The film is boring up until the last few minutes when the action happens but by then I was too far out of the film.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.,The Rental
2,kosmasp,Piece of tranquility or not,7,19 November 2021,"Obviously if you rent a place, the person(s) you rent from do not know you and you don't know them (is there a singular for that? It's not the easiest including every possibility, but you catch the drift). The movie overall sets quite the interesting tone and it has really intriguing themes.One major letdown is one of the main characters. Very unlikeable she is - which really brings down many things she fights for or rather against, that may ring true in the overall sense. There are more than a few twists along the way, the not so good behavior of our renters may not count as one of them. Especially the ... let's call it relationships amongst them.It's a bit cliche and while it is not exploited in the fullest, it may raise questions on other things that would count as twists along the way ... as in mere coincidence or planned? Throwing in a twist to get a reaction from the viewer is one thing (and I suppose it does work on some), but veteran viewers will likely see through many things - not to mention the ending.Now while I assume some may call it weak, I would not ... well I would put it a different way. Because the overall suggestion of the ending (and the ending after that, there are parts of it in the credits) is quite interesting - and may work with some of the viewers. But again, I would call it a missed opportunity, because there is so little to care about all the way up to that moment, that it is something that I am tempted to call wasted opportunity.Still a decent movie/thriller/horror - tense from start to finish (even as I said if it is for wrong reasons at times) - this is entertaining and the actors do their best to say the least. Oh and beautiful location.",The Rental
3,Sleepin_Dragon,Better than expected.,7,12 February 2021,"I liked this, having found many horrors in the slasher/mystery genre pretty disappointing in recent times, this was pretty decent. It's definitely flawed, so don't expect masses of tension, or any scares, but overall, it's solid.The one criticism I'd have, is that it's so slow to open up, that's the major issue with this film, you're waiting for an hour for the fun to start. The last half hour of the film is the best part, it is really good, and surprising.There are a few twists, and it does a god job at misdirecting you, a second would definitely work.I have to say though, Dan Stevens, is this really what you're going to be doing from now on in? You're better than this.Check out the actor under that mask, Anthony Molinari, a shame that face was hidden away for so long.If you enjoyed The Strangers, I think you may enjoy this.Pretty good overall, 7/10.",The Rental

5,CinemaSerf,"Hi-tech, low-spec murder thriller...",6,26 February 2021,"So two, ostensibly happy, couples head to a beach-side property for the weekend. Once there, though, they start to get the feeling that they are being watched (and not just by us)! It gradually emerges that these people have plenty of baggage and, eventually - after subjecting us to most of their dirty washing, they start getting bumped off... Who's doing it and why? Well we have our suspicions but don't expect much by way of a conclusion, you might just be frustrated! Enigmatic, lazy, both? To be honest, by the time we entered the denouement phase, I really couldn't have cared less. Director Dave Franco is a competent actor, but in this - his directorial debut - he overly relies on creating a sense of prurient menace (using hidden cameras and the like) as well as the use of pretty things to look at: glorious ocean scenery, sunsets, Dan Stevens (""Charlie"") and his own wife Alison Brie (""Michelle""). The writing is little better than establishing fodder for the last twenty minutes of slasher horror that I felt was pretty much well deserved on all, and ought to have started much earlier in the film's creative process (though perhaps just a shredder rather than a claw hammer?). Dan Stevens is a great looking man - those smiling, expressive, eyes work well in these slightly cooky dramas he has a habit of undertaking, but here even they cannot compensate for his own mediocre performance, and for those of an especially average Jeremy Allen White (""Josh"") and Sheila Vand who really didn't seem to care any more than I did. Debut's are rarely world class, so maybe we ought to cut this some slack, but as there's already more than enough of that in the plot - perhaps we had just best hope the last few minutes don't serve to provide us with a ""Rental II - Revenge of the Viewer""",The Rental
6,george.schmidt,Familiar yet receptive.,7,2 September 2020,"THE RENTAL (2020) *** Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Sheila Vand, Jeremy Allen White, Toby Huss, Anthony Molinari. Actor Dave Franco makes a fine directorial debut (and co-wrote the screenplay with fellow filmmaker Joe Swanberg and Mike Demski) in this horror film about two young couples on a weekend vacation for a celebration that eventually downward spirals when they learn their rental is being spied upon.

I don't what they expect from a horror thriller like The Rental. I thought that for this genre it was a pretty decent movie. It won't win prizes or so but it's certainly entertaining. There is some good tension building and the acting wasn't bad either. I only know Jeremy Allen White from the excellent series Shameless, the rest of the cast was unknown to me but they all did a decent job. As for the horror it's mild but yet effective. All in all it wasn't a bad movie, certainly better than I expected for a movie in this genre.",The Rental

11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Air bye n' bye.,6,4 February 2021,"For the most part, 'The Rental (2020)' plays out like a straight drama. It follows four friends who rent out a luxury beach-side home for a celebratory vacation, only to discover that their private getaway might not be as private as they first thought. There's a lot of foreshadowing throughout the piece but there's very little dread. It doesn't feel like a horror at all, really; it's a thriller at a push. Even then, 'thriller' is probably too generous a label for it. That is until its final act, which suddenly shifts gears into full-blown survival horror territory. However, this last movement isn't quite as successful as what precedes it. It actually undermines a lot of the overall narrative and is rather underwhelming, despite being generally well-achieved and, even, tense. Its major problem is a specific, almost random element which I won't spoil here. All I'll say is that it's too generic for its own good. In fact, I think the narrative would be much more interesting without it. A few tweaks to its last moments could have transformed this uneven, for lack of a better term, 'wannabe horror' into a compelling dark drama. Of course, that's pure speculation. The film as is isn't bad, either. It has a few clunky lines of dialogue, but it's typically an engaging and enjoyable experience. It has some solid cinematography - except when it overdoes its fake fog - and its performances are great, too. It's an entertaining, if flawed, affair. 6/10",The Rental

Usual cliff by the ocean for you know what. Not believable were the unlikely technical use of cameras; the lack of disappearance investigation. Usual poor decisions.

Set up was not original, but I bought it - i was into. But its the third act that kinda felt off for me.

15,cruise01,Slow building suspense thriller that has a similarity to Vacancy.,7,2 December 2020,3.5 out of 5 stars.The Rental is a pretty fair horror film about four friends who rent a beach house for the weekend. Only to discover they are being watched through hidden cameras in the house.The plot has some similarities to Vacancy film. But with two couples renting a house for the weekend. Only to be stalked by a creeper.The film does have a slow building suspense build up. Charlie (Dan Stevens) and his wife Michelle (Allison Brie) going with his brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White) and his girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand). While the film does build some tension between Charlie and Mina. As they work together. And there is some tension like an affair. Or Mina feeling discriminated as her renting application got denied while Charlie easily got accepted.The cast did a good job with there performances. The music score also helped with the unsettling tone. Things do escalate in the last half hour when the characters are being stalked by a mysterious person. It may not be as scary or thrilling. It does have some suspense.,The Rental

19,jtindahouse,Hard to believe a film this good was a debut effort from Franco,9,26 July 2020,"While watching 'The Rental' I kept wondering to myself who the director was, because the film was made with a lot of class clearly. Then the credits rolled and I saw Dave Franco's name appear and I thought it must have been a mistake. I knew he was married to the film's star Alison Brie, but I also knew that he had never directed anything before, let alone a film this good. This is an incredible debut from him, and not only did he direct it but he wrote it too. Anyone who can breathe fresh life into a genre as tired as the horror one is deserves a lot of credit. Perhaps his future is held behind the camera rather than in front of it.The film blew me away by how patient it was. It only runs for 88 minutes, yet it was so happy to slowly set the story up, all the while only giving us small hints as to what the actual danger was to these characters. There is a cheap jump-scare or two early on that the film could have done without, but otherwise the first half of this film is extremely well done in the sense that we know there is danger, but we don't know who, how or what. It adds a mysterious element to the film that I absolutely loved.Then the final act kicks into gear and the film goes into overdrive. Very rarely anymore is a film able to raise my heart-rate or get me on the edge of my seat, but 'The Rental' did both. The scare sequences aren't conventional and I think that's why they worked. It was impossible to predict exactly what was coming next. I had a terrific time with this film and would highly recommend people give it a watch.",The Rental

28,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Rental,6,14 December 2020,"""It can never happen again"". Yeah but it surely did. I ""rented"" The Rental. It's a nether thriller by James Franco's brother Dave and yeah, I never knew the dude was even a director. Not great but not too bad for his first go-around.Anyhow, 2020's ""Rental"" is my latest review. It was released in July of this year and was shot in the lush cities of Bandon and Portland, Oregon. In truth, Dave Franco knows where to put the camera in regards to The Rental. He creates a flick that is somewhat Hitchcockian, somewhat Brian De Palma, cloaked in frankness, and darkly atmospheric in its tack.Watching ""Rental"", you might think twice about spending time in a seaside home for a weekend. That's especially if someone is secretly filming you making dampened whoopee in a shower (yikes).Starring Jeremy Allen White from Showtime's Shameless, featuring a disarming closing credits hook, and running a slight eighty-eight minutes, The Rental possesses two unlikable characters that are nonchalant about the concept of infidelity. One of said characters is even cheating on his wife with his brother's would-be girlfriend. Talk about cutting it close (ha-ha).So yeah, ""Rental"" is all about sardonic friction from the word go. The problem is that its antagonist is unknown, speechless, robotic, and without any clear motive. Who is this Mr. Clean-style killer? What is his stone-faced deal? And why does he feel the need to off some la-di-da millennials along with his D-bag associate?The Rental chronicles two couples who rent a home and are terrorized by a veritable, invasion of privacy wacko. This wacko also runs like a deer and seems palled on because he doesn't have anything else to do. Me, well if I'm in the lurch I write reviews just like this mixed one.

It could of been better if it didn't go down the horror route and was just a drama. The story itself was inconsistent. Why didn't the property owners brother notice the pick up truck in the drive whilst he was waiting for the couples? What happened to the woman off the cliff? What was the locked door under the house about?
It leaves many questions to answer but overall it was a better than average film and a sequel to answer these questions would be good.",The Rental
30,arungeorge13,A neat little thriller that settles for a serviceable climax! [+60%],6,25 July 2020,"To start off, I liked quite a few things about The Rental, Dave Franco's directorial debut. While it deals with the concepts of racial discrimination and voyeurism that have been handled better in other films, The Rental adds a layer of sophisticated relationship chemistry between the four protagonists. They're flawed and vulnerable the way all young people are. While they display composure at first, when the situation starts to turn on them, they lose their cool and start making naive decisions. This complexity being explored to a great extent is what made me like The Rental.The performances are good across the board - Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Sheila Vand, and Jeremy Allen White - all of them did a neat job with their respective roles. The beautiful hilltop house (with splendid views of the ocean), the foggy night atmosphere, the tension-inducing background score, and the overall restlessness of the screenplay certainly work in the film's favor. From the 30-minute mark, it's mostly an intense, thrill-filled ride all the way. Except for the rather bland climax, I suppose. I really wish there was more to the bad guy and his motive. The Rental may not be the best voyeur thriller out there, but it does make you rethink staying in countryside BnBs or at least, just be a little more careful in that regard.",The Rental
31,gedikreverdi,That's amazing. I need a sequel to this!,9,14 January 2021,"The two couples rent a beatiful secluded house overlooking the Pacific Ocean by the cliffs. Mina and Charlie are work partners and Charlie and josh are bothers. Michelle and Charlie are married and Mina and josh are dating. Mina and Charlie are close in an awkward way and Michelle thinks it's fine. On the first night everyone except for Michele took drug and had fun. When josh fell asleep, Charlie and Mina got into the bathtub and kissed and then made love in the shower later on. In the morning, Mina and Charlie were wasted so that's why josh and Michelle went on an excursion in the forest by themselves. Back at the house at the shower Mina noticed there are cameras all over the place and they said they'd not go to the police because there's their secret in the footage as well. So they kept quiet. The two came back and the dog was missing. This time Michelle by herself took drugs and wanted to use the hottub but it'd not work so she called the racist house owner guy (he was being racist towards Mina). The other 2 was annoyed wth this bus the guy came over and solved the problem for Michelle. Then while they're looking for the dog josh asked him if he took the dog but he said no. And Mina at the bathroom said to him that he shouldn't share the footage with anyone but the guy seemed clueless and they confronted. When josh heard them fighting, he came and beat the guy in the tub. When they were confronting in the living room, the masked guy came and killed the guy who had just fainted. When they came back they thought josh killed her. Michelle disagreed with the idea of covering the murder because they'd all be accomplice to murder but they dumped the body from the cliffs. He didn't react the bottom and they threw stones to move his body but didn't work. And josh descended to the point where he landed and pushed him to the sea from the cliffs. Back at the house Michelle watched the footage in the house in the loft. She got furious and took the car to leave by herself. Charlie lied to the other two that she wanted to leave because of the murder. The masked killer put a trap in the road and she had a flat tire and stopped and freaked out and locked herself in the car texting her husband but the killer attacked her. Charlie came to her help but the killer killed him too in the woods. The other two managed to get into the room behind the digitally locked door but there was nothing. Josh received the footage from Charlie's phone and got mad looking for Charlie at home and the killer attacked him from behind a closed door. Mina ran upstairs and made him think she jumped dropping one of her shoe and hid in the room. The killer chased her in the forest till she fell off the cliffs because there was heavy fog at night. It turned out he rents the houses like this and put cameras and stuff everywhere and hunt down the rental guests. The mask was really good and I didn't expect to watch a very good slasher. The tension and the back story and the acting were great. I'd like to watch a sequel to this.",The Rental

33,maurice_yacowar,Idyllic getaway results in shattered civilization,7,13 May 2021,"Actor Dave Franco's debut as writer/director is an impressive expression of these times.Spoiler alert: If you haven't seen this film don't read on.Like the classic whodunit, the horror mystery is usually a whosdoingit. That is, we play Guess the Killer from the array of Usual Suspects. Also, there is also usually a survivor, or two, you know, to encourage our spirit to Carry On. We want to feel scared not hopeless.Not here. Both couples are killed off, as is the only other speaking role in the main body. And the killer, once exposed, is unnamed, faceless, unknown beyond his role as high-tech voyeur and slaughterer.The two central couples are polished, attractive identification figures for us. Charlie and his brother Josh's girlfriend Mina are bright successful designers of something, celebrating a big contract. Hence their weekend getaway to a posh private rental.Josh is a troubled soul, a college drop-out with an assault record, who ""hit the jackpot"" in winning Mina. As Charlie's lover Michelle thinks she did, until the drugs and booze shatter the relationships. The accomplished characters exemplify the civilization here at risk. With every advantage the two couples are helpless under this attack.In making Mina an ethnic minority sensitive to discrimination, the drama expands its sense of currency. Estate manager Taylor is a racist, sexist, sinister working man, clearly the Professional Class's nightmare. That is, the central cast embodies the current division in America, where the economic and cultural gap has led to an unbridgeable divide.This chasm is set against the opulence of the holiday retreats. Expensive rentals in the glorious wild, who could ask for anything more? But every Eden has its serpent. This idyll is shattered by an inescapable evil.More to the point: that evil is Unknown. It's a force beyond the antagonistic social camps represented by the first five characters we meet. Also, while its savagery is as basic as a hammer it has a remarkable technical savvy, as the villain reveals when he continues to rent a place, install his voyeuristic technology and proceed to kill on. He has the ""motiveless malignity"" Coleridge attributed to Iago, but with enviable electronic savvy.That's the point of the film.

The couples go on vacation at a home stay but, not everything is as idyllic as it seems.The Rental is a mind-blowing film. Dave Franco knocks it out of the park, in his directorial debut. Be patient with this film. You may think that it is slightly dragging, in the beginning. However, the pulse-pounding, edge of the seat climactic set piece, more than makes up for the slower pace during the early scenes of the film. There are jump scares aplenty. The performances help elevate the film & make you care about the characters. Dan Stevens is superb as Charlie. Alison Brie is spectacular as Michelle. Sheila Vand is outstanding as Mina. Jeremy Allen White is fantastic as Josh. Toby Huss is unforgettable as Taylor. The Rental is a must watch for horror/thriller fans. Go & get thoroughly spooked this Halloween season!",The Rental

38,kuarinofu,I re-evaluated this movie at the time I was writing this review,7,31 July 2020,"While this film made my brain hurt a couple of times because of how unrealistic and stupid the characters were, I reassessed my thoughts on this one when I was writing this.The film gets much better if you finish it, even though it is incredibly painful to watch so much stupidity at times. Many things in this make no sense but I don't want to get into spoilers. The weirdest thing, probably, was the awkward racism and misogyny commentaries, these felt really out of place.Why I gave this 7 instead of a 4 or 5 is because I'm almost sure that due to the way the ending was shot, this film is not a case of the creators messing up, this was quite intentional and was made in this specific way to emphasize certain key points.I can't say this though about the whole film, since it is very inconsistent and barely believable at times, but the core idea, again, if intentional, is worth it. I can't really discuss it without diving into spoilers, but I loved the vibe that makes you feel like you're watching a crime mystery documentary. I love how methodical and cold it got in the end (powered by a great soundtrack). I really hope that the message I got from this film was the one the creators wanted me to understand.Thus, in my head, this film came all the way from garbage to an interesting experience.P.S. The poster seriously misrepresents this film, it looks like the film is about aliens or something.",The Rental

43,apryla-58795,I rather liked it BUT...,7,13 February 2021,"I am really into horror movies and I don't mind slow burn films which this movie def is. It's not scary but it is horrific because the point of the film is to show that there are random killers out there and we don't know who they are or what their motivation is. A lot of reviewers had a problem with that but I didn't.Here's what I had a problem with...why was the locked room under the house not explained especially since such a big deal was made of it. That seemingly was leading us to believe it factored into the story line significantly but in the end it didn't even need to be in the movie.The other issue is...so after this guy kills all these renters they aren't gonna figure out it was him?! He wasn't masked when he met with the agent so how to explain that? That should've been explained better.Also I haven't really seen DS in anything that I liked but I didn't mind him in this. I didn't like SV and I didn't buy that JAW would be with her. They had zero chemistry.Lastly I've always found Alison Brie annoying. She reminds me of that busybody nobody liked in high school who has somehow duped Hollywood into thinking she's attractive and a good actress. She looks like she should be living in a middle class development being the win at all costs mom of one daughter who competes in pageants who then eventually kills her husband through rat poisoning because he doesn't share the same vision as her. She's pulled off the ultimate con in duping Hollywood to continually cast her.I don't think Dave Franco did a bad job with this at all. I've seen a lot of movies and I didn't hate this one. I removed three stars due to AB, SV the fact that the locked door was unnecessary and went nowhere AND because what happened to the brother who owned the original AirBnB?! Did the mask killer off him too?Oh and I almost forgot...how did the masked killer get to be in the woods when AB and JAW went on their hike? They clearly said it was two hours away so...what?! Did he follow them for two hours without being seen or did he just go straight there and pick a random spot to hide along the trail in the hopes they'd walk by? And for what?! Just to spy on them?!Many things didn't make sense with this film once it was all said and done but I didn't mind the ride and I've def seen much worse.",The Rental

The premise is of course not especially original (some friends for the weekend go to a vacation house and are being harassed by strange phenomena and brutal force from un unknown source), but within this genre it's a fine movie with a solid story and pretty good acting. All four characters get some personal depth, the tension is slowly being built up and when things definitely go awry the pace is high and the violent goings-on are pretty scary.After the climax of the movie, there's some sort of epilogue that in a calm and matter-of-fact way shows how things can (and will) happen again, with the cynical message that it can happen to any of us.

58,movieman6-413-929510,Dave Franco tries too many new things for the first time.,4,24 July 2020,"The Rental is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced by Dave Franco. This is the first film he has directed and he is more known as an actor in the film world.In the film, brothers Charlie (Dan Stevens) and Josh (Jeremy Allen White) decide to go on a weekend trip with their friends. They have found a perfect house online by the sea and are trying to make it a pleasant weekend. They only suspect that their landlord is somewhat racist towards Josh his Muslim girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand). Despite this mistrust, the four try to make it a fun weekend, but during this time together they get to know each other better than they expected. This is how their mutual relationships are tested. When Charlie discovers they've been secretly filmed all weekend, he must choose to find the hidden footage or confess what he secretly did over the weekend.Dave Franco has portrayed this film as his first directed film, but he has also taken on a bit too much hay by partly writing and producing this film. By taking on all these different tasks, he still struggles to convey the film clearly. At one point, the movie almost comes across as a long episode of Temptation Island and turns more into a teen drama than a horror thriller. This aspect comes to the fore without further explanation. Due to these unclear and sudden changes of genre, the film can come across as tedious.The acting comes across as nice, but due to the unclear script, the cast doesn't really have many chances to make something special out of their roles.

71,MinistryofDoom,A Solid directorial debut from Dave Franco but not without it's flaws,6,2 August 2020,"Dave Franco's writing and directorial debut, The Rental, is a good entry to his portfolio as a new film-maker. It's not a bad start by any means and with further development and experience, I can only imagine that he'll get better. The Rental is a horror/thriller in the style of The Strangers, Last House on The Left, or When a Stranger Calls. The story follows two couples who rent a seaside home for a short vacation and discover that they are being watched by a mysterious presence. The film painstakingly develops each of the characters so that they're not just expendable victims like in other films, this is both good and bad as it explains who these people are, why they are there, and what motives and personality traits they have. However, this intricate process of character development causes the film to take too long to get to the violent tension at the climax of the story. Throughout the duration of the film we're provided with minor details and nuances that hint at a presence or some mysterious event that will eventually unfold. For instance, a locked door, strange items, or a feeling that they're being watched someone somewhere. When all of these things come together and the true story is revealed, the payoff isn't really that great. Alot of the violence is perpetrated offscreen and the ending leaves more to be desired. I would define this are more of a character study set within the backdrop of a home invasion thriller. In that regard, it's OK, if that was the intention.",The Rental

From then on she claims the guy who rents the place is a racist, because...well, it's 2020.
Of course our protagonist's girlfriend is neurotic and paranoid throughout because...well, she's a woman.
Drama unfolds because otherwise it would just be two couples at a 'beach' house, there literally is no other reason for it. and then murders start to happen, because something has to at least attempt to put some life into this.
Of course there's the well known trope of killer manages to wipe out everyone with total ease other than the last 'victim' whom he has to have some kind of struggle with or it's not a psycho killer film.
Yeah this was ok, no better than that, no worse. There were no surprises, nothing shocked, nothing happened that you couldn't have seen coming if you've watched any 'isolated' horror before in your life. All boxes were ticked, it's just getting really tiresome now though. There's so many scenarios which could be used in horror, but we keep getting force fed the same bland fare time after time.

82,Svenstadt,I'm being nice here. Typical teenage horror drama.,6,21 August 2020,"I've read other reviews on this site, which I will address before giving my summation. First, someone said that it seemed as if Dave Franco was trying to do too much (ie directing, writing, producing) with this movie and that he sometimes got sloppy on one or the other. There's a scene in the movie where Mina (discount Nasim Pedrad) tries to show the maintenance man that a hidden camera is in their shower head. This is an example of sloppy directing because they never show the shower head, and the character never points and the maintenance man looks away while talking!! So, this must be what the reviewer was talking about: very poor and inexcusable directing!!! Next, this movie seems to be divided into two pieces: the first half is almost like a teen romance-drama, which turns into a horror-thriller in the second half. It is almost like Full Metal Jacket in that sense. Another thing about this is, there's a McGuffin regarding the identity of the villain/killer/pervert, which the viewer is left to think is the maintenance man. Again, half way through, this is revealed to be wrong. Let's go back to the beginning for a full synopsis. Four urban professionals decide to book a rental property as a weekend vacation due to the stresses of work. Mina (Discount Nasim Pedrad) and her boyfriend, Discount Jacob Weber, are suspicious that the landlord is racist because of how he talks to Discount Nasim Pedrad, who has a Muslim sounding name. So, Mina and the other guy have an affair in the shower, and later discover that it was recorded on hidden cam. Now, they must think of a way to cover it up, but can't come up with a good plan. The other girl is having trouble with her man, who just had the affair. They party a little bit, have a good time, then the story turns dark in the second half. Near the end the characters start getting knocked off one by one. The film ends with the villain winning. It's not as if it's bad, it's just average. As someone who grew up in the 80's, I find the whole dialogue of this generation in 2020 to be distracting, because this generation just doesn't feel like home to me. The main criticism is the unevenness of the whole thing. Maybe I'm being a little harsh. I'm sure that Dave Franco was trying to do something a little different.

I don't think I'm spoiling anything to say the plot revolves around a cast who rent a summer home for the weekend and something something serial killer stalker etc.In order to avoid yawning through these genre features you really just need one of two things; either an interesting dynamic between the prey or an interesting antagonist. This lacked both. The cast is largely unlikable, there's no one interesting here. The villain, while given a somewhat interesting twist at the end, is largely one note. It was just all very milquetoast.It's a shame really, I noticed this is Dave Francos writing and directorial debut so that may account for the lack of polish.

92,BeanieCore,Worth a rental.,6,23 March 2021,"This is the directorial debut of Dave Franco. I must say, I had no idea that Franco had any interest in directing, let alone would I have guessed that his first film would be a horror film. Much to my surprise, this turned out to be a decent effort, if not anything particularly memorable. The script was penned by Franco alongside indie star Joe Swanberg. Swanberg was part of the ""mumblegore"" movement in the early 2010's, among directors like Ti West and Adam Wingard, so I was expecting this film to have a restrained, subtle feel to it. And that's exactly what it is.The film takes it's time building up character, and the dialogue is well penned enough that we develop some rather complicated relationships to these people. Acting is also fantastic across the board, and the cast features some familiar faces like Dan Stevens and Allison Brie. Some may find this slow start boring, but I thought it functioned well as a character drama, and lends itself to making the proceedings more tense, as we actually care about the characters.And for some time, the ending is quite tense and throws in an interesting twist. But I'd be lying if I said the film breaks any new ground. It simply becomes a rehash of every home invasion thriller we've seen since ""The Strangers"", albeit more emotional and effective than many of it's peers. All together, this was an enjoyable, occasionally effective offering, even if not remarkable in any way. Franco shows some promise here, and may be a director worth keeping an eye on.",The Rental

This is dave franco's first project, writing it, directing it, with actors who were probably his friends helping him out for a weekend of shooting. Franco wanted the writing/directing/producing credit, and he got it, and it will hopefully lead to better things, like it did his older brother.But that doesn't mean I could recommend it.This starts out slow, unfolds slow, ends slow. It lacks tension, and really lacks pacing. The plot points are soft. Now ok, let's say he's trying to make something that's more subtle than the usual throwaway mystery thriller fare. In that, he succeeded. But we don't care about the characters, and it's just not written well enough. The directing, on the other hand, is good.I tried to figure if he was homaging something. If he was, it was I Know What You Did Last Summer, albeit a less campy take. He probably grew up watching that as a kid. Otherwise, I didn't spot movie in-jokes or easter eggs.

It follows a pair of couples staying in a rental house, when they realize something strange and creepy is happening. The film has some things I appreciate like characters blatantly calling out racist characters' microaggressions and a plot that subverts expectations. However, the film is weak in its motivations and the sense of emptiness it carries.

The depths of the secrets in this film really keeps engaged. A very solid directing performance from Dave Franco.

Charlie (Dan Stevens), his brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White) and they girlfriends decide to take a weekend trip out to a very nice house in the hills. What was supposed to be a celebratory get-away begins to get darker and darker.REVIEW:
In case you didn't understand my title, it's a reference to the Showtime TV Series ""Shameless"" where Jeremy Allen White plays a character name ""Lip"" (short for Philip) and it's really nice to see him a part of another film since he is my absolute favorite character from Shameless.The Rental is Dave Franco's directorial debut and I will say that I can see potential in his ability. This film felt like a film that was supposed to be 2-hours, but was forced to cut 40 minutes out of the runtime. I'm not saying that 2 hours would've serviced this film, but it just felt rushed. The acting is this is done well as you'd expect from the cast, however, the story itself was just bland. It was a simple premise that's been used a million times and I'm not saying it can't be done well, but what Franco tries to do here, doesn't add anything. In fact, I'd say it took away from the sub genre. For being less than an hour and a half, it felt like it took forever for anything thrilling began to happen and when it finally did, there was 10 minutes left in the film and so it was rushed. Now, the twist they were going for could've worked in a film that moved at a faster pace or in a film with a long runtime. This idea of not knowing is the scariest part only works when you have time to build a connection. A perfect example is Michael Myers in Halloween. We have no idea what his motive is, but we have a connection to him. We know who he is and through the runtime in the original 1978 Carpenter version, we're with him and the main character long enough to build the tension. It allows us to connect to the main character and for us to be interested in this hunter and hunted story. A film that is able to encapsulate this well in a short amount of time is ""Hush."" A very well made cat and mouse, where we don't know the motive, which in turn makes it a more impactful horror.At the end of the day, I could see Dave Franco as a talented director and this as his first lesson. I do hope he tries again and writes a script that captures what he was looking for in a more affective way. 4/10.",The Rental

In this thriller, you are stalled for a bit until it seems clear what it all boils down to. Moral wrongdoing must be atoned for, you think. But the perpetrator is so unrelated to this quartet. Who is this man? The outrageous and actually consistent thing about this film is that this man seems to have no motive for his actions. And he will continue to do so in the future, because he will not be found out. I don't quite understand why a rather poor rating is given here, and even if ""The Rental"" is not incredibly original now, it is still a well-crafted film that creates an uneasy atmosphere that you can't assess for a long time.

Cynical, tense and twisted, ""The Rental"" is a slow, violent romp around the worst parts of couple vacations.Although it takes its time getting to its brutal denouement, the film wastes no time in painting its four leads as horribly as possible. When chaos ensues, their addictions, malaises and secrets cause enough of a maelstrom that their inability to see what's happening before its way too late makes sense. Scenes of fake domestic bliss, close ups of roving eyes, guilty faces in the background and careless slips of tongue keep tension from ever ebbing as the situation worsens.A great first flick from Dave Franco, with a great cast ready to be awful.

The story sets when two couples rent a vacation home and what should have been a fun getaway it turns into horror. A familiar concept, done in different ways, and yet Dave Franco's impressive mind came up with one of the most intense films, a fresh gem for this genre. Everything was perfectly calculated the right balanced buildup of introducing what the characters were about while the desired element lingers in the background, and an outstanding execution when it reaches the climax. The timely suspense was escalating the tension, from the moment it starts the tightness never stopped and loved every second of it. How terrifying it is to think that this could really happen and how also it rings of truth on relationship problems. A common situation in which surrounds the saying ""what goes around comes around"" gets an effective judgment. The ending sequence was flawless and terrifying, there is no better way to end it plus a sharp execution towards the music.I'm amazed by the composers Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans! they really know how to get in your skin with their music! I love their work with the film The Lodge (2019) and now they keep bringing more of their phenomenal sinister vibe.The cast Dan Stevens, Sheila Vand, Jeremy Allen White, and Alison Brie performed amazingly. I have to give it to Dan Stevens, how he keeps nailing every role and his presence gives any scene a unique captivating vibe. Also much-love attention to Sheila Vand, what a beauty and outstanding performance, she needs to do more movies in lead roles like this one.",The Rental

And this movie could have been interesting as a psychological drama looking at relationship dynamics in two morally vapid couples. Or even as an examination of latent racism.But the plot turns are so absurd as to be comical. You've got the two couples standing on the porch having a debate about what to do next, while a man lies, unattended, bleeding, seriously hurt, in the bathtub. Then, for the remainder, there's more consternation over an infidelity than having killed a guy! Talk about moral priorities. For a movie like this to work have to care a little about the people being stalked.Kept waiting for some plot turn at the end that would redeem this movie.

There is a lot to like about this movie even though it's not a perfect movie. First of the cast in this movie all do a great job in there respected roles but the 2 main stand outs of this movie have to be Dan Stevens and Alison Brie are both really great in this movie. The music in this movie honestly is really good to and it plays a great part in setting up the creepy autmosphere in this movie. This movie also has pretty good cinematography and also is a really pretty movie. The scares in this movie are very little but when they happen they are very well done and honestly had a chill going down my spine. The movie also doesn't overstay it's welcome it's only a 90 minute movie and that is perfect runtime for this movie. The movie is also a lot of fun to watch. But this is not a perfect movie at all and it does have some problems to it. The characters in this movie are not likeable at all they are all jerks yes Stevens and Brie's characters are the only decent characters in this movie but they are still jerks. The movies also has a lot of horror movie cliches that can't be escaped. Also, this movie does have a lot of interesting plot points that just don't get any looking into which sucks because they were really interesting.

147,tlooknbill,Cleverly toys with the audience's established notions of the thriller genre.,10,4 August 2020,"The pandemic has me wanting to get out and see a movie so I checked IMDB reviews and watched the trailer only to be a bit disappointed. Screw it! Went anyway.Ok, yes it's kinda' predictable with unknown to me actors but why was it getting me to talk at the characters in the theater (the theater was empty) as the plot slowly and casually unfolded with a dark and brooding atmosphere and creepy POV's by both the director and cinematographer? it's a very well acted, beautifully photographed slow paced mature interpretation of the thriller genre. And after it ended I felt I saw a very good movie because I was thoroughly entertained. HUH?! Was I being hypnotized into liking what appears to be a contrived movie?I mean every preconception and logical conclusion associated with this movie genre were displayed on screen but setup, presented and resolved with a quick delivery that defied all of this. Things aren't as they obviously appear which is even more evident at the end of the movie that had me scratching my head days after when it finally dawned on me this was a clever way to loop back to dash even further the audience's preconceptions of what they thought they saw and at the same time what it implies about short term vacation rentals like AirBnB.There's an antagonist that later appears you think is who he's suppose to be, motivated by actions you conclude is obvious revenge or entrapment as events and circumstances slowly unfold to prevent the renters from calling the police. No. That wouldn't make sense due to it conflicting with the screwed up relationships between the two couples that create more complex motivations and intent. How is this going to be resolved without police intervention?The writer, director and cinematographer appear to be guiding the audience using familiar short and brief scenes mixed with long contemplative camera angles and odd out of focus close ups that sneaks up on the audience to vaguely reveal a dark figure right of screen so you're not sure what it is but have to obviously conclude is the antagonist, or the landlord?

150,nehpetstephen,"It's not great, but ""pointless"" isn't the right word either",5,8 December 2020,"The many one-star reviews here provide an interesting glimpse into popular taste. Apparently, a movie about psychopathy is supposed to end with some Scooby Doo unmasking, where the crazed maniac who has just murdered the entire cast unmasks himself and reveals some perfectly reasonable, linear motivation for his behavior which, upon looking back, the viewer will realize has been cleverly foreshadowed by the filmmakers all along. This is the convention--oh, so that's what caused all this mayhem!--and of course it's sometimes satisfying, but more often than not it renders the film cheap, tidy, and forgettable. And the lengths filmmakers will go to in order to sufficiently shock you--the red herrings, the duplicitous sociopath best friends--is often quite awful. It's been decades since I saw the original BONE COLLECTOR movie, but I'll never forget my bafflement and utter disappointment when the big twisty reveal happened and all I and my companion could think was, ""Who the heck is that?"" Honestly, it would have been better if the killer had just been a random person.Which, I'm pretty sure, is how serial murder often works. The idea that some narrative bow is going to tie everything up at the end of a bloodbath is, well, disrespectful to the victims of the unfortunate number of real-life bloodbaths this country bears witness to. Sometimes people are just violent and deranged and like to watch people suffer, and though they probably have reasons for their behavior, that behavior probably has little or nothing to do with their victims. Would it have made things better if you learned at the end of THE RENTAL that the killer was the caretaker's brother, and that he had been cheated on by his wife, and that that's why he murdered anyone any time he witnessed a sexual transgression? Would that make it okay? Would that make their murders sensible and satisfying?That said, this isn't a great movie. I like the fresh, anarchic randomness of the conclusion, and Toby Huss and Jeremy Allen White are standouts in the cast, but the screenplay suffers from some implausible depictions of psychology and behavior--which is to say, too often the characters make choices that just seem terribly stupid and unnatural, and it seems like they only do what they do because the plot demands it and not because actual people would behave that way.So, yes, this was neither an excellent nor an awful way to spend 89 minutes, but anyone suggesting that a review of more than 4 stars is a ""paid promotion"" has an extremely narrow view of what a movie is allowed to be like.",The Rental

158,michaeljpfitzgerald,"A proper, old school morality horror movie.",5,25 July 2020,"This movie is cooler and cooler the more I think about it - it's a pretty modern American drama: no one is clean, everyone has secrets, the only real relationship is family. It's also a slasher film, in which the nameless, unexplained psycho who does the deed doesnt show up or do anything until people start to 'transgress' or reveal their past mistakes - instead of drugs and sex and drinking at the lake, the moral crimes of the seventies and eighties in movies, instead it's infidelity, rage, duplicity, a lack of loyalty.The characters err, they are punished - a pretty standard horror movie formula, but because of the quality of the acting and script, it really plays like a drama, almost until the end of the film. That's a neat trick, especially for Franco's first time out as a director.In regards to the spate of really poor reviews: there's a new kind of amateur film critic {let's be clear, I'm one too, we all are} who views anything at all that isn't patiently explained in exposition to be an indication that the movie is bad and 'unrealistic'. I blame yout*be reviewers tearing into every movie looking for ways to fill time, but the result is that those viewers encounter a film like this - which is calm and patient and engrossing, but which chooses to explain *nothing* about itself, and these new amateur critics decide the movie is bad because of that choice, while thinking it was the result of mistakes in making the movie.I really, really dug this, and heartily recommend it.",The Rental

I would give the first 3/4 of the movie an 8 and the last 1/4 a 6, so an average 7.The problem I think is that ending was the original idea of the movie. Some psycho who bugs short rental homes and hunts down those who come after him. The rest of the movie is the story built up on the original idea. In the case of the rental the built up story around is much better than the original idea, so much so that they should have scrapped the ending and come up with something else.The first part of the movie is an intense logical thriller that builds up and up and makes up wonder what's going to happen next. The ending is like a mindless mediocre horror movie.One possible better ending would have been this for example: an extra character was introduced at the beginning, like a co-workers of the two lovers. For some career money reason this character wanted them dead or ruin their lives somehow. So he or she would be the person in the end behind the whole thing. Just an idea, but it would have kept the movie as a thriller. A little bit like 'the gift', which is thriller/horror but it remains logical and delivers from start to the end.With that said, it's still a good movie, with good acting.

Is he a fabulous actor? Hmmm.. Could he be a celebrity without his brother being so successful in the industry? Hummm... A good director? Not yet, for sure. This is his debut title, and is not memorable. Like others say, nothing new, nothing really shines.I started watching this without knowing that this is directed by Dave Franco. Since horror/thriller is my genre, I must've briefly read the synopsis and kept it in my watch list sometime in the past. I found this title on Prime video today and began watching with the assumption which some ill-intentioned person/people would bring a horror to protagonists.
Well.. I was right, but it took a while to get there because this movie spends 2/3 of its length for relationship dramas between the main characters. I don't care the quarrels and a mistrust brought by their infidelities. Creepy stuff is happening so let's get the story going and show me who's behind this! How are they gonna resist to surrender to this sicko!
Unfortunately, you won't see those. I am so disappointed. There is no arc, I got bored since I wasn't intended to watch a soap opera and then all of sudden, Boom! The killer strikes! What!? Let me have a chance to invest emotionally into this psycho in order to enjoy the suspense!Some reviewers pointed out that characters should be younger for better explanations for their poor decision making and childish acts. I totally agree. I think the reason why these characters are older than it actually fits the story is because Dave Franco wanted to use his wife as one of the main characters. Maybe he felt more confident working with someone he knows quite well in real life. However, that didn't seem to turn out so well in this case.The cinematography is watchable, but nothing special, in fact, some parts are hard to see what's going on due to the lack of light.Some people mention 'The Strangers'. Yeah, I can see the resemblance. Personally, I think 'The Open House' has a more similar feel to this movie. Although I didn't find those films so interesting, they gave more screen time for the psycho character(s). For that, I have to give more credit to them than to this film.

I really like Alison Brie and Dan Stevens, and assumed it would be good enough with both of them.You have to watch the entire movie for it to really make sense, and there is some misdirection (or missed direction) in what the theme of the movie is. It starts off as a stiff relationship drama with characters that aren't sympathetic...the only one that is even modestly likable is Alison Brie's character (I had to look up her name Michelle). A few exposition scenes and they have an awkward interaction with the renter of the house.Then there are jump scares and red herrings, and at about the hour mark you begin to think that maybe the evening's movie choice should have been different. I admit throughout the cinematography was well-done and the music was good.But then things start to take off quickly and almost every thriller/horror trope is ignored. Okay, maybe this was worth it but holy crap this is getting dark.Without giving spoilers, the last few minutes of the movie make the whole thing worth it, it's a montage that reveals the entire story and everything that went behind it.

I got the feeling maybe he did go missing for a while, they spend so much time looking for him, I was surprised we didn't see some of the crew walking around too, saying, here boy, here boy, we know it's a lousy movie but you need to be a professional about it.This movie makes Friday the 13th look like Schindler's List. And this is coming from someone who has seen pretty much all of them and even enjoyed them to a greater or lesser degree. I mean, at least those movies have a point. Guy puts on a hockey mask, goes around killing young people, before, during and after having sex, it actually makes a lot of sense if you think about it. It's just harmless good fun.But this movie? Again it's true I hated all of them so I was glad when they all died, but it was like, hey, wait a minute, they're all dead all of a sudden, because they got killed by some guy who shows up two thirds of the way through the movie? What a waste. I mean, I was hoping they would all get into their car and drive off the cliff, not by accident, just because they are total morons who realize themselves that they have no reason to live. Talk about a let down.It's just so unbelievably pathetic. I mean, who can't do that? In any movie? Oh, look, there's Luke Skywalker about to lead the rebel resistance against the Death Star, oh, but wait, some guy just showed up and killed them all with a hammer. Bet no one ever saw that one coming. Oh, Jack and Rose are trying to find true love on Titanic, oh, but wait, some guy came and killed everyone with a hammer, talk about a tragic ending. And there's Jack trying to spend quality time with his family in the Shining, and then some guy shows up with an axe... okay, maybe that's not a good example.Even by the movie's own logic it's stupid. Three of the killings take place outside the house so you can't even say the killer gets some kind of perverse pleasure watching the killings at a later date. I mean, if it's going to happen, why couldn't he have the basic decency to do it as soon as they showed up at the house. Movie could have been over in like fifteen minutes and I could have had the rest of my night free.So yeah, I'm going with the dog as the ring leader. I mean, we don't know for sure he wasn't behind everything, maybe the guy who killed everyone worked for him. After all, he's like that dog in that tv commercial - that is one smart dog, he beats her at chess and even talks. I bet he could come up with a better idea than this turkey of a movie.",The Rental

People complaining about the ending and that there was no meaning behind it. Sorry but how many killers kill for the thrill without any actually reason behind it. I don't get that argument. It's a very realistic situation, could happen to anyone renting a place over the weekend and that's what I liked most about it. I was entertained the whole time. The only reason why I give this an 8 is bc the third act was a bit too fast for my taste. Anyways if you like thrillers\scary movies .. this one is fun to watch!",The Rental

189,cockadoody73,"First half soap opera, second half thriller.",6,17 August 2020,"Firstly I'll just say I liked this film, it was an entertaining way to spend a Sunday afternoon with a slight hangover. It's not particularly original (gang of people on a holiday weekend being stalked by a stranger) and it didn't offer anything new, but it's still an ok watch.So, the soap opera bit, two couples - brothers with their wife and girlfriend - go off to a ludicrously posh weekend rental.
Creepyish manager had previously refused to rent to Mina (she's a Muslim woman) but then happily rented to Charlie, her brother in law and business partner, an hour later. And there we have the PC, 'let's be woke' element which, in reality, doesn't really go anywhere except for Mina huffing around for a while and disliking aforementioned creepy manager.
They unpack, Michelle (the only likeable character who I actually rooted for) has brought some 'Molly' which she gives to the others, she doesn't take any because she wants to hike to a waterfall the next day. Best of luck with that Michelle.
Michelle goes to bed, the other three stay up, get high and drunk. Josh, Mina's boyfriend and Charlie's brother passes out. Mina and Charlie jump in the hot tun, things get a bit heated and you can guess the rest. They end up having sex in the shower whilst their other - better - halves sleep.Next day Mina and Charlie claim hangovers and stay in the huge house whilst Michelle and Josh go off on the hike. During the day Mina discovers a camera in the shower head, throwing her and Charlie into shock in case Michelle and Josh find out.
On the hike Josh gives Michelle a few home truths about Charlie, which upsets her and she is cold to him when they return to the house.
This is the point where the movie actually starts to move, because up until now it's been nothing more than a soap opera at best.Charlie and Mina now set about finding and disposing of the evidence. Michelle - upset, high and drunk - rings creepy manager to fix hot tub, and the whole thriller starts.
Accusations, a fight, a body (the cliff scene is ridiculous), road spikes, a missing dog, remote controlled showers, and a few more ludicrous elements all come into play. It's pretty effective, the stalking and violence are well done.
Like I said, the only person I gave a damn about was Michelle. The characters are pretty awful people, shallow and predictable. It's an ok way to spend a couple of hours, just don't expect too much. Slightly overhyped online.",The Rental

197,AfrocenteredReviews,"Surveillance, suspicion, infidelity, isolation, drugs, violence, terror",8,17 November 2021,"This review is for a movie similar to The Night House that I was anxiously waiting for, but different in that I really had a great time watching it. Surveillance, suspicion, infidelity, isolation, drugs, violence, terror. Includes #spoilers :
-
The Rental (2020) Pros: Dan Stevens is a white actor I trust to be involved in great, twisted things (Legion, Apostle). And the vampire from A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, Sheila Vand, stared in this too. This did not disappoint. I knew the basic set up but had not watched the whole trailer. The cheating element was really juicy and the revelations were teased out at perfect times. The killing was so abrupt that I was like ""Ooooo"" every time it happened. The plot, action, and tension were exciting, the acting itself was great. When I saw the camera in the shower my mind was blown. I was like EWWWWWWw. I didn't know this story was gonna go the hidden camera killer way. But he didn't do it as a creepy thing like 13 Cameras, just for murder, blackmail, and scare tactics. I would connect this to Hell Fest where the killer's identity was teased at the end of the movie and there were other Easter eggs like Josh finding polaroids in the basement, that could be brought up in a sequel/prequel that I would watch.-
Cons: I think the revelation at the end that this killer is doing this a lot was on the iffy side. And the renting process, shorty was using the same website I believe to rent out that spot before the other dude. I think it would have been a clearer A-Ha moment if they had been using different apps or it was clear that the killer had his own situation like folks were finding the spot through Craigslist or something off the grid. Makes the rental scenario of filling these places with cameras and then murdering them make sense. Because in the end it shows him doing it a lot, but there would be a paper trail so I do not think he would be killing that many people tbh.-
I give it a strong 8. For the confusing part that I mentioned about the renting process, no supernatural elements, and my high interest in seeing a sequel.",The Rental

And let alone if people found them they would just blame the owner of the house.Then the very last frame of the movie rolled through and I got my answer. Pretty lame.

203,tankfreak,Room for improvement (if there's a sequel)...,5,22 January 2021,"The brief synopsis is 2 couples consisting of 2 brothers and their significant others, all in their 30's, decide to spend a weekend together at an Air B&B type rental house. Once there, they immediately have friction with the landlord, but decide to brush it off and go on with their weekend plans of fun, recreational drug use, and other debauchery, at least until they get the distinct feeling they're being watched.
I'd definitely say it's not as bad as the average imdb review lead me to believe, but I'm also glad I rented it instead of doing a blind buy, which I had considered based on the cast. Some of the gripes don't make sense to me honestly. Multiple people have said the movie would have been better if the characters were all teens instead of adults because it would explain their drug use and poor decisions throughout...uhhhm...because adults can't do either of those things?? Clearly no one in their 30s does drugs, has anger and/or honesty issues, cheats, is at all immature, or fears calling police due to their illegalities and other poor decisions. Nope, only teens do that according to some of these reviews.**Vague Spoilers Ahead**
The other consistent gripe is apparently the lack of clear motive for the killer. This movie is another from what's starting to get dubbed the ""hobby killer"" subgenre. Basically a killer (or killers) who stalks/kills/taunts as a hobby or sport, without having any specific motive towards the individual victims/protagonists. Soooo, like actual serial killers. I honestly don't know why viewers have such a big problem with this subgenre (think movies like The Strangers and ATM). Granted, sometimes it doesn't work and the lack of any specific motive can make a movie feel absolutely pointless in the end (The Open House (2018), for example) especially if the progression of the film leads the viewer to expect a clear motive or at least the killer's identity in the end. However, I think if the movie is done well otherwise and is suspenseful/tense, then the antagonist's desire to frighten, terrorize, and/or kill, if for no other reason than just for their sick pleasure and the sake of getting away with it is enough motive on its own.That's not to say this movie didn't have other issues though. What didn't really work for The Rental is some of the typical clichéd and tropey character actions, especially once they started piling up. I'm less concerned about the killer's overall motive than wondering why the protagonists are making their questionable decisions, and then doubling down on them, which other than just being typical horror movie character bad decision behavior, doesn't really make sense here. Unfortunately the script doesn't give enough character background or development to make their individual actions seem logical after a certain point, much less relatable. I suppose that's why some of the other reviewers thought this would be better suited as a teen driven horror movie.Moving on, it's got some pacing issues throughout, the dialogue is bland more often than not, and it really lacks enough character development throughout to get you attached to most of the characters, much less to understand the choices they make once things start getting weird. On the upside, the cast is solid and the acting is good (particularly Sheila Vand and Dan Stevens), the production values are good all the way down the usual checklist (there's none of that it's so dark you can't see what's happening nonsense), and the dog survives. Overall it makes for a decent suspense thriller that turns a bit more slasher-esque in the 3rd act. I'd say if you're bored and you want a horror thriller you haven't seen yet, it's definitely watchable, but I wouldn't recommend going in with high expectations of something new for the genre. If Dave Franco does manage to pull a sequel out of this, hopefully he'll trim some of the tropes and work on better character development so the audience at least cares about the fates of the humans and not just the dog.",The Rental

It's got great editing, ominous music, and a good cast.It sets up foreboding situations, so you're ready for something to go wrong. As the story unfolds, issues only the privileleged could get themselves into begin to unfold. Selfish behavior leads to paranoia. The writer of this has most definitely lived an upper class life, because the problems these character's face are unbearably avoidable by anyone who knows what a hard day really feels like. Also, the characters are vapid and heartless.I found it incredibly frustrating to watch rich people fight over their rotten ideals and entitlement, all while they jump to conclusions instead of communicate the way real friends and family should.

214,TheSmallDeth,The Shower-Head Complot,6,28 July 2020,"Last weekend i've seen The Rental and I got to admit it's a very enjoyable flick. The first three quarters of the movie feel a bit slow and forced, it's all about setting the stage for the final act and feeding into the Paranoia-vibe. In the last 20 mins or so, all hell breaks loose (Horror enters the stage) and it goes downhill pretty quickly. I'd really have liked to see more glimpses of this in the earlier stage of the movie.
It seems The Rental borrowed a lot from horror classics like Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre but also more recent movies like The Collector. It tries, but in my opinion fails, to deliver this anxiety/paranoia In the same way these movies do.
Nevertheless The Rental is a decent movie, mainly because of the acting. Don't expect anything innovative or new, just a basic digital-home-invasion movie :)",The Rental

217,brandonsmuxx,A decent debut plagued by predictably.,6,10 August 2020,"Have you seen 13 Cameras? Franco certainly has. It's pretty similar.

I won't spoil whether there is a survivor, survivors, or are no survivors at all..but that's really the only part that mildly surprised me.
All that said, this isn't a bad movie. It's also not a good movie. It's the epitome of an average slasher. That's fine though. I appreciate Franco choosing the horror genre. This may be a one time thing, but if he sticks with horror and has better material, he could carve himself a name in the genre. For his first attempt, it's hard to be overly critical. I do see promise and would gladly watch his next horror film to see the growth, should he choose to give it a go. I think a found footage film would be suit him well.",The Rental

Kudos to him already for choosing a horror film as his first, automatic points in my book. The premise revolves around 2 couples who rent a vacation home for the weekend together and things don't go quite the way they had hoped, standard right? Well to be honest the whole film is pretty straightforward, it's a story and setup we've seen before and for the most part, things play out as you'd expect. But what elevates things here to another tier is it's cast and Franco's choice of visuals. The performances really do make a big difference here in pulling you in while Franco treats a familiar subject with a fresh and eager approach. Tension is built nicely throughout the movie while Alison Brie shines with moments of light hearted-ness and brings the dramatic chops as well. There's some kills also, for those of you who were wondering.Some might not care for the same ol' same old in a shinier package and I understand that. I for one appreciate the effort as long as it's delivered well, cared for and you're given quality which is what I believe we have here.

That is an excuse. This is a movie, a work of art. I want to know the answers and I want to know the motivation. This is a lazy attempt at writing a random killer without giving a background.Now you can have a killer with no actual facial connection. You can have those mysterious movies. A movie called ""Unfriended: Dark Web"" had a great motivation. Basically, it was a secret elite force. Now that movie was hot garbage in other ways, but it was the correct way to have a killer with no connection or much interaction with the main cast. Or something that has the answers for yourself. Like Forest Gump, where it's implied that Jenny finally became free like a bird at the end of the movie.This didn't do either of those things. We never find out who the killer is.

Although, even in this part, one can note a good camera and acting work. All the fun is left for the second part. It is worth noting the very smooth flow of the whole picture. Even at the most intense moment, you still feel how everything moves smoothly and slowly develops. This is not a traditional horror movie, but rather a drama with horror movie elements. At the same time, it cannot be said that the picture stands out within these genres. She seems to be missing something. For drama - tragedy, for horror - suspense. Fans of drive will not like this film, but I recommend it to everyone else.",The Rental
228,expertocrede,Say Cheeseee :),7,7 May 2021,"I like the reverse house poster of the film which doesn't properly reflect the story but really nice.I was getting bored 30-35 minutes later. I can not distinguish the story. Is it about forbidden love or is that a horror movie? Subplot is very prominent in the first half.The house is by the sea. I like this feature. It is a distinctive characteristic from other horror movies. We are tired of single houses at the woods. If only the director didnt use the fog machine, also we are tired of using fog machines in the movies especially at the forest scenes.In the last 20 minutes all events suddenly happen. Director didn't extend the chasing scenes which feels like real time apart from the movie.I like Alison Brie's acting. After the first homicide her transition and becaming insane is really cool and impressive.The exact story becames clear at the end of the movie. We can say it's curious.",The Rental

I would have liked to see something like the owner of the house is a loner weirdo creep, who hides inside a secret control room, he enjoys disturbing ""normal"" people lives/enjoyment by doing little evil acts (cutting the light, puncture the tires, robbing money, unhiding secrets, showing up infidelities, etc) but this time goes way to far and the unstable cheated brother goes rogue killing his brother, then maybe kills his gf and finally kills himself... all while the peeping tom creep laughs and enjoy, that would be cool.",The Rental

The deaths are just no sense and the principal character just vanish, ending in nothing.They don't explain anything about the antagonist, just leave us with nothing but confusion.Is a movie with the typical plot, which again, is not the problem.

The reason behind the 1 or 2 star reviews is the fact the movie exposes racism.

It's their opinion I know, but here is mine: The film kept me watching the whole time without a second of boredom and that's a very rare thing these days. I liked it, what can I say? Yes, it's been done before but this movie is well directed and it has a slow but really catching pace that makes you want to see the whole thing. The 4 main characters are well written and it's impressive how I didn't want a single of them to die, most of the time in horror movies there are characters that are just annoying or don't have anything to add but in this film everyone plays an important part in building up the tension.

Same with The Rental, we were convinced there was going to be a punny twist or something that would justify it was in the box office. Nope. Never happened. By the end, Franco even teases us (see how I still give him credit after a whole movie of not knowing how to go anywhere?) with a cute payoff.

I'm really glad I watched it because it was probably one of the best horror/suspense films I've watched in awhile. It's always best when you have a very limited cast for a thriller or horror film, it keeps things nice and tight. I was entertained through out the entire film and for this being Dave Franco's big debut, I am much impressed.

I think the point of this movie is very clear.
The makers of this movie wanted to disturb people who rent homes or places in real life, with the idea of hidden cams and a psychopath.

I saw the meager rating on here before I started the movie and I went in with low expectations, but I was more than surprised, especially with the ending..As soon as the credits rolled I knew, clearly, why people have an issue with this movie. It did two things that turn off mainstream audiences, but I actually find refreshing. 1. It took its time and developed characters, whether you found them likable and care whether they live or not, is subjective. 2. The ambiguous ending. There was also a third component; not a storytelling device, but a plot point and turn in the story. 3. Why wouldn't you just own up to cheating and call the police immediately?""Who was he?!!"" Why do we need to know anything about him or why he does what he does? Isn't that more frightening? Did we need confirmation that he did, in fact, have a heinous childhood? I think it was clear that this person is a psychopathic murderer that preys for pleasure and sport. The faceless killer (and winner in the end!) doesn't need more story. If you were secretly observed, stalked, mentally tortured and ultimately murdered by a masked person, you would never know who they were or why they did it.Some people say, ""it's slow and went nowhere."" I disagree. We got to know the characters, infer their personality types, and see their strengths and weaknesses. Why didn't Charlie & Mina come clean, admit their mistake and save the day? I don't know, maybe they're self-centered narcissists? Sometimes unrealistic decisions can be picked apart as a plot failure, but in this case I think that's just who those people were. They'd rather gamble and protect their assumed respective appearance. You don't have to like and respect all characters.Also, they did a great job capitalizing on a contemporary trope with Airbnb. This may have already been used in another movie at this point, but I thought it was a great choice, especially for a confined horror film. How much is staying in a strangers home worth it for the price and location?Great job, Dave Franco. I was skeptical but I'd definitely check out another horror flick he does.",The Rental

Yet with COVID-19 restrictions and what not, an abundance of time and lack of options led me to this. For sixty-minutes of this film, the drama, character building, story... basically every element of a horror film that is, all so often, done wrong... this had all that. For sixty-minutes I witnessed four characters with motives and moral dilemma's, indifferences and affection, pour out in front of me. Let's say this wasn't a horror film, but a drama about moral decisions and character studies, this would have been a hit. But then the last thirty minutes takes everything you have loved about these characters, condenses it completely and ties a lovely generic horror ending bow on top. This is still a six, this IS a film worth watching for that sixty-minutes of fantastic scripting and acting, but you will be disappointed with the ending.

276,nicchang,A solid directorial debut from Dave Franco that goes nowhere,6,5 February 2021,"The Rental is far from being a bad film. If anything, it proves that Dave Franco can direct, especially when it comes to horror. While there's a couple of jumpscares I recall, Franco is never reliant on that loud jumpscare sting and wisely opts to develop a moody atmosphere. This is a beautiful film to look at, and despite the painfully familiar setting, the production values allow the locations to shine and develop a buildup of tension to get you invested in The Rental. With a nice soundtrack, some smart editing choices and terrific performances, the first act makes you believe you're in for a compelling character study and I have to compliment Franco's attempts to build character work. Unfortunately, the characters are never sympathetic to start off with and if the script made them bearable and more complex, it would've helped build a shocking impact.As the second act transitions into horror territory (which wasn't made clear in the first act), The Rental starts to become unsettling and creates questions to keep audiences guessing. It takes a while to get to that sweet tension, and just when it seems The Rental is really picking up... we have massive third act issues. Understandably, the characters make stupid decisions and it's the problems and distrust in their relationships that help create tension, but while The Rental makes the most out of its atmosphere, it's not a substitute for storytelling. As such, the script fails to create clues revolving around these questions, misplaces some humour in the more serious scenes and the ambiguity feels unearned. It's also lacking in originality to bring something new to the table and the ending just gave me The Open House vibes. That's not good.Granted, there's much more talented and competent filmmaking on display here. There are genuinely creepy sequences that had me gasping and there's a lot I liked in the style to make me appreciate Dave Franco's directorial debut, but the pacing drags itself out to something meaningless and the story needed one major refinement to fully achieve its potential.Plot and Characters (4/10)

280,camjace-45174,In a few years you will look back and realize the brilliance of this movie!,10,27 July 2020,"Well, this is my first review here, and I hardly care to even if I like the movie. Reason being is that I think 'complaining' has become the audience's norm these days. Too much available consumption and little time to appreciate. I had to literary unsubscribe from two long time movie review channels on YouTube for putting this movie down.If you care to hear me out, let me explain:1)
If you've ever traveled enough times to find yourself worried about being watched in an airbnb (especially abroad), you will love this movie. Tackling the subject with a horror / thriller genre just hit home for be.2)
Let's talk about directing. For a first time directer; fantastic. The scene in the end with Mina by the cliff is the most subtle 'hold your breath' I've seen this year. I mean the few seconds you need to understand what really happened. Wow. Not only was it surprising and metaphorical, but it actually flipped the genre on its head.3)
Let's talk acting. I believed everyone. Not to say I loved them. This isn't that kind of movie. People are real, stupid and selfish like all of us. But are they underdeveloped? Hell no. I didn't need to know more about them. I understood them perfectly that their decisions in the last few minutes came natural to me.4)
And now let's talk the two things I liked the most about the movie:
a - Tension. Tension. Tension. Sometimes inconsistent or slow, and sometimes you're not sure whether this is a thriller or horror or drama (though you do in the last ten minutes) but I enjoyed every moment.
b - The ending. It's not that big reveal or twist, but the way it's presented, that's the horror. Again two strikes in one. You get to have an unusual and different ending and (don't want to spoil anything) it's terrifying because of what it MEANS, not what you SEE.I lOVED this movie and will watch it again.In the end, I always remind myself that The Shining was a flop when it was first released. Is the Rental as good, not there, yet. But If Dave Franco grows into two more movies of this caliber, he will come up with something as good. You can sense it. I want to see his next.",The Rental

There's just a lot of character drama, not enough horror elements and for a little while, i was feeling abit underwhelmed by it. The movie for sure got my attention with a strong opening : the cast, the location, the direction, it was all promising, but than nothing happens with this. There's no meat to the script, which is really sad because with such a good cast, magic could have been done here for sure! Visuals are absolutely stunning and that house was gorgeous, add in the fog and the sounds of the sea and bang, you got yourself a perfect setting!

Amazing screenplay, seems totally real and cinvincing, and very well played. These are ordinary people, could be one of us. Unlike many fashionable films today, the camera work does not distract from the story, but actually helps to tell it. Kudos to Dave Franco. The ending is very un-Hollywood. That and the realism probably account for all the negative reviews here. It's way better than the usual horror flick, which fortunately it is not.

The obvious happened while their respective partners were sleeping and soon realized they were caught taped in a hidden camera in the shower head.

I wish I would have checked out early...",2,26 July 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie, unfortunately, there was nothing at all to like. A big calling point of this, for many, will be to see the directional debut of Dave Franco.Well, where to begin? This is yet another 2020 horror film that should not even be classed as a horror film at all. When over 75% of the movie is a drama, then it should be classed that way. There is hardly anything horrifying or thrilling about this one, well, except for the awful production itself. There's hardly any horror elements except for in the very latter part of the movie, even those are poorly executed.None of the characters here are likeable, there's a reason to dislike all of them. I found myself not caring about any of them, well, except for the dog. The pace is slow and the acting is mediocre. The concept itself is familiar and I couldn't help but think that I've seen this before, just executed a hell of a lot better in other movies.It feels like Dave Franco was going for a slow burn type horror that had a stunning conclusion. This is so much of a slow burner that by the time any of the action happened, I was completely disinterested. I stuck around, waiting for the climax and felt greatly let down. The conclusion, is confusing and doesn't offer any real resolve. It's a waste of time and feels like a kick in the teeth after sitting through the rest.The killer himself only gets a few minutes of actual screen time and those happen towards the very end of the film. You find out no information about him, his motive or his purpose. The kills are very weak and not at all graphic.There's literally nothing interesting here at all. A complete lack of atmosphere and tension, it feels very amateurish. Avoid.",The Rental

A movie that has been done many times before. This one really drew me in with the character development...a secret between two of them...weird things going on in the house. It was building up in a very suspenseful ending, BUT!!!! When the last 20 minutes comes along, everything that was working so well gets tossed out the window and the movie moves to a lazy ass ending.I was extremely disappointed in the ending....

Not an ounce of chemistry between any characters and the relationships were completely unbelievable.
No character development.
The killer is just some random psycho with no motive & no backstory. If this were done in a true horror genre, then perhaps it could've worked-But the movie just left the viewer hanging and waiting for some explanation of what happened and why.
All characters, except for the wife, are completely unlikable.
The story/plot is ridiculous and just makes no sense, nor do any of the characters' decisions/actions.
Barely any music or added sound effects which just left it feeling awkward and hollow (and not in a good/suspenseful way).We laughed at the end when they had a shot of the killer removing almost every single camera in the house.What a stupid movie.",The Rental

Yet I have to mention a previous review mentioning a ""flawed third act."" I can attest to this, as I felt that it had a rushed ending.

What it falls victim to is the genre tropes - got running in the forest, etc. It feels like as if someone had a great idea and just could not be bothered by finishing it with the excitement and enthusiasm that ignited the whole thing. I love what Joe S does with high concept, low budget fare and this one is a near miss.

There are number of things in this work well and up until the third half it does a good job of presenting the actors into tense situations that slowly unravel.This is where things take the wrong turn. The voyeur aspect served well to draw out the tension and had the movie remained on this track it would have been an interesting dialogue into people dealing with progressively worse decision making. It could have stayed with the voyeur theme but instead tries to quickly turn onto a slasher and it honestly doesn't work here.I couldn't help but find myself only really rooting for one of the four as she continued to make smart decisions that followed a moral compass and stayed grounded. It would have been interesting to see this play out from the standpoint of someone knowing what they were doing and pushing them to see how far they take the lie before it collapses but instead we get a rushed killer who makes quick work of the cast and it's this decision that I think is driving majority of the negativity. This is not a bad movie but it could have been so much more if they had continued forward but instead it becomes a slash and dash where the plot and decisions the characters have made no longer matter.,The Rental

No explanation for the killings or why the killer is obsessed with stalking couples, families, and friend groups in rental properties. The kills were quick, generic, and underwhelming. This movie never felt suspenseful which was disappointing. Nothing thrilling or interesting whatsoever. Small cast and every single character is irritating, boring, or both. All their relationships felt forced, but maybe that was just bad acting? They constantly mentioned how supposedly intelligent Mina and Charlie are but they don't act like it. They kept saying they have to be smart to do their jobs and how hard it was. They make it clear that they're the breadwinners. They emphasized the importance of their careers so much but never told us what they do or even what industry they're in. So many questions left unanswered like was Taylor the caretaker in on it the whole time? He said it was his brother's place but then why would his brother kill him? Why was he killing anyone though? Why do we never see his face? It didn't make it feel creepy or ominous just because they purposely didn't show his face. It just felt like they were trying too hard. Where was the dog when they couldn't find him? The cute dog was the only entertaining thing about this movie and he was actually talented lol you could clearly see he was well trained for movies / tv. Overall, this movie was just dumb. The ending made no sense. How is the killer renting these properties, getting tours, meeting the owner or people who work in the building, and then able to somehow sublease it online and have them come stay without anyone noticing or asking questions??? It's also unclear if at the end he's killing people in their apartment or if they're on vacation? I was bored pretty much the whole time. So bored that I almost didn't mind the plot holes and confusion because I just didn't really care that much. It's like the writers or the director couldn't decide if they wanted it to be a slasher flick or a drama. They certainly did a poor job of blending the two. The Rental is listed as being in the categories of drama, horror, and mystery. That's laughable. Not completely sure why, but I was expecting more from Dave Franco. Maybe it was just awkward directing his real life wife Alison Brie? I don't really care why this movie sucked, I just know that it did. It's not like I was expecting anything incredible or Oscar worthy, but seriously, what was the point of making this movie???",The Rental

It actually warrants discussing the film after the fact, and I appreciate that. However, for nearly it's entire run time, I kept wondering if I had seen this movie before, but that would be impossible. I then started thinking it was a remake of a foreign film I had seen. Then it hit me. Though not a foreign film, this is very similar in premise and plot to Welcome Home from 2018. Overall quality is roughly the same, though I did enjoy this one more overall.

I wished I had read some reviews first, but with 5.7 rating at the time, I thought it at least had to be okay.I almost always lose complete faith in a movie where everybody dies; it seems lazy and leaves the story without perspective. By the time 3/4 were dead with cold, detached climaxes (not a compliment), it was near enough to the end that I continued watching and telling myself 'well, one is better than none, and they still have to tie everything together...' but nope, the last character was gone even more unceremoniously than the rest.They continue to dangle the carrot of some answers to all the going's on to salvage the massive bottoming out of the film, but only waste more of the viewers time with glimpses of a routine killer performing the mundane.As a last ember of hope arises with video over the credits, I begrudgingly watched through the continued pointlessness that gave all the closure of a slap in the face.I wasted time to review this waste of time movie in hopes to save others from contributing theirs.This.

Once again it seems that neckbeards and basement dweller virgins are negative bombing something the Franco brothers, do out of envy.The movie begins with two couples on a retreat, the characters are genuine, in the sense that we all know people like this (if you have ever had college friends). The movie goes on threough their common and expected issues between couples and friends before it takes several twists and turns that leave you wondering where is this really going to go.After the troubles with the landlord we are left uncertain to his involvement in everything that's happening, and that's when we see the real antagonist, a serial killer who kills, if for nothing else, out of pleasure. This guy is no nonsense, he doesn't play with his victims nor does he take 30 mins to track them down (looking at you Jason Vorhees) and the best part is that, unlike every single other slasher and scary movie, this guy doesn't get killed by some random teens.We later see that this is a regular activity, his MO is shown to us throughout the credits while he takes on other victims.Being filmed, mugged, killed or just be subjected to any kind of danger is something that is always in the back of our minds when we go to a hotel or to an airbnb, Dave takes this fear and shows us the worst csse scenario.My only criticisms are first, that there are some scenes that feel too much like fillers, I feel that there could've been a bit more character development and second, some of the suspense sounds were a bit too much for me, it made it feel cheesy.",The Rental

I'll bet most of the people bagging on this film for ""lack of originality"" are the same people that'll watch every ""new"" zombie film with glee and can't wait to see another ""The Conjuring"" entry. Look folks, EVERY story, when broken down to its basics, has been done time and time again and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Sure, I can name many other films whose stories are essentially like this one, just as I can name fifty plus similar zombie films, and fifty haunted house movies, or vampire movies, or ghost story movies, or alien invader movies - all, at their core, basically like their predecessors. But so what? Date of origin has nothing to do with the quality of the product. Thank God filmmakers understand this concept or we'd have been deprived a ton of good films! For me, it's not the story that matters so much per se. Rather, it's how the story is told, and ""The Rental"" is told rather well, in this viewer's opinion.I also don't understand the comments calling the film ""pointless"" because of its ending. Why is knowing the killer's backstory so important for some in this instance? Sure, it could have taken that direction but instead they left it unexplained which, honestly, I found much creepier. Why did Ted Bundy kill? Why indeed. To me, evoking those sort of thoughts in the viewer IS the point. Too much criticism is given to films that don't wrap things up with a neat little bow and that's too bad. Certainly almost any ending would have its detractors; I'm glad the filmmakers had the courage of their convictions to end it the way they did. I'm not saying it was the greatest script in history, but it was more than unique enough to be entertaining.As for the production of the film, it was superb. The location was awesome. Loved the cinematography and art direction; they really set a dreadful and moody atmosphere. The directing was better than mere competence with some clever setups and good staging and execution. The cast and acting were top notch. I will admit that their motivations become morally suspect in the third act, but that has more to do with the script and not the acting itself. The performances themselves were great.I don't rate a lot of films on IMDb but felt compelled to write a review for this movie after seeing so many terrible reviews from others. For the life of me, I can't see why anyone would rate this anything less than 3 out of 5 stars. It's a solid thriller and I have no problem recommending it to others.

It's a movie that probably fits best into the home invasion category, but the on-screen violence is kept to a minimum. Instead, The Rental focuses heavily on building characters and their complicated relationships, so when the bad stuff starts happening, the characters' reactions feel more natural and understandable within the context of the movie.

Much like the recent Open House movie, this film prays on your worst nightmares of home and intimacy invasion. Even though the horror checks in at the last minute, some of the images are very disturbing and there is one 'Gotcha!' moment that took me about 2 feet off my sofa. People who berate the final quarter are simply missing the point. People do bad things for no reason. This stuff really happens, which makes it all the more effective (just like Dan from Downton's faultless Yank accent).

366,lindamokey-285-978722,Went downhill fast...,4,3 April 2021,"This movie had potential. There were some obvious horror tropes: deserted house, surly landlord, etc. You get to know the couples and the dynamic isn't so rosy. Infidelity happens, drug-taking happens, dogs disappear, a creepy locked room is discovered. There is a POV shot of someone watching the house and heavy breathing.Then things go downhill. The couples suspect they are being spied on...the jacuzzi conveniently breaks, necessitating a visit from the surly landlord, who promptly gets beaten senseless. They introduce a mysterious stranger, dressed in black, who finishes him off. The couples think it's their fault and try to throw the body off a cliff. Smart choice. Footage of the infidelity (which conveniently takes place in a shower that has a camera) flashes up on the screen, causing the scorned woman to flee and be killed by the mysterious stranger, who then sends texts luring her husband to her location. Guess what? He is promptly killed, too.The mysterious stranger, in a sfx old-man mask, polishes off the other couple, dismantles the surveillance system and starts to take off the mask, but...denied! The camera cuts away. You can tell the guy is young, though. His silhouette walks to the balcony and in runs the missing dog, who does the best acting in the movie, looking apprehensive and confused.Finally, the young mysterious stranger is being shown another glamorous home by a realtor, who gives him the keys. He makes a copy of the key and sets up the surveillance system. Then he waits on the couch with his old-man mask and black clothing on. As the credits come up, a montage of surveillance footage is shown: people watching TV, sitting on the toilet, cooking. Finally, a person is shown sleeping and the mysterious stranger suddenly runs toward the bed. Cue spooky music.There. I just saved you and hour and a half.",The Rental
367,indira2629,Sparks of originality but eventually more of the same!,4,13 August 2020,"The rental, is the debut movie of director Dave Franco, brother of James Franco. It has decent acting, a few cinematic shots, some original ideas based on which it was marketed. But as the movie progresses, the story becomes complacent and predictable.If the writers actually wanted to make points about race and the current culture of staying in other peoples houses as rentals... why go the already done route and make it a slasher? Instead I think race was just used as a check mark on diversity and add a layer into characters which clearly lacked any. It's like there were sparks of originality in the beginning but eventually succumbed to the tried and tested route of the slasher genre. Having characters with more nuance would have helped.
A critic actually compared it to a Haneke movie(I don't agree) but it brings up the point of how an effective movie actually builds on tension instead of releasing it. Maybe keeping the smaller sub points of race and relationships subtly woven into the story to add tension instead of being used as a distraction would have helped. Instead it feels like it started as a different genre but turned into a slasher. Building an atmosphere goes beyond just adding a few shots of natural landscape and a little foreshadowing. It has to be felt through the characters or else It's just surface level.
I wouldn't recommend it if you've already seen movies in the slasher genre and if you haven't I still wouldn't recommend it as there are better ones than this (see Hush)",The Rental

The movie ends with scenes of new couples waiting to be trapped and killed. Serial killing as some kind of career-choice. It's not ""shocking"" anymore - it's just starts to be a little repetitive. I'm beginning to long after the traditional endings where justice actually prevails. As always a lot of things could go wrong with these set-ups in real life. But in the movie-script everything runs smoothly according to the serial killers wishes. Of course.Besides above, it's a reasonably good run-of-the-mill movie in this genre.

If you are planning to watch this movie, just think back to the last movie you wasted two hours of your life watching and then go do something productive like clean your bathroom, bake a cake, or spray for ants. When I read the reviews for this movie, Ifeel like I live in an alternate reality where there are no decent movies being made. Perhaps I traveled through time and I am the only one that remembers what a plot is and it's no longer important to today's movie-goers. I think, ""What if no one remembers movies from my time.."". I grow sad, but then I realize that I can still access these movies with my special time travel dvd collection of amazing movies. I fear talking about these because if I am traveling through time, maybe I don't want people to know...reading this is probably making you scratch your head. That's what this movie left me doing...I heard Dave Franco wants to leave us guessing at the end because PLOT TWIST the dude doing the killing is a former renter. Wow! That had to take hours or seconds to come up with that brilliant storyline. Honestly, this gives me hope that all of my ideas for writing a script will be the next Harry Potter or Star Wars series of blockbuster movies.

It is a ""slow burn"" movie, but the ending was not worth the wait. The kills were too quick and short, and three of the four characters were killed within five minutes. The last one killed within the five minutes thereafter. Way too fast. The entire movie was drawn out, but the kills weren't at all? Oof.Also, the plot about the couple's affair took over and became cringy and awkward. I like character development, but the movie built on the two characters having an affair. Yes, the premise needed the ""footage"" of them, but the other two more likeable characters had little development, and so the audience is forced to only know the two having the affair. Yuck.Cinematography was okay, but in this day and age, that's basic. It's about the only thing that made the movie enjoyable. Otherwise, couldn't stand the movie.

There were clunky scenes where the characters tried to fill years of backstory in a single conversation.There were two very different, very distinct plotlines that never came to any sort of conclusion.We ended up with another faceless killer with no known motive other than the fact he loves to kill people in his spare time? There was a passionless affair that was disappointing considering the tension build.In short, this movie is about 4 very unlikeable who get murdered in a holiday home.

The characters make bad decisions, but unlike most other horror movies, their decisions are relatable and they have to face their bitter consequences.Warning, minor spoilers ahead...The movie blends the genres very well.On the one hand we have a slow burning psycho-thriller, on the other hand we get a almost classic slasher-finale.Especially the slasher part felt really original whilst being in classic-style.The great camera work makes the finale very tense and the realsim makes it feel very raw.After that the audience can cool down with an explanatory epilog.I don't get the low star ratings, as someone who has seen every horror movie with an imdb over 5 I can't imagine giving this less than 6*.But I can understand that this intelligent movie might be too much for some people.",The Rental

Given the movie is filmed in one location, with a limited cast, it maintains intrigue for its entirety. It was simplistic yet creepy and the plot tapped into the inherent human fear of being watched without ones consent; particularly in this day and age where not only are holiday rentals incredibly common but surveillance technology continues to get increasingly discreet. The acting was authentic and the plot presents some realistic and uncomfortable flaws in humankind. It wasn't overly cliche even if the hidden camera premise has been done before. The characters each had their own issues which contributed to the fall out and the ending was not predictable. Give it a watch if you like a good thriller.

The intensity of this film lies not in gore, but with good, old fashioned suspense. Not overly original, not a clone, a nice, solid standalone with a descent plot and a refreshingly clever twist on the character of the killer. I plan to buy this movie as soon as possible.

First half of the movie you wait for something to happen and it never delivers. The story is just bad. Sometimes the ending can redeem a bad movie but not this time. Might give this 3/10 for acting at least, but since the overall score is so high (5.8 atm), it has to be lowered so people don't think this is worth their time. Sorry Dave Franco, try again.

The ominous and tense tone will keep your attention and the acting is absolutely solid which is no surprise considering the actors are all very talented and have skills exceeding those needed to master this film's particular roles. The overall concept centers around a fear that is nothing new in horror/thriller films, however Dave Franco adds some fairly novel twists that makes this movie stand out.

502,manelsaobento,The Rental feels like a prologue to a much more interesting sequel...,5,8 August 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The Rental is Dave Franco's debut as both director and screenwriter of a feature film. Making a successful horror movie was never an easy task, but I believe it's even harder nowadays. This genre has evolved in so many ways by delving into distinct subgenres and helping new directors deliver brilliant horror stories. Of course, every year has dozens of awful horror films, and most of the ""Worst Movies of the Year"" lists possess more than one horror flick. However, I firmly defend horror is reaching audiences like never before, and I genuinely believe that it's a matter of time until a Best Picture award goes to this genre.So, is The Rental one of the better ones or not so much? Well, it's as ""okay"" as it can be. I find it hard to heavily criticize a film that doesn't really give me much to actually analyze. It's a straightforward story with barely any complexity. Four characters with clear yet generic motivations. Their relationships and how they handle each romantic bond is surprisingly the most interesting aspect of the movie. Still, besides being somewhat predictable, it seems more captivating than what it truly is because one particular screenplay element fails to deliver a compelling narrative.The main (and honestly, only) horror component of the story is no more than a hollow attempt at creating a franchise. Now, there's nothing wrong with teasing an overarching story in the first film of a saga, but if this tease plays the entire horror role, then the only feeling Franco is getting from the audience is disappointment. Viewers might look forward to jumpscares and creepy sequences, but if the questions the movie makes are left unanswered, chances are people will dislike the ambiguity.I'd be interested in a sequel because this first film creates a really intriguing mystery that I'd love to see developed and eventually solved. However, this comes at the cost of sacrificing the latter flick since it basically uses the whole runtime to introduce the overarching character/element. The Rental follows the usual ""friends in a vacation house where things are not what they seem"" formula, which doesn't really set up Franco as a horror director to follow closely. He shows a bit of skill, the uneasy atmosphere is well-established, and he lets the actors play off their dialogues without too many cuts, something I deeply enjoy.Technically, it's quite good, to be honest. It's a very dark movie, but I could see everything clearly, which is usually a problem in this type of horror film. The third act might be partially a letdown, but its execution holds the necessary tension and suspense. Dan Stevens and Sheila Vand deliver two great performances, showing remarkable chemistry. Alison Brie and Jeremy Allen White are also good, but the previous duo steals the spotlight. I wish it had more horror-like sequences, even though I appreciate the focus on the character's relationships and dynamics.All in all, The Rental is a clear attempt at creating a new horror franchise, and honestly, it partially works. If ""success"" means getting the viewers interested in a sequel, then mission accomplished. However, sacrificing the first movie of a possible saga to just introduce its main horror element doesn't quite work as Dave Franco might have thought. In his directorial debut, Franco focuses on the characters and their relationships, which are undoubtedly the most captivating aspects of the film, also thanks to a fantastic cast. Despite some neat technical attributes, the formulaic screenplay and its predictable developments are far from being entertaining enough to hold my attention. The dozens of unanswered questions definitely leave an open door to produce a genuinely compelling sequel, but this first installment will always feel more like a prologue than an actual movie. If you're just looking for a simple horror flick to spend your extra time, this one won't surprise you, but it might be a good, inoffensive Saturday night pick.Rating: C",The Rental
503,manuelkwecker,"Good direction, bad script, mediocre acting",5,8 August 2020,"The Rental is Dave Franco's directorial debut. What I thought would be a marketing move turned out to be a refreshingly competent first movie. The cinematography is great, and the movie doesn't rush shots, which I very much like. Some shots just linger, waiting to show something, not cutting away, not yet revealing the next information either. Direction and cinematography are seriously great. Sadly, the script and acting are not.Two couples go on a weekend-long trip away. At the rented oceanfront house, they discover that they are being watched.The idea isn't original, but it doesn't have to be. There are many movies out there that follow a simple or unoriginal premise, but still turn out to be great. ""The Rental"" is not one of these movies, despite my initial praise.The buildup takes a bit too long for my taste. I don't mind a slow burn, but this movie really takes its time. There's a tense atmosphere built throughout the movie. The slightly desaturated look, the dark music, the shots looking off into the grey distance, all convey a sense of dread.Then, there's the exposition. God, is it awful. The way information about the characters or their intentions are revealed, especially in the first half, is ridiculously bad.Speaking of the characters, they are really bland. The movie tries to give them distinct personalities, but fails to make any of them really likeable or interesting. Part of that is the writing, the other is the acting. Alison Brie does a good enough job with what she has to work with. Dan Stevens, Sheila Vand and Jeremy Allen White are between mediocre and bad. There is no chemistry. All relationships feel forced. The dialogue is mostly not believable.All in all, the great direction by Franco and cinematography by Christian Sprenger are let down by a bad script (also by Franco) and mostly mediocre acting. Given something better to work with, I am still looking forward to what Franco does next - maybe he should let someone else write for him and focus on directing instead. It could be a winner.",The Rental

The payoff at the end of the film can either be seen for what it is, an extremely smart twist leaving the classic teen horror trope behind, or as what a lot of reviewers want it to be, a bad take on a tired genre.Dave Franco's directorial debut starts as a classic horror movie, with a slasher character that borderline copies ""Halloween's"" Michael Myers, but where the movie takes a turn is when you learn our murderer has no vendetta against these teens, and just happens to find the airbnb a convenient method of finding serial victims.

508,kylekrozser,Third act ruins everything seen prior.,3,9 September 2020,"This movie starts off with a really good build-up, but it's completely wasted by a stupid final act.
The entire cast was dead before I realized they were actually killed off, rather than unconscious and returning later. The deaths were so quick and lazy, that I literally didn't know any of the characters had died until the credits started.Most of the beginning tension is regarding an affair between the couples, but once everything has been revealed, half of the cast is already dead. It makes the whole plotline and build-up seem pointless, as there is no 'big confrontation' or conclusion, despite the affair being the focus of the first 60 minutes. It just doesn't make sense, such a waste of time to start all of that and take it nowhere.The movie simply ends, and then you realize that was all it had to offer - pretty much nothing once the build-up and tension is ruined.",The Rental
