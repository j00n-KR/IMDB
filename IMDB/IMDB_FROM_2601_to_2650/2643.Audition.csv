0,MartinHafer,YUCK--Don't let your kids watch this one (or even yourself),2,20 January 2006,"It's very odd. Director Miike made perhaps my very favorite Japanese movie (HAPPINESS OF KATAKURIS) and the Japanese movie I hate most (this one). It's not that this movie is TECHNICALLY bad--the acting and production values are fine. It's just that the story goes from an apparently cute tale of a guy trying to pick up girls to a sick and twisted mess that adds absolutely NOTHING of value to my existence. I really wish I could get surgery that would ONLY remove the part of my brain that remembers seeing this horrific and just plain sick film. Do NOT let your kids see this, do NOT let Grandpa see it and DON'T EVEN LET BLIND PEOPLE SEE IT!!! This is a sick and sadistic piece of evil that is masquerading as ""art"". I am absolutely flabbergasted that so many of the reviews for this movie are positive---even glowing. Who could possibly like a film that ultimately is about a sick and twisted woman who dismembers people and drags them around in a bag!!!! Yup--that's the hidden secret of this film and I wish I had never seen it. It actually scares me that so many people like this type of film--I think I'm buying new locks for all my doors.",Audition
1,Leofwine_draca,One of the most disturbing films I've seen,6,14 October 2015,"AUDITION is a film I knew little about before watching - modern Japanese cinema is something I'm not very knowledgeable about and Japanese ""horror"" films even less so. I had heard about AUDITION being extremely dark, brutal and disturbing with some amazing twists during its cinema run, so out of curiosity I had to rent it. What I got was a mixed movie, sometimes gripping but definitely not one I would call ""entertaining"" to watch. For the first hour and twenty minutes, it's a slow-paced tale of romance with some mystery aspects which keeps you watching through some interesting, subdued direction from Takashi Miike. This gives the film its realistic edge, and it also incorporates some strong acting on the parts of the two leads; Ryo Ishibashi creates a portrait of a sad, lonely middle-aged man so that you have a ton of sympathy for his character and can relate to his desperation. In comparison, Eihi Shiina's almost unearthly look - there is something very fragile and beautiful about her - sits well with her mysterious and unexplained character whom nobody else in the film seems to know much about. Shiina is excellent in the role and deserves to go on to a big career in Japan.For the first hour and twenty minutes - normally the running time for a ""normal"" Western film - there isn't much horror here to tell about, other than a few flashy disturbing images of a severed tongue slapping on the floor, a man getting his head slowly and deliberately sliced off, and a great shock sequence involving a moving bag. Then, at around that eighty minute mark, the film begins to change and become colder and disturbing. Dreams are mixed with reality to create a visually confusing film and Miike delights in tormenting the viewer with a hideous image of a man in a sack with no feet and few fingers. You begin to wonder what the hell is going on, and then the films ends ambiguously making you wonder whether what you just watched really happened or not.Before that ending comes one of the strongest - in terms of physical torture - segments of a film that I've yet to see, which is tough to sit through. Basically it's a scene of a paralysed Ishibashi being slowly and deliberately tortured by Shiina, who delights in getting as much pain as possible from her victim. First via the use of strategically-inserted needles, and then in the film's most stomach-churning moment, she actually saws his foot off - in graphic detail. This is far stronger and darker stuff than many of the shoddy and amusing video nasties that were prosecuted in the early '80s, yet is released uncut today in Britain - it shows how much our society has changed. The realism of this sequence makes it pretty nauseous and you can't help but be grateful when it's all over. So did it really happen? I don't know, and I don't plan on watching this film again anytime soon to find out. It's very interesting stuff and highly disturbing, as well as being well-made, but an entertaining movie it is not.",Audition
2,claudio_carvalho,"Creepy, Disturbing and Realistic",8,31 May 2014,"In Tokyo, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a widower that grieves the loss of his wife and raises his son Shigehiko Aoyama (Tetsu Sawaki) alone. Seven years later, the teenage Shigehiko asks why his middle-aged father does not remarry and Shigeharu meets his friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura), who is a film producer, and tells his intention. However, Shigeharu has difficulties to approach to available women to date and Yasuhisa decide to organize a sham audition for casting the lead actress for the fake movie. They receive several portfolios of candidates and Shigeharu becomes obsessed by the gorgeous Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina). Despite the advice of the experienced Yasuhisa, Shigeharu calls Asami to date and he falls for her. But who is the mysterious Asami? ""Ôdishon"" a.k.a. ""Audition"" is a great horror movie with a creepy, disturbing and even realistic story but with less violence, weirdness and gore than the usual, for a movie directed by the Japanese director Takashi Miike. The characters are very well developed and the beautiful Eihi Shiina is perfect in the role of Asami. The scene when she says ""deeper, deeper, deeper"" is scary and remains imprinted in the mind of the viewer. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Audição"" (""Audition"")Note: On 21 March 2017, I saw this film again.",Audition
3,kosmasp,Kiri Kiri Kiri,8,4 December 2017,"After you watch the movie, you will understand my summary. I won't spoil that for you beforehand though. What I can tell you, is that the first time I watched this, I was completely bummed. It was the first Miike movie I saw and I probably just couldn't handle what I was experiencing. Upon the second viewing (more recently), I have to admit, the movie is pretty sick (multiple senses).There are still things that I think could be smoothed over or that are maybe a bit too weird, for a otherwise ""normal"" movie (at least until a certain point). Saying too much about the story or reading too much about it, might not really give you too many spoilers (it's hard to explain what is going on throughout the movie), but it is better to just experience it without too much reading into the movie. You can still do that after you saw it.This drama that turns quite sideways, but has hints of it being more than the drama you may expect our main character (single father) is about to have ...",Audition
4,gavin6942,"A Confusing, Yet Satisfying, Love Story With Horror Elements",8,21 August 2007,"A man loses his wife at a young age. Years later, his son encourages him to find a new wife. He holds an audition and finds a woman he believes to be absolutely perfect. But she might want more out of him than he's capable of giving her.Those who are familiar with Takashi Miike know hi mas a director who loves violence, excessive gore and plenty of torture and pain. And if you're like me, this film will surprise you in how little of these things you'll find and how strong a story there is in its place. There is torture, there is pain... but compared to other films, it's actually relatively mild. (Allegedly, people such as Rob Zombie found it excessive, but I don't see how this is possible.) I really enjoyed how rich and strong the plot was, and how much I found this refreshing for a genre so entrenched in blood and guts with little substance. Until the plot goes dark (well over an hour into the film), this could have been any drama you've ever seen (maybe ""sex, lies and videotape"").This film's biggest flaw, or perhaps it's strong point for some, is that it will leave you wondering what exactly you watched. I think the film is clear, but if there's a message, it's hard to say what it was. Some see a feminist message, while others see an anti-feminist one. Some see dream sequences while others do not. I have heard critiques that say this addresses Japanese culture as a whole, which I believe Miike denies. So, who really knows? Maybe it's best not to put too much thought into it.I need to see this again to really give a thorough analysis, but I strongly suggest you see it if you haven't. There's a reason Miike and J-Horror are growing in popularity (or at least were within the past five years) in America. I think this film might be a huge reason why. Good plot, strong characters, cultural relevance... and good old needle torture (though less disturbing than the needle torture in ""Imprint""). What more do you want?",Audition
5,jboothmillard,Audition,8,12 July 2010,"A little bit of me wished I didn't know the genre before watching this Japanese film, but the good news was I didn't when it was going to kick in, which made all the more difference. Basically company executive Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) has been widowed for seven years, his son Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki) is urging him to start dating again, and his film maker friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura) is concerned too. To try and find him a suitable bride, Yoshikawa is holding a bunch of female auditions for a fake film, and seeing all the photos and profiles, Aoyama has caught his eye on a ballet student. The auditions kick off with some amusing and interesting encounters, with odd questions being asked, and then the ballet student, Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) comes in. She seems shy and quiet, and Aoyama is so keen that he notes her phone number and quickly takes her to dinner to get acquainted, his friend warns him not to call her again. He avoids Asami a little while, worrying he may seem to eager, but he gives in to his need to call, and that is when you see Asami in a pretty empty room waiting for a certain amount of rings, and with a body moving in a bag. They start going out a lot again, and they seem to be getting closer the more they do, to the point when they are comfortable enough to sleep with each other. All of the sudden Asami disappears without trace, and Aoyama tries to rely on the very little information from her audition information form to find her, but most of the people don't know her properly. By the way, it is the point that the plot also dissolves in its linear sense, it is a bit all over the place, and you know you are in trouble when she does return. Asami does eventually come back, reveals the dead dog, and she jabs Aoyama with an injection that paralyses him, but he is still alert as she pricks the underneath of his eyes with needles and slices his foot off with a razor wire. There is a little confusion as to whether this was all a dream after making love, but it returns back again to see Shigehiko kick Asami down the stairs breaking her neck, and Aayoma (in pain don't forget) is sad. You believe for the first forty to fifty minutes or more that it is some kind of slightly naff romantic comedy, and it sort of is, and then as soon as the David Lynch style deliberate confusion sets it, it flips all together. Once you know that it has turned into a psychological horror thriller, it is some of the most shocking stuff you will ever see, it got a lot of walk outs and complaints at the cinema. All in all, with this unexpected turn of plot and genre change, and the unpleasant material (in a good way), this is definitely one deserved 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die entry. Very good!",Audition
6,Woodyanders,Positively terrifying,9,13 September 2007,"Successful, but lonely middle-aged businessman widower Shigeharu Aoyama (a superb performance by Ryo Ishibashi) lives with his loving son Shigehiko (affable Tetsu Sawaki) following the death of his wife. His loyal film producer friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (nicely played by Jun Kunimura) advices Shigeharu to remarry. The two guys hold an open audition for a nonexistent movie in order to find the ideal female candidate. Shigeharu becomes smitten with the lovely, polite and charming Asami Yamazaki (the mesmerizing Eihi Shiina). Shigeharu plans to wed Asami, but she proves to be a lot more than he bargained for: she's a deeply troubled and lethal psychopath with a grim past history of horrible abuse. Director Takashi Miike does an expert job of firmly grounding the macabre and unnerving story in a thoroughly plausible pedestrian everyday reality. It's this meticulous evocation of a totally believable mundane world which in turn makes the startling conclusion so shocking and upsetting; the characters and their lives ring true, so everything they do seems credible as well. Moreover, Miike handles the ghastly violence with admirable restraint and subtlety; he suggests more than he shows -- and this proves to be highly effective. The gradual pacing takes a little getting used to, but culminates in a chilling and disturbing conclusion that packs one hell of a potent and lingering gut punch. Hideo Yamamoto's sharp cinematography and Koji Endo's classy orchestral score further enhance the overall sterling quality of this scary and unsettling knock-out.",Audition
7,Tweekums,Audition,8,1 June 2014,"'Audition' opens with a man, Shigeharu Aoyama, at the bedside of his dying wife; seven years later his son suggests it is time he got married again. He doesn't actually know any suitable women but a friend has an idea; he will hold an audition for a film and Shigeharu can sit is and select a potential girlfriend! Having read through the applications one woman stands out; Asami Yamazaki. He is fairly uninterested in the interview process until Asami turns up then he quickly falls for her and is soon meeting her for dinner. His friend is unsure about her though; certain things she said are a little suspicious. Shigeharu isn't worried though and the relationship develops to the point where they go away together for the weekend. It doesn't go as planned though as she disappears while he is sleeping. He searches for her but nobody knows where she might be and any lead he finds comes to a sinister dead end. Soon his mental torment becomes physical and we have no idea if we are seeing his nightmares/hallucinations or what is actually happening.If you went into this film knowing nothing about it you may get a fair way through thinking it was going to be a romance, but as it progresses there are more and more hints that there is something slightly off with Asami. Then in the final act things get very unpleasant for Shigeharu and the viewers. What Asami does to Shigeharu is brutal in a way that is similar to the infamous hobbling scene in 'Misery' but much more gruelling. Ryo Ishibashi did a fine job as the rather ordinary Shigeharu and Eihi Shiina really shone as Asami; both when we are meant to think she is a rather quiet young woman and when we see the character is truly demented. Takashi Miike delivers the story in a way that draws the viewer into a pleasant romance before expertly turning everything on its head and giving us an ending that had this viewer watching through his fingers and turning the volume down a bit! Overall I'd recommend this to any horror aficionado but be warned it isn't for the faint hearted!",Audition
8,BA_Harrison,Miike's masterpiece.,10,18 April 2009,"When widower Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) decides that the time has come to remarry, his best friend, TV executive Yasuhisa (Jun Kunimura), organises a fake audition to enable the rusty romantic to interview an assortment of unsuspecting potential brides. Taking a shine to the pretty but shy Asami, Aoyama proceeds to woo the girl in a series of follow-up interviews, unaware that she isn't quite the innocent young thing she pretends to be.Although the above synopsis sounds suspiciously like the basis for your typical sappy Hollywood-style rom-com, nothing could be further from the truth: directed by Japanese auteur Takashi Miike, a man not exactly renowned for fluffy mainstream crap, Audition is actually an extremely audacious piece of cinema which gradually lures its audience into much darker territory before finally hurling them off the edge of sanity and into the mouth of madness in its closing moments.I don't wish to give too much away—most of the film's tremendous impact relies on its viewers being blissfully unaware of what happens in the closing moments—but rest assured, by the time the credits roll, those who have stayed the distance will have experienced one of the most original and shocking movies in the history of Asian cinema—and that is really saying something!",Audition
9,paul_haakonsen,Genuinely creepy,10,7 February 2010,"Be warned, this movie is definitely not for the weak of heart or spirit!This movie is all throughout brilliant. The way the story unfolds, the way it was shot, the characters, and the sets, all come together in one big unity.This was the first work of Takashi Miike that I ever saw, and I was immediately a fan of his work. This movie is twisted in so many ways, and twisted in a good way.For some, this movie might be slow moving at the beginning, but it will quickly pick up in pace. This is because the story is building up suspense, and doesn't just skyrocket off into space right away. The way it slowly builds up suspense, just adds to the scare factor and the creepy feel throughout the movie. Though I find it to be interesting and intriguing right from the beginning.The main characters are well performed and the personalities they are given in the script is amazing. The roles were cast perfectly and they deliver top performances in brining their roles to life. You get to go into the heads of the characters, almost as if you were there yourself.This movie is a thrill ride of genuine dread, and will have you curling your toes and glued to your seat throughout the entire movie. The movie will leave you in awe, as it did me. It really raises some questions about people you don't know and meet for the first time. Is what happens throughout the movie real or just figments of the guy's imagination!? I am not revealing more, but trust me, this movie is definitely one to watch. This movie left me thinking once it had ended. Not a lot of movies actually leaves me with an afterthought, but this one did. Which is good, it means there is depths to the story of the movie, and it is not just brainless entertainment or eyecandy.You will be picked up, slung into a bag, tied up, scared and then left begging for more. This is horror in its best form, a perfect mix of psychological thrills and downright mean torture.Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And it is one of the best movies, in my opinion, to have come out of Asia.",Audition
10,Quinoa1984,truly unnerving; one of Miike's most successfully harrowing,10,29 August 2006,"Audition is a near masterpiece, if not just that. It's Takashi Miike showing, at least here, how valuable he is in the current Japanese film industry. Whether you're repulsed by the film or not, it's hard to argue that Miike knows what he's doing with his style and quasi-grace with the subject matter. Unlike in the film of his I had seen previously, Ichi the Killer, this time he's more measured (if that's the word) in his style, as he sometimes leaves his camera long, pondering on their actions and movements. To say outright that it's a horror film in the traditional sense wouldn't be entirely accurate, even if it has a hand in some previous films about men involved with women who aren't 'quite right' like Play Misty For Me or Fatal Attraction. In the last half hour, of course, it really digs deep into such a surreal, cringe-worthy set of moments that are meant to push buttons and they do because of Miike's relentlessness with his style. He, along with Ichi cinematographer and editor Hideo Yamamoto and Yasushi Shimamura, define such a mood as to go beyond what would normally be in an exploitation picture. In the climax it's less about what torture is being done (though it is graphic to be sure) as how it's done, what thought process is behind it. This represents what has already built up as a sad story that (arguably) earns the right to suddenly go into the experimental, the strange, and the horrific.This is also assisted greatly by the performances. Ryo Ishibashi is very convincing at the start as a widowed man with a son who is fairly ordinary and running his business without much trouble. When he begins an audition with his business partner (Kill Bill's Jun Kunimara), he finds immediately a woman who intrigues him by what she (Eihi Shiina, the kind of actress with the right look and stark attitude the character absolutely requires) writes in her resume. Instead of an audition, it's a relationship that unfolds between him and her, and it leads to him almost proposing marriage to her. But after a night of tenderness between them where she says ""only you to love"" (which is amazingly lit in a beautiful blue hue), she's gone, and his search for her winds up in finding some things he shouldn't, and finally to the climax. But before that happens, what could be called a mind-f***er occurs through Miike going through what could be either a dream, a hallucination, or both, which leads up to that scene in Aoyama's house.3/4 of the film moves along with something of a convention in the center of it- a girl who the protagonist falls for (er, SHE is the heroine of the story, so to speak, as she later says) who might not really be right for her, even as he can't sense it. Individual moments in this part of the film end up speaking a lot for what psychological madness comes later on. The best example is right before Aoyama calls her again, as she sits in her home in a very odd, pained position, with a certain something in a sack in the corner, moving around. In a small way it almost says TOO much, and if one goes into the movie knowing there's something shocking will come later it might make one too prepared for it. But the genius of Miike's film, whether it might be seen as too twisting or manipulative or not, is how he sets it up then through this mix of dreams and hallucinations before the main shocker of the climax. These scenes are done full-force through the more particular choices given earlier in the film with lighting and editing, and it's a fine contrast between those brief, shocking moments, and then the real horror that befalls when the style goes back to 'normal' as it were. To put it another way, what is shown is just as compelling as what thought is in it, how meticulous and deliberate everything has become. It's not torture for its own sake like in Saw; one might really care for these characters, or at least feel a strong connection to.At the end, I sort of shook my head almost wondering what I had seen. A lot of the film speaks clearly to Miike being a truly gifted storyteller and controller of mood, though at the same time the sort of expectational whiplash sort of surprised me. In the climax I almost thought Miike would pull a twister ala The Usual Suspects, but then got pulled back into it again. It's in turns romantic and somber, gripping and deep, and it puts films like Misty and Attraction almost to shame in a way. And, of course, it IS a Miike movie, though a different bird than Ichi is achieving its goals.",Audition
11,Coventry,The ideal date movie!  Or maybe not?,9,25 October 2008,"Everybody faces this situation in his/her life sooner or later. You only just started a relationship and you are about to watch your first movie together. Personally you wouldn't mind a fair portion of violence and chills, but you suspect and worry that the other half prefers a slow and story-driven film with the emphasis on character development. But you needn't worry about this any longer, as Takashi Miike's ""Audition"" can perfectly satisfy both extremes. At least, theoretically speaking it can! This unforgettable and undeniable Japanese cult monument unfolds as a stylish and slow  better make VERY slow  moving romance drama, yet gradually but surely turns into a stomach-churning and nerve-tangling paranoia thriller with one of the most astonishingly engrossing climaxes ever captured on film. After seven years of living as a widower and devoting everything to raising his son, Aoyama wishes to remarry. A befriended movie-director wants to help Aoyama with meeting new women and arranges auditions for a non-existent movie. Aoyama immediately falls for the beautiful ex-ballet dancer Asami and carefully begins dating her. She's a beautiful young girl, but extremely introvert and mysterious. Aoyama's life subsequently turns into a psychological nightmare, yet the film's main strongpoint is how Miiki never fully reveals whether this girl is a lethal psychopath out for vengeance against the entire male race or that all the horror exclusively spawns from the protagonist's guilt and paranoid mindset. ""Audition"" is a truly strange and unique film. Miiki almost effortlessly seems to combine ambiances and elements that you always considered impossible to combine. At several moments during the first hour of the film, when the relationship between the two lead characters laboriously develops, you really wonder yourself how such a sober and melodramatic love story could possibly transgress into a reputedly shocking horror film, but it does! And how! The final ten-fifteen minutes are guaranteed to make you cringe and crawl in your seat and, I swear, you'll never look at a piano the same way again. I definitely also wouldn't advise this film if you already have a phobia for needles. Right from the opening sequences, Miiki effectively creates an intense atmosphere of depression and disturbance and maintains it throughout the entire film. He could also clearly rely on highly skilled and professional cinematographers, editors and production designers. The music is stupendous and the performances of both lead actor Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina are damn near perfect. This was Takashi Miiki's big international breakthrough achievement, and the least you could say is that he deserved it!",Audition
12,sunwarrior13,A Dark Japanese Classic Film,10,28 September 2011,"Audition is a story of a widower,Aoyama Shigeharu,who is a middle-aged president of a video production company, left alone with a teen-age son when his wife died seven years before. At his son's prompting, he finally starts to think about remarrying, but the method he chooses for selecting his potential bride is unusual, to say the least. On the idea of his friend Yoshikawa,he decides to hold an audition, using the excuse of a possibly-to-be-made movie to survey the female field. Looking at the resumes, he actually comes across one, from a Yamasaki Asami,that peaks his interest. The essay she wrote, relating the loss of her childhood dream (to study ballet) and the specter of death that she faced, shows a maturity the others do not. When it comes to the actual audition, Aoyama ends up ignoring most of the other women, and promptly calls Asami that night. They seem to hit it off well, with Aoyama eventually deciding to propose to her on a trip to the seashore, but after they sleep together, with Asami asking him to love ""only me,"" she suddenly disappears. His subsequent search for her only turns up grisly mysteries of missing men and dismembered bodies. It would be easy to turn Asami into some monstrous female man-eater, but the director, Miike, a veteran of many films about the marginal and displaced, is too concerned with those who don't fit in society to allow that. Dialogue early in the film equating catching fish to catching women emphasizes the violence of the audition and establishes, even with the sympathy we feel for Aoyama, that he is not free of guilt. This is the best horror film I have ever seen in world cinema.Better than those horror films whose goal is just to scare us.By the way,this movie is not for everyone for it is a dark film and more concentration is needed while watching this film. Highly recommended!!!!!",Audition

Wont you?,7,17 October 2015,"As the film lovers of the Western World clamoured for more Asian horror, along came Ôdishon (Audition), a one of a kind sort of pic. Its positive reputation is well deserved, though what negative press exists is certainly understandable.Run time runs close to two hours, and for ninety minutes of that time the film trundles along at a sedate pace. Director Takashi Miike is exploring the key characters, deftly providing an overlay of grief management, loneliness, sadness and even cruelty.There's a deliberately hallucinatory vibe to the narrative, with many thematic beats ticking away, though answers are not readily available, where both the lead protagonist and antagonist have blurry mindsets, or do they?It all builds to the Grand Guignol last quarter, where the film has gained its wince inducing rep.

14,Theo Robertson,Made My Eyes Water,6,3 November 2003,"I`ve often thought of the Japanese as being the most sadistic people on Earth . This goes beyond events of the 20th century like the rape of Nangkin , the Burma railway and the Bataan death march , but with that crazy contest show ENDURANCE where volunteers suffer great pain , possible maiming and even the outside chance of death in order to provide viewing figures for the audience back home . There`s even a Japanese TV show called RETALIATION which can best be described as "" BEADLE`S ABOUT meets GOODFELLAS "" . You`ll have to see it to believe it But what confirmed my views on the Japanese is this movie which is known in the west as AUDITION . I won`t go into the details of the plot but it involves a very graphic torture sequence , so graphic and skin crawling I`m sitting here totally amazed how I managed to sit through it , and the fact that it`s very well acted with a completely serious tone in no way exploitive  makes it all the more disturbing .

15,Hey_Sweden,A very powerful film.,9,7 July 2012,"Renowned filmmaker Takashi Miike proves here with this startling, intense film that art and horror can make good bedfellows. It follows no Hollywood formula, and Miike is not afraid to have it take its time. Of course, if one doesn't know it's a horror film, they may be unpleasantly surprised as it's the kind of film that creeps up on you slowly. Slowly, but surely. Ryo Ishibashi delivers a winning performance as Shigeharu Aoyama, a widower whose son gently encourages him to go looking for love again as it's been some time since the death of his wife. A friend, Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura) suggests that they ""audition"" potential mates by having them to come in to read for a part in a film. The one that intrigues Aoyama the most is the demure, pretty Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), who is slow to reveal that there is much more to her than meets the eye. Miike deserves credit for brilliantly interpreting the screenplay (by Daisuke Tengan) and for not making it clear where it's going from scene to scene, allowing us the audience to discover things along with Aoyama instead of being two steps ahead of him. Yoshikawa warns Aoyama that something about Asami doesn't feel right, and by the end we can see just how much baggage this disturbed young woman is bringing to the relationship. A constant sense of creeping unease prevails; the film is thickly atmospheric and full of haunting imagery. Some hardcore horror fans may find their patience tested before it's finally rewarded with a series of physical tortures, others will appreciate the deliberate pace and the overwhelming somber quality to the film. It starts off quite serious, before setting into a somewhat lighter groove, then introducing the horror elements with a vengeance. It's certainly got one of the all time great jump moments that can entertain a viewer even after they've seen it before. The acting is effective all the way down the line, with model & actress Shiina doing a tremendous job in a meaty role. In the end, this is fine horror entertainment that is provocative, intelligent, and truly unnerving at the same time, while giving us characters who both create troubles by not being completely straight with each other. The finale is an absolute corker. Nine out of 10.",Audition

Shigeharu reads lots of essays submitted by the potential leading actresses & one written by a young woman named Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) who compares the sadness & loss of not being able to become a ballet dancer in the same sort of way Shigeharu feels about losing his wife all those years ago. After seeing how beautiful Asami is in reality Shigeharu decides she would be perfect, although Yasuhisa has misgivings about her. Shigeharu phones Asami & starts to date her, however it soon becomes clear that Asami isn't quite as she appears...This South Korean & Japanese co-production was directed by Takashi Miike & personally didn't do a thing for me. The script by Daisuke Tengan based on a novel by Ryu Murakami is slow, boring didn't grip or engage me in the slightest & doesn't seem to want to explain itself. The character's aren't overly interesting & I didn't care for anyone. For over an hour virtually nothing happens & I mean virtually nothing, I can't remember being as bored as I was watching the first hour or so of Odishon in a long time. Odishon picks up a little bit after the hour mark as Shigeharu investigates the mysterious Asami & uncovers some shocking secrets but it doesn't last long & comes far too late. Even when the much talked about violence & torture I still found the whole thing totally underwhelming. I also hated the climax which seemed all over the place with flashbacks, dreams, hallucinations, stupid twists that don't work for a second & no real satisfactory resolution to anything, & to think I wasted 2 hours of my life to get to this non-event of an ending, very disappointing & frustrating. The scenes with Shiina being evil are very cool & are at least memorable as is the guy with three of his fingers & tongue missing.Director Miike films everything very blandly for the first half & Odishon looks like your average soap opera, during the second half where the weird stuff & violence kicks in Miike uses some colour filters, actually starts to move his camera about & throw in some nice angles. There is some brief nudity & sex while the violence is nowhere near as explicit as you may expect with the thought of what's happening more shocking than what is actually shown on screen. Someone has needles stuck in their body & one in their tongue, a severed tongue & some fingers, someone has their head sliced off, someone's foot is gorily cut off & well that's about it really. There are many, many much more gory films readily available if that's what your after & heard that Odishon delivers the goods, it doesn't.Technically Odishon is bland & forgettable, it's well made for sure but nothing stands out. The acting is OK & I've no real complaints here. Shiina makes for an incredibly attractive & sexy psychopath & is probably the best thing about Odishon.I just don't see why Odishon is so highly thought of, it did absolutely nothing for me. All I want from a film is to have fun & be entertained, Odishon didn't do either of these things & frankly just bored me rigid. I appear to be in the minority as many people seem to like Odishon but I can't in good heart recommend this film, after hearing such good things about it I can feel only nothing but disappointment.",Audition

19,Boba_Fett1138,Originality really makes this movie.,9,23 July 2011,"There is really one thing that truly makes this movie and that is its originality. The movie is unlike any other one, even if you are already familiar with Takashi Miike's style of film-making.The movie is still an unusual but not as strange as you would expect perhaps from a Takashi Miike. While its different it still remains a perfectly accessible movie for everyone to watch. The movie is more unusual with its build up this time, which at the same time is also the main reason why this movie is such an original one to watch.The first half of the movie is pretty usual and straightforward, as long as you can call a Takashi Miike movie normal and straightforward. It's interesting to see the movie slowly developing and heading into a direction you didn't expected to. It's therefore best to watch this movie without knowing too much about it, though that's quite hard, since this movie is being quite a popular and well known one by now.What seems as a drama soon turns into an horror. This is a transition not used too often in movies, at least not as subtly and slowly as it got done in this movie. The second half of the movie can be experienced as real stomach turning to some, while the lovers of 'torture porn' will have plenty to enjoy. It's some real extreme stuff, that obviously also really inspired some Hollywood horror film-makers such as Eli Roth and James Wan. So yes, you could actually say that it's thanks to Takashi Miike (or you could blame him for it, depending on your taste) that we now often get to see so much extreme violent and graphic stuff in horror movies. The sort of stuff that is now often referred to as torture porn.But calling this movie just torture porn really wouldn't be fair. It's way more than that. The movie has plenty of substance and above all things is really skilfully made, with lots of attention to detail. It might very well be Takashi Miike's best directing job he ever did on any movie. Watch this movie again and you'll realize how brilliantly and subtly the movie got all put together.This movie is a real surprise!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Audition
20,view_and_review,Ending picks up entire film,7,8 July 2021,"""Audition"" is a slow-moving ""horror"" that doesn't gain traction until the last half hour or so. That's not to say that the first hour-and-a-half is a bore, it's just not as compelling as the last half hour.The audition that is referenced in the title is an audition of women as potential mates for Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), a widower looking to find another wife. The audition was staged by Aoyama's friend Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura), a TV exec. He set up the audition as though the women were auditioning for a TV role when in fact they were auditioning for a date. Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) outshined all the other women in Aoyama's eyes. Little did he know, she was crazy. When Aoyama got intimate with Asami she pulled off her mask and showed how crazy she really was.The movie ended on a high note, especially if you like psycho women doing psycho women stuff. As I mentioned already, the movie was OK for the most part, even if it was a tad slow, but the ending really picked up the entire film.",Audition
21,evanston_dad,Has Much More to Say Than Hype Would Have You Believe,7,24 April 2006,"There are about 15 minutes of ""Audition"" that everyone remembers and talks about, and about 95 minutes of movie that you'd think didn't even exist if you listened to others' comments. But this is the director's fault; when you set out to shock your audience as much as Takashi Miike does in this film, you can't blame the audience if all they remember about your film is the shocking part.Which is a shame, because ""Audition"" is quite a bit more than a mere horror movie. It's really more of a feverish psychological drama along the lines of a David Lynch film. In fact, in structure and tone, this film reminded me of Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive,"" and if Lynch didn't have his own unique style and brand of film-making, I might wonder if he was inspired in part by this film when he made his own.What other comments here have done nicely is summarize what ""Audition"" is ""about."" A man (Shigeharu Aoyama) mourning the loss of his wife looks to find the perfect woman to replace her, and he holds bogus auditions for an ostensible film role in order to find her. But the girl who catches his interest (Asami Yamazaki) turns out to be a much better actress than he bargained for. What other comments DON'T necessarily convey, however, is how much of this film takes place in the world of dreams, and how blurred the line between reality and fantasy is. This dilutes the violence of the film's final moments, because there is a strong suggestion that this violence is taking place in the protagonist's nightmares.Is ""Audition"" a critique of the confined roles women are forced to inhabit in Japanese society? Is it about Aoyama's guilt in feeling the need for a woman to replace his dead wife? Is it about his fear of finding a girl that actually can replace her, thereby diminishing what he had with her? Is the film about the extent to which all relationships are ""auditions,"" where each person involved makes him/herself vulnerable and exposes him/herself to acceptance or rejection at the whims of another? A case can be made for its being about all of these things.When the violence comes at the end, it's not as graphic as the hype would lead you to believe. Even so, I wish Miike hadn't pushed the envelope quite so far. One has to wonder if the emotional impact of the film would have been any less just because the violence was less graphic, and I suspect the answer to that is no. The violence feels gratuitous and cheapens slightly everything that comes before it. It mars the film, but fortunately it doesn't ruin it.This is far more of a thinking man's film that its reputation would lead you to believe. Those who come to it for the titillating shock of its gore are bound to be disappointed.Grade: B+",Audition
22,Uriah43,A Bit Bizarre,6,21 February 2013,"""Shigeharu Aoyama"" (Ryo Ishibashi) is a widowed producer for a movie company who finally realizes that he isn't getting younger and seeks out a potential wife. His friend, ""Yasuhisa Yoshikawa"" (Jun Kunimura) convinces him to hold an audition for an actress to play a part in a fictional film so that he can interview prospective candidates to possibly wed. After reading one particular resume he becomes intrigued by a specific candidate named ""Asami Yamazaki"" (Eihi Shiina) and asks her out on a date. Rather than spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it I'll just say that things begin to happen after this. Anyway, I enjoyed the first half of the film but things seemed to get a bit bizarre after that and everything tended to go downhill at that point. I think part of the problem was the way the director (Takashi Miike) chose to downplay a couple of scenes which would have made the film more satisfying and opted for a more artistic approach in other scenes which didn't really need it. For example, the love scene between Shigeharu and Asami could have been a bit more passionate and should have been amplified. On the other hand, the flashback scene only served to make everything a little more confusing and probably didn't need to be filmed in the manner it was. Even so, overall this was a good movie and I thought Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina did excellent jobs in their respective roles. Definitely worth a watch.",Audition
23,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Tomorrow's heroine, is living just like you today.""",10,24 April 2020,"Despite having become aware of him from all the praise I've read for the title,I somehow have never got round to catching one of auteur film maker Takashi Miike's most famous works. Seeing a recent Arrow Easter sale taking place, a pal kindly Tweeted movie reviewer Ross Miller to ask what Arrow releases he'd recommend,one of which was this movie. Leading to me finally going for a audition.View on the film:Continuing to build on a occasional collaboration that began with the thrilling Fudoh: The New Generation, (1996-also reviewed) auteur director Takashi Miike & cinematographer Hideo Yamamoto make the opening audition process be one which marks where Miike began,and where he finished the decade,as Shigeharu's auditions cut between film, and a first person view of a rolling video camera (the format Miike started his career on.)Seeping the bad blood that is soon to reach the surface in their relationship down the wall, Yamamoto and Miike wire a white-hot tense atmosphere by hanging on flat, understated, wide-shots,which are pinned on a descent of Asami's starry eyes and Shigeharu's original casual gaze at the relationship. Reuniting with his regular editor of the era Yasushi Shimamura,Miike takes the lingering in the air breakdown of Asami and Shigeharu relationship, and jabs it with gloriously extreme violence on body mutilation (a recurring Miike motif.)Slicing it away from being a mere gore fest, Miike and Shimamura bring psychological meaning to the violence, via the inter-cutting flashbacks to the childhood memories (a major recurring theme of Miike's) of Asami, whose haunted memories of the abuse she suffered that continued into adulthood, injects her as a avenging angels to all the men who exploited her.Hired to adapt Ryu Murakami's novel by the studio as they looked for a project to get the Ringu (1998) crowd in, the screenplay by Daisuke Tengan brilliantly surges from Comedy to J-Horror with a razor-sharp skill. Murakami holds Shigeharu's jokey ""auditions"" for a new partner,with having a underlying creepiness, from the dismissive way he treats all the woman auditioning, which comes to haunt him, in the excellent, elusive dialogue Tengan gives Asami, which threads Shigeharu to playing a investigation into her past.Encouraged by his son to do these auditions after he has become a widow, Ryo Ishibashi gives a refine, considered turn as Shigeharu, whose grief Ishibashi has weighs heavy on him, bringing out pure fear when Shigeharu eyes the different state Asami sees their relationship in. In only her second credit, former model Eihi Shiina gives a hypnotic turn as Asami, thanks to Shiina getting under the fragile outer appearance of Asami, to unveil a fiery hole that needs to be filled with vengeance, that lands Asami a audition.",Audition

This is absolutely not a masterpiece whatsoever, it's just an average Japanese horror movie/drama. It all starts very slow and you get a little bit bored. And then when it finally gets a little bit more interesting with the torture the movie doesn't really make any sense. It's not that it's badly filmed or that the actors are bad, it's just not good enough to be categorized as an exceptional movie, and certainly not a masterpiece like some wants to make us believe here.

I see that my original video review was favourable but slightly muted and maybe that's because of the fairly slow build. Sensational second viewing though and possibly now more appreciative of Miike's unique way of being able almost effortlessly to make something ordinary become sinister and then very dark indeed. The film is leisurely to start with but even if this is the extraordinary Takeshi, it is still a Japanese film after all. Difficult last half hour and even as we watch through our fingers he has the audacity to have false endings and play with dream vs. reality.

What he gets is not what he expected. A clean, crisp, and highly stylized shoot, the first half of the film is pieced together one piece at a time, building curiosity more than suspense. In the denouement, however, the film breaks up and scatters, losing coherence in a sort of macabre, grisly, and frenetic montage. For many that will serve as a more than adequate dose of horror. For others, it will cheapen the result for there is no terror greater than that which can be perceived as real. It is difficult to have realistic perceptions when looking through a kaleidoscope of gruesome imagery. Horrific stuff for horror film buffs.",Audition
29,Red-Barracuda,Deeper...deeper...deeper...,9,17 August 2014,"A TV producer Aoyama sets up auditions for actresses to test for a film. Or so he tells them. What he really intends to use them for is to find a candidate to be a potential wife. His deceitful enterprise ends up with him selecting Asami, a shy and seemingly perfect, delicate girl. But it transpires that she is the spider and he is the fly.This Japanese horror film has garnered something of a cult following over the years and it's not hard to understand why. Its reputation is probably mainly on account of its final half hour in which it enters the realms of the torture film. Seeing as it was made in the late 90's it was somewhat ahead of the curve in terms of the subsequent boom in sadistic horror films that were in vogue in the mid 2000's. But it would be a bit unfair to simply focus on this aspect of Audition as much of its effectiveness is a result of its slow brooding build-up and some of its scariest moments are not visceral at all. Take the scene where Asami sits crouched on the floor of her darkened apartment. It's implied she has been sitting like this for days as she waits for a phone call she knows will come from Aoyama. When it does a frightening, cold smile crosses her face and a large canvas bag lying close to her suddenly spasms violently and rolls across the floor. It's a truly sinister and disturbing moment that gives so much information in such a simple way. It marks a turn in the film tonally and alerts the audience that something is terribly wrong. It's a genuinely classic moment of horror cinema.Similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), the main character in Audition is a man with a dubious objective and dark obsession with a woman. This story aspect adds an unusual dynamic to proceedings, as he is the victim yet has been deceitful and underhand so is not entirely sympathetic while Asami may be the villain yet she has a genuinely tragic back-story and is a strangely sympathetic psychopath. These layers of greyness simply add depth to proceedings and raise questions for us in the audience. All of the loose ends between the characters are tied up in a nightmare-like surreal sequence before the final gory showdown. In this dreamlike segment we learn many details and many strands of the story are linked together in strange ways. It's a bravura sequence of cinematic brilliance. Immediately after it we are given no respite whatsoever and are confronted with the true nature of Asami's vengeance in a very tough final act of clinical sadism. It's a chilling end to a hallucinatory film.",Audition

Sure, it came out 17 years ago, this is my first/only viewing, I've seen so much gore in my life (movies in movies, that is) and yet, this is practically Rated PG. Well, after watching two straight nights of Asian carnage cinema: Ichi the Killer (★★★★★/10 Stars) and Dream Home (★★★★★★★★★/10 Stars,) I was recommended Audition to fall into that category and from what I was told, I agreed. Never saw it, always meant to and this would be a great trilogy in as many days to finish off with.So, with these expectations, I relished in the first 20-30 minutes that seemed so normal, so cute and so good. I saw it as a lighthearted, romantic comedy/drama that was a little refreshing from the previous two movies I watched recently. But, boy did I smile. I was waiting patiently for the big bomb to hit, the huge scare that would make me jump since it was ""supposed to"" get extremely violent/bloody soon.40 total minutes had passed. Then, 60. 80. And at about 100 minutes, we're still in the same sweet, built-on-a-lie love-lost story. Sure, there were hints throughout this isn't what it seems. In fact, they flat out and verbally tell you that. So, I knew I was watching the right movie, but I began to question the whole ""goriest movie ever!"" statement/reviews I've heard during the almost two decades since its debut.Sure enough, the last 20 or so minutes, it gets somewhat gruesome. Nothing for me to look away from the screen, which I did a ton in 2001's Ichi the Killer. (Yeah, yeah, I can only take so much. Anything to do with teeth or eyeballs are off-limits for my own eyeballs.) Not a second did I say to myself: ""Well, this is from 2000, maybe it was considered gory back then "" Nope. I've seen plenty that had 10x the gore and all-throughout the movie – not just in the last act. That all said, the movie I saw (minus the exploitative 20 or so last minutes) was so cute, charming, well-acted and shot, it's overall recommended. Plus, the final third of the movie isn't bad on its own. It just certainly doesn't live up to the hype. ***Final thoughts: The bridge movie in my ""trilogy of terror"" is the best: Dream Home and the only Asian one shot outside of Japan. If you like Asian dark humor, suspense, blood and guts, that's the Home to move into.",Audition
31,bensonmum2,A Masterpiece,9,30 May 2005,"Every once in a great while, you stumble upon a movie that you immediately know is a masterpiece. I had read what other people had written about Audition, but didn't really believe all the hype. Surely it couldn't be as good as people claimed. After seeing Audition for the first time, I simply cannot get the film out of my mind. I doubt I can come up with enough glowing adjectives to describe the movie - disturbing, fascinating, brutal, engrossing, etc. It is quite simply on of the best movies I've ever seen. Fortunately, I knew very little about Audition before I watched. The final 30 or so minutes blew me away. I'm not going to go into detail as this would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just be prepared for one of the most shocking endings you'll ever likely see.The plot starts out as something right out of a Hollywood romantic-comedy. A middle-aged man wants to find a new wife. A producer friend of his sets up a series of bogus movie auditions as a way of meeting women. Does it sound enough like typical Hollywood tripe? The man meets the woman of his dreams. Or is she? What dark secrets does she hide? Watch and be amazed.The acting is first rate. The two leads, Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina, are both excellently cast. Ishibashi comes across as a sympathetic figure who simply wants a companion. Shiina's performance is excellent as the seemingly demure woman with a hidden secret.Takashi Miike is certainly a director that can be mentioned with the greats of the genre. The images he presents may be difficult to watch, but they aren't easily forgotten. Cinematography, editing, lighting, and the use of dream sequences are all first rate. Since I watched Audition, I've read numerous complaints about how slow the first part of the movie is . While it may seem slow to those more accustomed to Hollywood films where somebody is killed or something is blown-up every five minutes, the slow pace is absolutely necessary to increase the shock value of the end. Miike knew what he was doing.There are any number of ways to interpret the film. I'm sure that with subsequent viewings, I'll look at the events the movie presents in a different light. There's a lot here to take in during one viewing. I'm almost positive that I'll change the rating of Audition to a 10/10 after a second viewing.",Audition
32,paul2001sw-1,"The horror, the horror!",8,30 May 2004,"Art-house horror flicks are not a very common genre (few come to mind except 'Don't Look Now') but Takashi Miike's film 'Audition' is a welcome addition to the canon.  Beautifully shot and orchestrated, it is both a subtle personal drama and one of the most genuinely horrifying things I have seen. The early stages of this film resemble a work by Claude Sautet, only seen through a Japanese sensibility, about the relationship between an older man and a beautiful young woman, but there's something slightly discomforting both in the man's definition of the perfect partner, and in the person he finds who fulfills it. The story slides into first a mystery, and then a full blown horror story, the power of which comes from following a very simple golden rule: namely, make the audience care about the characters first: one small needle can be very very scary if you think that it's for real. And by keeping the meaning ambiguous (unlike, say, 'The Shining', with its self-defeating collapse into hyperbolic mania), the film also retains its impact after the initial shock.This sense of ambiguity is also crucial to the film's claims to be something more than simply an unorthodox gore-fest.  'Audition' constructs, and then deconstructs, a certain vision of the world and the ""horror"" scenes are only part of this.  The result is utterly beguiling,  and one can even see similarities with Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' in 'Audition's' portrayal of a man's complicit relationship with hell.In some ways, this is not a universal film and I could not imagine it working in English: can you envisage any Western actress speaking the Eihi Shiina's lines with a straight face?.  Whether that's because the film is saying something profound about Japanese culture,  or whether the fact that it appears to do so can finesse the issue for foreign audiences, I'm not sure.  Dramatically, 'Audition' is, despite its climax, not the best film ever made.  But atmospherically speaking, it's a masterpiece.",Audition

He meets Asami Yamazaki, a virginal dressed-in-white young girl who he discovers soon has a past of family abuse. Slowly the film descends from the urban mid-class family movie into pure horror, with a directing hand so sure it would not shame Hitchcock.It is the last part of the film that becomes extremely violent, but we are left with at least two alternatives into finding an explanation of the nature of the graphical horror we see on screen.

Well, yawn, this was uninteresting. Boring to be precise, to be more blunt. There were characters here that had no purpose whatsoever. Character actions were questionable. And the final act's non-linnear storytelling is so confusing that I had no idea what was actually happening, what was a dream, or visions. The film in general didn't make any sense. There's no explanation for Asami's character. Is she possessed? Is she a demon? Is she merely a figment of imagination? What???The final 15 minutes were so gross, it was almost unwatchable.

A clear narrative structure where the story builds up the tension and releases all hell within it's harrowing climax. And what an ending! I can deal with Asami's torture methods. I've got that down. What I could not comprehend was just one scene. I shan't spoil it, but it does involve vomit. I've never seen anything quite like it. Scarred for life. Too much detail. My eyes. They are bleeding. What was left of my innocence, has now dissipated. The context of the story and its purpose are well explored and described. Portraying how rich greedy men view women as just objects. The beauty of this horrific nightmare, is that the character who was truly in control was Asami herself. She is able to manipulate his mind. Sure she has issues as a person, I won't deny that. But it's refreshing to see that the male protagonist is the vulnerable character. It works on so many levels. Takashi Miike's direction was interesting to observe. A variety of different camera techniques to convey control and power in the blossoming relationship. Aoyama always looks at the camera whereas Asami consistently looks down on the floor, POV shots to increase suspense, long stationary shots to let the characters interact...and then skewed angles for the nightmarish climax. Speaking of said ending, I do think it becomes slightly too crazy too quickly. The build up was exceptional, masterfully crafted with an unnerving undertone throughout...and then it happens. As if Miike knew that time was depleting so he had to quickly wrap it up. I did find the first two acts occasionally slowed down to a halt but the pay off is what we wanted, and it delivers. Needles, wires, drugs, clamps...Asami is well equipped!",Audition
37,marmar-69780,Audition,8,26 August 2020,"Audition is one good Japanese horror that has some chilling and worthy moments in it.It isnt my favourite of their films but it still is a very strong female empowerment movie with some strong feminism messages that arent as annoying as they are today.Our lead male character was very likeable and i found myself caring for him,story was also very inspiring in a way but it also had a very good dose of unsetteling moments and some twisty and quality turns in it that were used in a good way,Audition was a good psychological horror film that shows how far revenge can lead us and how people that didnt do nothing to us can still suffer because of it",Audition
38,jtindahouse,A strange ride culminating in a pretty unforgettable and unique ending,8,18 June 2021,"1999 was a hard year for me to pick a movie from. Unlike in previous years where it's been hard to pick one because I don't really want to see any of them, this time there were too many that I wanted to see. I had wanted to see 'Audition' for a long time though, ever since Quentin Tarantino gave it his ringing endorsement, and so I settled with this one. It was an interesting film to say the least.Torture scenes in a movie are such a strange thing. They can be reasonably easy (and even enjoyable) to sit through I find if you determine that the character deserves the punishment. However, if the character does not then it's a whole other story. That's one of the reasons I have mixed feeling about the ending of 'Audition'. I felt like I missed something along the way, but from what I've read from other's perspective of the film I didn't. The final 15-20 minutes of this film is off the wall bonkers. It has to be seen to be appreciated.The majority of this film is very different to what I expected it to be. It's a real slow-burn. That whole portion of the film is done with so much class though that I didn't even mind. The dialogue, acting and direction are all top-notch. This is a strange and at times brutal film that is certainly not going to be to everyone's liking. If you think you're game though give it a try. It's very well made if nothing else.",Audition
39,billcr12,Sick but Good,8,24 July 2012,"Audition is in a category with Saw and Hostel, but much better. Aoyama had been a widower for seven years when his seventeen year old son convinces him to find a girlfriend. What a nice boy with such good intentions. Well, well, well; what begins as a sentimental and romantic drama, turns sadistic and vicious as it rolls along.A friend of Aoyama who is a film producer comes up with the idea to set up fake auditions in order to find his buddy a girl. He meets Asami, a beautiful young woman who claims to have been a ballet dancer who had to quit, due to an injury. Her resume is very mysterious and a former employer has disappeared. Asami lives alone in an apartment with a phone and a burlap sack on the floor. She sits on the floor for four days, waiting for a call. When the phone finally rings, the sack moves, and we hear gurgling sounds.Aoyami dates Asami a few times and they stop at a motel and have sex. She tells him of being abused and shows him some scars on her body. The next morning, she is gone. He uses her resume, but no one knows where she is. He find a man with prosthetic feet who has the same name as her childhood abuser. The bar where she worked has closed and the owner was found dead and cut into pieces, with three extra fingers, tongue, and ear nearby.Asami goes to Aoyami's house and is angered by a photo of his late wife. She drugs a liquor decanter and hides in a closet. Now it gets really sick, as a flashback shows the guy let out of the sack, missing fingers, an ear, and his tongue. He begs for food, and Asami throws up in to a dog dish, and he eats it. Oh, it gets better, as the crazy woman injects her man with a curare type drug to paralyze him. She sticks him with needles and cuts off his left foot(not to be confused with the fine, My Left Foot), and explains the need to be loved completely by her man. I was somewhat disappointed with the last part of Audition, but overall I liked it a lot, in spite of the graphic nature of the violence.",Audition
40,Polaris_DiB,Deeper and deeper and deeper...,7,27 November 2005,"Okay. I usually try to avoid making comparisons to other movies in my reviews, but talking about this film in context to Ichi the Killer will help me be more clear about what I'm trying to say.When I saw Ichi the Killer, I was stunned by how well everything added up into an insanely exciting climax that is honestly one of the best pieces of cinema I had seen in a while. When I read the synopsis of this film, Audition, I was expecting that it would be even more intense because it would be a more personal accumulation into sadism and psychotics than the public gang-brawl exposition of Ichi the Killer.And I was disappointed. Whereas this film does go in directions that seem incredible and amazing (and very, very uncomfortable), said directions don't really seem to have a purpose. I mean, she's a sadist and the subject of an abusive life, but what are we supposed to do with it besides the little bit of what's there? This film doesn't really end, it just kind of gets it over with and then dies down. I was expecting a lot more from it.This isn't to say this film is completely terrible or even bad. It's very finely crafted and for most of the lead-up is very exciting. The knowledge of what's to come makes it terrifying, and I don't even want to think about what this movie would be like without knowing what's going to happen--possibly traumatizing. Yet it eventually left me unsatisfied.Miike is an amazing director and an awesome visual artist. His work with sadism is like the Asian version of Cronenberg, at least that's as best a comparison as I can think of right now. By all means, watch this film if you can... just I'd strongly recommend experiencing Ichi the Killer instead.--PolarisDiB",Audition
41,dee.reid,"""Audition"" - A Perfect Nightmare Come True",10,29 November 2009,"Japanese gore maestro Takashi Miike made his international breakthrough ""Audition"" in 1999, and no doubt the reputation the film has amassed since its release is well-deserved. I had to take a deep breath a few moments afterward, and a few moments of reflection to think about what I'd just seen after I was done watching it. This is a movie that you're not likely to forget anytime soon. ""Audition"" is so deceptively innocent in its first half with the blossoming of a moving but tentative romance, that you almost forget, that first and foremost, this is a horror movie, and a damn frightening and shocking one, too.An adaptation of the novel of the same name by Ryu Murakami and using an original premise that also borrows elements from torture porn movies, slasher movies and a little bit of ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987), ""Audition"" concerns a lonely middle-aged widower, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), who takes the advice of his film producer friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura) and teenage son Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki) to hold a fake audition for a leading lady in a new movie. Out of the 30 potential young ladies applying for the position, Shigeharu is immediately smitten with the cute and demure but also mysterious and silent Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), a former ballerina with a dark past. The two go out on a few dates, but soon the blossoming romance between them becomes a freakish nightmare of unspeakable evil that neither one of them could have ever expected.This is not a film for the squeamish. Earlier this year, I had the great fortune to stumble upon the French horror film ""Martyrs"" (2008), which I have no doubt was seen by that film's director, Pascal Laugier, and it in turn served as an influence on his own film. Like ""Martyrs,"" ""Audition"" is not something to be played with. Also like ""Martyrs,"" you don't just watch ""Audition,"" you experience it. And also like ""Martyrs,"" ""Audition"" is not a film - it's an experience, one that will knock you out of your seat with a one-two punch combo. This is a grueling and shocking masterpiece of modern horror that begins so deceptively innocently before plunging into darkly uncharted waters.""Audition"" is an extremely well-acted and gripping film. I was pretty much sucked into it from the get-go. One of the great things about Miike's direction is how well he keeps you guessing about where it's all going to go, since the horror elements of the story don't begin until at least an hour into the picture. Until then, you have to deal with the romance between Shigeharu and Asami, which is touching to say the least (but full of red flags - love is blind, you know), but even then you kind of suspect about what's going to happen eventually and when it does, your eyes are glued to the screen in utter terror.""Audition"" was a pretty shocking and controversial film upon its release, which I'm sure only helped to serve its reputation as word of it spread across the globe. The violence in this film is quite shocking, graphic and grotesque to say the least, and I'm sure ""Audition"" may have helped influence the rise of the torture porn sub-genre of horror in the United States and Europe in the early 21st century.No doubt a masterpiece of modern horror movie-making, Takashi Miike's ""Audition"" is one for the ages.10/10",Audition
42,FilmCriticLalitRao,Audition:Japanese writer Murakami Ryu teams up with director Miike Takashi to create a chilling horror film.,8,9 May 2013,"For ""Audition"",one of Japanese cinema's most prolific directors Miike Takashi has teamed up with Murakami Ryu, one of Japan's most known writers. Their artistic collaboration depicts what happens when one does not pay attention to a close friend's advice. As a feature film ""Audition"" is a mix of three different genres-partial comedy, partial drama and partial horror. Director Miike Takashi has been able to merge these three different genres in his film as the actual horror scenario comes somewhere near the end. This gave the director a chance to include two other genres in his film.The drama part is important as it helps the viewers to have a better idea about the affable father/son relationship in Japanese society. Comic scenes in this film are nice as they manage to retain their unique quirky charm. These comic scenes fit perfectly well in the actual scheme of organizing a fake audition which is a great exercise in revealing obscure facets of Japanese women and their innocuous idiosyncrasies. One close look at these women tell that they would be willing to go to any length in order to get a role in a film.As far as the horror element of this film is concerned, hardcore horror cinema viewers must be warned that it is not an ""Evil Dead"" type of film.Lastly, Audition is strictly an ideal film for those viewers who would like to watch an atypical horror film made by one of the most productive Japanese director-Miike Takashi.",Audition
43,parry_na,Big spoilers follow ...,8,2 May 2016,"Seven years after the death of his wife, Shigeharu Aoyama (an excellent performance from Ryo Ishibashi) is urged by his son Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki) to start dating other women. After the tragedy of his wife's death, the film then becomes almost a light comedy, as the two of them (and the dog, Gangu!) attempt to match-make the clearly floundering Shigeharu. After seeing a parade of women as part of an 'audition' to be his next wife, the stunning, demure (and a very young looking 24 years of age) Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), dressed entirely in white, utterly beguiles him, and it seems as if the feeling is mutual.Shigeharu is a well-meaning, otherwise contented man with a genuinely warm-hearted family. Asami was a ballet dancer but damaged her hip, and yet otherwise seems very enigmatic; she lives alone in a flat with a phone and a curiously omnipresent sack  that moves. Shigeharu's investigations lead to a morass of deepening mystery regarding all who knew Asami – at the dance studio she claimed to frequent is a man with prosthetic feet, the owner of a bar where she used to work was murdered (his recovered body was recovered alongside extra fingers, tongue and an ear, which fuels Shigeharu's nightmares).The contrast between the increasingly bizarre snapshots of Asami's life and the pleasant mundanity that is Shigeharu's life give a deliberately disjointed sense to the film: truly, we do not know where (if anywhere) the narrative is going, and what is going to happen next. Which is probably just as well.Asami's sack contains a dog-like creature missing the body parts found by the police following the death of the bar owner; she sits alone and silent awaiting his every phone call. Perverse and abusive flashbacks that may be dreams show the girl tortured and abused. When one day he doesn't call, her anger takes on excruciating levels.In a finale that will stick in the mind of anyone who has seen 'Audition', Shigeharu is drugged and falls to the floor of his living room, unable to move. Gangu is killed, and the warmth of the Aoyama family home is corrupted as Asami emerges, dressed in long leather gloves and apron, carrying an array of needles and torture implements.Very slowly and methodically, she inserts needles into his eyes and begins to cut off one foot, before moving onto the other. The delicacy and deliberation with which she carries out these paralysing punishments are filmed in meticulous detail and the results are painful even to watch. He is paying the price for not devoting himself entirely to her, as others have done in the past ('All words are lies, pain doesn't lie').The film has been heralded for inciting the 'torture porn' style of projects like 'Saw (2004)' and 'Hostel (2005)', and yet remains more effective than any of them for not giving any clue or indication as the depths of the depravity unleashed toward the close. Truly shocking, hauntingly beautiful and not easily forgotten.",Audition
44,GiraffeDoor,It's everything you want it to be.,10,26 November 2019,"The reviews I read for this movie seemed to imply that it began like a cute romance and only then got darker.But this isn't the case. From the very first moments, this devastating tale gives every impression that we are going to a dark place and it does so, not by the same old droney soundtrack, not by those fake-out shock scares with cats, not by shooting characters from a distance to make us think something is going to suddenly jump out at them only for it to just be a friend of theirs or any other of the lame tropes.It does so by having a fresh and intriguing story and a note perfect realization of its script with atmosphere aplenty but not the kind that detracts from this most curious story of a man looking for love in creative way.Long before anything macabre happens one is slightly uncomfortable watching for ineffable reasons. We build slowly but unstoppably from this original how-I-met-your-mother anecdote to a fine mystery that really knows how to touch the raw nerves, pace itself and remind ourselves of why we fell in love with dark fiction.Takashi Miike has a reputation as a low-prestige film make but this is his Blue Velvet (except I like it a lot more): he was the perfect person for the job.Elegant, darkly beautiful and shocking even for those who thought they were numb to the cinema of macabre.",Audition

Japanese subtitles don't deter from the fact that it can easily rank as a landmark in cinema horror, pushing back taboos. Like Sixth Sense, you could watch half the movie and not know it was going to be a shocker. When the shocks come they make you want to jump out of your seat right into the aisle and then crawl back under it with your face over your hands. More Hitchcock than Cronenberg, there is little in the way of special effects, but lots in the way of a very precisely crafted plot, great acting and editing, atmosphere and moments of evocative beauty as well as terror. The story concerns a Japanese businessman whose friend thinks of a novel way for him to look for a second wife. That's all I'll tell you!",Audition

But the ending sequences are completely revolting, something out of the Marquis de Sade's oeuvre. (And, to my sorrow, I have actually read some Sade) Yes, I get it that there are psychological implications to be teased out of Asami's character. Even so, that is no reason to have this sort of sadism portrayed on film. I know there are many other films like this out there, and really not that prudish about it. But I think that this one goes over the top. Watching it made feel like Asami was standing over ME, saying ""Kiri, kiri, kiri""",Audition
47,kirbylee70-599-526179,MIIKE CLASSIC,9,27 February 2019,"I've become a fan of director Takashi Miike. His recent samurai films are amazing to behind. ICHI THE KILLER is gore fueled yet compelling to watch. Now his film AUDITION is getting the Arrow Video treatment and it too is a sight to behold.The movie opens with the death of Shigeharu Aoyama's (Ryo Ishibashi) wife in a hospital. Leaving behind her husband and her young son they grow together and live happily enough. Now in his teen years his son Shigehiko suggests he move on and find someone new in his life he begins to consider it. At his job where he works he discusses this with his friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura), a film producer. Yasuhisa suggests that they hold auditions for a film they might produce in order to interview different women. In doing so he might find someone compatible to him and begin dating her.The plan doesn't seem to be going well until Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) walks in. Something about her immediately attracts Shigeharu to her. Her resume and her experiences fascinate him. He doesn't call her at first but finally does so. We see her sitting by the phone waiting for his call, little more in her apartment than the phone and something moving around in a large sack. After talking they arrange to meet and eventually begin dating.On a weekend getaway Shigeharu is planning on proposing. As they undress he notices the burn scars on her body. When they finally lay down together, Asami demands that he pledge undying love to her and her alone and he agrees. The next morning he wakes to find her gone.This leads to Shigeharu's search for Asami. As he attempts to track her down following the items on her resume he begins to learn that she might not be the woman she claimed she was. Job locations don't exist and at the dance studio where she claims to have studied he finds a man in a wheelchair with prosthetic feet. The bar she claimed to have worked in has been closed for a year after the murder and dismemberment of the owner.Shigeharu returns home despondent but unaware that Asami has broken into his house and drugged his liquor. Paralyzed she talks to him, enraged because she found the picture of his deceased wife and thinks he is married. It is then that the weirdness begins, something most viewers won't be prepared for and the weak stomached will want to miss. But it is also captivating movie making.Miike has never been one to shy away from violence and this film is no exception. The movie was notorious when released and stunned audiences. And yet while it contains some of the most violent moments on film even now let alone when it was released in 1999, it still offers a world of innocence and beauty as well. In addition to that they story of two lonely people, both placed in their own worlds of isolation due to very different circumstances, is a touching tale. The end result is a movie worth watching, discussing and experiencing.Arrow Video continues to present movies like this in the most amazing fashion offering the film in a 2k restoration from original film elements. If that weren't enough they've included a number of extras that will entertain as well. These include an audio commentary track with Miike and screenwriter Daisuke Tengan, a brand new commentary track by Miike biographer Tom Mes discussing the film and it's source novel, an introduction by Miike, ""Ties That Bind"" a new interview with Miike, interviews with stars Ryo Ishibashi, Eihi Shiina, Renji Ishibashi and Ren Osugi, ""Damaged Romance"" an appreciation by Japanese historian Tony Rayns, trailers, a reversible sleeve with original art and newly commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin and for the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet featuring writing on the film by Anton Bitel.I've praised Arrow Video in the past and will continue to do so in the future as long as they offer movies in such great condition this way. Fans of world cinema and movies in general will want to make a point to check this one out. Just make sure you can stomach violence before doing so.",Audition
48,kluseba,I'm glad I'm single,9,1 July 2016,"''Audition'' is the kind of movie that you will never forget once you have watched it. There are many elements that make this movie memorable. The contrast between the beginning of the film that almost feels like a light-hearted romantic fairy tale and the conclusion that turns into a mentally and physically violent horror movie is made in a unique, profound and detailed way. The acting by former model Eihi Shiina in her debut film as well as the performance by her male counterpart Ryo Ishibashi who had acted in a few critically underrated movies before is superb, diversified and credible. The use of sounds, locations, light effects and camera angles is very detailed, innovative and intellectual and adds to the story that shifts between two extremes. The director also leaves a lot of room for interpretation in a movie that seems like a mixture of a beautiful dream, a gruesome nightmare and a reality somewhere in between despair and hope. This is where Takashi Miike surpasses the novel by Ryu Murakami this movie is based upon. ''Audition'' is one of the rare cases where the movie adaption is probably better than the source material which is already stunning.Many critics have seen themes such as family, isolation, misogyny, relationship issues and social values in this movie but I personally don't think that there is a deeper message in this film. The fact that this film can still be analyzed in so many different ways shows us the greatness of an unpretentious director who lets its audience put the pieces together without trying to spread a precise message. Even the conclusion of the movie is debatable and it's up to the audience to decide whether they witnessed a twisted dream turning into a nightmare at some point or to an accurate story. The line between reality and dream is very thin and this adds to the mysterious atmosphere which can be seen as the fascinating guiding line to this masterpiece.Another element that is very convincing is that you can at certain points feel with or even identify with the characters. You empathize with the poor physically abused child. You feel the fragile character of a woman that has been disappointed so many times in her life. You can understand the concern of the side characters for many different reasons. You can identify with the loneliness of the clumsy yet sympathetic widower. This empathy is what makes one of the best final scenes in the history of cinema even more intense.The story seems to be simple but at the same time it isn't. We get to know a middle-aged widower and businessman who feels lonely despite the presence of his caring son and his adorable dog. When his teenage son starts to date a charming girl, he suggests his father to open up to a new relationship again. After some hesitation, the widower works out a plan with a clever friend and partner. They decide to arrange an audition for the female lead role of a movie project but in reality the two men are looking for a perfect wife that meets the widower's reasonable criteria. He falls for a charming, emotional and mysterious young woman that simply isn't like all the other women. He starts dating her to get to know her better and their feelings for each another seem to be mutual as the woman isn't disappointed when she gets to know that there won't be any movie with her. Despite the warnings of his friend and partner, the clumsy widower is overwhelmed by positive emotions and quickly invites the young woman for a romantic weekend at a beautiful seaside hotel where they intensify and solidify their relationship. After an emotional night, the young woman has disappeared and the confused widower tries to find her. He finds out more and more mysterious details about the young woman's past and tries to put the pieces of the puzzle together.Telling you anything more than this would be too revealing. Anybody who enjoys movies should watch this mysterious drama. It's one of these movies that is so great that it will leave an impressive impact on anyone who watches it.",Audition
49,EVOL666,Slow But Effective Psychological Horror From Takashi Miike...,8,27 February 2006,"I gotta say that I'm glad that I gave Japanese Uber-Director Takashi Miike's AUDITION another look. I initially saw this one several years ago, and to be blunt - I remember it boring the sh!t out of me - but I think I was in an ""altered state"" at the time, so that might explain it. I will still say that AUDITION is VERY slow moving and can be confusing at times, but I did find it more enjoyable this time around. Many consider it to be among the very best horror films ever made. I can't say that I'd go so far as to say all that - but if ""slow-burn"" suspenseful horror films are your thing - AUDITION would be a good bet for you. And for those of us that dig the ""blood and guts"" stuff, the finale is pretty strong - but don't expect a BRAINDEAD-style bloodbath either...Aoyama is a lonely widower and father whose son convinces him to start dating again. With the help of a movie producer friend, they stage a phony film audition so Aoyama will have a chance to ""preview"" some prospective female candidates. Aoyama takes a liking to Asami - a soft-spoken ex-ballet dancer, and he decides to turn his attention towards her. The couple go on a ""business"" date, and it seems that they share feelings that go beyond the realm of a ""working"" relationship. They begin to date, and eventually Aoyama tells Asami that the movie's been put on hold for financial reasons as a way to weasel out of telling her that the audition was a fake - but Asami isn't concerned as she is just happy that they've met and are together. The two take a weekend vacation where Aoyama intends to propose marriage. They ""consummate"" their relationship, but when Aoyama wakes up - Asami is gone. She's left no explanation for her disappearance, which greatly troubles Aoyama. He begins searching for her, and things about Asami's past begin to come out that are both mysterious and strangely unsettling. Unexpectedly, Asami pops back into Aoyama's life - but this time, he may wish that he had never met her...First off, the slow-build films like this and A TALE OF TWO SISTERS (and many other of the newer J-horror films that have come out since AUDITION...) are not normally my thing, as I feel that this ""style"" is being overdone lately (mostly due to the success of AUDITION) and the ""payoff"" usually isn't worth the wait - but AUDITION was the originator of this style of modern Japanese horror, and anyone who's seen Miike's other films knows that he comes through when it's time to bring the red-stuff. I still can't say that I LOVED this film - but I do consider it a very original and well-made film - not to mention the excellent performances and cinematography. AUDITION will definitely be of interest to horror fans - especially those who aren't very familiar with Asian horror - just be prepared for a long, slow build-up to the frantic finale...8/10",Audition

And when he meets her, he does fall for her. She's half his age, pretty, reserved, shy, formal, sweet. As a young girl she suffered at the hands of her abusive stepfather. But it seems she has no past. As he starts going out with her, his friend warns him that he can find no past info on her. All the references she gave are dead ends or just lies.He spends the night with her and the next morning she's gone. He goes chasing after her with little info he has. He finds some nasty things in the process. When he gets home, she drugs him and tortures him because he lied to her and manipulated her.For 1 1/2 hours we have to watch this guy and the story move along, ever so slowly to the part that everyone knows about. It's only in the last 30 minutes that we get to the action. And it's not even all that impressive. Granted, Audition was made in 1999, but Dead Alive came out in 1992 so it's not like Audition is ground breaking in any sense. Sure, feeding the vomit is a bit twisted, but that's about it. The characters aren't all that strong. The guy is somewhat likable but you don't care that much about him. Much more likable is the son and the dog.Then there's the issue whether everything that happens after they spend the night is a dream or not. From the movie itself there's a 50/50 chance that it's either a dream or reality. The movie isn't all that clear. And I didn't care enough about Audition to listen to the director's commentary to find out what is really going on. You kind of want it to be a dream, because that makes more sense than the alternative. If it isn't a dream, why does he wake up? Why does he have bizarre visions, if it's reality? On the other hand, the dream explanation is the greatest letdown in horror movies. In the end neither explanation is satisfying nor makes this movie any better. And I sure expected more gore. It is kind of neat to see a sweet little girl enjoy dismembering someone, but aside from that scene there isn't much memorable in Audition.

""Audition"" 0f 1999 is not only an extremely disturbing and violent movie, it's also one of the most brilliant and impressive movies I've seen lately. A dark trip into people's psyche, ""Audition"" is quite confusing at the first time, and you'll have to watch it at least twice to even try and understand the whole film. When I first saw it, after I had purchased it on DVD, I watched it again the next day. Audition is extremely well-made, the directing is brilliant. The great directing, the great cuts and cinematography make it it possible for the movie to jump from one scene to another without the viewer even noticing immediately.Successful Tokyo businessman Aoyama Shigeharu lives alone with his son since the death of his wife. After his son tells him that he starts aging faster, and suggests that he should marry again, Aoyama decides to keep an eye out for a nice, well educated woman. A friend of his, TV producer Yasuhisa Yoshikawa, offers to help him by inviting young women to a fake audition for the leading role in a film. Aoyama is immediately enraptured by the shy Asami Yamazaki, a beautiful and well-educated young woman. The two start dating and meeting for candlelight dinners, but Aoyama will soon have to find out about the dark side of his new love...As mentioned above, the directing and cinematography are brilliant. The acting is excellent throughout the whole movie. Especially Eihi Shiina's performance as Asami Yamazaki and Ryo Ishibashi's performance as Aoyama Shigeharu are very impressive. Jun Kunimura, who played Yakuza-boss Tanaka in Kill Bill Vol.1, is great as Aoyama's friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa. ""Audition"" is a brilliant film, but If you're very sensitive when it comes to violence it's probably not your cup of tea, since it is extremely violent and disturbing. A shocking, but also very complex and, in some parts, even beautiful film, ""Audition"" is a film that has impressed me like no other in quite some time!",Audition
54,Jonny_Numb,"don't pass up this ""Audition""",8,21 January 2006,"While it takes some of its psychological cues from the early thrillers of Roman Polanski, and stylistic excerpts from Kubrick to David Lynch, ""Audition"" stands on its own as a disturbing, post-modern horror film with passages of genuinely nightmarish surrealism. Director Takashi Miike weaves a tale of an aging widower who holds a fake film audition in hopes of meeting the perfect woman; his intentions are sincere, and he seemingly finds his match in Asami, a physically and psychologically damaged 24-year old who hides a dark past...or does she? While a bit too deliberately-paced at times, overall Miike builds an unusual atmosphere drowned in mounting suspense; his actors sell the premise, and transform ""Audition"" into something more than a De Palma-esquire exercise in style.",Audition
55,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Scary Look at Love and Obsession,8,8 March 2019,"This was a film that I checked out when I decided to go through Fangoria's 300th issue where they gave their top 300 horror films of all time. This was a film that I knew about before I had seen. I'll admit the first time I saw this, I didn't fully comprehend what I watched. This last viewing was my third time with it and it was in a theater on a 35 mm print. To get into this, a widower takes an offer to screen girls at a special audition, arranged for him by a friend to find a new wife. The one he fancies is not who she appears to be after all.To kick this off, we have Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi). We get an almost montage that his wife is dying and their son is on his way with something he made to try to cheer her up. Before the son can arrive, the wife passes away. The film then shifts 7 years into the future and we see that Aoyama never remarried. His son is Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki) and it's just been those two. Shigehiko wants his father to be happy and remarry.We then go to a quite misogynistic scene between Aoyama and his friend Yasuhira Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura). Yasuhira works in the film industry. Aoyama tells his plan to remarry, but he wants to observe someone before they do. It is then decided that Yasuhira will take a script that Aoyama submitted, rework the story and audition for it. The real purpose though is for Aoyama to screen candidates for his potential next wife.Aoyama takes home a ton of applications and has to narrow it down to 30. There is one that catches his eye and he seems to have decided on her before they even start the interviews. After that though, it is sealed. There isn't something quite right about her and Yasuhisa tries to tell him. Aoyama doesn't heed his warning and we learn the truth of Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina). It takes quite the turn when none of the information she provided adds up and Aoyama goes looking for her. She has a dark and disturbing past to make her the woman she is today.I have to say that this film really isn't that scary, but it definitely is disturbing. This film plays the fact that Aoyama is lonely. After his wife died, he focused on giving the best life for his son. He wants to find a woman who is similar to his former love, so they both make each other happy. The problem ends up being in the way that he goes about it. He deserves to be punished, but not to the extent that he does.On the flip side of this, Asami is also insane. This film is really all about being lonely and we see that they're both screwed up in different ways. Aoyama's have already outlined. Asami grew up with heartbreak that her ballet career came to an end early and there is abuse there as well. She is looking for love herself, but how she tries to get it is crazy.My biggest issue with this film is that you don't really know it is a horror film until those final 30 minutes. The rest of the film does feel almost like a bad romance, except after this last viewing, there is a sense of impending doom. I do think that feeling of tension that builds throughout was pretty good and I will admit, it did get my anxiety going.Going from this point, I do think the film is a bit long. There are some things I think that could be trimmed to tighten up the story. I do know that the director, Takashi Miike, is known for things that he puts into his films and disturbing imaginary. We get both of that and this film is also based off a novel by Ryû Murakami. I think that could explain the length as well. As I stated above though, the last 30 minutes is intense and I love the ending.I will say that the acting is really good in this film. Ishibashi I thought played his role great. He seems like a man who is successful in life, but is lonely. He does do everything right as a widower. The problem is that he falls for someone he doesn't know enough about, which definitely happens. Shiina I thought was also great. She is shy in a way that is cute, but I love the reveal of her character. It definitely makes sense when we see the things she went through to become the person she is. Sawaki was solid as the son. I also thought Kunimura was solid as the friend. He comes off as enough scumbag who works in the movie industry and it is perfect for the role. I also needed to give credit to Renji Ishibashi, his role is quite creepy as well. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what they needed.This brings me next to the effects of the film. I thought they were well done, even though there aren't a lot of them. They were a couple scenes that spooked me the first time and the climax is intense. I'm glad it was done this way in an era of bad CGI. The film was also shot beautifully, which I come to expect from all of the Miike films I've seen.I would recommend giving this film a viewing. I will warn you that this is from Japan. The version I watched was in Japanese with English subtitles. I do believe there is a dubbed soundtrack for those that need it in English. I think that the acting for this is really good, the story is as well and the ending is great. It has a very surreal feel that make you question what is going on. This film definitely plays on something that many people go through and that makes it that much scarier. I do think the pacing is a bit slow and could be trimmed to tighten up, but the more I see this film, the higher my rating comes to for it. This film is definitely worth giving a chance to if you haven't seen it. I find this to be a good film.",Audition
56,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Ôdishon (1999),10,23 March 2005,"My personal favourite Takashi Miike film, and also his most well made and consistent effort. I would like to begin by warning people that this film is not as gory as some would have you believe. The myth seems to have warped peoples minds into thinking they have watched 2 hours of grisly torture, when in actual fact the torture is deceptively shot, keeping a lot off screen and only lasts about 10 minutes in total. ""Audition"" is like the kid at school you are warned to stay away from, only to find out that they are actually a really nice person. ""Audition"" begins with a man holding an audition for an actress, and hopefully finding a new wife in the process. The father/son relationship is well explored, the son urges his father to get a new wife. Shigeharu is apprehensive, fixated on what his deceased wife would think. Even turning a photo of her away at one point. They have an open relationship with each other, seeming more like a couple of bachelor mates, rather than father and son. People may be confused about this film at first. ""Where is all the blood and gore?"" you might ask yourself. The film begins as a slow drama exploring loneliness. The audition scene is a fantastic moment that wouldn't be out of place in a romantic comedy, one of the girls even taking her top off. Think a more subtle version of the cheerleader tryouts in ""Bring it On"". The film manages to pull off this dramatic change in genre half way through, by evolving to the point. It doesn't suddenly go psychotic, waving knives and kicking puppies. It builds up slowly and the last fifteen minutes is cringe worthy stuff. Miike really restrains himself, and offers an artistic, thought provoking, well performed film. It also seems complete,nothing is missing. The repeated music throughout the film is also effective. Eihi Shiina as Asami is an antagonist to beware. Sweet, innocent, beautiful and as deadly as a lion made from that liquid stuff the T-1000 is made from, covered in barb wire, with a gun. Yeah that's how dangerous she is.",Audition
57,aimless-46,Let The Buyer/Viewer Beware,4,1 December 2005,"Obviously there are some people who really enjoyed this film, and some even thought it terrifying. While that seems almost incomprehensible to me, I still credit them with the ability to get pleasure out of something from which I felt completely disconnected. And much like ""Mulholland Drive"", the film has inspired a lot of message board communication based on the inability of its fans to agree on (or to even understand) what director Takashi Miike was trying to communicate. Or for that matter what is supposed to be reality and what is supposed to be dream/hallucination. To experienced viewers of Japanese cinema I acknowledge that my finding the story predictable and simplistic is most likely due my inexperience with these types of films (although I love ""Dansu Wo Shimasho Ka"" aka ""Shall We Dansu?""). But my point is that other inexperienced Japanese cinema viewers will probably have similar reactions.Accordingly, while I would not take the responsibility to recommend ""Audition"", I don't discount the possibility that some viewers may enjoy it. Technically and creatively it is a well made. Although the production design was an afterthought (antiseptic) and every scene is depressing and ugly; the lighting, editing and directing/acting are all excellent.It is not terrifying, it is not even scary although it has some gross scenes. It would be scarier if you were unaware of its genre and of the film's reputation, the less detail you know about plot, the better. This film can only offer suspense and shock when you don't yet know what to expect. Unfortunately, anyone reading these comments or the DVD case has partially blown it-so reading the next paragraphs if you intend to view the film is a bad idea.""Audition"" feels realistic, in part because of the deliberate slow pacing throughout the first 2/3's of the film. Unfortunately that makes it soap opera boring and I began identifying with the succession of passengers in ""Airplane"" who commit suicide rather than continue to listen to Robert Hays' life story. I was able to stay focused by counting the many spelling errors in the subtitles, which were especially amusing on the occasions when they changed the entire meaning of a sentence to something absurd.There is much more mild melodrama than horror or suspense, like reading a textbook on abnormal psychology while listening as a BBC historical drama plays on your television set. First you get thirty minutes that sets up Aoyama's family situation and loneliness. Then thirty minutes to introduce Asami and the start of their relationship. Then forty minutes unearthing Asami's family situation and loneliness. Finally Asami begins to take her revenge on Aoyama but is dispatched by his son with remarkable ease, so easy that you actually wish for a Jason-like reanimation.The ""Uncut Special Edition"" is not a new cut, it is the previous DVD release with new special features. Director Miike provides a commentary and an interview.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Audition
58,RainDogJr,Strange film from the strange Takashi Miike,10,23 September 2007,"Audition and Ichi The Killer are the most famous films of Miike, at least here in Mexico there are, and now this films are must see for all the fans of Japanese films and for all the fans of horror film.Audition is now like a cult classic because most of the regular film fans doesn't know about it and the reason is that is a strange film and of course that is not for everyone.The film is like divided in two very different parts, and the middle is when Aoyama awakes in the hotel room and starts looking for Asami. Then he starts having a bad feeling about who is really Asami and finally he has this crazy flashbacks. The final part of the film has this extremely torture from Asami to Aoyama whit all the Miike's style but the torture i think starts when the friend of Aoyama starts having a bad feel about the girl, and the mental torture is the one that affects more to Aoyama.This is a great film but not for everyone, i love it because it an horror film but also a thriller because you are in suspense most of the film.DVD: the region 4 DVD is not as great as the film because there's no bonus material but well i know that is kind of difficult to release a film like this one into the Mexican market at least the film was a commercial success or a winner in the big festivals like Cannes. Audition wasn't that so is very good that we can enjoy a Miike's film in DVD here in Mexico.",Audition
59,nycritic,Complex. Study of Horror.,10,17 February 2005,"It's no secret that most, if not all, of the best horror films being made today are being made not in Hollywood but overseas: namely Asia. Stories not about ghosts, but about the simplest of acts, are being told with horrific overtones, and this is one of the best.Real horror is not about the actual confrontation between the hero/heroine and the monster in the attic, but about the anticipation leading to that encounter where we see an impending sense of wrongness, of something terrible lurking just around the corner that may have an equally horrible gift in tow. Takashi Miike, the true star and ringleader of this disturbing foray into terror, brings us a (deceptively simple) set-up about a TV producer, Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), who is looking for a bride by the use of an ruse: an ""audition"" for a ""film."" (It all has the lighthearted tone of a romantic comedy of manners, depicting sexual attitudes in a totally different culture.) Once he settles for a shy girl dressed in complete, virginal white, Asami, (Eihi Shiina), the stage is set for their subsequent meetings as he is drawn closer to her allure despite the fact that her resume has some seemingly glaring holes -- people she's been associated with have gone missing. When Aoyama decides to call Asami, we're introduced to the most disturbing scene in the movie: her empty apartment, her figure seen sitting by the phone and a large canvas bag (seen near the background). Once the phone rings, the canvas bag suddenly jerks, Asami coldly smiles, a scene that totally switches the romantic tone of the film and makes a screaming left turn into what can only be considered a surrealistic nightmare or a bad acid trip that is devoid of ""true resolution"" -- by Miike's own words. And by doing so, ODISHON becomes Asami's story, her reenaction of a trauma inflicted on her by a sick older man, with Aoyama as her newest victim.This is definitely a powerful film with layers of subtext and a study on how to create a convincing horror story in which we are the monsters and agents of our own entrapments, and that even monsters who re-enact their crucial split with reality were themselves once battered children. Of course, I would not recommend this as a movie to watch if one is ""getting to know"" their date. There is something revolting of not knowing the reason that a flapping, disembodied tongue just happens to be in front of the front door of your date's apartment.",Audition
60,Matt_Layden,Miike's Most Mature Film To Date.,8,20 July 2009,"A widower decides to audition some girls to be his next wife, the one he fancies has some dark things in her head and the nightmare she brings to him is unbearable.Takishi Miike is a filmmaker who will have made 3 films by the time you read this. The guy never seems to stop. Is that a good sign? Well, my experiences with him have not really been for the better. His films always seem to rub me the wrong way, yet I still think that the guy is talented. His films are just as weird, if not weirder then what Lynch has offered. What makes them different is that Lynch seems to have a grasp of the story he is telling, no matter how bizarre it might be. Miike on the other hand seems to go with whatever is weird and relies on more visually grabbing the audience, than having a cohesive plot. Izo is a really bad film that I point when I say this. His entry into the 3 Extremes film was the weakest one and yet I still seek out his films. How can this be?Audition is no doubt his best film. I'm still waiting to see Visitor Q and Gozu. Audition starts off slow, but that helps the shocking, twisted and repulsive ending that grabs you, stays with you and makes you cringe. Just thinking about it still gives me shivers.Don't go into this film thinking that it will make you puke, wanting to be shocked or anything, because it's all at the end here. Some people may be bored, but the story was interesting enough for me to keep watching. Some parts still don't make sense to me, but if it did then the film would have failed. It takes a good hour or so before anything out of the ordinary begins to happen and it kind of feels like a bunch of different films by the end (drama, romance, horror).The ambiguity of the film serves it better. What you may think it deals with one viewing, it seems to deal with something else on another. Miike surprised me here, I enjoyed this film.

I guess it was shocking, funny, and creepy at times, I'll give them credit for that but it was pointless when you look back.The performances were good but I just don't see the point.

The son suggests that his father should get married again! The father also is ready and takes his advice!

Nothing real frightening apart from one scene where Aoyama calls Asami for the second time (You will know once you see it)! After 80 minutes I was ready to give up on this movie because there was not much happening! But then it got into creepy mode and the pace got quite fast! You will get to see some shocking and disturbing scenes! Not because it is so graphic! (Most of the scenes are left to our own imagination and that can be more frightening than what you see on the screen!) But because everything has been building up to this climax! If this movie would have been creepy and scary from the start than it would have lost the impact we get at the ending! I do admit that some scenes are confusing!

Yes, the ending will shock some people but I thought it was rather unimpressive with what little it delivered, and a little too late, too. I mean anyone who has a phobia of syringes or acupuncture needles will feel queasy, no matter what actually happens on screen. And the amputation scene took place mostly off screen. So where's the real shock? The only scene that made me ill was when the girl vomited in the bowl and handed it to the deformed man as food. Now THAT was gross. But, and like a few have mentioned here, the whole shock ending is nothing but a DREAM! A figment of the man's (silly) imagination.I admit that I enjoyed watching a movie that was made in Japan, with a Japanese cast and for a mainly Japanese audience, but had the first part of the movie been at least interesting, then I think it would have made up for the silliness of the second part but the whole beginning is remarkably flat and uninspired.

65,BrandtSponseller,"Surprisingly ""deliberate"" but ultimately visceral film",8,29 April 2005,"Based on a novel by Ryu Murakami, director Takashi Miike's Audition is surprisingly ""deliberate"" and straightforward for much of its length. It's not a bad film at all, but most of it is in the realm of realist drama, even becoming something of a romance at one point. There are a few brutal images and scenarios, but they arrive primarily towards the end of the film, and they tend to be more conceptually disturbing than graphically violent.Audition is the story of Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), who is living alone with his son, Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki), after his wife, Ryoko (Miyuki Matsuda), passes away. First egged on by Shigehiko, Shigeharu decides to remarry. He enlists the help of a movie producer friend, Yasuhisha Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura), who devises a scheme well known to pornographers--he sets up bogus auditions for a film.Yasuhisha acquires a large number of resumes and headshots for this purpose, out of which he asks Shigehiko to choose 30 women to audition. Before the audition day even arrives, Shigehiko has his eyes set on one particular woman, Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina). Asami strikes Yasuhisha as peculiar, but Shigehiko has fallen for her and a romance begins. However, Yasuhisha turns out to be right--there is something strange about her, as the audience can clearly see due to the fine performance from Shiina. Audition explores Asami's story and her relationship to Shigehiko.It's a good hour, at least, before anything very out of the ordinary happens in the film, and even when that time does arrive, the strange occurrences are extremely subtle at first. The pacing and tone of this first half of the film is more similar to Hideo Nakata's style as displayed in films like Ringu (1998) and Dark Water (Honogurai mizu no soko kara, 2002). This is only the third Miike film I've seen so far (I had difficulty tracking them down for purchase or rental before I joined Netflix), and the directorial style of Audition was surprising to me. That's because so far, every Miike film I've seen has a completely different style (the other two I've watched to date are Ichi the Killer (Koroshiya 1) and Happiness of the Katakuris (Katakuri-ke no kôfuku), both from 2001).But as a realist drama that ventures into romance and slight mystery/thriller territory during its first half, Audition is a fine piece of art--you just have to know what to expect. All of Miike's films that I've seen so far--as different as they are stylistically--share excellent direction. Miike is extremely adept at handling his cast, he knows how to get incredible cinematography, and he has interestingly varied ways of blocking scenes. Audition has a combination of a voyeur and a psychologically dissociative theme in its cinematography, appropriate to the plot. We view quite a few scenes from a distance--the camera is sometimes even placed in a room adjacent to the main action; there is a great hand-held tracking shot following Shigeharu and Yasuhisha through their office from behind partitions ala James Whale's Frankenstein (1931); an important ""repeated scene"" in a restaurant that gives us another psychological angle, with significantly altered dialogue, is shot at a distance; in the dénouement, another repeated dialogue scene with shifted meaning is shot from another room, and so on.Of course, the main attraction for most folks, at least in my part of the world, is the more mysterious and visceral material that enters in the second half, as the majority of Miike fans tend to be horror fans. For awhile, Miike, Murakami and scriptwriter Daisuke Tengan (whom Miike amusingly says must have ""been on drugs"" when he wrote Audition, because the script was so weird--he implies that he tried to ""normalize"" it a bit) play with audience expectations as Audition threatens to become a more standard relationship thriller, then a ghost story, then a rubber reality film (all of these things are implied in turn during one of the best extended sequences of the film), and finally, we realize that it's more about a psychotic villain. This final revelation leads to the infamous climactic scenes of the film, which will test some audience members' constitutions as we venture into more grisly territory accompanied by marvelous hallucinatory sequences. The performances in this section are worthy of a 10, even if, as Miike says in his commentary, Shiina, at least, seemed to almost stop performing and simply became the character--a frightening thought, particularly for Ishibashi.There are a number of subtexts that one can read into Audition, although Miike characteristically (for Asian genre cinema) stresses an intention of ambiguity. Many read the film as kind of a twisted feminist empowerment fantasy. After all, even if Shigeharu did not have the womanizing history and ill intentions for the audition that some characters believe him to have had, those beliefs are in line with at least a cynical misogynistic account of the typical motivations. Shigehiko's ""girlfriend"", who makes a brief appearance, is presented as a counterexample to be surmounted on this reading, as she is a traditional token of a more yielding female. Shigeharu's coworker who says she is going to get married is presented as a more implicitly ""abused"" counterexample.But the film works on many other levels, too, no less a very literal one. Although I only thought Audition was a ""B"" (the letter grade equivalent to my 8) this time around, I can easily see my score improving on future viewings when I have more appropriate expectations. If you are a fan of Hideo Nakata's films, or even Byeong-ki Ahn's Phone (2002), which is very similar in tone, you shouldn't miss Audition.",Audition

His colleague offered him to do an audition for a movie so that he could find a woman to marry after he said he wanted to marry again. Asami one of them was very beautiful and he was interested in her. His colleague made it very obvious saying there's something off about her and her contacts aren't real. They checked in a hotel room and when he woke up she was gone. He couldn't find her and went to her old ballet school and found her teacher there playing the piano and his arms were cut off and wearing some prosthetic feet. He warned him and the bar she said she was working at was closed because the owner was chopped up to pieces and she was found along with some extra chopped organs . At her home there was a big bag and a man inside of it without feet and a tongue and some fingers missing and she fed him with her puke. After he was drugged with his drink and collapsed the flashbacks mixed up what's real and what's fantasy. I couldn't get how he saw her house and so on. In the flashbacks she talked about how she was abused when she was a kid and the ballet teacher as well scarring her leg with heated iron sticks. She started to torture him as he's lying on the floor paralyzed because he dated her for sex and used her. She used giant needles all over his body and with the wire that she decapitated his teacher, she started to cut his feet too. While she's cutting the second foot, his son arrived home and she couldn't knock him down with the spray and on the upstairs he kicked him to downstairs and her neck was broken and was staring vacantly at the man who can't speak. It felt like it was shot during the late 70s. The extreme naïveté of Asami made it less interesting and boring after a point. I was expecting more of a twisted ending instead of a long torture session but still the gore scenes were impressive and the story was quite interesting.",Audition

68,jluis1984,Beautifully crafted display of horror!,9,22 September 2006,"Japanese director Takashi Miike got his international breakthrough in 1999 with this bizarre tale of romance and horror named ""Ôdishon"" (""Audition""), and soon the world discovered the strange universe that this very creative and prolific artist had in his mind. A universe where the most typical elements in everyday life can turn into diabolical nightmares of insane horror and where definitely nothing is what it seems. In ""Audition"" Miike has accomplished a work of art that transcends the horror genre, becoming a surreal trip through the darkest side of the mind, that side that few are willing to visit.The story in ""Audition"" begins with the tragic death of Shigeharu Aoyama's (Ryo Ishibashi) wife, Ryoko (Miyuki Matsuda), leaving him alone to care for his young son Shigehiko (Tetsu Sawaki). Years later, his son encourages his sad lonely father to find a new wife, and his best friend Yasuhisa (Jun Kunimura) decides to help Aoyama by setting up an audition for a movie, where at the same time where Yasuhisa looks for an actress, Aoyama will look for a wife. As the audition progresses, Aoyama chooses a young shy girl named Asami (Eihi Shiina), and soon romance seems to be back to his life. However, Asami seems to have a dark secret in her past.Based on a novel by the successful writer Ryu Murakami, ""Audition"" is a complex tale of obsessions and love, that mixes (and twists) familiar genres such as the family drama (a popular genre in Japan), the thriller and finally the horror film; slowly moving from one to the other in a perfectly devised way. This slow development will definitely be a turn off for those attracted by the film's (or Miike's) famous use of disturbing violence, but it's actually what makes the whole movie more powerful, as it builds up its plot in the sense that one completely becomes submerged in Aoyama's obsession with Asami in a similar way that Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" did decades before.Takashi Miike's ambiguous masterpiece plays with the established film genres breaking the normal conventions in a surreal way. With excellent eye for the visuals he comes up with a beautifully shot movie that shows that he is more than a horror film director. As the film progresses one can notice that it's not what we see what creates the suspense, but what we don't know. As Aoyama, we are never sure of what mystery does Asami hide, the only thing sure is that obsession with discovering the secret. This identification with the main character is one of the film's most powerful assets, and definitely the key factor for the ending's shocking climax.Ryo Ishibashi gives a terrific performance as Aoyama, portraying a common everyday Japanese man. It's easy to sympathize with him and feel identified with him because he gives such a believable portrait. Eihi Shiina has without a doubt a more complex character, Asami, the secretive shy girl who seems to be Aoyama's perfect match. Shiina's acting is up to the challenge and delivers an unforgettable performance that will probably become an icon. The supporting cast is quite effective as well, giving that realism that is the main characteristic of Japanese family dramas. In fact, ""Audition"" could easily be classified as a hallucinatory family drama due to this twisting of that popular genre.As written above, is this slow (but undoubtedly necessary) build up what may turn off most viewers expecting a gore-fest; but the fact is that ""Audition"" doesn't relay on violence to be haunting, it's the suspense and the expectation what makes the film scary. A minor complain would be that personally I feel that the ending comes up too suddenly (strange, as the film runs for 115 minutes in the uncut version), but the ambiguity it has is another good surprise. Not many directors can handle surreal tales such as this, but Miike excels at it apparently without problem.""Ôdishon"" is not a typical horror film, it's not even a typical representative of the new wave of Asian horror, it's a completely different beast that definitely delivers an unsettling but satisfying experience. It's safe to say that with time ""Audition"" will become a new classic, and only time will tell if there's another masterpiece in Mr. Miike's amazing magic hat. 9/10",Audition
69,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Hits that nerve down deep...,8,9 July 2008,"A lot of horror films that rely on gore and torture to provide shocks all too often fall way beyond the limit of needless excess. ""Hostel"" was a recent example of this, it was a film that took what was probably the simplest possible beginning and took it to the simplest possible ending. This, however, is a horror film much more akin to ""The Shining"" in that it takes time to develop, takes time to draw you in and make you care about what is going on. The fear manifested here is not a purely superficial one. It is one that hits a deep nerve and leaves you thinking about for quite some time.Perhaps the most disturbing thing is that even the most awful things that occur in this film are, not at all justified, but shown in a way that you can understand why they happen. Same goes for all the other events. There is a clear, yet quite subtle, progress to all that goes on. Starting from the grief of a dying wife to the lonely years after and finally an increasingly fast descent into obsession and nightmare.Composition has always been a key aspect of films for me and ""Audition"" gets down quite well. Things simply work and in re-watching you can see that that they do. The film doesn't spoon feed you answers, but in looking carefully you can see them. That will surely require multiple viewings, and this is not an easy film to see only once, but for fans of psychological horror this film can only come highly recommended. --- 8/10BsCDb classification: Ages 18+ --- brutality, violence/gore",Audition

Starting off slow, Audition eventually picks up, offering a few genuinely freaky moments before colliding into the convoluted cop-out's of it's indecisive climax. In between, it feels like the movie suffers from split personality disorder, attempting to be a suspenseful, morbid sort of love story and then, quite rapidly, turning into a surrealist expose which helped usher in the current craze of ""torture porn"" (and to that effect, achieves it's goals far more effectively then current torture flicks).",Audition

Odishon is no more than a long development of its premise: a poor man fells in love with the wrong woman. The suspense is cheap as the only goal of Takashi Miike is to make the poor man look very very congenial and then...Whereas Ringu created a tremendous hunger to know what's on that tape, here we know the essential about the story. The peak is that 'pulling thy legs' trick. It's the only reason why they made that movie and I really can't understand why people will appreciate this.

72,RJBurke1942,The psychology of horror is even more horrifying than you think,9,28 February 2008,"We all audition, don't we, whenever we meet somebody new? We look at their face, their body, their body language, their mode of dress, trying to figure out who this is, what makes this person tick, and so on. And the person we meet does the same for us, right? Most of the time, we're okay, but sometimes, what we see is not what we get: instead we get the truly horrific, something that you never want to meet...not in your whole life.Auteurs like David Lynch, David Cronenberg et al habitually provide Western audiences with ""our"" brand of horror  true horror, and not that mealy-mouthed terror stuff you see in things like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and other slasher films that merely pretend to be horrific. We're comfortable with the Lynchs and Cronenbergs of our world, sort of. But, if that's your limit, then don't see this one, because you won't like this one at all. Not one bit.This is the type of movie you only see when you think you've seen them all...because you'll never forget this one. Even now, as I think about it, my skin crawls and my scalp prickles.Why is Audition so horrific? Because it goes right to the core of what can be un-human - truly alien - about the human condition: the ability, the willingness, and the joy  yes, the sheer joy - of committing the unspeakable upon a fellow human being. In a sense, it's almost as horrific to think that the writers and director were able and willing to put the story to film. But I'll stop short of suggesting that they felt any joy in doing so.The actual narrative is simple: an older man, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishsibashi) wishing to remarry finally, seeks help in finding a new wife. Using his friends in the media, he interviews various would-be candidates under the guise of auditioning each for a part in a movie, and finally settles upon a beautiful young woman, Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) who, without mincing words, is a cold, unfeeling sociopath of your worst possible nightmare. Beside her, Hannibal Lecter looks positively benign; at least he had a sense of humor.Notice how the story has two people who are taking each other at face value, while they both lie to each other about their true motives. Is this the true state of the human condition? In many cases, that is so; and that makes this story all the more menacing. And believable. Moreover, as I follow that line of reasoning, it may well be that the story is an allegory  from the female perspective  about how men have treated women as prisoners and slaves through the ages, and with the character of Yamazaki cast as an Avenging Angel. Well, she looks like an angel, but...Aoyama begins to court and romance Yamazaki and, while doing so, discovers that other men she has known have disappeared. Puzzled, he begins to investigate and inevitably is drawn deeper into her enveloping web of deceit. If you see this film, be prepared for the gut-wrenching turning point when, as the viewer, you find out what she's been doing with the men who've disappeared. Worse, you now know also what Aoyama has waiting for him...Which leads into one of the most suspenseful final acts in movie history, I think; and one of the most gruesome, if not the most. None of the blood and gore from any of Kurosawa's epics comes even close  simply because you've seen that sort of thing in other movies and, in a real sense, we've all been desensitized. But, nothing can prepare you for the final meeting between Aoyama and Yamazaki. It's so awful to watch, I've advised my adult children not to see it until they're much older, I kid you not. Of course, they ignored my advice.We all know that we can do bad things. If you want to find out just how bad it can be, then see this film. But, I doubt that you'll ever want to see it again. Instead, see Psycho (1960) again, for the umpteenth time, okay, to brighten up your day! And you'll also know why no Western film company has dared to make a Western version of Audition. Quiet simply, it just wouldn't be Western now, would it? Definitely not for kids and only for those who think they can handle it.",Audition

74,the red duchess,Superb updating of 'Vertigo' (spoilers),8,17 May 2001,"A friend of mine saw this blind before Christmas, and thought it was the most gruesome thing he'd ever seen.  Which got me interested.  I didn't find it terribly repulsive, but do think it's a kind of masterpiece.  Both judgements are probably related.  Because I had read the dream-cues, and because, like all great modern films, I noticed 'Audition' was a revisiting of cinema's Pandora's Box, 'Vertigo', I was able to second-guess what was coming - it's more difficult to squirm at torture within a dream than torture being actually inflicted on a character you've come to like.  So the extended torture scene, with its gleeful acupuncture and foot fetishising, was more of a deliciously excruciating exercise in black comedy, especially when the victim's son turns up.  But then, I'm so tough.This is not to caricature Takashi's narrative complexity - when I say 'dream-cues', I don't mean that there is an easy division between dream and reality, that one comes out of the other.  The film's major achievement is to create a hall of mirrors so that one becomes the other, reflecting each other to vanishing point.  Aoyama's 'punishment' is not the physical torture to which he is so gruellingly subjected, but the more painful mental torture where he completely loses his bearings, his inability to differentiate between what is fantasy, desire , projection , wish-fulfilment, and his 'normal' world. When Aoyama wakes up from his torture, and Asami meekly affirms her willingness to marry him, he is rightly terrified, not because she will commit the tortures for real, but because he has failed to master her, to fix her to the image he wanted.  Firstly, he wanted someone who conformed to his ideas of maturity and thoughtfulness, but her truth was more evasive, her identity a mystery to be solved.  Like Scottie Ferguson, he becomes a detective to uncover Woman, and loses.  The extraordinary dream sequence which comprises the movie's second half is a dizzying vortex: a narrative explaining Asami's life, the reasons for her mystery; a mea culpa about Aoyama's own male guilt in seeking to use and dominate women; an outrageous projection of his own fantasies of necrophilia, sadism, masochism, fetishism, dismemberment, incest, paedophilia etc.  These currents feed into each other, and destabilise the world of the first half, where identity, in work and family terms, seemed secure.Of course, they never really were - the narrative begins with father and son reuniting at the deathbed of their wife/mother - a dismemberment engendering the others, literal and narrative, throughout.  Takashi's main device is to involve us intimately with his characters, than pull back, making the familiar, and the objects within it, eerie and strange.  Right from the start - take the crucial dinner sequence after the fishing, when the camera withdraws, and films Aoyama with his back to us.  As the film continues, its formalism increases, the framing in alienating boxes taking the principles out of the real, modern world, and plunging them into something terrifying, depthless; the colours, tweaked early on, flush disturbingly. 
Asami remains elusive: always dressed in  billowing white, she is so self-effacing as to be a ghost, leaving no traces - as she waits for Aoyama's phone call, she is immobile, the undead, brought  to life by the ringing.  She is literally brought to life inexplicably before the actual auditions, suggesting she is a mental emanation of Aoyama's, rather than an actual woman.  There are elements of other filmmakers - Davids Cronenberg and Lynch especially - but imagine 'Vertigo' if Scottie had never come out of his catatonia; if Madeleine really were possessed by a ghost.",Audition
75,sashank_kini-1,Audition is an Absract Work That Remains Baffling but Sacrifices the Charm of Movies by Keeping the Viewers So Confused,7,20 July 2012,"Plot: Observing his father Aoyama's barren existence after his wife's death, Ryoko advices him to find a girl for himself. Aoyama's search for an ideal girl leads to an audition process where he and his friend interview girls to find a suitable match for him under the pretense of casting the selected girl in a movie. Aoyama falls for a mysterious girl with a gloomy past and an opaque present. A film like Audition angers me because I don't get the satisfaction I usually do from movies. Therefore I find it hard to give my thoughts about the film. I do not believe the view that Audition represents the evolution of women in Japan. It rather has to do with Aoyama's mind playing tricks on him during his dream sequences. But the initial sequences with Ashimi in her apartment with a sack besides her baffle the audience all the more and one cannot distinguish between the real and the imaginary. I felt the film did have deeper messages which it deceptively concealed behind the hallucination sequences, but it hid them almost to an unfair extent. Three sittings and I yet have not found that thread that would give the film a clear meaning to me. When I spend six hours on one movie, I need to be able to find the right key to the film. This key will impact me unconsciously at a moment during the film after which I am able to sit back and watch the rest without thinking of it as an abstract form but plainly a great movie. This happened in the case of La Dolce Vita, where after giving the movie a whole nine hours, I realized why the film meant something to me. Audition does not do this – it remains an abstract piece of work that would rather appeal to surreal artists. In short, it does not possess one of the most important feature of a 'movie'- that is to remain accessible. That is possibly why modern artworks don't excite me – they contain some selfishness and 'Love it or hate it' attitude of the artist. Balsadragon, a generous contributor whose lucid interpretation of Audition can be read in the viewer's comment section, has pointed out to certain things that may shed light on certain aspects of the film but I would like to point out that some points mentioned in his analysis are wrong. For example, when Aoyama is reviewing her resume, he is not consuming alcohol but is drinking a warm cup of tea or coffee and therefore, he is in his senses when he reads her profile. Also I don't consider Aoyama's thoughts regarding women to be medieval; what is really wrong in being a traditional woman who serves her family? The analysis seems to condemn harshly Aoyama's perception about women which I find unnecessary. The 'guilt' is more about auditioning Ashimi, and when Ashimi accepts the proposal, Aoyama's feeling of guilt reduces and that's why he doesn't want her to be a vicious femme fatale anymore in his dream. Nevertheless, it is a write-up worth reading because it presents many valid arguments. Again I stress, I don't desire movies to be so cerebral for the viewers.To those dumbfounded viewers who can't make head or tail of the film, think of it in such a way: a man falls love with a woman for the first time in seven years and is presented with vague facts about her, leading to a nightmare that transforms these ideas about the woman into something grotesque until he gets up in a state of shock. After he is comforted by reality, he falls asleep again to give a final resolution to his dream. Wish Audition had presented the idea in simpler terms. My Rating: Difficult to grade the film in numbers. I think the scenes that were beautifully filmed have to be appreciated. Therefore, I go with 6.7 out of 10. Not meant for general audience.",Audition
76,moviesleuth2,Good for a few thrills,6,26 May 2009,"Fatal Attraction. Single White Female. If you've seen those movies, you know what to expect from ""Audition."" All these movies follow a similar plot trajectory, and with this kind of film, there's no real wiggle room. While the stories may be formulaic, it's the director's job, not to mention the actor's, to generate tension from the story.Personally, I love this kind of a thriller. Done well, they can be a truly frightening, and a great way to get the adrenaline going. Therefore, when I heard the plot (and the buzz) about the Japanese thriller ""Audition,"" it immediately became a must-see in my book.The story is simple. Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) has been a widower for nine years. His wife's (Miyuki Matsuda) death took a real toll on him, and at the advice of his son (Tetsu Sawaki), he decides to remarry. With the help of his movie producer friend (Jun Kunimura), he holds an audition for possible candidates. One of them, Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), really sticks out, and he becomes instantly smitten. By the end of the movie, he'll wish he'd never met her.So, was ""Audition"" up to par (meaning did I enjoy it)? Yes and no. It was the kind of movie that I was looking for, and it did contain a few thrills, but at the end I wasn't satisfied. Director Takashi Miike tweaks the formula a bit and changes the balance a little. While there's certainly no harm in breaking away from strict formula, it has to work. Sadly, though, Miike's changes are not successful.First off, the climax is too short. While I'm not saying that I wanted to see more violence, the face-off between the protagonist and the villain is the one with the most tension, and that's what the viewer is watching the movie for. Second, Miike gives us no escalating tension between the two principal characters. Admittedly, this is not Miike's fault, that's what happened in the novel upon which the film is based (or so I assume, not having read it). But Miike stretches this out for far too long, and he can't generate much tension from these scenes. Third, ""Audition"" has no real atmosphere. That's not a key component of this kind of a thriller, but Miike tries to incorporate an ominous atmosphere in the later scenes. It doesn't work. Finally, Miike's handling of the flashbacks is awful. Sometimes it's hard to tell what is real and what is either dreamed up or in the past. But the worst offense is when he interrupts the climax with a flashback that SERVES NO PURPOSE! At least the acting is good. Ryo Ishibashi makes for a very likable protagonist, despite his view on women and marriage. He's stiff and and emotionless at the beginning, but after he meets Asami, he opens up and starts to display happiness (note: this is not a criticism of Ishibashi's performance, rather it's a description of the character). It's hard to believe that this is Eihi Shiina's film debut. It takes a skilled actress to pull off a role like this, but Shiina has it. She's meek and insecure (why Aoyama would be attracted to her personality is beyond me...again this is the story's fault, not the actress's) in the beginning, and she's VERY creepy at the end.Is ""Audition"" worth watching? I guess. If you're looking for a cheap thrill, it does the job (albeit barely). But if this is the kind of thriller you like, there are better options out there.",Audition

This one does have some disturbing images especially a few distasteful torture sequences guaranteed to make you squirm and the film does kick you in the stomach, but the acting and story is just superb.

This has well convinced me, this director has gift. As being witness to some of his films with original and masterful story lines, Audition is by far, one of is his best. There are some scene of sick violence, hard on the eyes, they will undoubtedly cause some of you to pull away from the screen. The interesting story works to it's interesting title. A lonely old Asian widower who's academic son, still lives with him, sets up a casting session, where we indulge in viewing many beauties, of much younger his senior, who he's selected from portfolios. I guess the catch is, the Asian beauty he's chosen, a real hot one too, is not at all who she seems. This is when Mike goes off the radar into the really weird and dark territory of the story. This evil and possessed girl is soon creating havoc and unnerve to her new love, threatening the lives of close ones around him. When disappearing, the old lover does some investigating, where we go into more weirder territory, concerning the girl's abusive upbringing in some out there and freaky scenes, one featuring a sniggering, corrupt figure, who provides another unnerving moment which his ill fitting laugh.

80,LoneWolfAndCub,One of the best recent horror movies,8,17 September 2006,"Takashi Miike's Audition (English translation) is easily one of the best horror films since Wes Craven's Scream. This is not just a horror movie though, it is part drama, part romance. It is a study of human emotions. Nothing ""horrofic"" happens until the last 40 minutes (and let me say, it IS horrific). The first 90 minutes are slow, but extremely interesting.The movie starts with Shigeharu Aoyama standing by his wife as she dies, his son, Shigehiko also witnesses. It's seven years later and Shigehiko recommends that Aoyama should get re-married. His friend suggests that he hold an audition. He agrees and meets Asami, a beautiful and seemingly normal woman, but she soon takes him into her world of sadistic torture and violence which he may never leave.....Audition has a lot of positive points going for it. All of the main actors give brilliant performances and Eihi Shiina, who plays Asami, is eerily good. The direction suits the movie. It's slow and it doesn't always show you everything, which makes it that much more effective. The score is brooding and haunting and although the pacing may seem slow, it never gets boring.But this movie won't appeal to all. While some hail it as a masterpiece, others say it is sadistic and boring. My advice would be not to tackle this as pure horror, more of a slow drama/romance with a huge blast of horror in the last 30 minutes.

81,Java_Joe,A study in madness.,8,8 May 2019,"Audition is like two movies in one. It's psychological thriller which takes a hard left turn into horror in rather unexpected ways. The last fifteen minutes alone are absolutely terrifying.Takashi Miike is a very prolific filmmaker. He's made over 100 movies, videos and television programs. They range from family friendly fare to horror but he's best known over here for ""Ichi the Killer"" and ""Audition"". His movies tend to have rather horrific elements in them and usually include things like gore and sexual violence or perversion. There's lots of blood and it's said that he was an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" with it's fountains of blood.The movie itself starts out rather nicely. We're introduced to a widower that finally, after many years, has decided to start dating again and wants to find himself a wife. So he, along with a friend who happens to be a film director, set up a fake audition for a movie they'll never make. The idea is to find a nice, quiet and old fashioned kind of girl for him. And he finds such a woman in the lovely Asami. She's a ballet dancer who, on all appearances, is exactly what he's looking for. He asks her out on a date, they get together and everything is happy to the point where he wants to marry her. Unfortunately the sweet and demure Asami is hiding a dark and terrifying secret. She's absolutely crazy. To talk more about her, or what happens next, would be ruining the movie.All I can say is the movie has a glorious climax that, I will admit, was a little difficult to sit through. I've watched more horror and gore movies than I care to mention but very few of them disturbed me as much as this one did. It's truly a testament to his work that Miike-san was able to not only craft this but have the ending take such a hard turn and still keep you glued to your seat.Highly recommended to those with a love for Asian cinema and those that might want to see a little bit of truly original horror.",Audition

It was a great funny, surreal, psychological horror film, that leaves you more uncertain and uneasy than anything else. Director Takashi Miike, has made a disturbing, unique, and earnest film, in a genre, strapped for daring, honesty, and intelligence in it's portraits(at least in recent since the Ju-on Grudge ghost era began.) The femisist reading of the film as bieng the result of Japanese patriachy, is apparent, the ""Audition"" of which the film takes it's name is a reference to the protagonists attempt to find the ""perfect"" women, much the way one auditions actresses for a film. The role reveral(crucial in S&M as it is in horror films), comes late enough in the film so that the acumulated terror holds more force than the average ""fright fest"", and manages in more ways than one to insert itself under the viewers skin.

Many times I don't really know much about the film, except for IMDb's short synopsis of the plot. In this case, I wanted to watch Audition because two of my uncles watched it, and walked out towards the end when it got ""too brutal to bear"". Now wouldn't anyone be curious?I must say I'm not at all a fan of what folks today call ""torture-porn"", except for the classics (Saw and Hostel, which were clever and well made and involved pretty awesome plot twists) and some exceptions (french film Martyrs is very highly recommended). However, in an attempt to remain objective, I try not to lash out at a film for being of that sub- genre.True, Audition has its sick and brutal moments, but even these have been well done and well thought of in my opinion. There is such a thing as ""artistic torture"", if you will. The story and build up are also pretty original, as Asian horror films tend to be. Acting and cinematography are also pretty good.Like other reviews have stated, Audition's main feature is the blurred thin line between dream/hallucination and reality. It has the best and most disturbing/alarming ""rude awakening"" scene I've ever seen, a scene immense enough to make the film worth watching.All in all, upon watching this film I've realized why my uncles walked out. You have to be a pretty experienced ""torture-porn"" viewer, or a very brave person, in order to endure such horrific shots.

This film is often spoke of as if it's a straightforward revenge scenario ... this man pays the price for his sexist ways ... but it's really quite a bit subtler than that. In a way, it's really about a man who has disconnected from the world after his wife's death being forcibly reconnected to another person, partly due to his own callous misdeeds, but also due to her legitimate desire to connect with him on her own terms. So ... it's really kind of a love story.",Audition
86,PyrolyticCarbon,"Good, real acting, slow paced and still surprisingly shocking!",6,28 October 2001,"Having just discovered Japanese movies, and how good the Horror films are that they produce, I sat down and tucked into Audition, after seeing Ring and Ring 2, I thought their grasp of mixing horror with a good suspenseful story ranked very highly. Audition proves just that, again.The first three quarters of the film is a simple story of a man looking for a possible wife years after his first wife died. He's a lonely man who confides in his work to earn money purely to care for his son. He story moves slowly, perhaps too slowly at times, but with such natural acting, you believe in it entirely. Then, just as you think this may be nothing more than a simple story of a man and a woman growing love for each other, small doubts are placed in the characters minds.The doubts soon begin to grow, and as more and more strange things occur, the viewer is placed in a position where they are in as much doubt as the main character.Then comes the last quarter of the film, and oh my lord, will you be amazed. I have never seen so many different types of emotion as I have when watching people viewing this film for the first time. Suffice to say, it's something I have never seen in any film before. I was aghast.This is an amazing film, if just for the ending, and as the Director says on the DVD, it's just a story to show how someone's everyday life can take a dramatic turn with just one small decision.",Audition
87,sunznc,Don't believe the hype over this,4,22 October 2009,"I had heard that this was a disturbing torture flick that was very hard to watch. I was in the mood for something just like that so I decided to watch this. It is slow, dreary, dull, boring, depressing, obscure and not much else. Oh, we see some halucinations that are mysterious and odd. We see this young girl drug a man and inflict torture but there is nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end. Also, the film sort of hints at supernatural elements or possibly a psychic ability of the girl but it's a cheap shot. It doesn't really explain or follow-up later. It is effective and disturbing to see this young girl so prepared with her torture kit. Like she's done this 100 times and knows exactly what to do. And watching her chant like a mother cooing to her baby is strange too. But I don't believe a bit of it. It's just too weird to get into. If you love Japanese horror go for it. Otherwise, the average viewer isn't going to love this thing.",Audition

I got a chance to watch this film on a friend's entertainment system, full surround sound, and the sound of rain falling outside.This movie really draws you in.  After you familiarize yourself with the characters, I sensed this eerieness, and as the story unfolds, you just find yourself falling right in.Miike's ability to draw you into this movie mixed with his cinematography had me entranced.  I couldn't help feeling for Aoyama's predicament and the whole audition process seemed twisted in a sense.  The best part is that the horror isn't someone popping out of the dark or blood curling shrieks to induce terror.  No, there's more of a psychological effect: it has you asking questions, then regretting finding out the answers later on.  Shiina is great as Asami (maybe too good!!).Overall, Odishon is a thought-provoking, thriller.  I'll have to watch this one again (um, try not to watch this one alone).",Audition

Aoyama surprised at his son's outburst becomes enamored to the idea and soon seeks the help of his workmate Yoshikawa, who sets up an audition for single women on the pretence that it is for a film role. Aoyama studies the CV's and falls for Asami an unlikely actress who had seen her budding ballet career ended when she was young through injury. Yoshikawa warns Aoyama not to contact this girl as he has a funny feeling about her, because he has found out her details on her CV are not all true and that her guarantor has been missing for a year now, Aoyama ignores his friends protestations and phones Asami and soon they are dating going for meals and drinks and getting very close. Aoyama tells his son that he is thinking of proposing and that he is taking Asami away for the weekend. Once there Asami urges Aoyama to love only her and never to love anyone elseAoyama agrees and they sleep together for the first timeAoyama is woken by the phone in his hotel room only to hear from the receptionist that Asami has left.Aoyama puzzled at her flight, phones her, but there is no answer, Aoyama continues to seek Asami through her details on her Cv but is unable to find her. What he does find is very disturbing.From here on in the film changes direction, from a bittersweet social drama of a lonely man seeking love, from a poignant and at times funny film it veers abruptly off course to such a degree that any unsuspecting viewer would seriously be shocked at how the film plays out. The viewer now becomes unsure what is reality and what is a dream, what is the present and what is flashback.what is for sure is that this film is a brilliantly and brutally realised film, the methodical way in which the brutality is carried out is unsettling in the extreme. My advice is go see this film, it might take a second viewing to fully take in what has gone on but it is ultimately rewarding, OH!... and to get your Mother to pick your girlfriendsshe knows best.DEEPER DEEPER!

This film is overrated, complex with a weird storyline that doesn't make sense. You see the actor imagining 3 things at once, next he is somewhere else, and then he goes back in time and back again. The Main girl character looks a little pretty but you can easily predict that she is mysterious. I was expecting a great twist in the end, but as i predicted, nothing but the same old physcho style garbage. People say this movie is disturbing, not really, I've seen worse. Just one scene of torture, which is not fun to see.Some critics are saying this is a masterpiece of Horror/Thriller. Yeah, rite! Perhaps you haven't seen enough movies.

91,coldwaterpdh,Waited ten years to see it...,4,6 July 2010,"As a huge horror fan, it seemed like a crime that I had never seen Takashi Miike's ""Audition."" I kept seeing it in Blockbuster and Best Buy. I own several of Miike's films including ""Ichi the Killer,"" ""Full Metal Yakuza"" and ""Imprint."" I've seen a bunch more of his stuff and I have liked most of it.I found ""Audition"" to be boring and jumbled, messy and incongruent, and ultimately a let-down.The basic premise is a guy loses his wife and holds an audition to find a new one. A friend and colleague assists him in the process and the our protagonist is immediately drawn to one of the applications. As to why, I have no idea...but he passes over several 'normal' seeming women and manages to dig up the freak. He falls for the broad, and she ends up being a psycho. We are given a very vague indication as to WHY this broad is so crazy, but basically she was abused by a former dance teacher and possibly some family members. In the end, she ends up graphically torturing and maiming our protagonist, punishing his body and pummeling his psyche; destroying him and mauling him.""Audition"" plays like so many other J-horror flicks for the most part. I was expecting it to be a little more clear. It was murky and I still don't really understand the whole reason for the woman being such a nut.I did think there was sufficient comedic value in this flick, as with most of Miike's work. The part where the son comes in and finds his dad missing a foot and looking like a pin cushion made me laugh. Maybe I'm sick!? It's easy to see why modern movie-goers are impressed with this kind of bland drivel when films like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"" garner huge box office numbers and millions of dollars. But for me, I'd just as soon pass it up for some of Miike's way more inventive films, or better yet, something like ""Oldboy"" or ""Ju-On"" which offers a true STORY and not just another dose of torture porn. Maybe I've seen too many Italian and Japanese horror flicks.4 out of 10, kids.",Audition

I have never been a man put off by gratuitous violence, and sex scenes were kind of obstructed by a quick thinking mother. But at the time of 16, I was discussing ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) & ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) with my father. Who would go on to recommend of all things, Takashi Miike's ""Audition"".A week later, as if by fate. It was airing on the ""Horror Channel"" at midnight till 3am (Advertisement, promo breaks etc.). It left such an impression I went out to buy it the following day, show friends months later and shout across the room about it to my art teacher. Leaving many students shocked and confused, as we discussed the movie at length.Takashi Miike begins by attacking the typical stereotype of relationships in Japan. From the beginning, two ageing men believe Japan's old traditions have been almost completely eradicated. In 5 minutes they summarise how they expect complete obedience from their female partners, already fuelling the beginning of many lies that couples will live in order to create their ideal relationship.I don't really want to explain the entire film, of course I would very much love to dissect it from beginning to end. But I would feel like I would be robbing you from one of the best psychological films of the modern age. However, what I will tell is this. It begins with the death of a man's wife, and jumps forward in time to their son (Now 17) requesting his father to find someone. Later a chat with a friend (Also film producer) leads to fake auditions being held, so he can find his ideal partner. Clearly he feels uncomfortable with the scenario, until he becomes enthralled with the young Asami (Model Eihi Shiina). Who has also undergone emotional situations he connects to.A two-hour feature. What begins as a slow build to these characters lives and blooming trust in each other, slowly becomes a living nightmare. In a finale so shocking, I found it hard to walk up the stairs after viewing it that night. The movie will leave an indelible impression first time viewing, that would be criminal if Miike had to alter it in anyway. Takashi is already well known for his gratuitous Yakuza flicks, yet ""Audition"" in my eyes will forever remain his masterpiece.Final Verdict: On top of being a well paced suspenseful flick. The immersion Miike builds just by incorporating a few Dutch tilts and some wooden acting in flashback scenarios, make ""Audition"" one of the most atmospheric movies ever made. 10/10. Even with an American remake now in production (Which will suck), I'll never look at piano wire the same way.",Audition

On the day of the audition, He notes her number from her file, calls her and takes her to dinner. He hesitates to call her again, worried that he will seem too eager.

96,valis1949,Raining Blood,9,24 April 2010,"AUDITION is, without a doubt, a Must See within the genre of Dark, Psychological Thrillers. Although transgressive by design, it emerges as a wonderfully thoughtful and poetic work. The first third of the film is casually paced, and plot-wise, it is very similar to Neil LaBute's 1997 film, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN. In both films, a scheme is created to entice a member of the opposite sex. These ploys are not absolutely nefarious, but just a bit beyond what might be considered one hundred percent ethical. However, by the end of AUDITION, we have been plunged into a veritable blood bath of grotesque images which detail graphic torture and the examination of extreme socio-pathetic behavior. However, taken as a whole, I think that Takashi Miike's movie is more about 'Perception'. A man seeks a companion of the opposite sex, and the film is really about the development of what this man perceives as desirable. Inadvertently, he finds himself in a relationship with a criminally insane sociopath, in part, because he is only concerned with what he wants, and is blind to her possible motivations. A rather simplistic way to understand the film is that this man desires a submissive or compliant partner, and he finds a woman who has been forced to yield to unbelievable cruelty, and has been hopelessly damaged as a result. So, in a sense, he got what he wanted. Of course, there are many other ways in which to view this great film, but AUDITION is truly one of the best Japanese Thrillers of the 90's, and you will be thinking about this film long after the final credits have rolled.",Audition

Audition also throws in multiple sub-plots with sub-genres which gladly don't make the plot convoluted, but propel the story line.However, no matter how you see Audition, it's undoubtedly terrifyingly effective.

That's what makes a perfect 10 in our generation? If this was made by an American director, American released, but with the exact same content, it wouldn't have gotten half the acclaim it got. But because it was released in Japan, it's ""OMG AMAAZING!!"" The story itself is a pathetic cliché. It's been used on cartoons before, people. How much more unoriginal can you get? The only difference between this and an episode of SpongeBob is that this has some watered-down torture in the end. And this was infinitely more boring.Creepy? Slightly. I think the main thing I can compare this to is the American version of The Grudge. This movie has none of the supernaturalism of that movie, but they're shot in similar style. But Audition is much less creepy and inspired. How does 2 hours of NOTHING happening on screen equal creepy? This isn't any more horror than walking to your coffee shop at night and making weird noses to creep yourself out. But the latter is much less boring.Violent? All the violence is a cut-off scene. It doesn't show any of the ""gore"". I've literally seen more graphic violence in Star Wars, rated PG.As long as brainless people acclaim brainless movies like this just because they're Japanese, true horror isn't made.

He had to pick 30 girls to audition. After the audition he makes his decision to pursue a young woman, Asami Yamazaki.Director Taksshi Miike and writer Daisuke Tegan manage to blend genres so seamlessly in this film. Near the beginning there is a very funny montage that had me laughing out loud more than once. Then later on there is another montage that had me genuinely scared. This same kind of genre change happens many times, flawlessly throughout audition. Being able to incorporate so many disturbing scenes and still having funny moments and heartwarming father-son moments is something that really impressed me.I mentioned there were a couple of montages in this film, both of them are executed absolutely perfectly. The editing and sound mixing during the montages is so great. The cinematography is also fantastic, the use of POV shots during one of the more disturbing scenes near the end of the film was so original and worked so well. Many long, still shots are also used a lot, and they are used very well.Both Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina give brilliant performances and are very engaging to watch when on screen together.Audition really takes time to slowly, meticulously present information. This is something I really appreciate and it, to me, is fantastic filmmaking. This slow build-up of tension makes for a really unsettling, brutal trip of a third act and eventually an extremely satisfying pay off.You should all watch Audition.

After ambling along at too slow a pace - it turns violent. Not in a suspenseful way. It's like there were some leftover violent scenes from another movie and they were pasted in.Add a clichéd ending and you have this complete load of junk.Is this a reflection of the weird side of Japanese psyche?

101,Christopher_Reid,Agonisingly pointless...,2,8 August 2007,"I'm guessing that Odishon was made with the intention to scare and maybe disturb its audience. Well, it did neither for me unless you count how disturbed I was that such a film would even be made. It did however manage to achieve an astonishingly slow pace made worse by the fact that most of the details are irrelevant to the direction the movie takes. Even worse, one unnecessarily drawn out scene towards the end actually started to make me feel a little queasy (and I'm usually indifferent to violence), perhaps not solely because of what was happening on screen but also because it was the point where I realised what Odishon was all about.To the movie's credit, the acting was quite good and overall I thought it was filmed well. Some scenes even have just the slightest tinge of tension. My problem was rather with what it was about and why the filmmakers felt that it was worth making. Suspense is often essential to horror films (for example Halloween and Alien) but Odishon seems to confuse suspense with simply having nothing happen for about an hour and a half. In spite of this, we do become quite comfortable with the main character so when the end comes, we are forced to imagine ourselves in his position. This may effectively achieve what the director wanted but in my opinion, the last half hour of the film is not at all enjoyable or rewarding to watch and I have no idea how it was intended to be received. If it was meant to split the audience or to simply be different well then that's fine but I think that has nothing to do with good film-making. Trying to simply get a reaction from an audience is not a noble cause in my view. Nor does it require much talent.I felt a similar way about Hostel. Both films have potential and both of them take arguably the worst possible direction at each stage. They focus on the superficial elements of the story and not on the deeper, more interesting components. They aren't suspenseful, they are slow and over-long. Where The Shining was innovative and unnerving, they are dull and if anything, sickening. They have none of the energetic creativity or tongue-in-cheek humour of the Evil Dead series. None of the mystery or twists of the first two Saw movies (I haven't seen the third). None of the thrills of Psycho. On the plus side, Odishon generally avoids horror film clichés although it has the unfair advantage of a lack of action.So, in summary, Odishon is basically an hour and a half of a well acted but dull romance movie followed by half an hour of drawn out violence for the sake of violence. It is the worst kind of bad movie - not badly made but based on such a bad idea that it shouldn't have been made at all.",Audition
102,RockPortReview,Brutal and Disturbingly Awesome!,9,4 April 2012,"Japanese auteur Takashi Miike burst into the American consciousness with this 1999 horror film. Miike cranks out the films like no one else by directing a staggering 86 titles over the last 20 years. Films like ""Audition"", ""Ichi the Killer"", ""Full Metal Yakuza"", and most recently the samurai epic ""13 Assassins"" ""Audition"" stars Ryo Ishibasahi as a lonely single father who decides to start dating years after the passing of his wife. The way he goes about finding this new love of his life is either brilliant or cold and heartless. One of his friends works for a movie studio and sets up an audition to interview young actresses for a non existent movie. I have to say that I'm no expert on Japanese culture, but the depiction of men and women and their roles in society makes quite a glaring message by Miike. During the audition Ishibashi's character of Aoyama looks like he is shopping for a new car rather that a woman. The last girl interviewed is Asami, a meek an introverted former ballet dancer. She is beautiful, mysterious, and Aoyama quickly becomes obsessed with her. His friend gets some serious negative vibes off her and warns him to go slow and that something is just not right with her, but he ignores him.Aoyama calls her and they start a respectful relationship. We also get some more background on Asami as we se her in her apartment and there is indeed something not right with her. The film is well paced and intriguing throughout with a climax for the ages. The last half of this film is not for the weak of heart and/or stomach, but really does deliver the goods. Asami's past is revealed as well as what she does to Aoyama. Asami is her own women who has suffered through some serious tragedy and abuse in her past, but is still extremely disturbed.There are several DVD editions out there and I would have to recommend the unrated and uncut version to get the full effect that Miike intended.

103,PCC0921,"Slow moving, but has all the style of a Japanese horror film.",7,12 October 2020,"I try not to read the packaging on DVDs sometimes, because I do not want to spoil anything for myself, but there are also times when I want to do as much research on a movie, as I possibly can, before seeing it, as a way to enjoy the entire experience. With this film I went right into it not knowing what it was about beyond being a Japanese film. That made it much more enjoyable, but I am afraid to say, that wasn't enough.We begin the tedious climb through this film as a Japanese man, along with his friend, come up with the idea of holding an audition of women to see who will be his new wife. Almost like one of those ridiculously bad reality TV shows that they have out there nowadays. The audition scene itself is actually my favorite part of the movie. It has a lot of cute, comedic, interesting parts to it, of which, the audition scene only takes up about 10 minutes of the first half of the film. The rest of the first half of this film had me to the point that, if I didn't see any lasers, explosions or giant lizards soon, I might run the DVD over with my car.Eventually, our main character finds the right girl and soon we find out that this girl is not what she appears to be. This is where the film takes an interesting turn and I realize I am watching another one of those modern-day Japanese horror movies. That is why I enjoyed the fact that, I had no idea what the film was about, because of this interesting turn of events. The film finally starts to get good, but like most of these Japanese horror films of the 21st Century (see Ringu), it moves too slow, lacks a good soundtrack and the dead silence just makes it tedious to enjoy. Oh sure, it has all the bells and whistles that these movies usually possess, like symbolism (in this case the blood red jacket that our audition girl wears in a few scenes), trickery in the guise of ""not knowing what is real and what isn't"" and creepy stuff like that. I never thought the Japanese word for ""deeper"" could sound so creepy. Unfortunately, the ride is too long for the little bit of fun I got from this film.

In short this film was nothing short of completely awesome, it has a strong intelligent story and the ending is a gore filled kicker that slammed me because it was so unexpected.

The film builds up its seemingly straightforward story about love between two people and - when the right time comes - attacks the audiences with some of the most shocking images of sheer, graphic torture.Takashi Miike created an uncontested masterpiece, making Audition an indisputably unnerving psychological thriller that astounds with its enormous attention to details not only in its romance-filled sensations, but - unfortunately for the squeamish viewers - also in its gruesome scenes of physical and emotional torment. While the blood-infested sequences last for only a couple of minutes, the most distressing part comes from the close-ups of Asami Yamazaki's face, showing this immense pleasure she takes from hurting another human being.In the most ingenious and agitating way Audition shows how tremendously deceitful first appearances might actually be. While love is the returning theme of the picture, it's not as much about having feelings as it is about obsession, misunderstandings, and unrestrained mental abuse. Surprisingly, the most honest conversation that the two main characters have is in the final scene.While the film will always remain as controversial as it's been on the day of it's worldwide premiere, it still proves to be a truly stylish and compelling work that is as close to true art as no horror has probably ever been.",Audition

Right from the very beginning she doesn't look right. In Japanese culture there are many tales of vengeful Yurei (spirits or ghosts) who are typically dressed in a long white dress with long black hair (think of The Grudge or Ringu).Asami treads the line between full blown psychopath and metaphysical being. At almost exactly an hour into the film it completely flips and the full blown nightmare begins.It's actually better to go into this film not knowing what happens but the last 10 minutes are pretty gruesome.An amazing film, one of the best horrors ever made.",Audition
110,Golden_Hope,Brutality Delivered With a Delicate Hand,8,11 November 2021,"The ""hype"" or what ever you want to call it, that surrounds this film was completely lost on me. I knew literally nothing about it apart from it had a shocking part. So I mostly ignored this information and just watched the film.I thought the beginning was great. It moved, it built character and it set up themes from the get go.The middle for me does sag a tiny bit but only because the gears sort of switch to a full blown romance but then the suspense starts to creep back into the movie. It begins to recapture the attention of the audience.Then there is the end. This was the part I took a small issue with. The dream sequence? It felt like sort of a dump of information. As if they had a lot to explain and they just threw it all in that one part to try and catch the audience up a little bit. I think that part could be slightly refined. But the actual ending. Wow it is so uncomfortable and brutal. But not just the violence. The reasons behind the violence.My take away from this film is it wants to look at the gender dynamics and gender roles of Japan. From the start where the men are actually ""Auditioning"" people for them to date. Like think about how gross that is. It is power that they think they have because they are men. They get the pick of the crop. They will only choose the best.Then obviously the story of the lead woman is tragic and I feel once again leads to this power struggle between genders, the men in her life take and take and take from her. They cause her pain because they can. To them she is below them.That is just my take. Maybe it has nothing to do with that hahaha. I just think it's an interesting way to view this movie and also gives it more merit than being ""that movie that has the shocking scenes""",Audition

112,pontifikator,A very difficult movie to get a handle on,7,6 March 2011,"This is a difficult film on many levels.Describing the plot is difficult for several reasons. One is that I should not give too much away. Another is that the plot is difficult to get a handle on. By the end of the movie, we are not sure what is going on. Like ""Rashomon"" and ""La locataire"" (""The Tenant,"" by Roman Polanski), I don't believe what the camera is telling me.The gist of the plot is that Shigeharu Aoyama (played by Ryo Ishibashi) has been a widower for seven years, and his son has encouraged him to get a girlfriend. The fortyish Aoyama has no idea how to go about it, so he talks to his friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura). Yoshikawa is a film or television producer. They concoct a scheme to call in about thirty young women ostensibly to audition for a role. Among the thirty is Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), and Aoyama is quite taken with her. He asks her out, and the tale spins into a maelstrom. The movie was directed in 1999 by Takashi Miike based on the screenplay by Daisuke Tengan. The movie is set in Japan, and some of my confusion is undoubtedly based on my unfamiliarity with that culture. For example, Aoyama is the owner of a successful company, and one of the women who works there walks him to the elevator to announce her engagement. Aoyama is surprised she's telling him and congratulates her rather awkwardly. She responds awkwardly, and he leaves. In another scene, it's clear she has some interest in Aoyama, but I never figured it out. Her character and reason for being in the film were never resolved as far as I could tell. I have no idea whether Miike was telling his viewers something or not.Some of the time, I was reminded of Freud's concepts, but I have no clue whether Freud's ideas are cultural and limited to Europeans or whether they would apply to Japanese people as well. ""Audition"" starts out as a straightforward flick about a man who loved his wife; she died in his arms in the hospital, and he raised his son alone. Aoyama and Yoshikawa have a conversation about loneliness in general and the loneliness of the Japanese in particular. Aoyama is urged by his son and by Yoshikawa to get a girlfriend. Yoshikawa's scheme of auditions for a movie strike Aoyama as dishonest, and at one point he describes the plan as criminal. It's my understanding that Aoyama feels guilty for deserting his wife, even though she's been dead for seven years. And I believe Aoyama feels uncomfortable with Asami's age of 24; at one point he's referred to as an old fool.The problem is that as we are sucked with Aoyama down the whirlpool; we can't tell whether the director is lying to us about what's going on. Is Miike commenting on Japanese mores and culture of submissive women (Aoyama calls Asami obedient)? Or is the movie about Aoyama's guilt over ""leaving"" his wife for the much younger woman? In the end, because I think Miike misleads us, I'm unable to tell. I think Miike intentionally makes the last third or so of the movie ambiguous, so feel free to insert your own meaning into the end.",Audition
113,jmaruyama,Thankfully not as intense as led to believe,6,1 November 2003,"Spoiler Warning - While Miike Takashi's ""Audition"" has garnered much fame for its over-the-top ending, I was relieved to discover that despite reviews to the contrary, ""Audition"" is not as gory as Miike Takashi's other well known movies such as Koroshi No Ichii (AKA Ichii The Killer).  While the torturous ending involving foot dismemberment and acupuncture were a bit harrowing, I found the scenes quite tame, relatively speaking (the torturous scenes in movies such as ""Misery"" I thought were more brutal).  Many have complained that the first half is slow and uninvolved but I found it more interesting than the much hyped ending.  The whole mystery behind who Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) is was quite involving and had me hooked. Ishibashi Ryo is at his subdued best as the widowed and lonely Shigeharu Aoyama who naively thinks that finding a date is as easy as holding an audition. I'm still a bit confused with Yamazaki's motives and why she went through all this trouble to bait and torture poor Aoyama.  ""Audition"" recalls themes covered in other movies such as ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Last Tango In Paris"" but coupled with Miike Takashi's unique brand of twisted imagery and gothic tone. I'm not a huge fan of Miike Takashi but found ""Audition"" much more palatable than his other more outlandish works.",Audition
114,quinimdb,Audition,9,10 October 2016,"""Audition"" is an incredibly effective horror film, but most of it is not actually horror. The first hour or so of the film is literally a romantic film, which is fitting, because Shigeharu Aoyama is a hopeless romantic. He lost his wife in the opening scene of the film, but the rest of the film takes place 7 years later. Shigeharu has been alone for a long time now, and a conversation with his son in which he is told that he should remarry seems to strike a chord with him. He suddenly feels he should find a wife, and his friend in the movie business suggests that he come to an audition for a film in order to choose his potential wife. It seems that he still feels as if his wife is watching over him, and it seems his criteria for a new woman that would be suitable for him is just all of the superficial things that made up his wife. He also seems to still be attached to her, still feeling guilty for being with a new woman, but he disregards the feelings and continues his search. He finally finds someone who seems perfect. Asami Yamazaki is a thoughtful, pretty young woman who seems to have felt loss just as Shigeharu has. But something is just not right. Her behavior is strange, and as we see from shots within her house, she seems... obsessed. And it is definitely implied that she has kidnapped a human being and put him in a bag. Obviously, the audience is constantly on edge at this point. Finally, they go out on a weekend retreat and the first thing Asami does is have sex with Shigeharu. She asks that he will only love her, and then the next morning, she is gone. With no goodbye. From here, the film slowly descends into a nightmare.Shigeharu has a conversation with his friend who set up the audition. His friend, Yasuhisa, he should just give up with this one, and that he really is just a boring middle aged man. But Shigeharu cannot accept this. He yells at Yasuhisa and storms out of the room to find Asami in person, where she lives. However, all he finds is dark, repressed secrets and memories. Then, in an ingenious shot that suddenly reveals itself to be a POV shot, we realize Asami has entered into Shigeharu's home, and drugged his whiskey, all without saying a word. Then Shigeharu comes home, and all we can do now is watch with horror as the incredibly disturbing and surreal dreams and memories unfold. It is revealed that Shigeharu once slept with his assistant who had been acting strange around him for the whole film, and it was possibly an affair. We also learn about Asami's dark past of being abused and neglected repeatedly, and eventually embracing the pain. She now only accepts all of someone's love and no less, and it cannot be shared with anyone else, wince that is what she believes she is giving them. And if not... well... let's just say she forces you to have only her and to appreciate her.I won't go into detail with the torture scenes near the end, but let me just say, not only was I hiding behind my hands the entire time, but at one moment, I legitimately had to look away. I watch a lot of horror movies, and I've seen torture porn. None of it is nearly as genuinely disturbing as this. If I had one complaint with the film, it would be that it was maybe a bit too slow paced in the start, but of course the payoff is entirely worth it.The film taps not only into the deepest, darkest depths of Shigeharu's psyche, but ours. For most of the film, it seems romantic, because that is the way Shigeharu looks at the world, and it's the way we look at the world. He convinces himself he loves Asami, but he is truly just using her to not be alone, and the only reason he uses her is because she is very similar to his wife. In reality, he (most likely) cheated on his wife with his secretary, and now, while he has completely neglected to acknowledge what he did, his secretary still secretly expected something more out of him, and the hints are clearly there, yet he decides to ignore them in favor of the happier story. This is what happens with Asami, and this is why the film the structured the way it is. All of the red flags for Asami are there, and even though he sees these, he refuses to accept them, and refuses to accept that he is really just a boring, middle aged man in order to fulfill his romantic fantasies. But as he is told in his dream after the gruesome torture scene, Asami is ""the real heroine, not the one is the movie"". Shigeharu wants the ""movie heroine"", but ends up revealing ""the real one"". After finding out about one gruesome murder Asami committed, Shigeharu is finally confronted, in the form of a question, with what the truth he has been avoiding this whole time: ""Isn't the world a horrible place?""",Audition

116,hoernkeem,"Audition review(1999, Takashi Miike) Bizarre, graphic, brutal and haunting.... ""kiri, kiri, kiri""",8,15 March 2021,"Audition (1999, Takashi Miike)
This is a truly creepy and graphic Japanese horror film from 1999 directed by Takashi Miike and adapted from a novel by Ryu Murakami it features a middle aged widower, Aoyama, who's teenage son wants to see him happy and suggests perhaps it is time that he find a new wife. Aoyama has a film producer friend who helps him by staging a fake casting call for a show but in reality all the women ""auditioning"" are doing it for the role of wife for Aoyama unbeknownst to them. It is a really sketchy enterprise for a guy who's intentions seem genuinely honorable other than how he is going about it. This brings up an interesting philosophical question for can you divorce his method of search from what he ultimately hopes to attain. He decides on beautiful, demure Asami. She seems perfectly submissive and Aoyama becomes enthralled with her despite some red flags including prior to sex requiring a pledge from him to love her alone and no other. As an audience member we have already seen some bizarre behavior from Asami including sitting still by the phone for days waiting for Aoyama to call while a mysterious burlap bag rolls around in the background.
Once they have sex she vanishes and that is where things really start taking a bizarre, horrific twist. I don't want to get too much into spoilers, but let's just say that Asami is a bit of an unhinged psychopath beneath the pretty as punch demeanor. Eventually she reappears paying a house call on the unsuspecting Aoyama who has actually been endeavoring to find the missing woman. He tracks her past movements and only finds more mysteries where she has been. Her reappearance leads to one of the most disturbing and graphic torture sequences I've ever seen on film which is one of the reasons this is such a highly lauded horror movie, and may have ushered in the horror sub-genre we now reference as torture porn influencing such filmmakers as Eli Roth who made 'Hostel'.
This has strong themes of male vs. female gender roles and misogyny surrounding the false pretenses under which Aoyama attempts to find his next wife and how he expects Asami to be. To Asami he becomes yet another in a long line of men who have wronged and abused her and she has taken on the role of avenging angel and what a calculating, cutthroat angel she is. You will go to sleep and all you will here in your nightmares is, ""kiri, kiri, kiri"".

117,masterjk2,"Truly gruesome, truly good.",8,18 May 2005,"One of the beauties of art when it's well done is that people can see many different aspects of it. For some, apparently, most of this movie is a dream sequence. OK, I guess. Except that isn't the way it ends. He is still asleep? Rather a disappointing point of view and not supported by the movie. The son is calling the police and the father is in agony. If it's all a dream, then it's not much of a plot, frankly. I want to give the writer and director a lot more credit than that. Dream sequences are acceptable when properly employed. But in this movie there is plenty of room for some dreaming, some going into a fantasy state due to drugs or the actual horror of the moment. I don't believe that I have ever watched a movie that made me so uncomfortable. When the poor wretch is being acupunctured by his sadist mistress who knows all the pain points instead of all the relief points, it is pain of unimaginable terror. Maybe it's because I've been to great acupuncturists and have seen their charts. The charts do point to forbidden areas. Of course her needles are not those of an acupuncturist, rather a torturer. And the glee with which she severs his foot from his leg has to be one of the most painful moments for a viewer ever imagined, for surely we have developed empathy for the protagonist by this time. The directorial mastery comes in the presenting of the tale, with tension built so slowly that one almost doesn't feel it, until the man in the bag jumps (he's not tied up, by the way, but rather chopped to pieces until he is totally helpless.) The eruption of the sheets after the supposed coital bliss is startling and defining. The flow between what might be the present, the past and the future is deftly handled. It's like a puzzle and yet not so badly presented that we have trouble fitting together the pieces. As to the discussion whether or not this is a horror movie, I am a bit baffled. If this is not a horror movie, then give me a more graphic example of one. We watch people being burned (a child, at first) and later our helpless victim needled and severed,, not to mention the man with virtually no limbs and tongue. If the viewers do not see this work as a horror movie then all I can say is that they have become so inured to horror on television and daily life (or perhaps video games when the anime is horrifying but since it's only happening to a cartoon, one has a hard time reacting.) This is a brilliantly directed movie, done in a Japanese style of minimalism, until near the end when it bludgeons us with the most vivid torture I have ever seen in a movie. How anyone can ""see"" long needles being poked into a man's face behind his eyeballs, with the Sadist singing ""deeper and deeper,"" and not think this is horrifying is truly beyond me.

Their relationship endures, but seven years later his son asks him if he'll consider the possibility of remarrying. Shigeharu finds this still to be a daunting prospect. Luckily, his film producer friend is sympathetic to his plight. He arranges a fake audition for a fake movie. Maybe Shigeharu will find true love once again. Dozens of actresses send in portfolios, but there's one in particular that catches Shigeharu's eye: Asami Yamazaki, a young woman who used to be in ballet, but had to quit for some reason. She equates this experience with dying. Shigeharu is moved by her tale and takes a strikes up a conversation with her once she shows up at the audition. Later, they meet again and together they embark on a voyage of self-discovery through which Shigeharu discovers that for Asami, it's the insides that count. He'll soon discover that when the time comes, he won't have a leg to stand on.Audition is a film that cuts straight to the heart of the matter.

120,m_madhu,gruesome yet compelling,8,13 February 2005,"takashi miike pulls no punches in this movie that is clearly not for the squeamish. the movie is devious and gory, yet credible enough to keep the intelligent viewer wondering.The PLOT: aayoma, the lonely widower, meets asami a pretty single young woman through an audition set up for the purpose of helping aayoma find a suitable girl. as aayoma begins to fall for asami hard, there is more to her innocent pretty-girl looks than meets the eye. a dark sinister secret surrounds her and her demanding love results in a tragic and incredulous end.The ANALYSIS: Audition has its shock value, but is there more to the movie than that? definitely. the plot (based on the infant terrible of Japanese literature, ryu murakami's novel) which starts off in a linear narrative hurls the audience through an impossible vortex as it hurtles through a horrifying finale, where the narrative spans through time and reality back and forth, leaving the viewer guessing what is real and what is a dream.PLOT BREAKDOWN -(SPOILERS herein): Aayoma falls for asami, he goes on a date with her, they spend a weekend together at a resort where he proposes marriage, she accepts, he wakes up while in bed with her having a nightmare, she realises that even while in bed with her, his thoughts are not entirely hers. asami's brittle and disturbed mind takes this as a sign that he doesn't love only her. presumably sometime he has discussed with her how much he loves his son too. anyway, he wakes up the next morning to find her missing. he investigates, finds out about her, her lies, her past involving her uncle, her aunt (who she probably mutilated and murdered, it is upto the viewer to decode and understand this). her record company agent has incurred her wrath too and he gets 'suitably' punished by asami. asami sneaks into aayoma's house and drugs his drink, kills his dog. in the drugged state, even as aayoma's subconscious is beginning to unravel all this information mixing up his own personal inner demons with the realisation about asami that he is figuring out, asami enters to wreak havoc. she is not done with aayoma yet. she begins to inflict serious torture on aayoma, including amputating his feet. enter aayoma's son and he saves his father from suffering more. end of story.FINAL VERDICT: Audition is an audacious movie, it subverts the viewer, throwing sadistic images and thoughts at him. However what makes it work is the study of alienation, childhood abuse, loneliness and the subtle insights into the working of a sick mind, what makes it so compelling is that the sick mind hides in the body of a gorgeous woman (Eihi Shiina who plays asami is a former model). Audition is a sick metaphysical tour de force, that leaves the viewer gasping for breath, while the beginning is a bit too slow-paced it is essential in shocking the viewer by lulling him into a sense of complacency leaving him totally unprepared for the sick mayhem that follows.A definite must-watch, but only if you have the stomach and heart for some very scathing cutting-edge cinema",Audition

I guess one needs to be quite open-minded about Miike's works, since the vast majority of his flicks are very original in various ways and at times Miike can be quite difficult to understand. Ôdishon is one of those flicks that are hard to understand, I'd say if you ask me. I have yet to this day never seen anything like Ôdishon, and the other works I've viewed of Miike aren't coming near a level of disturbance as such raised by this flick.For the flick itself, it has a very moving plot - both literally as well as emotionally. A middle-aged man (Ishibashi) who has lost his wife several years before the story takes place, decides to go on a seek for the perfect girl in order to get remarried. A friend of his comes up with an idea which seems brilliant, and they throw an audition to get the chance to scope for the perfect girl. However, one girl (Shiina) do catch the attention of his and from there the swift Miike roller-coaster begins. Violence is mixed with romance and romance with disturbance.This flick was Miike's international breakthrough and it really made lights being brought to Miike and the astonishing works of his. I would say that it takes a real fan of either Miike's violent style or someone who manages to handle a rough level of disturbance to fully enjoy this flick. I don't mean that you ought to be a sadist who enjoys seeing people being tortured, but if you do find the bloody scenes of ""Scream"" terrorizing you in your sleep, I guess Ôdishon isn't really a flick for you.Cheers Miike, 8/10.

I also learnt that many people could not stand to watch some of the scenes, in particular the climatic torture scene at the end in which the main character is put through a torture lesson by the crazed Japanese girl.The story is of a lonely businessman who is looking for love when his son suggests to him he should remarry after his wife dies. So his best friend who works in the film industry, suggests to him to hold a fake audition for an actress, when he will really be looking for his new wife. He instantly falls for a shy, pretty girl called Asami. But however, as he slowly learns, there is more to her than meets the eye which results in disturbingly and shocking truths for this poor guy.The funny thing is, if you had no idea what this film was about and had not read anything about it beforehand, you would think this is a romantic comedy. It really has the right ingredients to go that way until you reach the middle of the movie. A disturbing and chilling scene in which our main character, Shigeharu, calls up Asami's home phone, you see her in her house with practically nothing in it and a large sack in the background. After a few rings, in which she simply is sitting down, a weird smirk appears on her face, then suddenly the sack just rolls over by itself. That scared the crap out of me and it starts making gurgling sounds. Then you start thinking something weird is definitely going on.My only problem with the movie is with the final torture scene, you end up having dream sequences which I wasn't sure whether to distinguish between fantasy and reality. But the torture scene was really painful to watch and the whole film, you just wonder at the disgustingness and craziness of Asami, which makes her a truly shocking villain but one who is so sweet, you can't help but think she simply just has a mental illness.I watched this at night time and I seriously couldn't sleep.

It lulls you into a comfortable feeling at first like a drama and then more like a Hitchcock mystery, then just sneaks up on you and doesn't let you go.Eihi Shiina as Asami, the woman of Shigeharu's (Ryo Ishibashi) audition, is amazing.  So calm, so quiet, yet so deeply frightening she gives her role a deliciously creepy feel.  I thought I've seen everything in films and yet I was squirming through the scene where she tries to share her ""pleasure"" of her life's pain with Shigeharu.  The whole scene was so carefully thought out you can almost truly feel what she is doing to that man!Wonderful direction by Takashi Miike, and some beautifully composed shots like when Asami and Shigeharu are in a restaurant, when Shiina is standing on a balcony looking out over the ocean, and even the bizarre scene of Asami hunched over near a phone and a bag with somebody in it.  That one scene alone is my personal favorite in the film, it was brilliant and unsettling. At one point when you see her spine as she's hunched over, you hold your breath thinking you might see something move under her skin!Some things are left unanswered or purposely made strange so that we let our own imaginations run wild:  Who was in the bag?  What was with Asami's face when the phone was ringing?  The strange movements and sounds under her skin when she lay at the bottom of the stairs?  And, the details of the murder that took place where extra body parts turned up....The great thing is that by leaving some things unclear (or ARE they?), we are more affected by this film and frankly I'm hungry to watch it again.This is an incredibly satisfying film for me, and one I'll be recommending to anyone I know that has an appetite for films that are thoughtful and challenging.  This will definitely go on my list of favorites.",Audition
127,AnthonyMeg,When audition goes wrong,10,4 January 2021,"This has to be one of the most horrifying films out there. it takes you on a uncomfortably disturbing ride. I couldn't fully comprehend the character of the girl Asami and who she really is and her reality, however it was a breathtaking plot. it made me attain a conviction that Japanese people or rather should i say their directors are the craziest when it comes to creepy movies' ideas, they can't fail to entertain the viewers that must come from a really dark place, the movie ended strangely but that didn't effect the ingeniousness of it.",Audition
128,Ky-D,Just damn creepy.,9,29 May 2005,"It's been a long time since a film burrowed so deep under my skin and just stayed there. This is easily Takashi Miike's best, and most unsettling, film to date, and he does it (mostly) without all the 'goo' he's normally associated with.An aging business man decides (after some prodding from his son) that he should start looking at re-marrying. Being a middle-aged business man makes it hard for him to simply go out and meet girls, so his friend (a film producer) comes up with the idea of holding an audition for a quasi-real movie that he can use to meet some women. None of the applicants interest the man, except for one. A lovely young girl that seems all to perfect to be real. The man begins to court her, despite is friend's advice to the contrary, and soon discovers that she is nothing of what she seems to be and may be holding onto some very dark secrets.Miike could not have structured the film better. Early scenes are full of levity and some quirky comical bits (many of the audition scenes are really funny), but as the film progresses the tone gradually moves farther from light to dark. The tone shift is so naturally implemented that it never feels sudden or out of place. By the time all surrealistic hell breaks loose the movie has you and won't let go.For a character driven piece like this, even Miike's direction couldn't have saved it if the writing and acting weren't up to par. Fortunately they both exceed genre standards. You feel sympathetic for the business man, he is a lonely man and would appear to be a fine mate for most any girl. Yet, you also find yourself shunning him for his deceptive tactics. The girl is much the same way in generating mixed emotions; she is unnerving and just 'not right', but she seems so sweet and innocent that you really want the two of them to end up happy.For want of not making this sound like some melodrama, read this; I have never heard two grown men scream so loudly watching a movie. I refuse to spoil anything about the scenes in question, but when they happen you'll know. Men will definitely find this freakier than women, but many of the scares work well without regard. Gore hounds might be disappointed though, as the film finds fear in a psychological way for the most part and avoids copious violence.Enough praise can't be heaped upon this film, one of the best genre pictures ever and one of the scariest as well.9/10",Audition
129,GreyHunter,As a psychological study,7,22 September 2020,"...this was an interesting, if not particularly deep, film. It suffered from significant build-up that didn't really *go* anywhere. For well over an hour, we were treated to a middle-aged widower looking for love (in a fairly skeevy way, deceiving young hopefuls and wasting their time, as Asami actually quite correctly pointed out toward the end) and a young woman with issues up to and including daddy issues (which, of course, our middle-aged man refused to notice or admit.) There wasn't really a lot of substance, just hints and suggestions, and the movie tended toward aimlessness. Then the action picks up a bit and the reveal comes and shows us...well, not much more of substance. The extremity of the behavior is hardly justified by the hints we got. This is not to say it couldn't be believable. It absolutely could, if the filmmakers had done away with some of the aimlessness of the bulk of the movie and spent more time dwelling on the history of the woman in question. It just felt like a bridge too far in its current form.Incidentally, I've been hearing about how disturbing and visceral this movie is for years. The later portions of the movie are disturbing, no question. Visceral? Not so much. There were two sequences -- guy who emerged from bag, amputation scene -- that were fairly unpleasant to look at, but there are dozens and dozens of movies more horrifying in their imagery than this one. This one barely registered on the nausea scale. I can only assume the supposed walk-outs at Rotterdam and the person who fainted was publicity ploys, because I don't have the strongest stomach (I won't watch torture porn like ""Hostel"") but I barely raised an eyebrow at the scenes.As I said, it was disturbing, but since the disturbing nature comes primarily from the character studies, it didn't reach anywhere near its potential because the character studies were fairly shallow and didn't do the hard work of developing the movie toward its conclusion well.",Audition

132,Boggman,Don't believe the hype......,5,23 August 2005,"Director Mike Takashi's ""Audition"" is by no means a bad movie; however, it is hardly the gruesome and shocking movie that I had prepared myself for. The torture scene that the viewer must wait over an hr for really wasn't ALL that scary, and I was left a bit disappointed. Maybe after watching ""Audtion"" featured on Bravos 100 scariest moments (ranked #11), or reading the massive reviews prior to watching the movie; I was expecting more. However, when all was said and done I didn't find ""Audition"" to be all that exciting. The movie itself is decent, if not somewhat slow paced. If your looking to be truly shocked, then I wouldn't count on ""Audition"". The film overall seems to have more ""hype"" than it does ""substance"".The movie is worth watching, but probably best viewed by an audience who doesn't know too much about the plot beforehand. In the case of ""Audition"", the less you know the better. Too much information diminishes what is supposed to be a climatic and demented finale......It's hard to categorize a movie like ""Audtion"". I wouldn't necessarily call it a horror /thriller movie. I would lean more towards a psychological drama... which I was not expecting going into it. I do have to say that when Asami says ""deeper, deeper, deeper"" she sounds like a kitten meowing with sadistic glee. I got a kick out of that.Personally, after watching Audition I would prefer a good old American slasher flick any day; which was exactly what I put on as soon as the movie was over.",Audition

When you first see this film, you might be bored by the first hour or so of it...until the phone rings! The genius behind this movie is that it lulls the viewer into a false sense of security and then launches a full-fledged assault on your senses. Even though it may appear to start out slow, the key to this movie is to pay very close attention to details. Everything that happens in this film is a build-up to the final few minutes. This is one of those films that hits very close to home...there are no ghosts, demons, monsters, or zombies in this film...everyone can relate to both the hero and the villain in this one...if you've ever had one of those dates where half-way through it you begin to realize that you're dealing with someone whose not quite right...you will be terrified by this movie!",Audition
134,turkam,The worst Japanese film I've ever seen!,7,7 July 2003,"Perhaps, at age 33, I am becoming too cinematically conservative; but to me this film is a bad experiment in shock and gore which only goes to extremes to cover up flaws in the film's thin plotline and lack of engaging characters. Ozu, Kurosawa and Mitzogushi must be rolling in their graves! I have seen other Japanese films which are a bit extreme in nation, such as ""Tokyo Decadence"" and Oshima's ""In the Realm of the Senses"" but those films at least partially succeeded where this film failed. The directing is lousy, the script makes no sense, and the gore is just repulsive--- it adds no shocks or thrills. Perhaps, there is a deeper cultural theme to this film which I am completely oblivious too. I'm not surprised it has a high rating on the IMDB. This type of film alas appeals to the 18-24 crowd which make up the bulk of IMDB voters. But, for me, the best Japanese films like ""Ugetsu,"" ""Rashomon"" and the modern film ""Ghost Actress"" are genuine works of cinematic art. This is one is far from it. In fact, I consider it the worst Japanese film I've ever seen!",Audition

I don't pretend to totally understand the film...what is real and what is not...that would probably take many more viewings. I also found some of the comments referencing other films like Vertigo to be quite valid. I did think that deception is at the root of the whole film, though. Think about it, not only does Asami lie about the true reason for the audition to Aoyama, he lies about the fact that he has already pre-selected her to his friend...making the ""phony"" audition doubly so for all the others who show up...they have no hope to be chosen either for the bogus film or for his wife. That he feels deep guilt about his deception is obvious in his dream/hallucination sequence when his secretary appears bemoaning the fact that he had sex with her one time and never called her again (a failed audition?)and most importantly in his remembrance of Aoyama's perverse stepfather begging her to ""Dance for me, Dance for me"" when he really wanted to gain sexual gratification from the act. The guilt he bears from these deceptions men foist upon women makes the torturous punishment he has to bear almost justified. I suppose women could feel that dating in itself is a bogus audition with men saying they have one goal while they clearly have another. Of course, we could all complain feeling life itself is an audition for entrance into heaven while it's probably just one for death. Hmmm, getting a bit out there...

137,badgrrlkane,Is probably the best Asian Film I've ever seen & IS brutal!! Not for the squeamish!,8,19 May 2005,"Brutal!! Is the best way to describe this ingenious Asian classic that starts off as a strange romance film & towards the end turns into a S/M horror show. I've worked on-off as a professional dominatrix for the past 13 yrs & have inflicted my share of extreme pain to consensual ""slaves"" but the idea of a ""straight Vanilla type of man"" being forced into a ""extreme"" S/M relationship with a deranged abused Japenese girl who seems sweet & innocent until you see the scene where the phone is ringing, she's staring at it as it rings & then this bundle in this very large bag starts rolling around & growling let's you know something very strange is going on & it just get's weirder & weirder as this film goes on. The end scenes where she's paralyzed the nice man & is torturing him beyond anything even remotely sexual, as she takes huge needles & pierces his chest & eyelids, made me squirm in my seat to the point where i was actually hollering out loud. Then, her little chant of Deeper,deeper,deeper, which almost sounded as if she was saying "" Here kitty kitty"" & then the brutal scenes of her using piano wire to cut off both of his feet while he lays there helplessly, was almost too much too take even for a self-professed gore-hound such as myself, as this strange romance film has definitely turned into a horror Film Classic at this point of the film. Then when she starts threatening the man's young son who is to be returning from a friend's house soon is suspense at his best. i don't remember the Asian actors names but they were all great. And, the scene where the bagged slave has to eat her puke, which looks a lot like watered-down pea soup, is grotesqueness at it's best. I loved this film! Even if you aren't into or don't like Asian films (which was me until i saw this Horror classic) or hate subtitled films do yourself a favor & definitely check this film out. It's way worth it. it starts off a little slow but the end result is Horror at it's finest when America is desperate for new Horror ideas.

141,tenten76,"If you like Japanese horror (Ring, The Eye), you'll like this.",7,8 November 2002,"Man meets girl, girl turns out to be a psycho..  It's a pretty standard plot, but with Japanese minimalism and teeth-clenching horror, rather than Hollywood's bunny-boiling/stalker methods.Although it is vaguely boring to start with (and the director fully admits this was his intention), we soon get a glimpse of the woman's apartment and 'the sack' - frightening enough to keep you glued until the very end.. Which is also where we see the scenes which will play havoc with more sensitive stomachs (the moments which a lot of you will have been waiting for).Audition IS worth seeing if you're a horror fan, but I think a remake/rewrite  by someone like David Fincher or Christopher Nolan would be able to retain the 'fear factor', and make the rest of the film much more interesting.And I've got to add a *SPOILER* here:Why was nothing done with the doubting colleague?  Ideally, he would have disappeared mysteriously after warning his friend, and only turned up again at the end (perhaps in a fridge).  A missed opportunity.Similarly, the film makes it clear that she's a serial killer/torturer and has done this to several men.

143,jnguyen46117,Audition: 7/10,7,19 March 2011,"Aoyama had been a window raising a child for quite sometime after the death of his wife. Feeling lonely because his son kept bringing home friends, Aoyama decided to host an audition for a television show to find himself a wife. Eyeing through the resume, one caught his eyes. The resume of a ballet dancer, Asami. After asking her to dinner, Aoyama was convinced that he knows everything about her and wanted to propose. But not after Aoyama found out the hard way that the woman he loves is not who she said she was. Having her past victim tied up in her apartment and eating her puke as a meal, Asami is a character that will not get out of your mind. Cutting off her victim's leg while smiling and collecting tongues as a trophy, Asami can be viewed in many ways. The whole movie can be viewed as a revenge flick, a sadistic film only performed by a female, or a romantic idealism. Either way, director Takisha Miike's bold shots of the gore is much appreciated, he added much more to the slow-pacing of the film. Audition is one of those films that you can either hate or love, but no one will go out not remembering this.",Audition

In a good way.,8,14 October 2020,"I've never thought of David Lynch as a horror director, but this film by Takashi Mike could sit beautifully as a companion piece to Mulholland Drive.I think that other reviewers are right at that everything after he gets into bed with her for the first time is a dream (except the bit where he wakes up briefly).What impresses most about this movie is the psychology. As with Mulholland Drive, the dream is driven by guilt, in this case, the protagonist's guilt over dating again after the death of his wife. Aspects of Ashami's past (the inconsistencies on her resume, etc), and her asking him to love only her, assume a menace when viewed through the protagonist's guilt.I was on the fence in this movie mostly because of the radical shift from romance to horror, but ultimately, I think it works.The torture scene was well done if a little implausible, but it's really not the point of the movie.",Audition

Some I could care less about (Dead or Alive), some were just plain disturbing (Visitor Q), and then there is ""Audition"". If you ask me, it's a film that puts David Lynch to shame. You know the premise, so I won't bore you with reiterations. Let's just say you coast at an easy pace for a good 45 minutes and then slowly descend into hell for 15 minutes until you get to the end, which is the 9th circle of hell. The end, without giving away too much, is one of the most gut-wrenching, vile and disgusting climaxes ever made. But at the same time, because you take the bait from the beginning, you are mesmerized by this film all the way to the end. Some may liken it to ""Fatal Attraction"", but that would give ""Audition"" a bad name. This film is well crafted and well acted. Ryo Ishibashi gives one of the most convincing acting jobs as a widowed father in search of love on screen (makes Tom Hanks in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" look like dinner theatre acting), and Eihi Shiina, a former model, does a great job in her role as a woman with a past.

146,gothic_a666,Shocking,8,3 July 2006,"Audition: a twisted tour de force that weaves a problematic relationship between a young woman and an older man, gathering momentum only to demolish itself in the form of a horrifying study on violence and the life shattering effects of abuse. The first aspect of this movie that stands out is its relentless slow pace, the discreet and sober manner in which events unroll before our eyes, craftily displaying an emotional journey that is mostly dream-like. Yet beneath it all there is a lingering note of disquiet and almost of danger running under the pristine surface: a lingering undertow of menace that is manifest not so much in the man's desire, somewhat shadowed by a not resolved sense of guilt, as by the angelic woman's vulnerability and mystery. She seems to belong to a world of her own, and whenever we are given a glimpse of her life alone- without the contamination of the male idealization that is responsible for her image as a social being- what we see is a disturbing revelation of painful solitude tinged with paranoia.In fact, we know precious little about the girl's life apart from the information she herself provides. And this mis-perception of one's identity, this almost complete cancellation of a person's true person and its subsequent displacement by another's anxiety, is the source of all subsequent tragedies. By replacing Asami's character with a projection of his own yearnings, Aoyama has already committed a crime by falling into a fallacy that can only result in emotional bankruptcy. But the specific conditions of the relationship transform a error of judgement into a grave ordeal that is endured through pain, strife and absolute horror.For Asami is not a normal woman elevated to the epitome of virtue only to betray a few faults , she is a dark and deeply disturbed person whose life is completely subjugated by cruel and demented desires that cannot be extricated from her being. Because all she has ever known was pain, Asami comes to accept pain as the only safe medium of communication. Words fail, affections cannot be trusted and the only safe hermeneutic pattern in which she can rely is that that is most familiar and closest to her heart: pain. By choosing to partake from her being in the most intimate way, and by suggesting a marriage, Aoyama has unknowingly, committed himself to be the object of a terrible torture: the only means available to Asami to express her love, fear, hurt and pent up desire to take revenge.Disclosure: Under the influence of a drug, Aoyama's mental cohesion gives way to a highly disturbing sequence of hallucinations that put him in touch with the real Asami. Not the object of his affections but the woman who pre-existed his intervention in her life and that exists locked within a personal nightmare to which he is introduced. ***Spoiler***That Asami understands revenge to be a intrinsic element of her psyche is shown by the fact that she keeps a man who she has mutilated to the point he hardly looks human, within a bag, fully within her power. More, she feeds this hapless being her own vomit and has reduced him to a status of complete indigence. ***End Spoiler***And slowly, Aoyama comes to understand, through the haze of horror that pervades this out of body experience, just who Asami is. His own memories of her are revisited and the confessional aspects are emphasized. He was given clues to the terrifying person lurking right under all the glamour but could not identify them for what they were. He chose to believe that the result of pain was a stoical self awakening of the soul and a deeper sense of empathy, ignoring that constant suffering begs to be unleashed for innocence will strike back. All this is delivered with a flawless cinematography that emphasizes the states of mind with the use of colour filters and odd angles that add a lot to the oneiric feel of the movie. By the time the torture scene begins, we have already been inside Asami's self and have witnessed how she came to become what she is: it is the explanation needed, a justification that supplants the reasons she provides herself. There is nothing vague about this particular scene. It is gruesome, highly realistic and a clear reminder that violence is a cycle. I suspect that this kind of sensibility is particular to Asian movies, it is both straight forward and subtle, the act is reinforced by the slow paced atmosphere, setting the tempo of the action as if it stretches time ad eternum. There is exultation in the act but it is a kind of satisfaction that isn't glorified as it so often happens in American productions. It isn't fake or mechanically contrived but highly personal and credible. Yet it avoids any moral judgement. Both succinct and intense, methodical and ecstatic, it creates a reaction of disgust and fascination that is oddly combined in a precarious balance. This is not an easy to follow movie, it entails a manifold of readings and self-contradictory interpretations that require multiple viewings and a great deal of reflection to grasp or even fathom all the possibilities implicit in its many suggestions. Often discarding a linear narrative structure to give way to more creative methods of psychological investigation, Audition, ultimately, is about empathy.Complete empathy: sharing emotions and states of mind. Asami's emotional palette is damaged and has been reduced by all her experiences as a child, to choose to share her life is also to acceptbecoming a victim like she was herself. By inviting Asami to abandon her protections, he subscribed to an emotional nakedness that, to her, must take the form of suffering. It is deeply tragic, inherently shocking and a perfect display of insanity taken to a crude extreme.",Audition
147,dav07dan02,romance and horror,8,31 October 2005,"Director: Takashi Miike, Novel: Ryu Murakami, Script: Daisuke Tengan Cast: Ryo Ishibashi, Eihi Shiina, Tetsu Sawaki, Jun KunimuraThis is the first(and only so far) film I have seen by Takashi Miike. I have heard about many of his films: Visitor Q , Ichi the killer and the like as well as this. Needless to say, when I came across this at our local video store I rented it with much anticipation. This film is about a widowed film maker whose 17 year old son encourages him to date again. One night, over drinks at a bar, his co-worker(a fellow film producer) comes up with the idea of doing a faked 'audition' for a girl to play a part in a upcoming movie. The character they are looking for will be based on what kind of traits he wants in a women. After going through a series of auditions, he is immediately drawn to this particular girl. However, his co-worker senses something very wrong about her and advises him to choose someone else but he does not follow this advise.This was a very effective film. Miike does a good job of allowing for character development. This film starts off almost as a romantic love story. At the beginning of this film, we know very little about this girl or her background. As we proceed through the film we come to realize that this girl is a very unstable character. Through various dream sequences, we start to learn more about this girl's past. How she was abused by her step-father, and uncle etc. This all leads us to the horror that is to be revealed by the end of the film. This girl tortures this poor guy in some pretty nasty ways: acupuncture, dismemberment of the foot etc. His son comes in to witness all this. What I really liked about this film was the contrast between the subtle romantic like beginning and the horror that is revealed at the end. Before I saw this film, the only other Japanese films I had seen are the Grudge and the Ringu both of which are exceptional as well. I would not say Audition is scary per se. It is more of a drama/thriller than an all out scare fest. When she starts to torture him it gets a little uncomfortable but really not that bad compared to what's out there today.",Audition
148,axapvov,"Shocking movies, in general",8,20 January 2018,"I always have a hard time rating shocking films. As a concept they often disgust me but at the same time I can appreciate this kind of tales based on the darkest side of humanity rather than ghosts and fantasies. They´re far more interesting alright but, are they really that good? I´m talking about Funny Games or Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. I find Audition to be a lot less shocking than those two, but it has a sub-plot on child abuse that makes it a lot richer. It´s more subtle and nuanced too, and tries to find beauty in all of this, even some twisted romance.At times it seems this kind of films rely entirely on their shock factor but I think it´s a mistake to base my opinion on it. That would be, for instance, like rating a thriller on a plot twist alone. What about all the rest? Audition stretches the mistery for about an hour and seems to have run out of time when it finally wants to unravel it. A rushed dream sequence is supposed to get it all out of the way quickly. That first hour is supposed to be tenseful since we suspect something is wrong and yet, when it finally does, it seems to come out of nowhere, unresolved. On top of that I don´t find the torture, which apparently is the most important part, to be any more memorable than the one on Marathon Man. Certainly not enough to glorify this tale as an all-time classic. If I had time to get a bit into the mind of the girl maybe the ""deeper, deeper"" would mean more than just ""I´m gonna do this now, if that´s ok"".In conclusion, I find myself in the middle ground. It isn´t either that good or that bad. It´s a fine example of that asian horror new-wave, with enough elements to become a cult film but too vague to really leave a mark.",Audition

You could sit down and discuss what it was really about a thousand times over and probably come up with a new slant. 10/10",Audition
150,alecwest,In a word ... YUK!,1,15 July 2005,"This has to be the worst film I've ever seen in my life ... even worse than Eraserhead (and it was god-awful). The action in this film is non-existent until you've sat through one-and-a-half hours of boring and plodding dialogue. And when it gets to the last half hour of the film, it's hard to know whether you're watching something real or just a ""dream"" sequence (or two, or three, or more).Nothing is proved, nothing is solved, nothing is redeemed. It isn't even a story, really. It's just a vignette about a lonely widower who makes the mistake of falling in love with a macabre and sadistic woman and pays the price for it.Heck, I wouldn't even classify this film as good hack-em-slash-em horror. When there were still drive-in theaters, such films would come out around school breaks or at least on weekends so macho boys could take their frightened girlfriends to them ... guaranteeing them a lot of hugging (for dear life, of course). But the traditional teenage exploitation horror film would keep them riveted to the action throughout the movie. If THIS film played at a drive-in, the kids would fall asleep before the first hour was over.Far from being ""deeper, deeper, deeper,"" this film is ""shallow, shallow, shallow"" ... and not worth the rental fee much less a purchase. Rent ""Fright Night"" instead. It's a bad movie, too, but not as awful as this one.",Audition

152,redtiago,Great horror movie,8,10 September 2021,"Miike Takashi is a prolific director with numerous films under his belt. Audition is one of those that stand out. I'm not even a fan of this sub-genre of horror movies, torture like ""Hostel"" for example.This ""Audition"" was one of the first in the genre and one of Eli Roth's influences.But this one I loved, I can't even explain why.Perhaps because of the apparent ingenuity, the humour, the humanity of the characters with their faults and virtues, all of this certainly. But mainly because of Eihi Shiina's interpretation, she goes from innocent, fragile and needy to powerful and sickly sadist with an almost childlike satisfaction that disturbs, shocks and makes us laugh at the same time.It's a great horror movie, which can mark the most incautious viewers and in the end makes us wonder if we have any disturbances because we liked it.Nah, it's just cinema, good horror. Life is something else..",Audition

At the Swiss premiere someone actually passed out. This film is skillfully done by its director. It's slow start is intentional and that strategy doesn't always work in other films but here it does. A lonely father, whose wife died long ago, reluctantly agrees to stage a fake audition with his producer friend to find him a potential wife. He finds a strange but intriguing and beautiful woman who he slowly falls for. Something just doesn't seem right about this girl according to friends but he sticks by her anyway. This movie creeps up on you in a subtle and effective way. The acting and photography are superb. The lack of a blaring soundtrack made it more subtle. The only thing I'm not so sure about is when the movie gets really abstract towards its end. I think this story could have stayed with its straight-forward style but it still effected me so the director certainly did something right.",Audition
156,missraze,It was okay,7,7 July 2016,"I'm sure when this came out it was deemed a ""masterpiece,"" and it catapulted Miike to fame as a legendary mastermind and visionary, even though many of his other horror films simply don't live up to this. The untrained eye to Japanese horror or horror from a country foreign to the viewer would gladly accept ""Audition"" as a classic movie but I do not. When this film came out the hit horror films were slasher flicks mostly. And this isn't the cliché, so it probably wowed people a lot, I get that. I acknowledge how it's made others feel but I wasn't nearly as engrossed as others exclaim to be. And I've also seen worse films by Miike and better horror films by other directors in Japan. I won't say who because I'm not a promoter.This film was recommended by a former boyfriend, he rarely recommends things but we were talking about liking Japanese stuff, especially the kinky weird things. And then this filmed slipped out. He had seen it before me so I watched it on my own at first, then we watched it together. While watching both times, sorry but I was bored.What probably drew people to this film was inside a desolate tamami room, a sudden bag moving in the trailer, like a presence was inside it, and an eerie woman sat in front of it unaffected. It was a jump scare that has been played out in other films the years after this was filmed. Maybe if I had seen ""Audition"" closer to its debut date, and not 10 years later, I might be a bit more scared and scarred. But for me it was an anti-climax to see that it was a human being left in there because a tiny lady put him in? Not scary lol My boyfriend asked why I was bored with it and I struggled to explain but I said I basically don't like too complex plot twists. That I see it as trying too hard and it puts me off. He didn't really understand but oh well. I get not all horror films need to have paranormal activity, but that's truly the only type of horror film that gets me. So maybe I'm biased. But then certain psychological films that make me feel alone during and after also can traumatise me for probably life! This film however does not.It's more creepy in the sense that it's dragged out (with boring dialogue that I understand is foreshadowing maybe) and you're not quite sure what's gonna happen, so it might leave one on edge. That's a cheap tease to me. Because it sets up a looming fright and disaster but then...nothing really follows. Yes yes it IS truly terrifying to be drugged, paralysed and then tortured by someone who you trusted! But something was missing for this film to demonstrate that to ME. I first saw this two years ago from today, and normally I repeat stuff I like or need to rewatch to figure out but...I haven't done so for this. I totally get it and honestly it was a bore.",Audition
157,ellkew,Superb taut claustrophobic horror not to be missed,6,9 June 2001,"I thought I was prepared for this film having been warned about the ending. What I was not prepared for was the expertly handled tension that slowly builds and the editing style which jumps around in time. I had not seen such good handling of time manipulation since Nicolas Roeg in his heyday. Suffice it to say that Audition has stayed with me and still haunts my mind. It was extremely effective throughout, especially the bag moment and the smile creeping across her face when the phone rings. This disturbed me even more, the fact that she was sat merely waiting for his inevitable call. Some very powerful images and beautifully handled pace. The ending of course is slightly special and I agree with another comment that it would not have worked if the male/female roles had been reversed. Society is set up so that we would not accept it. So all I can say it that I recommend this film highly as it does very much get under your skin. Just don't take your sweet grandmother to see it, she might not make it to the end.",Audition
158,silentcheesedude,Yeah. Just keep watching.,8,4 May 2009,"Oh my, my, my. What a creepy movie. Creeped the ever living s out of me. And by s I mean sugary sweets I had the night before. Creepy movies, to me, are not the monster/alien/psycho killer movies, but ones where the horror lies in ordinary people. In creating a review for this movie, however, I see many comments with ""spoilers"". It's hard not to notice things like the DVD cover and plot outline. Really, you'd be a bit dense not to notice what is going to happen if you have read enough of this movie from a typical review, or have not picked up on other instances of the ending give-aways. But a GOOD movie is not one that relies on the ending to make the movie. And boy was this a good movie. As another commentator mentioned, the less you know, the better.But it's just not for everyone. Some will think it's anti-woman, or anti-dating, or some ridiculous anti-something that really has no bearing. But I think horror lovers, and for that matter, watchers of J-horror are going to really want to watch this. Ryo Ishibashi plays Shigeharu, a widower. His friend figures he will help set him up, & decide with a row of women through an audition of a fake movie. Shigeharu becomes enamored with one particular woman who's quiet, & a bit shy... so things happen, and then more things happen, and then WOOSH!, and BOOSH! and Kerplang! and then the movie ends. Yes, the movie was a bit slow at times (deliberatly) & I don't think I ever figured out what the older gentleman found in this beautiful woman half his age. Yeah, yeah I know, but really, it wasn't a sex thing...So yeah. Did I mention the director? Miike Takashi sure does have a long list of movies under his belt. Ryo is good, and Eihi Shiina, who plays the woman Asami is particularly good. I certainly got more then I bargained for. And after watching the movie I had to discuss it, not because I had questions, but because it disturbed me a little. Yeah. I say, ""Yeah"" a lot because I'm a little nervous thinking about the last half hour of this movie. I want to go ahead and think about something else now...",Audition
159,stargunner,Boring.,3,27 December 2005,"I've been scouting for good horror films, picking up titles like this recommended by this and that person, and Odishon is one of these films. Asian horror has the same elements of suspense and tension as American, but the way they build a story is different, so you usually don't know what to expect in these films. I was hoping that I would get this from Odishon. Like most Asian horror films, the first hour or so seems like a normal story. A lonely widowed man sets up an audition for a film heroine which is really an audition for the woman he wants to marry. Before the audition even happens, Shigeharu has already chosen his woman of interest from the applicants' papers. It is clear to everyone that she, Asami, is a strange woman who is connected with murders, missing persons and defunct bars. Despite this he dives into her life, and things go down from there. This movie is two hours long, but it feels like an eternity. The meetings between Asami and Shigeharu are long winded and full of things we don't need to see. People pacing back and forth, long pauses and the like. If Odishon was edited properly it could have been cut down to at least an hour and a half. Nearing the end of a film, you go from a slow paced movie to frantic, non-linear montage with some shock horror elements, the only real ""scary"" moments in the movie. Fans of Odishon would tell me I need to see this again to understand it. But I doubt I could sit through it again. I was not disgusted by it. The story was intriguing. But it was poorly played, and it's that simple.",Audition
160,Lumpenprole,"If you haven't seen this film, stop reading and go see it unless extreme sadism and violence bothers you, in which case, don't.",8,20 September 2002,"Spoilers followThe last Miike film I saw before Audition was Dead or Alive.  It was a painfully standard cop vs. sympathetic-gangster film but impressive because it begins with an unbeatable ten minute collage of music and violence and ends on a joke about the futility of the movie's own rigid formula that is apocalyptic.  I was sorta impressed with the movie.  It fought against the boredom of the plot with some wit, interesting style and several moments of gut churning awfulness.  I was not at all prepared for Audition though.I thought it would be two hours of Asami slicing Aoyama up.  Instead, Miike spends two thirds of the movie making the audience wait for it.  The film begins in sincere melodrama with a deathbed scene.  Then it takes a seedier, more inhuman turn when Aoyama meets his friend in a bar and the audition idea is set in motion.  From there much of the plot begins to resemble a horror or monster movie.  The backstory of the monster is filled in.  The antihero idiotically walks into dark rooms where he doesn't belong and won't listen to the advice that everyone's giving him.  There's even a creature-cam of Asami lurching through Aoyama's home.  Dread just seeps into plot until the part where most movies have the monster appear in its full glory (or lack thereof) for the camera.  Normally a woman whom talked too much or had sex earlier in the film dies running from the monster.  In Audition, the cheap thrill is a salaryman.  Aoyama drinks his poisoned liquor and the movie lurches into a phantasmagoric series of harsh jump cuts that unveil the Asami's past and present, his own disgusting cruelty, anxiety and finally delivers on the horror that Miike spent all this time building.  A measure of how well the savage torture/dream sequence worked on me is that when he had his `it was all a dream' hallucination, I was actually scared of what was coming next. In his moment of fantasy, the same woman in the same shots from earlier in the film, acting as passive as she had earlier, seemed like a monster capable of doing anything that Miike might choose to inflict on his viewers. If she had ripped back the sheets to reveal a bed of a thousand chomping human mouths spewing forth centipedes, it would have seemed entirely in character.  Instead he's tossed back into the real world where he's a helpless mutilated dirty old man who can't protect his son from the foolish thing he's done to himself.The film is full of gems.  The sure delicacy of the plot construction reminds me of nothing so much as Asami gingerly shoving the needles in. Eihi Shiina's performance as Asami is perfect, with just the right hints of a smile deceptively sneaking into her face and she shifts gears perfectly between the several facets of her character.  The echoing of dialogue and images throughout the film is mostly successful.  I don't think it's a great film, just an enjoyable one - it's quite a ride and a lot of fun in terms of technique.  It's about as subtle as a brick in the head, but has so much justified self-confidence that it worked, at least for me.",Audition
161,montferrato,Not exactly a Horror Movie,6,3 February 2021,"This movie does not fall clearly into the horror category. It is however, very psychological and nightmarish, dealing with trauma issues, fear and repression.
The narrative structure is non linear, and it might have a few different meanings.
At some point, the movie contains a high level of explicit violence.
In my personal opinion, there is only a scary moment, shocking and well filmed.
The plot ( or lack of it), is the weakest part.
Music is not the best.
The ending is a bit rushed too.
So, a very acceptable movie, with some good quality moments, worth your time.
Not a masterpiece though.
My impression was that the movie could have been better just with a little extra work.
This movie is listed in almost every top ten list of Japanese horror movies. In my opinion, this is not so, and this film has been overrated.

Then, in the second half, there is a scene of shocking violence that goes on forever and plays like you are watching a well photographed snuff film. It is offensive to the max in that it is as close as one can get to being pornographic violence. It doesn't just make a point and then move on but revels in the offensiveness.

The audition scenes are hilarious and reminiscent of over the top American Idol early rounds. From there, the film becomes suspenseful, mysterious, dark and finally, sickening. The movie is beautifully shot and the acting is strong. The violence to me was neither too gory nor over the top to me. It's like the violence in any Tarantino film.

Touted as ""one of the most controversial films of all time"" by RadioTimes, i was expecting tension and shocks; big things which ultimately Audition fails to deliver.Lots of people talk of the final third of the film and how fantastically clever it is, but these people fail to recall how poor the rest of the film is. It's around an hour and a half of a randy old man and a lonely, somewhat warped, young woman, and nothing happens. You wait, and you wait, and hope maybe something will come out of the blue and turn the film from below-par romantic drama into what it's touted as.But no. Maybe an hour in it becomes a little stranger; a cripple plays the piano, a girl stares at a phone, a poor guy in a sack twitches and it seems a bit pathetic. Fair enough, I don't entirely understand the final section of the film. A lot of it's guilt but some of it, such as how Aoyama ended up in her house when she was a girl torturing a music executive seems contrived, and even it is explainable, what's the point?When poor Aoyama is tortured the film delivers some of what's expected; I'd never seen someone lose a foot to piano wire before and don't intend to repeat such an experience, but throwing in torture and gore to save a poor film hopefully won't fool anyone.Avoid, avoid, avoid.",Audition

Meets a ""nice girl"", she turns out to be a total psycho.What I liked very much was the dramatic changes in tone throughout the movie, from the lighthearted audition sequences (somewhat reminiscent of similar comic scenes in, of all things, Bring it On and Ready to Rumble), to the beautifully freaky surreal middle section, to the truly sick and actually horrific ending.This movie truly creeped me.What creeped me even more was that I spotted it on the new release shelves at Blockbuster with no warning label, not even a rating. There's nothing like the look in a snotty video store clerk's eyes when you try to tell them they need to screen audiences (""over 18 only"") for a movie they can't imagine would be too gross.vague spoiler:In thinking WAY too much about what made this movie so much more creepy than many movies with similar gore, etc., I came to the conclusion that while what happens at the end of Audition would be average, even ironically funny, if it was happening to the protagonist in an episode of Tales from the Crypt, much of what made it so unpleasant in this film was that this guy did nothing at all to deserve it.

The intensity of the final torture scene and the scene where Asami feeds the man that she has been severing limbs from for years are very intense.The final 20 minutes of the movie are some of the most disturbing moments in movie history. Many viewers turn the heads away as Asami sticks needles into random parts of Aoyama's body and severs his knee.Takashi Miike shows us that horror is not all about blood and gore.

However it slowly builds in layers of creepy unsettling atmosphere, before finally launching a full on assault in the last act that will leave you reeling.The motivations and experiences of the main characters, all superbly played, seem to really have something to say about the traditions of Japanese male dominance and female submissiveness at odds with the modern world, and the dangerous psychology that can be nurtured by these restrictions and conformities. For me this raises this film not only above the level of other excellent recent Asian horror such as the much better known ""The Ring"", but easily knocks seven shades out of the current Hollywood trend for torture porn movies.

However, it was worth the wait, because for the last forty minutes of the film, things start to really get interesting. The ""thing"" that came out of the bag was just so much more frightening than I expected it to be. He had to eat vomit. Then when it gets to the torture scene I could really feel the main character's pain when each needle was pierced through his body. It just looked so real. The sound effect created when asami cut of his leg was just shittering. The best part of the torture scene for me was when asami pierced his tongue. Miike always loves to include unexpected endings to his films and I enjoyed this unexpected ending a lot. The ending was very well done though it was a little abrupt. However, there are still some flaws to this film. Firstly, the film did not explain what asami was spraying to the main character's son. Why wasn't the son affected by the spray? The torture scene could be a little longer with maybe some other ways of torturing the main character(ha ha). The first forty minutes of the film was quite boring.

Powerful filmmaking can do that.  Given a diet of typical American formula film fodder, who can blame a typical viewer for being unprepared for such powerful stuff.  Hey, my female friend and I both were simultaneously compelled to shut off the video during the now ""infamous"" scene in the second half.  We made some tea and caught our breath, literally.  Yet we both agreed that we just had to watch the rest as we were hooked by the story.  As if perfectly timed, when we put the video back on, it turned out that we had shut off the scene (and likely at the same place in the film when theatre patrons had walked out) at the precise moment the horrific scene had finished -- it is as if the director knew exactly how much the audience could stand.  Wow!Definitely a thriller.  Definitely brings to mind ""Misery"", ""Fatal Attraction"", the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movies, and the sing-song violence of ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".  Yes, I see early David Lynch in it.  And the detail of Cronenberg.  The storytelling of Hitchcock. Yes, one could say it's a homage to those great films and directors.  But that's just about the ""look"" of it.  Thematically, it's a witty caricature of and comment on modern feminism as well.  Also, it's s a tad more graphically violent than America is used to.  And I must applaud the inventive use of needles and piano string, to be sure. 
Minor quibble: Since the director went out of his way to show so much detail elsewhere, why did he stop short on the final scene involving the staircase? How cool it would have been if that scene had been presented more fully (was it a budget concern?).Besides its comment on modern feminism, in my opinion, the first main point of the film is:  Victims of abuse make the worst perpetrators of violence (which we now know is true, and about 99% of such perpetrators tend not to take personal responsibility for their actions and therefore continue them or escalate them -- but let's not quibble about percentages).  The second main point: If you don't recognize the first main point, or if you don't believe it, or if you deny the reality of it, you do so at your own peril. Funny, but this I know as a public defender.  And as a single person who dates.  Always know who you intend to be intimate with.  Like when you broach the subject of birth control in bed with someone, likewise broach the question as to whether your prospective partner has ever been abused, and if they say yes, or in the least way equivocate with the answer, RUN LIKE HELL even if it's not ""p.c."" to do so.  Let the ""fixers"" and ""bleeding hearts"" and the p.c. liberal-types -- in other words, those who deserve such fates anyway -- get intimate with ""those-who-have-been-traumatized"" and who hide their emotional issues.  Since life's too short to run a psychological profile on everyone, you absolutely must discriminate unless you don't value your time, mental health and life very much.  An excellent theme!  And courageously presented so viewers ""get it"" in their psyches.  Yes, a film that promotes mental health!This is not a typical ""date"" movie, unless your date deserves a comeuppance to knock the ""diva"" behavior out of her that evening; in which case, go for it with my blessing.  She'll hate you and you'll be spared a second date. 
Instead, bring a friend or two who gravitate to the ""wounded"" and ""violated"" when they date.  Help them save themselves.  Kinda like women and the men (the ""George Costanzas"" of the world) who date prisoners.  Or psychologists who date their patients, and vice-versa. Alternatively, and this is what makes the film a masterpiece:  The film can also be considered the ultimate feminist film, as it superbly reflects the underlying motivation of feminist thinking taken to its logical extreme.  No kidding.  The main female character could easily be a poster child for the modern feminist movement.My goodness, the film even comments on the evils of drinking and the power of flattery!Finally, I have a whole new appreciation of ballerinas and what they go through for their art.  Although ""The Turning Point"" or ""The Red Shoes"" this definitely is NOT.  We learn that ballet coaches, like figure-skating coaches no doubt, can indeed be demanding of their young charges.
Yes, I call it a masterpiece, a classic because it has multiple ""layers"" of meaning -- if one is astute enough to see it.  It provokes discussion of rarely discussed issues. In a more enlightened world, it might have even competed for the Best Picture Oscar... I would have voted for it.BTW, I bought the excellent video through WitchingHour for something like $19.Dating.  Ballet.  Modern feminism.  Needles.  Most of all dating and modern feminism.  Be afraid.  Be very, very afraid....",Audition
178,gjung01,Worth the wait to the climax,7,14 August 2006,"""Audition"" is really the first Takashi Mikke film that I have seen. After hearing a lot about the new wave of Asian films that bring extreme violence and sexuality to shocking effect, I was not sure what to expect. I was aware that it had been a horror film and that something disturbingly horrific was going to happen by the film's end but it still managed to catch me off guard. The film starts off innocently enough with a widower encouraged by his teenage son to put himself on the market and find himself a new wife since he is not getting any younger. He goes about it in a novel way, having a friend in the film business who puts on a bogus casting call to help him find a woman who will be good ""marriage material."" At this point, this film could be a light romantic comedy. The man becomes bewitched by one of the women, Asami, who is very quiet and seems to be more than meets the eye. The two start to date and see each other more and the man slowly learns little by little about Asami and a tortured past. When the man undertakes his own investigation into her past and it is learned by her that the audition was merely a pretense for him to ask her out, he finds himself in nightmare he would never have dreamed. Many will say that the film is too slow and does not give any indication to being a horror film in the early part of the film. I think this makes the final 20 minutes of the film all the more effective. We are in this man's daily life of solitude and sadness and are with him when he becomes rejuvenated after finding Asami and just as shocked and surprised by what she really is capable of doing. The performances are very good, especially that of the actress who portrays Asami, she brings a mix of vulnerability and danger that is perfect. I found myself going back and forth between feeling sympathy and loathing towards her character. There are definitely disturbing imagery and brutal scenes of torture which are graphic and not for the feint of heart. As far as an initiation into the work of Takashi Miike, this film will be good barometer for whether or not you are ready for some of his other work.",Audition
179,tenyearreunion,"Not for me, sorry, should have read some reviews!",5,18 November 2015,"Well, on the strength of the IMDb rating and the desire to branch out a little more in my film watching, I sought out 'The Auditon'.Unfortunately, though I credit the acting, the gory effects and general plot, this film just wasn't for me and I can't get 2 hours of my life back.In a nutshell, if you like mind trippy films from the likes of David Lynch, go for it. Thrillers/Dramas like Jacobs ladder, Shutter Island, martha marcy may marlene (though I was a bit irked by that ending) are fine by me but this isn't one of them. I like my films to make sense. And this, just doesn't. Maybe it's on a level I just don't get. I hope not, I'm pretty switched on but there are things in this film that are not explained and are deliberately duplicitous (to me anyway). I don't mean ambiguous, I mean they left me thinking 'I don't understand! How can things happen two different ways!?' I find this really annoying, not clever, just annoying and an unfulfilled film watching experience.I try not to read reviews before watching a film, especially if they scream spoiler alerts, but in this case had I done so I would have moved onto something else. Hence in this review I have deliberately tried to avoid any specifics about the film.Hopefully it may appeal to those who like those genre of films and watch it, and bump those who are similar to my thinking onto something else!Thanks.",Audition

181,grahamcarter-1,only through your pain and suffering can you understand who you are,8,10 June 2017,"'Audition' opens with Ryoko Aoyama dying before they can take her to Intensive Care. Her son is too late in bringing fruit and flowers; he is but a boy.Seven years later over dinner this son, Shigehiko, tells his dad Shigeharu Aoyama, he should remarry. At work his assistant reminds him she is considering getting married; there is a liaison hinted at in the past. Aoyama mentions to a TV producer friend Yoshikawa that he is thinking of getting remarried; ""to a woman that will turn a man's head, bright, from a good family and obedient with old-fashioned discipline...""Yoshikawa sets up a fake audition to find Aoyama a wife, and looking over applicants resumes one night Aoyama accidentally spills tea on one, Asami Yamasaki. She studied piano (he feels the applicant needs a skill) and classical ballet, she seems submissive in the resume as she states, ""I don't know if I can be an actress. I probably won't be selected. But I was so moved by the story I had to apply"" It is obvious he had decided on Asami even before the 'audition.' When he asks Yoshikawa what he thinks, he replies ""She has an air of tension. She made me want to smoke."" A very Japanese response, maybe. Yoshikawa ever thorough checks her references; the music producer she lists has gone missing.When Aoyoma phones Asami, he plays the Hitchcock card by showing a bag about the size of a man in her room; therefore creating suspense by letting us in on a detail that Aoyama doesn't know. A shot of the couple after dinner is pure Hitchcock with its use of rear projection as they sit in a taxi.Audition seems almost like a routine melodrama up until about the one and a quarter hour mark, where it bails on its narrative and begins to intertwine dream sequences with reality. The music becomes discordant, as Miike introduces an ex ballet instructor with no feet, the wife of the missing record producer is revealed to have been disemboweled, and they found three extra fingers, an extra ear and a tongue when they recovered the body guess what the living body in the bag is missing? We are moving towards the part of the film dealing with, ""only through your pain and suffering can you understand who you are.""Audition is quite separate in ambiance and pace to Miike's other work. He has a Fassbinder like work ethic in that you can never make too many films a year (the year of Audition Miike directed six films and one TV series!). Known mainly for the violence of its closing sequences, when Asami armed with steel wire seeks retribution for the men in her life who have systematically abused and oppressed her, Audition bears comparison both aesthetically and thematically to Dario Argento's The Stendahl Syndrome. With their long hair Asami and Anna are almost mirror images, connected both iconographically and thematically in their violent resistance to oppression. The feet sequence inspired walkouts at the Rotterdam Film Festival; however the scenes of violence are very brief, with the longest shots being the glee on Asami's face whilst performing the act. Ultimately, there are many points of view on the film; it has been praised, attacked, labeled a feminist revenge movie, or a 'screed' against Japanese societies objectification of women, neo gore film it's probably all of these things and more.",Audition
182,mindless_junk,Horror from the Heart,6,15 February 2003,"The other comments have probably revealed enough about this movie, so I will defer to them if you want to know what the movie is about.  I will only focus on my view on this movie.I have well prepared myself for the last 30 minutes of the movie, knowing what's to come from reading other comments here.  I must say that I am not disappointed at all.  The ending surpasses what I have imagined.  I found what was most powerful was not that actual torture scene at the end, but the preceding random images when the victim was drunk...  I consider that to be the climax of the movie, after those images, the torture scene becomes a ""soothing"" ending, ironically.This is not a horror based on the abundance of gore, but on the abundance of suspense and expectation.  One example will be the duffy bag at the girl's apartment.  One can't stop imagine what could be in it, and the eventual revelation of what's inside is pretty much the anti-climax.",Audition

184,ProperCharlie,Deeper.,7,25 August 2005,"** Spoileresque ** It's difficult to know what my reaction to this film is. I have several, they're strong and they're pulling me in different directions. Let me explain. This film sets off at a gentle pace. A bereaved husband and father sets out to look for a new wife when his son says he's looking lost. A friend of his in the film industry sets up an 'audition', superficially trying to discover an unknown actress but actually trying to find him the young, trained, traditional Japanese wife he would like. Just like his previous partner and not at all like those awful young, loud, girls in bars. He falls for one; an ex-ballet dancer forced to give up dancing because of a dodgy hip. But his producer friends thinks something's amiss, and he's not wrong...And so the film goes by. The director has said he set out to bore the audience for the first two thirds of the film. The producer in the audition asks one candidate if she has 'seen any films by Tarkovsky'. I'm assuming this is an aside to the audience saying 'yes, this is deliberately slow, please gently fall asleep in your seats, get used to it'. I, determined to be stubborn, enjoyed it. It sets up the characters well, especially the lead. A damaged soul, still hurting from the loss. Cajoled into looking to fill that gap by those around him, he cheers up. He fishes for her, hoping for the big catch. He looks like getting lucky. He dares to have hopes. A new life beckons and slowly builds. I didn't really think it was that slow or boring. But then I like Tarkovsky.The purpose of this alleged boredom of course, is that it all ends up with acupuncture nightmares, missing persons, child abuse and discarded digits all in graphic technicolour terror vision. If you didn't know it was coming, you would have ended up with your popcorn all over the person in front of you, including the popcorn you were contentedly digesting.It would be easy to read this film as a misandrist/gynophobic horror. It might be taken as a more specifically culturally Japanese lament for the passing of a way of life, a la 'Tokyo Story'. You could note that the jumbled chronology or hallucinatory structure of the horror segment could indicate uncertainty. Did it really happen or are those his fears? You could note that it's his son that kills Asami, the traditional (albeit psychotic) being destroyed by the newer generation. You might think that Asami is a Nemesis, born from the violent suppression of women through time.You could do all of these things however, I think it's a cut and shunt job. I like both sections on their own, but stick 'em together and it feels like I can still see the tape holding the two sets of spliced film stock together. These themes deserve exploration and I'd love to see the missing two halves to the two parts we've seen. Together it's a dislocated joint in my brain, albeit a well-executed and compelling one.Imagine the sensation if the loss and hope in the first half could have made it through to be confronted by the psychosis and nightmares of the second. Instead they're misplaced somewhere in the confusion of a drugged glass of whisky and the director's desire to stupefy us into submission. Despite Asami's philosophy of getting at reality through pain, I don't think this film was painful enough, although I can't think of any part of it I didn't like. My reactions to the film may be contrary but they don't hurt enough. Deeper, please.",Audition
185,ArmsAndMan,Wish I'd Seen This Movie in an Art House...,9,20 September 2006,"Probably the best bait-and-switch horror film since Hitchcock's 'Psycho.'What begins as a stately and formal art film that appears to be about a budding romance descends into a nightmare of gory revenge that rivals the shock value of any George A. Romero bloodbath. Only it's worse. Far worse. Closer in spirit to the true creepiness of Tod Browning. Forget comparisons to David Lynch. With 'Audition,' the audience can actually interpret the events and follow the logic of a nightmare.I start to giggle, thinking of the art house crowd who stumbled into this movie by accident. The horror, the horror.Hmmm. Maybe I'll invite some unsuspecting cineastes over for wine and cheese and a big screen viewing of the DVD.

He doesn't choose all that well it has to be said.more than just a horror film though it does manage to look at the state of relationships and what people want from each other as well as having some absolutely fantastic set pieces. at times it may drift very nearly into looking like a low budget grotesque shock horror type film but the overall atmosphere is so unpleasant that it never falls this far for too long.if you get the chance then give this a chance but two things are guaranteed 1) you will look at acupuncture differently and 2) anyone saying 'kiri, kiri, kiri' in a high pitched voice will make your heart beat just that little bit quicker!nicely unpleasant",Audition
189,Saturnfly,Someone forgot to take their pills this morning.,6,28 April 2008,"Audition is hands down a good movie, made by a great director. The scenes were shot perfectly, the actors were terrific, the story-line was some what unusual but beautiful. However, this film failed to both satisfy and disturb me. The slow build-up was necessary, however they could have gone a little bit further to entertain people such like me, who get bored easily. A good film, no matter how slow or quick, it must captivate the audience from beginning to end. I found myself pausing the film and going to get something to eat on more than 1 occasion, a terrific film will starve you of reality, it wont let you leave your seat until you have watched every second of it. I've read comments where people say they don't get it, and that it's just confusing, but the beauty with this film, is that your not supposed to understand it, or you're supposed to come to your own judgment of what is going on.Now lets get to some scenes! The vomit scene, didn't really irk me that much, 2 reasons, we didn't see the girl actually vomit, she came out with a bowel and some 'vomit' dripping over the side, that was pretty much the only thing that looked realistic. I'm not saying I like watching people vomit, and then other people eating it like it's just another meal, but common people, if you're going to make a film where it's supposed to disturb the viewer, make more of an effort, please. The torture scene, well... I was rather disappointed, you see I'm a 17 year old girl, I have a pretty strong stomach and after watching that scene I was left thinking 'what the f***? is there more?' regarding some peoples comments on that certain bit, I was expecting to see her go hard out with it all, and guess what? we didn't see her do ANYTHING, just the man screeching out in pain. I don't remember blood spurting anywhere, I mean if you have seen a film like Kill Bill Vo.1, you'll understand that a severed limb can create quite the spurt. But no. Probably the freakiest thing in this film, was when the man in the bag moved and growled or whatever it did, I knew it was going to happen, but it still makes you jump a little.However, I did like this film, it had an uncomfortable feel to it, which I admire the director was able to pull that off, it was a very good story line, but I thought they could have done so much more with it, I was left sort of left and right.",Audition

While the plot itself is nothing new (older guy falls for young, beautiful femme fatale) the presentation is completely original.  This turns out to be both good and bad.This is one of the slowest building horror movies ever.  The first hour is very tame with only a few sprinklings of terror.  When the terror does finally appear, however, it does so in some of the most effective and excruciating scenes ever caught on film.  That said, although I was unable to tear myself away from this film during viewing, I don't ever want to see it again.  The action leading up to the climax is too slow, and the latter part of the movie too disturbing and nightmarish.

There are definitely plenty of specific moments I would never forget.Just 2 weeks ago, I was discussing horror movies with my boyfriend and I mentioned Audition and told him parts of it made me feel sick and really messed with my mind. So I went on a mission to find the DVD. I came across it in Sainsburys for £7.99 in the world cinema section.We watched this film last night and it brought back so many good, but disturbing memories. The fact that Asami comes across as such an innocent young woman already makes you suspicious of her. Once Aoyama chooses her as his favourite you start to see she is not so innocent after all. The way she waits by the phone for his call and oh god that sack! I don't want to say too much as I REALLY don't want to spoil a very well thought movie.The reason I have given it a 9 and not a 10 is because the first 45 minutes of the film are a bit slow but I suppose it's well needed as it makes the final few scenes so much more shocking!Please do not be put off by the fact it's a Japanese film in English subtitles. My boyfriend and I both agreed you eventually don't realise you are reading the words anymore because you become so involved in the film.On a final note, this film is definitely one to watch.

193,neonadventure,Audition: An Unexpected Turn,8,16 June 2019,"I really expected the scary parts of this movie to occur a lot earlier but those who can't stomach those horror scenes will have to wait until the one hour mark has passed. For audiences who know that this is a psychological horror movie in which everyone would or should know by now will have to endure and suffer the wait for the scary stuff to happen (in a good way) and those who have no idea will have to endure and suffer the sudden twist in genre from drama to pure realistic horror. ""Audition"" is Miike's true masterpiece, one that doesn't suffer from the V-Cinema treatment nor any controversy but rather a kind of new way of making horror. Now I said kind of coming from a film fan who doesn't often watch horror movies but did watch The Shining enough to say that there are certainly some ideas that could've possibly been transferred here. Watching ""Audition"" before the one hour mark was rather interesting but dull for a few horror fans, watching ""Audition"" after the one hour mark was watching our main protagonist be treated with the pure hell treatment. It certainly is not a bad movie if some of you were wondering by my tone on this review, but it's painful to watch this film with the violence and that's not a threat.""Audition"" was first released in 1999 for the Vancouver Film Festival in Canada was later released in Japan 5 months after it's first screening. Starring Ryo Ishibashi which Japanese cinema fans remember him from Sion Sono's cult classic, ""Suicide Club"", another famous horror film, ""The Grudge"", and his role in a forgettable movie, ""War"" with Jason Staham and Jet Li. Eihi Shiina (from ""Tokyo Gore Police"") plays as our villainess or the main character's new wife which more people will remember her rather than Ryo Ishibashi. Also including a well known actor, Jun Kunimura, who appeared in more famous films than any one else in the movie. (Gangster who gets beheaded in ""Kill Bill Volume 1"", Tea-House Shooter in ""Hard Boiled"", Stranger in ""The Wailing"", ""Manhunt"", ""Outrage"", ""Unforgiven"" Japanese version in 2013, ""Like Father, Like Son"", ""Why Don't You Play in Hell?"", ""Ichi the Killer"", ""The Wind Rises"", and his first well known role in America was as Yashimoto in Michael Douglas' 1989 action film, ""Black Rain"") ""Audition"" offers several cinematic shots, violence, and pure horror to startle even the strongest of audience. The pure horror will be forever put into your minds like how the main character is tortured in the ending.The calm and beautiful villainess will certainly fool many of its audience with just her look. The film certainly had several raw ingredients at first and boils it down to get a delicious piece of meat that gets horror fans grateful for Miike's take on horror. He will later on direct films like ""Ichi the Killer"", ""Gozu"", and his recent 100th film, ""Blade of the Immortal"". The way Miike makes his violence in this movie is by carefully placing the materials needed for it and make the audience watch 10 minutes of slow violence that will make people vomit or leave the room/theater. There certainly has never been a better tool for horror than it's sidekick, gore.""Audition"" separates a combination between the two genres, drama and horror. This formula was also seen in ""The Shining"" which I began to see a few similarities in how both directors make up for the scares. Using this to make the movie will require the director to hypnotize its audience into thinking that it's just a drama film but completely flipping them out with the scary parts at the end. When making a scary scene now, it will definitely require a lot of knowledge on the problems with horror movies now and creativity on a way of making the audience suffer as much as possible on the main points. So far, only ""The Shining"", ""Misery"" and ""Psycho"" are films that I've seen to ever trick the audience into having them identify with the genre. Psychological horror has been a popular subgenre for over 50 years, from ""Rosemary's Baby"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and all the way to ""Sinister"". Miike dived head first into a subgenre that is so well known that it's going to take potential in order to make his film more memorable than any other psychological horror films. And he executed that powerfully.Now, ""Audition"" is by far, one of the most disturbing movies of all time according to several critics and none other than the audience or the Internet itself. I believe that this movie deserves a title higher than, ""Cult Classic"" but should be given the title of either ""Horror Masterpiece"" or ""Japanese Modern Classic"". ""Audition"" is in no way for everyone to watch and should only be in interest for those who like to have nightmares but I don't have nightmares when watching psychological horror so it was a breeze for me to watch and handle the startling content of gore and blood. With it's quick cuts into a different scene all of a sudden, visually beautiful scenes before the one hour mark, and the happy lady who gets to torture people for fun is what made ""Audition"" a haunting and fearless movie that stands above other modern horror movies today.",Audition

There were no scares or anything, but it felt like it was building up to something. I really liked the direction I felt the plot was heading, and my expectations rose up.But I was proved wrong, because the last half of the movie was a huge disappointment. Of course, twists and surprises in the plot is normally a good thing, but here it ruined the movie completely, at least for me. It became weird, and extremely confusing.

This a film that's deeper than most North American films. It's a dangerous journey into the ""unknown"" that is human beings. You will not judge books by their covers after this film ends.

The lack of music in many scenes also adds to that ""everyday"" kind of feeling. But there is alot more going on inside of one person than can be shown on the screen. The central character of Aoyama is struggling with the death of his wife, the maturation of his son, the mistakes of his past, and pleasing himself. When a beautiful woman comes into his life, she becomes everything. She takes over his thoughts and mind and seduces him with a quiet mystique, which only entices him further. The sexual power of a women, always a fascinating thing, becomes very apparent in this film as we are taken to one extreme almost beyond comprehension wrapped up in a brown sac. If this movie ever falls into your hands, if you hear the name bantered about in your circle of friends (or beyond), if you have an inkling that you can get a bargain on this flick...buy it! And as you watch, gear yourself up for a romance film. Pretend the movie is a nice slow moving, romantic-drama...Aoyama did, look where it got him...",Audition
196,craigboney,Oh my God!,7,11 June 2001,"Audition starts deceptively slowly, building up the characters of a lonely middle aged widowed guy, Aoyama.  Encouraged by his son, Aoyama realises he needs to remarry, and with the help of his friend Yoshikawa, a fake audition is arranged to attract some 'talent' for Aoyama.  One girl in particular, Asami, stands out and he starts to date her.  She seems timid but thoughtful, but gradually hints at a dark past.  I won't ruin the rest of the movie, but suffice to say if you stay patient past the first 70 minutes or so, you'll get your reward (?!) for it.  The last 45 minutes are truly amongst the most intense of any movie I've seen, comparable on recent terms with 'Requiem for a Dream'.Highly recommended (9/10)",Audition

The last 15 minutes aren't even worth watching. The hype surrounds the climax of the film, and that's not what ruins the film. The dream sequences made no sense, the story seemed to drag on forever, and the final scene is uninteresting because the whole thing is just boring, and they just decided to end the film with a torture sequence.If you want to see a horror film with a shocking climax, I strongly recommend the French horror flick Inside.

Famous for it's dramatic change of genres and for making audiences belt out the cinema feeling sick. Audition is certainly not for the faint hearted. The build up to what everyone's waiting for isn't boring, mind. It starts off gripping and stays like that (maybe a tiny bit slow in the middle) until the chilling finale. The film takes a slightly psychological path as the finale starts that makes characters morph into other characters and surroundings to change back and forth that can cause some confusion but when the torture starts you'll have forgotten about that anyway.

The appearance of the film is almost dreamlike. Immediately calming, but deceptively disturbing. Excellent use of color.

200,roundtablet,Symbolism done right,9,14 June 2018,"For some movies it is best to know nothing about them before you see them. No review, no trailer, no reading synapsis and in the case of Audition not even looking at the movie poster. Since you already did the mistake of searching for this movie and started to read a review about it I can tell you why.At first glance ""Audition"" seems to be a pretty straight forward story, which it kinda is. If you read the synapsis you know that it's about a guy who lost his wife a while ago, having an audition in order to find new love. Its tagged as horror and the movie poster shows a girl holding a syringe of some sort.. I wonder what's going to happen.... Some might say it's the most straight forward story there is, that is when you rule out the ending of the movie. Now I want to go into spoiler territory since I want to talk about the ending of the movie and go deeper into analyzing it, because that is actually why I am making this ""review""... I want to analyze the ending. If you haven't seen the movie I highly recommend doing so and then come back and finish this analysis.The movies straight forward element kinda got mixed up by 2 inclusions that were made. For one the Symbolic imagery in the dream sequence the main character ""Aoyama"" experiences after supposedly drinking poisoned alcohol and the second one being the scene near to the end where he suddenly wakes up after being tortured. In this waking up scene it seems like all of the previous events were just a dream and the girl he fell in love with isn't a psychotic maniac who likes to torture people. Now after the scene, they continue with the torturing scene, or at least what's been left of it and you see the psychokiller version of Asami (the girl I mentioned before) dying because she fell down the stairs.I read a few reviews online claiming that the ""waking up'-scene was just him (the main character) falling asleep, or fainting in the heat of the moment and he later wakes up and the events at the end occur in the real world. I couldn't disagree with that more. It for one doesn't make any logical sense, since he wouldn't just fall asleep in a moment where his son is in danger; he also doesn't strike me as a guy who would faint... the guy endured his foot being cut off a few minutes ago. Also this theory would also make that all the symbolism in the dream sequence was utterly meaningless. You know all the imagery shown, Asami as a child giving a crippled man her own vomit to eat, the reason you see her as an adult willingly getting tortured by her uncle, the reason why you see Asami killing her uncle while he plays the piano. All of this would be utterly devoid of meaning if we look at this movie from this angle.You see, there is another interpretation I have for this movie, maybe you have it as well, I haven't seen it anywhere online so I think it is rather unpopular: That all the events after Aoyama slept with Asami until the moment he woke up at the end, where just his imagination, him dreaming If you will. Now why would that be and what would that mean? It first of all means that Asami is not a psychokiller, that Aoyama just imagined her being a psychokiller. In order to understand why he would imagine her to be a psychokiller we first have to understand his character and for that, lets recall everything we know about him:Aoyama, the main character is the one we actually know the most about. The important parts are that he (of course) had a wife who had some sort of training (i imagine she played the piano) and that this was obviously a trade that he liked about her. Having a training or a skill such as ""playing the piano"" or ""dancing ballet"" is admirable for him and he feels himself drawn to such people (maybe because of his wife, maybe he liked it before he knew her). We also know that he likes Asami because of that reason, so it is rather logical to assume that he likes Asami because she reminds him of his former wife.
This is also where our main source of reasoning comes into mind. The later shown imagery highly suggest that one part of his inner psyche is not over the death of his wife and feels guilty for trying to replace her with this younger version of her. This inner self of his tries to prevent him from finding love with his new relationship.
Asami is just a normal girl basically, one with her own past experiences, the things she doesnt talk about. This is why this fear of her being a psycho killer comes into place. You see it is very easy to make yourself believe that something is wrong with someone if said person is very introverted and doesn't talk much about herself. This is why Aoyama is frightened to open up to her. What if she is a psychokiller who will eventually kill me, or worse even hurt my son? What if I am doing the wrong choice in finding new love? I shouldn't be so selfish if it ends up hurting me.
This movie has a clear turning point of him being exited and full of longing of Asami and then being repulsed and disgusted by her. And the dream sequence of his is exactly this turning point.Basically the dream sequence purpose is the inner fight between the 2 personalities Aoyama has. His damaged self, represented by the man in the bag, scarred from the loss of his wife, searching for nourishment and closure. Which makes him do things he later regrets like sleeping with his coworker, or having sexual thoughts about his sons underaged friend. And on the other side you have his side that loves his wife and what she represents, that fears for his family and for the unknown. This side is represented by Asami's foster father. The side that would stop at nothing to make him stay loyal to his dead wife that doesn't want him to find someone new. The side that even would create an image of an abused psycho killer to make Aoyama leave his new found love. And through this dream you see which side is winning the fight. You see Aoyama being disgusted and shocked by his damaged side and the moment his abusive side repeats his own words (where he says ""ore wa subarashi"" or ""you are amazing""), while playing the piano you know which path he has chosen and which side he has killed in the process.Everything after that comes as he wants it to come. He is being tortured by Asami because in his mind that's what might happen if he stays with her and his son being killed by her which would also be inevitable in his mind.And in the continuation of his dream at the end, where Asami is later killed, it is basically the continuation of his relationship with her. His fear for himself and his son's life will lead him to abandon her, wanting to never see her again. The things she says at the end would make a lot of sense if they are said after she hasnt heard of him for a long time and maybe met him by accitend on the street. It also works as a reminder of what he lost because she repreats a few lines she already mentioned.I could go deeper here and really take apart each shot and each dialogue spoken, but I just intended to give you a general idea of the symbolism of the movie and I hope I inspired you enough to do that yourself the next time you watch this fascinating movie.",Audition
201,Killer-40,Sadomasochistic Nightmare,8,5 November 2000,"See how male phantasies turn into the weirdest imagination of perverse female powers. What begins with an audition and slowly develops as a love story where the lady is to good and beautiful to be true ends in erotic and violent scenes that make sensitive people leave the cinema (and censors stare their eyes out). Takashi Miike, the cult director well known for FUDO (1996) and quite productive, explores how ideas of sexual mistreatment during childhood may lead to mixed-up preconceptions about adult's sexuality and hinder the sheer enjoyment of lust with the woman of one's dreams. But you may read the movie not as psychologically as I did it and see it as sheer horror. Ryu Murakami, famous for his TOKYO DECADENCE (1992), wrote the novel AUDITION is based on. It was serially published in Penthouse Japan and raised a lot of attention.",Audition

He gets interested in a shy twenty-four year old named Asami Yamazaki. He begins to date her, but she is really not what she seems...This is definitely one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. Extremely grotesque, sadistic, and only for strong stomachs (please DO NOT EAT WHILEWATCHING THIS). But what's unique about it is that it end so beautifully, and has a message to go with it. There's also a touch of realism to it. In the worst case scenario, this movie IS plausible. Also the gore actually looks real; it's not like the super cheap-pathetic CGI gore you see in zombie flicks nowadays. No CGI in this movie.So: Highly recommended, but only for the (very) strong stomached.My rating: 10/10",Audition
203,witness-7,Great psychological terror flick nearly wrecked by a cop-out climax,6,4 January 2009,"The movie is executed generally quite well. It really nails ""creepy"" in a very constructive way. The acting is quite good, and the build-up of the plot is certainly worth the wait -- though you need to be at least 45 minutes in before you realize you're watching a horror film.Unfortunately, the most controversial part of the movie, the gruesome and sadistic climax near the end, almost ruins the entire work. The movie was excellently executing a psychological terror/horror flick. And even with implied blood and gore, and a little look here and there, it still worked. It's this narrow balance between the implicitness of psychological terror and explicitness of physical violence that provides great tension in these kinds of stories. Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" worked so well because it didn't have to show you everything and wallow in it.But that's precisely where this movie comes apart, because suddenly Miike seems compelled to show you everything and wallow in it. And with that, the movie's psychological terror gets lost. In a scene that could have made the movie twice as powerful by cutting the scene to a tenth of its length, we're suddenly watching a different movie made by a different director with different purposes for a different audience. I felt like how an action flick junkie must feel when the director insists on shoehorning a love scene in the plot just to appeal to the non-core audience of the film.And with that, Miike scored big points with squeamish teenagers wanting to hold hands -- and lost massive points with me... and with what he had spent the prior 90 minutes delicately building. As a result, the climax is a cowardly cop-out for a movie that had no need for its brief but bizarre moment of self-indulgent excesses.It's all not a total loss, however. There's enough redeeming parts of the film that make it still worth watching. But this is one movie where the Directors Cut should really be just that: more cut, and less ""more"". At least when it comes to the film reel. Unfortunately, that will never happen, because it seems all of the talk about this film is based more on its worst scene than on the other redeeming 105 minutes.",Audition
204,LLinus,When love crushes you,6,18 July 2013,"The first thing i noticed in this movie is, the camera angles are very good, i never noticed this in movies before but this time i did it shows what needs to be shown in the situations that is appearing and give us the information about them. The beginning of the movie gives a very lonely feeling, a comfortable feeling. My impressions of the soothing sounds, when they are at the bar sitting there, sipping on their drinks, wooden shoes clapping on the floor, pages being flipped, i enjoyed these sounds. The music i would say have a classic feeling, which i like and is very calming and strengthens the emotions in this movie. This man who is the main character, named Shigeharu Aoyama, is a very kind and loving man, he and his son are very close. They get along, help each other and are open to one another, its nice to watch. His wife died 7 years ago and he haven't had a wife since. As we get further in to the movie, Shigeharu is tired of being single and what got him going was that his son mentioned that he is starting to look old and should look for a wife. Shigeharu and his friend creates a fake auditioning to find the perfect wife for him, were only girls can apply. This leads us further on and as Shigeharu plan works out, he finds what he thought at the moment the perfect women. But Asami is not who she seems to be, Shigerharu is blinded by love and don't realize what kind of a person she is. I was excited from the start, because i thought that this movie really could be something fun to watch, something different from what i usually watch, turns out i was wrong. I don't get Asians and their way of horror, they show us to odd ways to see pain and suffer that it just becomes to bizarre and unlikable, there is no excitement left in it and what you are left with is disgust, these the last things you really want to know about ways to suffer painfully or die.

So if your a big gore fan and craving ultra disturbing scenes from the get go you will disappointed to hear that Audition does not offer this. I really didn't expect it to play out how it did but it had me sucked in and hooked! OK so the main horrific part of this movie is the last half hour of the film. The first 1hr and a bit consist of a story that should draw you in and keep you hooked as there is much mystery about the 'Audition Girl.' I loved the plot and loved the characters in this film. You kind of know things are going to go haywire but you have no idea when and it kind of happens when you actually don't expect it almost. All i can say is don't look for spoilers on first time viewing and make sure you can give it the attention it deserves... watch this with no breaks, no disturbances and with time on your side.

207,chains01,Odishon (Audition),8,11 October 2009,"In my mind, Asian cinema comes up with some of the best movies you can possibly see. Unlike a lot of American cinema, Asians typically come up with extremely original and thought provoking works of art from gangster movies like Infernal Affairs, to revenge flicks like Oldboy, and even monster movies like The Host. One of the best Asian filmmakers to come out in recent years is Takashi Miike. From Ichi the Killer to the original version of One Missed Call, Takashi Miike has always been a filmmaker that helped to represent excellence. With Odishon, or Audition in English, Miike (pronounced Me-ay-kay) crafted a modern horror masterpiece that even American metal and movie horror-master Rob Zombie said messed him up when he first saw it.Audition is the story of Japanese film producer Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi). Seven years after his wife dies, Aoyama decides to find himself a new wife after the urging of his son Shigehiko Aoyama (Tetsu Sawaki). After talking to a colleague that he plans to find a new wife, his colleague comes up with the idea of holding an audition for a movie that would serve for casting the lead female role in a new movie and finding Aoyama a wife. While reviewing the candidates for the audition Aoyama comes across the profile and resume of Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) and is struck by her picture and her life story. At the actual audition he has eyes for none of the other girls besides Asami, and when the audition is over he can hardly wait to call her. His colleague has misgivings about the girl, and despite his warnings Aoyama starts a relationship anyway.Audition starts off slow going, building up characters and relationships rather than just jumping into the horror like most American films will do. This actually really helps the horror, you actually feel for the characters so when you find them in horrific situations you truly feel the horror of what they're going through. While the movie takes a little bit of time to pick up, when it does hit, it hits hard and doesn't let go, and leaves you with that, ""WTF?!"" feeling.The acting in this movie is superb. The movie mainly follows the building relationship of Aoyama and Asami, and they play their characters deftly. Sawaki plays Aoyama as a businessman having been seven years out of the game becomes obsessed with a girl whom he thinks is perfect for him. Likable, not quite sure of the moral implications of the ""audition"", and a good father who's just lonely, Sawaki plays a character with many layers and makes the audience feel all of them. Shiina, playing Asami, plays a woman that you feel sorry for and you constantly wonder what really lies beneath the surface. Slightly creepy, damaged, and also very lonely, Shiina shows that something always lies deeper in her character while not always letting the audience into what it is.I highly recommend this movie, but it's not for everyone, it's not in English so you will have to watch it with subtitles. Also there are some very graphic torture scenes that will last in your memory. For those of you who don't mind, or enjoy that type of thing though, you will be rewarded! 4/5",Audition

Also it shows the distorted man in the bag, who has only few fingers and drinks or should I say melts his face into the sick.This film has to be one of the most greatest films ever made because it tests cinemas world and also it's great because you know that the Americans will never try to remake this because it is totally above there cinema screen.There are more disturbing films like, ""Mysterious Skin and Irreversible"" I haven't seen Irreversible, but this is most certainly one of the most disturbing films of all time.

Do not read any review or any description of this film.  Just go see it.  Save the reading for afterwards.""Audition"" has provoked a lot of response here, which should indicate what this film is all about.  A lot of people claim ""it's not scary enough"" or ""the beginning is too slow"", but I think those people have suffered from the unfortunate truth that this movie is spoiled if you go into knowing it is a ""Horror"" film.  The American DVD/VHS cover is an unfortunate choice as well.The real strength of this movie lies in the disparity between its two parts. It starts out as a Japanese charmer, vaguely reminiscent of ""Shall We Dansu?"", ""Tampopo"" or ""A Taxing Woman"" in its cutesy ability to charm in a way that only the ultra-serious Japanese can charm... sort of a straight-man humor with no comedian.  This is the part of the film that people claim is ""too slow"" for a horror film.   Of course, if you go into it without expectations, this part of the film is highly enjoyable as a sort of innocuous romantic comedy and is well-crafted in this sense.Once the horror starts, it is painful to watch.  The antagonist is psychologically interesting, but perhaps a bit shallowly portrayed. However, she is certainly much deeper than your standard horror-flick dreck and the movie does a fairly good job of building suspense and being just plain excruciating in its horror half.Is this a great film?  No, not quite, but it is a good film, one that most people unfortunately do not get to truly enjoy because of the expectations given to it by the fact that we must ruin every film by genre-classification, previews, reviews, and advertising art.I saw this film with no idea what it was or what it was about, and I think that gave me a startling and enjoyable experience that most people cannot get from this film.

When this film played at a screening at the UK Frightfest some years back, the host Alan Jones told us that you had to stick with it for the ending.....and it was a movie that is redeemed by this, as the first 90 minutes or so are particularly average.A widowed husband is persuaded by his son to audition various women as a suitable potential successor to his dead wife. One of them is particularly enticing and he decides to pursue her, but her seemingly cold demeanour hides dark secrets and nature, which takes a decidedly vicious turn during the gut-inducing climax, when body parts get an unfair trial by fire and fantasy and reality begins to blur......The general reaction was a mix of bemusement and repulsion and it is a pity that the rest of the film lacked a soul, but this is not for the faint-hearted.",Audition
214,Ark-Flash,The Sound of Torture,8,3 August 2006,"I finally viewed Odishon on DVD last night. Some quick comments:The GOOD: 1) SUBTLE: scene of Asami sitting and waiting through day and night for Shigeharu to finally call. As the phone rings, we see the first glimpse of psychosis in Asami's slow and menacing smile through her dark matted hair. It also looked like a bit of drool too. 2) SICK: the dog bowl bit. Sorry read about it elsewhere because i don't even want to write about it. 3) HORRIFIC: the torture scene. Miike's long developed narrative delivers its punchline with a 10 on the shock meter. Asami looks like a demented school girl taking great pleasure as she wire saws her troubles away. We can still hear echoes of her shrilling ""kiri kiri kiri"" through the pleas of mercy. And wonder how far would the dismemberment would go if Shigehiko hadn't come home?The BAD: 1) WEAK: with the element of surprise on the son, how can such a strong psycho killer miss her mark? If she could slay, maim and imprison so many men she's definitely got some inner strength and fortitude. Also, she should have chosen a more formidable weapon than chasing him with the tiniest can of mace. A little unbelievable that Shigehiko could defeat Asami with his blind kick down the stairs although it made for a great neck twitch scene. 2) DUMB: the dumbest line of the movie, ""Dad are you okay?"" I hope that wasn't just poor translation.OVERALL: RECOMMENDED: More Good than Bad. Miike's Odishon truly left some great disturbing horror moments that will stay with me for a long time.",Audition
215,desh79,"""Words create lies. Only pain can be trusted.""",10,27 February 2005,"It's probably an exaggeration to describe Audition as extreme (its mixture of gore and realism is nowhere near as bad as in, say, Irrerversible or A Hole In My Heart), but that shouldn't sidetrack from what is ultimately a very challenging and unorthodox film. While the idea of a film changing genres midstream is nothing new or radical in itself (From Dusk Till Dawn is a good example), the way in which Audition suddenly hits you with its own surrealistic brand of Freudian horror is wholly untypical because the change in genre is not just a gimmick (likein aforementioned Dusk Till Dawn) but is used to directly comment on whatever has preceded it during the storyline.One thing which struck me about Audition is how complete and accomplished it all seems. I say this because most of Takashi Miike's work (including films I sincerely enjoyed, like Ichi The Killer or Dead Or Alive) does appear a bit rushed at times. No doubt this is in part due to Miike's notoriously insane work rate - an average of three films a year - but it makes Audition all the more remarkable. This is in no way meant to downplay Miike's other work, it's simply to emphasise the strengths on display with Audition: nigh-flawless acting, stunning cinematography, a very intelligently and thoughtfully constructed narrative, and some of the most memorable (albeit disturbing) imagery I've ever seen on film.To regard the final third of Audition as a feminist revenge fantasy is true to a degree, but I think it's also to oversimplify the more cerebral aspects of the narrative. Graham White made some excellent points in his review of the film here, and it's difficult to add anything of substance, but I personally interpreted the final third as a physical illustration of the mixture of guilt and fear Aoyama feels towards both his old and new wife; guilt at his late wife for remarrying, and at Asami for holding a fake audition and furthermore lying to all women involved during the audition (a point where Aoyama himself says he feels like some sort of criminal). In any case, people who take this film at face value are missing the point because the final third is an extended metaphor (even if the myriad of different interpretations we can arrive at illustrates how richly textured the narrative is).Unfortunately the film's ingenuity is often ignored due to its violent content, and as a consequence Audition is stuck in a double bind of sorts, too violent for serious movie goers and too intellectually challenging for gore fans. This is probably a gross generalisation of its audience, but the fact that people constantly bicker about its ""boring"" start and it's violent ending, while very little attention is paid to the thematic elements of the narrative, seems to suggest that this film has largely been misinterpreted in what it actually set out to achieve. Audition does not simply aim to comment on the state of relationships between men and women, it also aims to challenge our perception of film genre by playing around with conventions to such an effect that it deliberately shocks and destabilises its audience. Ultimately, this is what makes Audition such a challenging movie. We as an audience have become so accustomed to the lazy generic categorisations of movies that when we see a love story we want a romance, and when we see horror we want gore. Finding the two mixed up challenges our expectations and demystifies the notion that everything about a film can be summarised by the one genre it's meant to fit into. I hate using the word post-modern, but this is what ultimately what this film is, since it's very conscious of the conventions it plays with. Furthermore, this is not simply a case of romance mixing with horror, but also with realism mixing with extended metaphors, and the latter eventually taking over the narrative completely - it's very rare that this sort of thing happens in film, but needless to say it only adds to the clever originality on display here.If a mainstream audience is willing to dismiss a film as radical and wonderfully uncompromising as this simply because it does not meet their narrow expectations of what films are meant to be, and if they are unwilling to embrace a different kind of film making and widen their scope, then I expect the fault not to rest with the film itself but with the audience that has rejected it. I for one am glad to have seen it,",Audition

It's not a ""Bad"" movie, just not what I thought. It's not gory or scary at all, contrary to what's been said. Some parts can be said to be ""disturbing"", such as the female villain throwing up in a bowl and feeding it to her victim, but nothing that should shock most. This movie had all the pieces to make a better flick, but did not put them together thoroughly enough.

218,strumdatjag,Boring then Repulsively Memorable - 6/10,6,23 November 2006,"This stylish, cross-edited, Japanese horror flick takes too much time setting up for the shockingly repulsive finale. Yes, it's that finale that everyone will remember, quote verbatim (in Japanese), and try to drive from their memories in order to get to sleep for the next several days. But if one looks DEEPER (and there is very little DEEPER meaning in this film), one must ask if the entire film is truly a great movie or even a good movie. Certainly, ""the scene"", that shocking scene with the single quotable word, is one that I will remember till the day I die. It is indeed the most shocking scene I have seen in my 52 years Granted, I still haven't seen ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but I have seen ""Pink Flamingos"". The acting, editing and even, for the most part, the photography are superb. However, I found myself yawning and struggling to keep my eyes open during the first hour. The first hour could have easily been edited by half to help speed up the initially lethargic pace. Heck, this is a horror movie, not ""The English Patient"". The resulting edited 1 1/2 hour movie could have been rated an 8 out of 10. However, the 2 hour movie that I watched, and you are likely to see, gets 2 1/2 Stars, 6 out of 10.

219,kaos-23,"Cheap, gory, and silly",3,1 November 2005,"This is one of those films which would get much lower ratings if it was in English. Because it's Japanese, pretentious people think it's terribly 'dark' and 'meaningful' and 'challenging.' It is none of these things.I watched this film two nights ago and was hugely disappointed. It starts well with some genuinely chilling moments in the first part of the film. There were shots which actually made me jump and made my skin crawl. The eerie sense of not knowing quite what was going on, the slow pace, the dreamlike sequences, all added up to an impressively spooky atmosphere.However, from about halfway through, the film rapidly deteriorates. The spookiness is replaced with interminable repetition of unpleasant scenes, and essentially it becomes some weirdo's sexual fantasy. I'm not in any way a prude. I have no problem at all with sex and/or violence in films. But there also comes a point where you just think 'yeah, and so what?' The chilling, eerie atmosphere of the first half of the film is totally discarded, and replaced with pointlessly unpleasant and meaningless gore.The scene where Aoyama is tied up and having needles stuck in him, and his feet cut off, etc., is just stupid. It goes on and on and on and on and on, and Asami repeatedly says 'deeper' then 'deeper' then 'deeper' then 'deeper' then 'deeper'. If you think that sentence is boring, it's nothing compared to watching it for ten minutes (unless you happen to get off on this sort of thing - I'm sure if your fetish is watching girls pretend to be sadistic in an unconvincing way, you'll love it). It manages the impressive feat of being dull AND unpleasant at the same time. The same goes for the decapitation, the scene with the hot pokers, and so on - it's not meaningful, it's just silly.Any hint of three-dimensional characters also disappears as the film progresses, to be replaced with cardboard cut-outs. I have no idea why you're supposed to care what happens to any of them. I certainly didn't. Maybe these are decent actors, but they don't have much chance to express that with the ludicrous scenes they have to play.I have rarely, if ever, watched a film that so dismally failed to live up to the promise of reviewers. It amazes me to see the high ratings on here. I can only conclude that it's the same pretentiousness which means that subtitled films ALWAYS get higher ratings than they would in English.

Unlike the other reviewers, I was neither sick nor revulsed, but intrigued as to what else our Spice Girls/Endurance star had planned.It is not anywhere near as deep or thought provoking as David C, but is more reminiscent of a Reservoir Dogs, for its violence, and rough edges.

Like him or hate him, he gets your attention and you can't look away.What he has done with Audition is create a horror film that surpasses most of its American counterparts because it does something many fail to do - it creates characters we care about.  The characters in this film, the antagonists as well as the protagonists, are lonely people and we feel for them.  We become fascinated with their stories and honestly cheer for them to find happiness together.  When the movie takes its inevitable turn towards brutal horror we find the events happening to people that the audience has emphasized with - that's what makes the brutal occurences much more gruesome than those happening to one dimensional characters in other films.  Much like the characters, the movie itself is very hard to generalize. While many have written it off as exploitation, I think that's selling this film short.  It's a true work of art, and like all works it will have a different impression on each viewer.  Personally, I'm very happy that this film has been released to American audiences.

There are many movies leaving me thinking like that, but Audition kept me thinking for days.In my humble opinion, most reviews and interpretations of it are totally off the mark. Audition is not a lecture on feminism, or moral, or the condition of Japanese society. One can only interpret it so by deliberately ignoring its irrationality. Audition touches the realm of Jungian archetypes. At that, it's similar to Lars von Trier's Antichrist. Except that Trier's Antichrist was made 10 years after Miike's Audition and that Antichrist lacks Audition's subtlety (sic). Antichrist is strange right from the beginning, whereas Audition builds up more slowly, making its turn more shocking. Antichrist is explicit on the supernatural, whereas Audition is more subtle about it.Despite its graphic content, there is subtlety and depth to Audition. It has to tell something profound about human condition that evades petty rationalist interpretation. That's why so many people love it yet can't quite explain why.",Audition

227,captain_bungle,Pins and needles,8,13 April 2005,"A lot of people who use this site will have held an audition before. You know the feeling -voyeuristic unease as somebody acts their heart out in front of you, sometimes crying purely for your benefit. Now imagine there's no film and you're auditioning beautiful young girls with the intent of winning their hearts and their hand in marriage, whilst they think they are trying to win a part in your film. This is the basic premise of Audition, the shocking Japanese film from cult director Takashi Miike.Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), a middle aged man who lost his wife to illness years previously, tries to find the perfect woman for him through bogus auditions set up by a film producer friend. Things start well, and Aoyama falls in love with a mysterious girl called Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), but is this quiet, intelligent girl all she seems to be? The laws of horror would suggest not.Audition is a slow and laborious movie that will reward those that stick with it, although people expecting more average horror fare will probably switch off before the first half is over. Miike has constructed a film dealing with love, loneliness and infatuation with uneasy elements of the macabre, with strong scenes of torture that will repel even the most hardened of horror fans.But for all its queasiness and sadomasochism, Audition does have enough dry wit about it to give the viewer a break here and there and the audition itself is inspired; where two middle-aged men sit before tens of young women who perform in front of them and answer personal questions.Audition starts off as what could be described as a traditional love story with a modern day edge, told completely straight and concentrating all its energy into the characterisations. But it is after Aoyama and Yamazaki sleep together that things start to get weird. When Yamazaki disappears, Aoyama searches for her, encountering a bizarre character that warns him away from her before he starts experiencing unsettling hallucinations. From this point, Audition throws everything we have previously seen and got used to up in the air, casting aside normality and bombarding us with disturbing imagery, taking us on a journey where possibly anything could happen whilst we pray that it doesn't.The narrative is helped along by a strong performance from Ishibashi, who gives his character enough depth and believability that is not usually associated with the horror genre. He is a father, a widow and an infatuated lover, whose emotions drive the narrative through the slower segments and lend an emotional punch to the final quarter. To say anything more about Audition would give away the ending, as the plot is streamlined to incorporate strong, believable characters and set us up for a torturous finale. So, be warned - Audition is NOT for the squeamish. Or those afraid of needles If you've got a couple of hours spare and don't mind settling down into Audition's relaxed pace and meandering first half then I recommend you give it a go. It might not be your thing but it will shake you up, I promise you.",Audition
228,sorinapha,Every bit as harrowing as they say.,9,18 November 2015,"After watching this film, I finally understand why so many people have had such strong reactions to it over the years. It's gut- wrenching, disgusting, and surprisingly emotional. This film, a favorite of many horror directors, proved to be a wild ride from start to finish. It began on a deceptively optimistic note, playing like an offbeat romantic comedy until halfway through. Then, little signs start to slop in-- for example, camera angles that don't feel right in an upbeat setting. The people around Aoyama start to get suspicious, and that's when the film begins to slowly descend into a spiral of madness. The sounds, to me, were the worst aspects of the climax. Everything sounds more authentic than in any film of this nature I have ever seen-- in fact, to compare this to any other films feels absurd now. Is this the hardest-to-watch film I've ever seen? Not quite-- though some might disagree with me, I had a slightly harder time getting through Kim Jee-woon's I Saw The Devil (2010), but this film was decidedly a close second.Proceed with extreme caution.

Audition is basically a film of two halves. The first half consists of a painfully slow moving drama, while the second contains the meat of the story, which essentially involves extreme sadism and torture. Nice if you're into that kind of thing. While this is served with a modicum suspense, those who have experienced the delights of Ringu et al will find it a little lacking.The film is may not be without artistic merit, but it's not as good as many would have you believe.",Audition
230,Grimbleton,"A decent film, but quite difficult to grasp.",4,9 January 2021,"This review won't please everyone, but it's meant to put the opinion of a person new to the horror genre (Wes Craven aside) at the forefront, hopefully illustrating my views on 'Audition'.Everyone's always told me that Takashi Miike's films are gold, and I decided to find one to watch. I noticed that 'Audition' was available on Shudder and hit play, excited to dip my toes into some horror that wasn't just 'Final Destination' or 'SAW', but something more intellectual. After watching the film, I can only describe my feelings as a mixed bag of weariness and confusion. 'Audition' has a lot of good points, but I feel that its presentation is what acts as the primary crutch in its quest for success.The film at its core is about a man, Aoyama, searching for a woman to fill the void in his heart left by his late wife Ryoko. Being a producer for a film company and raising his son Shigehiko alone has left him a shell of his former self - dull and uninteresting. Aoyama and his friend Yoshikawa concoct a plan to hold an audition for a film and use that as a tool to help Aoyama find the woman he's looking for - a woman with talent, maturity and beauty, just as his Ryoko was. This leads to Aoyama finding a woman named Asami who's eventual background reveal shows her to be a troubled soul with a harsh upbringing. Enduring the separation of her parents, being violated by her uncle and losing her ballet career due to a broken hip, Asami's troubles have existed since her youth and still torment her. Aoyama is eager to marry this woman and attempts to understand her better, though this would ultimately lead to his demise. After spending the night with Asami, Aoyama's world begins to derail as it's not clear whether the events happening to him are the fuel of his nightmares or the very brutal reality of his entanglement with this mysterious woman. The nightmare-ish events continue until Aoyama is drugged by Asami in his house and she proceeds to paralyze him, stab him with needles and ultimately sever his feet before Shigehiko pushes her down the stairs and breaks her neck. Calling the police, it only remains to be seen whether Aoyama was able to recover from this traumatic incident or not.I've seen films like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and have a good grip on gore, but that's not what I was expecting going into 'Audition'. However, despite being an intellectual film it managed to leave me lifeless through the first two acts, an incredibly slow build-up to the reveal of Asami's true intentions with Aoyama. While there may be a lot to unpack in those first acts, I believe that Miike could have done better by making the plot more engaging than a middle-aged man looking for his Juliet and wandering into a trap of his own making. The great performances by Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina take the gold star, but the thickness of the plot is comparable to week-old oatmeal and left a lot to be desired. It doesn't contain a quick hook into the film or provide a gateway into the hearts of the characters, something that is left to the viewer's imagination even at the end. I will say however, that while the undertones of the plot are quite good and that the nuanced metaphors in-between the lines are excellent, the film is quite muddled and doesn't possess the kind of storytelling we've seen in something like 'The Shining' or 'Tale of Two Sisters'.All in all, I believe that this film may be intended for veterans of Miike's films and not for newcomers or viewers attempting to dive into meaningful horror as its plot elements and pacing are painfully slow and the film requires multiple watches to truly rip the narrative Takashi Miike wove. 4/10 for being a decent film with poor pacing and a muddled plot edging on straight-up confusing tied together by sequences with blurry lines between imaginative and real.",Audition

The acting is great and the cinematography is very classy, as you'd expect from Miike. However, he has said in an interview that he intended the first 3/4 of the film with its blackly comic love story to be snoozingly dull so that the extremely bloody and insane last half-hour would seem even more extreme than it really is.Unfortunately, I feel that it makes Audition not really worth watching more than once or twice, mainly because the main body of the film really is tedious... still, definitely worth renting, or buying if you're a big Miike fan.",Audition

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the sub-genre, ""Torture Porn"" foreign madness. But Takashi Miike's brings all of these elements into the spotlight and so much more, including his twisted masochistic approach to film-making. Miike doesn't disappoint with his 1999 film ""Audition"" ""Audition"" is about Shigehura Aoyama (Ryo Isibushi) a 50's something man who recently lost his wife. Now seven years later, widowed and left to raise his son Shigehiko alone ( Tetsu Sawaki). At Dinner Shigehiko suggests to his father that he should remarry, they discuss the apparent bespiritment his father is portraying. Shigehura seriously contemplates the idea and shares it with his friend and business colleague Yoshikawa( Jun Kunimura). Yoshikawa devises an idea how they can set up Shigehura with a new wife. Being that they are in the movie industry, Yoshikawa has a script for a film and wants to cast an audition, unbeknownst to the actresses that they are actually auditioning for Shigehura's hand in marriage. He narrows the exhaustive list of applicants down to a final thirty, the audition begins. The women come in one by one to showcase their abilities, but Shigehura is intrigued by one woman in particular, the 24 year old Asami Yamazuki( Eihi Shiina, Tokyo Gore Police). After continued suggestion from Yoshikawa to steer clear of Asami,( her references don't check out) he just has a bad feeling about her. Shigehura insists that he knows what he is doing and continues to pursue her. What he doesn't know is her past is soiled with abuse and torment transforming her into a deeply disturbed individual( a cute one though)- *Spoiler* If only he knew he would have his foot sawed off with a wire saw by her in about an hour....don't tell anyone I told you...shhh! ""Audition"" is a well paced, brilliantly constructed film based on the novel of the same name by Ryu Murakami. The introduction and development of the characters was just enough to make it through unscathed, only to reveal more later in the film to bring everything into perspective. Eihi Shiina is brilliant playing the disturbed Asami, a soft spoken, obedient women looking only to please, but holds dark secrets about her past. She is so creepy, in one scene she is kneeling in an empty room with nothing but a sack tied closed and a telephone. She kneels with her head contorted in a meditative state waiting for Shigehura to call her or vomiting in a dog bowl for her captive to lap up. She seeps creepiness and at this point in the film it seemed like the tide had turned and I was in for the Miike ride.""Audition"" is not even close to some of Takashi Miike's other films like ""Imprint"", with over the top shock.

It's obvious from the start that the sadistic Asami Yamazaki is a loony: unless the fella looking for a bride is, which is possible.It's either one or the other. Turns out it is indeed the pretty young girl who captures the attention of Shigeharu Aoyama, pervy middle-aged bloke.Two things strike me here. Although I don't condone violence or murder of any kind, there was no way I was going to have any sympathy for this weird 50-year-old bloke who, with the aid of his sneaky boss, slyly ""auditions"" girls for a film that will never be. It's simply an excuse for the pervy pair to look over young girls so that one can have his way with her - sorry with intent to marry her.As Asami begins to inflict torture on Shigeharu, she says: ""you like all the rest; you audition girls, tell them they're no good, then ring them up for sex."" And she's quite right. HE DID DO THAT. Aside from the fact this girl is clearly YOUNG ENOUGH to be his daughter, she's unhappy and suffering from some sort of low self esteem, Shigeharu ignores all advice not to get involved, and subsequently gets his just deserts.Sorry, but I can not have any sympathy for this man. He's truly a slimy specimen. We see this in flashbacks of memory, where Shigeharu has had in his subconscious, pervy thoughts about his secretary, and his young son's girlfriend who's a schoolgirl.The story, on the other hand, whilst being interesting and horrific, runs on the screen for far too long. I'd like to have duration, 1 hour 20 minutes, rather than the 2 hours it lasts for.It's stretched out way beyond it's plot...Nevertheless, 7 out of 10. But was there any need for such graphic scenes?

I can't really describe what the hell happens in this movie, besides the fact that reality and fiction are incredibly difficult to separate.After watching Funny Games, I think I've become numb to the type of shock value seen in this movie - i.e., the climactic scene when the antagonist tortures the protagonist for 20 minutes +, with no signs of revenge or help to ""beat the bad guy"" at the conclusion of the film. Much like Funny Game's, you see windows of opportunity for the protagonist to escape, but they're too stupid to realize.The thing that sets Audition apart from FG is the fact that, well...the bad guy does get it in the end, giving the audience a bit of satisfaction...unlike FG. I don't really understand people who enjoy watching movies where the innocent people are slaughtered/mutilated to death, in a very cruel fashion. Sure it's purely for entertainment or to evoke a feeling of disgust from the audience, to which the director exclaims, ""I did it! They all feel sick to their stomachs! Woo hoo!"" I guess it's a matter of morals and what you expect to get out of a horror movie, but for me, even movies that don't have good endings can be well worth my while. Take Dead Silence for example. Definitely not a happy ending, but the twists are incredible and you'll never see it coming...In the Audition, you see it comin'...all the way from Japan, and there's nothing the audience can do but ponder what the hell just happened.Pretty lame.",Audition

Nor have I been left with such a strange and extraordinary feeling after a film. This movie makes you think long after the credits roll which, in my eyes, is the sign of a great film.I'm not going to touch too much on the plot as I feel that viewers should be struck by the events in the same way that I was.This film was well shot and the suspense is built masterfully. The fact that you do not see all of the gruesome acts but instead hear and are left to envision them somehow adds to the sinister theme of this movie. Miike makes excellent use of silence and subtle sound effects throughout and the pace, particularly at the beginning, also serves its purpose.This is somewhere between horror and psychological thriller, although if you are seeking an all-out gore fest, you would be better of checking out Ichi The Killer, Tokyo Gore Police or The Machine Girl. The subtlety of the extreme depravity of some scenes is, for me, what makes this film so well made. Although it is not as gory as the 3 movies previously mentioned titles, it is by no means any less brutal.This is yet another title that highlights that Japanese movies are streets ahead of the American horror market and makes the US slasher market seem laughable. This movie is both realistic and horrendous. You could easily see this story happening in the real world and that undoubtedly strikes a chord with the viewer.If you have even the slightest interest in horror and/or psychological thrillers, you MUST see this movie.A masterpiece 10/10",Audition

You can't compare this one, and bring it up to the same level as the Guinea Pigs Films, or the other dark underground movies.However, what this movie did gave the viewer was fully sympathy for actually two characters; one is of course Shigehiko Aoyama, the son, and the woman at Shigeharu Aoyama's office, who was about to married... and here's where i lost the story.First of all; who is she? Why does she even mentions her marriage, and why does she acting like she does? And why did her role dropped out, when you had PLENTY of time in the movie to get us know a bit more about her. The second one is Shigehiko Aoyama. He shows up some few times in the movie, and one time with his new friend, but that's it. And one hero-entrance in the end of the movie. I'd love to know more about his life as well, instead of watching minutes long scenes on various restaurants.This is a perfect movie where you have a couple of characters that completely draws the viewers attention away from the main characters and the main story. In general, the whole movie is pretty silly, where Shigeharu Aoyama going blind for a girl that very clearly seem to not have purified flour in her sack, literary as well, and where his friend warns him a several times - and as for many characters in this film, he just disappearing, like fading out from the story, until we're left with only the psycho girl, the father and the son at the end of the movie. I felt something where missing in this film, and there where just too many restaurant shoots, which could be left out and instead used to let us know more about the sub characters, such as Rie, Shigehiko Aoyama, and his new friend, and the women at the office. To add the last words; showing up severed body parts, and a guy with missing body parts in a sack is NOT equal to ""the most violence and disturbing"" movie ever. Not by far.",Audition
238,Slack_Vity,Interesting,8,7 July 2006,"I heard only praises about this movie and was expecting a masterpiece as some people described it. If you're really in the mood of this film then you will surely enjoy it. Maybe Asami was a little annoying sometimes but the actress is very good as a demented-psycho. The only thing that I didn't like about this was the over-slow-paced beginning that just wouldn't start off, but anyway I was rewarded half-way through. Actors are great and the ""Kirikirikirikiri"" line will stick with you for a long time after seeing this. Just like a lot of people are saying: this is NOT a gore-fest by any kind. Don't expect a sequel of Guinea Pig or a variant of Ichi the Killer (which is great I think). Get into this movie and you'll experience something you've never felt before. This is surely something that I will buy in the future because of it's unique feeling that it builds into you.Put it in your ""To Watch"" list. It's worth the time.",Audition

By the end of the movie four of the seven had walked out!  We were still there, feeling like we had just passed through purgatory.The people walked out, not because this movie is bad, but that the violence in it is stomach churning.  It is prolonged, relatively explicit violence, that bursts out of nowhere - hitting the viewer unexpectedly.The film works as a beautiful whole and is something that is a must see! Be warned though; this is not anything like a lame slice and dice film. It is a slow burning Japanese film with subtitles about relationships that requires thought and concentration.",Audition

I was worried that Odishon would be the same.No worries: Odishon is far superior, and IMHO the better horror film. Why compare the two (other than the fact I saw them back to back)? Because both are highly hyped modern Japanese horror films about the revenge and hatred a damaged young woman takes out on the world. Odishon conveys far more horror on a more personal level without depending on a supernatural element, and I found Odishon's Asami far more terrifying and creepy than Ringu's Sadako.",Audition

A sweet love story turns into a horrifying, sadistic nightmare.",10,16 August 2000,"I've seen many Japanese horror movies, but by far this one ranks as the number one of all time. In a style reminiscent of David Cronenberg, Miike sets us up (the viewers) with a lovely, charming story of loneliness and love and we are lulled into a sense of security and comfort and then... we are torn out of our seats with excruciatingly painful scenes that made the audience at Seattle International Film Festival run towards the exits. I'm glad I stayed through the movie, since it proved to be a real masterpiece until the end. In a very un-Hollywood style, Miike doesn't give us a set, direct ending either. AUDITION leaves you with a sense of confusion that is exquisitely painful. Eihi Shiina's performance is absolutely fantastic: you'll never look at a Japanese women the same way again!",Audition
242,TheMovieCritic_83,"An intelligent, deeply disturbing film",9,2 September 2009,"Takashi Miike's 'Audition', is a film that begins like a drama, with tinges of romance, and gradually turns to absolute terror. If you aren't familiar with the directors work, this should give you an idea of what to expect...and should warn you that his films are not for everyone! Shigeharu Aoyama is a widower approaching middle age, whose son one day comments that he should re-marry (as it's been 7 years after the death of his first wife). He talks to a fellow friend in the movie business who comes up with an idea of holding an audition. The intention is for him to observe selected women, and choose one to eventually marry. Before the audition even occurs, he browses through the applicants and decides on Asami Yamazaki, a pretty, petite young woman who appears to have wisdom and understanding beyond her years.As things move along though, something doesn't seem quite right about Asami. Her references and contacts don't seem to check out, and Shigeharu's friend who organized the audition, makes it clear that he doesn't like something about her. Through shots of her sitting alone with her head down in her apartment, and a mysterious sack tied up in the room with her, it's clear to the audience that things will take a turn for the worst...and they most certainly do! Takashi Miike is unquestionably a talented and very skilled director. The film is characterized by dimly lit scenes, a minimal soundtrack, and an eerie atmosphere. One of the highlights is a scene down the staircase leading to a bar that Asami supposedly works out. It's creepy and unsettling. Even early scenes in the film, well before the horror starts, seem foreboding.This is definitely not a mindless slasher film. 'Audition' is strong in all areas. It has intellect, character definition, atmosphere, and a well written script. The earlier scenes are quite slow moving, and will probably test the patience of some viewers. However, this only increases the tension, and that was exactly the director's intent.The final scenes of 'Audition' are brutal and sadistic to say the least, yet somehow do not come across as excessive or exploitative. Either way, it's something that viewers probably should be aware of beforehand.If the film deserves any criticism, it would be towards the end during the dream / nightmare sequences. I love ambiguity in films, however, I thought in this case, it let the film down somewhat. But aside from that minor quibble, this is an intelligent, horrific, yet stylish film. You may not want to see it twice, but it's hard to deny it's power.",Audition
243,UniqueName76,"A lonely widowed man, takes his friends advice and agrees to a 'fake' audition to screen for his new wife. Nothing is what is seems.",8,10 February 2005,"This movie cannot necessarily be categorized as ""horror"" in the same vein as Friday the 13th, or Nightmare on Elm Street, I was recommended ""The Audition"" as if it were a horror. So at first I was a bit expecting crazed Japanese women running around with steak knives, but this is NOT that kind of a film. This is a suspense/thriller that is more akin with the non-linear styles of Tarantino's movies, and the same genre as Fatal Attraction and Sleeping with the Enemy.What I really loved about this movie was the carefree ""innocent"" sort of way our main character Aoyama behaves. The movie starts off a bit slow paced, but the second half of this movie gets darker, and darker, and the finale is well done. When compared to other femme thrillers like Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction that the U.S. has made, The Audition stands firmly in the lead for this particular style love/betrayal/obsession suspense style.Miike's visual style is varied, but fits so well into this movie you forget about looking at camera angles, and performances, and at least in my case I was carried and mesmerized by the movies.Some may find this movie gruesome, it is not gory in the ridiculous 'B' movie blood every way, however I found some of the scenes a bit disturbing and painful. It was very easy to sympathize with Aoyama and I thought he was very easy to relate to. Do not over hype yourself for the Audition (or any movie really) tell yourself this is going to be some dumb boring movie and just relax, after watching this movie you will have a lot to talk about.*****************SPOILER**************************** Please do not read this unless you have seen the movie. After reading the message boards there are various comments about the movie that I noticed some people did not understand. Also many people seem to misinterpret style and atmosphere as something that is completely unnecessary in a horror movie, only thing people want to see in a horror flick is body parts, blood, and violence with a thin veil of a plot. If that's all you want, this is not your movie my friend.The first half of the movie is what Aoyama really saw, his loneliness, which quickly turns into his hope as he reads Asami's resume. He falls for her without seeing her, in other words, he sees what he wants to see and nothing else. He dismisses all other potential wife candidates and had pretty much settled on Asami, his interview with her reveals he already had fallen in love with the vision of his perfect replacement wife.The conversations he has with Asami are real, he ignores all warnings and again he sees only what he wants you to see, and in reflection of that the entire first half of the movie plays out like a calm romance melodrama. Certain things make Aoyama suspicious, she never gets dropped off at home and he doesn't go to her place. Finally she suddenly leaves him in the hotel, Aoyama's loneliness and distraught returns full force and he has to find out what happened to Asami so he tracks down her old dance school and meets what you learn later is her STEPFATHER.He then comes across a bar she used to work at called the Stone Fish, a bar owned by Asami's AUNT, I suspect that the man who often came to the bar was her UNCLE but it's not certain, and it could be that the UNCLE is the RECORD COMPANY AGENT, although it's not certain. What is implied is that UNCLE or RECORD COMPANY AGENT told Asami that they loved her. Aoyama gets a shocking glimpse into her life meeting her STEPFATHER, and more disturbing information from the man who gives a brief history of the Stone Fish.The final act of this movie is really the revelation, Asami breaks into Aoyama's house and poison's his drink with a paralyzing drug. As he falls Aoyama has a surrealistic (read:NOT LITERAL BUT BASED ON REALITY) dream in which he puts it all together. You see the OTHER SIDE of the conversations he has with Asami, the disturbing side Aoyama ignores about Asami. Her abuse and her attitude don't fit, he then foresees the result of the Stepfather getting his head sawed off. Her torture and screwed up childhood. What happened to her UNCLE or RECORD COMPANY AGENT you never see his face, yet he knows he is living in that house as her pet ""Love only me"" is Asami's neurotic thought. She killed her AUNT by sawing her to pieces and leaving RECORD AGENT (or UNCLE's) 3 digits and a tongue at the scene. The reason I think the RECORD AGENT is the UNCLE is because she says the UNCLE was real bad to her, and SO WAS HER AUNT. So the scene at the Stone Fish makes more sense if it's revenge against both. In which the UNCLE who probably molested her is now her slave.In the end, Aoyama understands that he will share this fate ""You will love only me"", she throws this ""lie"" he agreed to in his face when she brings up the fact he will always love his son, not ONLY HER. She kills his dog (another love) and make it perfectly clear his son will die, and that he will be mutilated and tortured and be her pet forever.Aoyama's 2nd dream is very different from the first, that was short and sweet and was simply what Aoyama wished for, or wished wasn't happening. He went back to a time when he was happy with Asami, had his feet, and she tells him she loves him back. That's all he wanted to hear.",Audition
244,flamingyouth76,"Beautiful, terrible, wonderful film!",10,8 January 2006,"I won't over-analyze this film since it appears to have been dissected numerous times already. I'll just add a few comments from my perspective and move on.... 1) With respect to comments made that this film is boring until the last 30 minutes or so, I would say these people are absolutely wrong! Yes, it is much more slow and deliberate than most horror films, and certainly for Miike it is a departure, but boring it is not. If you find this film boring, then you are not looking for intelligent horror--you are looking for just another film in a long line of wasteful teenage crap. I cannot stress enough how important this slow buildup is. I can't remember when the last horror film I saw took time to build characters and help the audience empathize with them--and no, films like ""Saw"" that show flashbacks to help fill in characterization and obvious plot points don't count! And if you watch closely, there are myriad clues, both subtle and not-so-subtle as to the potentially dangerous situation that is being created for the male lead. This is called tension. And this film creates an unbearable amount of tension. It's been a long time since I've been on the edge of my seat waiting to see what's going to happen. Just because I am saying to myself, ""C'mon, c'mon, move this thing along"" doesn't mean I'm bored. The atmosphere in this film is positively dripping! 2) As far as comments made about this being ""arthouse horror"", my response is, ""What?!"" Why does a film have to be labeled as ""arty"" if it is a departure from what we are accustomed to? Why does a horror film have to be labeled art if it builds characterization and explores more mature themes than ""having premarital sex will get you killed by an ax murderer""? Don't let the people that call this film ""arty"" scare you off from seeing it. I consider this just a very well-made horror film that doesn't pander to the teenage audience that has grown accustomed to ""Scream"" and that type of movie. 3) While the last 20-30 minutes are hard to watch, it's not nearly as gruesome as many dozens of other films. I would argue that because we are generally interested in the two lead characters (both Asami and Aoyami), it makes the violence being perpetrated worse. I would also say that the sound effects are much worse than the visuals. Turn on mute and watch the torture scenes and see if you don't agree with me. Nevertheless, very strong stuff here! 4) Many viewers have argued about the meaning (reality vs. dream) of the ""flashback"" sequences Aoyami has. Miike has gone on record as saying his intentions were that the torture was real--not a dream. I would also point out that regardless of whether you believe dream or reality, if you pay attention, the most disturbing part of the flashbacks is that they are slightly different than the same scenes were at the beginning of the film. This basically is a statement about perspective: what one person sees and hears or wants to believe is not necessarily what another person sees/hears/believes. In other words, all the warning signs were readily available, but Aoyama was so smitten with Asami, he could not see them. That's the true horror! 5) Finally, if you enjoyed the movie on any level and felt moved by it on (again) any level, I would encourage you to search out Augustin Villaronga's ""In A Glass Cage""(""Tras el Cristal""). Same general themes (cyclical nature of child abuse/revenge), but maybe even stronger imagery. Be warned, it's strong stuff.",Audition

At the end of the movie our pal Aoyama is mourning the loss of his his puppy and his foot. Bummer, Aoyama, bummer.Anyway, Audition is among the top reasons why Takashi Miike is my favorite Japanese director. Only Miike can take a domestic dramedy and spin it into almost-Passion of the Christ territory. A better title than Audition is Passion of the Aoyama, because not only does he get put through hell near the end of it, but it's his passion that has taken to shoving needles under his eyelids.Basically, this is the movie Alfred Hitchcock's Japanese double, probably named Arfled Hichkoku, would have made if he thought mutilated growling men in burlap sacks being fed on a diet of vomit was a really cool idea.Watching this movie the first time is a bit like getting really slow, gentle head and then the person servicing you decides to bite you very, very hard, to the point that you start bleeding. And you're screaming but she/he continues biting until you have lost one of your most valuable appendages. Then he/she feeds it to your dog so it can never be sewn back on.

249,Cin-38,Truly disturbing,8,24 September 2002,"I have to say I am a horror movie buff.  Jaded to say the least.  For a film to scare me takes quite a bit.  But this film, although not able to eject me from my seat, gave me a run for my money.  The worst part about it is you don't even know it's going to be a horror movie for the first hour or so.The film is about Aoyama.  A lonely middle aged widower movie producer whose been alone too long.  Thinking it's time to get remarried (even his teenage son thinks it's time, when this happens you know its gotta happen) he begins to think of ways to find a suitable bride.  His friend comes up with the crackpot idea of holding a fake audition for a movie.  Seems pretty far fetched.  Amazingly it works!  I ought to try that.  It is here we meet Asami, a very cute, pretty young girl with a chip on her shoulder and a mysterious past.  We all know she is going to win Aoyama's heart from the beginning because he was quite smitten with the profile of her given to him. The two get together and have some very sweet moments with each other. At firstDoes this sounds like the beginning of a crappy romantic-comedy to you or what?  I can just see the American version of this now.  All they need is for her to be married or engaged to some rich jerk.  It will star either Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts as the cute and troubled audition.  Have Richard Gere as the lonely widower (a part he has perfected).  Some random, handsome, snobby British guy as the rich jerk.  It will be set in a major metropolitan city, and it will be directed by Penny Marshal.Fortunately, this is the set in the East.  Anything goes over there.  The film goes from being a cute little snorefest to a nightmarish apparition that could give David Cronenberg a run for his money.  There is no really messy gore in this movie at all, well sort of in one scene.  Something that surprises me after seeing some of the other lunatic category 3 horror movies from the East I've seen in recent times (Entrails of the Virgin, anybody) . The movie relies on hallucinogenic images and unsettling scenery to get it's scares.  Something it does very well.  The sets are very dark and foreboding.  The lighting is kept to a minimum while color is brought in shades so the characters seem to be encompassed by them.  Red seems to the flavor of the day here.  But it is a good choice, red means dread, and that becomes the feeling that comes over us as the film reaches it's sadistic climax.I have heard quite a few people compare this to Suspiria.  I must disagree with that sentiment.  Anyone who knows me, knows my feelings for Dario Argento's ""masterpiece.""  I might take a bit of heat for this, but I think Audition is scarier than Suspiria.  The lighting, cinematography, and overall feeling of doom are increased tenfold in this picture.  If you are a horror fan and haven't seen Audition, I recommend you take a look at this little gem.  However, I must warn you of one thing.  Audition is not for pussies who watch Scream and think crap like The Sixth Sense is the scariest movie of all time.  Also, it can be a bit confusing at first.  But stick with it and give it a chance or two.  Not a movie for recommendation on how good the plot is, though I found it quite good.  Most people will recommend it just on how f***ed up it is.",Audition

It is definately not for the faint of heart, but for those who can stomach it Audition is a truly rewarding experience. Because even though it twists 180, it still retains the psychological focus, and simply goes deeper and deeper, toying with your mind and perception of reality. It is ultimately a haunting masterpiece that will stay with you for weeks.10/10",Audition
251,pointreyes71,Fantastic movie that unfortunately blunders into snuff.,4,2 April 2009,"While I can appreciate the smart pacing of the first three quarters of this film, with fantastic subtlety and Miike's ability to hold back and procure many subtle, dark hints that serve to blanket your mind with uncertainty and dread, I feel that it dips into pure snuff territory for the finale. There is nothing ingenious or subtle about the way the film handles it: we find out exactly why Asami is performing her acts of horror, and it seems to come from nowhere despite previous views into her past; we know that she's had a horrific life in many ways, but her actual feeling of men wanting nothing more than to sleep with her is not congruent with how she has described her past. It feels cheap and too easy, and the actual torture techniques seem to stem from the pure enjoyment of them instead of the craftiness of the previous three quarters (the director did not want this last long scene, as I'll mention in more detail later).It's really too bad because the movie was shaping up to be a brilliant, twisted take on love and life. The brutality of the end could have been meaningful in a sick way, but just ends up being unthoughtful due to the fact that it's done in immature detail and just gets wrapped up too easily; the meaning and nuance of the first three quarters of the film get lost.What works more are the terrifying images of Asami's deranged mind when we actually see the man in the bag, etc., in concert with the bewildering (at first) and nightmarish dream-like situations that flutter and change about in Aoyami's mind after he's been drugged. I only wish that the entire ending torture scene could have been done in a smarter way so as not to come off like an insipid snuff film, which it does when the very ending simply comes and goes in a cheesy way.Apparently Miike wanted to end the film right before the entire end scene of Asami torturing Aoyama, but the producers wanted it in there (audiences can be dumb that way, yes). Nice way to completely screw up a great movie, big wigs! A very cheap and immature move on their part.",Audition
252,SntBacchus,Needs some gray area....,4,14 June 2002,"I didn't find this movie particularly suspenseful, since the entire plot is on the back of the box. But, for those who have never seen a movie, spoiler warning. Scroll away now!Despite the simplicity of the plot, I couldn't figure out why Asami attacked Aoyama until I read that it was because he copped to the fake audition. The thing is - and this turning point event is also exemplary of why the movie didn't work for me - that was a nice thing to do. She would never have found out, but he wanted to be honest. His treatment of her and other women is somewhat sexist but really fairly gentlemanly, and her reaction is completely unhinged. The torture is grisly, but so unmotivated as to be meaningless; at exactly the point when Asami's horrific past is revealed and you're supposed to be feeling for her, you're feeling sympathetic for poor Aoyama instead.Audition wants to ask controversial questions (Is this man really good, and this woman really evil?), but in the end the only real answers are ""yes"" and ""no"" respectively. David Lynch's Blue Velvet ran with a similar theme fifteen years ago, and to much better effect: Is Jeffrey a detective or a pervert, and is Dorothy terrorized by her enslavement or enjoying it? The difference is that the options are well-balanced, with a lot of evidence going both ways. Additionally, Blue Velvet develops the theme over most of the movie, giving us time to observe the characters rather than simply explaining them in a weird montage at the end.If he had been more of a cad and if she had been less of a monster, it would have worked better; but as it is I give it 4/10, with all four points being for the directing, which was far more interesting than the story or characters.",Audition
253,waitungh,"Deeper, deeper",8,1 October 2001,"Since the plot and opinion has been hashed to death, I'll get straight to what I want to say.**** SPOILER ******After watching this film my concern was on the motivation for the torture Asami inflicts on Aoyama.Clearly she is sociopathic and vindictive.However I feel Asami's overriding motivation was to be the 'heroine of today'. To feel redemption by establishing and maintaining an exclusive rapport with a lover. Unfortunately such a thing is impossible with her - she is an ugly duckling of one. So she contrives such situations - but they will always fall short because she knows in her heart she cannot be redeemed.Though she hated those who abused her in the past, such experiences were life-defining. Therefore, she feels that any relationship to someone who had not shared her load of abuse and pain could not understand the truth in her soul. Aoyama's optimistic comment to Asami that life is wonderful merely confirms to her how impossible it is for him to relate to her.Many here have picked up on the telling phrase ""words are lies, only in pain is the truth"" Indeed, it is only during the section of film when Aoyama is in tortuous pain that he is truly enlightened to Asami's psyche and all their past encounters resonate with an extended, alternative dialogue. However, she speaks those words to account for her own duplicity as well as his own.In films like 'Ring' where one of the investigating protagonists is 'psychic' such illumination is perhaps logical within the story's framework. That tortuous pain serves as an agent to confer such ability in this film takes the rational into the surreal, yet serves as a more elegant and compact device than the inevitable plodding detective-work that encumbers many psychological thrillers.Deeper, deeper, deeper.",Audition

Or is she vomiting in a plate  to  feed her savagely mutilated father whom she keeps in  a sack someplace?  It's particularly interesting the way this  movie  delves  into  the  psyche  and  ethos of modern japanese  society. In that sense its more like a documentary than  a  horror film. The main character in the film is your text-book  japanese  executive  with  all  the complexes one would   expect   him   to   carry.  Parochial,  patriarchal, scholastic,  a  work-aholic who holds an audition(!) to find himself  a  wife  who's young, subtle, pure and  unblemished and  preferably  one  who  can dance like his late wife did. This  figure  ends up, as the allegory suggests, being eaten up  by  his  doubts  and  fears.  Or as the director has it, losing  an  eye  and a leg. The issues tackled here resemble those  Cronenberg  is  usually  busy  with.  The  atmosphere however  is  not  as clinical and the imagery resembles that of  Argento's  films.

That would have been more thought provoking, instead, we were given the obligatory, in these types of ""Fatal Attraction"" movies, ""The crazy B#$ch gets killed in the end while reeking havoc on the poor guy."" That was just so...predictable.  Oh well, I hope Miike's ""Visitor Q"" is better.",Audition

This was bad in almost every way imaginable.[* Spoilers *] The story builds slowly to a horrible, elongated climax that yields no satisfaction. The torture scene goes on and on, but doesn't really scare, and is strangely empty (and I like torture scenes).The actress is good and creepy. The guy didn't do anything for me - I could care less if he lived or died.The story feels like it was about 5 lines, and they stretched it to two hours. No twists, no turns, pretty much exactly what you would expect to happen if you spent no time trying to come up with a better story.There a couple of positives - the ""kiri-kiri-kiri"" ""deeper-deeper-deeper"") chant is funny, and there are a couple of classic shots - particularly the shot of the back of her neck with her head bent, making a serpent of her spinal chord. Otherwise, no redeeming qualities.",Audition
257,siriouslysid,Beautifully twisted Perfection.,10,8 November 2009,"I sadly only heard about this movie about a week ago, I downloaded it just after hearing it was a cult Japanese thriller as i knew the Japanese are genius when it comes to the film industry, and i was not disappointed. The acting was perfect, i loved how it sucked you into the story and was very slow paced, it made the ending much more of a shocker. I also loved how the underlying theme of loneliness, makes the viewer understand Asami, i did not hate her and think she was cruel i felt pain for her. She had a life of suffering and just wanted someone to love and for that person to love only her as they would be the only person in her life, but no one understood how deeply she meant this. I think this film is a must-see for any horror/thriller fans, its not scary as such just the dark ending is really a shocker and an amazing ending for the perfect storyline the rest of the film had. I'd advise you not to read the plots and such before you watch, then the film will have a better effect. But i think it is an essential film for anyone who enjoys something different without your cliché happy ending !",Audition

When I first saw audition I didn't know what the story is about, how it was going I thought it was a romantic drama when the guy liked the woman and was going on dates with her. Then towards the end the whole story takes a turn, when you find out the woman is a psycho, it surprises you that what makes a superb horror movie. Plus the villain (the woman) you kind of feels sorry for her because of her past and you really don't want her to be evil. The point where you see her torturing her victims that's when you see her true evil side that makes her an new wave of psycho villains.The sweet innocent looking insane women villainsIn conclusion, this film is a very unique style of horror genre that put Japanese horror directors on the Hollywood map.",Audition
259,adamsmo,It just doesn't make sense - at ALL,1,8 October 2007,"Japanese horror tends to generally start off with a decent-sounding plot, but by the middle or end of the movie, it all falls apart and just ends up making no sense. There's no twisted sense of justification, there's just nothing going on that actually makes sense. This goes in the case of Reincarnation, the Grudge and its sequels. Audition is no different.Other than a disturbing scene towards the end, this movie isn't even horror. There's nothing about the character who kills to make you even suspect it, besides it being made obvious by those people who act as though there's something up with her - even though there's been absolutely no reason shown in the movie for them to have their suspicions.If it weren't for the last twenty minutes or so, this movie would be a drama. And a boring, plot less drama, at that. Just like most entertainment that comes out of Japan, it just doesn't make any sense.",Audition
260,astena,Not even remotely scary,2,30 March 2016,"There are a few moments of explicit gore, but nothing even marginally scary or suspenseful about this film. The plot is sadly kind of pedestrian, the dialogue is juvenile, the ending predictable, and I found myself struggling just to keep my attention focused on the screen. The lead actress does an adequate job of her role, but otherwise, this film is a real yawn. I'm a big fan and a bit of a connoisseur of Asian horror films, and so my opinion is not based on not understanding the twists or not appreciating Asian-style horror. But horror films should keep you guessing. They should shock you, disturb you, and the scenes should linger in your mind long afterwards. This movie offers none of those things. I suspect a lot of the reviewers who gush about what a masterpiece this film is are folks who will gush over anything that the media claims is genius, just to seem as though they are cultured and have a sophisticated sense of what qualifies as ""art"". If you want something that messes with your mind, you're much better off seeing ""Ju-On"" or the deliciously twisted ""Tale of Two Sisters."" But as for ""Audition"" being a top-ten Asian horror film, I wouldn't even place it in the top hundred. Two stars out of ten.",Audition

His wife died when their child was very young, and he has been raising him ever since, and been doing a good job.  His life has been fine up until this point, where he starts to realize how lonely he is beginning to feel. Since he is in the entertainment industry, his friend and co-worker decide to use Auditions for an upcoming movie as a secret ploy to find him a new prospect wife.The man becomes entranced by one of the auditions, and they soon hit it off, even though he finds out that most of the information she is giving him is lies, but his loneliness help him to look beyond that.  But the woman's sorted past is bound to catch up with him sooner or later.This film deals with many aspects of grief, loneliness, abuse, and the psychological damage these things can cause.  if you are a fan of new-age Japanese horror, I'm sure this film will not disappoint.

Might she be his death angel? The point is, our man chooses a ""looser"" (former ballerina who quited dancing because of injury) to manipulate her better. The real horror is this inequality in Japanese society. The torture scenes? forget it! most of us have seen better scenes...

Both Ringu are great, Audition, however, is far far from the standard Ringu set for me.The first 25 minutes it moves along in a pace so slow it would seem the intent is to put you to sleep. As the story begins to unfold, and you expect the film to do justice to its horror category, it falls flat on its bloody face and ventures into a near stomach-turning half-assed sado-orgy.
There is no suspense, thrills or excitement whatsoever. I was about to turn the bloody thing off several times but hoped it would pick up nearing the end. It didn't.Save yourself two hours of your life. The score here at IMdb is overrated in extremo.2/10.",Audition
266,kylejamescampbell,A disturbing let down.,4,24 August 2012,"I stumbled upon Audition during Film 4's 'FrightFest', instantly I was lured in for the fact it's a Japanese horror film, and a lot of my favourite horror films are Japanese. I had such high expectations for this film, after all on IMDb it holds an average user rating of 7.3. Although, it was a complete let down, and failed to live up the name that many users had been giving it, which was: 'masterpiece'. The initial problem was the opening of the film, which was bland, and extremely tedious. When creating a horror film, it's vital to grab the spectators attention from the get go, otherwise the suspension will collapse quickly, and the audience will lose interest. This film dragged in, and took more than a while to get anywhere interesting. When it did get interesting - in the last 30 odd minutes - it was suddenly over. The storyline was thin and almost non-existent in the sense that there wasn't much happening throughout a lot of the running time, and at times I forgot I was watching a horror, and it felt like I was simply watching a drama. There were so many unneeded scenes that dragged the film down and almost sent me off to sleep, it was ridiculous. The acting throughout was very average, nothing special or captivating, and there was such minimal character development for many characters besides the two main characters, even then, I didn't see a great deal of character development there, just one layered depths of personification. For a film with a running time of 115 minutes there was not near enough action or story to maintain a stable and healthy horror. The 4/10 in which I've given this film comes purely from the last 30 or so minutes in which I did - at long last - experience some disturbing scenes and images in which I was suitably shaken, and left feeling uneasy, but before I could really feel a deep sense of unsettling emotions, the film suddenly finished, and that was it. I believe that if this had come in a lot earlier and was held throughout most of the film, the film would be a more memorable and successful horror. Although right now it stands as something to be forgotten about very easily. So in conclusion: Audition is a horror full of cardboard like characters, and holds a storyline and plot that fail to create suspense throughout, fail to keep a sustained sense of fear or eeriness and comes across as a dull, monotonous and lifeless excuse for a 'horror', subsequently becoming one of the least scary horrors I've ever come across. Not to mention the poor and lazy attempt at 'acting'. Which leads me to wonder, why people seem to love it so much?",Audition

So when I finally got my hands on it I was prepared to see something interesting... to no avail. The first 90 minutes of the movie were SLOW AS HELL and could have been done in 30 minutes if it was done well. The plot was amazingly flawed (who asks someone to marry them when they don't even know where they live?), and the ending was just terrible.

The long build-up, that seemed like something out of a completely different film genre, was nicely played. You found out the main character's motives for holding the audition, and you begin to really like the character, he seems very innocent and likeable. The film is very different to the usual American 'kill-a-minute' type 'horror' films.The final 20 minutes, assuming you have the uncut version, are a real shock to the system - and you will really be left trying to work out what was real, and what was not.Note: The film does contain some scenes that, if you are squemish, you would be best to avoid.

270,ambiguousnightmare,Beautiful until...,8,4 January 2014,"This film starts as a delicate tale of romance. You might even feel deceived when a sweet romance blossoms instead of a horror film. Asumi, an seemingly delicate little flower is played beautifully. Any man would be enchanted by her bewitching eyes, silken hair and soft voice. Shigeharu Aoyama's son is suspicious of Asumi and plays the role of detective to discover more about the mysterious lady. This is when the film turns into a thriller as it is revealed that everything is not quite what it seemed about Asumi. This film has a very long build up to one of the most infamous scenes in horror. If you watched this film completed unaware of the dramatic and gory ending then the level of violence and how graphic it will come as quite a shock. Due to this one moment I would be careful about who I recommend this film to. Gorehounds would be impressed and arty film viewer. The film is beautifully shot and has substance I might recommend it to other horror movie fans with a warning about extreme gore. It is a beautiful horror movie that works with or without that one famous scene. Don't be put off by the ending, just close your eyes and listen instead.",Audition

It's the anti-romance film, one that slowly forces the audience to endure the characters' wrenching misery until it assaults the audience with brutal and graphic sequences during the climax that serves to punctuate a thoughtful, if not deliberately paced thriller.",Audition
272,omg_a_baby,Zzzzzzzzz...then splat,3,24 June 2010,"Hmm.. I really didn't enjoy this movie. Throughout most of the movie, you'll find yourself falling asleep. The movie progresses extremely slowly and feels like a boring love story at first. As the storyline progresses, you start finding out a little more about Asami's past, which peaked my interest enough to keep watching this movie. Frankly, I was only curious to see what was inside this lounging burlap sack she kept in her room, but that was probably the only interesting part in this movie.If you manage to stay awake long enough, the movie slaps you with a hardcore, explicit torture scene at the end (I guess this is what we were all waiting for?) If you cringe watching the Saw series, then this movie is not for you. The ending is FAR more sadistic than any of the Saw series could strive to be. Watching this ending was like listening to nails on a chalkboard. If you aren't bothered by the gore, you will at least be somewhat disturbed at how happy someone can be when they're mutilating their victim.Overall, yeah I guess there were some cool psychological twists in this movie, but they held it all off until the near end/end of the movie when I was already more than ready to turn this movie off. The only thing that drove the storyline forward was this Romancey kind of plot development. A few randomly disturbing scenes/flashbacks would be sprinkled here and there but I was already bored out of my mind to feel anything.This movie wasn't my kind of movie, but you might still enjoy it. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest reading a plot summary and then fast forwarding to the end. There really wasn't anything useful that happened in the beginning, except a dragged out romancey approach that failed to pull me into the movie.",Audition

I recently read a true story about a guy who strangled his girlfriend and left the body in his car trunk for months. Why should this movie be so shocking if it happens in the real world. People (including kids) get chopped in pieces for real, all the time. The gore scenes look just so real.And it's not too long either. I saw this film already knowing the end would be shocking so that sort of spoiled the whole experience but still ""Audition"" is a really good film, not for all tastes. The gore scenes are overhyped but still shocking. I definately recommend this film for those who want to be shocked or be surprised. I loved the way the viewer is betrayed (I really was hoping the poor guy was dreaming it all). After seeing the film, I somehow feel sorry for Asami and at one point you start to understand why psychopaths exist in this world.

278,Llama-King,A horror classic.,8,17 February 2009,"If this is not yet considered a classic, thenwell, I never thought this far, but I think you get the point. People may complain that Audition is too slow-paced, but I suppose that these people are simply accustomed to most horror, in which the filmmakers often seem afraid that they'll lose the watcher's interest unless it's a shock-a-minute. Takashi Miike's film is scary because it is not horror. It's suspense, which is much scarier than horror could ever hope to be.Yes, yes, it starts off like a love story, thus annoying those who assumed it would be all about torture and gore. Well, this only makes it that much more shocking when it begins to turn. And when it turns, that b*tch seriously f*ckin' turns! One reviewer, Glenn Lovell described the film as being like ""a swan dive into a pool of spikes and razor wire."" I completely agree.Some may say it's too slow, especially if they're accustomed to Miike's other works, such as Ichi the Killer, but I honestly loved it. The slow pace simply allows tension to build, and build, and build, one frightening inkling after another, until it reaches a terrifying, uncomfortable climax.However, don't think it's all great. Miike tends to really test your patience at points (which I suppose is kind of the point), though not enough for the film to be considered too slow. And, just as in many other Asian horror films, some parts are justweird. Probably intended to be scary, but come off as a bit random and at some points very confusing.Not to mention, one would expect a bit more character and plot development from a film with a slow pace such as this. It does a great job with bringing it's psychotic antagonist to life, really make you unsure whether you should feel bad for her or be afraid of her. She seems more real than most movie killers, and certainly more understandable. It's lead, however, remains an archetype, a protagonist more than a person.However, this is not quite enough to keep it from being a great film.",Audition

If you watch this movie smoothly, then your on the road to become the best surgeon in the world. The acting is also brilliant; needless to say the actors are excellent. If you compare this movie to Oldboy, I'd say Oldboy is slightly better than this one.

As a matter of fact it will contain very little information about the film itself. The film starts out as your typical love story. Man loses wife and then auditions girls for a part in a film. The audition is not for a movie it's actually to find this man a new wife. It is the movie equivalent of taking a Sunday afternoon drive that suddenly turns into a horrific car accident. It is one of the truly great all time horror movie. Though not in the conventional sense. It has more in common with David Lynch than Tobe Hooper. This is one of those rare films that can truly creep you out. Part of its genius is its pacing. This is a very slow film. It builds and builds to the shocking climax. Essentially it is about an hour and half of not much happening and about fifteen minutes of gruesome terror. As cliché as it sounds. This film is not for the weak at heart. It is very unsettling. This is not fantasy horror with people getting hacked to pieces and blood spraying everywhere. This is ""this could happen to you"" horror.

And can I say I have never been more disappointed. The pacing of the film is all wrong and serves to bore the audience into a stupor for over an hour just so it can shock them with 20 minutes of gore at the end. Had some of the flashbacks been longer, or introduced earlier in the film it could have been more effective, but as is the film had no suspense.Because of the mind numbingly slow pacing, and general lack of genuine scares this movie is a big let down. I watched ""3 Extremes"" fairly recently and thought that ""Cut"" had become a tighter more horrifying experience in comparison to watching the original. ""Audition"" would also benefit greatly from being from a re-cut to make it shorter, tighter and quicker paced.If you are looking for a shocking and disturbing experience there are literally hundreds of better films to choose from. ""3 Extremes"" would make an excellent choice as you get 3 shortened (though not any less horrific) films all of which are much better than audition.",Audition
283,paulbaker_508,Chilling yet thought provoking,9,8 June 2004,"Miike Takashi's film is a superb example of the increasinglypopular genre now as 'J Horror'Although I should point out that it is not a good starting place for newcomers.The tone of Audition is quite remarkable.It starts off as a film about a widower who runs a small business.His teenage son thinks that dad should start looking for a newwife.Further egged on by a film producer friend of his, they put togetheran audition for young, attractive actresses for a film role that doesnot exist.It is said that these kind of fake auditions are often used by men inthe film industry looking for a new girlfriend or more commonly, amistress.If the girl they date mentions the role, they claim there is troublewith the financing that has delayed the whole project.The irony here is that the main protagonist is clearly uncomfortablewith lying, and has his arm twisted to go along.The girl he does fall for and subsequently dates, seems a littleodd but with great depth to her character.What slowly unfolds is that this girl has gone through hell.Sadistically abused whilst practicing ballet for her disabled andperverted uncle. She later suffers the trauma of having tocompletely give up dance by an injury.She is well aware of how budding young women like herself areused.What we see unfold is her turning the tables.For me, what works best about Audition is the subtle clues it givesyou, as it moves towards what you expect to be a disturbing finale.Well, it does not disappoint..The girl has an ingenious way of getting even with men who woulduse her.Ingenious, immaculately planned and so cruel as has to be seento be believed.I can't help wonder why it is only in the far east they seem to able tomake extreme movies that are so superbly produced and acted.Half way through, you could be forgiven for thinking that this film isa romantic drama. Yet by the end, everything makes sense in a satisfying way that istoo often absent in western horror /thrillers.For me, I found it a fascinating study of the everyday duplicity andlies that we are all engaged in to get what we want.Most people seem to think that they are not worthy enough to fulfilltheir dreams and therefore have to lie and cheat their way tosuccess.If Audition doesn't persuade you of the dangers that stem fromdeceiving people, particularly women, in order to use them, thennothing will.This film is 'adult' in the real sense.

I won't get into details, but I will mention that the last seen is truly as horrifying as everyone has indicated in the postings here.  For me, it was not the act in itself that freaked me out as much as the attitude of Asami during all this time.  Check out her face when she has her wire in hand going to work.

It was also essential for the effect of the last 20 minutes or so to be as powerful as it was.  A point I felt this film really ran home, was how quickly and easily you can become desensitized to violence. I won't post any spoilers, but I expect those of you who've seen it know what I mean.I'd have to say I wouldn't have given it 5 stars as many magazine reviews have done, but I'd give it 4. The reason being that I DID feel after a while like there was a certain element of 'shock factor' which didn't enhance the film.",Audition

Seeing Audition in the sold out Luxor-theater(with over 1000 people) was definitely this years highlight. A gruesome, fascinating, horrible, bizarre and brilliant paranoid nightmare.Of course you don't know about that in the first half of the film!
The film starts as a strange story about a man trying to find a new wife by setting up a fake audition for a movie. Strangely enough it works, and a romantic story unfolds. But watching the film something seems to be wrong. And when a big sack starts moving in the girls house, you know that trouble is coming.I won't tell you what happens (watch the movie!). But during the screening in the Rotterdam filmfestival a big part of the audience left during the screening in compete panic, climbing over the chairs, shouting ""let me out"". The people that saw the whole film will for sure never have acupuncture again, or look at piano wires in the same way. But the experience was worth it.What a movie!",Audition

I have to say, even from the quite sweet and innocent outset, I had a deep seated sense of dread and doom which increased with every foreboding minute! I think this is achieved by the brilliantly detached and formal style the director adopts and also the simplicity and subtlety of all the characters. However subtlety is not a word you can use to describe the horrifyingly (almost) unwatchable final 20 minutes, that is, the very bloody, icing on the cake!

This film is disturbing to the point that after you watch it you will never be the same person ever again. Having said that, ""Audition"" is also one of the best films EVER made, let's face it the Japanese film industry is a million times better than Hollywood could ever be. Japanese genius Miike Takashi once again shows the world how amazing he is behind the camera, his trademark brilliance shines all throughout ""Audition"" as his fans and cinema lovers have come to expect from him. It is true that there are thousands of films which could be classified as disturbing but what makes ""Audition"" excel is this area is the fact that the first hour of this film gives you no clue as to what the final half hour has in store for you, the only way you could know what to expect is if you have read the book itself by Ryu Murakami. The final half hour or so of ""Audition"" will leave you breathless, it is just the most incredible climax i have ever seen, incredibly brutal incredibly powerful incredibly compelling and amazingly directed with intensity never before seen on screen. I urge everyone who hasn't seen it to watch it straight away because if you don't you will only be depriving yourself of one of the most fantastic films ever! altogether now...Kiri, Kiri, Kiri, Kiri",Audition
295,jp80-552-991433,"Kiri, Kiri, Kiri, Kiri!",10,4 April 2014,"In it's essence Audition is a somewhat clever and twisted love story which explores the physical and mental damage that can be caused by relationships and the way with which humans treat or mistreat each other.'Shigeharu' is a lonely man and widowed following the loss of his wife, when his son suggests that his father should begin a new search for love. With a fulfilling career in the movie industry Shigeharu decides upon an 'audition' for a lead female for a role in a new movie. Both the role and the movie are make believe and Shigeharu is actually auditioning the pretty females for his next love.Upon interviewing the long queue of ladies, Shigeharu whittles down the applicants but is ultimately drawn to and spellbound by the beautiful and mysterious 'Asami'. The two begin to date and it becomes clear that Asami has some dark secrets hidden inside her. Whilst some of those closest to Shigeharu feel that Asami may not be all that he believes her to be and warn against his pursuit of Asami, their advice falls on deaf ears.For 80 minutes or so, Audition offers an intriguing insight in to the human aspects of dating, love, emotional scars, desire and acceptance for one another. There are a number of aesthetically beautiful scenes which weave between the real and dream like sequences. Audition also has some genuine scenes of humour and dark humour but the more sinister undertone to Audition bubbles up to boiling point for an horrific finale which will throw most viewers, leaving mouths agape and jaws on the floor.As a film maker Director Takashi Miike is no stranger to controversy but he is a genuine master of combining the bold and the beautiful, with Audition being one of his finest examples of this. For anyone wanting to experience a genuinely thought provoking story of love played out in the guise of a horror/thriller, Audition is a must see.",Audition
296,leospitt,"Good film, not as extreme as I expected",7,10 March 2006,"The main reason I saw this film was because I kept on hearing reviews saying that it was incredibly extreme horror, how people found it unbearable to watch, fainted during screenings, etc.I thought, this is a film I must see, since I've not yet had to stop a film due to being grossed out or scared, or at least not in my adult life.In fact it isn't really as hardcore as I had been led to believe. If you've seen films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or even a recent mainstream horror film, then you're probably going to be able to handle this. It's just a bit more sadistic.It's perhaps a shame that it has such a horror reputation. Judging by the video sleeve (girl with syringe), this looks like it's going to be a cheap gore-fest. Actually it's quite a classy film. The first three quarters build the tension very well, with a subtle script, good performances, and so on. It's an interesting movie, treading an unusual line between drama, thriller and horror, before eventually deciding to be an all out horror flick in the last quarter.My main disappointment would be that I actually preferred the first parts of the film to the horror last parts. It's shaping up as a fascinating psychological thriller.Asami's character is being developed into a very interesting one, who you feel sympathetic for at the same time as afraid of. The relationship between the hero (whos name I forget) and Asami is very well presented. It's a bit of a shame perhaps that in the end she is basically reduced to a psycho slasher, and the nuance is dumped as a result.Definitely worth a look. I'll probably watch it again.",Audition
297,punksmon,A horror masterpiece,10,15 December 2019,"As with much of Takashi Miikes work this one is a slow burner taking it's time to leisurely introduce the audience to it's world and characters.
Miike likes to set up one movie and then suddenly switch it up and throw something totally unexpected in the audiences face and while the twists and turns of audition may not be as totally nuts as some of his other works this one will definitely have u squirming in you're seat.
A difficult watch at times for the weak stomached for sure as Miike relishes making his audience uncomfortable.

298,che59,Fantastic,10,4 May 2001,"There has never been a film like Audition. The best way to describe this breathtaking new horror flick from Japanese director Miike Takashi would be: Sixth Sense as directed by David Cronenberg only better. Takashi's film starts as a simple family drama about a lonely widower's search for a new wife but quickly descends into the kind of surreal terror that leaves its audience unsure as whether to laugh or scream. Indeed, so effective is Takashi at lulling his audience into a false sense of security that you'll almost definitely end up doing both and sometimes at the same time. At it's most basic core Audition tells the story of a father played with exceptional skill by Ryo Ishibashi who is left alone to raise his twelve year old son after the slow and painful death of his wife. The relationship between the two is undeniably close and when seven years on is son innocently suggests that it is time he found a new wife the father whole-heartedly takes the advice. Feeling it might be hard to find the perfect woman in modern Japanese society the Ishibashi character enlists the help of a producer friend who immediately offers to stage a fake movie audition in which Ishibashi can take his pick from dozens of young women.So far, so good. The audition takes place, humour ensues and the audience is treated to a veritable array of beautiful, talented young ladies some of whom seem perfect while others simple prove comedic in their feeble attempts to land the fictitious lead role. There is one woman in particular who catches the eye of Ishibashi. Dressed in white she appears to be everything that the widower is looking for in a woman: beautiful, modest, obedient and strangely melancholy. Like Ishibashi she has experienced a death' of sorts and her understanding of its necessity in life appeals to him in a way that can only be described as obsession. All goes well. They date and he even decides to ask for her hand in marriage during a weekend away at the seaside. However, before he has a chance to propose they make love and when he awakens later that evening he finds she's vanished without a trace. At this moment Audition changes beyond all recognition, no longer is it a charming tale of loneliness and repression but it becomes one of the most graphically disturbing, harrowing films you'll ever likely to see.Through fear of ruining the film let me just say that there is much, mush more to Takashi's masterpiece. Ishibashi's frantic search for his young beau not only leads him to uncover a whole lot more than a web of lies, disturbing hobbies and an abusive childhood, it also forces him to confront fears that neither he or the audience ever knew existed. What's worse it begs the audience to question whether all they have just seen is really what happened or simply a twisted vision of a repressive, male orientated society as seen through the eyes of one lonely man. Audition is flawless in all that it does. The direction seems effortless and the acting is far beyond the reach of most Hollywood stars making it a must see for anyone with a true love of cinema. A word to the wise, however, Audition is not for the weak hearted and some of its brutal imagery may leave you changed forever.",Audition
299,reverse_hsalf,It's gratuitous.,2,16 October 2001,"While being a well made film, you are drawn into the characters sympathizing to some point with them. However the main scene which is the entire crux of the matter is wrong. Surely 30 long minutes of the torture of a innocent man is gratuitous. The whole argument of her being justified as fighting back for all the women who have fallen for the casting couch trap is benign if not why murder the dog, why attempt to kill the son. The dog though was the main sticking point for me. If there was some sort of idea that killing the dog would bring about some anguish from the main character, then the director has already failed as he doesn't get to see the dismembered puppy. The film transformed from potentially the best horror ever made to something utterley repugnant. and for those REAL MEN out there that are saying I've seen more disgusting movies than that or the director should have shown more gore.

The pretty maiden is a sight to behold (clearly she is not a tattooed trash from Texas or Kentucky) and her appearance is the catalyst for the set-up, which is the contrasts between expectations and the deceiptful appearances.Back to the complexity, the film does go into an extended segment that is hard to swallow, harder to understand and requires patience and conjecture, but ultimately it all rewards the viewer as the last 15 minutes make this a scary as heck horror - and by horror we mean horror not Hollywood race war shlock or teen franchise masquerading as ""scary.""",Audition

I usually don't get this affected by a film.

I still feel that way, but at least among all the boring nonsense, there's some good blood and guts. Not that I get tingly from blood and guts, but honestly, why else would you watch the Guinea Pig films? Now I've read many reviews, hailing Audition as the greatest horror movie ever, and the most disturbing film ever and yadda yadda yadda.So as I sat through an hour and a half of confusing dialog at a snails pace, I was thinking, ""well at least the climax will be shocking/disturbing/bloody/whatever."" Bloody? Yes. Disturbing? Shocking? No. Compared to run of the mill Hollywood schlock, yeah, sure, it was pretty grisly, but the ""most disturbing picture ever""? Hardly. I could name a dozen films off the top of my head more disturbing than Audition. Nekromantik, Cannibal Holocaust, anything Fulci has ever done. Sh*t, even the Hills Have Eyes REMAKES left me a little unsettled. Audition? Not even a little. It left me with the feeling ""Thank God that's over. Am I retarded or something for not liking this crap?"" If you want to see what all the fuss is about, go ahead and watch this film; I mean it's not terrible.

Part of a reviewer's job is to give a brief summary of the story, so the reader can tell if it's something they'd be interested in. But I feel like I'd be cheating you all if I said just about anything about Audition. So if you are feeling adventurous and don't mind watching something a bit different, check out Audition. If you really want to hear my thoughts, go ahead and read on.Bizarre is the best word I can think of to describe Audition. We start with a romantic comedy. A father decides to remarry, and so he holds a movie audition to find his perfect woman. Everything is happy, and very enjoyable (I even laughed at a couple scenes). But once he does find his perfect woman, things get a bit weird. Things aren't quite like they should be and you notice an odd tension in the air.What I'm trying to say is that Audition is a horror movie.And boy is it scary. I consider myself to be fairly good at stomaching horror. Most movies that my friends find scary I laugh at. Audition is the first movie in years to actually make the walk from the computer to my bed frightening. This movie combines gruesome violence with psychological horror perfectly, so that even if it's difficult to watch, you know that's not what makes it so scary.This is what makes Audition so interesting. It starts out as a happy go lucky movie, and slowly crescendos into pure terror. By the end, you won't know what happened, where it happened, or when it happened, but you will know that it was intensely interesting, and extremely scary.Yes, this review is muddled and doesn't really tell you anything.

This movie isn't anywhere close to a horror, sucks as thriller, I knew from the very start what'll happen, so practically wasted almost 2 hours of my life, I highly suggest everyone that fancies good horror movies to NOT waste your time watching this. Story: 3/10 Acting: 1/10 Camera: 1/10 Overall: 1/10 Summing it up, I can say that this movie is worse than Twilight, or any movie that I could think of to bring up as a comparison.

308,buddah-ess,This is the perfect horror film PERIOD,9,10 November 2012,"I have literally just finished watching this film and it has everything needed to not only scare, but disturb and confuse anyone who watches it. There is something hypnotically surreal about this film that, no matter how dark it gets, it is physically impossible to take your eyes off of it.Above the amazing performances, the excellently framed shots and mise-en-scene, as well as a brilliantly crafted narrative, the highlight for me has to be the use of the sound. Most contemporary horror films are stuffed with suspenseful musical build ups to the now horribly clichéd ""jump-scare"" whereas ""Audition"" barely has that much music at all; there is mostly silence. But when it does have music it is perfect and uniquely. I have never seen a film before that uses serialism before (and I watch a lot of films...) The only reason I give this film an 8 and not a 10 is because it is missing something. Not to spoil anything because I highly recommend anyone who sees this review just to watch it without even looking anymore into it but I don't feel there is any real resolution (which is clearly done on purpose). But even so, I just feel the film as a whole would have benefited a lot more if there was more a bit more sense about, not the plot, but who exactly the characters are in the context of what I read as on a first watch as some form of Japanese symbolism.Regardless of my one and only criticism, this film is the closest thing to cinema perfection of the horror genre I have seen.

It will be a happy day when the fabulous Italian Horror Masters (Argento, Bava, Etc,) and the very fabulous Japanese Horror Masters (Miiake, Nakata, etc.) are finally given their due in America. God knows they get copied enough by our American directors. I'm very anxious to see what comes of the American remake of Dark Water.

311,borisduende,A walk through a painting,10,29 October 2005,"This movie is truly a work of art. None of the other Takashi Miike features goes even close to this masterpiece. The movie is beautifully shot and the use of light and color turns it to a dream-like sequence that gives you the impression that you are walking through a painting.Well, a haunted painting.Takashi Miike uses a very ""lynchian"" approach to light. When anger, despair, hopelessness are the dominant feelings in the scene, he splashes this macabre bloody red, usually through a sunset or a fireplace.In the other case of madness, ice-in-veins cruelty or simply hibernating rage, he sinks everything in this inside-the-dark-freezer blue.I like very much his techniques, and so I liked the plot and the story.I always pay more attention to compositions, masterful camera-work or color and pacing than to the strength or believability of the plot. You can tell a stupid story in a fascinating way, but it's unforgivable to tell a fascinating story in a stupid way, you know.Miike has proved himself a master of psychological horror. The love story is so beautiful and romantic until the twist, that you somehow find yourself emotionally involved and you start to really sympathize the characters. Most of Miike's other movies are satirical, bloody, non-romantic, over-the-top violent or just extreme, but this one is like a poem, a hymn of despair, a blood-covered warning sign, standing before the true love that we all strive for. And it is a postcard from hell. Deeply recommended. There's a scene  Asumi standing on the white balcony watching the sea and Aoyama watching HER from the inside of the dark room. That scene is now printed and hanging on my wall, for it's one of the most beautiful artworks I've ever seen.",Audition

The woman he picks and starts to date does not turn out to be the shy, fragile girls she seems to be.Takashi Miike lulles us asleep with an excruciatingly boring and utterly passionless story of love and family life and then tries to catch us off guard with a bloody and gruesome finale.With flashbacks, Miike shows us why the woman has become the monster she is, but does it give us any real insight into her feelings, her psyche? Can we appreciate her sad life story? Do we feel any compassion for her? No, no, no. In the end, she's just a monster. The things she went through as a child just seem to be another horror movie, with her uncle as the monster.And the man? I just thought he was stupid and naive in the extreme. The girl's story doesn't check out, and there's obviously something 'wrong' with her. Warned by friends and even by his late wife in a vision, he still goes through with the relationship, and then becomes a helpless victim of her true nature.Without being backed up by interesting characters or a gripping story, the admittedly horrifying ending turns out to be nothing more than some heavy duty blood and gore.

What did come as a surprise was the sheer genius use of timeshifts and the beauty of the ""images"" the movie provides.Tension is built up masterfully and the leading actress has to at the very least be credited for her performance.

The first two-thirds of the movie were understated and enjoyable but the finale disappointed. The final scenes were reasonably gory and a number of people left the cinema muttering: ""I can't take this any more.""Gore alone however is not enough to make a good horror movie great - the movie should linger in your mind for the next few days and especially in bed at night. It should have some psychological impact. Audition fails this test - the conclusion is no worse than watching a toenail being removed (although this is pretty grim in itself).

318,LeonPro,"Only for Miike Fans. A Cult, not Art House.",4,10 January 2003,"I purchased the DVD from recommendations and comparison with Hitchcock's Psycho.  No matter how many times people try to justify what this film is about  with all those descriptive words and analysis on what kind of genre this movie  belongs to (or that this movie is about the views on women or humanity in general, etc.) - one thing is certain, its BORING! SOME SPOILER... I know this isn't a horror/gorefest movie or a romantic movie.  Reviewers have  been trying to justify the boring setup of the first 2/3 of the movie in order to  highlight the last 30 minutes of torture on the protagonist. That doesn't make  sense to make a boring movie of that length.  If all you have is a nice ending -  make a short. I love watching movies - from shorts to epics.  Long, subtle movies centering on  human relationship?  No problem.  I loved watching movies of international directors from the likes of Godard's Masculin, Feminine (French), to Beresford's  Driving Miss Daisy (Australian director), to Mann's HEAT (American).  They were  all long AND entertaining. How can this even be compared to Psycho (and Vertigo)?  I don't think Hitchcock would appreciate the comparison.  All the movies of Hitchcock were storyboard to the last detail.  Editing and Cinematography was painfully planned  - each scene had a purpose down to the wiper blades in Psycho. Everything about this movie has faults. I understand the editing is supposed to be jerky to mimic hallucination (which I  appreciate for the last 30 minutes), but the rest of it only distracts the viewer  more. Cinematography is absolutely bad.  The strong reds, greens and blues puts the  audience on edge as it represents the various moods and hallucination. But its absolutely horrible to put all those strong colors in one scene. Like the scene  where they go out of town.  Give one character a color, and the other another.   But make it subtle!  Audiences are not stupid.  They can detect subtle color changes to represent parts of a movie or character phase. The script is bad.  Why?  There are too many loopholes and questions unanswered.  I've watched this movie twice for two days straight just to analyze  the intention of the director.  Sure it has psychological aspects all through-out.   The movie is supposed to be jerky and shocking, but don't do this by confusing  your audiences even at the end - which is supposed to tie all the loose ends.The antagonist is a psycho who mistakes the protagonist to have the same intentions as her other suitors.  So she tortures him, despite the director showing  us all their romantic conversations and the genuine feelings of the guy. Suddenly she goes to his place and explains what she thinks he is.  Huh? Again, despite all the flashbacks of their romantic conversation over and over  again?  If she is a psycho, make the audience show her how she wanted to torture him by finding out from his friend, whom she tortures first because he  reveals to her and suggested the whole fake audition. You want to watch a Japanese psychological thriller?  I strongly recommend PERFECT BLUE.  This will keep you on edge until the end. As for this movie, not even worth renting.",Audition
319,Martin Lau,Better than the hype (notes from a sensitive child).,10,18 May 2002,"I finally rented Audition today after wondering whether or not to see it for months (I'd been curious about it since it came out in the cinema). See, I definitely do not have a strong stomach, and I'd seen it advertised as a ""Screaming gore fest"". Now I'm glad I saw this excellent film, and I may even take another look at it, although that's not how I felt straight after seeing it!Many reviews I have seen say that you should avoid any spoilers to feel the full impact of this film, and I agree with that. My personal choice was to see as many spoilers as possible, as, being rather a sensitive fellow, I didn't fancy having nightmares for years after. (Of course, I now realise that I was falling for the hype to a degree). Still, despite knowing the storyline before seeing the film, I was suitably disturbed in all the right places.While a lot has been made of the violence in the film, it is clearly not about brutalising the viewer; I don't think it is gratuitous at all. Toe-curling, yes, but not exploitative. Also, some of the most disturbing moments do not actually involve graphic violence.Possible mild spoilers:I think it is a little inaccurate to say that the slow buildup is just about lulling us into a false sense of security. That would imply that it just serves the infamous torture scene. The film flows and fits together very coherently, even when the intended effect is disjointedness. This to me is a hallmark of fine film craftsmanship, what Tarkovsky, who is referenced in the film, called ""sculpting in time"". I was impressed with the scene where things really start to fall apart in the story, and the director constantly crosses the ""line of action"", allowing us to share in the main character's confusion.From this point on, things get pretty surreal, and this is cranked up a gear when our hero arrives back at his house, unaware of what is waiting for him. You could almost say that the climax of the film is extended from this time until the end, and of course it includes the torture scene. However, if I had to pick one key moment, it would not be the explicit torture, but rather the very end of the film.End of spoilers.I was expecting to be gagging and trying to shake the horrible images out of my head when this film was over; instead, I was left very moved, and in a strangely ponderous mood, which is the most I could ask of any work.So, I would say that ""Screaming gore fest"" does not even begin to do Audition justice, and probably aims at it an audience that might not appreciate it. As to whether to recommend it or not, all I can say is that I had built up the violence in my mind beforehand, and watching it didn't turn me into a raving lunatic after all, so perhaps avoiding this because of the violence alone would mean that you would be missing out on an outstanding film. (Of course, anyone who didn't know what was coming would be knocked for six just by the violent images, but there's so much more to this film than that). It's your choice whether you want to see this genuinely disturbing movie which is made with a huge amount of humanity. Personally I wouldn't show it to a squeamish person who didn't have any idea what they were in for. Oh, and don't even think of showing it to the kids (I'm not sure why I feel I have to say this!).One last thing. If you didn't read the slight spoilers above, be warned that just about the worst thing on every level that you could do is to walk out of this film or stop it before the end.",Audition
320,Wildcardvideo,Audition - A Twisted Romantic Comedy?,7,12 October 2006,"In AUDITION, Japanese cult film director Takashi Miike (YAKUZA DEMON, ICHI THE KILLER) takes a romantic comedy movie plot about a lonely widower (Ryo Itabashi) trying to find true love by holding an 'audition' for a fake reality show and twists it into an unimaginable horror film which critics say, ""makes FATAL ATTRACTION look like a simple misunderstanding.""With this movie, Miike does a fantastic job of doing the near impossible. He builds a sense of dread; The kind that makes the hair on the back of your neck rise and your skin crawl. How does he do this? He makes you wait. He takes his time. He sets up his story. He introduces his characters and then begins a slow build to the movies gory climax.Does a slow paced movie sound boring? It's not. AUDITION will have you on the edge of your seat, making you slowly inch forward as the movie progresses. Clues are dropped, telling us all is not as it seems. The 15 minute climax of this one is a combination of shock, revulsion and outright horror.Being a fan of Japanese horror movies, I was glad to see the care and attention to detail that Lions Gate/Maple Pictures lavished on this Uncut Special Edition DVD. The packaging and presentation are very well designed. The DVD liner notes look great and feature a Takashi Miike biography, a filmography and a slick montage of production stills. As for the DVD itself, the 16:9 widescreen film transfer is is sharp, the Japanese 5.1 surround sound mix clear, and the English Subtitles are easy to read.The special features include an introduction to the film by Takashi Miike (in which he warns the viewers to turn off the DVD if they are feeling sick), an in-depth interview with Miike, a disturbing scene-specific director's commentary, an interview with the original author Ryu Murakama, a gallery of chilling photos, and finally a clip from Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments featuring Eli Roth and Rob Zombie.",Audition
321,tuomasvilhelm,Unbalanced and boring,5,5 October 2009,"The slow tempo or scarcity of the gory scenes were actually very good things in the film. The director has wisely decided to build lots of tension and develop the main characters for the first half of the film instead of wasting ketchup. It's respectable as today's target audience of the film industry are illiterate juveniles...The ambitious combination of the romantic drama and horror/gore seems to a little big bit to swallow for the director as he completely fails to revitalise the classic femme fatale theme by any means. It tells the same familiar story the European masters of the literature and film have told so many times already. On the other hand, the little blood splattering that's included in the end of the film is effective and certainly way too scary for someone who hasn't used to see blood and guts. This is why film can't be recommended for everyone.However, It ends the film in very abrupt and unsophisticated way. The main character's difficult childhood would be an understandable explanation in the court but it is barely adequate for someone who expects an artist to be able to show us something new and different about this world..something we wouldn't know already.",Audition

It is extremely boring and hardly entertaining for the first 3 quarters of the film. When things finally start to happen, it's over. Maybe if I had seen this when I was 10 years old, it may have scared me a little. Besides a couple short lived scenes, there's nothing that would make even the most fragile individual flinch; unless, of course, they're jerking out of a calm sleep. The thought of the basic premise is more disturbing than the film itself, which has only a few images that will stick with you for a while.

There has been a lot of hype over this movie and I was expecting something scarier or just more shocking. The first hour and 20 minutes are pretty boring, some will claim it is to build tension and for character development, but I didn't see that done very well. The last half an hour are drug induced flashbacks and and some pretty gruesome scenes. Sure, the gruesome scenes are cool but kind of unrelated to the rest of the movie. At the same time, I didn't see that much character development to make me want to care about the characters: in the final scenes I wasn't that shocked or angry about Aoyama getting tortured. The cinematography is average, nothing to brag about, and the acting is overall unimpressive.I've watched some Japanese movies but this one didn't impress me.

325,tarinj-h,A well made Cult Film.,8,28 March 2013,"I recently watched this for the third time, and decided to watch it with my dad. The basic story-line is a man's wife dies, and years later he decides to re-marry. His friend says he will hold auditions to find him a new wife. He finds who he thinks is perfect, and she turns out to be psychotic. As the film played through, many things were commented on. Mostly the use of colour and clever story-telling. At the beginning of the film, it's very bright, with lots of pale colours and much white, a good example is the initial audition scenes. As the couple's dates progress, things begin to darken, metaphorically and literally. During one date, they are sitting in a restaurant, although Asami is dressed all in white, which would portray her as quite innocent, the background is black, which shows that she is a lot more sinister underneath. Continuously the colours darken, the last scene being very red. The use of story-telling is very intelligent in this film, it links everything together so no questions are left unanswered, but it does so through dreams and suggestions, rather than it being said out loud. I did feel that the film began to drag until its bloody conclusion, and it took a long time to explain what was happening, but I also think that may have been necessary for the subjects the film deals with. This film mainly focuses on jealousy and abuse. How abuse can affect a person, and how jealousy can lead to many worse things. My dad commented that he thought Saw was much more 'disturbing'. I can see where he may be coming from, as Saw is much bloodier, but this is more the power of suggestion, and is far less fantastical than Saw. I feel that this is more disturbing the more you watch it. An absolute must for any cult fan, or true horror fan.",Audition

327,Gothik_Jen,More subtle than you might expect,7,19 January 2006,"Many people who name drop this film often refer to it as a 'gore fest' or mention that it is very bloody and violent. However, I think you should see this film for yourself before reading too much in to those rather superficial analogies of this film. This film has many more subtle layers than violent scenes. The violent sections are much less overt than you might imagine.I think the appeal of Asian cinema to some people is that they can access new levels of violence and degradation  areas that are otherwise censored in Western cinema. If you are a thrill seeker looking for the shock factor this is perhaps not the film for you.There is much to be learnt about fantastic cinematography and stylistic direction from the Asian cinema greats. I believe there is a sense of holding back some of the full force of any extreme action or emotions in this film, a characteristic I find present in a lot of the better Asian cinema. I think this is where the appeal of Asian cinema lies for the other half of the audience  in the implied elements of the film. You are free to read as much in to it as your imagination will take you, an essential element to many of the more 'high brow' genres of film. This is what makes you think about a film for many years after having viewed it, and audition is definitely a film that will stay with you.",Audition

Generally i enjoy Japanese horror, but this was simply a waste of time and a loss of two hours that I will never see again. What a galactic disappointment.

331,MarekHahn,New directions in cinema,9,9 March 2001,"(Contains possible spoilers) This is a strong impressive movie, which employs many fascination details to create a stirring atmosphere and an awesome story (O.K., enough adjectives). I heard some people saying this film is great because of the surrealistic atmosphere but I think this is like saying, Yeah Crime and Punishment from Dostojewski is great because it is a great crime novel. Of course it is but there is more to it and so it is the case with Odishon. The difference between this movie and movies from Cronenberg like Naked Lunch is, that Cronenberg often employs bizarre effects for it's own sake while in this movie they are used in order to enlightening the meaning of the movie. This is a movie about a man who looses his wife and a long time he can't get over it. Then he decides to marry again and through a rather odd way he encounters a mysterious woman. He tries to know her and falls in lover with her. But when he makes his effort to marry her she disappears. After some hard attempt to find her she returns but not in the way he expected. From the point, when he tries to regain her the movie uses the surrealistic effects, some very hard scenes and breaks the former story into pieces. Now, my idea is that the movie is about this:  the man wants to get over his pain (he tragically lost his wife) by marrying again. So he looks for another person who experienced some kind of tragic too. He makes the mistake that he too fast thinks that he knows the other person, her feelings and her pains. While he thinks he had understood her in reality he projected his own feelings into her.  While he thinks they are two hurt souls who can understand each other because of this in reality there is a deep gap between them and he understood nothing of her. The surrealistic scenes at the end tell you how vague your own impression of reality can be and how different it can look from another point of view. The painful scenes are a symbol for the man's realization how strongly he had misinterpreted the situation and how he looses confidence in believing if he can ever trust his own perception. The key sentence is when the woman is torturing the man and tells him: `Only pains are real, words don't mean anything.' This works so well because a lot of time is put in action to know the man very well. Because of the moving family scenes at the beginning I felt very sympathetic with the man. He makes the crucial mistake to become acquainted with another woman through some kind of a contest (This turning-point is, what the title Odishon / Audition means). So he treats the woman as objects and he has to pay for it. This is all the more dreadful because his uneasiness about the situation is well described. There is so much to be said about this movie and how well it uses every detail to underline the basic meaning so I can only mention some of them. First of all this film owns a lot to Hitchcock's Vertigo. In both film we have a man who went through some kind of traumatic experience. Both meet a mysterious woman to whom they fall in love and whom they loose in the middle of the movie. In both movies the story now starts afresh. Finally in both movies the men detect that their own feelings to the other woman depended on severe misinterpretation and lack of not focussing too much on themselves. Secondly the movie was often praised for his great camera-movement. And indeed it is great; sometimes I had even the feeling that the beauty of the shot disturbed the story. But I think  this is used at the beginning to emphasize the man's sorrow about the loss of his wife. It is the same beauty, which Tarkovsky uses in his movie Nostalghia to underscore the man's homesickness to Russia. An evidence for this is when Aoyaina's best friend asks during the audition one woman if she knows Tarkovsky. And if you look for some other great shot experience than you have to look Tarkovsky's Nostalghia. Thirdly some camera-movements are indebted to David Lynch's Twin Peaks as far as Bob is concerned. Before writing another 800 words I will close and I hope somebody will read this at last. Finally I would be happy if somebody wants to discuss this with me and I'm eager to be told if she or he found something useful in my comment.",Audition

The story itself was only semi-interesting, and if it had been made by someone who wasn't Takashi Miike, the entire movie could have easily been a disappointment. The thing that makes this movie great is that it doesn't ""leave stuff to the imagination"" and it does a good job of that.

342,lisa_trevor_protoge,A Beautifully Macabre Journey Into the Depths of Madness.,10,27 July 2008,"Odishon delves much deeper down into the human psyche than the typical psychological horror film, making it much more of a dark, artistic drama and less of a slasher movie, even utilizing satire in creating the doomed, sinister romance of the protagonist, Aoyama, and his new love, Asami. The movie is mostly known for its infamous final scene, in which Asami tortures Aoyama . However, ""Odishon"" provides introspect into the deranged places of emotion: obsession, and vengeance, going much deeper than frames of dismemberment with barbed wire and uncomfortably placed needles. 2/3 of the movie is utilized in the intentional boring of the viewer, while building upon Aoyama's ill-fated infatuation with the enigmatic Asami. The viewer is consistently reintroduced to the often guilty and confused feelings which plague Aoyama throughout, while the masked elements of Asami's personality, which remain nearly unapparent until the scene in which the contents of her bag are revealed, are indirectly revealed through discussions of her past. Thus, the entirety of the movie becomes important. After the period of well-disguised foreshadowing, the viewer is introduced to one of the most disturbing, yet ultimately engrossing, scenes ever, in which Asami drugs Aoyama and proceeds to torture him through increasingly macabre methods. All in all, there is very little to criticize in Odishon for the astute moviegoer, especially one who enjoys both bloodbaths and intelligent drama. However, those looking for a movie with cheap, gory scares, a quaint romance, or the typical Hollywood drama ought to look elsewhere.",Audition
343,ctheokas-1,Genius film-making,10,28 November 2002,"Small spoilers ahead, but nothing to give away the great stuff...I saw this in an art house theater in DC, and it was perhaps one of the best experiences simply watching a movie I have ever had. First, the film is incredible. It's the story of a movie producer whose wife dies in the opening scenes. Cut to seven years (or so) later, and his friends and family are worried that he's not getting past her death. So the producer's best friend sets up an audition for a movie that doesn't exist. The producer takes the resumes of the women and picks the one he thinks is the right one for him. Then things go bad.Miike starts it out with the tone of a typical romantic comedy, then turns it into a horror/thriller type film. That made it great. What made it genius, to me, was how he dealt with the violence. Miike has a reputation for mega-gore, and rightly so. But here, you don't really see what happens - or, you see the violence administered, but you don't see the results at first (think of it like this: Clint Eastwood shoots his gun. You don't see the gun, you hear it. And you don't see the bullet hit, but you hear it. Then you see the result. It's the same here, except there are other instruments, and no guns). Plus, the climax scene at the end Miike uses a POV shot that puts the viewer in the place of the victim, and I thought it was very Hitchcock in that way. That's what made it genius for me.
But, as with other Miike films, it's not for everyone. During the screening I attended, five people walked out at first. While they were walking out, one man fainted. The lights went up, and another five or so people walked out as well. Not because it was bad (like, say, The Master of Disguise), but because they were the faint of heart.",Audition
344,gunnsalius,Very good...,7,8 July 2011,"More of a shrine than a window display, the Takashi Miike movie posters outside Suspect Video in Mirvish Village prove that the Japanese director is the new king of cult auteur's. No other filmmaker pushes the envelope of good taste so vigorously or so often. Churning out as many as seven titles a year, Miike fills his movies with surreal acts of sadism and perversion. Even the most jaded video addicts -- the sort of Travis Bickles who consider Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer a good first-date movie -- salivate over the prospect of Miike's latest outrage. What's next? Another yaks war that ends in global apocalypse? More of Visitor Q's cocktail of incest, necrophilia and unlikely lactation? Or how about a femme fatal even deadlier than the wire-toting beauty in Audition, the 2000 film that receives its belated Toronto theatrical premiere at the Royal this weekend? Despite his reputation, Miike is no gore-crazy vulgarian. His shock tactics often cloak sophisticated interrogations of narrative and genre conventions. That's the case made in Agitator, an extensive new study of Miike's work by Tom Mes, a writer for the webbing Midnight Eye. In his analysis of Miike's 50-plus movies since 1991, Mes examines recurrent themes like nostalgia, family and representations of violence. Understandably, Mes laments how difficult it is for Western viewers to get a full sense of Miike's range since relatively few of his movies have circulated outside Japan.Miike's international breakthrough came five years ago when Audition played festivals in Vancouver and Rotterdam, where it caused some audience members to flee, faint or vomit. (And you thought you had a rough time at The Matrix Reloaded.) Such a reception would suggest that Audition is a full-throttle freak out on the order of Ichi the Killer or Dead or Alive. Instead, it's the sensitively rendered story of a lonely widower (Ryo Ishibashi) who reluctantly allows his friend to set up a phony movie audition in order to scout a new mate. They're after someone ""beautiful, classy and obedient"" and Asami (Eihi Shiina), a former ballet dancer, seems to fit the bill. Whereas most directors would telegraph what's to come (think of all the obnoxious fake-outs in What Lies Beneath), Miike is less interested in creating a thriller than a drama about the tragic situation of two lovers who, like any couple, can never completely know each other. The fact that their story culminates in torture and dismemberment somehow heightens the film's poignancy. Hey, maybe this is a good first-date movie.",Audition

The film starts off as almost a romantic film, and throws you down a rabbit hole of betrayal, gore, and fear. If you have ever been single, and had an interest in meeting girls on the internet, this film is very prevalent to todays society. If you have the right patience to watch this film, you will come out very satisfied, but one major complaint from most viewers is that the film was too slow. It is without a doubt the directors intention to slow down the pacing and get the viewers more involved. Overall I would suggest anyone and everyone who has ever been lonely at one point in their life to take a look at this horrific masterpiece of a film.",Audition

It does start, well the first half of 2/3 or so, SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW. I mean slow! I just about turned it off and called it a wash. When the movie got going it sure got going! There was one point when I actually had to pause the movie and go have a cigarette. I just couldn't handle anymore! I ended up growing a pair and finishing the movie. Hands down the most terrifying movie I have ever seen.Side note: I watched it again with my gf and she pretty much laughed at it.

When I saw the movie for the first time, I have never seen any of his films before.It's an interesting story about a man who is living alone with his son, because his wife died when the son was just a little boy. Now after a couple of years, the father decided to marry again. To find the right woman for him, a friend of the father had a great idea. They start an audition, so that he can choose one the beautiful women. He falls in love, just when he sees the photograph of one of the girls. They meet a few times and it seems that he had chosen the right girl to marry.

Also like the other reviewer, I found it tough to get through the first hour, but it's worth seeing what happens even if you end up fast forwarding. As a horror/suspense film buff, not much will make me jump, so I don't remember there being a part that will freak anyone out. The best that I could describe this film is ""American Psycho"" in Japanese. Granted this movie was not as good as ""American Psycho,"" but it is a decent attempt. I thought it could have been a lot more like ""American Psycho,"" and not necessarily as violent or gory. Just the same amount of action. It just appeared that Asami would have been more psychotic or sociopathic given her childhood. Overall, a half decent attempt at a suspense/thriller, I wouldn't even categorize it as a horror.

Audition begins like some kind of a love story (i guess) with a little comedy ,and it keeps going for 1h and 20 minutes almost .bla.bla .bla ,a widower ,bla ,bla meets a woman through an audition ,bla ,bla ,bla ,she 's weird ,bla ,bla ,he s in love ...Then suddenly the movie cuts.The man has a stupid dream (or not ) and after another 10 minutes we see him on the floor and the woman cutting his legs and pinning needles into his stomach and eyes -yey! then his son comes home ,the man has another stupid dream (or not ) ,the woman sprays his son with something to which his son is obviously immune (very lame stuff) and his son kills the woman .the police will come and we made another movie ... People see this movie and think this is a good movie because people like movies that give twists and something to think about but Miike is just overdoing it .every movie the same stuff ,gore and a twist ...audition didn t even have much gore ...Audition didn t have much of anything .Takashi makes 10 films a year so there is nothing deep to find in a movie like this -but if you look deep enough you can see smth psychological in ""two stupid dogs "" also . love the genius who just looks to shock you and make you wonder about a movie which is about nothing .

This is a film best watched with no expectations and no preparation, so if you haven't seen it don't read on.Audition made by the veteran director Takashi Miike (known for 'do not show for kids' movies) came out with this shocking piece of cinema in Japan - it caused a few shouts from the censors landing it up the top with a R-18 certificate (the highest general rating in Japan) and an 18 in the UK as well.It starts like a well made romance - the first hour or so plays quite nicely and you may begin to relate to the interesting characters and may even support the fake audition plan to find Aoyama a new wife, especially when it leads him to a nice looking girl who is very responsive to his intentions.But as soon as the bag rolls over - things begin to get disturbing, first slowly with a guy getting pleasure over watching a girl dance, and torturing her when she refuses to dance, then culminating in a terrifying torture scene leading you on a really mind-squeezing experience. The psycho-horror ending makes the experience even worse, me and many others that I know have felt very uncomfortable after that film. It is really not one for kids.",Audition

The whole movie is quite normal, all the ""terror"" concentrates on the last 15 minutes or so where some obscene and sadistic scenes are shown, well but nothing that horrible to make the film worth watching. I think this might be a general problem for Europeans or Americans with Japanese horrors. If you watched the original Japanese horror ""Ring"" and you were disappointed, don't even think about watching Audition. It's but killing time.

I love this film but it scared me to my core. I think this film raises the bar in terms of horror and following on from Ringu, Dark Waters. I can only hope it is not remade by Hollywood as they failed miserably to remake The Ring and Ring 2.

358,jane-p,Not for the tender-hearted,6,30 October 2005,"The preview blurb in a national television listings magazine for the UK attracted me to a film I would not normally watch. It read like a come-on to experience something akin to reading Brett Easton-Ellis' American Pscyho - a no-no if you have a sensitive stomach and a need for that feel-good factor but essential viewing for film buffs.Audition was similar to American Psycho in it's resultant feelings of ""What is the message here?""; ""Yuk, that's one way of putting it"", and, ""I hope people are not so sick in real life"". It did nothing to enrich my understanding of man or women kind but rather left me feeling that someone had just made a slick sick statement on the eternal dilemma of relationships.Intellectual analysis or post-modern labelling doesn't relinquish this film from the fact it has nothing new to say. Sure, the softness of the real relationship and the savagery of the dreamt was masterfully presented. The titillation of BDSM contrasted with the bosom of the family was effective. The use of time lag and abruptness worked. Audition triumphs cinematically because of it's unexpected shock tactics.

Tasaki creates two main characters with different traits that are shown later on in the film; Shigeharu originally is cool and calculated but becomes extremely naive while Asami is at the end of the film is obsessive, demonic and sadistical; in sharp contrast to the painfully shy person she was believed to be. Tashaki's skill in suspense is clearly shown in the film. The film provides a warning on the effects that the traditional male dominating society in Japan can produce in a women; Japanese women can be much more strong and powerful than men and are unafraid to show it when they are enraged.",Audition
360,pdd-66863,"Don't bother, there are far better films to watch than this.",3,28 September 2020,"What an exceptionally dull film. Bring a book for something to do between the few good moments.When someone tells you a good joke if you're in the middle of something mind-numbingly boring it might barely raise a smile but if the same joke is told at another time when you're more receptive it can make you cry with laughter.This film is much like that - it had a few brief moments that had potential but because they appeared after so much boredom they lacked impact.The opening scene had potential to become truly heart-breaking - a young boy arrives at hospital just in time to find his mother has passed away moments before - but nothing more is made of it and we see the father and son walking away from the hospital as if nothing has happened.Maybe that's just a cultural thing but to me it seems clinical, cold. Son, your mother has died and that's that, hey ho let's go fishing.The majority of the rest of the film is the father being on his own, being at home with his son and housekeeper, going to work, talking about maybe holding a fake film audition to find himself a wife, actually holding the auditions where we get to sit through every painfully dull interviewee. We're a long way through the film before the antagonist finally arrives.Another sizeable chunk of the film is him going on dates with the woman he chose. Very little happens worthy of mention.There are a couple of brief scenes which show her to be very disturbed but by then I was so numbed by boredom that they skated over the surface of my mind and evaporated without leaving a trace.There was one scene where she keeps a mutilated man in a sack. I think she feeds him on her own regurgitated meals but the regurgitation (if that's what it was) happens off camera so the impact of that is lost. This should have been a great scene but it isn't.The final drugged torture sequence shows very little of the actual torture - we see acupuncture needles in the skin but not see them going in - and him getting his foot cut off with a wire saw is far too clean.I don't see how this film could be given 10/10 by some people. It has few redeeming features, is far too long, is exceptionally dull and because the finale occurs after so much boredom I no longer cared what happened, I just wanted it to end.I saw this on Netflix and the quality of the video and audio is appalling. The video looks like we were watching a camcorder recording from in a cinema and the audio track had a lot of intrusive white noise.

Normally watching more than one film would get me slightly bored but, this film really had me captivated throughout.Do yourself a favor and see it!

It builds the climax superbly and I want this climax as the director conceived it.Still, 10 out of 10. This movie is huge. It made me jump from my seat several times. It builds great tension and panic for what you fear that may come. I liked a lot the contorted and visually stunning way Miike tells the story and introduces the characters. Psychologically is very subtle. Maybe in the end this is what makes it work the most. I really understand if women hate it. I find it very misogynistic. I think women here are either irrelevant or completely dependent and desperate for men's love and respect and, incapable of achieving it, lead a resigned unhappy life or turn into sadistic monsters.

The director Miike ingeniously sets you up for a climactic and horrific ending . You'll be begging yourself to look away , but at the same time , compelled to watch as the last moments of the film unfold . The actress who plays Ayami is seductive and psychotic at the same time.

This movie shines a light on the pitfalls of misogyny and abuse enacted towards women in Japanese culture, represented by Asami.

376,bcarruth,Far less than the sum of its parts.,4,15 June 2007,"This film falls short as a horror masterpiece on both counts: it is neither a horror film nor a masterpiece. The individual components of the film sound good as bullet points, but never really gel into a cohesive whole. Each element of the film is well conceived but mishandled in the delivery.Audition proposes themes of middle-aged anxiety and accountability, sexual obsession, and the delicate interplay between desire and guilt. Sounds interesting? Again, on paper, this sounds like a promising movie, and had these themes been handled with even a hint of nuance, sense of pacing, or subtlety, that promise may have paid off.One can hardly call a movie subtle when one of the characters exists purely as a foreshadowing device. Our protagonists producer friend spends most of his time on-screen saying that he ""has a bad feeling"" about the femme fatale. The first of these comments is minutes after her character has been introduced. We never have an opportunity to build suspense regarding the ultimate nature of this woman, as the moment she is on screen we are bombarded with references to the ""mysterious disappearances"" of everyone even remotely connected to her.Once Mr. Foreshadowing has introduced us to Obvious Killer Girl, Hapless Romantic Protagonist launches into a brief courtship, peppered with further conversations with Mr. Foreshadowing, just in case we've forgotten the ""bad feeling"" he mentioned in a scene 10 minutes prior. From here we launch into a series of non-linear sequences that introduce characters out of thin air (HOW did he find Wheelchair Man? WHY is he living in a boarded up building?). While we may be expected to accept this haphazard montage as an exploration of the psyche, the imagery lacks any emotional coherence, and lacks the raw elemental force necessary to instill a reaction in such short cuts.What we seem to have in Audition is a filmmaker influenced by far more skillful filmmakers. We can see notes borrowed from Lynch, early Kubrick, or Tvorsky, but without the subtle touch and careful pacing necessary to pull it off. Psychological tension is exactly like comedy in its reliance on timing. The timing in Audition is too abrupt, the introduction of scene too arbitrary, and the underlying themes too underdeveloped to be effective.The much heralded last half hour is, by most standards, quite tame. The visceral quality of the scene is blunted by disjointed cinematography (though not ""jagged"" enough to produce a reaction of its own). The scene becomes laughable in its first lines: men are all after sex, so I'm going to hurt you. We then move into ""pain makes us honest"", delivered in phrasing one expects to hear prior to getting their tongue pierced. Graphic violence with the proper psychological context and presentation can be very effective, even outside the horror genre (Cronenburg's ""History of Violence"" comes to mind). Here we have no real context, and the overuse of ominous reference and gross-out imagery earlier in the film further dilute our reaction.If you want an exploration of the destructive action of lust and the interplay between desire and guilt, watch Blue Velvet. If you want psychological horror with a hefty splatter factor, watch Saw. If you want a decent Asian horror flick that does NOT center around long-haired girls crawling out of things, watch Cello. For any of these three categories there are countless alternatives, and almost all of them manage to deliver their punch better than Audition.",Audition
377,noodleboyo,A horror epiphany.,10,29 December 2002,"This is a very special movie for me. Why? Well, for the last five or so years I've been searching for a horror movie that actually scared/shocked me. Having seen nigh on everything I could get my hands on, I finally managed to rent Audition over Christmas after wanting to see it for, well, ages.This movie is about as genre busting as they come. Ever seen a horror film where the first two thirds are a romantic comedy? This is what audition does, and herein lies the genius. Through the rom/com parts of the auditions and datings I actually generated a certian empathy for the characters. Takashi directs this part of the film with a wit, because he knows what's coming. There's a cheesily comic montage, and the direction is, frankly, bog standard.Why would a capable director do that? It lulls the viewer into a false sense of security, and the well crafted script ensures sympathy and identification with Aoyama. Then the film just plunges neckfirst into a nightmare, and Takashi's direction zooms into this colour soaked, extraodinarily stylised horror. The effect it had on me was something else... I'd never seen such a strong contrast in style and story - a thoroughly extreme cinematic device that just threw me completely.Then come the final scenes. Well, you can read all you like about them and - like me - go 'Cool! Cheesewires! Excellent!' but frankly, that's the most unbearable sequence I've ever seen comitted to film. After watching the, er, foot part through my fingers, the sound was the thing that really struck me. Like scraping a wire brush down a blackboard. That and 'Kiri, kiri, kiri' will probably stay with me for the rest of my days.Looking at some of the other reviews, there seems to be some confusion about the ending or the moral. I see the film as a feminist statement, a big 'f*ck you!' to Japan's ingrained sexism. But anyway, this film is undeniable proof that Japan does horror so much inventively and plain *better* than the states.",Audition

The ratings for this blown out of proportion for they are based on the memorable last 15 mins. The majority of the movie is boring if you came with a mindset to watch a horror flick, which is what a preview of the movie led me to believe. So I sit down to watch what I think will be a good horror movie only to be left crestfallen as I keep waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the horror. I almost turned off the movie twice. Had I gone into this film with the info/mindset that this a psychological drama with good build up to scant intense scenes in the end, I would have come out with a better reception of the film. Booo to those previews, summaries, and TV shows that rate this as a great horror flick. I think I even saw this film in a top 10 for horror films. If this whole movie was the way the last 15 mins was, then yes, this portrayal would be valid.",Audition
379,frenchgod,Slow and steady into madness *SPOILERS*,10,1 April 2020,"Damn. So I have always seen this movie on top of many people's top horror list. I knew it was going to be good...I had no idea how unsettling it was going to be. It took a while to get going but it works perfectly. That first shot when she's just awake in bed for 1 sec... like she can feel or sense that he is reading/thinking about her. The creepiest scene in my humble opinion, is when she is all hunched over like some insect, starring at the phone, waiting or even controlling him to make the call. That shot of her spine! I feel like it's going to burst out of her neck! (Which it does). Followed by that horrific smile when the phone rings and how long she waits till she answers... She knows she has him... amazing. The mysterious tortured soul in the potato bag is incredibly horrible. At first it sounds like a pig or boar... but you know. Just great, can't believe I waited this long to watch it.",Audition
380,redrogue,possible spoiler..but not too detailed,6,29 October 2002,"As much as I enjoyed this film, I did not find it to be 'The most shocking film of the year' as the theater that I went to see this film advertised. In a full house of people there were about 5-10 people who actually laughed at was supposed to be the 'shocking' parts of the film. Maybe I have been jaded by watching slasher films in the past, but I would not put this movie in that category. Watch it, but its a rental in my opinion and not a night at 'The Art House Theater' of your choice.",Audition
381,Formidible,moments of pure revulsion,6,14 January 2003,"There is something so twisted about the finale of this film that left me wanting to hurl for hours and even thinking about it now makes me queazy. Much of it is good, but when it gets demented it goes all out and managed to disturb me big time.  I admit, I am weak stomached, but if you're into gore, it's probably great.",Audition
382,Penguin_Of_Doom,Really quite pointless,3,12 July 2010,"A story contains 3 parts: a beginning, a middle and an end. Without all 3 of these aspects a story cannot exist. Audition does not contain an end, and thus contains no storyline.The movie is, to put it tamely, abstract. My friend recommended me this film building it up as if it were the greatest film ever created, and by the end of the movie both of us were left sorely disappointed.My theory is that the film was running on a deadline, and they were far enough behind schedule that it became more and more rushed and when they didn't have the time to devise a proper ending, figured they'd make more money if they left it so unfinished that people could dream up whatever conclusions they felt would make them feel like they'd had 2 well spent hours.The film is in two acts, so to speak, that are drastically different, The second beginning when he wakes up around 1 hour in. The first act is noticeably better, because it builds itself up to have great storyline potential and the cinematography is at least intriguing. The second act has much less insight put into the cinematographic aspects, such as shot placement, that are so key to forming the mood in the first act. The gore thrown into the latter half has no conceivable purpose. The body in the bag that is seen throughout the movie is asinine and pointless. It is just one of many unused opportunities to create a proper story, but is left in the dumpster as it just adds to the shock quality a little more.The one saving grace that this film has is the fantastic acting by the woman who portrays Asami, who has to act convincingly as multiple personalities, and successfully does so.",Audition
383,ben-roshong,Bad movie,1,31 October 2010,"Honestly, I couldn't stand this movie. I have seen my fair share of bad horror films and this one really tops the list as the worst film I have ever seen. The plot build-up was too long and frankly I was getting bored to death with how long the movie was taking. Not once during this film did I find myself remotely afraid or freaked out. Everything was plain and boring. I do not understand how so many people enjoyed this movie. Its awful. I do not suggest that anyone else watch this movie. The only thing horrific about it is how stupid it really is. It made no sense at all. I am even more shocked about how some people were scared of the bag. Why? Its just a bag, that moves a couple times in the movie. We all know what is in it. So do we really need to be that afraid. I will never watch this movie again, and I highly recommend that no one else watch it either.",Audition
384,rainbowsparkle1,"The most messed up movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait to see it again!",9,11 July 2006,"I recently watched a Bravo special talking about the 100 scariest movies. Well, 'Audition' should have been #1 no contest. This Japanese horror flick begins with a lonely man who works for a talent agency. He lives with his son, who is always trying to get him date other woman. So, finally, he decides to hold a fake audition for the next beg movie starlet. Many girls come in and audition, but one girl really catches his eye. Her name is Asami. He calls her and they go out on a couple dates, but nothing seems to be moving along. This takes up the first hour and twenty minutes, and I did everything I could to stop myself from giving up on it. Finally, we start to see something that's not quite right. Asami, sitting on the floor, hunched over, staring at the phone. In the background, there is a huge bag. When the phone starts ringing, she looks up, smiling. And then the bag jumps. And makes a lot of really awful sounds. Asami breaks into the man's house and drugs him. He falls into an incomprehensible stupor and wakes up in Asami's apartment. Once again, the big bag from the phone scene starts moving. He opens it, and surprise! It's a man, with two fingers on his right hand, one ear, no tongue, and no feet. He crawls out moaning and we hear gurgling in the background, which we pay not a whole lot of attention to. In walks Asami, holding an overflowing dog dish filled with vomit. She sets in front of the man, who begins devouring it. All this time, the talent agent is leaning against a wall, with the most horrifying expression on his face. Again he passes out and comes to in his own house. Asami tells him that, though the drug she has given him has left him immobile, he will be able to feel the pain. She begins her torture with acupuncture needles, and it makes it all the more sickening that she sterilizes him before she begins her work. Luckily for the main guy and for us, she only manages to amputate one foot, before the son walks in and stops her. Though the translation is bad (The talent agent asks his secretary at one point ""What is it?"" to which she replies ""Not really"") and the stuff that you rented the damn movie to see doesn't start until the movie is 4/5s of the way over, it's by far the sickest, most twisted movie I have ever seen, and I loved it!",Audition
385,exite11,Gushing with style beauty and a brisk delivery of horror,9,3 October 2004,"The plot line revolves around a successful producer and widower who is convinced by his son and co-worker to start dating again and find the perfect woman. A phony audition for ""Tomorrow's Heroine"" is held and, Aoyama our protagonist takes interest in much younger woman who reminds him of his deceased wife.The pace is Slow, so to have viewers constantly err as to what is going to happen as well as to administer a very Adult, cold brilliantly horrific film. This is not fatal attraction, just like The beach boys weren't The Doors. Children or fans of formulated date-movies (or formulated ""date-thrillers"") should skip this; but know that the Skill of the director is what drive these scenes home not Hollywood commercial bloodfest. However if you wonder what type of movie Alfred Hitchcock would have dlighted us with in the year 2000, please rent/buy this. The film is directed beautifully and the acting really makes you take a look at the ""pop"" state Hollywood is in. Purely excellent, close minded people don't deserve this attention to detail.",Audition
386,traveljr,Three simple words caused this? *spoiler*,10,5 October 2006,"This movie really freaked me out. I will never tell a woman I love you if I know I don't mean it. Especially a psychologically unstable woman like her. The really down side to this man is, if he knows all about this woman's past and all the hardships she has had, why wouldn't he see that she has to have some form of expression for her anger? While watching this movie, I couldn't help but see the connection between ""Audition"" and ""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"". Because Lynn Whitfields character was just as crazy and Psycotic as this woman. But, what I really like about this movie is the way that they passed her off as being a sweet and pure but really she has a very dark side.Botom Line, If any American directors are thinking about remaking this wonderful Japanese horror movie... Don't!!! Nothing can pass the original ""Audition"".~traveljr",Audition
387,saltdean,Memorable,7,31 January 2005,"I watched this film on a Sunday afternoon with a fire roaring away and a bottle of wine at the ready with a cosy afternoon planned. I was enthralled by the cinematography as much as anything else. Some of the shots were framed beautifully - like works of art. The acting was low key initially and rarely for a film like this (is there another film like this?) the victim was portrayed with a lot of affection, giving us time to learn about his lonely life and his warm relationship with his son. The first time we see the interior of the audition winners flat I had to blink to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing. I have just recommended this film to a friend who knows absolutely nothing about it. I think this would have been a great way to see the film. With that in mind I will stop whithering and just say that if you haven't seen this movie, check it out - and look out for some of the beautiful images amidst the more challenging ones. If you plan a cosy Sunday I would recommend getting a different movie. If you want a film that will make you sit up and take notice then this will certainly fill that criteria - and some.",Audition
388,yves-blindeman,Great piece of art,10,8 June 2005,"About ten times I have replayed the film now. It never stops amazing me. A girl, her mentor, her talent for ballet, that's all it takes. It doesn't take a genius to find out the girl is not only very pretty, but also very pretty twisted and insane. You've seen the cover, you could have guessed. And although the film starts off very slow, it soon gets crystal clear that she's not what she appears to be. Bit by bit you get dragged into the darkside of this girls strange view on life. Bit by bit you realize that love at first sight is a dangerous thing to play with. You want to believe that it is all a misunderstanding. Really, she can't be all that bad, she's a sweet, very sweet young lady. Don't get your hopes up. Deep inside you already know that this code can't be cracked anymore. It takes tons of dynamite break her lock. In ""the grand finale"" she proves what you already knew. She's evil... of the purest form. So pure that it's almost a shame to let it end. Torture comes in two shapes: the crime and the form of art. In audition it is without a doubt a form of art. Entered my top 10 of all-time favorite movies. Right up there with Hitchcock!",Audition

390,d_random,Disappointed,3,1 November 2006,"This film deals a serious blow to the Japanese horror genre. Suspense, thrills of any sort of redeeming qualities are all missing. Basically the first 90 minutes is a laborious budding romance story between a fake producer and a wanna-be actress. If this movie were not labeled a horror you would have no idea for the first 3/4 of the film. Absolutely nothing unusual happens to lead you to believe that the actress is deranged besides a warning from the producer's pal. In the last 20 minutes when all the actions happens it is without any sort of believable motivation. And the last scene payoff, not to sound detached, is far lacking for the time invested. 3 out of 10.",Audition
391,tinram2005,New Asian cinema,10,2 October 2005,"I grew up thinking Naruse,Ozu and Mizoguchi were the last word in Japanese cinema growing up in Los Angeles its easy to find Indian , HongKong even now Iranian film . Now stuck in South Florida I miss 90%of what is made overseas . We only get light fare from always France never Germany or Spain or the rest of Europe. But I read what I can in the film journals. Anyway , if you love rich thoughtful cinematography ,lighting, and camera work that vivifies a story as much as each character and locale ,then Audition as the masterful work of all its makers will please you . I only wish I could see it on a large screen witha terrified grossed out audience. what surprises.I cant wait to get Visitor Q and Ichi the Killer. I love Young Thugs #1(Now we must get #2),I love the way he and his screenwriter(I didn't check to c if Miike wrote this one )for me its evocation of childhood the agonies and delights was as touching as Truffaut 400 Blows.Also Missed Call not as painstakingly produced. Good to look at but nowhere the painterly compositions of AUDITION . So glad I didn't buy it.Its good .Well made but so typical of that genre I felt I was watching movie Id seen in the U.s. already a million times. I 'd recommend A TaleOf Two Sisters. I loved it ! Beautiful to look at ,slow engrossing interior rhythms matched with sometimes quick camera movement in the first movement of the film . Also here mature filmmakers letting thing s go at their own pace. The house itself says a lot with all of its squares inside squares a common metaphor in film that helps us feel the odd fallibility of a faulty narrative. I can look at this film over and over but the story is infuriating one of those Henry Jamesian can we trust the narrator dealsNow if I can just find some more gore that looks good .That doesn't really make sense . I think Miike would be the man to remake Bergman's CRIES and Whispers .He seems to identify not only with his murdering henchman but strong self willed woman. Oh ,also the hype behind Ju-on and Ringu I have already forgotten those films .See OldBoy, I love this film . HongKong director don't remember name. I love this film with its overt homage to Teshigahara's Women in The Dunes .Wong Kar Wai is on my list as well as the maker of IN A Mood for Love. AChingly beautiful.",Audition
392,wezzymay,Wow!!!!!,5,16 September 2005,"Though the movie had a horrific ending and still left me hanging not knowing if this is real or the guilt and shame of an old man dreaming his way out of a bad situation. The movie was to long, needed more horror and gore in the beginning. I believe a horror movie should keep you at the edge of your sit from beginning to end. The lead up to the last fifteen minutes was the only part I enjoyed. As a horror movie buff the Japanese version of horror movie takes to long to get to the real reason for the movie. I would not tell my friends to waste their time in seeing this movie; for I could give them the plot and ending in less then ten seconds.",Audition
393,keenerb,Waste of time,1,2 February 2006,"An hour and a half of mediocre story, followed by ten minutes of cookie-cutter ending.There's virtually no identifiable character development, the plot struggles to rise above mediocrity. The acting greatly outclasses both the story and the directing, and is the only thing that keeps a movie that could (and should!) have been told in a 15 minute independent film from becoming tedious and unwatchable.In the movie's defense, I can see how it might appeal to people who liked, perhaps, ""Raye makhfi"" or similar movies, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, especially after having read many rave reviews of this ""horror movie."" Unfortunately, it tries to be too many things to too many people, and ultimately fails at them all.",Audition

This is probably one of the scariest movie I have ever seen due to the level of psychotic thinking behind the plot. Typical ""horror movies"" made in the US are nothing compared to this movie: like comparing hopscotch to football as contact sports. If you have seen and liked the other films Takashi Miike has done or you think you're ready for something more intense than you are used to, this is a must see movie. The fact that it is in Japanese with English subtitles only enhances the experience, and your spine will tingle every time you hear the words, ""kiri kiri kiri kiri."" The casting was excellent, and so was the acting. I have not read the book this is based off, but it felt like all of the characters were being portrayed the way they were supposed to be. Again, while I recommend this movie heavily, I will probably never want to see it a second time.",Audition

This soft Japanese voice repeating this high-pitched syllable over and over with intermittent static on the screen.I had to put on food network to finish my dinner... I really thought I was in for a spooky movie!! NOPE!! The first 90 minutes were the utter snooze!! The final 30 comprised scenes that cut and jumped around which made no sense... Too many unanswered questions in this movie... Then a supposedly ""gruesome"" torture scene... What was gruesome about it? They didn't show the needles going into the eye .. They barely showed the dismemberment ... most of it was off screen. In fact instead of getting grossed out, I was getting turned on by this cute Asian girl in a short white skirt and knee-high boots... I almost whipped it out and well ... *ahem* ...Then in the middle of this cheap torture scene ... it jumps back to another scene in the movie ... This made no sense ... No sooner though, are we back at the torture scene again.. Now I was getting dizzy...How dare a movie put me to sleep for 90 minutes, then confuse me ... I feel like a victim!",Audition
