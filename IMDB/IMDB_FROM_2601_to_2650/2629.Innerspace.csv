0,Leofwine_draca,A great piece of family entertainment,8,10 November 2011,"One of those quintessential family movies of the 1980s, INNERSPACE turns out not to have dated a bit since it was first release. The story, which is heavily indebted to the '60s movie FANTASTIC VOYAGE, sees Dennis Quaid shrunk down to miniature size and injected into the body of super-nerd Martin Short. What follows plays out as a live action cartoon, which is no surprise with Joe Dante at the helm. Dante is one of those directors who doesn't know how to make an unappealing movie, and INNERSPACE is one of his most entertaining efforts.I've never been a huge fan of Dennis Quaid, and his performance here is hardly endearing: he plays a rude, arrogant, loud-mouthed drunk for much of the film, and casting Meg Ryan as his insipid girlfriend isn't much help either. Still, I do like Martin Short, and his turn here is rather endearing and genuinely funny, especially when infused with the clumsy slapstick style of humour. Dante has a great eye for a supporting cast, fleshing out roles for the likes of old-timer Kevin McCarthy (a ball as the bad guy), Vernon Wells as the hit-man, Fiona Lewis, Robert Picardo as an unlikely cowboy and, of course, Dick Miller.The script is light and airy and never lets itself get bogged down in science. The journeys inside the body are excellent and have all the imagination of an outer space classic. Finally, we get Rob Bottin contributing some literally jaw-dropping FX work, which rounds out the package nicely. The 1980s may well have been the decade that taste forgot, but they sure knew how to make a fun movie back then.",Innerspace
1,SnoopyStyle,Martin Short wacky good but movie a little uneven,6,10 April 2015,"Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is a cocky military pilot bitter at being past over. His reporter girlfriend Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan) can't take it anymore and moves out. Tuck is crazy enough to take part in a miniaturization experiment. The process works but the lab is attacked. Lab worker Ozzie manages to take the syringe containing Tuck and inject it into hypochondriac Jack Putter (Martin Short) before Ozzie is killed by a henchman. Tuck connects to Jack but Jack thinks he's going crazy. Then the bad guys track down Jack. When they get back to the lab, they find out that the other computer chip needed to re-enlarge Tuck has been stolen. They set off to steal back the chip with Lydia's help.It's a wacky sci-fi comedy. Martin Short is doing his body bending best. He has a few good funny moments. Some of it is trying too hard to be wacky. It's strange that this is a high intensity thriller at one moment and a silly camp B-movie the next. Dennis Quaid is disadvantaged by being stuck by himself for most of the movie. There are good moments but it's a little uneven.",Innerspace
2,gavin6942,A Thrilling Action-Comedy of Tiny Proportions!,7,25 September 2006,"Caveat: I have always hated Martin Short. I find him annoying, semi-retarded, and blame him for the Phoebe-Cates-career-killing ""Drop Dead Fred"", even if he was not even in that film. However, Short was quite amusing in this one.""Innerspace"" has Dennis Quaid shrunk down to be injected into a rabbit. Whoops! He's stolen by the villain from ""UHF"" and injected into Martin Short instead, who then must save Quaid with the help of Quaid's girlfriend, the pseudo-lesbian Meg Ryan.Short's quirkiness worked for this film. I mean, goodness, he has a little man inside of him. And he works well with director Joe Dante, a Steven Spielberg protégé influenced by Bugs Bunny... his comedy is best reflected in ""Gremlins"" and ""Gremlins 2"". How he got to be a master of horror is beyond me (though one would assume from ""The Howling"").The shots inside the body were interesting (like the ""Body Wars"" ride at Disney World), and Quaid was a great pilot for the adventure. I could have used less Meg Ryan, who seemed to be very unnecessary to the plot and her allegiance was unclear.So um, yeah... it was a fun romp... watch it.",Innerspace
3,lee_eisenberg,Don't shrink this movie's prominence.,10,18 October 2005,"Joe Dante may be the zaniest director out there, along with Tim Burton. ""Matinee"" is my favorite of his movies, but ""Innerspace"" is certainly also up there. For the for couple of minutes, I couldn't figure out what was going on, but suddenly, the plot became clear. Lt. Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is shrunk down to the size of a dust speck to be injected into an animal - a la ""Fantastic Voyage"". But then, a terrorist group seizes the lab and one of the scientists carries the hypodermic out. With his last bit of strength, he injects Tuck into local dweeb Jack Putter (Martin Short) - without informing Jack of this. From there, some very embarrassing predicaments arise for the two men, not the least of which is how to explain the situation to explain to Tuck's hubby Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan).Throughout, ""Innerspace"" has Dante's quirky mark all over it. Dante of course gives a role to Dick Miller: in this case, Miller plays a cab driver. Dante regulars Kevin McCarthy and Robert Picardo also star, the former as villain Victor Scrimshaw, the latter as Scrimshaw's associate Cowboy. With some crazy lines, this movie is pure fun for everyone.",Innerspace
4,jboothmillard,Innerspace,6,15 January 2007,"This is obviously the film where cartoon Futurama got the inspiration to create an episode about going into the human body. Basically Lt. Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is the man with a huge mission to take part in the scientific experiment of miniaturisation, but the bad news is that some bad guys catch up with the man with Tuck in the syringe, and this guy injects Jack Putter (Martin Short) instead of the intended dog. Now with the help of Tuck's miniaturised ship, he has communicate with Jack to both find the bad guys, and get him back to normal size before his air supply runs out. From the director of Gremlins and Small Soldiers, this is quite an interesting blend of biological science fiction with comedy. Also starring Meg Ryan as Lydia Maxwell, Kevin McCarthy as Victor Eugene Scrimshaw and Fiona Lewis as Dr. Margaret Canker. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Good!",Innerspace
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Silly, But Not A Kids' Film",7,9 October 2006,"This is an updated ""Fantastic Voyage"" and interestingly done, I thought. Joe Dante directed a number of fun movies to watch.It's not the innocent Steven Spielberg ""E.T.""-like movie I expected because of the language and several sex jokes. In other words, this is not a kids' movie.Dennis Quaid stars and plays his usual cocky self. (He's mellowed in recent years.) Meg Ryan is her usual cute-but-of-little-substance self and Martin Short is just plain funny - the best guy in the movie.The film offers a good combination of humor and science-fiction suspense. It's a fun movie I would rate higher if it weren't so silly in spots.",Innerspace
6,rmax304823,Mission Infeasible.,5,29 January 2012,"Concept has plenty of potential. Cocky young Navy lieutenant Dennis Quaid is to be miniaturized in a kind of innerspace pod and injected into a laboratory rabbit named Bug where, in visual and audio contact with the lab personnel in Silicon Valley, he will explore the leporine internal milieu.The two tiny computer chips that make miniaturization and later restoration possible are extremely valuable, so bad guys stage a raid on the lab. The hypodermic syringe with the miniature pod is rushed out of the lab and injected by accident into the Assistant Manager of a local Safeway, Martin Short, who is a hypochondriac and a coward. The bad guys quickly identify Short and are in pursuit of him and the puzzled Quaid.Quaid is right for the part, and so is Martin Short whose features are goofy but not unpleasant. Quaid establishes contact with the terrified short and together they sweep up Quaid's girl friend, Meg Ryan, into the chase, which constitutes the entirety of the plot. Boy, she's cute. Two of Short's colleagues from SCTV show up -- Joe Flaherty and Andrea Martin. The bad guy is Kevin McCarthy, star of the science-fiction classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" and a bit part in a men's room is given to Kenneth Toby, the Air Force Captain from ""The Thing From Another World."" Alas, the movie, having established the tenets of the comic adventure, runs out of steam almost at once and becomes a frenzied succession of shouts, gun shots, car chases, delirious antics, and ridiculous fights. At least it can be said that it spare us much sentiment. I only winced once, when Quaid accidentally is transferred to the inside of his girl friend and discovers she's pregnant, and there is romantic music as Quaid's eyes light up and he mutters to himself, ""I'm a Dad,"" and the viewer pendiculates.There are some fine comedies that came out around the same time -- ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" ""The Freshman,"" ""Analyze This"" -- but this doesn't belong in the same category. This one substitutes speed for wit. All the attention seems to have been lavished on special effects and action, while the dialog and any humor associated with character has been ignored.The kids might enjoy it more than the adults.",Innerspace
7,Tweekums,An enjoyable sci-fi caper,7,18 May 2017,"Former US Navy pilot Lt. Tuck Pendleton is taking part in a ground breaking experiment. If all went according to plan he would get onto a pod that will be miniaturised to an almost microscopic size then injected into a rabbit it does not go according to plan. A rival firm wants the technology and breaks into the lab just after the pod has been miniaturised and placed in a hypodermic syringe; they steal one of the chips required to return the pod to its correct size while a technician flees with the needle. He is chased down but before he is caught he injects it into hapless Jack Putter; a hypochondriac. Tuck pilots the pod through Jack and after connecting sensors to his optic nerve and ear can see what Jack sees and communicate with him. Once it becomes apparent to him what happened he must find a way to retrieve the chip before his air runs out. There is also the problem that the villains want to find him as the re-enlarging process needs the chip they stole and one in the pod; without this the technology would be of limited value.This film provides a fun blend of science fiction, comedy and action. The concept is fairly silly but that doesn't matter because it never takes itself too seriously. There are plenty of laughs from start to finish, and a decent amount of family friendly action. Dennis Quaid does a fine job as Lt Pendleton even though he spends most of the time just sat in his pod talking to Jack. Martin Short is a lot of fun as Jack; a character that develops nicely through the film from a rather wimpy hypochondriac to a far more self-assured man. Meg Ryan is likable as Tuck's girlfriend, who gets drawn into the adventure; the rest of the cast are pretty good too. The special effects for Tuck's journey through Jack's body are impressive and there are also some good stunts. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting so good family friendly action; there are one or two mildly crude jokes but I suspect they would go over the heads of younger viewers.",Innerspace

9,hitchcockthelegend,Eat Me - Drink Me,8,26 May 2019,"Innerspace is directed by Joe Dante and written by Jeffrey Boam and Chip Proser. It stars Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, Meg Ryan and Kevin McCarthy. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Andrew Laszlo.A hapless hypochondriac store clerk battles to save the life of the man who, miniaturized in a secret experiment, was accidentally injected into him.The premise is of course absurd, but everyone involved knows this and proceed to entertain with a mixture of thrills, spills and a good old fashioned good versus bad value. Narrative is based around the race against time thematic as miniaturised Tuck Pendleton (Quaid) fights from within the body of Jack Putter (Short). He has to keep Jack out the hands of crooks who are after the secrets of the miniaturisation process, whilst simultaneously being on a clock before he runs out of air - or fall prey to Jack's anti-bodies system etc.Dante strings together some terrific set pieces, while the realisation of the inside of the human body is smartly staged. Cast are on hugely engaging form, with the central relationship between Quaid and Short a pure joy and mined for constant laugh and peril tactics. The dual aspect is niftily handled by Dante and his crew, with the battle within Jack's body running concurrently with Jack's battles out in the real world.What wonderful sci-fi froth this is, as Dante has a blast of a time with the effects tools to hand to take the concept of Fantastic Voyage and make a top line action comedy adventure. Great soundtrack too! 8/10",Innerspace
10,LeonLouisRicci,"Mediocre ""Joe Dante"" Movie...Seems to Struggle for the Right Tone...Overrated",6,26 September 2017,"Director Joe Dante made many Films a lot Better than this. ""The Howling"" (1981), ""Gremlins"" (1984), """"Matinee"" (1993), and, ""Small Soldiers"" (1998), just to mention a Few.This ""Spielberg"" Production has got Money Behind it and on the Surface it is Slick.

Although it did Take Home the Oscar.The 1966 Film ""Fantastic Voyage"" that this one Spoofs has SFX that, Believe it or Not, Top this one, 20 Years Later.The Stuff and Nonsense Outside the Body is Broad Slapstick and Surprisingly Lacking Insight and Wit from the Usually Funny Director and the Movie Feels like it is Struggling at times..

11,utgard14,If you can tolerate Dennis Quaid's faults you will enjoy this one,7,29 January 2014,"Joe Dante reworks Fantastic Voyage into a buddy comedy for Dennis Quaid and Martin Short. Quaid plays a cocky fighter pilot who is chosen to take part in an experiment where he will have to test a miniaturized craft. While inside the machine Quaid is shrunk down to microscopic size. But some bad guys try to hijack the experiment and Quaid winds up injected into the body of a hypochondriac grocery store clerk played by Martin Short. From there, hijinks ensue.Quaid is annoying, as he almost always was and is. His Joker smile and constant mugging grates on the nerves in the early scenes. He's better when things settle down some. Martin Short is the best part of the cast. Very funny and likable. Always love seeing a pretty young Meg Ryan. Although it reminds me of what she's done to herself since, which is tragic. Kind of the same feeling I get when watching young Melanie Griffith. This is a fun movie. Joe Dante gets to play with special effects and comedy, which is right in his wheelhouse. It's not as interesting or innovative as Fantastic Voyage but it's a very enjoyable movie in its own right.",Innerspace
12,Boba_Fett1138,Simply very good entertainment.,7,5 February 2005,"This movie offers perfect entertainment.The main characters and the performances by the actors are very good and comical. The movie is filled with some crazy 'not-so-everyday' characters and the villains are deliciously stereotyped and highly entertaining and there are some simply hilarious moments throughout the movie.The movie can be described as an adventure science-fiction comedy. Surely the movie will not be remembered as one of the best of all time but I will always remember this movie as a very entertaining one and of which I have some very fond childhood memories.The nice 'unknown' musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is very good, I actually watched this movie in honor of his death the day he had died, on 21 July 2004.As long as you don't expect a masterpiece and merely want to be entertained, this movie is perfectly recommendable. Also very watchable for the entire family.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Innerspace
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Funny early in the movie, then slopes downward in hilarity factor",6,30 July 2004,"I don't know; maybe I'm just not into Joe Dante's style(I didn't care too much for Small Soldiers and Gremlins 2 either), but I just didn't like this movie very much. In the beginning, I couldn't get into the movie at all; it seemed like we were supposed to care about this drunken lazy jerk who treats everyone else like garbage, and accept him as some sort of hero; I just didn't buy that. I hated Dennis Quaid's character from the very beginning, honestly. Then we were introduced to Martin Short's character, who was mildly redeeming in terms of quality, and I more or less got into his character. I can't say I really payed very much attention to the film, it really didn't grab my attention. The only thing I really liked was Martin Short's character, and the only really funny bit was about 45 minutes or so into the movie, when Martin first discovers what's happened with Dennis. That was a couple of scenes I did enjoy, but after that it stopped being funny. Save for the scene in the bathroom of the restaurant/cafe a little further into the film, I didn't laugh at all. The ""inside-body"" camera shots were disgusting at times, and seemed to be there mainly for that purpose(I mean, honestly, Dante could have done that some other way), but maybe that's just me. Most of the characters weren't likable, and far too many of them I flat-out hated, including two of the good guys(Quaid and Ryan). The humor was lame, apart from the examples I mentioned earlier, and just fails to inspire any laughter at all. The film just didn't really have anything going for it, apart from the humor, and there's way too little of that in the film. The special effects were very well-done, though, for such an old movie, and the acting was also quite good. All in all, decent enough, just too little good humor and too much forced humor. I recommend this only to fans of Joe Dante's other work. Surely they'll enjoy it(not to say that no one else will, but they'll enjoy it more than most others, I think). 6/10",Innerspace
14,view_and_review,Nanotechnology,8,18 September 2019,"Innerspace, which is such a cool play on words, was excellent.In typical Silicon Valley style a Bay Area tech company developed miniaturization. Truly, it is early nanotechnology in which they shrink normal sized machinery to nanometer size in order to inject into a live host. The uses are innumerous, including being used as a weapon.Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) was the test pilot for this new technology. He was supposed to be injected into a rabbit in a lab. What really ended up happening was that he was injected into a total stranger in a mall-- Jack Putter (Martin Short). There was one hilarious moment after the other as Jack thought he was going crazy all the while he had to elude some nefarious characters that wanted the technology that was inside of him.It was a brilliant movie that blended sci-fi with comedy; two genres I love when done right.",Innerspace
15,evanston_dad,Dennis Quaid Goes on a Fantastic Voyage,6,23 June 2008,"An enjoyable enough sci-fi comedy in which Dennis Quaid plays a scientist who's miniaturized and launched into the body of Martin Short. Think of it as a goofy, screwball version of ""Fantastic Voyage"".In comedy style, it's actually somewhat reminiscent of the Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin vehicle ""All of Me"", in that Quaid is able to influence Short's physical movements. As you can imagine, this results in all manner of physical comedy antics, but if you're going to go that route, you could do worse than placing the proceedings in the hands of Martin Short, a gifted physical actor.The special effects were quite nifty for the time, and won the film an Oscar.Grade: B",Innerspace
16,AaronCapenBanner,Overlong & Too Silly.,5,31 August 2013,"Science Fiction comedy from director Joe Dante about an experimental craft accidentally injected into grocery clerk Martin Short, and the various government factions that desperately try to recover it, while the pilot(played by Dennis Quaid) tries to contact Short, and convince him that he isn't just hearing voices. Meg Ryan plays the girlfriend, who tries to help them both.Some good model F/X and a fine cast cannot save this silly and contrived film that goes on far too long; being clearly inspired by ""Fantastic Voyage"", film has a great deal of action and imagination, but doesn't know when to quit.",Innerspace
17,Aaron1375,"Part action, part comedy and science fiction too.",8,10 December 2009,"This movie has a lot of elements to it and it strangely worked for me. I do not think it was a super success at the box office, but for me the movie was a very funny film. I do feel this one is more of a comedy than action or science fiction as Martin Short steals the show as the guy who ends up getting Dennis Quaid's character shot into his buttocks. The story, a group of scientist have invented a shrinking ray and they have used it to shrink Quaid's character and a ship to super small size. They aim to inject the ship and Quaid into a bunny, but some sort of attack occurs and he ends up injected into Short's character instead. So the rest of the film is the group that attacked the scientist coming after Short while Quaid tries to figure out a way to get big again. There are some interesting scenes of the insides of Short, though one has to wonder why they would have a device to attach to the inner ear of the bunny as I do not think you can talk to a bunny. The eye part though makes sense though. Another thing that makes little sense is the dude with the hand attachments, seems like a character that should be in a James Bond movie or something. I know there was a character exactly like that in a movie that was sort of a Get Smart movie called ""The Nude Bomb"" or something to that extent. This film though for the most part worked, especially when it was being a comedy.",Innerspace
18,SimonJack,Fairly good comedy and sci-fi spoof,7,6 September 2018,"""Innerspace"" is a fun comedy and sci-fi film, with a good cast. The plot isn't the first to deal with miniaturizing people, but this one has the dressing of lots of scientific know-how. It's also clearly a spoof of sci-fi, or this type of film at least. That's evident in the scenes of the lab with all the advanced scientific equipment. The place is a mess, papers are lying and flying all over the place, people spill drinks, etc. The cast does a good job. Dennis Quaid's Lt. Tuck Pendleton is overly crass. He's a boozer, womanizer, belligerent, and egotist. Martin Short's Jack Putter is very good, mixing his mental instability with comedy, heroics, and intelligence. Meg Ryan's Lydia Maxwell is okay. Fiona Lewis is a sex-crazed Dr. Margaret Canker. Perhaps there is symbolism in some the names. She could be a canker sore. Tuck and Putter and some other names (Igoe and Wormwood) can tweak the imagination. The film isn't for children. It's not a laugh a minute, or even a solid plot. But, it has enough humor, some crazy antics, and good chase and action scenes to entertain adults. Here are a couple favorite lines. For more dialog, see the Quotes section on this IMDb Web page of the film.Woman in doctor's office, ""Are you feeling all right?"" Jack Putter, ""Would I be in a doctor's office if I was feeling all right?""Dr. Greenbush, ""Good news, Jack. I think we can rule out demonic possession right off the bat.""

19,Mr-Fusion,What's not to like?,7,16 August 2015,"The idea for ""InnerSpace"" is a novel one for a movie, and I can't shake the feeling that this is the kind of movie that could only have been pulled off in the '80s. Can you imagine how bland a remake today would be? Anyhoo, the whole package is a good bit of fun. It's stuffed with both plot and memorable characters (the gunhand robot guy, the cowboy, the charming Meg Ryan, and Martin Short, who shoulders the story's wacky physical comedy like a pro). This is a movie that you just sort of get lost in, and really feels like a big Hollywood riff on Disney rides. Which could be its own genre, at this point.7/10",Innerspace
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A wonderfully practical and charmingly inventive ode to science-fiction of the fifties.,6,17 April 2018,"All of the microscopic special-effects in 'Innerspace (1987)'are superbly tangible, brought to life with incredibly tactile practical methods that really lend a believability to the inherently absurd concept that insists their inclusion, and even the more outlandish set-pieces later on are delivered with such a cleverly inventive and endearingly vigorous hands-on approach that it's hard not to smile, even though the impressively high-flying stunt-work seems a little out of place and the forced-perspective elements in the final act make for some obviously phoney, if funny, effects. The plot becomes increasingly silly as the feature goes on and a few holes start to appear in the narrative once it stretches closer towards its two-hour goal, but it's clear that the flick wants to take inspiration from the pulpy science-fiction of the fifties and it's charming enough that the most ridiculous moments can be allowed to pass with less than a sigh, especially since it's entertaining throughout and pretty funny, too. 6/10",Innerspace
21,bowmanblue,Watch it before it gets remade,8,30 April 2018,"Everyone remembers that eighties sci-fi classic 'Back to the Future,' because - let's face it - it's awesome. It deserves it's spot in pop culture. Yet many people don't seem to hold that other eighties sci-fi popcorn flick 'Innerspace' in such quite high regards. And that's a shame... in my humble opinion, because it really is quite good fun.In these days of 'shared universes' (thanks, Marvel!) I find myself seeing films that look like they could belong in the same 'universe' as others (like 'Universal Soldier' and 'Terminator 2' - again, just my opinion). And, after my most recent re-watch of 'Innerspace' I couldn't help but thinking how much it would fit alongside that time-travelling DeLorean and uber-cool hoverboard. It's about a test piolt (Dennis Quaid) who gets miniaturised inside a pod during a lab experiment and then (inadvertantly) injected into some random guy's backside (Martin Short). The two of them form an unlikely bond as they try to reverse the effects before Quaid runs out of oxygen (or the baddies get hold of them!).Now, it's fair to say that 'Innerspace' didn't set the Box Office as on fire as its producers would have liked. I don't think it bombed, but the film-makers were hoping for something akin to 'Back to the Future' in terms of success-levels. However, there's just something so fun about it that it deserves to be remembered, especially during this period of eighties nostalgia.It's first strength is that it never slows down. It's perfectly edited so that you get almost straight into the action and learn to love the characters without any need for lengthy exposition or backstory. And the action flows thick and fast. There's one chase scene that reminded me of 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.' In 'Indy 4' they had to rely on awful computer graphics whereas 'Innerspace' managed it with stunts.Another thing that's worth mentioning is how when there's no action, there's humour. And this is down to the rapport between the actors. Everyone plays their part well. And, possibly the most important thing about 'Innerspace' is that it's a film that the whole family can enjoy. There's no need for violence or bad language. It acomplishes everything it needs to without any over-the-topness.If you saw this back in the day, give it another go. Or if you're just looking for something to entertain the kids on a wet weekend, this should be enjoyed by all (even if you're not part of this current eighties revival!).",Innerspace
22,The-Sarkologist,A Charming 80s Film,6,1 September 2021,"This is another one of those films that I remember being somewhat heavily promoted, and doing the rounds on television back in the eighties. I even remembered watching it because, well, it was science-fiction. Apparently it is supposed to be a comedy as well, though I have to admit that I didn't find it particularly funny. I guess throwing Martin Short in as a guy that believes he suffers from every disease under the sun, as well as being socially inept, was supposed to do this, but having seen lots of movies like this, the jokes sort of start to wear thin.I could say that this is a remake of Fantastic Journey, but in a way it isn't. The thing is that back in the eighties filmmakers would rehash ideas from earlier years, but since I never really paid too much attention to movies from before I was born, I never had developed a fascination with cult movies from that era, not like these days where remakes from the 80s are met with scorn, derision, and outright hostility.Like Fantastic Journey, this movie is about a technology that is developed to miniaturise people, and machines, so that they can be injected into other creatures, but just as they are about to begin the tests, the lab is raided by an organisation that attempts to steal the technology. However, one of the scientists escapes with the syringe containing the minaturised test pilot, who then injects it into Martin Short before being killed by one of the bad guys.The film then proceeds like one of those spy type thrillers, where Short communicates with the pilot inside of him in an attempt to get the other chip off of the thieves, as well as looking for a way to get him out of his body so as to return him to full size before he runs out of oxygen. Along the way Short begins to develop confidence in himself, as he begins to realise that there is more to him that he originally suspected, and of course comes out of the movie a much better man. In fact, as he drives off in pursuit of the bad guys at the end of the film, the image of a James Bond like agent comes to mind. In fact, the way he turns down his offers, offers that he would have jumped at at the beginning of the film, does demonstrate how far he has come.I guess that is something about this film that does set it apart from a lot of other films that I have watched, and that is how the main character grows from lacking any confidence, and being a hypochondriac, to somebody who is incredibly sure of himself. In fact, the woman that he was trying to chat up at the beginning of the film, who really didn't want to give him much time, turns around at the end and proposes a relationship with him, though of course he turns it down because, well, there is the proviso that it isn't exclusive.Yeah, come to think of it, this film actually isn't all that bad, and it is certainly not something that you tend to come across these days. Sure, the plot isn't exactly original, but it still has some charm about it.",Innerspace
23,Thanos_Alfie,A different kind of adventure...,6,8 July 2020,"""Innerspace"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a test pilot being miniaturized and getting into a man's body. Now he has to find out a way to communicate with this man and try to get back to his original form.I liked this movie because it was interesting, funny and had a very good plot. The direction which was made by Joe Dante was very good and I enjoyed the way that the different parts of the human body were presented to us when the test pilot was inside the other man's body. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that Dennis Quaid who played as Lt.

Under the direction of Joe Dante (one of the brighter stars in the Steven Spielberg galaxy) it exhibits quite a bit of slapstick flair, while wasting most of its comic potential on frantic over-plotting and miles of distracting hardware.The idea is almost clever: during a top-secret miniaturization experiment cocky test pilot Dennis Quaid is accidentally injected with his self-contained capsule into the bloodstream of meek, nervous supermarket clerk Martin Short (never mind how or why). But the tone is often uncertain (is Martin Short's howl of pain when he feels tiny grappling hooks on the back of his eyeball supposed to be funny?) and the extraneous plot details – spies, car chases, a cybernetic villain, a beautiful girlfriend (naturally a reporter) – haven't changed much since the last action/comedy hit.

Many of Innerspace's best moments are when it embraces that truth and leans into the idiocy - the story's mustache-twirling villains are all playfully over-the-top - but it's wishy-washy about that and doesn't always seem like it's completely in on its own jokes. The plot is super redundant, too, with its heroes escaping capture no less than five different times and way too many evil masterminds / sinister henchmen crammed into the scenery.

Looking at it 33 years later I still appreciate its spectacle and a number of memorable scenes, but can see its flaws.The premise is excellent and the plot starts off unfolding in pretty entertaining way with an effective mix of sci-fi, adventure and comedy. Unfortunately it veers off in a number random, silly directions and after a while I personally start to feel the length and want it to conclude. Towards the end it tries to pull back towards the initial excitement, but by that point it's almost lost me.I love pretty much everything up until Putter has to obtain the microchip and this for me is where things start to go wrong. The movie tries to increase the comedy level and it hurts the flow of the plot with the result for me being a bit uneven. I accept that comedy is in the eye of the beholder so if you enjoy the humour it probably won't bother you much.All the sci-fi, tech and effects are excellent and still holds up to today's standard. I am a fan of 'The Fantastic Voyage' so loved the 80s take on the same concept. In fact I enjoyed Joe Dante's numerous homages to the classic Hollywood sci-fi era with his casting choices and some of the filming locations.All actors do a great job in their roles. Dennis Quaid feels like Pete 'Maverick' with a tiny bit of Han Solo thrown in, whilst Martin Short is as funny as ever. Meg Ryan is sweet and charming as the reporter love interest, but it's not her most challenging role.Aside from the deliberate casting of Kevin McCarthy, I found most of the antagonists to be quite uninspired. As much as I love Robert Picardo I thought the character of The Cowboy was unnecessary.The supporting players contain many of the usual suspects from the Joe Dante filmography and they all make solid contributions as ever.Being a big Sam Cooke fan I definitely appreciate the soundtrack with some songs being quite well placed.",Innerspace

This miniaturization device is highly sought after by other evil forces and during an attempt at stealing the device, Quaid's character is injected into a troubled man, played by Martin Short. There are definitely some funny bits involved with the Quaid's character trying to communicate with his new host and Martin Short is perfect for the style of humor that they deploy in this scenario. At this point in the movie, I felt promise for it, but about halfway through the plot becomes rather convoluted after some other characters are introduced that are trying to gain access to this sought-after device. One character named ""Cowboy"" is not funny at all, and his influence on the movie literally tears it apart to the point where the viewer stops caring and the movie becomes a typical chase-scene filled mess. The initial humor, which should have been built upon, is totally flushed out of the movie and it never returns from this point. What could have been a funny movie because of the talent of the actors instead becomes a pretty un-necessary waste of about 1 hour and a half. So, watch the first half hour then turn it off because the rest if not worth your time.",Innerspace

It concerns hotshot pilot Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) a brash dude who is taking part in a miniaturization experiment conducted in secret. When criminals bent on stealing the technology interrupt the process midway, the head doctor panics and flees, injecting now microscopic Tuck and his craft into the first person he stumbles, twitchy hypochondriac Jack (a manic, slightly irritating Martin Short).

All the while he's stuck in Jack's body in minute form, dodging blood cells, stomach acid and more in some truly magnificent special effects. The baddies are very comical, yet mean just enough business to do their job of being threatening, played by Kevin McCarthy, Robert Picardo (okay, he's purely comical, with no hint of threat), Fiona Lewis and a terrific Vernon Wells as a terminator inspired spook.

This extremely lively comedy concerns the misadventures of inept supermarket assistant manager Jack Putter (Martin Short), who is accidentally injected with a microscopic pod which contains a crack pilot who was supposed to be exploring a rabbit. So while Jack is beside himself with fears of demonic possession (he's hearing the voice of pilot Tuck Pendleton - Dennis Quaid), he is being pursued by government agencies and ruthless criminals. It all might sound rather fantastic, and it is, in the best possible way! Comic genius Martin Short really makes this movie his own with some outrageous antics (not unlike Jerry Lewis) that carry scene after scene, hilariously. Second billing really should go to Kevin McCarthy (though his is a small role) for his eccentric portrayal of Scrimshaw, the megalomaniac criminal who is 'just in it for the money'. Also great is Wendy Schaal, a checkout chick who is a little unsure about whether she should be dating the erratic Jack. Dennis Quaid makes a rugged, handsome hero while his real life wife Meg Ryan is a pretty heroine, in one of her better roles. Other strong support comes from Fiona Lewis and Henry Gibson.Director Dante and screenwriters Chip Proser and Jeffrey Boam (Proser wrote the original story) have a ball with the wild premise (based loosely on ""Fantastic Voyage"" - 1966) and milk the comedy aspect dry, whilst the Academy Award winning visual effects team recreate the inside of the human body spectacularly, and Jerry Goldsmith provides a very effective and at times rousing score.""Innerspace"" is one of those movies that's loads of fun no matter how many times you see it!

Innerspace is probably one of the greats in that category, mixing in some great special effects (for its time) and some hillarious performances by Martin Short and Dennis Quaid. But what I especially enjoyed was the concept, turning a film that could have been serious and urgent into a film that was both funloving and interesting to watch.

But when the lab is attacked and he is accidentally injected into Jack Putter, a hypochondriac supermarket clerk, he and Jack need to team up fast to recover a vital silicon chip needed to restore him to normal size.Innerspace is a brilliant but flawed film, which has a terrible first two scenes, but then almost instantly picks up into a great loopy sci-fi comedy thriller. Its problem is its script, which has some great central ideas (miniaturisation, espionage) but lumbers them with a boring love story involving that old Lois Lane heroine standby, the plucky reporter. The result is that the two male leads have to try and balance the more insane moments with conventional angst, while McCarthy (as a mad industrialist), Lewis (as a mad scientist), Picardo (as a mad smuggler) and Wells (as a mad killer) all have a whale of a time with a total comic-book approach. I suspect Chip Proser's original screenplay was much more of the latter, but the studio railed the filmmakers back into making a more mainstream film. If so that's a shame, but it's still a great movie, a terrific revision of Fantastic Voyage with excellent visual effects by Dennis Muren and Rob Bottin, as Tuck floats through Jack's bloodstream, clamps onto his optic nerve and fights a pitched battle in his stomach. It also features great sets by James Spencer, terrific costumes by Rosanna Norton (the first shot of McCarthy in his perfect white suit looking over the Golden Gate is sensational), cool stunts and great turns by all of Dante's regular bit players. Also, for bizarre casting, how about this; the key role of Ozzie the good-guy scientist is played by Dante's usual cameraman, John Hora (who didn't shoot this film), and very good he is too. Produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin' company, this is a thoroughly entertaining and very enjoyable gas of a movie which pretty much keeps you smiling throughout.

As a true testament to Spielberg and the great actors, this movie has aged very little. If it weren't for the very young Meg Ryan, Dennis Quaid, Martin Short and Robert Picardo, you could say that this movie is a fairly recent release. In this regards, it is a typical 80's movie. You have the fallen hero (Dennis Quaid), his estranged love (Meg Ryan), and the fool that saves them both (Martin Short). There is also the usual dash of bad 80's clothing and techno rhythms. However, Innerspace is not really a typical 80's movie. Much of the plot is taken from the sci-fi classic, The Fantastic Voyage. However, Innerspace takes the idea from that movie to a whole new level. Not only that, but Innerspace is an action-comedy, with a little bit a romance tied it.

You get the sense that he gets as exasperated with Jack as we the audience do. Quaid can really deliver when given the right material, something that Hollywood provides all too scarcely.  (POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREON)   Short overacts but is still pretty funny, and anyway, I suppose exaggeration is forgivable given that he's playing a neurotic.  Ryan is cute but in all honesty is not given that much to work with.  It's credit to her talent that she manages to stand out at all.  Mr Igo is a cool villain, but one of many elements in the plot that aren't exploited to their full potential.  The film is so bursting with invention that often things are touched upon and then dropped before they've really been explored.  This all goes to show, however, that the film doesn't stand still for a minute, which can only be a good thing, especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.   It's fair to say that amidst all the general good fun the special effects aren't always something you notice, but they are superb, especially for '87. Never once do they undermine the story.  It really is Quaid's film though, personal favourite lines including ""Dip, Dip, Dip all you like.  Nothin's gonna fit ya"" and ""You better, you two-faced sonofab**ch""  An absolute blast from start to finish; this really is unfairly overlooked as being 'just another remake of 'Fantastic Voyage'"", when in reality it compares well with acknowledged classics of the comedy adventure genre such as ""Back to the Future"".",Innerspace

Tuck Pendleton is taking place in a miniaturization experiment where his ship is going to be shrunk with him in it, and then he's going to be injected into an animal to explore. Like all good 80's capers things go wrong. The lab conducting the experiment is targeted by a squad of goons working for a rival, instead of an animal (a rabbit FTR); Pendleton is accidentally injected into hapless store clerk Jack Putter, played by Martin Short. And so, the adventure begins. Putter has to race against time with Pendleton inside him to resolve the accident, failure to do so will result in Pendleton growing to normal size while inside Putter - which will be a bloody mess. Although I'm not a fan of Martin Short, the casting is good in this film. There is a great balance between Quaid's very confident persona, and Short's shy, paranoid and hypochondriac portrayal. The special effects in this film, in particularly the shots which were supposed to be inside of a human body look a little dated now as my trained eye can see the mesh from green screen to genuine footage - but when I watched this as a child I was awestruck at how authentic it looked. This was a great family movie in 1987 and due to a decent story this film is still a great family movie, falling into the sci-fi/adventure genre.

Naturally, the effects would be much better if the film was made today.There are also many laugh-out-loud scenes in the film, but as all comedies Innerspace goes on for too long and in the end I just wanted the film to be over. Overall though, it's an entertaining movie that would have benefited from being about 15 minutes shorter than it is. (6/10)",Innerspace
52,DavidSim240183,One of Joe Dante's best.,9,20 February 2004,"When Joe Dante wanted to do a remake of Fantastic Voyage, I liked the way he decided to make his version into a comedy. I was surprised to discover that this film wasn't too successful, because I believe Innerspace is good solid entertainment, albeit daft.The story begins when Lt Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid), an excellent pilot but an irresponsible hard drinker volunteers for a highly unusual experiment. He will be placed inside a submersible pod, and with the use of two microchips, be miniaturised and injected into a laboratory rabbit (called Bugs, what is it about Joe Dante and Looney Tunes characters anyway?).But just after Tuck has been shrunk, a group of Silicon Valley industrial spies break into the lab, and steal one of the microchips necessary to reverse the miniaturisation process. In desperation, one of the scientists (Ozzie) runs with the syringe Tuck is in, and injects him into the body of Jack Putter (Martin Short).Jack is a stressed out hypochondriac who is terrified of life, and learning that a shrunken human being is inside his body doesn't make him any less neurotic. With Tuck and Jack now having to depend on each other for survival, they team up with Tuck's ex girlfriend Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan) to recover the stolen chip before Tuck's air supply runs out.I must confess to being a sucker for these loser comes out on top stories, and this film is no exception. Jack is a man who has nothing going for him in life, but with Tuck urging him on, Jack manages to find inner confidence he never knew he had and takes control of his life.Both Tuck and Jack's characters go through changes in this film. Seeing the world through Jack's eyes, Tuck begins to reflect upon the mistakes he has made in his life. His irresponsible behaviour and heavy drinking was responsible for Lydia breaking up with him, and he wouldn't be in the situation he's in now if he hadn't recklessly gone through with this hare brained experiment.Dennis Quaid makes a likable character as Tuck, because although he is a wise guy, his pep talks to Jack are quite inspiring and how you can learn to take control of your own destiny.Martin Short is also a likable hero as Jack, although he does have a tendency to go over the top. Although he is supposed to be neurotic, his antics can grate on you a little on occasion. Some of his antics can be funny too, such as the crazy dance he does in Tuck's apartment, and yelling ""I'm possessed"" when he first hears Tuck's voice inside his head.The different scrapes they get into are quite exciting, such as Jack's hanging on for dear life at the back of a refrigerated truck (although it is a little overlong). Tuck's battle with one of the spies inside Jack's body is very well done, and the method of killing him is quite innovative too.One of the funniest scenes is when Tuck alters Jack's face to look like The Cowboy (Robert Picardo), someone who has come to buy the microchip off Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy), the man responsible for stealing the chip in the first place. The special FX for these scenes are pretty amazing, and the look on everyone's faces during these transformations are priceless.The FX used for inside Jack's body are incredible, and are totally realistic. One of the best scenes is when Tuck is nearly pulled into Jack's heart, and is very nail biting. Another good scene is when Tuck ends up in Lydia's body through a kiss with Jack, and sees his unborn child in her womb. That is a very awe inspiring scene, and is worthy of the same fascination that made Fantastic Voyage great.I believe this is a criminally underrated film. Admittedly, its a hard film to swallow, with things like altering Jack's face to look like someone else. How exactly could you do that? But this is a Joe Dante film, so you have to suspend disbelief a little. Meg Ryan isn't given enough to do, and its a pity her character couldn't have been given enough development.There are also a lot of things happening in this film, and not everything is tied up like it should have been. The way Innerspace ends, there could have been a sequel, but so far it hasn't been followed up. With Dennis Quaid's and Meg Ryan's divorce that doesn't seem very likely now.Still, Quaid has got a brilliant rapport with Short, and some (if not all) of the important matters are resolved. Its an entertaining film, and you find yourself being pulled along for the ride whether you like it or not. After Gremlins, Innerspace is my favourite Joe Dante film.",Innerspace
53,bix171,Short Gets Shafted,5,9 April 2003,"Joe Dante can't get a rhythm going in his slapstick revisiting of `Fantastic Voyage' because the script by Chip Proser and Jeffrey Boam is talky from the onset. Ostensibly a showcase for the gifted physical comedian Martin Short, Proser and Boam seem to want to segregate Short's antics to certain sections to allow them to concentrate on exposition (which itself is quite uninteresting) and hence Short's excesses come in fits and starts. They're good while they last (his elastic facial expressions are priceless) but they're over too quickly. He's aided by Dennis Quaid as a washed-up Navy lieutenant who is miniaturized in an experiment but accidentally ends up in Short's body. The possibilities are inviting and usually up Dante's alley but the script doesn't want to take advantage of them (Short and Quaid can converse but a funnier concept--Quaid having the ability to manipulate Short a la Steve Martin by Lily Tomlin in `All Of Me'--never seems to occur to the writers) and instead we're forced to focus on the dull, blurry visuals that have none of the wit and inventiveness of the film that inspired it. With Meg Ryan (lackluster as usual), and, as the bad guys, Kevin McCarthy and Fiona Lewis, both of whom have very little talent for the kind of hamming that is usually one of the primary pleasures of a Joe Dante picture.",Innerspace

Too bad is that the inner part of the movie is not shown. The story should shown more on the body itself and not just a common red blood cells.

55,quaseprovisorio,it's a very fun and entretaining adventure by the master joe dante.,8,5 July 2020,"Joe dante is one of the most underrated filmmakers ever. for me he is. his movies are always very immaginative, full of different ideas, the characters are smart and fun, and mostly there's always but always a desire to move forward, to give to the audience something unexpected, something he thinks they never seen before. i might be repeating myself because in ""the howling"" review i kinda said the same thing but it's true. what's the other movie where you have dennis quaid inside martin short? none.in 2018 leigh whannel did a movie called ""upgrade"" which i really enjoyed and had a software system put inside of a guy. he also listened one voice of control (it's not a spoiler, it happens at the beggining of the movie don't worry). yes it's more tecnologically developed but i thought when i saw it that it was a clever move. and it was. but i wonder if he saw innerspace before, because it's kinda the same thing. in terms of execution both of films are pretty good even though i think upgrade has a better pacing and innerspace has more creativity.so the plot: experiment where dennis quaid is shrunk inide of a type of submarine. instead of going to a rabbit he goes to a store clerk, martin short the most insecure guy on the planet. meg ryan also has an important part as quaid's love interest in conflict, because quaid's character loves to get loaded. the thing is: there are so many cool moves this film makes that i can't count all of them. there are a bunch of memorable things, for example the meeting with scrimshaw or the ""terminator guy"", or the bunch of sequences short's body has problems. that are more but i don't want to spoil.the film lacks a bit pacing like i said. i think two hours is probably too long. the movie never gets boring because dante's never ceases to give us new things, but i think the movie would benefit with less 20 minutes. and he has a very energetic direction, where the music also helps. plus martin short gives a great performance, for me he is the heart of the film. the special effects are good? sure they are, the movie even received an oscar for that. but without short and mostly joe dante at the helm this could have been just average or worse.again: watching a joe dante film is usually expect the unexpected. is like going to a thrill ride without knowing how it will be. because at every minute anything can happen. if there's a guy that for me understands what entertainment is suposed to be, that guy is joe dante. because the man is not afraid to innovate, is not afraid to do what movies for me are for: surprise and fascinate the viewers. sometimes movies do that with great camera shots or fascinating dialogues, or elaborate metaphors. sometimes what we need is a face change or an injection in your butt.it's the best of dante? no, i still loved matinee more. is it a great film? it's a very good one. but it has the extra of the immagination that never seems to stop. hence this grade.",Innerspace
56,MJB784,My favorite sci-fi movie,10,23 May 2018,"This is probably the least known and most unusual choice of my favorites, but it combines comedy, sci-fi, action, suspense, drama and romance as effortlessly as Back to the Future. The story keeps building as it goes along. A navy pilot named Tuck Pendelton has agreed to be miniaturized in a syringe once he's first placed inside a space pod. His goal is to discover the inside of a rabbit, but soon the syringe he is in is being held captive by a doctor who is being chased by scientists from another organization that want to steal the syringe and claim the experiment themselves. Soon, the doctor injects the syringe into an innocent civilian played by Martin Short and through complications is trying to get Tuck out of his body once they communicate through the monitors of Tuck's pod seeing everything that Tuck sees through the pupils of the Jack's eye and audio through his inner ears which are recorded through the speaker's of the pod. The attention to detail of the human body is extraordinary. It really looks like actual footage of the human body and it blends with the on set footage of Tuck cruising through it flawlessly. The movie won a well deserved Oscar for Visual Effects and it features some of the most timeless effects I've seen on film.",Innerspace
57,richspenc,Takes me back,8,20 March 2017,"I like 80s movies like this that take me back to my youth growing up in the 80s. Martin Short as the clumsy hypochondriac who sees his doctor in a nervous wreck and is told he has to learn to relax. His over the top nervousness reminded me of Mel Brook's 70s film ""High anxiety"" where Mel acts in a similar way, like someone who just had 10 caffeinated cans of soda. Short, after telling his doctor about a freaky dream of him helping an arragant woman customer at the grocery store he works at and him first, somehow ringing up extreme prices for her items (I like how she says ""that's a little pricey for shampoo, don't ya think?), and then, the lady pulling a small gun on him, with him then waking up in a panic. Only a short time later, it happens for real at the store exactly like in his dream, and then the gun part, turns out to be a lighter. It doesn't matter; Short, who was already a jangled mess, completely snaps at the store in front of everyone. At a lab nearby, scientists are setting up an experiment for Dennis Quaid to be miniaturized in a submarine and be injected into a rabbit. Quiad gets into a sub, the sub starts spinning incredibly fast, then shrinks to microscopic size, and then pushes off into a syringe. High tech criminals bust into the lab to try to take over, a scientist with the syringe with Quaid inside it flees to a mall, and accidentally injects the syringe with Quaid into Short, who was at the mall to book a relaxation vacation (sorry Short, change of plans). The scientist gets shot, with his last experience being a bunch of people in animal costumes standing over him, and funny animal noises forming into his last conscious few seconds while looking at the people in the animal costumes. That bizarre moment was something particularly of the 80s where other bizarre style 80s films like ""Killer Klowns from outer space"" provided similar moments. We then get our story of Quaid traveling through the inside of Short's body, with fairly convincing special effects, to hook gadgets from his craft up to the insides of his eyes and ears to be able to talk to short and to be able to see whatever Short sees. The next hour of the film revolves around Quaid's and Short's experience of the two of them talking to each other, Short meeting Quaids girlfriend Meg Ryan (she was so young and beautiful here)(Short to Meg: ""Lydia, shut up and listen! "" Quaid from inside : ""wow, you said it good""), Short explaining to Quaid's lab partners what's happened (I like how Quaid on the inside says ""you better help out you two faced sonofabitch!"", and Short tells them ""he says 'thank you'""), and then Quaid and Short going after the bad guys. I always liked the bad guy, who looks all serious and intimidating in his suit and shades, with the machanical hand who can shoot from his finger like a gun, totally freaking out a kid in the mall while doing it. I also like the scene where Short drinks some whiskey, Quaid catches it with a vile while sitting in Shorts throat and drinks some himself, and the two of them live it up for a few minutes dancing around intoxicated (Quaid: ""let the good times roll""). I found quite funny the scene where Short turns on the TV and Quaid says ""oh great, I'm inside a guy who likes game shows"". And also funny when Shorts TV and the monitor inside Quads ship catches fire at the same time, and then hilarious the way Short jumps while holding the fire extinguisher when Quaid calls his name. I also liked the scene in the doctors waiting room with Quaid on the inside of Short talking to him and the other people in the waiting room thinking he's talking to them, one of them asking if he was all right and Short yelling ""would I be in a doctors office if I was feeling all right!?"" I also liked Short and Meg's kissing scene with Quaid temporarily transferring over to inside Meg's body and finding a certain surprise. They could've done with out the unessessary add- on of the cowboy. It crossed the time limit of the movie over into slightly too long.",Innerspace

It didn't work here.I feel a bit sorry for Dennis Quaid, I usually like his films, but nobody involved with this stinker had much choice, especially Dennis.It didn't even work as fluffy, mindless entertainment, as some Spielberg films do, I just can't ignore the bad science and the misplaced humour.I gave it a 3, simply because I managed to sit right through to the end.",Innerspace
61,CherryBlossomBoy,A tramp and a loser,9,23 March 2011,"A blonde bimbo leaves the guy she loves but who is slightly too wild for her taste. She goes through other guys but she keeps seeing her ex in them. First a stereotypical nerd, then a stereotypical macho... and then she decides the guy from the beginning was the right one after all. During the process he himself learns a valuable lesson on dependability. Hardly a premise for a sci-fi about exploring human body in a manned capsule shrunk to the size of a bacteria, isn't it? Of course it is. The premise is a screwball comedy and a very good at that. I just felt the need to toy around with symbolics I chose to pick up and attract the reader to my review. But who knows what the writer had in mind while piecing the puzzle that is the script for ""Innerspace"".This is something of a remake of ""Fantastic Voyage"" where the idea of traveling through human body was first explored but treated respectfully and with sense of awe. The new version is far superior, not only because special effects are immensely better but because of the right approach. Special effects will only take film as far as marveling at the sights of human insides can last. And it doesn't last long. For instance, who would watch in awe a kidney or a colon (and its contents)? Doctors yes, average viewer no. You can't awe at it but you can certainly laugh. Add the ludicrous idea of shrinking a human to fit inside another human (quite unscientific when you consider physics alone, not to mention chemistry) and the only solution is - a screwball comedy with as many metaphorical jokes it can possibly muster out of the fantastic situation. Similar concept is seen six years later in ""Groundhog Day"" where a character is put in another fantastic situation and all the good jokes stem from that.In this context a story of a bimbo fits quite nicely, although her ex that she ""sees"" in other guys is literally inside other guys. Explicitness is avoided, this is a family flick, she doesn't really sleep with those guys, rather ""chases the truth"" through a series of perilous events, but there you have it. A great metaphor of true love. Another story could be a story of a man who gets rejected by a girl he adores. His ego is shrunk (and indeed his body) and he assumes identities of stereotypical people hoping she would like him better that way. Not being his real self leaves him without air to breathe. Just seconds before he dies his former personality reasserts itself. He is himself again and, after he simply apologizes for being an arse, the lady takes him back. A great metaphor about the need to just be yourself. Of course there's a take on industrialism and corruption of big corporations, a hint at espionage and governmental control of an individual, but I find this little romantic variations much more interesting. They may not be true or even there in the script but I did keep your attention till the end of this article.",Innerspace
62,DoctorSkyTower,GREAT MOVIE!!,9,12 July 1999,"I saw this ages ago, having recently watched on video. Normally I find comedies not worth watching twice, but Innerspace still made me laugh - even after all this time!!Martin Short's character Jack Putter was great. He was a wimpy nerd, perfect to be injected in the butt by the doc carrying Dennis Quaid. I liked the part where his face was changed to the Cowboy's and back again. Very funny!!Meg Ryan was a bit of a pain-in-the-butt (no pun intended), tho I think she should've married Jack, he was the cuter one!!! Dennis Quaid was great in this movie also, even confined to a teeny tiny pod floating around in Martins insides.The inside-the-body SFX were cool. The scenes where Dennis had to escape the heart, plus the parts where he gets to see thru Martin's eyes etc really made good effects. It makes you wonder how you'd feel if that happened to you, Martin's reactions are priceless!!!The bad guys provided plenty of comic relief, I like Cowboy's sleez and the big thug who fainted every time he saw something 'horrible'.  The scene where Martin's hanging off the back of the truck was rather cool.I recommend this flick to anyone who likes sci fi, comedy, romance, action, adventure! Because this movie has the lot!!I give this flick 9 out of 10.",Innerspace

Dante effortlessly mixes comedy, science fiction and romance ensuring a wide audience appeal.Being a Joe Dante movie there are many in-jokes, movie references and cameos that add to the fun, especially for movie geeks like myself, and there's a lot of fun to be had as we venture into various parts of the body as Quaid's Tuck Pendleton firstly tries to come to terms with the host body he finds himself in then tries to help Martin Short's character foil a terrorist sub-plot that got him unwittingly involved in the first place.",Innerspace

Dennis Quaid is a drunken fighter pilot who gets injected into Martin Short's spastic everyman body. Short must find a way to get Quaid and his little machine out of his insides before an evil group of evil scientists take him out....permanently! It's fun and goofy and way-way too long for this premise. Side plots with the buyer of stolen goods ""The Cowboy"" seem like filler and although Quaid and Short have great chemistry which lasts for the whole film, Short's spastic routine isn't really my cup of tea in this film. The Quaid Meg Ryan relationship was fine, but also seemed like it was added in just to pad out parts of the film. As I said, while entertaining, Innerspace adds up to a lot of running around, chase scenes, and Short dancing like his bones are breaking at the same time.I still found it to be mostly entertaining though, and I would recommend it if you haven't seen it.

However, chaos follows and he finds himself accidentally injected into a human store clerk, who ends up being chased by the bad guys. The plot feels original though the movie contains lots of clichés and pretty much follows the usual genre rules.A barely credible sequence of events follow when Pendleton manages to hook up with the store clerk's eyes and ears, and a lot of the comedy is based on the interplay between these two characters. This includes Pendleton's on/off relationship with journalist Lydia Maxwell, played by Meg Ryan in an early role.Stupid as the premise may be, it offers a fresh perspective and some entertaining comedy, so if you're looking for 90 minutes of light-hearted 80s fun this movie is worth taking a look at.",Innerspace

I still remember how much amazed I was when I first saw it. I saw it so many times after that and I was enjoying it each time while I was watching it. You can see the movies like this one these days. There weren't technologies which they could use to create such effects. That's why they (the effects) were just a part from the story and they weren't as many as they're in todays movies. The movies were so good because they were done with a real imagination.Now the story some how stays like a background for the effects. They're doing movies which are rather like 3D PC games.

77,scriff998,"Energetic, imaginative fantasy/comedy",7,4 November 2014,"This was a fun movie, kept a good balance between sci-fi, action, fantasy and comedy. It had a lot of imagination. It was a little more lightweight than most of the movies I like, I could tell that's the way they wanted it in a scene where the bad guys take over a lab by spraying the doctors with tranquilizer gas instead of shooting them. That may be the reason it didn't do good at the box office, it was PG around the time the PG-13 rating was becoming more lucrative. The only thing I didn't like was the scientists being shrunk at the end, it seemed a little silly. The ending kind of leaves you hanging, the producers were probably hoping the film would do well enough for a sequel. Overall, not great but good if you're looking for interesting 80's film artifacts.",Innerspace

79,liamwuthrich-838-982823,inner space,10,18 February 2012,great movie love Dennis Quaid movies i own a few also i love martin short in Capitan Ron and other movie i saw him in also was Anthony Edward coach tom cruse and other actor over the year because of his involvement in the revenge of the nerd movie and i only don't no if tom cruse Dennis Quaid would be coached to do a movie to gather like the remaking of top gun and adding Megan fox to the bill-it and the other stand in and actors if tony Scott and other made a villain top gun involving Russia or japan or Cuba or Australia with all the show and TV that has come to Canada and the state from those country but if only the perfect script could be made with a budget and the red tap and department usually called upon to produce a movie also inner space was a great movie for that Ara with the current copy right law in-place and safety for the actor and crew's filming the movie at the directer admin department. also i still think tom and a great number of actor have issue with acting in movies but they have accept those values from day one and there agents and all support personnel off set and on set respect that because of all the changes and in Powell river change is good.,Innerspace
80,michaelkendall2,Joe Dante Classic,10,10 July 2005,"This 1987 film is a wonderful combination of sci-fi, comedy, romance and thriller elements. It is briskly paced despite being almost two hours in length, and features superb performances from the leads; Dennis Quaid is excellent as usual, as is Meg Ryan in her best role. Yet the plaudits must go to Martin Short in a truly great performance he has never matched. He just needs the right role. The supporting cast are great as well; the delightful villainy of Vernon Wells who is unrecognisable as usual! Also Robert Picardo camping it up superbly as The Cowboy, one of his most memorable creations, plus the great pairing of Fiona Lewis and Kevin McCarthy, who memorably says to his dog before feeding it: 'Never beg, never beg!' The cinematography and special effects/makeup are all great as well, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is brilliant, perfectly complementing the tone of the film, alternately exciting/sprightly/romantic. Joe Dante binds it all together with magnificent verve, plus Dick Miller makes his trademark appearance! A great, timeless classic. Highly recommended.",Innerspace
81,MovieLegend,Phenomenal idea... comes up a little short,6,30 April 2019,"Innerspace is a movie that starts with a fantastic premise, but in my opinion fails to take advantage of its opportunities with such interesting potential.We begin with Navy experimental test pilot Lt. Tuck Pendleton (Quaid) who has been bypassed for ""real"" test pilot work due to his problem with authority. He's now been relegated to work of a sketchier variety, involving being placed inside of a space probe-like vessel and miniaturized down to cell size. The intention is for him to be injected into a rabbit (for scientific purposes), with perhaps the future promise of the technology being used to study humans. However shortly after the success of the miniaturization process, armed thieves break into the lab to steal the technology and the main lab director must escape with Pendleton who is now tiny and floating inside of a syringe.A chase ensues with the lab director running for his life from a professional assassin. Ending up in a shopping mall, the lab director gets subtly shot (by of all means)... with a finger gun and now realizing he only has moments to live, he encounters the naturally docile Jack Putter (Short), having just left a travel agency to reserve his doctor prescribed vacation in order to ease his nerves.With his last breaths, the lab director injects the syringe (containing Pendleton) into the buttocks of a mystified Putter. The lab director then collapses to the floor and dies. Not knowing what has happened with the contents of the syringe, our assassin steals a camera from a bystander who was taking photos of the incident... the camera perhaps containing the only clues as to what happened with the syringe?As you can see, the story sets up nicely with lots of science fiction, action, and in the case of Martin Short, some very humorous potential. While Short delivers on some very funny scenes involving Putter figuring out just what has happened to him, the movie overall suffers from not taking full advantage of its opportunities. A few of the scenes are hilarious, including Putter suddenly hearing a tiny voice inside of his head. He thinks he is possessed when really Pendleton has attached his probe to the inner parts of Putter's ear and is able to amplify his voice so Putter can hear him. The material really tickles your imagination with just the possibility of something like this really being able to happen and Short really does a tremendous job with his funny facial quirks and erratic behavior as he uncovers what is happening to him. Unfortunately this doesn't last and the movie devolves into more of a focus on Pendleton and Lydia Maxwell's (Ryan) love story. Instead of keeping the focus on Martin who was the star of the film, we are left with a sentimental love story gone wrong and more chase scenes. As a result the 2nd half of the movie isn't as interesting. I still was intrigued by the first half of the film and was mildly entertained, hence a slightly above average score of 6. It could have been more. Still worth a view. But just as I said... ""to tickle your imagination""",Innerspace
82,lcpierce2011-969-896169,Still One of the Most Entertaining Movie Today,8,15 June 2014,"I'd almost forgot I had this movie. I've watched it maybe 30 times or more. I still love every second of this movie. It's one of those Spielberg movies that you can't get out of your head. It just won't leave. This particular movie was hard to find, but I prevailed. The intense acting of Dennis Quaid, and Martin Short says it all. They keep you going with each quirk of energy they generate. Very well done movie. Some movies, you just go to sleep, but not this one. I guard my DVD like a hawk. I will treasure this movie just like I do my ""Back To The Future Trilogy"" collection. The same as, ""Batteries Not Included"", Inner Space is a Jewel of a movie that will never fizzle out with time. Time is on it's side. Meg Ryan just put the icing on the cake. Beauty, poise and great acting on her part. Meg put the right twist on the movie to give a tender, affectionate side. All the cast did a bang up job.",Innerspace
83,dalben,A very funny and exciting adventure!,9,1 January 1999,"What a funny thrill ride this movie is!  A man (Dennis Quaid) volunteers to be shrunk down to the size of a cell and injected into a rabbit. But terrorists are after this scientific breakthrough and by various hijinks he winds up being injected into the butt of a nervous grocery clerk, played by Martin Short.  And that's just the beginning.Innerspace shows Dennis Quaid at his most winning, and Short at his funniest.  And of course, there's a very young Meg Ryan as their love interest.  The jokes resonate with both kids and adults, and unlike most action-adventure films, the plot here is never short of ideas.  And the effects are pretty neat too: as we see Quaid's character wander within the human body, we feel as much amazement and wonder as he does.  LOTS of movies attempt to put you in outer space and worlds far away, but I can't think of one that has made the creative attempt of exploring our inner space.I first saw ""Innerspace"" when I was 11.  I didn't know who any of the lead actors were.  I'd never seen Saturday Night Live.  And I thought it was a great movie.  Twelve years and hundreds of movies later, I still think it's wonderful.",Innerspace
84,rob_terminatorbestfilmin80s,Amazingly good dodgy 80's dance music!!!,1,12 May 2002,"Oh my god, the 80's Dance music is REALLY bad! Please don't watch this film for your own good!!! Meg Ryan is very fit, but this is the only advantage this apawling movie has to offer. There is no way Dennis Quaid make up for the lack of descent actors, the others are like puppets.",Innerspace
85,Blue Raven,"Fascinating, Funny, and Fantastic!!!",9,28 September 2001,"A Navy pilot, Tuck Pendelton, (Dennis Quaid) has been chosen for a secret experiment to operate a pod-like craft that is miniturized smaller than a grain of salt to be injected into a laboratory rabbit. However, the experiment goes haywire, and a bad batch of dudes want to take over the Miniturization all together. After stealing a microchip that is required for the process, one of the scientists injects the pod into the hypochondriac Safeway employee, Jack Putter. (Martin Short)Unfortunately, the one chip they've taken is useless without the other, which is inside the pod--which is inside Jack Putter!Now Pendelton, his beautiful ex-girlfriend, Lydia, (Meg Ryan) and Putter, have to work together to get the other chip back, and re-enlarge the pod before Tuck runs out of oxygen.This is one of my absolute favorite movies!I love all of the comedy that fits perfectly with the plot, the stunning special effects of all the close-up views of the human body, and romantic twists that suits the movie as well.I highly recommend this film for science-fiction, comedy, action, and romance movie fans....So this movie will most likely suit anyone!
If you haven't seen this, it's a MUST to rent or buy. Very exciting, delighting, and fun!You wont regret watching it! :)",Innerspace
