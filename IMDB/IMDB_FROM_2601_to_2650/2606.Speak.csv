0,SnoopyStyle,Stewart terrific in better-than-most Lifetime movie,7,31 May 2015,"It's the first day of school and Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart) arrives as a quiet depressed loner. Her old friends like Rachel (Hallee Hirsh) have abandoned her. There was a traumatic event at a summer party that is shown in recurring flashbacks and she is haunted by Andy Evans. She bullied as the Squealor. The only girl talking to her now is peppy new girl Heather. Mr. Neck is the intolerant teacher. Mr. Freeman (Steve Zahn) is her kind art teacher. Her parents (Elizabeth Perkins, D.B. Sweeney) are clueless. Agitator Dave Petrakis is assigned to be her lab partner.Kristen Stewart is terrific. She makes this not just simply another Lifetime TV teen rape drama. I love the title which is almost a plead for Melinda to speak up. It's the constant refrain at the back of my head throughout this movie. It creates intensity as the audience roots for her to speak up. A couple scenes do hold it back a little. Mr. Neck is pushed too far in one scene where he's almost a cartoon villain. I also think Melinda was a bit too mean to Heather in that one scene. Heather wasn't wrong when she tells her to talk to a professional. She also stuck with her a lot longer than most people would. Other than talking too much, she seems to be a good friend. Also a couple of times, the movie takes on too light of a tone. Overall, this is a compelling teen movie with a great central performance.",Speak
1,claudio_carvalho,Heartbreaking Coming-to-age Story,8,15 September 2006,"The teenager Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart) joins the high-school with a great feeling of rejection and becomes practically mute. Her school mates and friends call her ""squealer"", because she called the police during a summer party; she does not have communication with her mother, Joyce Sordino (Elizabeth Perkins), who is workaholic and is permanently busy; and she has problem with a very radical teacher. She finds a great support with her arts teacher Mr. Freeman (Steve Zahn) and her school friend David Petrakis (Michael Angarano), and recalls her traumatic experience in the summer school, when she was raped, learning how to deal with the situation and reborn mature.""Speak"" is a very simple and linear story, and even in the trailer the predictable trauma of Melinda is disclosed; therefore there are no surprises, plot point or mystery to have a twist in the story. What makes ""Speak"" a little gem and so special are the realistic story, the excellent direction and the stunning performances, mainly of Kristen Stewart in the role of the traumatized Melinda, learning how to deal with her rape and later rejection by the mates by herself. Steve Zahn is also great in a mature role (I believe this is the first time I see him in this type of character) of a supportive school teacher. The nominations and award of the sensitive director Jessica Sharzer are very fair, but I believe Kristen Stewart deserved also a nomination for her brilliant and awesome performance. I would like to recommend this movie for parents of teenagers. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Silêncio de Melinda"" (""The Silence of Melinda"")",Speak
2,kosmasp,Silence,7,30 September 2020,"It is not always easy to speak out or to tell ones story. Especially when it is one, that goes contrary to something or someone popular. While I usually don't read what movies are about, I had a glimpse at the summary, which was quite spoiler heavy. Because while you will figure out what ""bugs"" Kristen Stewarts character in this, it is worth going that journey with her, not knowing.So while the movie is more than decent more of the time, towards the end a couple of cliches do find their way in. Still a powerful movie, with a powerful, while very subtle main performance. And almost an audition tape for the Twilight movies (her character here is more fleshed out, if you'll excuse the pun). The theme of the movie is not one that is about feel good, this is a drama after all, but hopefully you can take something away from this. And hopefully the notion of things happening here, will be just a thing of the past ...",Speak
3,edwagreen,Speak: A Well Spoken Word ***1/2,9,29 June 2010,"An outstanding film featuring a remarkable performance by Kristen Stewart as a sullen, very depressed young lady in a high school. It was quite obvious that this girl needed help.The supporting performances are also quite good. We have an English teacher who looks like she came from the era of the Salem Witch Trials. Mr. Neck, a history teacher, beyond belief in cruelty. It was as if he smelled the vulnerability of Ms. Sordino (Kristen)and took full advantage of it. The one person the girl finds solace with is the art teacher, a free-spirited young man who allows the girl to express her feelings through drawing.This is an above average film that deals with a teenager in crisis and how those around her respond or don't.",Speak
4,jotix100,Silence,8,5 October 2005,"Finally an intelligent film about teen agers. The fascinating novel by Laurie Halse Anderson comes to the screen adapted by the director herself, Jessica Sharzer. The film merits to be seen by a wide audience because it tackles a lot of problems young people, especially young girls. Parents should see this movie because it will be an eye opener for many.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.Melinda Sordino is a wounded young woman. In flashbacks we see her as a happy and social teen ager, in sharp contrast with the taciturn and lonely girl we watch boarding the bus to go to school as the film begins. In flashbacks one gets to know the trauma that Melinda has gone through. All her bitterness is kept hidden inside her, as she won't talk about it, much less tell her distant parents what made her change.Melinda is a loner by necessity. Her former best friends turned against her because she called the police when the party, that proved to be the turning point in her life, gets out of hand. As a result, Melinda is ridiculed by her peers. ""Speak"" deals with the complex problems young people have to face on a daily basis in school, a place that should be a place of learning instead of a place that causes most problems among the young people, as Laurie Halse Anderson points out in her novel.The only kind soul Melinda encounters is the art teacher Mr. Freeman. He is a man that doesn't adhere to conventions and seems to be a rebel himself. With his encouragement, Melinda begins to draw and sketch pieces that are crude and devoid of life, but in them, she shows a talent to be a good artist under the right circumstances.Melinda realizes she must come out of the state that is affecting her life by confronting Rachel with the truth, something the other girl is not ready to accept since she is too emotionally involved with the young man that caused Melinda's trauma. The result is a changed Melinda, who suddenly realizes she must confess everything to her parents and go on with her life.The film owes a lot to Kristen Stewart, who as Melinda projects all the emotions bottled up in this young woman. Ms. Stewart appears to be a natural performer who can express all what she is feeling by her expressions. Steve Zahn is seen as the understanding teacher who sees all the potential in Melinda and is instrumental in giving her the confidence she should have. Elizabeth Perkins and D.B. Sweeney are Melinda's parents who should have seen what's wrong with her from the start, but being so involved with their lives, don't pay attention to their suffering daughter.Jessica Sharzer shows a potential for going far as a director because she shows a sensitivity rarely seen these days in serious movies dealing with wounded souls like Melinda Sordino.",Speak
5,morrison-dylan-fan,Speaking up.,10,29 May 2011,"With having (in 2002) just recovered from a pretty bad cold,I had a strong feeling that one of the things which I wanted to do first was to hang out with my friend again.With (at last) feeling well enough to go out,one of my friends suggested that we could go and watch a film.When we got to the box office,we found out that the cinema had just one more showing for the night,of a film called Panic Room.Due to that being the only option available,me and my friend decided to go for the film.Whilst watching the film (which now,seems to have sadly been mostly forgotten) I was very intrigued by the actress who played the daughter to Jodie Fosters lead character.Ocasionaly,every so often,I would check my local DVD rental store,to see if the girl (whose name I later found out is Kristen Stewart) had appeared in any other movies...Suddenly at some point in 2007 I began to hear that Stewart was going to make a bit of a come back that year by,co-starring in the Sean Penn film Into the Wild,and also having the lead role in an adaptation of a book which I had been hearing called Twilight.After Twilightmania had turned her into one of the main stars of a mega-hit franchise,I was interested in seeing how she would perform as Joan Jett in the Rock N Roll film The Runaways.From about the first five minutes of the very entertaining film ,I was very impressed with how good Stewarts performance was,and how well she captured the look of Jett.Around two or three weeks ago,I was chatting to a friend about how much I had enjoyed Runaways,and I was given a surprising reply,that if I enjoyed her work in that,then I really needed to see an indie film she had made,which has never come out in the UK.The Plot:With her parents and teachers hoping that Melinda Sordino can continue to keep getting the grades which she has been achieving,Melinda knows that everyone is expecting her to achieve ""big things"" in her Freshman year. Sadly just before the start of the new term,all of her friends,announce that they don't want to be friends with her any longer.This is due to Sordino being labelled a ""squealer"",after ruining the end of term party by calling up the cops for no reason at all (although the real reason Sordino phoned for the police-which, she has never told her family or friends about,was because she was brutally raped.) Due to (understandabre) still suffering from having been raped Melinda, becomes an ""outsider"" in her school,with most of the time she spends there, Melinda does not talk to anyone at all,and keeps herself as far away from other students as possible,mainly by spending her school time in the school storage room.Thankfully for Sordino,she gets an unexpected sign of light in her life from her art teacher Mr Freeman,who challenges Melinda to do art projects for the whole school year,which are based around tress.Slowly but surely,Sordino starts to let (a little bit) of her held feelings be shown in her art work,which gets Freeman to try and get Melina out of her shell.With having gained some of her confidence back,Melinda confidence gets badly damaged,when she discovers that the man who raped her,is now trying to become the boyfriend of her former best friend.Fearing that the same thing could happen to her former friend,Sordino decides that she has to try and put the disturbing events behind her,so she can reveal to everyone what happened,before its too late.. View on the film:When I first heard about the films plot,my original fear was that the movie would fall into the easy trappings of being an over the top melodrama.Impressivly, under rated director Jessica Sharzer (who also co-wrote the excellent screenplay with Annie Young Frisbie) avoids all of the trappings and instead makes a stunning emotionally raw film.For the rape scenes Sharzer avoids the risk of turning it into an exploitation film,by focusing on the fear and terror that it is causing Sordino.Whilst the film does look at the effects of the rape,Shazer smartly makes the trouble that Melinda is having at school of being an ""outsider"" something that any man or woman who has gone through similar things can easily relate to.Sharzer also gives the film a fantastic rough round the edges feel by,having almost all of the colours washed out,and giving the films look,a beautiful rough,fuzzy appearance.Looking for information about the film,I was stunned to discover that Kristen Stewart was only 13 when she starred in this film!.Unlike most actresses of that age,who would have either turned the character into a complete nervous wreck,or someone that has a huge chip on their shoulder at school.Stewart,instead gives a fantastic,surprisingly subtle performance,with Melinda at first being shown to be very scared about speaking up to anyone,or talking about anything.But as Mr Freeman (Steve Zahn,who I feel may have given the best performance that I have seen him do) starts to get Melinda to open up,Stewart shows Sordino gradually change into someone that feels they can at last open their mouth and speak. Final View on the film:A beautifully raw film,with an amazing screenplay,very classy directing from the sadly under used Sharzer and astonishing performances from the brilliant cast.",Speak
6,Sylviastel,Kristen's Acting Shines Here!,8,23 April 2011,"Kristen Stewart is the star here based on the novel of the same name by Laurie Halse Anderson. The story is about a teenager with a secret. She returns to another school year completely changed from a summertime experience. Steve Zahn plays her art teacher. She is suddenly the outcast and girl nobody wants to be around. She is pretty much friendless and alone. The story slowly evolves the process of her trauma in slow flashbacks. Don't worry, nothing too graphic here. The movie is aimed for a young audience and it was probably a television movie in the first place. The acting is fine with Stewart's performance in the leading role. The production value is decent. The cast includes some well-known actors and actresses but nobody really stands out. I have to say that Leslie Lyles who plays the hair lady teacher does a fine job. She's somebody to watch out for in the future.",Speak
7,deloudelouvain,"Adolescents are most of the time annoying, no exception in this movie.",6,9 September 2020,"For once I read a lot of positive reviews and this time I don't really agree with them. Don't get me wrong, Speak is worth a watch but it's for sure not a masterpiece like another reviewer stated. It's one of those movies you watch without too much interest, but it's watchable so you just get on with it. First of all teenagers are not the most interesting people to watch, most annoying on the other hand I could agree. The story is a bit slow and to be honest not that captivating or even interesting. Kristen Stewart isn't bad but she will never be a super actress either. Most of the cast are teenagers and most of them have annoying characters. Let's just say it's not my kind of genre of movies that I enjoy watching.",Speak
8,callanvass,Speak is an Unheralded masterpiece. You'll fall in love with Kristen Stewart.,10,10 January 2010,"I'll admit this now. I absolutely adore Kristen Stewart. I think she's one of the most uniquely beautiful woman in the world, with so much more about her, then Twilight. I unfortunately hadn't been able to get a copy of Speak, I couldn't seem to be able to find it anywhere. Thanks to an online movie watching site, I managed to find this gem. I can honestly say, Speak is a film, that toyed with my emotions, like no other film has done in some time. This is very much like my high school was. Full of bullying, teasing, and people hurting others. And it made me feel ashamed of myself, because I actually teased a couple people, like a couple of the characters did here to Melinda. The concept of the story is very simple, yet done so effectively. The film weighs heavily on Kristen Stewart's shoulders, and for her age, that's a daring task, and thankfully she's fully up for it. Jessica Sharzer does an excellent job of developing Melinda. Making sure us as the viewers, go through the emotions with Melinda, and Jessica makes us want to jump into the T.V screen and comfort her, help protect her so to speak.The flashback scenes to Melinda's horrific summer, are very well handled. I'm very picky on flashback scenes, so I was happy they put a lot of effort to them. If your even slightly emotional, the ending will have you clapping in joy, or all wrapped up emotionally, possibly both, because after all that torture she goes through, it all finally pays off in the end. This is an apparently made for T.V movie. I can honestly say I have never, ever seen such an amazingly effective, t.v movie like this one. It's so polished ,and handled so well, it feels like the real deal. I don't wanna say much more, other than I suggest you check this one out for yourself. If you hated Kristen due to all her Twilight exposure, and feel she can't act, I suggest you pay this movie a visit. It will make you think twice about her talent, I assure you.Performances. Kristen Stewart is Oscar worthy here in my opinion. She has all the right emotional tunes, down to a T. We go through every emotion she is going through, every bit of pain she suffers, we honestly feel. For a kid her age at this time, it's truly an extraordinary performance she gave, and the likability she is able to produce is astonishing, it truly is. Performances don't get much better then the one Kristen gives us, as Melinda. Michael Angarano is pretty good as the outspoken friend. He isn't on-screen as much as you may think, but he has a very important character. Eric Lively is a real sleaze ball as Andy. When you see what he does in the flashback scenes, you'll hate him instantly. He was excellent. Elizabeth Perkins is one of the most underrated character actresses out there. She plays a caring, yet naive mother, but was likable all the same. Steve Zahn plays a neat role as Mr.Freeman. He's one of the few people who actually gave a damn, about Melinda. Allison Siko is annoying as Heather. Her constant ditsy, drivel, will grate you.Bottom Line. Speak is an Unheralded masterpiece. It's a great detailed look about what a lot of High School's, are honestly like. It will drain your emotions, and it's pretty hard to watch at points. But Overall Speak is worth the entire experience, and It's simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.10/10",Speak
9,jadavix,"A small, tragically overlooked classic",8,11 September 2021,"Wow. This one really blind-sided me. I read the book when I was a teenager, but I never even knew there was a movie of it. Having just finished watching it, I think, if anything, the movie is better than the book.Kristen Stewart gives a typically wonderful, understated performance as the protagonist. I couldn't believe that she was only 14 when this was released. She seems so poised and in control. And this was not an easy role.I was also not expecting the rape scene to be depicted as realistically - read: distressingly - as it was. I think you should credit the film-makers for not shying away from that.The movie also has an emotionally devastating scene where Melinda realises she may not be able to ""speak"" about her experience, but she can write about it. Both these scenes had me holding back tears.""Speak"" appears to have had a lower budget, which is perhaps why it is not very well known. But you know what? Sometimes money up on the screen gets in the way. The fact that the movie was obviously filmed all on location only makes it more believable.Like Stewart's performance this movie is an understated classic. I loved her character, loved the character of the friend she makes played by Matthew Angarano, loved Steve Zahn's art teacher. More people should watch this movie to understand the crime of rape.",Speak
10,yusufpiskin,Sundance,8,7 April 2020,"I watched this movie late last year and it is the most thought-provoking and possibly the most realistic movie I have ever watched. I usually don't like sappy movies like this, but this is one of the few exceptions. I watched the trailer first before the movie and had no idea why the protagonist (played by Kristen Stewart) was so mute and unhappy, the trailer didn't give much away, which was a good thing and I was still intrigued by the trailer and wanted to watch the movie. A huge part of me wanted to watch this for Kristen Stewart, because I am such a huge fan of her. So I watched the full movie for free on YouTube and I loved it!Speak is such a great, serious, intense, realistic, very strongly acted, well-made, and thought-provoking film with relatable characters (mostly the main character Melinda being relatable, well, really to teenage girls who've been in similar situations to her). Kristen Stewart was wonderful in this film! Her acting was so incredible and authentic. She should have gotten nominated for and won a Golden Globe for her amazing acting in Speak. Kristen Stewart played a compelling and very relatable character who was an often quiet, nice teen girl in ninth grade who constantly looked like there was something big and bad on her mind and was a social outcast among everyone at her school.It was eventually revealed that she was raped by her boyfriend on a date night last summer after eighth grade. So that was what traumatized her and caused to lose the ability to speak. This movie showed me that being sexually assaulted can be very traumatic and be so traumatic that it can have long affect on you and make you extremely uncomfortable to speak. I honestly never knew that cause I have never experienced being raped before nor have ever committed a sexual assault. This movie did a fantastic job portraying that.",Speak
11,aimless-46,Kristen Stewart Should Have a Lot of Fans After This Performance,9,6 September 2005,"In my review a year ago of ""Catch That Kid"", I referred to Kristen Stewart as a young Portman/Knightley. Most people thought I was going a bit overboard but with her performance in ""Speak"" I feel even more confident of my assessment. Although ""Speak"" was shot within a few months of ""Catch That Kid"" Stewart looks considerably older, with the Portman/Knightley connection even more obvious. Her understated performance as Melinda Sordino is absolutely riveting. Stewart's performance is critical to this film because she is not just the central character but also the narrator, the entire story is told from her point of view.Cinematographer Andrij Parekh gets maximum effect from the camera as the film is filled with tight shots of Stewart's face and eyes. Director Jesseca Sharzer gets an incredible non-verbal performance from Stewart which is nicely offset by the voice-over narration. Like the narration in ""The Opposite of Sex"" and ""Girl"" this helps relieve the intensity and introduces some wry humor into the story. I particularly liked Stewart's offhand voice-over on her way to the principal's office: ""I forgot that the suffragettes were hauled off to jail, duh"".Melinda's flat and distanced narration is often contradicted by the crushing emotional trauma she is experiencing on the screen, this dichotomy is a very effective way to illustrate her inner strength and multi-dimensionality.Parekh complements his close work with interesting short focal transitions and some good exterior shots. One especially nice one is when Stewart is walking in the distance and the focus slowly changes to highlight a bee and a flower in the foreground.Like ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", the adult roles are a bit extreme but the student roles are very convincing. Interestingly, the climatic scene actually occurs about 15 minutes before the ending. Melinda's rejuvenation happens during her impromptu hospital visit, her voice-over reflects this change: ""It happened. There's no avoiding it. No forgetting."" Strong again she dumps Heather, plays a killer set of tennis, and bicycles to the scene of last summer's party where she confronts what happened to her and decides to tell Rachel. The tree that inspired her painting helps tie everything together.Virtually everyone should find this film engrossing, but it will especially appeal to those who like to see their heroines get stronger as a story progresses.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.NOTES ON THE ADAPTATION: A personal visualization process occurs when reading a book that often makes its movie adaptation less powerful and less enjoyable. But it also affords the opportunity to focus on understanding why the screenwriter, director, and editor choose to use, alter, or omit each element in the book. Adaptations are all about economy and efficiency as they try to tell the same essential story visually and often symbolically.In the case of ""Speak"", I think the movie is more powerful than the book as you feel Melinda's trauma more, even if you don't understand it as precisely. The visuals of Melinda's emotional battles are more powerful than any narrative; as are the visuals of her drawings and of the process of her growing stronger as the story progresses.The adaptation shows Melinda's parents more positively but still portrays them as disinterested. The key scene is Christmas morning. Watch how after receiving the art supplies Melinda is pleasantly stunned that her parents were actually aware that she was drawing, then quickly disappointed when they disconnect and start their own conversation about the stereo system, which brings on the flashback of them not being there when she returned home from the party.They wonderfully condense the process of Mr. Freeman connecting with Melinda, the key scene is when he and Ivy are discussing her art project with the turkey bones and the palm tree. Melinda is seated as they come into the frame from both sides. The camera is static as they discuss the project until just before Mr. Freeman says the word ""pain"". At that point they cut to a tight reaction shot of Melinda's face as the word registers and her eyes look up at him in surprise. With that short sequence they manage to communicate about 50 pages of narrative and to say all that is needed about the special relationship that Melinda and Mr. Freeman will develop. The viewer is shown not just that he is picking up her pain from the symbolism in her art work, but more importantly that she now realizes there is someone who is tuned in and interested in her welfare. This little sequence is truly inspired and a great illustration of the visual power of film.",Speak
12,saadgkhan,Interesting & Unusual tale with Remarkable Kristen Stewart,5,19 January 2011,"SPEAK – CATCH IT ( B- ) The Concept of the movie is quite interesting and unusual. The whole movie proceeds very beautifully and does create the curiosity about ""what exactly happened in past to Kristen Stewart's Character"". The Flashbacks of the character were nicely incorporated in movie. Though, the second half the movie was little dry plus I wanted to see more of Kristen Stewart & Michael Angarano. Kirsten Stewart did a fantastic job as she does in her every Independent movie. Michael Angarano has few scenes but he Impress me a lot. Eric Lively is Gorgeous as her sister Blake Lively.

14,hnt_dnl,"Honest, provocative drama with a stellar performance from Kristen Stewart",9,5 March 2011,"I actually first saw SPEAK (2004) a few years ago right after it came out when NO ONE knew who Kristen Stewart was! My first impression was that I had just seen a provocative film about teen date rape and the young lead actress gave a sterling performance. Having seen it a couple of times since, I'm even more impressed with how good the movie is overall! On the surface, it seems like one of the dime-a-dozen movie-of-the-weeks from YEARS ago, but it is much more than that.I can't help but make a comparison/contrast between this film and THE ACCUSED (the Jodie Foster film from 1988 for which she won her first Oscar). I honestly have always thought that Foster's performance in that movie was heavily overrated and it is a hard film to watch, but for all the wrong reasons with it's by-the-numbers storyline of the victim fighting back, predictable courtroom scenes, and that overdone climactic flashback of the rape itself.SPEAK goes for the less-is-more approach and instead of Stewart's character Melinda Sordino going the histrionic route, she instead hides the fact that she was sexually assaulted and goes into a shell for the better part of a year, only speaking when spoken to (and sometimes not even then!). During this time, Melinda derives ridicule from her former friends and most of the school because the night of the rape at an end-of-summer party, she called the 911, leading to a police raid of the teen party of under aged drinkers, some of whom got busted; but because of Melinda's secrecy about the call, everyone just thinks she's weird and don't know the real reason for her actions.During Melinda's following year in high school, four important relationships develop for Melinda: (1) a new student Heather (fine work by Alison Siko) that befriends her and is completely oblivious to the situation; Heather represents total teen bliss and ignorance and can't even begin to comprehend Melinda's plight, (2) history teacher Mr. Neck (played with stern confidence by Robert John Burke); Neck is the ""establishment"", uncaring of Melinda's personal turmoil and is all about following the rules, (3) outspoken outsider student Dave (played with aplomb and appeal by Michael Angarano), represents an atypical male teen that is not obsessed with sex or cliques and has drive and ambition, and (4) art teacher Mr. Freeman (Steven Zahn in a typically fine performance); Freeman is the new, young teacher that can related closer to the students than his colleagues; he is the rebel that refuses to conform to societal constraints.Navigating her way through these new relationships as well as dealing with her well-intentioned, yet oblivious parents, a domineering and somewhat selfish mother (excellently portrayed by Elizabeth Perkins) and well-meaning, yet rather clueless father (solid D.B. Sweeney) somehow gives Melinda an inner resolve and strength by year's end. Somehow, SPEAK avoids many clichés and sheds an honest, informative, yet engrossing light into a very sensitive subject. None of the characters come off as clichés.All the more impressive about Stewart's work is that she was actually a TEEN when she did this film. Too bad it went unnoticed by the Academy. Not surprised, though. They wouldn't know a real honest film or performance if it bit them in the butt! She may have played an almost-mute character, but Stewart's work speaks volumes (pardon the pun) about her talent!",Speak
15,jpschapira,Sometimes there just comes a great movie...,9,10 January 2011,"It might be the effect of watching a lot of bad films in a row but the truth remains: sometimes there just comes a great movie. Jesssica Sharzer's ""Speak"" is one of those pictures that gets everything right. Like ""Thirteen"" or ""The virgin suicides"", it chooses characters, explores their environment and takes care of covering every aspect of a heartbreaking story. A heartbreaking story told, shot with respect is not the only thing these films have in common. The most important characters are girls, and the writer/directors are women. This can't be a coincidence. However, what changes is the point of view. Where ""The virgin suicides"" was seen through the eyes of boys and ""Thirteen"" was a whole new (extreme at times) experience for a high school girl, ""Speak"" takes a step back. It's a humbler movie; neither entirely poetic nor filled with the emotions its main character is desperate to express.Melinda (Kristen Stewart) has done something terrible and is starting the new school year without friends. She wants her friends back, but something else happened and it's making very difficult for her to walk calmly around the hallways. There is a reconstruction of events, poetically narrated, which includes images that represent the bliss of adolescence and its biggest fears at the same time. The music, a fantastic score by Christopher Libertino, works perfectly when we witness the past and also Melinda's everyday life. When her mother (Elizabeth Perkins) wakes her up and she's screaming, she says: ""Don't worry, the boogeyman is gone"". Melinda knows this is not true. She walks around with ghosts and talks only when necessary. We have the privilege of listening to her thoughts, but the movie title is precise about it: Melinda can't speak up.""Speak"" gets everything right because Sharzer keeps it real. It's an important detail in films like these that things don't get out of hand. Disbelief may cause distraction, but here the camera is not flashy, the dialogue is not excessive, the key moments are not over dramatized; the economy of resources in general is astounding and seems intentional. What we know about the multiple characters is from what Melinda thinks of them in particular moments or what she directly says to them in important situations. The rest we have to figure out for ourselves (specially the relationship of Melinda with her parents, also an important detail in movies like this one). The movie never explains or anticipates too much because its story depends on what we find as we watch it. Proof of this fact is the most outspoken character, and art teacher played by Steve Zahn, who has a typical bohemian/philosophic/life lesson intended speech that for any viewer may sound like bullshit. Art plays a big part in ""Speak"", but it's not due to the art teacher's words It's simply because of the direct relationship Melinda experiences with art and how it widely affects her; a relationship mainly generated by the art teacher.Kristen Stewart is amazing. The depressive look on her face she has completely mastered finds its inception in ""Speak"". High school, lack of satisfaction, quirkiness that is sexy, a world of questions inside a world of unresolved problems and, in the end, some kind of kindness. You could say by now that she's typecast, but if I didn't say it before I dare anyone to find any other actress who can do it better. The close-ups of Stewart here are plenty and I find it hard to write (this means 'try to explain') how two eyes that seem lost in the middle of nowhere can transmit so much. I've already praised Stewart so. I'm a bit tired. Go and watch it for yourselves.""Speak"" is a fabulous experience, though not the happiest. You don't imagine how good it feels when a movie understands that there's nothing more left to show; that the story has been told and the screen needs to go black. I envy the way this film resolves its ending, when nothing else can be said. And don't forget the movie's called ""Speak"".",Speak
16,socrates4,Not Bad,7,19 January 2019,"SPEAK is an interesting character drama starring Kristen Stewart as a young girl with selective mutism. In other words she has chosen not to speak. It is an intriguing story, bleak at times, as we learn about this person and the world in which she lives.Stewart gives perhaps the best performance of her career here. I admit I have not seen all of her work, but this film made a true fan out of me and now I want to see more. Recommend.",Speak
17,nightroses,Talking is hard,6,10 May 2018,"This film is well made and colouful, with close-ups of facial expressions. It's also sad to watch because rap is very serious and traumatic. Talking is very difficult and things go wrong. The main character is played by Kristen Stewart who finds school difficult. Her grades fall, she's lost her friends, she's picked on and there's a guy at school who raped her in the previous year. She can barely cope with all the school stuff, and then being targetted by one of the teachers giving her low grades. The symbolism in the movie is with trees and it may be her inner strength that she wants to find using art.",Speak
18,nicolechan916,A well made film that made the story real.,8,18 December 2014,"This film encompasses the essence of high school life, and though not all high schools are like this, it was generalized without being overly stereotypic. I like how simplistic this film is, and how they showed the series of events by juxtaposing the present with bits of the past. The title itself, ""Speak"" is so direct and just hits the mark. Personally, I like one word titles.The acting was great too. We all know of the bashing Kristen Stewart gets from people for her stoic acting (and to be honest I myself have commented on it), but it works great for her character. The rest of the cast was good too, though I don't get what the character Mr. Neck (Robert John Burke) was all about. He acted prejudiced in the beginning of the film and I thought maybe he was joking, but he wasn't, which just made me think that he was a horrible teacher.Another thing that felt a bit off to me, was her hiding spot in the school. It seems to be a janitor room but no-one finds her there and she just claims the space.The directing, editing and screenplay enhanced the story of the film and made it very raw. They did a good job of bringing it to life and it felt real. This isn't an easy topic to handle and though the movie did not have the dark almost ominous feel that some have when this topic is involved, it showed how an ordinary high school girl might experience it. This was based on a book of the same name by Laurie Halse Anderson, and I'm not sure how closely it followed it, but the film was pretty well done.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Speak

I'm not a fan of Kristen Steward, but she was well-suited for the role. I would even go as far as to say that it is her performance that ""carries"" the movie.I haven't read the book, so I'm just judging this as a stand-alone movie, and, as such, it's not half as bad I thought it was going to be. Maybe it's because my expectations weren't very high to begin with...I do, however, believe that the current IMDb rating of 7.8 is just ridiculous. This movie deserves a solid 6.0, but not over that, honestly.A good movie. Definitely worth watching, but a bit overrated if you ask me.",Speak

Melinda and her parents start off as distant, but then I realized that both her mum and dad were pretty cool. So was Melinda, but I guess they all three just needed to figure some things out. Especially Melinda, because she has a big secret. It tears away at her. I also liked Melinda's friends. Both her x-friends from last school year and her new ones. Although Rachel comes off as a little bitchy at first. The one person I didn't like was Andy. But he is the bad guy, so that's the way it should be. Oh, Mr. Neck is a bit over the top as the teacher who breathes down their necks when they are two minutes late or if they have opinions of their own.I am a teacher, and maybe I could appreciate easier some of the stereotyped characters at the school.

The film spans an entire year, but flashbacks of the said event at the end of 8th grade appear a few times throughout the film.You must have patience in order to enjoy this film.

Kudos to these filmmakers for raising the bar on made-for-TV pics! The drama of high school is effective without repeated clichés and the parenting is not flat, white or black, either. Told mostly through flashback as a girl wrestles with her pain and how to press through, the story is interesting without confusion. Many quality film techniques make this a rare feature. While presenting a clear message as usual in this genre, the writer, director and actors avoid many of the typical categories and resolutions without compromising characters. Believable and really outstanding work. I hope these filmmakers make a lot more such features.",Speak

Virginity is something special, to be given away only once. Rape assaults a person in every way. Not often acknowledged is that men/boys can and do get sexually assaulted. This movie is for everyone! It addresses all the feelings and consequences. It addresses the misunderstandings and the subsequent fall-outs. It addresses matters from both sides of the fence. It shows that the victims are not just the ones raped but the family and friends who just don't know what's going on and why. The performances were very strong, especially by Kristen Stewart. The flashbacks were most effective. In time victims can learn to live with it but it is never truly gone, memories are there and can be triggered by a smell, touch, taste and texture.

28,vocklabruck,I loved Melinda so much!,8,29 September 2007,"I admit I was wary about this film because it started as a typical made-for-teens movie in the school and stuff. So at first I thought I was watching a Beverly Hills 90210 episode, but since I love Kristen Stewart I kept watching and I am glad I did. The movie was very touching.Some parts reminded me Carry by Brian De Palma, for example when the school director confused Melinda's name. Maybe it was a kind of homage? Kristen Stewart's acting was superb and made me love her character. I think only good actresses/actors can do that with the audience. Her acting is probably the 90% of this movie. It's a sad film but not as depressing as I had thought: Sometimes the Melinda's narration and the music lifts you.This movie has a message about the rape, its effects on a girl and why is so important to talk, but there is another message also: There are so much people immersed in their own worlds who just ignore others or never have a friendly word and only say ""He/She is a freak"" while actually that ""freak"" is the person who needs help so badly. And I am not talking about Melinda only. I mean, it is also sad that most girls (like the ones in the movie) are prone to ignore hearts of gold like David (the only Melinda's supporter) and go after the Andy (the jerk) model instead, not knowing that the handsome one could be the most worthless person around.",Speak

30,trixie-k-88,Heartfelt and touching,10,6 March 2012,"Speak is the movie that gave the illusion Kristen Stewart was a good actress. It is a poignant and look at a traumatized girl with elective mutism.Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart) is a normal, happy fourteen-year-old about to start high school. But one night at a party something horrible happens to her, and she calls 911 to ask for help. Unable to find her voice, she hangs up and the police come to the address and bust the party. The already traumatized Melinda is labeled a ""Squealer"" and loses all her friends, becoming a pariah as she enters high school. In light of the painful event and the fact that everyone hates her, Melinda decides to stop talking. While her parents (Elizabeth Perkins & D.B. Sweeney) seem oblivious to her depression and withdrawal, Melinda finds solace in her caring art teacher Mr. Freeman (Steve Zahn) and outspoken classmate Dave Petrakis (Michael Angarano). Through her year long assignment of drawing trees, Melinda tries to heal from what happened and speak again, while slowly revealing to the audience what changed her life.The story is solid, and it was a very good adaption of the novel. The book put a lot of focus on Melinda's artwork, and it is even more powerful to see it on screen. Kristen Stewart performs well in this film, probably because her flat affect and often blank expressions fit so well with the character. She does well with the few lines within the film itself, and an even better job of narrating it. Kristen narrates with an air of pained dissociation, which rings very true for anyone who has or works with people suffering with Post-Traumatic Stress. There is also a heartfelt performance by Steve Zahn, as the only adult who reaches out to Melinda and gives her exactly what she needs—a tool to process her emotions. So good it will make you overlook the Twilight series!",Speak
31,woinaroschy_1979,"Pretty good, solid acting and directing, plot has a few stumbling points",8,17 December 2010,"This movie totally changed my opinion about Kristen Stewart...whom I know from the Twilight saga movies and The Messengers. In the aforementioned movies I was not very impressed by her acting (Twilight raised perhaps a bit above the rest), even downright disappointed and completely angered by the constant confused look and gaping mouth (please please try to shut your mouth, you look like some handicapped child, or like you have so big teeth you can't close it more than that, it's not at all SEXY!). But here she's brilliant, without overdoing it, and her vulnerability is almost palpable. The movie is well directed, I loved all the little details of high school life (like ""Gym should be illegal"" or ""My English teacher has no face"" or career day ""Are you a giver, a taker or a carer?""- I'm thankful I didn't have that when I was in school, putting you in a box like that, ""Brave new world"" isn't far away), the only stumbling point for me is that it is perhaps too long, drawing out on Melinda's feelings and inability to speak about what happened to her. And no one seems to care about her sudden and complete change, her mother is too busy, her father is too shy, her friends are mad at her but do not question why she did it...this was something I could not comprehend, because her best friend (they were best friends for 9 years) NEVER even asked her WHY she called the police, she just assumed it was out of spite or something. Or maybe they didn't show the scene? Maybe she asked Melinda and as usual Melinda didn't say a word? On the other hand, I know that people never give attention to those around them that are silent...if you don't speak up, people just ignore you and trample all over you (like that stupid new girl does with Melinda). Still there should be a few people that care about you and notice your change and that should try to make you spit it out. Maybe it's a good message to everyone to try and help those around you and not immediately treat them as freaks and ignore them. Sometimes it's very difficult to speak up...and the ability to just listen to people is becoming a unique gift. People don't have time to listen, they prefer to advise you to seek ""professional help"". Really good movie, with a strong message! Bravo Kristen! I won't judge you based on Twilight movies anymore.",Speak
32,Filmcritic624,Not your typical teen movie,8,6 September 2005,"This finally aired on Lifetime yesterday, and since I was such a big fan of Laurie Halse Anderson's novel, I might as well wanted to see the movie to compare them.The first few minutes of the movie turned out to be exactly pages from the book, as well as some emotional moments that almost reduced me to tears, showed exactly the way she was feeling, and how she was connected from the moment to the school year in such depressive, mute fashion that she manages to handle so well. The story involves a teenage girl who, after calling the cops to bust a wrecked summer party, comes to acknowledge her peers won't talk to her anymore. So, what do you do when times like these come to happen? Stay silent, don't get noticed by anyone. However, there was something at the party that she doesn't want people to know, and if she tells it, it will rip and shed her into pieces. Now, your probably asking yourself? Why wouldn't you talk to your parents? She would, only that her mom (Elizabeth Perkins) and dad (D.B. Sweeney) are almost never home so that way they can talk to her about anything.As the movie goes on, Melinda (Kirsten Stewart) begins to lighten up around the surroundings. She starts to feel into her own, and the school year (besides the fact her grades went flushing down the toilet). Melinda starts to make friends little by little, as she connects with her eccentric Art teacher Mr. Freeman (Steve Zahn). The two of them exemplify what it means to try and go against what is asked of them, and go above that to raising the bar to a whole new level of education, and life.As for the acting, Stewart is extraordinary as the reclusive Melinda Sordino. She fits the feelings of a depressed girl, striving for help, and need from peers, not harmful words. She makes herself known around the school, as ""the girl who busted Kyle Rodgers's summer party"" and shows it around by the depressive acts (cutting (both class and self mutilation), making her own room, being practically mute). Stewart has the absolute potential to be another Lindsay Lohan, but in this case, she's become her own actress.The rest of the cast could have been better, but the second runner up is Steve Zahn, whose films could have seen better days, but this film is probably his best work, compared to ""Saving Silverman"" or ""Freak talks about Sex"". He should make films like these more often than not. His portrayal of the rebellious, journeyman Mr. Freeman tell the students about themselves, and tells a small anecdote about him. His overshadowing of the students make him sound more powerful than the principal himself, and his voice strengthen amongst the weaker ones.Powerful movie, I recommend this to anyone with teenagers, or any educational film. This is a worth to watch.8/10.",Speak
33,wordsmith_57,Listen to What's Not Being Said,8,4 January 2008,"Having read the book I immediately grabbed it off the shelf when I saw it as a DVD choice at the library. It's different somewhat in presentation from the book, yet it covers the main parts of the plot: Melinda's pain of being ostracized and misunderstood. Kirsten Stewart portrayed a wounded spirit very well. As an actress she reminds me of a young Jodie Foster with her tomboyish looks and intensity.Most high school movies come off as phony, due to the actors being so much older, or stereotypes being so evident. There is an authenticity about this film. The actors look and act like teenagers. The teachers are stereotyped, but this works for its purpose. Steve Zahn was the absolute perfect choice for the art teacher. Any scene he was in gave the film depth and richness.Overall, the film spoke to me about going beneath the surface when people I know change radically in personality. Something is not right, and if they can't talk about it, I need to listen and care. I hope this gets shown in theclassroom--it's powerful.",Speak

It deals with a very real yet very troubling issue, and handles it with sensitivity and hope.  This movie has the potential to really help people, and I can't think of a better legacy for a filmmaker.Despite all that, I wish this would have been a better movie.  The pacing of the story seemed wildly out of whack and there were a couple of directorial decisions that could certainly be questioned.  On the other hand, Kristen Stewart's performance in the lead role of Melinda was excellent, although the rest of the acting left me flat.  (Even Steve Zahn, who I normally love, seemed a bit miscast.)  And while the writing didn't grab me, there were enough light-hearted moments to make Melinda's personal anguish bearable for the audience.Beyond cinema as therapy, the film contained meaningful insights into the potential of artistic expression in healing, the general alienation of being a freshman in high school, or the critical relationship of an individual's will and determination with the healing process.

It is never easy to handle a story about a traumatizing event, but to do it with such sensitivity, in the midst of a HILARIOUS movie, is pure genius.  A great deal of the credit must go to Kristen Stewart for her  portrayal of a girl whose emotions are always known to the audience, though she hardly ever says a word.  Anyone who has been to high school should get a big kick from some of the send-ups in ""Speak.""

Stewart does a great job as the frightened unconfident Melinda and the narration from her is quirky, funny but also gives an insight of how the character actually feels. Zahn also does a great job as the funky art teacher trying to inspire his students and help Melinda regain her confidence. The direction of the film is steady and knows where it wants to head and finish and shows the harsh reality of highschool where cliques form and bullying thrives but i felt that Angarano and Zahn deserved more screen time because they were great.Positives: Great acting, good story and really pulls you into the film Negatives: Should've had more from the secondary characters Overall: Should definitely watch this film!!",Speak

I read the synopsis and it seemed like something I might enjoy, story-wise and cast-wise (big fan of Steve Zahn as well and was fairly impressed with Stewart's role in Panic Room). I decided to give it a shot and was glad I did, as it has given me quite a memorable movie experience.Melinda Sordino (Stewart) is a high school freshman, who was once a bright, happy student. One night a terrible event occurs that instantly changes that and simultaneously ostracizes her from her peers. School, is now a torment for her as she has no one to relate to or confide in (her parents (Sweeney & Elizabeth Perkins) are caring but unaware of her issue and oblivious to her). She regresses and rarely speaks to anyone, even to the few who try to reach out to her. One person does manage to break through, her new art teacher, Mr. Freeman (Zahn), who gets Melinda to slowly express her emotions through her art projects. She tries to regain the confidence to open back up and ultimately break free of the shell she has created for herself.This movie is definitely not a feel-good flick, but the screenplay (adapted from the same-titled book) affords some light moments (usually from Melinda's observations through her inner monologue and rare interactions in the classroom). Stewart is truly the revelation here as she perfectly nails the depressed and isolated role of Melinda and can deftly handle the couple of pretty harrowing incidents that occur. She is definitely one to watch for in the future. Zahn, usually cast for comedic parts, pulls off his best performance. The scene towards the end of the movie between Mr. Freeman and Melinda in her ""safe place"", was enough to bring me to tears, even though there were barely any words spoken. Just perfect.",Speak
46,alfiecycling,A poignant story of a teenage girl's ordeal and recovery.,10,24 November 2014,"Wow! I just found out that today, January 20, 2014 is the 10th year anniversary of the release of this fine movie by Showtime. I really love this movie and have watched it numerous times.The actress Kristen Stewart shines in it.The main character is a young teenage girl named Melinda Sordino. Sordino is Italian for "" mute,"" and Melinda can mean, among other things,a Linden tree. Ironically, the quasi ""mute"" Melinda is the very person doing all the narrating throughout the movie. A poignant story of a teenage girl's ordeal and recovery. Many other character's in the movie have similar type names, for example; Heather is a friend that unfriends Melinda because Melinda is too depressed. And Ivy who unfriends her because of a misunderstanding. In fact, Melinda refers to cliques as ""clans"" which is from the Latin for sprout.And the author Nathaniel Hawthorne is mentioned in her English class and Hawthorne is a hedge bush of the rose family.Hawthorne's book, The Scarlet Letter is mentioned as being full of symbolism.Which this story seems to also be full of.I can't figure out why the author,Laurie Hals Anderson, of Speak uses so many horticultural references.But interestingly enough,right after Melinda is sexually assaulted by Andy,who is a popular teen, Melinda stays in his Jeep Wrangler after he leaves her. She looks through the windshield as she's weeping and sees a large majestic tree. Is the tree a "" mute witness"" to the crime?"" We see the rape in a series of flashbacks by Melinda.Later on, when she begins her freshman year at Merryweather High, her lovable bohemian art teacher, Mr. Freeman, instructs the class to pick a slip of paper out of a damaged globe that will have their year long art project on it. Melinda picks one that has the word "" tree.""

The main lead's stoic face is perfect for this film. The story line is beautifully executed from the book. And the casts are good. Although the acting did not really reach me, the story makes up for it.",Speak
48,fotw,So teenage,3,20 December 2005,"If your like 12 and need a break from all those ""American Pie"" movies and avril lavigne CDs; if you want something real dramatic and tragic, something that provokes thoughts in your young head: well, my friend this is the one for you.OK, so the story in itself IS tragic, but that doesn't make the movie any better. It was the same old ""social outcast who's actually real hot"" routine. Ultimately it did explain why she had became one of those, which was pretty much the only good thing about this movie. It still sucked though. I literally found myself begging for it to end so i could go on with my life. yeah.",Speak
49,jasonay,Occasionally interesting TV movie,7,3 April 2006,"The first scene of this movie is the best: A young teen-ager stares into the mirror after an inventive makeup job that makes it look like her lips have been sewn shut. This image reflects the entire subject matter of the film - silence, repressed feelings and the inability to express emotions following a tragedy.One thing that is unique about Speak is that while most films about high school rape are about seniors, this is about freshmen, with the assault taking place in grade 8. Such things must happen, and even if it is less likely to happen at fourteen than in the later teen years it's still refreshing to see the subject addressed.Most of the acting is TV quality, although the narration was well done. I never had the feeling of an entire school year passing, despite efforts to show the seasons changing and various holidays passing by. Aside from the opening scene, nothing particularly grabbed my attention. This is a fairly standard TV movie with good intentions - and that's all it needs to be. It's an excellent film for any teen struggling to express their feelings about anything that's troubling them, whether it's rape or not.",Speak

I'd read the book when it came out and loved it, but wasn't sure how it would translate to film, given that the main character really doesn't talk at all in the book.  Jessica Sharzer's adaptation handles all of the potential problems beautifully, without changing the fundamental story and using voiceover only sparingly. What really makes the movie, though, is Kristen Stewart's complete embodiment of Melinda.  She does things with her face that actors twice her age with twice her experience only wish they could do.  Though the film is not at all didactic in nature, it would be a great one for teens to see with their parents.  Lots of good material for discussion.  It's great to see Laurie Halse Anderson's wonderful book get the screen treatment it deserves. If you like this movie, you might also like BLUE CAR, MANNY & LO, and THE CHOCOLATE WAR.",Speak

She was amazing in this movie, everyone is and you will cry at least a little. Between being such a young teenager and the emotions women experience at any age mix that with a new school year loosing and gaining friends-it's a lot. This movie was well written, acted, directed, and scored. If you've never experienced trauma or have I think this a good movie to watch.

I just found out that today, January 20, 2014 is the 10th year anniversary of the release of this fine movie by Showtime. I really love this movie and have watched it numerous times.The actress Kristen Stewart shines in it.The main character is a young teenage girl named Melinda Sordino. Sordino is Italian for "" mute,"" and Melinda can mean, among other things,a Linden tree. Ironically, the quasi ""mute"" Melinda is the very person doing all the narrating throughout the movie.Many other character's in the movie have similar type names, for example; Heather is a friend that unfriends Melinda because Melinda is too depressed. And Ivy who unfriends her because of a misunderstanding. In fact, Melinda refers to cliques as ""clans"" which is from the Latin for sprout.And the author Nathaniel Hawthorne is mentioned in her English class and Hawthorne is a hedge bush of the rose family.Hawthorne's book, The Scarlet Letter is mentioned as being full of symbolism.Which this story seems to also be full of.I can't figure out why the author,Laurie Hals Anderson, of Speak uses so many horticultural references.But interestingly enough,right after Melinda is sexually assaulted by Andy,who is a popular teen, Melinda stays in his Jeep Wrangler after he leaves her. She looks through the windshield as she's weeping and sees a large majestic tree. Is the tree a "" mute witness"" to the crime?"" We see the rape in a series of flashbacks by Melinda. Later on, when she begins her freshman year at Merryweather High, her lovable bohemian art teacher, Mr. Freeman, instructs the class to pick a slip of paper out of a damaged globe that will have their year long art project on it. Melinda picks one that has the word "" tree."" She tries to put it back but Mr Freeman says not to because that is her "" destiny.""Also, she turns inwards and starts to cut class and hideout in a utility room at her school.And then she, like the trees and shrubs around her, starts to recover after the cold winter and she finally begins to regain her strength and courage. This may explain why the author used the tree as a symbol for Melinda.The story line does not suffer from several plots interweaving like we see so much of but rather all the focus is on this young teen and her nearly year long recovery from her trauma.She befriends a very nice classmate named Dave Petrakis. Perhaps more symbolism here because the name Petrakis refers to a rock or maybe even a bedrock. And he is supportive of her while never really knowing what happened to her.The cast is finely tuned and hums like (fill in your favorite set of wheels). Kudos to the composer Christopher Libertino for a fantastic musical score. His use of a chamber orchestra and piano near the end when Melinda and her mom are driving back home after Melinda was put through another ordeal by Andy, the teen who raped her the previous summer, takes that scene to lofty heights. Happy 10th Year Anniversary, Speak.",Speak
53,Rayweiser21,Speak....the movie,6,1 May 2008,"Glad to see some of you still check in here...Anyway, I read ""Speak"" earlier in the quarter. I thought it was good. It did have a few predictabilities and some holes, but I can see the value in reading it in high school. However, I watched the movie tonight. It is a lot different than the book. It doesn't have the sarcastic tone of the book. In the movie, you learn about the tragic event too early, the parents are semi-interested in Melinda's life and she doesn't go through the ostracism and betrayal that takes place in the book.I agree this would have been a tough movie to make. With a main character that doesn't say much, it really presents a challenge. A lot of you will not like this but I think if the movie wasn't set up like an after-school special, it may have been able to connect with the book more.ObKb, so I have ranted enough for now. The movie, by itself, is a nice view of the lives of high school students. But other than the character names and overall theme, Speak lacks punch! 6 out of 10!",Speak
54,arunkrlal,"Really moving, a well made film",9,18 September 2005,"What was special about this movie? I didn't know much about the film beforehand. It was rated 7.9 on IMDb.com and I have never found a movie with this high rating disappointing. Sometimes it is best to start a movie without knowing or expecting much, and it might turn out a stirrer. Well, that happened this time again and I am pleased.Right from the beginning the film sends feelers that it is indeed an independent film. I associate iconoclastic attributes with a film that has been categorized an independent film. And it was. It is always difficult to portray trauma on screen. Because some may find it exaggerated and some may write it off for being too shallow. This film finds a balance or at least attempts it while dealing with a delicate subject of underage rape. The problem is the girl has not communicated the crime to anyone. Her best friends loathe her now for calling on cops the night. She walked home without telling anyone anything. Now she is starting school and she is just not into it. While battling with herself she doesn't seek any alliances, but doesn't want to relinquish whatever weak bonding she has. She finds an outlet shown by his art teacher. You see her pouring her emotions black, white, and colors sometimes. She is not completely lost though. She still cares about her friends, and want her life back. But perhaps she does not know how to do it by herself. Depicting her self-help techniques works wonderfully. The director and her crew have done fantastic job. Kristen Stewart assays her role as a traumatized teen with confidence. Steve Zahn is first rate. I am keeping this movie for my own collection.",Speak
55,piccolo300000,Best Movie Ever,10,21 November 2005,"Elizabeth Perkins and D.B. Sweeney both gave very believable performances as the Sordinos. Eric Lively was great. Kristen Stewart really shone. She really showed, in this role, that she is a great actress. I was not a fan of hers until I saw her in this movie. When you see it you will understand why. I was left in awe of the movies emotion and story. The directing, writing, acting, and editing are all top-notch. The movie is really under noticed and should be on everyone's to see list. It is a great adaptation of the book, which is also a great read. The movie is about a girl who was raped at a summer party and enters high school, while living with this she tells no one and realizes as the film goes on that it happened and she has to face it. The movie is mostly narrative, but it is actually done correct and delivered great. If you haven't seen this movie and you are thinking about seeing it you will have to buy it, because it was a labeled as a TV movie. I saw it the one weekend that it was on Lifetime, but it also showed on Showtime. High school students will really connect to the things that happen in the school and the humor is really great to teenagers. Parents will love the emotion and quality of the film. It sends a great message and is amazing in its delivery. It is a tragedy, but in the end everything is alright. This is a good film families could watch together, as long as children are, I would say over 13. If you are a parent and want to talk to your kids about things that they might face and you don't know how, watching this movie with them might help. It includes partying and drinking and a sexual assault. It is a good idea to tell your children to watch themselves and make wise decisions. The film really shows that. In conclusion, this film was the greatest movie ever. It had top-notch directing, acting, filming, editing, writing, scenery, etc. I would recommend this movie 10 fold to everyone.",Speak
56,mlawrencewyatt,A decent film,6,14 March 2006,"I think I would have enjoyed this film more if it had not tried to deal with such heavy subject matter. Because the theme was so sensitive and intense, points of mediocre craftsmanship stuck out. Essentially everyone in the film is a stereotype--the art teacher, the English teacher, the History Teacher, Melinda's friends, Melinda's parents, the principal, and the counselor.Kristen Stewart was the best thing about this movie. She had a pretty good command of her facial expressions and mannerisms. It would have been nice if she had some decent lines. The other actors were fairly weak. The score was essentially a non-entity.Like I said, it's an OK film, but it's trying to be more than it is.",Speak
57,thegoodprince,Enthralling,9,13 February 2021,"Speak impacted and affected me on an emotional level in a way that few other films have. The story is really gripping, with its mixture of tragedy, high-school angst, and some well-placed doses of comedy here and there. It's not exactly a comfortable watch. There are some disturbing sequences, as well as a few scenes that are just kind of awkward and hard to watch, but more in a good way. Teenagers are awkward people. These interactions aren't very real if there isn't an underlying awkwardness. Anyway, all of this is to say that I loved this film and would highly recommend it, but I would also recommend that you learn about the content of the film first, as some of it could be triggering for some people.",Speak
58,xxpinkpanther,Great Movie,10,5 September 2005,"Kristen Stewart did an excellent job on this movie. I was personally in tears in many parts of the movie, and I was crying at the end of it too. Even though most of the acting wasn't very good (Heather's lines seemed bland and disorganized), Stewart brought it all back together. Though I cannot relate to Melinda's situation, I was moved to tears by her traumatic experience.All in all, I think this was an amazing film. It doesn't have much relation to the book, and Melinda's character isn't supposed to be dazzling at art, but the entire film was overall great. I would recommend this film to anyone (though they might want to be at least 12 or older).",Speak

When you know things that can improve something you need to speak up. You just can't think things will change without anyone hearing you.

I was gripped from beginning to end in utter shock at such a hard hitting subject turned into an accurate survivors story. I hope Stewart truly knows the impact she has on survivors! The pace and flow of the movie was fantastic. I'm still crying my eyes out and am in utter shock an hour after watching at the perfect acting in a beautiful worthy film.Stewart certainly is a girl who is very gifted! Such an expressive face and body language. The sequence of the film in structure and voice overs allowed perfect connection with characters showing the stupidity of supporting characters in their decision to alienate the central protagonist.Beautiful in showing self expression through realistic art of a fourteen year old as well! i am so glad they chose not to Hollywood up the art to make a big moment!,Speak

The movie is about a teen who was assaulted in a party and kept the fact with her, leading her into a state of loneliness and lack of confidence to share her views with anyone.The subject was very hard to be dealt with but credit should be given to the director Jessica sharzer and of course to Kristen Stewart for a performance that will be remembered throughout her career.Kristen did a fantabulous portrayal of a traumatized teen with an ease.Its very difficult to let the other person know your feelings when you have few words to say but Kristen's expressions and body language did it all effortlessly. The direction of the movie is superb dealing more with expressions and behavior than dialogs.

I was very interested in finding out more, so i searched it on youtube and watched the entire movie.The movie starts with a Melinda, a girl starting high school aboard a bus. You notice that girls are looking at her meanly. You later learn that these girls are once her friends, but after she called the cops at a party last summer, they have exiled her. No one but Melinda really knows what happened at that party, so they all call her squealer. During the movie, we see Melinda having flashbacks from the party, where she meets a guy and they start dancing. Then later you see them kiss a bit, and finally you see him suggest they go for a drive. When they arrive in the car, you see them kissing, and the boy decides to go too far, with Melinda screaming for help. Melinda was raped.The movie continues with Melinda going on with her daily life, but she still has the flashbacks from her horrible past. Eventually, she realizes that it happened, and there is no fixing that, but she can accept it and move on with her life. She decides to tell her ex-friend the truth, because her friend is now dating that horrible guy. Her friend doesn't believe her really, but confronts her boyfriend, and learns the truth. Finally, this guy trys to hurt Melinda again, but her ex friends do come to the rescue of her - but she has learned to stand up for herself. On her way home from school she has the talk with her mother, and you see her finally accepting herself.This movie was absolutely amazing, and Kristen Stewart did an excellent job.

I'm proud of the job done on this production. Well done. You have my attention.",Speak
79,DementiaX,"Everyone in Melinda's school thinks she is weird but don't really care why. Thanks to her perceptive art teacher, she slowly comes to terms with what happened to her.",6,25 September 2008,"When I found out that Kristen Stewart would play Bella in Twilight, I started renting all her movies. I have to say, even though i loved the way she played in all of them, this one really impressed me! Her acting and the film as a whole were spectacular. I would definitely recommend it! Great directing and great editing as well! Even when she is silent and just looking at people, I can almost guess what she 's thinking! Watching this you can really relate to her and feel her exasperation as no one seems to realize that something is really wrong. This film really captures the way many girls feel in this kind of situations. Depressed, embarrassed to admit what happened, restless, suffocated. Very real. I will say no more....you have to watch it.",Speak
80,Staplerguy,Heartbreaking,8,2 March 2010,"Speak moves along unassumingly in a mellow pace. A sense of sadness, unspoken pain and alienation prevails and is beautifully conveyed by a brilliant young Kristen Stewart. Stewart's character Melinda is alienated from her family, friends and teachers by her keeping a traumatic experience to herself, not being able to share the secret with anyone. Melinda soon has no friends, her family does not see her pain and her teachers (with one exception) just view her as being rebellious. This development is portrayed in a completely believable way and Stewart's understated performance is heartbreaking. Melinda's inability to communicate with her family and friends, her inability to speak, makes her inexplicable to them but makes perfect sense to the viewer and has a much deeper emotional impact on the viewer than a thousand words ever would. I am left completely unmoved by manipulative Hollywood tearjerkers, but this little gem is beautifully understated and cannot fail to move anyone with a heart.",Speak
81,mccoolfam,Great film-making,8,11 June 2010,"I stumbled upon this movie which has been showing on the Lifetime channel. I particularly liked the way the movie was done with flashbacks so the story of Melinda's rape unfolds and you don't know why she's so depressed at first. The voice overs are also well done and are effective in furthering the plot. Kristen Stewart is perfect in the role. The plot is very believable and can serve as a lesson to those who are victims of rape as well as those around them. The movie is full of what should be warning signs that something is troubling a person. Also, that rapes should be reported immediately, and the movie is very good at portraying why that is difficult for rape victims to do. Overall just great film-making.",Speak
82,lyssg15,This movie is very triggering.,3,11 July 2010,"Something everyone ought to know before watching this movie is that it contains a very graphic rape scene. If you're a survivor of rape or any kind of sexual trauma, watching Speak can be a very painful and triggering experience. I'm really surprised that no one has mentioned that before. The movie does a decent job of documenting what a survivor goes through post- trauma, but for most people it's not that easy.Besides all of that, Kristen Stewart does a very good job of not acting very well. It's a shame she went to that Twilight nonsense after this. She could have gone on to act poorly in other really depressing movies. She really isn't all that stellar.",Speak
83,byfar,Loved this film at Sundance!,8,25 January 2004,"I just returned from the Sundance Film Festival, where I was lucky enough to attend the premiere screening of ""Speak"" (after waiting 2 hours in line . ..).  It was worth the wait.  I fear this film will be pigeonholed as just a ""teen movie,"" which would be a shame because it touches on themes that resonate with adults as well.  I'll admit I cried during the film, but then so did many of the people around me.  I haven't heard whether it got distribution yet or not -- I can't imagine that it wouldn't.  I understand it will air on Showtime eventually, as they helped in the production.  Wish it could always be shown with the short that preceded it at Sundance, ""The Vest,"" which was delightful.",Speak
84,shellchrispower,Absaloutley Amazing,10,2 December 2011,"This movie is now my favourite. I literally only seen it last night and i was completely blown away, it is so grown up and i am so surprised it didn't win an Oscar or anything, i should have because Kristen Stewart and well everybody was amazing in it.I can really relate to Melaney's character minus the rape in the story line, i mean like i fell out with my best friends when i was 14 and i got really depressed and didn't talk to anybody and this movie completely reminds me of that in a good way i mean, its hard to explain but the movie is very touching and inspiring to all girls i think and i am giving the cast a round of appaulase because they were great.Sorry for all the miss-spelling I'm not the best ha xx Thanks for reading this and please go and watch the film it is really great.",Speak
85,bolling_e,but didn't you notice !,9,7 December 2011,"love love the movie, storyline is realistic and moving and scarily real,hoping this movie not only highlights the real issues addressed but maybe helps those who feel they cant speak.the reason i watched the movie is of course KRISTIN STEWART ,who portrays the character believably and emotionally, there is just something intriguing about her.But did anyone notice the voice over is not Kristen's voice, maybe it's just me but i think hearing her voice in a lot of movies, especially TWILIGHT, just didn't believe the voice over was her.who cares great movie!",Speak
86,marinicaionel,"Great movie, very underrated",9,8 July 2021,I wish more people knew about this movie. It deserves a cult following. The protagonist is very fascinating and interesting to follow. The message is very optimistic and motivating even if you can't relate to the character.,Speak
87,spam10987654321,8/10,8,15 October 2012,"The filming was simple and there wasn't any big effects but that was okay. I liked the plot but it was most just a story.. Like there wasn't any big turn points or events, it was mostly Melinda reliving what had happened. I really missed some bigger events, but besides from that it was a good and different high school movie. So it's definitely worth watching, but you should probably not watch it with young kids.I have to write ten lines, but I don't really know what more to write. It was a great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I'm fifteen years old and would recommend it for teens at my age but adults would probably like it too.",Speak
88,MaxThieriotIsMySuperman,kristen was wonderful,10,5 August 2004,I saw this movie at the film festival and I fell in love with it. Kristen is my fav actor so I just had to see it. Kristen was so amazing she does things with her expressions and her face detail the actors older then her are still trying to accomplish. I can't wait to buy it so I can watch it over and over and admire her talent! I also thought that they were also many great actors in this film. I have to give credit to jessica the screen writer she did an amazing job. At first I didn't know how the movie was going to turn out because it is all basically in Melindas head. But it turned out awesome and I cannot wait for it to come out so I cam admire it at home everyday. You rock Kristen.,Speak
89,bigdaddyzgurl2000,I think..........,10,25 December 2004,"I, of course, thought the movie was great. Not only did I read the book, I was also in the movie! I was one of the girls in the group right in front of the school (I was the African American girl w/ the braids in the group w/ 2 Caucasian girls and another African American girl and we were talking about ""Melinda""). It was so hot during the making of the movie and some girl got dehydrated and had to be taken to the hospital.I mean we were dressed in ""fall/winter"" attire and it was like in August. The movie, if you didn't know already was filmed at some high school in Columbus. In all the movie was quite like the book and they're both wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Speak
90,polaroidsmiles,"Just saw it, and loved it",10,14 October 2005,"I ordered this from Amazon, and I just finished seeing it. It's wonderful! I loved the book, and I love the movie just as much, if not more.Very powerful story, with just as powerful an actress playing lead.I think one of my most favorite scenes in this movie has to be the part where Melinda shows Mr. Freeman her closet in the school.The look on his face is so real, so understanding.Of everything I've seen Kristen Stewert in, this is my favorite movie of hers!If you haven't seen this yet, I recommend it :) Have a few Kleenex handy though, as it's really emotional.",Speak
91,pennedink,Really enjoyed it,10,8 August 2013,"I think a lot of people tend to come down pretty hard on Kristen Stewart, but I think she really is a great actress. I watched the Twilight movies a couple of years after they first came out, and I thought she did a decent job. But Speak...this was some really great acting. I really loved the scenes with the art teacher, especially the last one.The range of emotion Kristen showed in this movie were so varied, and very believable. I think she really shone in this movie, and it makes me interested in checking out other movies that she has done.If you're not sure if you want to see Speak, give it a chance like I did. I almost didn't watch it, but now I'm glad that I did.",Speak
92,SkiDeep85,Awesome movie,10,20 February 2005,"Well i have to say i also was in the movie i got to throw mashed potatoes at someone and boy it was hard though, it was awesome, i read the book and it was a great story and i cant wait for this movie to come to theaters. I got to meet some great people in the making of this film like a girl named Erin and also Jordan, they are great people , i agree that school was way hot and also at one point during the shoot the power went off in the school and it was raining and also that whole time we were sitting in the auditorium was driving me crazy. But i have to say i loved it when we went to taping at the house it was a blast.Also it was a good experience and i enjoyed working in this film and thanks to everyone in it and the crew who were very nice to us.",Speak
93,Soulsearcher147,This movie was so touching...,9,6 September 2005,"After reading the book numerous times throughout middle school and high school, I have to say that the movie exceeded my expectations. It was beautifully done and Melinda was portrayed exactly as I thought of her in the novel. I felt an incredible connection with Melinda and seemed to feel everything that she was feeling throughout the course of the movie. The part of the movie most effective to me was the scene where she was showing her art teacher all of the trees she had painted and drawn over the course of the year. It was a beautiful scene...very emotional. I was also happy to see the field hockey girls come to the rescue in the closet scene. For me, this movie was incredible and I would suggest it to people of all ages.",Speak
94,grapecola,Speak: The Book vs. The Film,9,4 October 2005,"I have been a fan of the book for a long time, and when I noticed that Sho-time was playing a movie called Speak, I was interested. I was so excited that somebody actually made the book into a movie. I watched the movie, and I have to say that, even though I hadn't read the book in a long time, the movie was very true to the story. I liked that a lot of the symbolism used in the book made its way into film.Also, I found that, like the book, the film was very internal. You could really tell how isolated this girl felt. Sometimes this is hard to do in film.I recommend reading the book, either before or after seeing the movie. They are both great, either together or separate. It sounds crazy, but the stories are completely the same, but also different. All in all, they were both great, moving experiences.",Speak
95,nicolyie,Ugh,1,6 September 2005,"Speak is by far one of my favorite books. My favorite books happen to have a way of becoming bad movies, and this is one of them. This movie was full of errors, Melinda doesn't live in the Midwest, Heather is a model, so she couldn't be that fat, and Melinda even said herself, she was average weight, not anorexic looking like she was in the movie. The actors didn't fit the roles at all, and while the girl who played Melinda had the sad look down, she didn't have the voice. She just wasn't Melinda. Ivy didn't run with the Goths and the Marthas, she ran with the thespians and the artists! (or something to that degree,I can't remember exactly) David Petrakis was supposed to be tall and gangly, not stocky. Andy Evans...I'm sure everyone imagined him blonde. And Rachelle, well, she did not fit the description at all. In conclusion, this movie was terrible. Awful. Just plain bad. Speak fans, don't go see it unless you want to be outraged.",Speak
96,psycholynch1979,Start to Finish Symbolism,9,5 September 2005,"When I saw this film I cried at the beautiful use of symbolism. The color orange as a negative color, trees as a reminder, not being able to speak, speaking through art, The Scarlet Letter and being branded as something, etc.An excellent mention is Kristen Stewart's performance and expressions--incredible. The school year as being marked by holidays was excellent. The rape scene broken in pieces like a puzzle was perfect.The scene at the end when the art teacher (Steve Zahn) sees Melina's finished tree projects is incredibly moving, the whole time he was hearing her, but she never had to utter a word. Trees in general were a huge symbol. Her original picture looked phallic with the trunk and circle of leaves... and she was able to speak her rape terror in her pictures.At the end when Melinda blinds Andy she takes his vision like he took her voice. A perfect revenge in standing up for yourself and defending your body... :-) A great educational experience.",Speak
97,margotlane,finding your voice,8,7 October 2005,"I thought I'd try to speak up & just say as someone who was raped & who is now in the process of trying to heal and to speak, this film helped me. I would encourage teachers, students, friends & parents to look for the signs shown by the woman trying to tell others what happened, as it's very hard to say anything at all. If you know someone who seems particularly silenced, it might help if you showed them this book or film. I hope that in the book, the boy isn't just seen as The Bad Guy-- if people want to stop this from happening in the first place, change has to happen-- with men, while they are young. I hope that in high schools now there are more therapists available who can see the signs and make visiting them seem not like a stigma or dangerous or too hard to do.",Speak
98,katiebaker06,raw and inspired,10,11 August 2006,"Speak without a doubt brought a face to a much ignored problem in America today. It was one of the best movies generally geared towards teens that I've seen in a long time. If your looking for a teen princess Cinderella story, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you think you could be inspired by the unnervingly real story of a drowning teenage girl trying to find her way to the surface again, Speak is the movie for you. Melinda is a normal girl facing the clichéd issues of high school drama and parental problems until an untold event turns her world upside down. Piece by piece, Melinda's occasional flashbacks reveal the occurrences of that night. Meanwhile, the young woman struggles to remain sane with the help of a quirky teacher who helps her to find an outlet for her emotional distress.",Speak
99,cinnamonq,Introduction & Reaction,10,25 October 2005,"Speak tells the story of a girl starting her first year in high school. She was raped at a friend's party the previous summer. After she was raped she called the police and many people at the party were charged with underage drinking. The following year everyone is angry at her for calling the police, but no on except the guy who raped her knows why she called the police. She struggles with the anger of her peers over call to the police and her own emotional state after the rape. Speak tells it like it is when it comes to junior high and high school life without either over dramatizing or censoring what happens. Best of all it is inspiring story of recovery and how one girl finds her voice.",Speak
100,cnmolitor,Amazing,10,5 November 2005,"This movie was so moving,I was in tears.In the end, I wished I was her in the closet beating the crap out of that boy.It really makes you look at yourself and say ""Why did I let that pass?"".I read the book a year or two ago and it made me think the character was a strange little goth girl who just got raped at an innocent house party gone wrong.But Melinda's character proved different.I loved her in Panic Room, and I adored her in this movie.Such an amazing story that really points out to us that no matter who you are,this could happen to you.This movie really inspired me and probably everyone who has seen it to be you and to not let just anything pass by without standing up for what you believe in.Overall an amazing movie.",Speak
101,goodzille,E-motion-ally touching storyline,10,3 January 2006,"Frankly, I am not the kind who love to watch such a serious and emotionally touching story. And I may never watch 'Speak' if it wasn't because of Kristen. Well, I had watched her before in 'Catch That Kid' and she was totally handled the characteristics of Madeline well and Kristen is also distinctively attractive, isn't she? Thus, after I found out that she was in 'Speak', I decided to watch it from the moment I found it out(not so beginning) and I surprisingly tagged to watch it till the end of the story. It was amazing! Imagine the characteristics of a raped and boycotted girl Kristen has to offer to the viewers. Extremely difficult, isn't it? And I don't think I am the only one who agrees that Kristen has done an exemplary job. I almost could feel the sadness, the loneliness and the depression in the character of Melinda through Kristen's natural talent of making facial expressions, her every tone and motion, like Kristen had really experienced the similar trauma that Melinda had. In a nutshell, I really wish that I can watch it again from the really beginning because Kristen has extremely done an incredible job as Melinda Sordino in 'Speak'.",Speak
