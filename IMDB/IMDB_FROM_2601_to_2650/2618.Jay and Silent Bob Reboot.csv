0,SnoopyStyle,friends,6,1 March 2020,"Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) get arrested by SWAT. A sleazy Hollywood lawyer steals their name and the boys discover that Bluntman and Chronic is getting rebooted. They have to go to Hollywood to stop it. Jay finds out that he has a grown daughter.This is chalk full of nostalgic referencing of Kevin Smith's career. It is filled with friends who are more or less family. This is just about the Kevin Smith fan who knows all of his work. Chris Hemsworth has the funniest cameo as a hologram. Ben Affleck has the most profound cameo although the joy seems to have been drained out of him. As a story, it's not that complicated. It's more a series of crude insults and jokes. Kevin's daughter has a large role. This is really a celebration of Kevin Smith's career and an excuse to make fun of himself. I just wish for a better written plot that is more than a road movie.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
1,nogodnomasters,All the wrong reasons,6,18 March 2020,"Jay and Silent Bob give away the rights to their name as it is being used in a reboot. There is a kick-off of the film in Hollywood at the Chronic-Con event. They travel to Hollywood in an attempt to stop the feature. Jay is traveling with his daughter Milly (Harley Quinn Smith) who in real life is Kevin Smith's daughter, although she looks more like Jay (Jason Mewes). The film was packed with old film and pop culture references, I dare say I did not get them all. It was also a critique of itself claiming the reboot was horrible, Kevin Smith was a bad director who always puts his daughter into the film. There are references to ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Clerks"" two productions I did not see as well as something to do with Jersey Girls. All in all the film attempts to bill Kevin Smith as some pop culture icon. This is something I don't like. Pop culture iconic films should always be decided by the viewing audience and never by a self-promoting director who talks way too much in the film to be called ""Silent.""Bill and Ted were better.Be sure to watch the credits as it appears they cut the best scenes and placed them there.Guide: F-word. No sex. Nudity?",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
2,BA_Harrison,Excuse me while I stick the boot in.,2,18 September 2020,"The big question I had before going in to Reboot was 'Is this film going to be as bad as Jason Mewes' Method In The Madness?'. I'm glad to say that the answer is 'No', but it was a very close call.Kevin Smith - who hasn't made a really good film since... well... Clerks - loads his Jay and Silent Bob Reboot with ironic meta content and wokeness in the desperate hope that, by being self-aware, self referential and all-inclusive, his viewers will mistake the film's crapness for intelligence and progressiveness. His ploy doesn't work: the godawful script is neither witty nor innovative and all attempts at inclusivity make for an excruciating watch. All those involved should be ashamed of themselves for not acknowledging that fact and quitting once they had read the script (the only exception being Smith's daughter Harley Quinn, a dreadful actress who is clearly grateful for nepotism).I'm rather ashamed to admit that I actually sniggered twice, both times at something totally puerile, but it doesn't take a lot to make me laugh; the fact that the rest of the film left me stony-faced says a lot about it's awfulness. Hell, a well-timed fart joke would even have been welcome (it worked for Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back).2/10. Even Justin Long, who is Brandon St. Randy in all but name, failed to make me laugh.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
3,BandSAboutMovies,Not good,2,26 May 2020,"You remember that friend from high school or college that you went through so much with and then lost touch? You might keep up with one another on the internet or check in on Facebook, but you always mean to hang out someday. Finally, when you do, you're reminded of their worst annoyances and realize why you never worried all that much about truly staying in touch.Welcome to that person in film form.This movie is the very definition of ""If it works for you, good for you.""It may have worked for me twenty some odd years ago, but it feels trapped in that time, like a nostalgia band that's living off two or less hits, moving siblings and relatives to play bass and slowly playing smaller and smaller venues. It's not totally that way, as this movie did make money. But it just feels like diminishing returns, like a story I've seen before, coming from a place where nostalgia and remember that time has replaced any chance of originality.In the same way that I don't care about most prequels, that's how I feel about this sequel. I thought the multiple sendoffs these characters have had were enough. Yet I get it. People love these films and I feel like exactly the kind of person I hated when I was obsessed with the ViewAskewniverse.So, at the risk of saying things like, ""the last twenty minutes of this movie are wasted moments that I will regret forever,"" let me just say that if you liked the other films and want more, here it is.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
4,grantss,Kevin Smith covers old ground and it's as unoriginal and predictable as you would imagine,3,31 October 2020,"Jay and Silent Bob inadvertently sign away their names and rights to the new Bluntman and Chronic movie. Now they head to Hollywood to stop the film from being made. Along the way Jay discovers that he is a father.Kevin Smith's first movie, Clerks, was brilliant. What followed was a series of often-juvenile yet hilariously funny comedies: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma. Secondary characters in all these movies were Jay and Silent Bob (Silent Bob being played by Smith himself). They got their own movie in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) and while this wasn't bad it did demonstrate that they really were at their best as background characters, rather than main characters.This film also started a slide in Smith's creative output, with Jersey Girl and Clerks II being mediocre, at best. 'Zack and Miri make a porno' marked a return to form for Smith before another sub-standard offering in Cop Out. Smith then tried drama: Red State was pretty good but Tusk was incredibly bad.Now he's covering old ground with another Jay and Silent Bob movie. It's all pretty unoriginal and predictable and the humour is fairly weak. The only positive moments are the Hollywood and Kevin Smith film and family in-jokes and even these ultimately get done to death to the point of being trite and tedious.Not worth watching, even if you're a Kevin Smith fan.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
5,deloudelouvain,This is getting old and is just not funny anymore.,4,30 January 2021,"In the past I enjoyed movies from Kevin Smith. Jay and Silent Bob used to make me laugh, but that was in the past, a long distant past as it seems. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is just not the same level of stoner humor that we're used to get from them. I laughed a couple times with this movie, although it was more a couple of mild grins instead of good laughs. The cast consists of good actors and comedians but the story is just not interesting, it's rather boring. I think it's time to call it a day for Kevin Smith, it just doesn't work anymore.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
6,Mr-Fusion,"The spirit is willing, but . . .",5,20 April 2020,"My wife looked over at me during the end credit outtakes and said, ""Why couldn't the rest of the movie be this funny?""We fully agree on that one.Context helps a lot in this case. I can't remember where I'd read this (Facebook, probably), but someone argued that Kevin Smith, having just survived a brush with death, wanted to make a movie with all of his friends. And that's precisely what Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is because everyone shows up (including every last View Askewniverse reference). And given their years-long separation, it's honestly sweet to see Affleck make an appearance and bury the hatchet. The good faith in an undertaking like this is admirable.I just wish one of the jokes landed.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
7,siderite,Like a nostalgic SNL sketch that runs for too long,7,10 January 2020,"The movie is so meta that it makes fun of reboots and remakes. It's also a bit fun, but in order to enjoy it you need to satisfy a few conditions: 1) remember what the hell happened in Jay and Silent Bob 2) Liking the Jay and Silent Bob movie 3) being down with nostalgic reunions with every actor that Smith and Jay ever knew (or birthed) and guilted into cameo-ing in this and 4) not be freaked out by Val Kilmer's appearance. I vaguely remember finding the JaSB guys funny, in a sidekick sidestory aside kind of way, but I can't say remember a thing about the movie. That's why my advice is to rewatch it before you watch this. If you don't like it, watching the reboot is a waste of time. And then there is the cameo thing. At first you are delighted, then it goes a bit too far, then it goes way overboard and then you stop caring or, worse, you feel bad because you don't know who that guy is and what the reference is.Bottom line: Alanis Morissette is not in this, which is unforgivable. Other than that, it felt like a long SNL sketch that announces SNL is over. It was partially fun, but the effect on me was : this is either not as fun as the original or the original was as fun as this... so I remember it too fondly. Sorry, Kevin, Deadpool this is not.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
8,FeastMode,surprisingly awesome,7,23 March 2020,"I laughed a lot. and it had some unexpected heart. the performances by the two much older actors didn't feel forced. i enjoyed it almost as much as the first one (1 viewing, 3/22/2020)",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
9,bowmanblue,One for the fans,7,10 July 2020,"I'm a big fan of Kevin Smith's films and, in particular, his 'Viewaskewniverse,' which was basically his very own comedy 'shared universe' long before Marvel adopted the business model for their superhero films. Therefore, 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot' is the latest in a long line of movies which have the same characters in it which started all the way back in the mid nineties. So, as a 'die-hard' fan, I enjoyed it. Just.The film follows the titular pair of dozy stoners who find out that - yet another - film is being made about their exploits and they must race across American from New Jersey to Hollywood in order to stop it getting made. Now, if you know the plot of 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' then you'll realise the plot is identical. This is deliberate. For the film pokes fun at Hollywood's current obsession with sequels, remakes and reboots.Along the way, Jay and Silent Bob meet up with various characters from all the previous movies, not to mention making jokes directly related to their former exploits. I got every one of them, but it's worth noting that the person I watched this with was only a 'fairweather' Kevin Smith fan and she didn't get half of what was referenced. I guess this leads me to conclude that 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot' is mainly aimed at the existing fans of the franchise and only those with extensive knowledge will get the most out of it.I also read online by a 'professional' film reviewer that one reason it almost didn't work out this time was because the film's 'core audience' (namely me!) was once well into the 'stoner humour' which Smith bases his work on. Now we've grown up, so has our sense of humour and we don't always laugh at what we did once.I enjoyed the film, but I'm guessing that if you don't know anything about the previous work of Kevin Smith, not to mention enough about general pop culture and movies, then you're not going to get much out of this film. Definitely worth a watch if you're into the franchise, but a confusing viewing experience if you're not.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
10,ThomasDrufke,Worth it For Affleck Alone,8,31 October 2019,"The way you need to see this movie is in a crowd full of die-hard View Askew universe fans. If you have been a fan of Kevin Smith's work at all over the last few decades, there's plenty to enjoy here. And perhaps most impressively, Smith and co-star Jason Mewes bring a surprising amount of heart to the story and characters, who haven't necessarily provided that to these two beloved characters in previous films. You can tell this is a far more mature Smith and Mewes and it pays off. Oh, and the endless amount of cameos and surprises don't hurt either. That Ben Affleck scene is one of my favorites in 2019. It's worth the price of admission alone.8.4/10",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
11,Bored_Dragon,"A sequel, remake, and reboot that mocks sequels, remakes, and reboots",6,27 May 2020,"""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot"" is the latest work by the cult Kevin Smith, in which he mercilessly mocks himself. The film is at the same time a sequel, remake and reboot of the ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (2001), a homage and a parody of Smith's previous filmography, in which, as before, he mocks pop culture, but this time also his own movies, and even personality and private life. I've always had a fondness for people capable of making fun of themselves, especially when they're witty and ruthless, and the film, as I am a big fan of Kevin Smith, has also awakened nostalgia. But, as its name suggests, ""Reboot"" brings a little new and relies almost exclusively on a rehash of old jokes, aiming at the nostalgic emotions of the audience rather than their intellect. Compared to his early classics, which are never outdated and are equally fresh and fun even after many reruns, I must say that Kevin has lost the edge here. While it isn't bad, it's a quite forgettable and somewhat pathetic movie for one viewing.6/10",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
12,UniqueParticle,Masterpiece in comedy - On par with original and hilarious!,10,18 October 2019,"So glad I was able to see this epic film, especially since there was special features afterwards! I laughed so much and loud even during parts when no one else was. Such a fun experience filled with so much silliness, surprises, great soundtrack, and still living up to be great even as a continuation it's exactly what I wanted. I am happy Kevin Smith was able to make this after his heart scare, beyond worth every penny! I highly recommend this delightful flick and I'll definitely buy it when I can!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
13,eddie_baggins,A film for the fans and no one else,6,18 March 2020,"If you've found yourself at a moment in time where you're about to sit down and partake in the newest entry into Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse, the extremely meta and self-parody heavy Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, you're doing so for a very particular reason and set of expectations, that Smith's ode to the good old days of his independent career will most certainly deliver on.Reboot, to be clear, is not a great movie in itself, it's hastily put together, has a painfully long in the tooth finale and features a bare bones story that is not worth much discussion but with a new, more sentimental life view driving star, writer and director Smith, Reboot is somehow still highly likable in a way in which only this well established brand and set of characters can do.After recovering from a very serious and near fatal heart attack, you can sense throughout that Reboot has come from a place of good intentions as Smith throws his famous stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob into a Hollywood defacing and musing on parenthood and love tale that sees the well-liked filmmaker in the best state his been in over the last decade after such debacles as Yoga Hosiers and the horrific Tusk.With so much baggage and background, seeing Jay and Silent Bob back together is like spending time with old friends as Jason Mewes and Smith prove, that despite being now to old for this type of thing, they've still got it, as the duo find themselves on a cross country journey that is pretty much an excuse for Smith to get the gang back together again in what's a star-stuffed affair that is going to have Smith die-hards salivating at the very anticipation of whose coming up next.From old time Smith creations like Ben Affleck's Holden McNeil, Matt Damon's Loki, Shannon Elizabeth's Justice, Jason Lee's Brodie Bruce and Brian O'Halloran's Dante Hicks, Reboot is absolutely loaded with throwbacks, character beats and even story conclusions as Smith and his leading collection of players set about ensuring Hollywood doesn't go ahead with further adventures of Bluntman and Chronic.With so much reference and homage present across the entire run-time of Reboot, it makes itself a must-watch for long time Smith fans and while it's by no means as good as Smith's most accomplished and memorable cult hits, there's something about the fact Reboot isn't trying to be anything that it's not in a movie making climate that often tries it's hardest to float downstream, even if it would be wise from here on out for Smith to retire these characters from future solo outings.Final Say -Far from cinematic greatness, Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is a film for the fans, giving them exactly what they expect in a refreshingly uncompromising manner, making this film a winner for all those that matter.3 tater tots out of 5",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
14,arfdawg-1,"Wow, Bad",2,16 January 2020,I liked a bunch of films these two have been in but 20/30 year old characters doing stupid stuff is funny while 40/50 year old characters doing stupid stuff is sad.Bob looks horrible with his weight loss. And Jay seems like he's back on the juice.The story is poorly written. Very poorly written. It's not funny nor is it interesting. Even the guest pots fall flat.So sad.,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
15,southdavid,"If I can be blunt, man . . .",5,13 July 2020,"Following his near-death heart attack, Kevin Smith self-finances a film that redefines self-indulgence. A film in which he casts his friends and family, and not only allows you to catch up with characters from his previous films, but is impenetrable to anyone without a working knowledge of them.Having learned that Hollywood is planning a reboot of ""Bluntman and Chronic"" a failed superhero franchise from a decade past. Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) must again cross the country from New Jersey to California to stop the movie, based on themselves, from being made. A chance encounter has Jay reunite with Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) who informs him that he has a daughter, Millennium (Harley Quinn Smith).If, by any chance, you're planning on watching this movie having not previously watched the films that make up Smith's view-askew-niverse, just don't. 'Impenetrable' really is the right word, character's come and go without explanation, many lines are call backs to something that happened, or was said in one of the previous movies and without that back knowledge I'm not sure that the film would even make sense to you. This is not to say that with that prior knowledge, the film is brilliant, or good, or even passable. The flaws are apparent, even to those of us that do have it. The performances are generally poor, the story is weak (even if you accept the meta-commentary aspect of the film rebooting ""strike back"") and most of the jokes don't land. It is a tick box exercise in seeing a character, or actor again, with everything else hung around that. I'm so happy that Jason Mewes is still alive to be in the film that this seems like a churlish comment, but his dentures bend his lips into such an odd pout I kept thinking that it was someone else and it was a constant distraction.However. As it came to an end - I found I couldn't bring myself to actually hate it. There was just enough in the moments with Ben Affleck, Chris Hemsworth, Stan Lee, Millie's interactions with Jay and the stuff at Chronic-con to drag the score up a little and make me look forward to, when hopefully shorn of quite as much indulgence, ""Clerks 3"" and ""Mallrats 2"" see the light of day.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
16,subxerogravity,Just when you thought Jay and Silent Bob where done...Reboot!,8,18 October 2019,"Kevin Smith milks everything he has out of his View Askew Universe, but this Milk don't spoil. I went into this hoping that it would be good and as it turns out it was great.Jay and his hederal life mate Silent bob may have gotten older but they still feel young and relevant(ironically in their irrelevance which adds to the humor). It's been a while snice we seen these dudes (18 years to be exact), but it felt like they never left. They seem even more hip now because you know fart jokes never go out of style (excuse my language IMDB does not allow me to tell you what type of jokes this movie is really filled with).Ironically Kevin Smith pokes fun at reboots by making the best reboot ever with Jay and Silent Bob leaving their home town of Leonardo, NJ (perhaps only for the third time), they set out on a new quest to stop the reboot of Blunt man and Chronic from happening, along the way the View Askew universe is revisited from Clerks to Jay and Silent Bob strikes back, he had this cinematic universe down before Kevin Smith's beloved Marvel movies were even close to being a thing. The Reboot also consisted of a large amount of celebrity cameos slightly more impressive than the stuff on Strikes Back (but still showing that Smith is an indi filmmaker).Smith's got one thing going for him, he does know how to tell a story. He knows how to make long stretches of dialog never boring. This movie's never boring its filled with funny moment after moment. I was not expecting to like this but man did I love this.It's great!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
17,jtindahouse,One of the few Smith film I haven't enjoyed,5,18 February 2020,"It's very rare that I don't enjoy a Kevin Smith film. Even his more out there and different things like 'Tusk' I have absolutely loved. Usually if I can't get on board with the story I can at least sit back and enjoy some splendid dialogue. For some reason even that was missing in 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot'. The dialogue felt lazy, uncreative and like something any old filmmaker could have written. And the story, while I understand that it was clever making fun of remakes, reboots and sequels whilst being all three, just didn't do anything for me. Very disappointing.The thing that saves this from being a complete mess is the trip down nostalgia lane. It was so great seeing all these actors and characters again from the Kevin Smith universe. It's mind-blowing just how long it has been since we have seen them, even the most recent ones haven't been seen for 13 years. Some of the cameos work a lot better than others naturally. None are terrible to the point of you wanting them to finish, but they certainly could have been done a bit better with a little more effort going into their scenes.The best of the Smith films I could watch over and over and over again. I think one watch for 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot' will be enough I'm sad to say. I hoped to laugh a lot, instead I lightly chuckled maybe twice. Not one to rush out and see.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

20,jimbo-53-186511,"It gave me a few laughs, but it probably relies a little too heavily on nostalgia",6,3 September 2020,"When they learn that their alter egos are the subject of a reboot the eponymous Jay and Silent Bob head off to Hollywood to prevent the film from being made. Along the way they encounter some unexpected cargo and learn some home truths/unexpected life lessons whilst undertaking this journey...Whilst I found the Jay and silent Bob reboot to be fairly enjoyable it did not really get the belly laughs from me that the original film got; although I am prepared to accept that I watched the original film at the cinema and haven't watched it since. Therefore, perhaps as I'm now quite a bit older (and believe me it's depressing for me to hear teenagers refer to people born before the 1990's as being old - like dude wtf??). However, there is a slight issue in watching 2 men who are in their late 40's still trying to behave like they are in their 20's. In fairness, the film offsets this slightly with Jay's character being forced to grow up a bit, but somehow it just doesn't work quite as well here or come off as convincingly.The story in itself is quite flimsy and silly and in some ways it's hard to overlook the fact that this film may have merely acted as a very cheap way for a lot of cast members from Kevin Smith's previous films just to have something of a reunion. I can imagine that they all had fun making this film, but the feeling is that it was probably more fun for them than it was for the audience.Not wishing to be too mean I have to admit that the film still has its funny moments and as director Kevin Smith deserves some credit for the self-deprecating approach that he brought to the material (which is arguably one of the film's biggest strengths).It doesn't touch the original film and the sheer number of cameos shoehorned into the film does make the film reek of desperation, but the film still had some funny moments, but the film itself will probably appeal more to Kevin Smith and his peers rather than a mainstream audience.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
21,jfgibson73,I would be disappointed if I had any expectations of enjoying it,4,2 February 2020,"I found this movie entirely unfunny. I've never seen a movie that so explicitly explains its own jokes. It relies on you to love everything that Kevin Smith does without question. It is full of callbacks and in-jokes meant to appease his hardcore audience, but alienates everyone else. I think when I watched Clerks, I laughed the hardest I ever have at a movie, but those days are long gone. I did enjoy the subplot about the family stuff to a degree, but it also felt extremely forced. Just because some of the characters tear up doesn't mean the viewer will. I decided to sit through this movie mostly just to see who made appearances in it, but I don't think I enjoyed a single cameo. If these characters ever appear again, I hope it is in small supporting roles--they do not belong in the spotlight.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
22,questl-18592,View Askew Reboot,4,18 March 2020,"I like this universe. Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, Jay & Silent Bob, I like the lot of them, quite a bit too. This is bad though. This felt like a 95 minute wink at the camera, an endless stream of, ""Heeeey, remember this movie? Yeah? Oh what about this gag? Wasn't that a hoot?"" Yeah, it was, the first time. Kevin Smith clearly has some stuff he wanted to say about Hollywood's current reboot culture but man, write a book, do a podcast about it, host a lecture series I don't know but not this because criticizing something and making fun of it while at the same time shamelessly doing it doesn't work. The movie itself constantly reminds us how much it's copying from Jay & Silent Bob Stoke Back with a near identical plot.Thing is, there's still some fun here. Some surprise cameos, some funny jokes and I do enjoy this universe. That last bit is the kicker though. If someone doesn't enjoy this universe from the previous movies this will more than likely be downright unwatchable, so keep that in mind.I'm disappointed, Mr. Smith.

Unfortunately, Kevin Smith hasn't made a decent movie in years. This falls into that category. Funny in parts but not funny enough overall. The nepotism angle hits hard since neither his daughter or wife are decent actors. And the 'Russian' wasn't only a bad actor but had an atrocious actress.

25,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot""- A very messy but frequently funny tribute to the View Askewniverse.",7,25 January 2020,"Well. Look at all these morose bad reviews right here. Smells like someone crapped in their cereal.It's fascinating to look at the reception to Kevin Smith's latest film, ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,"" the long-awaited seventh chapter in the twenty-five year old franchise known as the ""View Askewniverse."" The movie was met with predominately solid reviews from critics on release and garnered a predictably warm reception from longtime fans. At first, it seemed very much like Smith hit a homerun. And yet, just a few months later, audiences have seemingly turned completely against it, with the movie being slammed over and over in user-reviews and in comments sections all over the internet.And where do I find myself in all of this? Well, I'm... kind of in the middle if I'm to be honest. On one hand, yeah. I can kinda see where the negativity is coming from. ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot"" is often messy, at times unfocused and at its worst... even occasionally nonsensical. It's less a movie and more a string of skits tied together with the flimsiest of plots. But on the other hand... I actually had a really good time watching this film. I laughed quite a bit, was won over by the heart of what story there was, and had a wonderfully warm feeling of nostalgia throughout. On an objective level, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the heck out of the experience. It's just unfortunately a bumpy ride at times.Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith) must set out to Hollywood once again when they discover a new film is being made out of the old comic-book ""Bluntman and Chronic,"" which of course was based around them. Along the way they get into various misadventures, as Jay meets his long-lost daughter (Harley Quinn Smith) and her multi-cultural group of friends, they get into a tangle with the Ku Klux Klan, and discover they must infiltrate a massive fan-convention where a key scene from the film is being shot. Oh, and there's cameos galore as many familiar faces from the ""View Askewniverse"" make appearances, often in very surprising ways.Part of the great appeal of the film is having one more chance to catch up with the characters we love, and it is a genuine pleasure to see them again. Despite having aged quite a bit since their last outing, Mewes and Smith slip right back into the shoes of their stoner alter-egos and are as entertaining as ever. I also really enjoyed Harley Quinn Smith in a role that actually made her stretch her chops as an actress. And appearances from frequent Smith collaborators including Jason Lee, Brian O'Halloran and even Ben Affleck are welcome and help tie the film- and the series- together. I was particularly taken with Affleck's scene, as it has quite a bit of weight given his past appearances in the View Askew universe. It all gives the film a lovely sense of nostalgia that I found quite appealing.And while it may be subjective, I did laugh quite a bit throughout the movie. It's definitely not one of Smith's better-made films and it obviously suffers a low-budget, but there are some genuinely clever scenes at play. Particularly during the protracted climax set in the ""Bluntman and Chronic"" fan convention. I won't spoil anything, but be prepared to laugh if you're a longtime fan of Smith's work, both on-screen and off. I was also really impressed by the heart of the film- Jay's realization that he has a long-lost daughter that he wants to reconnect with. It gave the film a little extra emotional ""oomph,"" so-to-speak, even if it's not always the main focus.Unfortunately, the trade-off to this is the quality of the writing and the general execution, which is where the film loses a few points for me. For all the film does right in the nostalgia department and in the humor, it's just not all that well made. You can tell they had a lower budget this time around, and Smith doesn't always make the most of it. It's often very flat looking, and doesn't really have a sense of scope. For a road-trip movie... it feels like it was all shot on studio-backlots and sets. And the writing is about as flimsy as it could be. While the emotional storyline of Jay and his daughter ""Milly"" is genuinely well-executed, the rest of the script is really patchy and uneven. Like I said above, it's more a collection of skits than an actual film. I also had some minor issues with the pacing, as some scenes did go on a bit too long, and some of the cameos felt kind of stretched out. A far superior film could have been made if they just trimmed about ten or so minutes of ""fat"" from the story. And my god... I really didn't understand a bizarre running joke about ""Hater Tots,"" and wish that whole ""subplot"" had been cut out entirely.But as it stands, I can't help but give the movie a mild recommendation to longtime fans of Smith and his work. As wonky as the execution may be, the charming cast and good humor made the experience a worthwhile one for me. I laughed at the jokes. I enjoyed the film's more emotional scenes. And I really dug the nostalgic throwbacks to the earlier films. ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot"" might not really be a good film. But it is good fun. And while your mileage may vary, that was enough for me.Strictly as a Kevin Smith fan, I'm giving ""Jay and Silent Bob"" reboot a solid 7 out of 10.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
26,arungeorge13,A somewhat weak nostalgia fest that runs for 100 minutes! [+48%],5,21 October 2021,"The meta, self-referential approach used in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, which features pretty much everyone from Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse, is an uneven mix of hilarious and shrug-worthy. The film gets a bit message-heavy with its (awkwardly emotional) dad-daughter arc but also provides a few occasional laughs along the way. This is one of those ventures where the 5-minute credit outtakes are funnier than what we see unfurl for 100 minutes. It raises the question of why the film couldn't realistically be THAT funny. While it is always refreshing to see Jay and Silent Bob back (even decades later), they could have used a less obvious plot. It was also good to see Affleck reunite with Smith after their brief fallout. The cameos are okayish at best. If you aren't a pop-culture, comic-book, Hollywood franchise fanatic, some (or most) of the one-liners would fail to land. Maybe, Smith should just stick to directing and leave the writing to someone else. And yes, neither do we need his daughter in every movie!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
27,Jeremy_Urquhart,Take it from a big Kevin Smith fan: this is by far his worst film,2,13 November 2020,"The concept on paper is sound, and I genuinely find enjoyment in almost every Kevin Smith movie I've seen... but this was awful.
In 100 or so minutes, there was one kind of funny joke, involving Ben Affleck poking fun at the infamous ""SAVE MARTHAAAAH"" scene from Batman V Superman.But yeah, whatever Smith had in his heyday, I think he's lost it. Everything feels so out of touch and awkward and unfunny, and the occasional attempts at genuine, serious emotional stuff is even less appealing than the numerous failed jokes.Honestly one of the worst comedies I've seen in recent memory. It's hollow, unfunny, far less clever than it thinks it is, and above all else, dull.I would rather defend Cop Out than this- this latest effort from Smith is genuinely worse. I couldn't wait for it to finish, in all honesty, and I've always thought of myself of a Smith fan and defender... but this one didn't work for me at all.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
28,clayface9,I remember when Kevin Smith used to make good movies.,3,16 October 2019,"Oof, this was painful. A movie based entirely on nostalgia for old Kevin Smith movies.

29,RforFilm,Snoogins! Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is both a funny stab at movie reboots and a heartfelt father-daughter story,8,18 October 2019,"If your any kind of film fan, then you would know Kevin Smith. He may be one of Hollywood's biggest geeks, but he's also an exceptional writer who managed to capture a generation X voice in the 1990s with movies like Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy. What's interesting is that not only were they all set in the same universe, but the characters that tied it all together were the drug dealing boys Jay and Silent Bob. They were primary the comedic team that served alongside the main characters, but they also did push the narrative forward whether it was helping Jason Lee in Mallrats or Silent Bob relaying his love story in Chasing Amy to Ben Afleck.They eventually got their own movie in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The movie may have been about them trying to stop Hollywood from making a movie about the characters but it was also about fan entitlement and selling out to the larger movie industry. It's fair to say that it was ahead of it's time before social media would evolve the internet into a debate space. Given that Kevin Smith is usually ahead of the curve, it's nice to see him return the characters in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot to look at more current trends in the industry.In obvious fashion, Jay (played by Jason Mews) and Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith) are arrested after being caught growing their own marijuana. They manage to get the case dropped, but the same lawyer that defended them had also gotten them to sign their likeness and rights to their names to a film company that's producing a reboot of their Bluntman & Chronic movie that was done before in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.After they understand what a reboot is, they vow to get to Hollywood to stop the reboot from happening so they can get their names back. Along the way, Jay comes across his old girlfriend Justice (played by Shannon Elizabeth) who reveals his daughter Millennium Falcon (played by Harley Quinn Smith). He promises not to reveal himself as the father, but when she finds out that the two are going to Hollywood, she makes them take her and her friends too. As the crew makes haste to southern California, Jay starts to understand what it takes to be a father while Millennium Falcon her own dreams with the Bluntman & Chronic reboot.As far as a sequel goes, I can say that Jay and Silent Bob Reboot doesn't disappoint. When you read the plot, it does sound a lot like the old movie and the same kind of mission that these guys are one. It just so happens that Kevin Smith made this. What that means is that the movie is very meta and is self aware about the things being repeated. It's not even that they'll wink to the camera (which happens literally a couple of times), but it's all adding to the theme of growing up as the other ""View Askew"" movies have done. It also happens that the boys are older now.In Kevin Smith's movies, because Jay and Silent Bob are the go-to guys for comedy, they haven't needed the same development from before. This time, Jay does go through an interesting arc on not only what's important for his daughter, but figuring out who he's supposed to be. I can't quite call it a deep explorations, but it's still done in a funny and even touching way. The other character going through her arc is Harley Quinn Smith as Millennium Falcon who may be representing the kind of fans the industry is currently catering to, but she also represents the kind of younger women that Smith used to write for. It's a fascinating look at different generational viewpoints.Does this make the movie better then the original? I'd say the movie has two faults. One is that even though it can be fun to have a variety of other celebrities like Fred Armisen, Matt Damon, Chris Hemsworth, and Jason Lee, but I'd say theres maybe one too many. Some of them contribute to the plot while others feel tacked on. My other problem is that the climax does go on a little longer then it needs to. It's probably a good thing the movie does shift away abruptly (in a funny way I won't spoil).I'll give this eight Quick Stop signs out of ten. It goes without saying that if you've seen Clerks or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back didn't win you over, your not gonna like this. This is made for Kevin Smith fans and those who like to laugh at the movie industry in general. It's a welcome return of the ""View Askewniverse"". Let's hope that Clerks III will come sooner then later. Snoogins!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

The issue has been giving the padding to journey the entire length of the film. I honestly thought Smith might've taken a leaf from the Harold and Kumar series, but sadly not. The best parts of this film are the connections to previous great films. Matt Damon's cameo was short, but hilarious. Ben Affleck returning to provide an incredible short scene that adds so much to Chasing Amy, was amazing. Smith clearly has the ability to create emotional and comedy beats, but chooses not to. The cast is amazing, but the overall film is flat. I wouldn't ignore Clerks III, Mallrats II, or Dogma II, but this series has run its course in my opinion. This had strong moments followed by so many flat segments. It's a mixed bag.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was a guilty pleasure of mine and actually quite enjoyable. I could barely follow this or what was even going on. I enjoyed some of the nods to previous work and cameos, but that was seemingly all that held the show together.It tried really hard to get sentimental, and I don't think it actually succeeded. It did succeed in making me want to rewatch Clerks though. Kevin Smith has already proven he's a great writer - just didn't need this added to his filmography.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

34,MrDHWong,Provides a solid amount of fanservice for long time Kevin Smith devotees but offers little to nothing else for newcomers,7,6 August 2020,"Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is the seventh live action installment of Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse. Written and directed by the man himself, Kevin Smith, it provides a solid amount of fanservice for long time devotees to his films but offers little to nothing else for newcomers.In New Jersey, veteran drug dealers Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) lose the rights to use their real names in a court case involving Hollywood's soon-to-be-released reboot film about the characters ""Bluntman and Chronic"", whom the duo are based on. The two later learn from their friend Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) that one final scene in the movie is to be shot in three days time at ""Chronic-Con"", a large gathering of Bluntman and Chronic fans in Los Angeles, California. Determined to stop the movie from being completed and regain the rights to use their names, the pair depart from their hometown and head for Hollywood.The films of Kevin Smith have often been a good topic of discussion among geeks, stoners, and film watchers alike due the unique way in which he implements all of these personal passions of his into a cinematic format. Some find it amusing to see how Smith can get away with taking jabs at the very things he enjoys without coming across as too self-deprecating or hateful. ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot"" follows suit with not only an amusing send-up of Smith's very own View Askewniverse (named for his production company ""View Askew Productions""), but also of reboots in general. From the very beginning, the film is entirely aware that it is following a near-identical plot to Smith's 2001 film ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", with many jokes about how lazy and unoriginal Hollywood has become in recent years simply wishing to milk older franchises for all their money's worth instead of trying something original. These jokes did feel very hit-and-miss as the film went on, with some bordering on cheap toilet and sexual humour, but the ones that did hit managed to hit hard. I often found myself laughing out loud at several of the self-referencial shots taken at the longevity of some of the characters and their situations, with one young girl remarking that ""these guys have been around since the 90s, BEFORE the internet!"" being one that makes me chuckle just thinking about it.Of course, to truly appreciate something like this, one must at least be familiar with Smith's previous View Askewniverse movies. Despite having ""Reboot"" in the title, it doesn't always feel like one. There are so many inside jokes and references to ""Clerks"", ""Mallrats"", ""Chasing Amy"", and ""Dogma"" that they make up the core of this film's very existence, giving little to no backstory to unfamiliar viewers. Naturally, I am biased in this regard as I enjoyed watching all of these films during my teenage years, with ""Clerks"" still being my personal favourite of the bunch, which I consider to be one of the most amusing comedies I have seen to date. However, it would be near impossible for an uninitiated Kevin Smith film audience to find anything entertaining, aside from the aforementioned digs at Hollywood and their incessant need to reboot old movies. That's not to say novices won't be able to follow the film entirely, it's just that almost all of the best jokes and references will fly right over their heads, much to their annoyance.It's a bittersweet feeling seeing both Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith reprising their roles as Jay and Silent Bob, respectively after a quarter of a century since their debut. The now middle-aged actors don't look anywhere near convincing as youthful druggies any more but that's all part of the joke I guess. One thing that certainly hasn't waned in age is their comic timing, with Mewes' quick wit and Smith's mute reactions still providing some good laughs when required. The rest of the cast, which includes View Askewniverse alumni Jason Lee, Brian O'Halloran, and even Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, of whom they all owe their entire careers to Smith, also look noticeably older from when I can remember last seeing them in their earlier films. With that said, it's still a nice touch on Smith's behalf that he managed to get all of them to appear here and acknowledge their roots. Additionally, the film also features Smith's real life daughter Harley Quinn Smith in a major supporting role. It is quite fun to see the now grown-up actress acting alongside her father in one of his movies and she is clearly having great fun reading the dialogue he has written for her.While it certainly won't win over any new fans, this film still feels like a return to form for Kevin Smith after years of mediocre to terrible projects like Cop Out and Yoga Hosers. Reportedly, there is a sequel to Mallrats on the horizon so anyone needing another View Askewniverse fix have that to look forward to. In that regard, I can only quote what the titular duo would say: ""Snoochie Boochies!""I rate it 6.5/10",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

41,Donatien3,One for the Fans,8,25 January 2020,"Nearly twenty years after ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", this 'reboot' is so meta it almost becomes self-indulgent. Almost.The plot is relatively simple: Jay (Jason Mewes) and Slient Bob (Kevin Smith) stupidly sign their rights to their names to a sneaky lawyer (Justin Long) and travel to Hollywood to stop the gritty Bluntman and Chronic reboot and get their names back. It's quite similar to ""Strike Back"", (including a repeat of the 'why are people watching this?' straight-to-camera joke) which is the point.Kevin Smith (playing both himself and Silent Bob) doesn't miss any targets: making fun of himself; his heart attack and massive weight loss; his old movies; the lazy Hollywood reboot/remake culture; his habit of casting his daughter Harley Quinn in his movies (she's also in this one); the need to make modern movies more diverse; podcasting; so on and so forth.There's a huge cast, including Shannon Elizabeth, Val Kilmer, Redman and Method Mad, Rosario Dawson, Stan Lee, Ben Affleck, Rosario Dawson, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Lee, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Craig Robinson, Fred Armisen, Diedrich Bader, Joe Manganiello, and Chris Hemsworth.Typical of Smith's movies, it gets a little sentimental towards the end, but it's not too as bad as some of his previous films.Fans of Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse movies (""Clerks"" onwards) will adore this, as there's a million references for them to catch.

43,patriciogl10,Jay and Silent Bob disappoint.,5,12 February 2020,"I couldn't escape the hype I felt for this film, being a Kevin Smith fan and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back being one of my favourite comedies of all time. But this sequel/reboot/whatever certainly tried, but it just wasn't up to par. Some jokes were timed greatly, and appropriately for genuine laughs, the obvious nods to the Hollywood cultural industry sometimes striked as awkward and uninspiring. The sentimental father/daughter central theme of the film worked only to a certain extent; there are passages on the film where it looks like everyone is just trying too hard, that it feels unnatural and interrupts the flow of the film, unlike Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back which was impeccable in that aspect, even though it was also imbuid with tongue-in-cheek dramatic absurdity.Despite many of its flaws, I still enjoyed this film, seeing familiar faces and iconic lines from the previous film, was a rather pleasant experience. Which is why is kind of upsetting that Reboot isn't what Strike Back was and meant for me when I first saw it back in the day. Sadly one creates too much expectation in products that while I'm sure was done with so much love and passion from Mr. Smith, it lacked the creative effort he put on Strike Back in 2001.It was great to see Jason Mewes back on track, both with Reboot and also his appreciable directorial debut, Madness in the Method, which integrally, I believe it is a much more solid effort than this. Without all the nostalgia factor, the numerous cool references to Strike Back and the entertainment industry in general and all the cameos from different celebrities, this film would be a rather poor enterprise, an unimaginative and utter disappointment. So, pretty much those elements I mentioned earlier are what saves this film from being a

You also need to have recently screened JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK, which this film mimics. Smith's goal was to satirize reboots while simultaneously being one. He misses the mark. The film also allows Jason Mewes to have a meaningful, dramatic plot.

A simple but fun story makes this one of Kevin Smiths best and is up there with Chasing Amy and Dogma for me as the highlights of the ViewAskew.Seeing Jay and Silent Bob together again is amazing and so nostalgic for me and this movie ties in everything really well and Kevin has wrote a brilliant script that is smart and a great homage to work that Kevin has done before.This movie follows on really well from Jay and Silent Bob but also manages to follow on from all the ViewAskew universe movies and the fans will love it for that.My only issue is that it is basically the same story as Strikes Back and that really stands out it dosent ruin the movie but it definitely stands out to me. It does do stuff different but just wish it was more.Like the idea of Jay of having kid and there some really emotional moments with that between him and his daughter. And it's a great way to move the story forward and add something different.
It also makes for a great third act with Jay realising that he needs to grow up.My Favourite moment is definitely the call back to Chasing Amy seeing Ben Affleck in these movies again was awesome and it added closure to my favourite movie in this universe Chasing Amy it was such a fantastic moment and happy Kevin Smith added this moment in because it added alot of heart to Chasing Amy.Verdict 8.9/10 a fantastic and my second favourite movie in the ViewAskew still enjoy Chasing Amy more but this is a great homage and fantastic closure to ViewAskew.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
48,TuesdayThe17th,😐 I am not amewesd,2,7 April 2020,"Jay and Silent Bob reboot starts off with an oddly random scene that is supposed to make us laugh. This scene, however, was incredibly dumb and far from funny. This opening scene was actually the most action you will see the entire movie besides the childish fake shoot out in the ending. This movie has a made for TV type of filter yet its budget is quite large and there is a serious lack of extras and where they are placed causing the realism to drop to an all time low.. It is the same budget that Fede Alvarez had to work with on 2013's ""Evil Dead""... Hmmmm..... lol. The cast here is also awful as it seems the budget went to paying high end actors to have single scene cameos that make up almost the whole run time. It's sad to me to see Smith create such a lackluster movie after hyping it up so much but honestly what else would one expect after his recent contributions with the slight exception of ""Tusk"" and definitely not including his best film to date, ""Red State"". ""Red State"" is Smith's most serious movie and it leaves me scratching my head as to why he hasn't done more like this for his true film fans. I don't know why everything has to be an advertisement for his products.. This is movie making not ad marketing... With all this being said, I am quite happy with the performance of Jay and Silent Bob even though they seemed a bit tired. Its nice to see Jason Mewes back on his feet and ready to take on the world as I have met them both and I can relate with some stuff Mewes went through. There is also a heartwarming father/daughter story at the helm of this movie between Jay and Smith's own pride and joy, Harley Quinn. This, too, is an element I appreciate because I have a daughter who is my whole world. In a way this is a ""dad"" movie but unfortunately, yet again, Kevin Smith fails to deliver a memorable or even good for that matter film.. I hope he finds his way back to a more serious tone of filmmaking as I believe Kevin Smith could craft several more great horror films if he really wanted to.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

51,torrascotia,Well we are all 20 years older....,4,11 January 2020,"I had been looking forward to this for quite some time. At the time I really enjoyed the first Jay and Silent Bob movie. But I was 20 years younger. Having watched the first clips of the new movie I was struck by how old the cast looked and also how jarring this type of humour seemed coming from a cast in their 50s. The current 90s nostalgia trend to reboot movies from the 90's /early 00's is a tricky one. Directors need to balance nostalgia with enough new content to not make it feel like a cash in copy. While I get that Kevin Smith was poking fun at reboots and himself in the movie, I just didnt feel as satisfied watching this as the initial outing. But thats likely down to the fact the audience from the first movie will have matured and moved on. Its seems that this was a movie for his uberfans who are still steeped in nerd culture, read the same comic they did when they were 20, despite being in their 40s or 50s and consume his numerous podcasts which are full of insider jokes. For them this may be a higher rated movie. The most enjoyable part for me was getting a glimpse of what could have been How High 2 with Redman and Method Man. One of the many (many) cameos in this movie. This may appeal to a younger audience as it does go a bit ""woke"" and ""diverse"", its unlikely to have the same cult success as the first movie, simply because people tend to grow out of stoner jokes and this brand of humour.

As others have said, buried somewhere in this mess was a great film.I honestly don't understand why the director Kevin Smith can do films with such heart, and then turn around and do some bat sh** nonsense like this movie. Clerks 2, and even Dogma for it's ridiculous plot, proves that Kevin Smith can do bonkers stuff in a film, and still have it ""matter"". This film is not those films.I'll preface the rest of this review to note I've seen every single Kevin Smith film, so I understand when's he's great and when he's shooting blanks, and Reboot is definitely the latter, unfortunately, for the most part.First of all, the biggest problem with this film is the incredible heavy-handed-ness of the jokes themselves. There are parts of the film where Kevin Smith might as well be screaming at the screen saying ""This is the part where you should be laughing."" Yeah, we get it, jokes. You don't need the actors hamming it up staring at the screen. Oh, you broke the fourth wall, neat. Too bad they do it again and again.Including Kevin's real-life daughter in a critical role was a fatal flaw for the film, because she simply cannot act. There's probably a reason she only gets cast in his films...hmmm.I am giving it 2 stars only because there are moments of utter brilliance in the film, hinting at what it could have been, and are really wonderful for nostalgic reasons alone.That being said, I can only recommend this film to those who will go see Clerks 3 when it eventually comes out, as there is an obvious bridge to that film when it happens. Hopefully Kevin Smith remembers what made Clerks 2 great once upon a time, when he makes 3, because this film was a poor showing in the Askewniverse.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

55,nikitalinivenko,Kevin Smith Fan Service - TO THE MAX!,5,7 February 2020,"Here, it is, what we've all waited for, the extended cinematic universe crossover event of the year - the View Askewniverse! I enjoyed this more than Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and I got some good laughs relatively often, but this only really works if you're a big Kevin Smith fan and have seen his other movies. The whole movie is Smith riffing on himself (cue shots at Cop Out), reboots, remakes, Comic Book culture, and constant callbacks to Dogma (Matt Damon makes a completely random cameo as Loki in a scene that comes out of nowhere and serves no purpose, throws out a few Bourne Identity puns, and is never seen again), Clerks, Strike Back, Chasing Amy, etc. The Bluntman and Chronic movie from Strike Back is being rebooted (Bluntman V. Chronic), and Jay and Silent Bob can't use their names because the production company copyrighted them. So they go back to Hollywood to crash Chronic-Con and confront Kevin Smith. Along the way, Jay discovers he has a daughter (played by Kevin Smith's daughter) and she and her multi-ethnic friends tag along; hijinks ensue (including a scene where Jay rescues the girls from the KKK while Bob distracts them with the Alec Baldwin speech from Glengarry Glen Ross), and the whole movie becomes a cameo showcase - the regular Smith cast all pop up (Brian O'Halloran still working at Quick-Stop) as well as Fred Armison as an Uber driver (here called Ride Me), Red Man and Method Man, an old Val Kilmer briefly sneaks in there, Chris Hemsworth as a hologram). The main plot is a McGuffin (literally, in the end it fades to Jay and Silent Bob hanging outside the Quick-Stop with Jay's new daughter, and the whole plot is suddenly dropped and literally nothing from it resolved) it just serves as an excuse for Jay to learn to be a father (and Smith by proxy to reflect on fatherhood in his own trite, cliche, goofy way) against a backdrop of dropped references, guest appearances and stoner antics. Reboot is an intentionally dumb, self-aware meta parody of itself with a random plot that doesn't hold together (another reviewer pointed out this is intentional to make fun of the stupidity of reboots) and for a casual viewer will undoubtedly be throwaway and displosable, while hardcore Kevin Smith fans might get what they came for, or at the very least will be able to appreciate all the inside jokes.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
56,Rino_Bortone,"EXHILARATING, EVEN IF SOMETHING'S MISSING",6,26 January 2020,"Let's face it: Jay and Silent Bob will always be our neighborhood heroes, the real ones. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is a good film, without any aspiration, even it's not comparable to some pearls as the previous films, but it certainly aims to be the parody of itself, but maybe in the most original way of the term. Beyond every negative critisism that just find its way in the mainstream statement ""I'll follow the mass"", the word / concept ""REBOOT"" is totally nailed, because beyond the little / short plot, this movie is a self-parody just because it is about rebooting Jay and Silent Bob and Smith just centres the point with no-sense scenes that go in and out continuosly, confusing the spectator as a reboot (a bad one) does most of the time. Grasped the concept? No? To sum up: it's sarcasm at its finest. Funny, hilarious enough and with a veiled important message dementially-expressed as it has to be.

57,boris_unanimate,One of the Worst & Dumbest Movies of 2019,3,1 June 2020,"This wasn't a movie. This was basically repeating or finishing entire storylines from his previous interconnected movies. Making self-aware meta jokes just isn't clever or funny when there are no jokes and punchlines. Well, the overarching punchline is Kevin Smith is a hack and every single one of his movie post-Red State was a dumpster fire because he doesn't care about making movies anymore, just picking up a paycheck. This one is no different, it's worse. It's lazy, unfunny and tedious to get through. Avoid at all costs!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
58,Dannyboi94,What the heck was that?,2,27 January 2020,"Jay and Silent Bob 2001, is one of my all time favourite comedy films. It was a blast from start to finish, this movie, is utter trash. I did not laugh once throughout the runtime, and found myself wanting to stop watching. How did this fail so much? The first was hilarious, with great chemistry between Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, here, they don't have even the slightest bit of on-screen chemistry they once had. We all know they are friends in real life, but what happened here? It's like they were sleepwalking through the film, and didn't care about what they were doing. I know these films are not supposed to be taken seriously, but they could at least be fun to watch, this is not.The movie does have a few smart cameos, but other than that, there is nothing good to say about this film. It lacked any creativity the first one had, had no comedy, was poorly written, and was just plain boring. I can't believe the film sucked that bad. I loved the first one so much, that I wished I hadn't even watched this.2/10",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
59,questiontheauthorities,Kevin Smith's money leaves him out of touch with his original fanbase,1,15 January 2020,"Kevin Smith follows the herd trend of 'no original ideas--reboot and rehash existing franchises only' sweeping (and rapidly bankrupting) hollywood studios everywhere.
Just announced a Clerks 3 and Mallrats sequel. These films are 30 years old. The audiences are 30 years older.
You're just riding the familiarity of a household name and you know it.
And so do the fans. We stopped watching this trend as it sadly continues to unfold, and bankrupt more and more hollywood studios out of existence forever.
Pretty soon broadcast networks will follow suit because they didn't start streaming soon enough, and we'll be forced to watch Netflix owned, filmed, and limited-to-streaming-only content whether or not we want to, or revert to portable media now that it's already been phased out for the better part of 10 years.That's what I'm doing anyway. Thankfully I won't live long enough to re-watch all 325 of my blurays and DVDs. I even still have a VCR thank God for the titles that got censored after being released to new media formats (language, nudity cropping, etc) still being untouched in their original formats.

60,jcslawyer,Painful but still fun...,5,1 April 2020,"I love Kevin Smith movies. J&SB Strike Back is awesome and Clerks 2 was hilarious. This was an unnecessary attempt to bring a sense of nostalgia to an already overexposed sense of nostalgia that we see today. The jokes were all done before, it didn't really introduce anything to the universe. I actually liked the emotional side as it showed a little depth to a character whose antics are tired.The F word is overused. The story is borderline lame. But, when it comes down to it, by the time the credits roll, it's still fun fodder. I probably won't buy this or want to watch again.Expect it to be a montage of Kevin's portfolio with jokes that we've heard time and time again. I didn't laugh out loud except for a few times....and it wasn't more than a split sec. some things made me all cringy...like watching some old weird vaudeville actor doing his hobo bit for a fraternity.I gave it the score bc I ultimately didn't hate it and don't regret seeing the film.

64,veinctor,Needs background research before you watch it,6,5 December 2019,"The characters of this movie come and go, as Jay and silent Bob go a self-aware roadtrip, that supposedly mocks Hollywood and all recent reboots, as it passes fatherhood messages. In the end is a homage and revisitation to the director's (Kevin Smith) old works and his best friend Jason Mewes.Jay and SIlent Bob is the 7th film of Kevin Smiths ""View Askewniverse"". You need to see at least Chasing Amy and Dogma to get most cameos and jokes. I was always interesting in that universe but I had hard time remember Ben Afflec's character, since he plays at least 2 characters in that universe. So yeah, it's confusing even for those who done their studies. And there are other camoes, like Maaatt Daaamon who appeared just to tell us what happened to his character after the end of movie ""Dogma"".Other than that. Kevin has his wife and daughter in the movie, and Jason Mewes daughter, and they talk about them selves, they talk about their characters (Jay and silent Bob) and they talk about characters based on their characters ""Bluntman and Chronic"". Again, it can be confusing. Even watching the original Jay and silent Bob (which I love a lot!), I had hard time understanding Bluntman and Chronic, because I felt like there was a comic or a series that I was unaware of. I still dont know if such a thing exists, but I wish there was a movie about them.This movie even has references to non-View Askewniverse, such as Batman being Bruce Wayne (Justice League movie) and Cop Out, a Kevin Smith movie where he had trouble with Bruce Willis. Kevin never stops satirizing himself and his own work, as his own daughter tells us that he puts he in every movie he makes. I have no clue why Val Kilmer was in the movie though, and I'm kind of sad that they didn't include Mark Hamil again. After all Mark Hamil was the Joker in Batman TAS and Kevin's daughter is named Harley Quinn and those 2 supervillains are all the rage.. yeah, so much background info for such a small silly movie!All in all, this movie feels like Kevin's last movie (since he had a heart attack as he tells us in the movie). He added in everything he could as a self induced fan-service. He made a movie about himself and Jason Mewes, mostly for himself and Jason. I'm surprised that he never mention in the movie how he directed a season's final episode of The Flash and shoehorned Jason Mewes in there.Don't watch this movie for the story. It goes nowhere, as seemingly important characters just vanish, never to be seen again (Shannon Elizabeth's character is the mother of Jay's daughter, but we never find out how she takes the fact that Jay told her daughter that he is the father). Don't watch this movie for the jokes because you won't get most of them (check Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back instead).Watch this movie if you are a Kevin Smith fan, or you want to be his fan. Or if you like 90's jokes and mockumentries. Or if you are 40-50 years old. This is a movie coming out of Kevin's fear of death, and that's the message of the movie. How to become a good father if you are a selfish person.Come to think of it, this movie also serves as a huge lesson to Jason Mewes, and Kevin tries once more to help him out. It's not a secret and probaly know more than I should, but Jason had a drug problem and Kevin was trying for years to help him. Jason even stole from Kevin for drugs. But Kevin is such a good friend that tried to clean Jason and that's why he put him in The Flash, to motivate him. So yeah, this movie is full of heart behind the scenes and Kevin is a very lovable guy. If you follow Kevin's work and commentary for as many years as I have, you can't help yourself but feel like you are his friend.Kevin, do a Bluntman and Chronic movie man! And don't cry over The Flash finales! And I'm sad we are all getting older, it sucks.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Pretty fun movie. Never really bored.

Acting was actually very good.Cons:
Dropped the ball at some points, could've been pretty close to good as the first, but missed the mark too often. You'll notice.Too much politics injected into it.

Honestly it's a good movie if you have absolutely nothing else to do. I would recommend watching it for the celebrity cameos and jay was actually really enjoyable.

66,ThatMonkey,Jay and Silent Bob Chit Themselves,1,26 January 2020,"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a magical film. It ties together the Viewaskew Universe while providing a Forest Gump style look back at all Kevin Smith films. It also introduced us to a lot of legendary talent past, present and future.This Reboot proves that Smith has truly lost his way. Red State, Tusk, & Yoga Hosers prove that Scott Mosier was the true talent in that duo. The fact that Scott didn't sign on for this shows that he didn't see the value in this project and judging by the fact that no one wanted to finance this film proves that Hollywood had no faith in this project.The story for this film was actually a good idea, but the script and execution was terrible and Kevin's talentless, unattractive daughter was in no way capable or qualified to co start on this project. For the past year, Kevin has been bragging about all the cameos in this film, but anyone attached to this should be deeply embarrassed and after a decade or more long separation between Kevin and Ben, this was an unfortunate reunion for two guys who made a handful of classic films.This was the worst film I have seen in a long while and if anyone else is giving this guy money to make movies, you are just encouraging failed film making.I think Kevin needs to stop trying to be the face of comic books and IMDB and get back to his roots of original, unparalleled script writing, because this movie needs it's diaper changed!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

68,Eric266,For Jay and Silent Bob Fans Only,6,2 April 2020,"I love these characters, but Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is almost as lame and unfunnny as some of the reboots they are mocking. Most of the jokes are rehashes from the other movies and the only real reason to watch is for the fun cameos from previous movies such as Jason Lee (Mallrats), Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy), Brian O'Hallaran (Mallrats, Clerks, Clerks II), Shannon Elizabeth (Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back) and even Rosario Dawson, playing a different role unrelated to her character in Clerks II. There are a couple of really hilarious cameos by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon that almost make the rest of the movie worth watching.Jay and Silent Bob learn there is a reboot being made of Bluntman and Chronic (the movie based on the comic based on them from Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back. Ouch, that sentence was hard to write). So, they again travel across country to Hollywood to stop the film being made by the real Kevin Smith (played by Kevin Smith) who they keep referring to as Kevin James. Along the way they run into Jay's former girlfriend, Justice, who has a kid (played by Kevin Smith's real life daughter) and her three very odd female friends. Unlike JASBSB or Dogma, the road aspect of this movie falls flat at almost every set piece. Fred Armison as an Uber-type driver is totally wasted. They eventually get into ""Chronic Con"", a Comic Con knockoff where a scene for the reboot is being filmed.There is a Clerks 25-year reunion interview panel at the fake convention, but its a blink-and-you-will-miss-it moment. Its a shame they didn't have more screen time as I had to rewind it and pause just to see who was on the panel. Sadly, Lisa Spoonauer who played Dante's ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn, passed away in 2017 and could not be on the panel. Additionally, neither Jeff Anderson nor his character, Randall, from Clerks and Clerks II appear in the movie. Apparently Anderson and Smith had a falling out, but they've patched things up so that Anderson will appear in Clerks III.As mentioned above, there are two hilarious cameos by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Damon appears as Loki, sitting in a church, explaining to the audience what has happened to him since Dogma. He makes some pretty well placed zingers about Loki from the Marvel movies as well as his Bourne identity...get it. Affleck's cameo is even more impressive as its both hilarious and touching. His Bankie discusses becoming a father and how he used to feel like Bruce Wayne, but with a kid, he now sees things from Thomas Wayne's perspective. I won't ruin the jokes, but the double meaning behind Bankie's words and Affleck's real life time playing Bruce Wayne/Batman are funny as hell...complete with a knowing look to the audience.I really wanted to like this movie, but the subplot with Justice's daughter was heavy-handed and monotonous. Ms. Smith overacted the rebellious teenager role as well. The jokes were retreads and not very funny. Hopefully, Smith rebounds with Clerks III and gets back to the hilarity of those characters. Perhaps having Jay and Silent Bob as supporting characters is the real way to go.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

There is a lot of payoff from previous films in the verse, which is nostalgic. But it doesn't add up to more than the sum of its parts, due to a paper thin under thought out plot. It Can't decide if it's a goofy comedy or a sappy drama. It's really funny when it hits but often it falls flat for some reason. It's meta to the point of ruining suspension of disbelief and feels too focused on trying to tie up and include bits from previous films but arbitrarily so. The cameos and many scenes don't flow like a cohesive film. It has moments where it's really fun, but also long stretches where its slow and just didn't work for me. Ultimately disappointing. It could have used another few drafts certainly. Jay makes the film, he's pretty spot on and even adds levity to the slow emotional father subplot. He's in top form. Overall it's just too meandering and anticlimactic. It's too light on the depth in the emotional scenes and too light on action and comedy in the goofy parts. Further proof Smith lost perspective on this flic, the magically funny outtakes in the credits would have much better served as beats in the actual film, but it almost feels like he threw them in to distract us and make us forget how flat most of the film is.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Guest stars abound, there are very few welcomed surprises. Loosely reused & abused Mallrats/Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back plot...plenty of inside jokes reference this fact & acknowledge it with humor but it lands flat and unfunny. Needs a lot more attention to editing, unnecessarily long transition spots & plenty of material that could've/should've been left on the ""cutting room floor"".The movie truly does feel like an earnest attempt to play to the subculture of fans that enjoyed the earlier Clerks movies but this ""love letter"" to the fans reads more like a break up note. Characters have not grown or matured significantly such as in Clerks 2 which was surprisingly good and loyal to the movie that inspired it. In Jay, you have an adolescent minded goofball & has behaved so throughout the course of the series & then all of a sudden there's a ""growth spurt"" or a ""parental instinct"" when a certain someone is introduced into his life? I dunno...There ARE some nice scenes in the movie, VERY few of them, but you'll know them when/if you see them.Kevin Smith> there is FAR too much mugging and pantomiming in the Silent Bob role, far FAR beyond the levels demonstrated in earlier works. The surly, quietly confident, laid-back stoner from the earlier movies would destroy the current emoji using, over emotive goof. His antics grow tired & old VERY quickly early on in the movie and very nearly destroy this avoidable movie. Kevin Smith appears to have gone completely showbiz and looks to be a major ""mark"" for himself> it seems he's only capable of regurgitating or reprising earlier works for an easy payday. To be absolutely fair & impartial, his child does a very good job in the film with the material she's been given & I'd be curious to see what else she can do in a different style movie with a different director.I watched Clerks & Mallrats incessantly ""back in the day""> I could quote those movies backward & forward, I love THOSE films (Clerks 2 is fantastic also). I tried my best to keep my expectations low when viewing this movie. This movie will please some but more will be turned off by the shark-jumping ""woke"" moments that are more regressive than they are ""progressive""",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

This film stays true to the series. The humor is what you would expect and isn't for everyone, but is definitely for me. Its also really cool to see the return of some big name actors and so many guest appearances. I would highly recommend this film if you didn't get the chance to see it earlier tonight on the 15th then go and see it the 17th if tickets are still available. I also believe that this film is great as a parody, you'll understand if you see it and has some of the best jokes of the series, I was non stop laughing through the entire film.

Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is a sequel to 2001's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Where Strike Back was legitimate road movie with a few in jokes built in, Reboot is one big in joke, with a little bit of a plot peppered in and out at various points. If you look at it as a love letter to fans, then I guess it's a no harm/no foul type of situation.

She plays an overly aggressive person, not a good actress at all.The whole movie is pretty much a carbon copy of the original, except approx 20 years later.Some fun bits in for any comic/scifi fan but the majority sucked.Kevin Smith is a decent director and writes Comic books and Comic Book movies pretty good but this Askenview verse is pretty boring.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

And as for the ppl who say that Jay and Silent Bob ""go woke"" or ""PC"", are you alright? Have you watched other Smith's movies? Like from 90s and stuff, perhaps Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or literary any other one? They sure were very patriarchal and heteronormative, and neither touched topic of racism in any way, yup, that's totally true. Kevin Smith goes ""woke"", everyone, big news, never been there, what a surprising turn of events.
What I also like about this movie - it is filmed very well. Seriously, I love how it's written, I love the jokes, the acting, the cinematography, the plot. I also love how the Evil Russians are portrayed: accent is quite believable and they don't talk in very bad imitation of Russian language, as it sometimes happens in American movies (and tends to be quite irritating).

I can't remember the last time I turned a movie off about 15 minutes into it, but I saw where it was going. I've seen most of Kevin Smith's other work and found it spotty, but there were some I really liked. This was a movie made for him and his friends. Lots of callbacks, (bad) improv and very poor editing.I made it to the point where they got to Chicago, and Mooby's. Painfully unfunny.Jay was cool and unique 20 years ago. Now that he's a lot older his shtik is mostly pathetic. Great that he cleaned himself up, though. Smith looks better here than he did in any of the other J&SB movies, so they've both come a long ways.

I had sympathy for Dante and Randall in Clerks 2, because getting old sucks.

You have to stay focused to get all non-stop movie references, puns, and to recognize the (mostly) aging ensemble actors and actresses in their seemingly endless cameos. It really is a hoot.

Cinemark
10/17/19I would not call myself a Kevin Smith apologist, because you shouldn't ever have to apologize for loving what you love, if you believe there is merit and you connect to someone's work, forget apologizing for it. I love Kevin Smith, he is one of my main idols in life, he's inspired me to create my own podcasts, start writing scripts and start directing films of my own. I've met him multiple times, seen his various live, traveling shows and know his films front to back. So of course, when Fathom announces a Jay and Silent Bob Grindhouse I gotta go, we caught a double header of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and it's 18 years later sequel Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. This time around Jay and his hetero life mate Silent Bob must go back to Hollywood to stop the superhero reboot of the franchise based on their likeness: Bluntman and Chronic. This time the journey has them discovering there is more to life than comics, weed and movies.The verdict?My first reactions after the movie were generally positive. I knew what I was getting into: tons of cameos, breaking the 4th wall, and most of all frequent callbacks to the View Askew-niverse, the world in which all of Kevin Smith's films and characters live in. We get references to pretty much every single one of his movies from Clerks and Clerks II to less cherished favorites such as Jersey Girl and Tusk (both of which I absolutely love). The Dogma scene with Matt Damon is hilarious but the one that caught me off guard as having an emotional impact was Chasing Amy. Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams reprise their roles and actually perform here. Seeing what these characters are doing 22 years later truly hit me, Affleck delivers a wonderfully stirring and believable monologue about love and family and death, which was expertly penned by Smith. It was those few moments that prove how talented of a writer he is.Jason Mewes in the title role of Jay gives a great performance. It's impressive to see his growth from ""Strike Back"" to seeing how his characters adapts to a film in 2019. As I said before the film gets emotional at times and seeing him show depth as an actor was incredibly impressive, I like where Jay's life is headed. Also, incredibly good was Harley Quinn Smith, Kevin's daughter. She has skill and talent and she's so young. I am curious to see what her future has in store for her as she does not need to stay in her dad's flicks, she has the chops to do this on her own. She also starred in a small role in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, this year. This performer is going places.My issues with the film flushed out during an after-movie discussion with a friend. Of course not all the jokes land, but it's rare a comedy has a 100% delivery, that's not the real issue. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is grounded in reality. Whereas Strike Back, has tons over the top fantastical moments such as a run in with Scooby-Doo and the gang in the Mystery Machine, a wild Planet of the Apes segment, and physics defying action sequences to name a few. These set up the wacky world this movie inhibits and are frankly hilarious. They work because these characters are such larger than life caricatures, they're so ridiculous, that the unbelievable, zany stuff going around them makes a lot of sense. Reboot doesn't follow those tropes, the movie is surprisingly reserved and real, and that feels a little less fun and exciting. One of the craziest highlights of Reboot is Jay and Silent Bob crashing a KKK rally (led by a clan leader played by 2000's WWF sensation Chris Jericho) but other than that and a few moments in the conclusion of the film, it really occupies a grounded 2019. And reality is just not where Jay and Bob are at their best; that said, the great performances from Mewes and Harley Quinn make that realness work. I really think the film would've benefited if Smith kept the emotional resonance from the performances and got a little crazier with the hijinks Jay, Bob and the crew of misfit young friends they meet along the way, find themselves in.It was awesome to see characters reunited from some of my all-time favorite movies; it's the main reason to see this flick but the reason to stay is the emotional depth and good performances. Watching them back to back was a great night, flooded with memories of laughing with friends and family through the years gave me some nostalgic experiences I didn't expect and made me incredibly excited to see what Smith would do with the recently announced Clerks III.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
125,SinisterTwist,Bland rehash of old jokes,5,20 March 2020,"I used to love Kevin Smith's work. Then around Clerks 2 I just sort of fell out of the fandom. This reminds me why.Too much of the movie's humor relies on you remembering his other, better work, rather than really taking advantage of the satirical possibilities of reboots and fan culture. I mean, how fun would it have been for the movie to focus on Jay and Silent Bob discovering and traveling to the film convention in order to generally take advantage of the fandom? Then while they're there, he has to deal with the idea of the toxic fandom as well as cancel culture because some people think that they're too offensive nowadays. Meanwhile they have to deal with the changes that tend to come with reboots, some of which make sense and others that don't. Not to mention changes that aren't actually changes... yet the studio pretends that they are.The movie isn't unwatchable, but it's just disappointing since it doesn't take advantage of the possibilities while also sanitizing everything.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

127,mcgill_j,Mostly the GOOD.. there's a bit of bad and ugly too...,7,17 October 2019,"Ok.. first off the top let's get this out there. This film is clearly a LOW budget affair. Just watching it.. it feels there are large seams in it.. and up through the middle just feels at times like an odd collection of ""bits"" loosely stitched together, some work better than others. There's other things for me even as a LONG LONG time fan don't quite work.. but, in the end? Much more of the film works than doesn't. And.. you even have this flick make you roll a tear or three by the end .. that's pretty good for a Jay and Silent Bob movie I'd say.Kevin and Jay slip back into their characters almost seamlessly.. not THAT much has really changed.. although with the nature of the ""smartphone"" Bob now has a much more fun and expressive way to communicate, some of those bits do come through better than others. Other bits may depend on how you feel about the performers.. Molly Shannon and Fred Armisen for example are very hit and, mostly, big MISS for me.. so those scenes really dragged the film down (for my taste).The entire middle section though has some sequences that work, but really are more for the hardcore fans.. example being the jokes about Smith and his new ""vegan"" (post heart attack) life style.. connecting together characters from Smith's other film ""Yoga Hosers"" (and actually earlier in the film even ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"") to this film. The scene in Mooby's with Kate Micucchi made me laugh.. as did the button on the scene with Bob and the manager ""Miss Mackenzie (the character from ""Yoga Hosers"", played by Smith's real life wife).I think more than anything what I've grown to appreciate and enjoy from his work is hit big.. let's join the circus, all get together and put on a show mentality. Get your friends.. get a camera.. get the family and let's all go. Over 25 years the family in Smith's world has grown quite large though. With several actors not only having played several roles, and some reprising them here, but literal family members showing up on camera.As I said the film is very clearly a low budget affair. Comparing to ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" there were several set pieces and action sequences while not huge did serve to piece the film together, that could have served the movie here.But.. other things.. like ""Milly's theme"" by Smith's trusty James L. Venable is clearly inspired by John Williams theme for Princess Leia in Star Wars.. callbacks to music cues from previous films.. and the entire third act that, while Smith mocks ""Return of the King"" and the entire LOTR series in ""Clerks 2"", this film very much does feel like that curtain call thorughout.. showing what happened to so many of the characters. I won't name which ones, although from the announced cast I am sure you can guess many.But what's the most surprising at the end of the day? This film is more about family.. and even manages to bring out some genuine sweet emotion to it. Its creaky in pieces and parts.. and it truly SUCKS that I can't give this a second or third watch to really review this better but that is owed to the release strategy and not the fault of Smith and co. PLUS.. for the hardcore fans? This film solves a 25 year old mystery that until the conclusion of the film never knew I NEEDED to know.This is definitely a worthy followup to his previous entries. It's not quite as sharp.. but his dialogue is always is on point.. and even when the jokes may or may not land (depending on your tastes) odds are another one will very quickly land. And as this is a gift to his fans? I can only say.. THANK YOU Kevin Smith.. it was nice seeing you again, and thank you for letting us play in your yard again for a little while.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
128,mcgill_j,Not going to gush BUT... An honest fan review.. and a worthy follow up to the Askew-niverse.,7,15 December 2019,"Let's start with the BAD. And yes there is enough of it.1. The film by it's nature LOW budget. Granted Smith has always been on the low end and some of his movies have been more successful in spite of the budget. Clerks 1, 2, Amy.. some are hampered a slight bit Dogma.. so unlike 'Strike Back' the camera is much less static and the set pieces and physical comedy are toned down a bit (even the last act fight out could have been bigger).2. This is not a negative really but at times the meta nature can make the film cheesy.. and on occasion the remake / reboot nature while the in-joke is supposed to be it's obvious is just a bit too much.Having said that. This much like 'Strike Back' is a reward for the fans who have followed not only Jay and Bob.. but Dante, Holden, Brodie, Alyssa.. his various entries into the DC universe with cameos from his 'Supergirl' gang (sadly the cameos from 'The Flash' either never happened or were cut). But this also includes jokes from Smith about not only himself.. But even more this is a real family affair. The real Kevin and Jay have grown up.. they've become fathers and in this film, do has Jay even though he doesn't know it.The reboot characters on their own adventure never really get much to do aside from the leader ""Milly"" aka Millennium Falken. I admit i appreciated her performance much more on the second viewing... She doesn't play a Jay clone and there's an actual friction between them but also as those who know the stories and obvious connection between them (Jay has idea been referred to as Uncle Jay). So it works really well on screen.Even with the limited budget it's still a nostalgia blast. A few actors return some in their iconic roles and a few in new ones. Usually just a quick scene. I think most of them have been revealed but i won't spoil them here though.I will say most people not familiar with the characters can enjoy the film on a smaller scale but will not appreciate the nostalgia fueled meta deep dive where most of the best humor comes from.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
129,jgardiner86,"Nostalgic, pop culture filled and heartfelt",7,7 December 2019,"Ill start by saying i was stoned when i watched it but i really enjoyed the film. Is it going to win an oscar? ofcourse not but its not meant to nor is it the point. The film isnt particularly original being that its rebooting old material, its not the greatest score your ever hear or even Smith film that your see but it doesnt matter. What the film is is a homage to the past 25 years of Jay and Bob, a wonderful reunion for the characters we've seen through the years and a pop culture explosion. Theres moments that feel a tad forced but if your a fan theres soo many throwbacks that you find yourself constantly reliving old favourites but in a new slightly different meta setting. Loved the cameo by the Comic book men and Q from TESD. And then there was Affleck, Damon and Lee which was gold. So glad Affleck agreed to do it. The Stan Lee footage at the end was so lovely and genuine, and a great way to show the relationship him and Smith had. A nice addition to the story that while not the best installment still a must watch for any fan and a great film to bake and watch. Im confident theres enough references to spot ones you missed on subsequent viewings. 7/10",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Justis has little role, but it is significant because Jay's daughter Millennium Falcon teaches Jay to take responsibility. Actually, that would be the lesson of the film if it weren't for a Kevin Smith film. It's full of pop culture references, from Marvel to Star Wars, everyone gets the arc. Plus it's a summary of Kevin Smith's oeuvre. It shows Ben Affleck, Matt Damon as Loki (no, not that Loki but the other one.)

I am a lifelong fan of the View Askewniverse movies, Dogma is one of my favourite films. Sadly even the in-jokes don't land.Ironically, the film suffers from most of the problems that it tries to pastiche (with reboots, nepotism etc...). The cameos (both in universe and more generally) don't work.

All of it.This movie doesn't even try - it just feels like a cash grab aimed at loyal fans. Actually, that's all it is.I used to love the fact that Smith made movies with his friends, but now it's just irritating AF.

139,thenza,Some Good Moments But All In All Falls Flat,6,16 October 2019,"I gave this movie a 6.6 out of 10.It wasn't bad and it wasn't altogether good.
I'll start with the good.Kevin Smith's daughter gives a great performance and Jay holds his own.Harley Smith fit perfectly in this movie which is odd and to go further with that that oddness is what makes cult movies like this good; that you are seeing something not mainstream or one dimensional in a character so it feels so props to that.The movie within the movie is basically the premise that was reused from the first one. I personally hate when there is any movie that has to go to Hollywood to get a movie stopped or a movie within a movie so going in I knew it was gonna be a moving plot. The idea that this movie is just a reboot for the first one is quirky and SOMEWHAT works, but it mostly doesn't towards the end and I feel was a way for Kevin Smith to cover his nuts with the poor execution of a story that was probably written while stoned.With that said, the ugly: the plot barely holds on its on not the premise the premise works but it was basically written with no production in mind at all on how to go from one scene to another, it was clown shoes. Jokes were reused some work some don't (jay makes most work) When it is over the top on how they get things done it's funny, comical, stoner making things work while forgetting; otherwise it is a big bag of fuuck flakes.I personally did not like that Kevin Smith was pretty much a lead in this I mean he is a side kick if not less I get you almost died and this is basically your legacy but damn I do not find him interesting at all. For the most part emphasis on family and growing up was thrown in there like a dissected horse, and not for nothing but damn some of these actors are looking their age.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
140,nave-25931,Stop Trowing Hater-Tots!,10,22 March 2020,"This movie is awesome and the people who hate it obviously do not or have not watched any of of Kevin Smiths films but all the jokes make sense because you have watched all those films. This movie is a satire of what is wrong with Hollywood and with American Culture in general. Did you ever wonder why so many stars agree to do these films? It is because they are fun and they do not take themselves seriously but while making a very clear point. If your looking for some sad Oscar contender type movie, than this movie is not for you. If you are a hard core supporter of the J&SB universe, then kick back, smoke or if you are in or approaching the 40verse, eat the appropriate edible, and let the good memories roll with your bestest HeteroLifeMate above all laugh!!

142,d_stack04,Some laughs but not nearly enough,5,24 October 2019,"I'll open with the simple fact that if you're not familiar with Kevin Smith's body of work, don't bother with this one. Every joke and reference will fly over your head. Having said that...I actually went to a roadshow screening of this with Smith and Jason Mewes in attendance. Even with seeing those two live and getting a sweet intro, the movie just didn't do it for me. At the same time when it points a finger at the reboot model of Hollywood and mocks it, this movie falls into the same traps as bad reboots. If it were a clever take on the reboot model (22 Jump Street), that would be a different story altogether but instead it's just the same plot all over again with the same jokes all over again.
That might be the most disappointing thing about this movie, the comedy. While there were moments I was laughing, so many of the intended jokes were either references to old jokes from Smith's previous films or line for line repeated jokes. This movie isn't Smith saying, ""hey! I came up with some new jokes for these old characters"" more than it's him saying, ""remember all these jokes that were funny 20 years ago? Well....here they are again!""
I will call out one scene where I thought to myself, ""I wish the movie was as good as this scene"" and that's the scene with Ben Affleck reprising his role of Holden McNeil. That scene was funny, heartfelt and concise. Flashes of the Kevin Smith of old with dialogue. While there is more heart in this story than the first Jay and Silent Bob movie, it's handled with the same subtlety as the comedy, beating you over the head with it.
Overall, I will say that if you love Kevin Smith's filmography and cherish every one of those films, go see this movie and laugh your ass off. If you're hoping that this movie is Smith's return to form, you'll be greatly disappointed. It's a Kevin Smith's Greatest Hits Tour, the question is, ""how much do you like his music?""",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

171,Nic_Dread_Wolf_Marling,A walk down memory lane.,9,22 January 2020,"Kevin Smith does not make movies for everyone, so naturally, this movie will be divisive, as all the View Askewniverse entries have been. Watching this film is, in a sense, like watching Endgame, or more appropriately the Arrowverses' Crisis on Infinite Earths. Sure, a good time can be had, and it can be enjoyed by those not familiar with this universe, but the true weight and heft of it will be lost. I say more like Crisis than Endgame, because, like Crisis this film knows what it is, it knows what it's universe is, and it knows what it's fans expect. It's a bit campy, and it happily plays into that role. This is what we're here for.For long time Smith fans this film hits all the right notes. It's a nostalgia filled walk down memory lane. Just about every View Askniverse character makes an appearance, including the best, for my money, characters Kevin ever created, Alyssa Jones and Holden McNeil. Smith has said that the Chasing Amy reunion scene feels like the scene that ties it all together, and it does, and not just the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, it ties this entire universe together, past and present. It's possibly the most heartfelt scene Smith's ever written, and probably the second best he's ever written and filmed, after the rain scene in Chasing Amy, in my opinion.Jason Mewes truly outdoes himself here. It's easy to see that this project is a true labor of love for him and Smith. Mewes plays the classic Jay, brash, outspoken, crude, ignorant, and generally offensive, but this go around he also gets to add a layer of depth, and some complexity, not present in the character before. The father/daughter angle to this story is brilliantly written, and Mewes absolutely nails the big moments he's given. I'd go as far as to argue that he's award worthy here.Speaking of performances, the shining, scene stealing performance here is from Harley Quinn Smith, Kevin Smith's daughter, who plays Jay's daughter. She mirrors Jay, and her mother Justice, to great effect, while being exactly what a good reboot is supposed to be, all the best bits of the original with added flavor and appeal for a new generation. She's a riot and, just as Mewes, completely knocks her big emotional scenes out of the park, and turns in one of the most memorable performances of 2019.In a way this film is nothing new, or groundbreaking, it's what fans of Kevin Smith, and the View Askniverse, have come to love and expect, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a film made by a self professed fan, for fans, while being a reboot and sequel of a cult classic universe, within that cult classic universe, and one that adds more than enough to be worthy of it's place in this pantheon.Smith has written what is clearly the film that is closest to his heart, and I couldn't be happier with the result.Oh, and Smith gives a very sweet tribute to Stan Lee and a nice nod to Marvel, something he's a notorious fan of, with his own after credits scene, and it's probably the funniest bit he's ever written. Kudos to Smith for the nuance and layers that this one closing line contains, and it's ability to be funny for those not very familiar with this universe, and the perfect closing note to the characters of Jay and Silent Bob for his longtime fans.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Did some horrible, horrible movies with little specks of brilliance here and there (Tusk, Yoga Hosers) and it took a heart attack for him to start to begin to change that.The movie is nostalgic in a bad way. However, the moments of brilliance have become bigger now. There were moments that made me tear up. Like the Stan Lee and George Carlin tributes. Some outstanding, solid, emotional acting from Mewes and Harley that seemed to come out of nowhere but were the most welcome parts of the movie. When you see that they're being sincere, that's when their acting is best. That and a truly masterful use of words and meanings during this moments that made me tear up.Kevin, if by any chance you are reading this. You don't have to be funny all the time. You've made your comedies and lived and amazing life. Maybe it's time to take all that and make a simpler film. A more personal one. You can even do a dramedy if you don't want to go completely to the other side of the spectrum. With your unique perspective in life as king of the nerds and all the beautiful friendships of friends long gone and aging? I truly think it would be your Magnum Opus.You can even use Mewes if you want. His non-goofy acting was solid. And that's because he has evolved way beyond his Jay character. So have you. Use that. And for Christ sake's stop with the self-deprecating humor. You're awesome. Own it.The verdict for the movie is a 5/10. Fans will somewhat enjoy. Non-Fans will be like ""huh?"" and hopefully this will lead to better things.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Was this worth my time, no, did it suck, yes, dumb jokes, bad acting and boom there you go....Kevin Smith for ya. To be honest I liked him better when he was fat, seemed more real back then.
Do waste your time with this film, if you want to see a great film by this joker, watch clerks, it never gets old.

However after seeing this new movie I might have to replace Mallrats with it in my top 3. This movie is a love letter to all the previous movies with so many references and inside jokes. It's a shame it didn't get a real nationwide theatrical release so I wasn't able to watch it until the DVD was released and I bought it day one without even seeing it yet. I must say, I loved it from beginning to end. While it is basically loosely based on the same premise of Strike Back, it still feels fresh and it is definitely hilarious!

This is a wonderful homage to Kevin smiths career and there's a line when he said he Convinces the cast of the reboot of bluntman V Chronic to be in the film because he had a heart attack. I dare say this is the truth but honestly as a fan of some (not all) of Smiths films I honestly enjoyed seeing previous cast members come back, and he's right, rehash the original just enough to make it different from the first and not care about the Content and people will pay for it.So true.

186,jh20001,And then the franchise dried up,3,17 January 2020,"I should start off by saying that I was and still am a huge fan of the earlier movies. Heck, I even enjoyed Jersey Girl (mostly). I grew up to them and they shaped my usage of movie quotes over the years many times. This movie, however, was less than enjoyable on the level of that it would be perfectly ok if Kevin Smith announced retirement, went into hiding, and never tried directing again. I'd rather just hold onto the memories of the earlier movies and forget that Tusk and everything that came after...ever happened. It's sad, but nothing lasts forever. Unless you're Spielberg I guess. Then you can go on directing wonderful movies, eventually preserved into a glass jar on Futurama and still making it work from there. Kevin Smith, however, has proven that he lacks the fire that used to burn within the creative side of his brain. He is still funny in person and a blast behind a microphone. Just not as a director anymore. I gave it 3 stars because it was nice to see some of the stars from the past titles and what they have become since then (and look like now). Beyond that, I just didn't feel anything. Some acting was done well, and his daughter will go places. But, I miss the deviant burst of laughs that didn't take place this time. It feels like most of the budget was spent on the fast food spot and the clone set of Comic Con (disclaimer, no spoilers there since this can be seen from the trailer). There was no budget left for the script. Too much indica during the process maybe?",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
187,bozzod,The Well Has Run Dry,4,28 January 2020,Was hoping for better. Lame retread of the original.

188,thelastemaililleveruse,A low point for one of my all time favorite directors...,4,6 December 2020,"Full cards on the table, I didn't even finish this film, I didn't want to continue my disappointment. I heard Smith had to self-produce which may speak for some of the low quality, but it doesn't excuse things like the dialogue. This film is C rate quality, I'd honestly give it 2 1/2 to 3 stars but mustered an extra star for the references the film had to the nostalgia of Smiths past films. That's an extra star for the nostalgia, not the references this film made to them as they if anything spoiled my fond memories of the originals.To Kevin Smith, this is constructive criticism, as I'd want from anyone about something I created. Smith films like Chasing Amy and Mall-rats are amazing movies in my opinion. The goofier Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks 2 I still loved and found very entertaining. Dogma and especially the first Clerks film are borderline masterpieces. The dialogue in Clerks I found so so intelligent, and I'd argue anyone to the moon and back if they thought different because it's not even up for debate.The Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is a very... very very distant far-cry from the genius Smith has presented himself as in the past. Please Smith, if you're trying to change with times or something, stop. You're comedy was sarcastic gold, before it's time and really refreshing. If we do get Clerks 3 or Mall-Brats, reflect on what your old stuff was so special for. Sarcastic, intelligent, hilarious and emotionally relatable all in one sometimes. Genius.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
189,Jimbeeer,Upsettingly bad,1,12 January 2020,"I adore Kevin Smith movies. Right from watching Clerks at a teenager to getting figures and t-shirts ordered from the Secret Stash. I even bought the Clerks cartoon series on DVD! I've seen virtually everything Mr. Smith has made, apart from Cop Out and Yoga Hosers, no-one has seen those turkeys!So I was very excited to watch Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. However now i've seen it all I truly believe that the world is a worse place with this movie in it. It's honestly that bad.It's just one meta-joke after another with very little cohesion between scenes. The storyline is virtually none existent. The acting is wooden. All the characters just seem to be there to either give us a glorified cameo or serve us with yet another in-joke into one of the following: Kevin heart attack, reviews of his previous films, to show off his family, talk about his veganism or relive a previous joke. It's like a movie version of 'An Evening with Kevin and Jason'. It doesn't work, at all!The writing is absolutely atrocious. The difference between the tight punchy sharp script that was Clerks and the stilted, heavily stoned plodding of this film is so huge, it's embarrassing to watch.The pacing is all over, one minute it's moving quickly, the next it's slowed to a crawl so Kevin can give another heavily monologue by one of the many famous actors he's guilted into doing a cameo.I just wanted to cry when this film was playing as it did one of the following and I couldn't work out what: it either made me feel really old because 'this just isn't funny at all' or it made me doubt my entire taste as a younger adult when I'm thinking 'was Kevin Smith ever funny when i was younger or was I just really stupid'. Either way this movie made me feel really bad and really embarrassed and I will never forgive it for that.The only good thing is the 2 minute Stan Lee bit right at the end. That was just lovely.I want to erase this movie from history and make it so it never existed. Then the world would be a slightly better place.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

I was hoping for something good, but what I got was a lazy, heartless attempt by Smith. It was like he didn't even try. Like Jay and Silent Bob weren't a passion project of his.I think Smith became disheartened after the loss of Jeff Anderson for Clerks III (who thankfully is back onboard), and just kinda threw the script for J&SB Reboot together without any real enthusiasm or effort. Nothing about it stands out and unlike his previous films, it has zero replay value.The movie has a few occasional funny moments and it's not wholly terrible. But that's about the most positive thing I can say about it. If you're a fan of the View Askew series of movies, you should probably still watch it - just for the references.

Featuring a career-best performance by Jason Mewes, this film explores Jay's most unlikely path in life, and does so through a screenplay written with such definite heart, it's no wonder that not making this film was one of Kevin Smith's regrets during his near-death experience. This film bares the souls of two of the most underrated people in Hollywood, in a way that brought a tear to my eye, something I did not expect coming into the movie.

After seeing this drivel maybe it's just his lack of any form of talent or creativity.Need a prime example on why remakes, reboots, ""re-imaginings"" and re-re-re's need to bloody friggin' stop? Watch this 'paint by numbers' ""movie"" and you'll never have to ask that question again.Terrible script, awful transitions from scene to scene, abhorrant ""acting"" from everyone besides a four year old, no jokes that landed unless you watched his other awful movies 20 years ago for a handful of ""hehs"". Can we all agree to stop feeding this man's over inflated ego now? He lucked out on ONE movie 20 years ago, that does not make one a ""god tier"" director.Kevin Smith should've stopped making movies in the 90s, they weren't good then and they certainly haven't gotten any better in the last 20 years.Everyone quick! Pray to the universe that because this ""reboot"" sucked so hard it'll take all the suckage from Bill and Ted 2020 and THAT will at least be awesome, because I would rather live in a world that Keanu Reeves is amazing while Kevin Smith remains a talentless hack that SOMEHOW goes famous on a really terrible handicam ""movie"" made with his friends in the 90s.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

And in concept (mocking reboots) I thought it had potential. But seriously, I'm not sure if this is a case of the internet has ruined entertainment (because every creative can find THEIR EXACT AUDIENCE who will lap up anything that creative gives them), or that he just has no one in his life (post heart attack) to stop him from making crap movies.The first 1/3 of the movie is cringe inducing. I'm a fan. I get all of the references. But that's all there is. 50% of this movies dialogue is just characters regurgitating their dialogue from his other movies (and in some cases not even THEIR dialogue, just referencing his other better movies), except now there's almost no context other than the smodverse jerking itself off. It's SO BAD. I almost turned it off.Kevin Smiths daughter is actually really good in it, and a little badass at first, and that kind of hooked me in long enough. There are a few charming moments, where there's actually some character development and it's done well. But it's seriously few and far between.It's way too inside joke after inside joke, mixed with absurdist nonsense that isn't funny. And yeah, that was kind of the point of the movie in itself (too keep just enough of what you know so you watch it, and the toss the rest to the side). But Smith is a smart guy, and has true filmmaking chops at this point in his career... this felt lazy and unclever. It's very disappointing.Also, it's just sad to watch. Everyone is so old. And Kevin Smith has aged the best! But something is weird about Jay, either he's had plastic surgery or fake teeth put in or something.. but he's weird to look at... it's uncomfortable. The whole time I just kept going ""this feels so inappropriate for (insert actor here) to be playing this kind of role at their age."" But also, who was in charge of makeup?! Maybe they look haggard on purpose? But it's not funny, it's sad.It's too fond of itself, without really being anything. It's about as good as Yoga Hosers. But better than Cop Out. But i can honestly say it's not worth watching unless you absolutely want to... I'll never watch it again.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
219,cooper-station,"The movie is fun, and its what its supposed to be.",9,12 April 2020,"The fact that most of these reviews write about this film as if it was supposed to be ranked up there with the original clerks is laughable. This film was never intended to be remembered as a classic piece of filmmaking from Kevin Smith, for that matter, neither was the original Jay and Silent Bob. The original was a fun adventure romp with a ton of hilarious cameos and references to all of Smiths previous movies and also current pop culture. Spoiler alert, thats exactly what this film is. This is honestly the perfect time and script for a Jay and Silent Bob sequel. We are in the age of reboots and its been just long enough for him to have a kid, introducing the suprisingly full of heart side plot. This film did exactly what it was intended to do. I laughed and had an overwhelming dose of nostalgia. And it was fun!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
220,brrzzpffrt,An attempt was made,4,30 April 2020,"Somehow, Smith managed to try and cash in on nostalgia while scripting references, parody and fourth wall breaking into comedy. Nothing felt natural or credible, the film tried to make fun of itself and the viewer but that was the most realistic part, can't be self-ironic and still make a good product. What came out of it was cringe. Still not sure if the whole Millennial stuff was meant to be a parody or if his daughter wrote most of the script and that's the result.
He could have made a comedy with some fourth wall breaking and he could have made a parody of himself and his work. What he did was both in one and both failed because of it.
The rest is some reflection on the part of the dads who ""starred"" in this film which could have been some second ""coming of age"" movie in its own right, but that got drowned out by goofy jokes, most of which had to be explained in scene, apparently, to kill them right on the spot. The part where you went back to Chasing Amy, that could have been a movie in itself.
This thing failed, rightfully so. Not because there wasn't good source material to go with, but because they couldn't come up with enough funny or interesting material to make the separate themes what they should be: separate movies.
Hope he gets around to really sitting down and writing another movie that's either for the heart or for the laughs. He was good at that a while ago.
Kevin Smith is that one ""indie"" guy who really knows how to write from the heart, relatable dialog, even the characters are sometimes credible when they're supposed to be overdrawn. Get back there, to the time without the big budgets and names, just friends shooting stupid films, and figure out what it is that made you want to do this. I'm sure it wasn't to create something like this.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

There's so many callbacks and 4th wall breaks in the first 15 minutes which is good in a way, get them all over with, but its a bit forced and overplayed.There is enough cameos and celebrity appearances to be entertaining which is probably the best parts of the movie.The worst would have to be Kevin Smith's daughter. She can't act and putting her with other girls who can just highlight that point. No charisma and no character.

No idea what happened to Kevin Smith, but he shouldn't be allowed to make movies any more; he's made a couple of genuine classics, a couple of near misses, and a whole pile of steaming stinkers, and this particular dropping is the crowning glory.

The storyline is very disjointed as is the case with many of his films, most of the Smith tropes have aged as well as can be expected, which is not well. In real life people evolve, none of these characters have, they're the same but move slower and have wrinkles. I think I may have laughed once, really once.
I don't know if there was anyone in charge of continuity,scenes don't follow each other in any logical way. There's no flow, the camerawork is as sloppy as a finger painting. The scene with Affleck and the kid has some of the clumsiest cuts I've seen since film school which really take you out of the entertainment.
Many of the ""stars"" of this can not act. Lines are delivered terribly or with so much ""Smithisms"" that they're cringe worthy.
The awkward cameos and blatant product placement were really dis-jarring and turned the film into a series of tongue in cheek skits without cohesion.
I really admire Kevin and his new lease on life post heart attack and part of me wanted to like this but it's terrible. Everyone looked so old, except for Kevin Smith which is really selling me on becoming vegan, or vegetarian at least.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

The humor comes from the *manner in which* that is done; you're not supposed to take the ""jokes"" at face value.It's impossible to appreciate the movie if you haven't seen the original.
Incidentally, the original in and of itself was not nearly as appreciable if you haven't seen the ones that came before it with the same characters.It's a reboot of a much better movie where the characters are trying to stop a movie being made about comic book representations of themselves, which was created to indulge hardcore fans of previous movies where the same characters appeared......

There is about 5 minutes which I did enjoy where they have the characters from Chasing Amy and the Matt Damon scene.I understand Kevin's sole purpose is to promote his daughter these days but he would be better doing that in a 'Red State' type film in my opinion (which was great).

Sadly as the film went on the stoner jokes grew tired and old and it just seemed like a director trying too hard to be the guy he was 20 years ago and please that audience. His audience has grown so why not Smith? The daughter narrative had heart but the rest of the film was just at times embarrassing.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

You know time has passed but they're exactly the same, like things have never changed. It was so enjoyable to return to so many classic characters like Dante, Brodie, Loki and Holden but Kevin Smith also introduced some new characters that have made a place in my heart. Like Milly! Who is played Kevin Smith's real life daughter, Harley Quinn Smith. I do hope to see her in future films like Clerks III or possibly in her own solo film?? I don't remember the last time having my face hurt from continuously laughing so much. But this film isn't full of laughter it also has a lot of heart too. One particular did have me about to tear up, which I did not see coming. The last Kevin Smith movie to touch me like that was Clerks II. But just as quick as the movie started it did feel like the ending was rushed, I just hope that means it's not the last time we'll see our favorite weed dealers. To add one more thing please please I beg of you to stay for the credits, you will thank me. After you wipe away the many tears on your face.

Having had my mid-to late teenage years in the early/mid 90's, I loved this movie here.Did you already like Ready Player One for it's nostalgia for 80's pop-culture and plethora of easter eggs? Did you enjoy Kevin Smith movies in the past? Then you will like this movie. It doesn't take itself very serious and makes fun of a lot of industry clichées. Has a bunch of easter eggs/tie-ins into Kevin's older movies and nods and funny one-liners: From the maker to his friends (like Guillermo) or between the actors (Kevin's daughter playing Jay's movie-kid, Kev's wife playing the waitress, Jay's kid playing Ben's daughter, etc.).My gut feeling with the upcoming Bill &Ted movie is that it will be very similar in vibe.

But now in 2019 as I find myself at the age of 42 I can honesty say my interests and sense of humor have changed as I have evolved from a young pot smoking, immature, easily amused youngster,to an adult. Unfortunately it is my opinion that Kevin Smith reached his evolutionary peak, creatively, artistically, and maturely in the 1990s. Granted the words that are on the script are different then what has been written by him before, but the style and humor has not shown one hint of evolution since before cell phones and the internet had become common household items. He seems to be relying on the same style of humor that fans of his previous films found so entertaining 20 years ago. If you are or were a fan of Kevin Smith's when he was first making his presence on to the cinematic playing field and you are still entertained by grade school, immature, stoner, level 1 humor, then kick back put on this flick on and enjoy. If you were a fan of Kevin Smith's growing up but no longer find humor in grade school, immature, stoner, level 1 humor, then put on this movie and you will be able to imagine what it must be like to see old friends from high school that have shown not a hint of evolution in 20 years.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

The father daughter story line was actually pretty heartwarming. I found myself tearing up a couple of times in the movie.The humor was on point. There were so many hilarious cameos in it. Ben afflecks was the best by far. Kevin has plenty of comedy in it for the most hardcore fans too with nods to past movies, podcasts, and his tv.The story was as good as it needed to be. Jay and Bob go to Hollywood to stop a reboot of the blunt man and chronic movie from being made. Along the way the get into shenanigans and make enemies.If you're a fan of all things Kevin Smith then you will absolutely love this movie. This movie was made for his fans.

I heard a lot about that film and despite my love for Smith and the world he had created, I had no desire to see it. It didn't appeal to me at all.It was at this point me and Smith went our separate ways.Then came Reboot. Another Jay and Silent Bob film. How could I resist. I loved these characters. What harm could it possibly do to revisit them.Turns out quite a lot.Wow.Kevin Smith, it seems, has forgotten how to direct a film. He was never perfect, far from it, and I think that was part of the charm. But this is like someones first try, not their 14th. The timing is weird. The jokes are non existent. And the acting.. Again, it's never been perfect, Mewes isn't an actor, let's face facts, again that was his charm, but in this film it appears if they've give up even trying. The only thing that got me through to the end was seeing what cameos were in it. And that's it. I can't even remember how it ends.. How bad is that.But you know what, who cares. Kevin cheated death. He's healthy now, hopefully happy and working regular. As long as he's happy that's all that matters.The only reason it gets more than 1 star is there is still a little heart in there.

292,iamjoemadden,This movie is insulting to it's fanbase.,1,9 January 2020,"I am extremely disappointed. Being such a big fan of all of the Kevin Smith, Jay & Silent Bob movies.. Mallrats, Clerks, etc..
This movie doesn't seem like it belongs in the same universe and surely doesn't try to be a part of it. Perfect example. Rosario Dawson a major character who has played Becky in Clerks II as a major character. They threw her in here.. she looks and sounds exactly the same but guess what? Shes not Becky. Did they expect us not to notice or care? Of course we care. We're investigating hours of our lives watching your stories.. some of us dozens or over 100 hours of watching you tell these stories but yet you don't care enough to be respectful to your audience by just throwing Rosario back in here but she plays someone else? She's not Becky anymore? Wtf?
In this movie the characters simply don't try to tell a story. Instead they make fun of themselves and laugh together in a series of what looks like ""inside jokes"" meant to appease and entertain the cast more so than the audience. Its also an excuse for the cast to have their kids appear in a movie. Smith seems to enjoy forcing us to have to watch his daughter on the screen. We get it man.  Congratulations. Your daughters acting sucks tho.. and shes not that enjoyable to spend 2 hours with on the screen. God so many things wrong with this movie. They actually tell many Kevin Smith jokes. Go on to bomb on and insult other Kevin Smith movies in these corny jokes that are actually WAY BETTER than this piece of trash. I can see now why this movie wasn't in theaters like a normal movie. This was more a parody or spoof than a reboot. Not a sequel, not a reboot. Its trash. I'm missed that they called it a reboot because Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was actually an amazing movie as were the titles before it that started this ensemble. I just wish they took making a movie seriously and weren't trying it spoof themselves. You don't get to be an iconic duo and then soil yourselves in front of your audience and expect it to be acceptable. My opinion of Jay and Kevin just went way downhill. Idk if I even wanna bother watching anything they make in the future. Such a turn off.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

But seeing the people we know and love again in this way was worth the price of admission. I loved all the throw back moments and characters. Holden, stole the show...him and Alyssa, the feels kicked into high gear.I enjoyed it, but I am Gen X and this was made for us. The premise of a reboot of a reboot was hilarious. I laughed and I cried...which was more than most movies have done to me in a long time.Thank you Kevin Smith for sharing this journey with us into this universe.

Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is a great follow up to the Cult classic that is Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back. It contains all the wit and funny moments we have come to love in a Kevin Smith movie. One of my favorite parts of this movie is the character arc that Jason Mewes's character Jay goes through don't want to give anything away but Kevin Smith brings the whole view askewniverse full circle.

Literally just how I see people like them.I can't tell if Kevin Smith is a total sellout because his beliefs have become trash, or because he will do anything to promote his untalented daughter. Doesn't matter, this movie was a piece of s***. I guess he used his Weinstein connections to guilt actors into being part of this piece of s***. He might as well throw his future scripts in the trash . Nobody is going to bother watching anything else he writes. All he can do now is destroy Clerks too.... 3.Reboot was a -10.

Clerks still is relevant and a masterpiece, while Dogma, Chasing Amy and Mallrats are great (even if outdated) movies.
While the 2000's bring a director trying to find balance between more serious or somber movies with dumbed down comedies, the brilliance of before began to fade and as movies as 'Cop Out' or 'Yoga Hosers' became the things he is associated with, well, it is very tough to be excited by the idea of a Kevin Smith movie nowadays.
Jay and Silent Bob reboot could be it. It could be the return to form, the chance to bring back the charm of the past to inspire more complex and enticing movies to emerge but, well, what we get instead is a mix and mash of the worst of Kevin Smith.

It gets revealed that Holden and Alyssa became very good friends, and Holden becomes the surrogate father of Alyssa's daughter. It works, trust me.Holden then goes on to speak about the merits of becoming a father, how life has changed and, more importantly, how his perspective on life has changed. It's a quiet, introspective and truly beautiful moment nestled in amongst a lot of craziness.Even though I still count myself as a Kevin Smith fan, I haven't enjoyed a lot of what he has produced in a very long while. Yogahosers should never have been seen by audiences, TUSK was Smith being incredibly amused by his own nonsense, his Batman comics were just terrible and I got completely sick of his podcasts. But I kept going back. Mostly because I was hoping to see some of the creativity and brilliance that Kevin could do when he put his mind to it.And I knew he could do it. Chasing Amy proved it, his runs on Green Arrow and Daredevil proved it, Red State proved it. The man is a natural born storyteller. Just listen to him talk in his many youtube videos. That's a gift, and one that does not come lightly.And that's where the tragedy of J&SB: Reboot comes in. Because right there, in amongst a bunch of guys who are nearly 50 and should stop pretending otherwise is this wonderful moment that proves - beyond any shadow of doubt - that that incredible creativity, intelligence and sincerity is still there.I still truly believe that Kevin Smith has at least one more brilliant piece of work in him.

I only knock it down to a nine because I wanted to see Randall and what he was doing with life, I wanted to see Dante (which to be fair he's there a moment) with Becky and their kid, I wanted to see Elias and where he had gone with life (all bringing clerks II closure for me) and I wanted a glimpse of TS & Brandi in their life as well as see Brodie (also to be fair he is there for a moment) and if he and Rene has made a life together (all bringing mallrats closure for me).Otherwise I am really happy with it. I loved that Kevin pokes fun at Hollywood again, pokes fun at remakes/reboots, and even at himself. It's also refreshing to see his evolvement of the two central characters of Jay and Silent Bob.I really enjoyed getting some further closure for certain characters, I really enjoyed the twist I actually didn't see coming, I am also very glad he kept the clip at the ending as it made me tear up.Also we could've had Ethan Suplee come back all buff and someone mention his weight loss too! 😔",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

Saw the reviews and didn't believe them... I was wrong. It isn't funny, it isn't tender, it isn't enjoyable.
A host of cameos that go nowhere and merely demonstrate how desperate so many actors are to alter their faces in a bid to secure work as they age - cringeworthy!
The 'plot' (such as it is), isn't even worth clarifying and can only assume it was based on an idea by Jason Mewes child (who was actually the best actor in this whole tragedy - she's 4 years old).

Best thing about this guy, is that he always stay true to himself, that's why we love him so much!It seems like everyone was having fun on the set, and it shows. Outstanding perfomances from Jay and Harley Quinn, heartwarming nostalgia all over the place, lovely cameos and easter eggs, I couldn't hope for more. Is it Oscar worthy? Hell no!

335,jeremytgd,The end of a cinematic universe.,10,11 January 2020,"This movie is fantastic but only for people who have seen every or damn near every Kevin Smith film and grew up with all of them. My first Kevin Smith movie was Clerks II when I was six. My uncle was watching it with my mom in the living room and their friends, they were all 18-23, young adults fresh out of the nineties and I a kid. I didn't understand that this movie would bring me to my favorite comedy franchise of all time. A year later I watched Jay and Silent Bob Strike back for the first time and thus I found my favorite dumb comedy duo ever. This movie isn't meant to appeal to the masses or Hollywood critics, it's meant to appeal to long time fans and close friends of Kevin smith which both celebrities and fans are.
This is a celebration of 30 years of friendship and if you are not a part of that group then you won't understand and or possibly like any of this, this entire movie is one big inside joke for that 30 year friendship.
A very very welcome inside joke might I add.
If you don't like this movie then you probably haven't seen nor understand Smiths other work, it's never been meant to appeal to wide audiences. Smith makes what he wants to make for him and his friends and that's it. (Outside of Cop-Out.)",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

While I wasn't old enough to see Clerks when I was younger I fell in love with View Askew with Mallrats and an adolescent. Ever since I've seen every Kevin Smith movie, yes even yoga hosers and tusk, and loved all if them regardless if how awful it may have seemed to the public. This movie gave me the feels hardcore and when Stan Lee made his cameo I was crying so hard, RIP. Sadly a great ending to the ViewAskew-verse and considering that I have never left a review for anything, this should say so much for the title. If you grew up on Kevin Smith then you will easily love this movie and hold it in high regard. Iron Bob Rocks!!!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

All of the negativity certainly falls flat considering how well it did in select theaters. Can't wait for his other reboots. Keep them coming Kevin Smith.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
342,christineabove,A walk down memory lane,9,26 January 2020,I think all the negative reviews are taking this movie too seriously. I have been a huge Kevin Smith fan for over 20 years now and I enjoyed this reboot. Was it stupid? Yes! But it's supposed to be. I really enjoyed watching it and seeing characters and actors from his past movies making their appearances and doing their bits. I even teared up during emotional scenes. The only *negative* thing about this movie is that it made me feel sad how old everyone looks compared to the original films. I got smacked with reality that I'm getting older as well. I definitely don't regret paying to rent it and will probably purchase it as well to go along with my other Smith movies. I suggest go into watching it simply for the nostalgia.,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
343,Scottie-Talks-Film,Failed attempt at nostalgia that even fails as self-parody.,3,28 January 2020,"I have been a huge Kevin Smith fan from the very first time I saw Clerks. It was brilliant, the characters, their flaws, their catch phrases, the deep reflections and social commentary, the pop-culture references, it was as if this was made for me. Mallrats, Dogma, Clerks 2 even Chasing Amy, they were all wonderful and infinitely re-watchable but were actually quite poignant and spoke to the audience about life choices. They were actually a lot more deep-and-meaningful than they first appeared.Then came the original Jay and Silent Bob movie, a more slapstick approach for Smith with a fair bit of ""cameo"" name dropping and even more toilet/stoner humor for the masses...an indulgent romp but it still worked. The characters still had depth, there were still messages in amongst it for the audience, Smith still had something to say.This latest installment follows a fairly simple premise, parody the original parody and try to make some comment on Hollywood and it's never ending quest to reboot and remake movies. In the same way that we lament the likes of the Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Total Recall and a whole host of other remakes/reboots that were totally unnecessary and subsequently failed to capture the originals excitement, so too does this movie fail to live up to the hype and expectation and ultimately seems to diminish the original movies and threatens to destroy their legacy. I guess if that was the point then job done.The overall premise is quite a good idea, a dig at Hollywood and a chance to dip back into the Viewaskew universe and take a trip down memory lane. The problem with the movie is that if you are new to these films you will not understand anything in the movie at all, but if you are a big fan then it is a cringe inducting crow-bar across the face rather than subtle nod to the originals. The jokes fall flat because they are the same jokes, but now rather than the cheeky hijinks of teenagers, or the witty banter of 20-odd year olds, it is all coming from puffy faced aging actors who just can't pull it off any more. I think if they did it subtely then it would of worked, but it is way too heavy handed and as such comes across as a bad taste parody of itself which just seems awful to watch, almost like your favourite sports star struggling as they can't compete any more but don't know how to bow out gracefully.The movie does have its moments. There are some plot lines that work, but they always seem to be ruined by cramming in another out-dated reference. There's far too much 4th wall breaking, this isn't meant to be Deadpool and it just makes it even worse to watch. There's too much of Smith poking fun at himself. There's too much trying to explain things to the audience or making excuses for what has changed. Looking at the two titular actors trying to recapture their younger selves is painful to watch at times. Credit to Smith and his weight loss, credit to Mewes for kicking the substance abuse, but they both look strange on screen now and the lack of continuity was hard to get used to.All up, this is a train wreck of a movie. Since the original J&SB flick Smith has had an awful track record. Personally I saw merit in Tusk, I actually really enjoyed Red State, but none of his films have been well received by the masses. Sometimes it is best to hang up the boots when at the top and this movie proves just that. Hopefully this is the last one we as fans have to sit through, I was looking forward to a Clerks III, but I am firmly in favour of leaving that alone before it taints the rest of the movies!Kevin Smith, I salute you for some truly exceptional movies through my younger life, please let this be a lesson that it is time to just leave these characters alone.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

349,MSquared44,Awful! What happened to Silent Bob??,1,13 April 2020,"I have been a big Fan of Kevin Smith since Clerks, but with every movie he makes he keeps slipping into the abyss I tried hard to like this film, but gave up after wasting an hour of my life watching it. I get Kevin Smith had a heart attack and wanted to make this movie for all his friends, but did it have to be this bad? I never laughed, or even chuckled at all the rehashed jokes that seemed so incredibly forced by every actor tshoehorned into the movie. I know he made it as another vehicle for his daughter, and her acting may have been the highpoint, even with the awful writing.
The best part of Silent Bob in all the movies was how ""Silent"" or reserved he was, until he neede to make a salient point. Silent Bob in this mess was over animated beyond imagination. Communicating with an iPhone the entire time was stupid, considering he can talk! Jay trying to be the crazy stoner was embarrassing as well, due to the fact that he looks about 60 years old with a bad wig.
I had minimal expectations for this film based on the last few unwatchable Kevin Smith movies, but this film was not able to even exceed those low standards

But i cant understand the hate this particular movie gets. Its not a Clerks or Mallrats sequel. Its not Dogma. Its a jay and silent bob strike back reboot. Smith stated this before release. He even explains during the Movie what a reboot is and how awfull they are. So he did exactly that. The original j&s strike back was a (very very) silly and almost barbaric hommage to Hollywood and Smith's own movies. This reboot followed the same formula and recycled a terrible ammount of jokes from the original. Just to let you all know how bad reboots are. Smith provided a lot of fan-service and nostalgia embedded in a pile of reboot-crap. Just how you like it. There is nothing wrong with this Movie. There are a lot of movies which just do the same *cough* matrix*cough* *cough*force awakens*cough* Its not the best in the world. Its a statement and a service to all Smith fans since clerks. Dont take it too serious. Its just a movie.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
354,austinwky,It's Ok.,6,23 October 2020,"I feel like this movie although nearly 2 hours long needed to have been a extra hour longer to about 3 hours long to make this a good movie. The problem is, the film does not tie up some loose ends. For example, what happened to Justice? You only have the one scene with her and Jay at her house where she lets Jay and Silent bob meet Jays child he never knew about. She said she was driving off with her partner at the end of the scene and is never seen again in the entire movie which includes the ending of the big Jay reveal when he tells his daughter who he really is and that he is her dad. Even at the credits, you do not see Justice. The security guard from the first film, there is no tie in from the first film with him. I thought for a moment we would see Silent Bob be the father of the black girl but that never happened. The best part of the movie was probably the climax of the reboot trailer being shown plus the fight scenes etc.......Overall, the comedy wasn't as clever and just a bit more out there, not sure if that is because I am older now or what, but it just isn't there. I do love the whole introduction of Jay having a daughter, I feel like if anything, this movie can be indeed a reboot, and we should get a sequel with Jay and his daughter adventures with lots of Silent bob etc... Honestly, that's how it feels to me, like this is a set up for a sequel, but if it happens, we will find out, more than likely, I would assume no.I don't think it's a bad film, but it definitely isn't a good film and a lot seemed to be left out. Even the other teen girls were a bit of a let down because they did not have a impact on this movie or any shine/star power spot light time. It was more so just Jays daughter. So yeah, I'm not sure if they were even needed in the film sadly. Just a lot was left out, and again I feel like if this film were another hour longer they could have added a lot more in.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

It wrapped up a lot of things nicely and I bet the actors, producers & the rest of the crew had fun time working together again.Obviously the plot was absolutely silly and sometimes the jokes made me cringe, but what are you expecting from a Jay & Silent Bob movie?

About a third of the way through I realized what I was watching. Kevin Smith running around with a camera and having fun with his friends and family. It's exactly why we loved him in the first place.
So I loved watching Kevin Smith do it again with his daughter. But now he's got a ton of budget and Hollywood tricks and clout. Yeah he does some of the same jokes. Just like your dad with his dumb dad jokes. But it's a family reunion film told as a Hollywood film told as a fake reboot.

If you like Smiths previous efforts, you will find something enjoyable here even if it is brief nostalgia.In a time where life is taken seriously and movies feel like they have to be made by a committee being over cautious not to offend anyone, it's nice to just switch off and watch something that feels like it came from a more carefree, honest and direct time.

Isn't this growing up?I enjoyed it like I did all the others, OK it's nowhere near as slick as Dogma or the Clerks movies. But did it need to be, should it be? I don't think so. For me Kevin is the comedy Tarrantino for my generation. When he's at his best, not many people can do what he does. It's unashamedly honest.Does he need to make another J&SB movie, no. Will he? I don't think so, nor does he need to. I think the characters have run their course and asking them to carry another movie on their shoulders would be too much of an ask and I'm sure Kevin even considered this when making it, but, like every good artist, sometimes it's good to give the hardcore fans another bite of the cherry.

376,talk-tome,Does what it says on the can,8,13 January 2020,Enough here to enjoy the legacy stuff from the old school. You can already tell they had a heap of fun making this.,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
377,imnotwhatyousayiam,Hilarious,10,21 January 2021,Kevin Smith knocks it out of the park yet again. Between the non stop laughs and the absolute meta commentary about the film industry in general he even manages to add in heartwarming moments that will bring anyone especially fans of his prior films to tears. The casting was perfect with the exception of not having Ethan Suplee or Jeff Anderson. In closing if you haven't seen his prior films (Kevin Smith) you'll get a load of laughs if you are a fan of his films it'll have you laughing from the first scene to the end of the credits. I give this movie two thumbs up.,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

383,azelward,A kick square to the nostalgia balls,6,14 November 2020,"This movie isn't cinematographically, or even scriptually (not even sure if those are words) good. Compared to Strike Back, it's severely lacking in character, and story development. That being said, I'm pretty sure that is exactly what everyone attached to this was going for. It relies on it's own meta on purpose, and for that fact alone should be praised. Sure, the acting is borderline abysmal (looking at you Mewes/Harley)..with a slim few exclusions (ie Aflec, Lee, and the oh-so-talented Diedrich Bader), and although the acting only shines through in cameos, let us not forget that Strike Back relied heavily on cameos itself!If you're a Kevin Smith fan, this movie will definitely appeal to you. Is it his best work? No. But it does what it sets out to do, and hits all the right nostalgic pressure points. (And the scenes during the credits are worth the watch on their own) Snoochie boochies!",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
384,smackaxuni,Better than expected,8,16 October 2019,My wife and I grew up on these movies. They were never meant to be Oscar contenders. This one is as close to a return to 90s jay and silent Bob as your gonna get. I rarely laugh out loud anymore and we both lol'd more than a few times. To say much more would spoil parts of the movie; go see it If you have any interest to do so. If nothing else it's worth a watch/rent to see Stan Lee one last time.,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
385,echum,This Movie Wasn't Made for You,7,1 May 2020,"Okay so here's the deal, this movie wasn't made for you, me or a studio executive. It was a group of old friends who haven't seen each other in a very long time catching up. Come in to watching this movie with that mindset and it will likely be more enjoyable.
I'm not saying this is his best work, far from it. It is safe and comfortable. Not trying to push any boundaries or set any records. I saw review after review dogging this film with alot of them saying that it was terrible and full of old jokes and plot lines, but hell folks...that was the point. That was also part of the joke the entire film was based on. At least it wasn't doing exactly what Hollywood does and drown everyone in poorly written exposition to catch everyone up.
The only downside that I could see is that if you had an incomplete history of the Kevin Smith films (Clerks, Malrats, etc), much of the humor is lost. However if you saw those movies and even better...saw them when they were newly released, this movie is a welcome nostalgic trip into fond memories.
I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who has seen previous Kevin Smith works.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
386,nautviculas,Jay and Bob Strike Back Again,8,16 March 2020,"I don't get how any Jay and Silent Bob fan can fail to see the beauty in this movie. It's touching to see Jay somewhat mature in this film. The cameos are a perfect homage to earlier films. You get two batmans. A Stan Lee appearance. A Jason Lee appearance. All the great stoners in film either show up or get name dropped. Chris Hemsworth shows up for wonderful holographic scenes. Chasing Amy gets a happy ending. Dogma eludes to the possibility of a sequel (Alanis Morissette willing)... and it's nice to see the duo back in action. Harley Quinn was a wonderful Justice reboot with the heart of Jay inside her. There was great fun to be made and had here. If you're a true Jay and Silent Bob fan, this reboot satiates a void you've been feeling for a long, long time. Jason Mewes real life struggles are joked about and in thay light, it was absolutely wonderful to see him reprise his classic character once again. I wish Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes the best! Maybe this movie will lead to an actual Bluntman And Chronic Movie, Dogma 2 and even further down the line, Chasing Amy 2 (whatever the titles may be). This movie existing is a great hope, and like I said, if you're a true fan, you're in for a wonderful little ride.
To the negative posts, what was it that even drew you to Jay and Silent Bob in the first place? Are you mad they aged? Are you mad the actors that played them had their own issues to deal with that in turn was responsible for the hiatus of the return of Jay and Silent Bob? If you didn't like this movie, you never truly liked the franchise because it's all here. Kevin Smith should be proud of this movie, and proud of his friends for being a part of it. Even if it's the guiltiest movie ever. It has merit. We see a modernized version of these Jersey Boys.  But this reboot is not a flop. This movie like all Jay and Silent Bob movies are self-aware. I loved it. So with sober eyes for the first time on a Jay and Silent Bob movie, I have to say THANK YOU for EVERYONE involved.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
387,ccalstuff,Everything I expected and so much more!,10,17 November 2019,If you aren't familiar with kevin Smith's works this film isnt for you. But if you are familiar it is one of his best films yet non stop laugh-a-thon. Absolute masterpiece!!!,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

402,cyberg-18910,kevin smith fan,5,8 December 2019,Time takes its toll and it even takes its toll on your comedy chops. Not a whole lot of funny in this movie. it feels forced and uncomfortably so in some scenes. save yourself some money and just rewatch the first one.,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

404,imkeenandrew,"Ummmm, where's the jokes?",1,28 March 2021,"So I did the sensible thing and got pretty baked before watching this movie. The weed was quite good - not the killer kind of gear that wipes a person out but the type of high where your mind remains sharp and everything becomes even more engaging that usual.I was at a close friends house whom I'd first got to know Kevin Smith movies with 24 years earlier when Mallrats finally released on VHS in our country after being delayed a jillion times. Being much older this time around we weren't as pumped as we were for Mallrats but we knew we were in for a good time and some Kevin Smith awesomeness.We watched the movie and it was like, hmmmmm maybe we are too baked to get it? These appear to be Kevin Smith jokes so we should be laughing.Nope nope nope. Same thing happened the next morning when sober - no laughter, no engagement and zero cares given for characters we know and love from his past works.I dunno if it's the weed he smokes, Kevin's age or if he's spread so thin these days he doesn't have time to polish any of his work - but this movie sucked more than any movie has ever sucked before. It was cringe as balls.The concept appears to be is to take the movie reboot concept and layer the maximum amount of absurdity on top. The problem is that Kevin Smith channeled so much absurdity that he himself changed at a cellular level. Being so completely altered by the process of writing that it transformed his very DNA, he then lost his power of objectivity and the ability to channel any sort of human emotion into his work. The result is a lifeless movie that fails to engage on any level other than the challenge to keep watching. Even the Affleck cameo was wasted.Hopefully the global pandemic has given him enough time to dedicate to writing and creating something even half decent for his next trip into the askewniverse.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot

But ive grown up im in my 40s and no longer smoke
As much as i really wanted to like this its one of the worst movies i have ever watched
I have not watched any of his films past clerks 2 so havent seen his daughter in anything before but what everyone else says is right she looks wierd is irritating and cant actkevin and jason should also grow up and stop smoking
Although judging by the look of there faces and jasons distacting chin i dont think there smoking weed anymore",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
407,scooter-88913,If you thought you loved Kevin Smith before...,10,18 October 2019,This movie was great! Little bit of old a little bit of new but nothing to ruin the historic data of the previous movies. I hope if you have enjoyed the characters from the Jersey movies of the past that you will just get the warm feeling in your heart (or your pants) that this movie gave me... Thank You Kevin Smith for another great movie!,Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
408,therealjzn-84637,This sucks.,3,9 December 2019,"The premise is cute. Make a film reboot about the reboot phenomenon that's about ""itself"".
Everything else blows. We have two 50 year old men playing characters created as and meant to cater to grunge stoner 90s kids. The jokes that are new are barely worth a chuckle. The rest of the crap is, well all re-joked. And the ""adventure"" aspect of the movie is gone. Doesn't feel at all like a destination. Just feels like locations where they can squeeze in whatever lame old SNL celeb is required at the moment.
Kevin Smith was decent once upon a time, but he got old and his writing did not. Clerks was quirky, Mallrats was decent for a dumb youth comedy. But I should've known better after I sat throughTusk.
Sorry, Id have like to like this but Jay & Silent Bob are relics of a long gone era. Everyone wants nostalgia to work, but it's just like opiates. The second hit doesn't get you as high as the first. Nostalgia just quickly feeds the addiction you can't explain. Then it's on to the next one.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
409,parkerdean,This reboot is terrible,2,3 July 2020,"Fortunately, for guy who lasted 45 minutes, I lasted 4 minutes. The story makes a ton of references to the original show, which I watch probably 20 years ago and the jokes are a waste of time because I can't remember anything from the original. These guys even make cheap stereo type jokes and considering what is going on, is really not appreciated. They even tried to stuff the movie with a ton of famous cameos, which does not help.The movie is like watching something my brothers kid made. The cheap jokes that were funny in the 90's just don't hold up and to make things more unbearable this movie makes use realize the Kevin and whats his face, can't act.Kevin and whats his name, are way too old to be playing the same roles. Speaking of whats his name, at times he is hard to understand, which he should have used Polident to keep his dentures in place. Kevin lost a metric ton of weight and it hard to watch him, kind of like watching Al Roker.",Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
