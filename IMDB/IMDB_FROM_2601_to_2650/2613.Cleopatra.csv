0,TheLittleSongbird,Wasn't entirely sure what to make of this one,5,31 May 2014,"If there was anything at all to sum up what I thought of Cleopatra(1963) it would be a very mixed bag, it's not as bad as has been cited to be but it is easy to see why it bombed. There are definitely things to like about Cleopatra, for one thing with the vivid colours, the amount of authenticity in the costumes and sets and the lavish cinematography it really is a feast for the eyes, one of the better-looking films of the 60s. Alex North's score is a very hypnotic and memorable one, adding hugely to what's happening, with parts where it really rouses the spirit and others where it is appropriately melancholic. There are some good performances in the cast too, though it is a case of the supporting actors being better than the leads. Particularly good is Rex Harrison, if anything it's actually a brilliant performance, he has rarely been more restrained than here as Caesar and it is very moving. Caesar was the film's most sympathetic and relatable character and you do feel genuinely sad at his demise. Roddy MacDowell is a close runner up, he is very chilling and looks as though he is really enjoying himself. And the film is not without effective scenes, because Cleopatra's entrance is suitably sultry and the ending is somewhat emotional, in fact the film does start off quite well and the supporting performances have a lot to do with it. However, the two leads don't fare so well. Richard Burton does have his moments, he is enigmatic and at least seems to understand and connect with what was given to him, but he can be wooden too and chews the scenery too much(the overly melodramatic second half doesn't help though). Even more problematic is Elizabeth Taylor, she has done a lot of great stuff but this really is not one of her finest hours. She's beautiful and sexy but her performance does come across as shrill and like a spoilt rich girl. Burton and Taylor's chemistry has mixed results, in the first half it has moments where it resonates but like the drama it is often cold. The story is a huge problem too, as a matter of fact if there was a component that could be seen as the biggest flaw it would be the story. Much of it is dragged out and overstuffed, and while the story of Antony and Cleopatra is an epic one it doesn't feel like that here. That it has a much-too-overlong length that due to the very pedestrian pacing feels like it is a big part as to why. Cleopatra is directed in a very stagy and emotionally cold way (hard to believe that it was the same director who directed All About Eve, one of the best films ever made in my opinion), and although the cast is a large one a lot of roles are far too come-and-go and blink-and-you-miss-them walk-ons quality. And there is no better news about the script, which has far too much talk, can sound very awkward and is very skim-the-surface feeling. It takes a very melodramatic turn in the second half and it is incredibly ham-fisted. Summing up, a difficult film to rate, has some obvious good things but is hugely problematic too, at least to me. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Cleopatra
1,bkoganbing,The Greatest Love Affair Of All Time,9,9 September 2006,"No we're not talking about Cleo and Caesar or Cleo and Antony, we're talking about Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton on the set of this mammoth epic. I well remember in 1962 you could not get away from all the talk about the hanky panky that Liz and Dick were engaged in. It took the Cuban Missile Crisis to knock it off the front page and out of people's minds. But as the costs on this version of Cleopatra mounted, Darryl F. Zanuck couldn't have bought better publicity than this.And it's a pretty good film also. But I think the acting honors in this go to Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar. It is the best portrayal of Caesar I've seen on either the big or small screen. Harrison's Caesar is a man at the top of his conqueror game, not anyone's fool. Though he's definitely charmed by Cleopatra, he's fully aware of what she wants from him also. His fall is not from misjudging Cleopatra, but misreading public opinion back in Rome.Contrast that with Richard Burton as Mark Antony. No doubt the love affair and eventual marriage to Liz Taylor helped his performance as a man is totally thinking with his hormones. As for Elizabeth Taylor she is a most bewitching and lovely Cleopatra. She was the perfect Cleopatra for her time.Roddy McDowall probably has his best adult screen role as Octavian. He undergoes a remarkable transformation from callow youth to bloodless conqueror. What Antony tears up and throws away, he just hangs around and picks up the pieces. In the supporting cast I would single out Andrew Keir as Agrippa, Gregoire Aslan as Pothinus, and Martin Landau as Ruffio for special mention.A whole lot of tickets were sold to see the most publicized lovebirds of all time in 1963. They had to be because Cleopatra's cost over runs nearly broke 20th Century Fox. But the move going public saw and intelligent and literate spectacle. Director Joseph Mankiewicz gave us DeMille grandeur without DeMille Victorian dialog.And that's as good a reason as any to see Cleopatra.",Cleopatra
2,Leofwine_draca,Overblown historical epic,6,19 July 2015,"Was there any need to make CLEOPATRA a four-hour-plus historical epic, supposedly the biggest film ever made? I'm not too convinced. Although this film is lavish and filled with magnificent spectacle, there isn't really too much story to propel the narrative along. The result is a story that feels long-winded and overblown, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor chewing the scenery with relish in their performances as the doomed twosome.The first half of this production is much better than the second, focused as it is on a restrained Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar. The story is told well and the budget is high enough to do more than ample justice to the backdrops and costumes. The battle sequences are well handled and the sets are frequently mouth-dropping. A shame, then, that in the second half things slow down considerably and not much really happens.I'm the first to admit that I'm not really a fan of Taylor's Cleopatra, who seems one-dimensional throughout. Burton's Antony is better, but his character is difficult to warm to; the supporting players like Roddy McDowall, Martin Landau, and Andrew Keir are much more interesting. Although I'd never seen this film before, I ended up feeling that I'd been spoilt by later movies: it's hard to take the pompousness seriously after CARRY ON CLEO, while the TV series ROME handled the same story in a much more refined way. That leaves CLEOPATRA a mildly interesting piece of spectacle and very much a product of its era.",Cleopatra
3,SnoopyStyle,Grand epic and great Harrison,7,23 May 2015,"Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) has just defeated Pompey but Pompey has slipped through his fingers to Egypt. King Ptolemy has just driven his co-regent sister Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) from the throne. In Alexandria, Caesar finds Pompey beheaded by Ptolemy and is visited by Cleopatra rolled up in a rug. After disposing Ptolemy, Caesar has a son with Queen Cleopatra. Meanwhile rumblings of descent is rising in Rome. When Caesar pushes to be emperor, he is assassinated. Mark Antony (Richard Burton) and Octavian (Roddy McDowall) hunt down the conspirators and are installed as joint rulers of the empire.Rex Harrison is magnificent. He's the perfect foil for Taylor. They have a great first half of the movie. That half represents all the greatness of old Hollywood. It has the grand productions and the actors are never overshadowed. Harrison and Taylor rises above it all. When Caesar dies, the movie goes downhill. Richard Burton is constantly overacting. It's as if he's over-compensating for something or is acting under duress. And Taylor joins right along with him in the broad big acting. Roddy McDowall is a fun villain but the second half is mostly unbearable. There is no doubt that this is a real old fashion epic. It's too bad that the second half is such a mess.",Cleopatra
4,Hitchcoc,Some Say a Failure but a Publicist's Masterpiece,7,21 January 2017,"The unevenness has been explained many times. This was supposed to be two movies. We will never know because the producers grabbed their pocketbooks and wouldn't let go. This is a good story, but it doesn't work because about a third is missing. That said, take each of the characters and ask yourself if they did a good job presenting themselves. Taylor is beautiful and very interesting, Rex Harrison is his usual intriguing personage, and Roddy McDowell, who I remember most as a child actor may be the best of all. I mostly remember the drama among the actors and all the news coming out of Hollywood, concerning ""Cleopatra."" Taylor and Burton, Taylor and Harrison, on and on. I think there are times when the hype supersedes the product and we were treated to daily reports from the press on this ""disaster."" Still, if you can look past the unevenness, there's a lot of fun here. Especiallly the epic battle scenes and all the other spectacle. At the time, perhaps the most expensive film ever made.",Cleopatra
5,mark.waltz,There's no de-Nile. This is just so amazing.,8,18 October 2015,"Far from a perfect movie, Cleopatra still remains one of the most controversial movie ever-filmed because of its successes, The scandals behind the scenes and the effect that it had on Hollywood budgeting. In the BBC mini-series I Claudius, the Roman Empress Livia comments. that she was once known as one of the greatest beauty is in the world, there was one, but she died years before and she lived in Egypt. That was of course Cleopatra, and while she probably didn't look like any of the Hollywood actresses who played her, the legend of her still exists. I walk through Central Park past the alleged Cleopatra's needle and I have to remind myself that this was apparently another Cleopatra because the Queen depicted in this movie was one of many Cleopatra's in Egypt history, along with the Ptolemies, the cities and other Egyptian king names.Vivien Leigh, Scarlett O'Hara herself, played Cleopatra in a George Bernard Shaw play ""Caesar and Cleopatra"" opposite Claude Rains. Vivien Leigh said upon seeing Rita Hayworth walk into a room, how do you compete with that! I am curious just wonder how she would have felt if Elizabeth Taylor had walked into that room because certainly she ranks among the top beauties of all time. And like Vivian and Rita, she was a beauty who could act. well her later performances could be considered overacting, in Cleopatra she is actually very subtle.she is not perhaps the right age, but neither was Theda Bara, Claudette Colbert or Vivien Leigh. Certainly based upon what history has shown, she was also not the right color. But forgiving Hollywood its misrepresentation of history, you have to look at Cleopatra from the perspective that it was made in the early sixties.At nearly four hours long, Cleopatra ranks in my opinion along with the Ten Commandments as an extremely watchable epic. However, unlike the classic Colbert version of 1963, Cecil B DeMille is not involved in this. Obviously influenced by the success of the Ten Commandments less than a decade before, Cleopatra is a gorgeous fantasy based on the life of a Queen that truly create discussion to this day. Rex Harrison deserved his Oscar nomination to play Julius Caesar, just a year prior to playing Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady and winning an Oscar for repeating his Broadway role. He is simply stunning and there is a magnificent chemistry between him and the leading lady. I wish I could say the same about Richard Burton as Marc Anthony and Taylor, because while they might have created heat off screen, they didn't light up on screen as well. Their most memorable pairing was of course Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and that was because their characters were fighting rather than making love throughout the movie.Excellent detail goes into every moment of this,and in the supporting cast, Roddy McDowall in certainly amazing as Augustus Caesar. the subtleties of Brian Blessed from I Claudius playing the same role goes out the window for McDowell show me performance. this could almost your pre Chris sir to that magnificent BBC epic. Also, look for Hume Cronyn in a small but memorable role as well as Carroll O'Connor. This is a film that has so many great moments that can manipulate you into thinking Madison up a better movie that really is. Certainly, Cleopatra entrance into Rome remains one of the classic movie visuals of all time. She truly rolls here, and it is unfortunate that the film was surrounded by controversy over her affair with Burton well still married to Eddie fisher. When you look at Elizabeth Taylor and remember all of the amazing things that she did in her life time, you can't help adore her.Excellent photography and consistent and detailed direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz makes this a film that truly should be seen on a big screen rather than on television. But if you are not willing to wait for its anniversary or a special showing, simply just get the movie and put it on, and watch it in several parts before you truly judge it. As I said, it is far from perfect but it is certainly one film that you will certainly never forget.",Cleopatra
6,kosmasp,All ways lead to ...,8,6 June 2020,"Now I do not know how historically accurate most of this is (I expect it to have taken a lot of liberties in making this as dramatic as possible). After watching this I admit I have to freshen up on my Roman history again sometime. Having said that, this is the story of Cleopatra more than it is about anything else. Yes the backdrop are Cesars and Romans in their attempt to expand their Empire. But while certain things are clear on display, most of them have Cleopatra front and center. Even the very infamous ""e tu brutus"" historical incident (let's call it that, for those even less in the know than myself), is seen through her eyes and interestingly shot/displayed.Having said that, certain things may not have aged well for viewers nowadays. A lot of things can be seen as ""cheap"". You can tell certain things are plastic/styro rather than stone or whatever material else it is supposed to be. But if you concentrate on that you are missing the point. Also this was one of the most costly production and it shows on screen. The crowd scenes, the set design, the clothes and so many more things are just incredible. Again aged, but still amazing to think of the effort behind it all.Speaking of which: quite the effort and end result if you think about everything that went on behind the scenes. A lot of turmoil, actors not liking each other, to much downtime, troubled production overall and so forth. There are is another movie alltogether for that stuff ... and some of it can be read of course too. Curious to see what of it all will be touched on the special features of the DVD I own. Elizabeth Taylor at one point was larger than life ... who better to play Cleopatra one might ask? So with all the issues, the end product is still a sight to behold. And as some may say: they don't make them like they used to ... (which in certain respects might not even be a bad thing, but again, this is always in the eye of the beholder)",Cleopatra
7,Sleepin_Dragon,Abysmal acting from the lead ruins a big budget blockbuster.,5,12 October 2020,"I am genuinely stunned to see the generally high rating here, having just watched it, I would say it's worthy of its generally poor reputation. On the plus side the visuals are glorious, an enormous cast, lavish costumes, great sets, it is visually very appealing. Rex Harrison is terrific.Unfortunately the plot is all over the place, the story rushed at times, and drawn out in others, the dialogue, particularly between Taylor and Burton is cringe worthy. The main issue here for me, is Taylor, beautiful, with those stunning eyes, but her acting is woeful, I found her so incredibly wooden, her scenes with Burton at times were painful to watch.I understand that it's iconic, a classic to many, the best thing for me, is that Carry on Cleo ended up with some of the sets, it made that film look astonishing. Amanda Barrie injected more life into her comedy Cleo, than Taylor managed.Sorry, but this was poor. 5/10.",Cleopatra
8,gavin6942,Four hours of this...,6,1 April 2016,"Historical epic. The triumphs and tragedy of the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra.This is the sort of film that is both impressive and also daunting. You have to admire them making a film more than four hours long on Cleopatra and her romances with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony. Whether accurate or not, it is quite the undertaking.But then, you also have more than four hours... which is quite an investment. If this was a TV mini-series, I could see that. But it is rather long to sit through without an intermission. Did people in the theater wet themselves? Perhaps, as the film remains as well known today (2016) as it was in 1963.",Cleopatra
9,jboothmillard,Cleopatra,5,20 February 2009,"I knew two of the lead stars of the film, and I knew it was an expensive film, I just didn't know how expensive, or how long is was, from Golden Globe nominated director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve, Guys and Dolls, the original Sleuth). Basically it is the historical epic drama, in the year 48 B.C. where Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Richard O'Sullivan) is supreme ruler of Egypt, having ""desposed"" of his Queen sister Cleopatra (Dame Elizabeth Taylor). But along comes Caesar (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Rex Harrison) to restore some order to the kingdom of Egypt, despite being from Rome, he even sees to marrying the Queen and having a son, oh, and Ptolemy was banished. It is when Caesar is murdered that trouble starts again some years later, when his protégé Marc Antony (Richard Burton, who married Liz the next year) has become smitten by Cleopatra, and she can't help herself. She is angered when she finds out he is marrying Octavia (Jean Marsh), sister of the ambitious Octavian - Caesar Augustus (Golden Globe nominated Roddy McDowall), and he quickly changes his mind, and marries Cleopatra. There is a war with some battleships shooting at each other, a bit of banter and politics, and the film ends with Antony dying, and Cleopatra following not too long after. Also starring Pamela Brown as High Priestess, George Cole as Flavius, Hume Cronyn as Sosigenes, Cesare Danova as Apollodorus, Kenneth Haigh as Brutus, Andrew Keir as Agrippa, young Martin Landau as Rufio, Robert Stephens as Germanicus, Francesca Annis as Eiras, Grégoire Aslan as Pothinus and Martin Benson as Ramos, I have to say, some of the oddest character names I have ever heard. Apparently, back then it cost around $40 million to make, today that would be around $250 million (that would beat Titanic's $250 million), it could have been because of Taylor getting sick a lot. More obvious reason would be the length of the film, four hours and eight minutes of nearly blah, sexy, blah, politics, blah, battle, blah, death, it was obvious I would doze off at some point. I much preferred the spoof film Carry On Cleo. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Alex North, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Richard Burton number 70 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Burton was number 29 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was also number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and she was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Worth watching, at least once!",Cleopatra
10,moonspinner55,"Cleopatra: ""I have rubbed you the wrong way!"" Cesar: ""I'm not sure I want to be rubbed by you at all!""",5,21 September 2001,"Opulent misfire about the Queen of the Nile and her stormy relationships with Julius Cesar and Mark Antony. Runs four hours and seven minutes, and is chock full of nonsense--from the dialogue to the performances to the over-production. Despite widescreen grandeur and isolated moments of intriguing melodrama, the film is frequently ridiculous, not to mention obscenely overlong. Oscars went to Leon Shamroy for his admittedly fine cinematography; also to the costumes, the art director, and the special effects. For a much stronger film-treatment of the tempestuous Cleo, try Claudette Colbert in the 1934 version. ** from ****",Cleopatra
11,dbdumonteil,"A tragedy,not a soap opera.",10,4 August 2001,"I have always thought it was one of the most underrated Hollywood epics.First of all,it's only partially an epic:most of the scenes are intimate,generally two characters who are constantly tearing each other apart.Joseph L. Mankiewicz,one of the most intelligent director of his time,rewrote the dialogue during the shooting,night after night ,and the results are stunning,considering the difficulties he encountered with his budget and his stars.Cleopatra's dream is perfectly recreated,much better than in De Mille 's version -a good one,though-:It's Alexandre the great 's plan ,this Alexandre from whom she's descended,to make a huge empire,uniting the Orient and the Occident.One of the major scenes takes place near the great conqueror's grave .The second part has Shakespeareans accents:Cleopatra becomes some kind of Lady Macbeth,and Marc Anthony is left alone against the whole Roman army (the Shakespearian trees).The last lines (repeated twice) are some of the finest you can find in an epic movie.And look how Fellini has been influenced by Mankiewicz for the final of his ""Satyricon"":the photograph turning into a fresco. As for the epic scenes,they are here,of course but they are little over 20% of the movie.And to Cleo's awesome Rome entrance ,you can prefer Ceasar's epilepsy fit.The actors are not as uneven as it's often said.Elizabeth Taylor had already worked with Mankiewicz (the extraordinary ""suddenly last Summer"") and she learned a lot with him;she's now ready for the great roles of the sixties:""Virginia Woolf"",""Secret ceremony"" ""taming of the shrew"".Richard Burton had been ""Alexander the great"" (coincidence!) in a rather academic movie,and here he portrays a clumsy,almost Don Quixotesque Marc Anthony with art.However,Rex Harrison steals the show in the first half.Supporting actors ,including Roddy MCDowall ,a puny but shrewd Octavious,and Richard O'Sullivan ,an effeminate Ptolemy. This visual poem,a feast for the eye and for the mind must be restored to favor.",Cleopatra
12,blanche-2,after all that hoopla -- not bad,7,18 April 2011,"""Cleopatra"" is one of the most notorious films in history, for often discussed reasons, not the least of which is bankrupting 20th Century Fox with its $44 million price tag.In the end, was it worth it? Hard to say, but you can't beat ""Cleopatra"" for sheer spectacle, opulence, majesty, and costumes! And for those of us who grew up in the '60s, let us not forgot that Cleopatra makeup we all walked around with.There are also some wonderful performances in this film, notably Rex Harrison as Caesar, Richard Burton as Marc Antony, Roddy McDowell as Octavian -- and let's not forget the perfectly cast Elizabeth Taylor, gorgeous and resplendent and certainly believable as both queen and seductress.The film sticks to the true history, with the exception of the children Cleopatra had with Marc Antony -- four in all, including twins. The only child shown in the film, Caesarian, didn't outlive his mother by much, as Octavian had him killed after Caesarian won support as Pharaoh of Egypt.Since the film took so long to make, one does notice differences in Taylor's appearance, particularly her weight. In the scenes filmed after her illness, she is quite tiny and in the scenes beforehand, she is a little bigger. Since the scenes seem to have been filmed out of order, it can be disconcerting. Let's face it, it's hard to stay at the same weight for five years, particularly after you've nearly died. None of it is enough to detract from her great beauty.Cleopatra eventually made more than $44 million, but that doesn't mean it actually turned a profit. In order to show a profit, usually a film needs to make three times its cost. I don't believe to this day that Cleopatra has ever done that. No matter - it was the start of a huge love affair and was yet another coffin nail in the big studio system. And with all of that, it's a well-made film that doesn't scrimp on opulence. Somehow, even with all that went on, it never lost its way.",Cleopatra
13,Quinoa1984,"at best it's intelligent and captivating and historically interesting film-making - at worst, it's dull exposition",8,14 July 2008,"It's one of the big ""fiasco"" stories of Hollywood lore: the most gargantuan budget spent on a single motion picture- 47 million (the equivalent of about 260 million today)- on an epic so huge in scale that it was nearly unthinkable, however true, that it started out as a modestly budgeted production that skyrocketed by a myriad of reasons. Not least of which was star Elizabeth Taylor herself, who first stopped the first try at production with Rouben Mamoulian through her various real/fake illnesses, then second through her notorious relationship with Richard Burton that started on the set and distracted them from certain scenes (which is arguable but the point is valid). By the time the film was released it could in only a miracle recoup its budget in its initial theatrical run, and got (to say it nicely) mixed reviews.To see Cleopatra now isn't to say that history has been entirely kind to the production, but it should be said that it can be viewed somewhat on the terms that Joseph L. Mankiewicz set out for the final product. All the money is up there on the screen, in nearly disgusting detail and extravagance, yet the director has also crafted something that does, usually, have substance past the enormous spectacle and (also to say softly) lavish production designs and sets. He tells the story of Cleopatra, Egypt's most (in)famous queen, in a split-act form that is like two movies strung together (in fact it was the director's idea to have them as separate 3-hour epics, though eventually each part was trimmed by an hour and put together again), and while the latter part might work better than the former, it's an impressive, flawed, and interesting effort all the same.It might be much to go into too much detail about all of the specifics of the story, as it would take up far too much of this review. Suffice to say it's first about Cleopatra (Taylor) and her mentor-cum-father-to-her-child Caesar (Rex Harrison, in surprisingly good two-dimensional form), and then after he is killed her hot and complex relationship with Marc Antony (Burton), and the eventual war between Rome and Egypt via the new power-hungry Caesar (stunning Roddy McDowell). For this first part, which is mostly with Harrison and Taylor and a little Burton thrown in, it's a lot of exposition that sometimes is quite dull; one wonders when the big spectacle will come about, the exception of course that spectacular ""entrance"" of Cleopatra's into Rome.Yet, it's never really too dis-interesting, if only from a (Hollywoodized) historical point of view, and if one is a buff of Roman history- or, at least, Roman epics- there should be enough to hold the interest. It's when Cleopatra and Marc Antony get the most screen time in the second half, however, that things start to get a lot more absorbing; the chemistry in real life rubbed off on the two stars, and there are scenes where Burton (probably the most highly charged of the major actors) and Taylor square off like it's oneupmanship. And as Mankiewicz goes further with the story into the final battle, things pick up in the narrative that suddenly gets things boiling like a good old-fashioned epic, and there's finally a synergy of substance and style that is spotty for some portions of the film.Yes, it's probably TOO big, and TOO long, and with the hubris of the producers and its stars right up there in certain moments if not spread throughout (it goes without saying that Taylor's diva demands seem to radiate off her queen in some real specific instances). But it's no failure by any means, and it's no disaster either. At the same time it also shoots short of greatness by not being, apparently, very well organized, with no complete script and its director re-writing scenes ala Godard the night before it was too be filmed. For what it's worth, some 45 years later, it's a fine achievement that isn't overrated and maybe just a tinge underrated.",Cleopatra
14,edwagreen,Cleopatra-A Snake in the Grass **1/2,5,17 April 2011,"Despite beautiful cinematography with the lavish sets, this 1963 film is a colossal failure. Tedious and ultimately boring, it just again proves that poor writing will do in any fine actor or actress, whether that be Rex Harrison, who received a best actor Oscar nomination as Julius Caesar, Richard Burton, as Mark Antony and the gorgeous, recently departed Elizabeth Taylor, as the seductive, vicious Cleopatra.Taylor's performance is absolutely pathetic here. At the beginning, she sounded almost churlish and her voice reflected her days in ""Butterfield 8,"" or the to-be ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" She improves after the assassination of Julius Caesar.The film takes in a lot of political considerations with the resulting entanglements. There is plenty of distorted history here. Roddy McDowell turns in an interesting performance as the overly-ambitious Augustus Caesar, heir to the dictatorshipIn summary, a totally disappointing effort. The assassination of Caesar certainly could have been better handled. It's as if they killed off the entire film.",Cleopatra
15,wes-connors,The Queen of Denial,6,3 February 2009,"Beautifully busted Elizabeth Taylor (as Cleopatra) copulates with seething lover Richard Burton (as Mark Antony), after godly lover Rex Harrison (as Julius Caesar) becomes indisposed. The threesome do not perform their best work; and, neither of the men pair very memorably with Ms. Taylor. Off screen, Taylor and Mr. Burton were lovers - but, that ""chemistry"" doesn't show. Taylor had proved herself a worthy actress up until ""Cleopatra"" - but, in this role, she faltered. Most of the time, she is modeling rather than acting. In fact, Taylor was beyond this role (which should have been offered to someone like Sophia Loren); but, the money was good Despite all that, the film is incredibly gorgeous. The reputation of ""Cleopatra"" as either a flop or failure isn't entirely true. Its flaws are obvious, but so are its strengths. The ""Academy Awards"" for cinematography, sets, costumes, and special effects are earned (more or less). Roddy McDowall (as Octavian) should have received a ""Best Supporting Actor"" nomination, also. Writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz and crew do not create an extraordinary finished product; but, there are individual scenes and sequences of great beauty.

16,sunwarrior13,An Entertainment Flick From Taylor And Burton,8,11 November 2011,"Cleopatra is a epic drama film stars Elizabeth Taylor in the title role.The film tells the story of the struggles of Cleopatra VII, the young Queen of Egypt, to resist the imperialist ambitions of Rome.Together with Liz Taylor,it also stars Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowall, and Martin Landau.The film was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz.While the screenplay was adapted by Sidney Buchman, Ben Hecht, Ranald MacDougall, and Mankiewicz from a book by Carlo Maria Franzero entitled,""The Life and Times of Cleopatra"".The music score was by Alex North while the cinematography was done by Leon Shamroy and an uncredited Jack Hildyard.Cleopatra follows the eighteen years that led to the founding of the Roman Empire. The Queen of Egypt,Cleopatra VII, meets up with Julius Caesar and plans to lure Caesar to her boudoir in order to forge an alliance with Rome so that she may hold on to her Egyptian empire. When Caesar is stabbed to death in the Roman Senate, Cleopatra is left without an ally, and Egypt is up for grabs. When Roman general Mark Antony comes along, she seduces him in order to make him over into her new protector. But, under the charms of Cleopatra, Mark Antony is reduced from a an awesome and dominating general to a sniveling, drunken wimp. At the Battle of Actium, Mark Antony is defeated and Cleopatra withdraws her troops, dooming him and his army. With Egypt in peril, Antony and Cleopatra, the doomed lovers, meet each other for the last time, as the enemy forces close in.Cleopatra is an display of cinema opulence as it tries to recreate a historical epic during the times of the Roman Empire.The costumes were simply awesome and the musical score was outstanding.It was definitely the most expensive movie during its time of release especially after Taylor was awarded a $1 million contract to make the movie.Unfortunately,despite the expenses for production values,the story become somewhat boring as it became talky and verbose.Also,the pacing was slow that one may lose interest in this almost 4-hour film.Overall,Cleopatra turned into an entertainment flick from both Taylor and Burton instead of a historical epic that could have provided a landmark for cinema excellence in the future.",Cleopatra
17,hitchcockthelegend,On Your Knees!,8,9 May 2013,"On your knees! It's something that Cleopatra her self shouts at a stunned Mark Antony, but it could quite literally have been shouted by many in Hollywood at 20th Century Fox as their gargantuan epic threatened to sink them. The trials and tribulations surrounding the film are stuff of legend, all of which makes for a film itself, but I will not go over old ground, there's a couple of great documentaries available out there and they are required viewing. They also help to explain somewhat why Cleopatra is not the genre defining classic many hoped it would be. Truth is is that no film could have lived up to the expectation that surrounded Cleopatra, as it is, with flaws and all, it's still a enjoyably lavish spectacle, harking back to a time when grandiose meant something. In fact a time of film making we could do with in today's day and age of retreads, remakes and soppy sequels.Split in to two narratives, that of Caesar & Cleopatra and Antony & Cleopatra, film basically deals with how Rome sought to conquer Egypt as Cleopatra clung on grimly in power and affairs of the heart. A cast of quality thespians stand straight backed and deliver the plot machinations, set to the backdrop of magnificent ornate sets, period costuming, piercing photography and a pulse pounding musical score. Quite simply the grandeur and scope is stunning in its presentation. Not all the dialogue works, and there are passages of exchanges that come off as undernourished; while soap operatics take a hold in the second part of the film. Yet for the historical epic fan there is just too much that is great for this to be ignored or considered a stinker. From Rex Harrison - Elizabeth Taylor - Richard Burton & Roddy McDowall, to the opulence seeping from every pore, Cleopatra is a joyous eye opening experience. Yes! Flaws and all. 8/10",Cleopatra
18,Doylenf,"An overstuffed turkey, opulent but induces drowsiness after first 45 minutes...",5,8 October 2006,"If it hadn't been the tabloid headlines screaming about the love affair between ELIZABETH TAYLOR and RICHARD BURTON on the set of CLEOPATRA in Rome, it's unlikely Fox would have released this epic without trimming even more than they did. It still doesn't work. The trims were not enough and the film is a boring mess by the time it reaches the end of its first forty-five minutes.Let's face it, Elizabeth Taylor sounds like a shrill fish wife whenever her emotions show any temperament--in other words, her vocal abilities are not good enough to carry the role of a woman who commanded all of Egypt with her willpower and determination and cunning. She's much better in other contemporary roles, but ill suited to play the Queen of Egypt. REX HARRISON gives the only full-bodied performance in the film and unfortunately he's killed midway and is missing from the rest of this gargantuan bore.Technical brilliance in costumes and sets cannot atone for a bad script and some lifeless performances from a large cast. Only RODDY McDOWALL emerges triumphant as Octavius (probably one of his best adult roles), but RICHARD BURTON is another casualty as a supposedly impassioned Marc Antony.Cleopatra's eye-filling entrance makes a stunning cinematic treat, but Taylor in later years confessed that she was sick upon seeing the film at a premiere and has since confided that she hates it. I can understand why, even if legions of her fans still think it's one of the best things she ever did. Sorry, I just can't see it that way, much as I love Liz in her best work.",Cleopatra

A Conundrum You Say. Well No. The Movie Cost so much that the Revenue could Not be Recovered, at least until a Future Date, too Late to Salvage the Studio System and Fox's Lingering Time ""In the Red"".Truth be Told, Nothing could have saved the Studio System. By the Mid-Sixties the Cultural Changes were Virtually Clueless to Major Motion Picture Studios that were being Exposed as Bloated, Myopic, Greedy, Dictatorial Dinosaurs and were being Out Performed at the Box-Office by Inexpensive Independent Movies that were Cutting Edge and Culturally Hip.So the Studio System Died of ""Future Shock"" and a Lack of Insight about Expanding Consciousness and Art as Commerce.Forget all the Misplaced Blame put on this Gorgeous, Eye-Candy of a Film. It also Tickles the Ear and Tweaks Intellectual Cravings about Empires of Antiquity and the Politics and People who Ruled these Gargantuan Conglomerates of Defeated People and Their Assimilation into what was then a ""Practical"" Notion of World Domination.The Movie is Infamous for its ""Liz and Dick"" Tabloid Tussles and Scandal Sheet Salaciousness and the Cost Overrides and Daily Troubles on the Set, mostly because of the Enormity of Everything.What is Impressive, along with the Obvious Beauty of it All, is that the Movie was Made with Organics.

Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton successfully - if a little too theatrically - carry off their portion of this epic tale of the life of probably the world's most famous woman of antiquity. Rex Harrison, much less so as Caesar - but combined I think this is actually a far better film than the critics at the time declared. The cinematography and scale of the production are unsurpassed as are the costumes, and married with Alex North's suitably orchestral score, you really do get a sense of the opulence and grandeur of Cleopatra's court. Unfortunately, the supporting cast - Roddy McDowell; Martin Landau and Andrew Keir in particular don't quite cut it and so the story sort of fizzles out towards the end. Nonetheless, we will never see the likes of a film like this again and we ought to celebrate that.",Cleopatra
21,writers_reign,Three On The Nile,7,6 June 2008,"It is, of course, impossible to approach this film as just another release in a typical week because for better or worse it comes with baggage - the original director fired, ditto original writers, escalating production problems, the world press feeding frenzy surrounding the Burton-Taylor offscreen romance and last but not least Mank staying up all night to write the screenplay and then shooting all day. In some cases, notably Casablanca and The Blue Dahlia, writers staying one camera setup ahead of shooting can produce brilliant results but even Mank couldn't quite hit paydirt here. A child could discern the difference between the first half which explores Cleopatra's relationship with Caesar and the second in which Marc Anthony takes up the running and the only conclusion to be reached is that Mank was more sympathetic to the first relationship - he had, of course, already offered his own take on Julius Caesar in 1952 (trivia buffs will note that John Hoyt appeared in both movies) and more or less phoned in the Tony and Cleo segment. There are those who will savor the irony of third-rate joke actors like Martin Benson sharing a screen with Burton - though to be fair the way Burton walks through his part it's no more than he deserves. On balance this is a film that should be seen and allowances made for virtually all involved from Mank downwards who had done so much better and would, in some cases, do so again.",Cleopatra
22,utgard14,"""You, a descendant of generations of inbred, incestuous, mental defectives!""",4,2 August 2015,"Notorious epic about Cleopatra was, at the time, the most expensive movie ever made. It was also the biggest flop ever and it almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox. Today it's not much more than a historical curio that challenges the viewer to watch the entire thing in one sitting. It took me three viewings over the course of twenty years before I could finally do it. On the positive side, the movie looks gorgeous with fantastic sets and costumes. The acting is acceptable across the board but it certainly wouldn't have hurt if the movie had a few more hams to keep things interesting. The biggest problem (but not the only one) is the film's overlength. Different cuts of this range from three to over four hours. The version I just watched was a little over four. Today we've been forced to become used to movies regularly clocking in at two and a half to three hours. I won't get into my opinions on that here but I will say that this is a whole different kind of 'long' than today's viewers are used to. Simply put, this is one of the most boring movies ever made. I would only recommend it to die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans. She was never lovelier than she is here. If you do decide to watch this, here's a tip: try keeping count of Liz's costume changes.

As a serious piece of film, it's far too wooden and dull to appeal to cinephiles; but for the same reasons, it doesn't even satisfy those looking for trashy camp.In terms of its physical production, ""Cleopatra"" takes the ""more is better"" approach, and stuffs every frame with gawdy set and costume details. Everything about the film is enormous; as a result, all of the actors are buried beneath a hopeless pile of Technicolor. Everyone walks around delivering stiff speeches, but no one really develops a character. The only person who manages to infuse the film with some life is Rex Harrison, so his departure from the film at the half-way point (with 2+ hours still to go!) is utterly demoralizing. The film grinds to a slower and slower pace as the remainder progresses, like an unwound music box, until by the end you can almost literally hear the DVD player laboring to spin the DVD around.This stinker landed with a huge thud at the time of its release, and it lands with a thud now.

25,AlsExGal,"For something that nearly bankrupted Fox, this is a very good movie",8,28 August 2021,"An absolute fiction of an epic very very loosely based on the life of Queen Cleopatra of Egypt with Elizabeth Taylor in the title role, this film has a fantastic score that should have won the Oscar, great acting, fabulous art design and a cast of thousands. If this had been made 23 years before, like epic Gone with the Wind, maybe it would have been less trouble. The studios had more control over personnel in those days, to the detriment of the welfare of personnel, and thus could keep costs down. This film had the misfortune of being made as the studio system was in its death throes. It ultimately had three directors.Richard Zanuck - put in charge after his father regained control of Twentieth Century Fox - actually had to shut down Fox to deal with the bad financial shape it was in at the time Cleopatra was in production. And then there was the Taylor/Burton affair that finally busted up the shaky Taylor/Fisher marriage. Hey Eddie (Fisher), like they say, what goes around goes around. The film did make money, and It's a fiction that it was a bomb at the time. It was number one at the box office for several weeks. But it just barely made up its stratospheric production cost, even after being sold for television broadcast.As for the production itself - It is interesting to see the dynamic between the lead players. Rex Harrison's Julius Caesar approaches Cleopatra from a standpoint of strength. And yet, before she becomes involved, she learns of his secret by observing one of his epileptic seizures when he thinks that he is alone. So you could say his vulnerability attracts her. In contrast, after Caesar's death, Burton's Anthony always seems to reach her after confessing weakness - that he is confused by politics and its subtlety, that he is at a loss for words when it comes to her, that he feels guilty for not having died with his men in battle at one point. She is the strong one in this relationship for sure, but in both relationships - the one with Julius Caesar and the one with Anthony - it seems to be a vulnerability that incites her passion. I wonder if this is how Taylor was directed to play it?Roddy McDowell excels as the wily Octavian. Martin Landau is endearing as Anthony's soldier friend, loyal to the very end. Hume Cronyn is the father figure/wise advisor to Cleopatra. He played good guys and villains with skill over the years and was very underrated in my opinion. This epic holds up and I'd recommend it. But you will need to set aside four hours to see the whole thing.",Cleopatra

27,HotToastyRag,The movie that got them together!,3,19 July 2017,"Cleopatra is famous for many reasons, but it's not generally well-liked. Obviously, casting Elizabeth Taylor to play one of the world's most beautiful women, and cladding her in unspeakably beautiful costumes, is one reason this movie has been remembered. Liz was married at the time to Eddie Fisher, a union that cost her her reputation, but that couldn't stop the sparks from flying between her and her married costar, Richard Burton. Once again, Liz became a homewrecker, and her love affair and marriage to Burton is one of the most famous of all Hollywood couples.Also, Cleopatra was the most expensive film ever made at the time. It cost $44 million, and almost bankrupted the studio. Can you imagine a world without 20th Century Fox? Audiences at the time felt it was too long and too wordy, but modern audiences won't feel that way. We're used to long epics, like Gladiator and Alexander, so the four-hour running time won't be a hindrance. And watching Liz and Dick fall in love on camera is magical; ""boring"" just isn't an applicable adjective.I wouldn't call Cleopatra a must-see, unless you're particularly attached to that Hollywood couple, but it is a spectacle. If you like epics, or if you like your films to have glorious splendor, you're not going to want to miss this one.",Cleopatra
28,JamesHitchcock,"Did for the epic what ""Heaven's Gate"" did for the Western",7,28 May 2020,"""Cleopatra"" did for the epic in the early sixties what ""Heaven's Gate"" did for the Western in the early eighties. At the time it was the most expensive film ever made, costing around three times the amount of the previous record holder, the 1959 ""Ben-Hur"". The massive cost overruns involved in its production almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox. The film's financial problems were partly caused by the fact that its star, Elizabeth Taylor, was taken seriously ill during production, leading to a lengthy delay; Joan Collins was canvassed as her replacement. In the event Taylor recovered and Collins was not needed, but the delay meant that the original Caesar, Peter Finch, and the original Anthony, Stephen Boyd, had to leave the production due to other commitments. They were replaced by Rex Harrison and Richard Burton, and their scenes had to be reshot. The original director Rouben Mamoulian was sacked and replaced by Joseph Mankiewicz.Even after Taylor's return to health, the film's troubles were not over. Taylor's romance with Burton brought much publicity, but as both were already married to other people this was the sort of publicity the film could have done without. Mankiewicz's original cut was an insane six hours long. He unsuccessfully tried to persuade the studio to release this version as two three-hour films, one dealing with Cleopatra's relationship with Caesar and the other with her relationship with Antony, but this option was rejected. The six-hour version was cut down to a single four-hour film for the premiere, and this was further cut to just over three hours for the version released in cinemas. My comments are based upon the four-hour version, which I saw recently; l have not seen the three-hour one for many years. The four-hour version is admittedly overlong, and although we cannot know how Mankiewicz's idea of two shorter films would have turned out, it strikes me as an elegant and feasible solution.Nor can we know what the film would have been like had it been made with Finch and Boyd rather than Harrison and Burton (or, for that matter, if Taylor had been replaced by Collins). Harrison, however, is very good as Caesar. When I recently reviewed ""You Were Never Lovelier"" I said that there were certain actors, such as Bogart, Gable, Grant, Stewart and Peck, who could make older man-younger woman love stories seem both natural and plausible, and Harrison is another to add to that list. The relationship between his Caesar and Cleopatra is similar to that between his Professor Higgins and Audrey Hepburn's Eliza in ""My Fair Lady"", a mixture of father-figure and tutor, except that here he is tutoring the younger woman in statecraft rather than elocution and phonetics. This relationship is very different to the tumultuous physical passion which exists between Cleopatra and Burton's Antony.Taylor is not really at her best here. Perhaps she was still affected by her illness, or possibly she was feeling the strain caused by the publicity given to her relationship with Burton or to her status as the first ""million-dollar actress"". (She was the first actress to be paid $1,000,000 for appearing in a movie). Nevertheless, some of her off-screen physical passion for Burton does come through in their on-screen scenes together. I doubt if Burton and Collins would have been so convincing; they had acted together several years earlier in ""Sea Wife"" and she had taken a dislike to him.Not all the money spent on this film was wasted. In the best epic tradition there is plenty of spectacle on display- the battle scenes, particularly the sea battle of Actium, Caesar's triumphal entry into Rome, Cleopatra on her barge. Yet ""Cleopatra"" was one of the last of a dying breed. Together with the equally unsuccessful ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" from the following year, it effectively killed off the Classical epic, even though only a few years earlier ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" had enjoyed great success. The genre was not revived until the late nineties and early 2000s, and even then films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"" were very different in style to their predecessors in the fifties and early sixties.My verdict on ""Cleopatra"" would be the same as that on the much-maligned ""Heaven's Gate"", namely that, judged on its artistic merits, is not at all bad. Yes, it is a product of a vanished era. Yes, it lost a lot of money. That, however, should not prevent us from enjoying it for what it is. We should always beware of judging a film, or any other work of art, on the basis of the profit-and-loss account. 7/10",Cleopatra
29,lasttimeisaw,Cleopatra,6,22 October 2010,"When rumor says that James Cameron is going to shoot a new CLEOPATRA with Angelina Jolie, coincidently I was watching Elizabeth Taylor's 1963 version, whose fame is spread through its anecdotes more than the film itself. Speaking of the film, even after 50 years, one still cannot help gasping to breathe when sees all the spectacular settings, and most of the time, nevertheless, I was in a state of admiring clothes, buildings, props, small decorations and left the story behind, the glamorous vanity does some counter-force to undermine the story itself.The film lasts more than four hours and is divided into two parts, the first half is between Cleopatra & Cesar, the latter half is between Cleopatra & Antony, simple and clear. Interestingly only Rex Harrison got an Oscar nomination for BEST ACTOR that year and the love/hate intertwined couple Elisabeth and Richard got nothing at all, whose real life story was even more appealing than the tragic Cleopatra. There is no doubt I prefer the first half, the tension before Cesar and Cleopatra is exhilarating, compared to the second half, when everything turns into a vaguely kitsch love tragedy, at least the first part is much more convincing. When the story became kind of funny and unbelievable, I lost my patience, the sea battle is missing its point, cost a huge fortune to make, how come there is no single exciting battlefield, maybe it's Elizabeth Taylor's will to make her the only focus, no one else should take her thunder, sadly she managed it and it is 20th Century Fox paid for the extra bills for her lavishly bloated showcasing. If Cameron is surely to make a new version, Angelina Jolie is a sure-fire, but make sure that it is the director who makes the decision instead of actors.

Some of the action scenes in the movie were quite exciting and their was some sexy romantic moments as well.I would not mind watching another movie about Cleopatra if it looked good too me.

The tragic story of the life of Queen Cleopatra as her triumphs of power and love are dramatically depicted in the movie: Elizabeth Taylor gave a stunning performance as the Queen and Richard Burton gave a powerful portrayal of Mark Antony. I remembered being shocked by the suspense and mayhem when Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) was stabbed to death, thinking why would a powerful king be assassinated, and remembered being a little sad seeing Cleopatra deliberately let a poisonous snake bite her to death.

33,theowinthrop,A Story That Always Fascinates - No Matter How Many Versions We See Of It.,9,29 March 2007,"The tale of the last great ruler of Ancient Egypt, Cleopatra, has been the subject of many films. Theda Bara played her in 1917. That version (if it still exists) is rarely seen - and if it were the broad gestures of early silent movies would probably strike us as funny. Nearly twenty years later, in 1934, Claudette Colbert did a wonderful job as the Queen of the Nile under the guidance of Cecil B. DeMille. In 1946 England produced CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA with Claude Rains sharing acting honors with Vivien Leigh, to dialog by Bernard Shaw. Finally came this 1963 version - which is different from most of the others (the 1946 is the closest to it for a different reason).The 1963 version with Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and Rex Harrison is remembered for the beginning of the Taylor - Burton relationship which destroyed their respective marriages, and got more news coverage than any items of that period except for the Cuban Missile Crisis and the assassination of President Kennedy. The film is also remembered for being (up to that time) the most expensive ""flop"" film of American movie history. It cost (in 1963 money) twenty five million dollars, which was nearly twenty two million over original budget. Which is why the 1946 version is also so similar - it was the most expensive film of the British cinema up to that time, and it too was a box office flop.The film was a mess - it was started without decent control of budget and cast from 20th Century Fox's leadership. The original filming was in England under Rouben Mamoulian, but he got no where with his stars (they included Peter Finch as Caesar and Stephen Boyd as Anthony). He was replaced by Joseph Mankiewicz, at the demand of Taylor (who had worked well with him on SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER). Mankiewicz tried to give coherence to the script - and eventually created a plan for a six hour, two part movie first about Cleopatra and her romance with Gaius Julius Caesar, and then her relationship with Marc Anthony. Mankiewicz apparently shot that much (or almost that much) but the leadership at 20th Century Fox was changed, and Darryl Zanuck returned to command. Zanuck insisted on a single long film - the four hour version that most of us have seen.Despite the cuts, the remaining film is quite a worthy one. It is attacked as pompous because the dialog is more formal than ours - it is based on Plutarch, Suetonius, and other ancient Latin and Greek historians, as well as Shakespeare (and a little of Shaw). But the basic story of the princess who fought her way to the oldest throne in the ancient world, and twice came close to being the lover/wife of the most powerful man in the Roman Empire. The supporting cast is fine, including Hume Cronym as an Egyptian adviser to Taylor, and (possibly the best performance) Roddy MacDowell as Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) who is a compound of brains, suspicions, and respect for his foes. Look at the end when he berates a soldier for dismissing Anthony as a drunken failure, reminding the soldier that he was one of Rome's greatest soldiers.Mankiewicz may lack De Mille's gift for special effects (only eight years after THE TEN COMMANDMENTS) but there were no miracles in the tale of Cleopatra - she used her wiles, her intelligence, her looks to beguile to powerful men, who also saw her as a key to their own ambitions. So there was no ""parting of the Red Sea"" here. But there is a fine production of the naval battle at Actium to really climax the second part of the story.For all the expense, the ego clashes, and the pompous language, CLEOPATRA remains a good epic film retelling of a remarkable ancient figure and her world. It's nice to note that after twenty years, it finally made a small profit from television rentals, foreign distribution, and later videos and DVDs.",Cleopatra
34,ElMaruecan82,Hollywood remaking History and History remaking Hollywood...,9,11 October 2021,"""Cleopatra""... it's not much what that title contains than what it evokes, something about the famous and the infamous, the agony and the ecstasy (agony underscored) of making movies, something about a scale of such gigantic proportions it nearly bankrupted a studio ... a film that has ""epic"" written all over its legacy, from its legendary cast, its luxuriant variety of set-designs and costumes to the number of zeros that kept avalanching in the cost sheets... a film that was both the highest grossing of the year and the least profitable, the kind of tragic ironies only History could rival with.Caesar used to say ""for the time being"" but movies like ""Cleopatra"" aren't made for their time but a certain end-vision of posterity that would justify all the means, including the sacrifices of several players whose lives wouldn't emerge unscathed from the project. Yes, for the sake of one film; couples would be formed, homes would be wrecked, careers would be destroyed and a few kickstarted, including critic Judith Crist who called the film a 'monumental mouse' providing the reverse effect than Pauline Kael's iconic praise of ""Bonnie and Clyde"". And speaking of 1967, ""Cleopatra"" is precisely the film I kept mentioning in several reviews as the one that put an end to the studio system and allowed my all-time favorite sequence to emerge: New Hollywood.Still, ""Old Hollywood"" was quite a deal and ""Cleopatra"" the last mohican of a breed of films that wouldn't resurface after more than two decades and then would be spoiled and soiled by CGI, a genre incarnated by the figure of the legendary queen whose (arguable) beauty changed the face of the world by reshaping the entire political system of Rome. It was said that ""if her nose was shorter, the whole face of the world would have changed"" how fitting that the same can almost be said about the film. No cinephile can ignore the legacy of Joseph Mankiewicz' film, a school-case of mismanagement, of worst-case scenarios and desperate attempts to compact a six-hour epic into a pseudo love triangle, counting on the personalities of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor the first actress to get one million dollars to star in a movie.Taylor would later dismiss the film, deploring that the cutting deprived the film from its soul, probably inspiring the scathing critic of Crist, but who can imagine another actress as the legendary queen? Taylor was a prima-donna for real, Burton as tormented and under the spell of Liz than his counterpart Marc-Anthony with Cleo and Rex Harrison had that regal quiet force that justified his Oscar-nomination. The casting is integral to the film's success, Roddy McDowall is sumptuous as the frail but sneaky Octavius who'd win by default from favorable circonstances, Martin Landau makes a remarkable right-hand man as Rufio, second-in-command, Hume Cronyn is reliable as Sisogenes and Richard O'Sullivan as the treacherous Ptolemei XIII manages to steal the show by being the exact opposite of Rex Harrison.Some criticized the film for being too grand, too majestic, too pompous to allow us to get in the depths of the character who act their ranks but maybe not their roles.hat's an unfair trial for Burton is at home with this kind of tortmented characters torn between their duty and loyalty and the temptations, Taylor was called ""an entirely physical creature"", but since she used her seduction as a political tool, her physicality works like the same continuation than the pistol for John Wayne, it is one-dimensional to the degree that you choose to ignore that these are people preceded by their reputation and a vast cohort of chariots, dancers or slaves pulling a huge sphynx. They're so larger-than-life than even the most auteurist director wouldn't efficiently confine them in the frivolities of domestic lifes, these are characters meant for tragedies and grand poses, and can't be confronted to lines such as ""I love you"" or ""how are you doing""... and it's good enough that within the epic scope of the film, we can get a few moments of genuine complicity, one little wink speaking as many words as a long monologue.Anyway at the end audiences didn't care for the missing parts, nor about the whole chaos that went behind the making, Taylor's near-death sickness that delayed the production and supposedly earned her first Oscar, they didn't know about the weeks wasted because the English weather couldn't render a believable Rome, let alone Alexandria, like Caesar, they came, they saw and let the film conquer their hearts. They didn't care that names such as Mankiewicz, Walter Wanger, Spyros Skouras or Eddie Fischer would curse these films forever, those are collateral damages that cemented the film's history. They cared for the film and that's what mattered but we modern viewers know about the film's tormented making and for some reason, that makes it even more legendary.The film isn't flawless of course and maybe it lacks one true battle sequence, but like its then-rival ""Ben-Hur"", it had its chariots race scene in the glorious entrance of Cleopatra in Rome, one of the most spectacular moments of cinema's history that makes you as dazzled as if you were there, Roman extras were shouting ""Bacio Liz"", talk about reality overshadowing fiction, it's the star playing the star of her time and a tragic disaster coming to another one. But so many moments from the bath sequence to the entrance, that would prompt Asterix writer and drawer to make immediately a comic-book about Asterix and Cleopatra and whose album cover parodied the film and inspired five years later the best cartoon adaptation ever. Yes, even as a fan of Asterix, I enjoyed ""Cleopatra"", perhaps the least loved of all the epics, one that didn't even have an entry in the AFI's Top 10 Epics... maybe because the film left such a trauma... but better an epic disaster than a moderate success....",Cleopatra

I watched this movie for Shakespeare Month because I heard it was based on ""Antony And Cleopatra"". The weird thing is that it's kind of hard to really say that because it's based on a true story. It seems more like historical drama than a Shakespeare adaptation. I still think it counts and I'm glad to have checked this out. Hey, I've now seen every movie at the moment that I want to see for 1963! Well, both history and Shakespeare buffs should know the story already. It seems like it's been a long time since I saw an accurate representation of the historical Cleopatra. The funny thing about her is that she became famous for being able to seduce men. Despite being portrayed by the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor here, the actual Cleopatra was actually kind of ugly with a hooked nose. Well, it's been said she at least had a nice voice. The best parts were of course the war and action sequences.I admit it probably is too long and could have been cut in half. Still, we get a lot of really talented actors here and they really are putting a lot of effort into their roles. This is one of the most expensive movies ever made, even adjusted for inflation and actually hit the studio even though it made a good amount of money. My general thought is that it's a good movie, but not a great movie. When you have a film over four hours long, you really have to made it enjoyable. This was a nice big epic film. ***",Cleopatra
36,cricketbat,"Starts off promising, but its ego gets in the way",7,3 September 2021,"Cleopatra, much like Julius Caesar's reign, starts off promising, but its ego eventually gets in the way and it grows tiresome. Nevertheless, Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely enchanting in her role as the iconic Egyptian ruler. In fact, when she's not in a scene, the movie becomes a little less interesting. While the extravagant sets & elaborate costumes are very impressive, this epic film could have used a little more humility.",Cleopatra
37,secondtake,"Gorgeous beyond expectation, and interesting if not quite gripping and moving",7,2 October 2017,"Cleopatra (1963)There is a lot to like in this movie, most of all the sets and costumes. And the rich color filming of those sets and costumes.. It is a movie of pageantry and beauty. And stately exposition, where these backdrops and colors unfold.I repeat—this visual effect is extraordinary. The plot, however, as a mishmash of historical events from around this time. It is often stiff, the admittedly dramatic events being told with a same reverence for beauty over drama. And there was so much drama to be mined. It's a shame that somehow the pronouncements couldn't have been less staged and more naturally fluid. Director Joseph Mankiewitz is one of my favorites from the 1950s, giving tightly scripted soap opera drama to beautifully filmed events (as in ""All About Eve""), but the larger scenes overwhelm any subtle intent. Maybe it is partly that he came into the filming party way through (in a famously troubled production).Of course, there is Cleoptra herself, played by Elizabeth Taylor with a modern (very 1963) verve. She's terrific. And when Richard Burton finally speaks (over an hour into the film) he brings his known strength to his scenes. Caesar is played with beautifully formal disdain and cleverness by Rex Harrison (Rex meaning king, appropriately). This basic threesome makes the movie.Above and beyond is the sets and costumes, which is really what the public seemed to eat up in the 1960s. The vivid sharpness of 70mm film, and the saturation of true Technicolor, were far beyond the best color television of the time (or ours, technically speaking). My blu-ray copy on a decent monitor made for mouthwatering visuals. I watched even if I was a bit impatient for things to unfold more meaningfully. The very long pageantry 2/3 the way through—I mean a full half hour of large crowds and ceremonial whatnot—is a sign of why the movie falters beyond the mise-en-scene.And why it was so expensive to make. I looked up the history of the time, and found that it was truly amazing stuff, which of course Shakespeare and others knew, too. Cleopatra is a stunning leader, a woman in an age of male leaders. (She was Greek, in Egypt, at the end of centuries of Greek power there.) Antony and Ceaser are of course important, too, in this pivotal time (40 or so years BC), but it is the title character, through Liz Taylor, who rises out of the crowded masses.See it expecting something a bit dry and dull, even if extremely well made.",Cleopatra

Everything from the clunky sets, the awful and tuneless musical score, to the campy acting mixed in with a heavy dose of self-importance adds up to a total waste of 4 hours(!!!!!!!!).Please do not waste your whole afternoon (usually Sundays) watching this on TV. Come 8 o'clock you'll regret that you wasted the weekend. It's the kind of film your grandmother would insist on watching only because it's old and therefor must be better than all the modern stuff she has grown distant from.I really must stress again this is a pile of crap.",Cleopatra
39,vincentlynch-moonoi,Obsession with minutae and overacting by Richard Burton,7,8 December 2015,"There's a lot of great things in this film...and two negatives, but the negatives -- though substantial -- do not overwhelm the overall production.The first negative: 4 hours and 8 minutes! Why was the film so long? In my view an obsession with minutiae. From what I've read, the film is more historically accurate than most such epics. But did we need so much detail? Does the detail get in the way of telling a good story? Despite a near obsession with Elizabeth Taylor in the early 1960s, this is just too long. It's a good example of when less actually improves understanding. I understand that there was some thought of dividing this into 2 films -- the first about Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, the second about Cleopatra and Mark Antony; in my view, that would have been the perfect solution, particularly because the film divides so perfectly upon Caesar's death and the ascension of Antony, and in approximately equal lengths.The second negative is Richard Burton's acting. Particularly when being expansive, Burton's style of acting probably worked very well on stage where one needs top be heard, but it doesn't work so well on film where one need not yell. Yelling rarely equals good acting.However, aside from those two downers, there's a lot of great stuff here. For one, it's a lush production...in fact, you can't help but wonder if the real historical settings looked anywhere near this good. The costumes, particularly Elizabeth Taylor's, are stunning.The rest of the acting -- aside from some of Burton's -- is top notch. This may be Taylor's pinnacle, although it's doubtful Cleopatra looked anything like Elizabeth Taylor. And it occurred to me -- could the leader of Rome and the Queen of Egypt communicate so easily in their different languages? I was more interested in the acting by Rex Harrison. I saw Harrison perform at the Kennedy Center one year, and believe it or not, I could barely hear him even though we were sitting in center-orchestra. Even the Washington Post noted the issue in their review of the play. So, I would have to say that film was more conducive to Harrison's talents...and here, he is superb. And I mean really superb. He dies almost exactly half way through the film, and it occurred to me that the studio could have easily divided the film into two parts, which was actually considered, and they would have made twice the profit by releasing them separately. At any rate, despite enjoying Harrison's performance immensely, I was sorely disappointed in the scenes relating to the assassination of Caesar. Instead of in ""real time"", the event is seen -- without speech -- through the eyes of a fortune teller. Harrison was robbed of the dialog in what could have been his best scene.I have never been impressed with Roddy McDowall, and was not here in his role as Octavian.Although it was not a large part, I particularly enjoyed the role played by the wonderful Hume Cronyn. And it was interesting to see Carroll O'Connor in a very different role than Archie Bunker -- as a Roman senator. Martin Landau, whom I generally did not care for, was very good here as an officer under Caesar and Marc Antony.The first half of this film relies on superb acting by Elizabeth Taylor and Rex Harrison. The second half of this film relies on superb acting by Elizabeth Taylor and the drama of Marc Antony's spiraling descent toward death.On balance, a good film, although just for the record -- odd how almost all the Egyptians were White people!",Cleopatra
40,clanciai,"The ordeals of Julius Caesar, Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, while she actually triumphed even over Augustus",10,15 July 2020,"No matter how much this film has been depreciated, despized, discarded and frowned at for its extravagance, exaggerations, historical incorrectness, theatrical bathos, and financial disaster, there is really nothing you can say against it. Even Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who made and wrote the film, was deeply unhappy about it and regarded it as the worst film he had ever made and considered it almost his one great failure, but all such denigrations of it are totally unjust. You can understand Mankiewicz and his disappointment that it didn't turn out according to his wishes and intentions, he wanted to make two different films of it of tthree hours each, but the producers insisted on making it all one and cut out two hours of it, that so far never have been restored and still wait for some resurrection. Of course, there are some historical inaccuracies, there has to be in every historical film, but they are not very blatant here. The main incorrectness is the character of Octavian, he did not spear that Egyptian ambassador, and that whole scene is objectionable, although Roddy MacDowell is perfect as Octavian in every other way, he is the same kind of type, he manages to look like him, and he almost got a well deserved Oscar for it but missed it by mistake. Rex Harrison got an Oscar and he is the best actor in the film, like also the first part is the better part, but it is generally missed that Richard Burton actually is almost even more perfect as Mark Athony: Caesar's closest man was like that in reality, brutal and capricious, coarse and unreliable, a man of violence rather than of love and politics, and his marriage with Octavia, Octavian's sister, is rendered very accurately in the film. Also Elizabeth Taylor has been rather abused for her performance, while she actually makes one of the best performances of her life, although historically not quite correct - Cleopatra is an enigma which no one really has quite understood, and extremely little is known about her private and love life, since as a queen to every inch she was expert at discretion. Martin Landau also makes a sustainedly impressive performance and is perhaps the fourth best actor of the film. Above all, it's a tremendously beautiful film, especially the first part, and Alex North's music means much to it and adds an indispensable and unforgettable extra dimension of beauty and charm. It is one of the most expensive films ever made, but it was not a flop, although a financial disappointment, like so many other excellent films - Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' for one. The mass scenes are monumentally impressive, especially Cleopatra's spectacular arrival in Rome, but also the battle of Actium is admirably realized and true to reality - it shows how it actually happened, with Octavian sleeping himself through it, and everything. I saw it 40 years ago and already then marked the music as especially memorable, while this one of the greatest films ever made gave so much more and made an even more thoroughly deep impression of beauty after 40 years.",Cleopatra
41,Red-125,"Burton, Taylor, and a cast of thousands",9,26 September 2014,"Cleopatra (1963) was co-written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. This movie is still famous. It was immensely popular when it was released, and is still definitely worth seeing 50 years later. (Incidentally, it wasn't a flop. People lined up to see it. It just didn't make much money, because the production costs were so outrageously high.)I'm going to stick to the basics in this review. If I start with ""the highest paid this, the most expensive that, the largest number of those,"" the review will turn into a book. Everyone knows that Taylor and Burton fell in love during the filming. At that time, this was a great scandal. Now, it probably would still make news, but we are glutted with scandal, and nobody is surprised by it.Although everyone was dazzled by her beauty, Elizabeth Taylor could act. (She was nominated for an Oscar five times, and won twice.) Harrison and Burton were both acknowledged as fine actors, and these roles didn't really force them to go down new and different paths. However, to my mind, acting honors go to Roddy McDowall as Octavian (Caesar Augustus). Burton and Harrison play characters who are ruled by their hearts. McDowell plays a character who has no heart. It's hard to describe the lavishness of this production. There really was a cast of thousands. The sea battle scenes are incredible, the interiors are majestic, and the sheer opulence of the costumes is impossible to describe. You really do have to see it to comprehend it.Harrison, Burton, McDowall. Costumes, extras, interiors, Cleopatra's barge, are all very fine. What the movie really has as its core is Liz Taylor. Her IMDb bio describes her beauty: ""Voluptuous figure, dark hair, violet eyes, pale skin."" Well, that's a start. When she's on the screen, with her extravagant eye makeup, her hair braided with gold, and her glorious costumes, you can't take your eyes off her.Viewers in 1963 couldn't know about the eight marriages, the weight problems, or the Michael Jackson connection. All of that was in the future and is now in the past. It will be sad if we only remember Elizabeth Taylor when she was a caricature of what she had been when she played Cleopatra. In the movie--and in history--great men risked empires to be with Cleopatra. And, when Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, it's easy to see why.This film cries out for a large screen, but it's too long for most commercial movie houses, and it's not exactly an art film. So, you'll have to make do with the small screen. It's still worth seeing. See it in two sessions--Caesar and then Anthony. That's the way Mankiewicz conceived it, so it makes sense to view it that way now.Added note: The 2013 novel ""Beautiful Ruins,"" by Jess Walter, takes place (in part) during the filming of Cleopatra. (The other part takes place in the present.) The concept involves a young starlet who plays Iris, one of Cleopatra's servants. She is whisked off to a secluded hotel because of matters that occurred during the filming. In the novel, she's blonde. For many years, directors have portrayed one of Cleopatra's servants as being pale and blonde, in contrast to everyone else who has dark hair. The blonde starlet was hired to play that role, and then things went wrong.Now, the film version of ""Beautiful Ruins"" is in production. (I believe it will feature Imogen Poots as the starlet.) So, a novel about the filming of a movie is being turned into a movie. Could be interesting.",Cleopatra
42,filipemanuelneto,"A landmark of cinema, and a lesson on how not to edit a movie.",6,17 May 2016,"This film tells the story of the last Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, and how she used the romance and seduction to meet state reasons and seek to maintain the independence of her country. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, which also provides the script with Ranald MacDougall and Sidney Buchman, has Elizabeth Taylor in the role of Queen of the Nile, Richard Burton as Mark Antony, Rex Harrison as Caesar and Roddy McDowall as Octavian Augustus.This film was severely cut because it would have originally twice the length of the movie has today. It was a film thought to a time when going to the movies was something that lasted an entire afternoon, with long breaks to go to the coffee, socializing, and sometimes more than a movie showing. It's a pity that this film has been so severely amputated, because it lost much of the quality that initially had, and that justified the millions of dollars it cost. In fact, it was the most expensive film in history until very few years ago, and we need to consider that there wasn't computerized resources, everything was done the old fashioned way. Nevertheless, the script is good and kept some consistency, the dialogues and rather theatrical poses looks good in an epic production of this kind and most of the actors fulfill their role well, highlighting Taylor, with a well-aimed and seductive performance, and the most exquisite and detailed costumes that cinema has ever seen so far. Burton did well too, reaching perhaps the biggest movie of his career. The scenes depicting the battle of Actium were excellent and show all the ""technology"" that the film industry had at the time. The soundtrack of Alex North, while fulfilling it's role, disappointed me because of atonality chosen by the composer.This film is considered one of the most notable of Taylor and Burton's career's, marking this pair, who falls in love during filming, beginning a troubled marriage that cinema gossip still remember today. Apart from the excessive cuts made by the company, which withdrew the public the opportunity to appreciate this work in all it's splendor, it's a film that always worth viewing, and became still a landmark of the epic cinema.",Cleopatra
43,l_rawjalaurence,"The Narrative Sags, but Taylor Excels",8,25 December 2013,"What more can be said about a film which has attracted - and continues to attract - so much notoriety since its release half a century ago? Every aspect of its gestation, release, and subsequent reputation has been pored over by critics, biographers, fans and - more recently - bloggers alike. Sitting through Joseph L. Mankiewicz's three-hour epic once more, one is struck by its sheer scale; in the days before CGI, every detail of ancient Rome had to be painstakingly recreated, from the sets to the crowds thronging the piazzas of Rome and Egypt. The visual effect of what was created at Rome's Cinecitta studios is truly breathtaking - a triumph of design and staging. The film is less effective in terms of characterization: Rex Harrison offers us another take on his light comedy persona as Mark Antony, Richard Burton provides plenty of Welsh hwyl, while reminding us of his unique vocal qualities, while Roddy MacDowall is an effeminately evil Octavian (a performance that must have provided a template for Joaquin Phoenix's rendering of a similar role in Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR (2000)). For character actor fans, there's the pleasure of identifying other performers (Martin Landau, Robert Stephens, Pamela Brown) in small roles, but that experience does not really compensate for a narrative that sags badly in places. And what of Elizabeth Taylor? She doesn't so much give a performance as dominate the screen - in a wonderful array of costumes and make-up, she truly seems like someone whose face could have launched a thousand ships. Technically speaking, she might have given better performances but her Cleopatra is comprised of one hundred per cent star quality.",Cleopatra
44,strong-122-478885,The Face That Launched 1000 Ships,4,1 January 2015,"Cleopatra is definitely yet another film where what went on behind the scenes is far more interesting than the movie itself.What follows here is a brief (and I do mean 'brief') summary of some of the more delicious 'behind-the-scenes' highlights that took place.When Cleopatra was released in 1963 its production costs totalled a whopping $44 million, making it (at the time) the most expensive film in movie-history. If you were to adjust that $44 million to catch up with today's inflated prices it would be equivalent to about $300 million US, which would still make Cleopatra one of the most expensive films of all time.Filming for Cleopatra began early in 1960, but due to repeated set-backs (usually caused by actress Elizabeth Taylor) it took nearly 3 years to complete this film.Elizabeth Taylor had a total of 65 costume changes throughout the course of the film. If you consider the 4 hour running time of Cleopatra, that would mean that Taylor changed into a new costume about every 4 minutes.Believe it, or not, there is actually a scene in Cleopatra where one minute Taylor's wearing one outfit and, then, when the camera pans back to her, again, she's wearing something else. One of the dresses designed for Taylor was a truly dazzling creation made out of 24-carat gold cloth.When all of the legal wranglings were finally settled in regards to Cleopatra, Taylor ended up being paid $7 million for her role in this film.Filming for Cleopatra began in England. But due to Taylor's health she couldn't tolerate the climate there, so production was moved to Italy. All in all, the massive sets for the great city of Alexandria had to be built 3 times.Special guards had to be hired to prevent the womanizing Italian Extras from continually harassing all of the female Extras. These women literally had to go on strike to get this demand for protection enforced.Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton began their well-publicized love/hate relationship on the set of Cleopatra. This stupid on/off relationship of theirs' lasted until Burton's death in 1984. Taylor and Burton would eventually go on to make 11 pictures together - Most of them complete duds.Phew!! Need I go on? There really seems to be no end to this sort of crap.As you can well-imagine - With a 4 hour running time this 'Saga-Of-The-Nile' seems to go on, and on, and on, ad nauseum.If anything else - Cleopatra is, without question, a bona-fide curiosity piece that, nevertheless, earned itself Oscars for Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Special Effects.",Cleopatra
45,kevin_robbins,I really enjoy this movie every time I see it,10,20 July 2021,"Cleopatra (1993) is a movie I recently DVR'd and watched again for the first time in a long time. The storyline follows Cleopatra and her dreams of uniting the Egyptian and Roman empires and having a son that can eventually rule the world. She underestimates the fight for power in Rome, the consistent changing of the guard, and despite ruler after ruler liking her plans and preferring her direction, their inability to execute on it. Eventually she too may be at battle with Rome. This movie is directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Guys and Dolls) and stars Elizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof), Richard Burton(1984), Roddy McDowall (Fright Night), Martin Landau (North by Northwest) and John Hoyt (Spartacus). The settings and scenery in this are absolutely magnificent. There's a grandiose feel to the entire movie - from the parades, to the boat scenes, to the costumes, sets, props everything was huge and well done. The acting was excellent, especially by Taylor as she played cat and mouse with her male counterparts perfectly. The writing and dialogue in this is so clever and fitting, very believable and the use of metaphors, philosophies and analogies were excellent.

Taylor and the male leads do a convincing job with dialog that is engaging, informative and moves the meaty story along at a decent clip to help mask its immense length.

The director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, takes his time developing A LOT of characters and the first hour features a terrific performance by Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar. When Elizabeth Taylor shows up as the title role, the film starts to turn into a high gloss soap opera. Taylor is strikingly beautiful but lacks the acting talent to hold her own with either Harrison or Richard Burton, who appears in the second half as Marc Antony. Nonetheless, CLEOPATRA is exceedingly entertaining. Taylor and Burton have genuine chemistry and the classy supporting cast really shines: Roddy McDowell, Martin Landau and Hume Cronyn are all terrific.

48,Nazi_Fighter_David,For the splendid role of history's ultimate femme fatale the highest fee ever paid an actress up to then,8,15 April 2007,"Mankiewicz shaped the characterization to suit Liz Taylor's role... The movie follows her from the father-daughter romance with Caesar to the tempestuous man-woman contretemps with Marc Antony As the cunning, nubile daughter to Caesar's wise father, Liz is quite pleasing... She's expected to do much more acting as the womanly, passion-driven Queen, but she's more in control of the character when she's playing Caesar's pupil rather than Marc Anthony's teacher... Her high comedy exchanges with Harrison have quiet authority; her doomed romance with Burton never ignites The brilliant script by Mankiewicz covers the eighteen years leading up to the formation of the Roman Empire, starting with Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) meeting Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) in Egypt, when he arrives as conqueror, and ending with her suicide when defeated by Rome and when her Roman general and lover Mark Anthony (Richard Burton) also ends his life The visual content of the film is stunning, especially Cleopatra's entry into Rome, carried on a vast throne-platform and bringing with her the son sired into Tarsus, and the vast battle of Actium The sets and costumes are among the finest ever created for the screen, but it is the literacy of Mankiewicz's script and the strength of his direction that give Cleopatra distinctions of great importance",Cleopatra
49,slokes,Time Was Their Enemy,4,17 August 2014,"As legendary movie flops go, ""Cleopatra"" is not all that bad. It starts strong, presents intelligent dialogue and vibrant performances, and offers some of the most sumptuous, sensuous eye candy ever captured on film.But it also gets to be a right mess as it goes on. This is true not only for the viewer, but for the filmmakers and actors. Try to squeeze two legendary love stories with the fall of the Roman Republic as backdrop, and you are playing dice with both patience and time.After winning a bloody civil war, Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) repairs to Egypt, in the midst of its own fratricide. Queen Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) has fallen out with her brother, and enlists Caesar's support with the help of her considerable charms. The birth of a son creates new problems for Rome, and anxiety for Caesar's enemies and allies alike, the latter faction led by loyal soldier Marc Antony (Richard Burton).""Cleopatra"" was supposed to be two three-hour movies, one devoted to Caesar and Cleopatra, the other to Antony and Cleopatra. It's ground well covered, most memorably in separate plays by George Bernard Shaw and Shakespeare, though the film doesn't list them as influences. Twentieth-Century Fox balked at director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's idea for separate movies, and the result forced Mankiewicz to trim six hours of material into one four-hour roadshow.This was a recipe for disaster. Oddly, the part of the film that suffered more, the Caesar half, comes off best. Harrison was always golden playing Shaw roles, and his Caesar is a magnificent Machiavel, dashing off crisp one-liners as he makes the acquaintance of Cleo & Co.""Trust,"" he muses. ""The word has always made me apprehensive. Like wine, whenever I have tried it, the aftereffects have not been good.""Later, in a tender moment with Cleopatra, contemplating global conquest, he tells her: ""I am 52. My remaining ambition is to keep the world from conquering me.""But as even the most casual student of history knows, Caesar's not around for the whole film. The rest of the time, we get Taylor and Burton in what amounted to Act 1 of filmdom's famous pairing, and neither turns out well here. Their story gets too turgid, with Taylor flashing her eyes too much while Burton screams and pouts. His Mark Antony also drinks too much, as if the producers were making some point about the actor's future downfall.By the end of the film, the actors recite some terrible lines that strain at a significance ""Cleopatra"" doesn't quite earn.Him: ""You and I will prove death so much less than love.""Her: ""There has never been such a silence.""There are good moments in the second half, too, but not nearly as many. One nice moment occurs when Mark Antony has to go to Cleopatra for assistance after he has married another woman for political reasons, and she tells him to pound some desert in a way that brings out the comic abilities of both actors. Taylor and Burton did better work this way, as sly comics rather than overblown lovers. But overall, there's just too much ham on display.The scenery is still magnificent. Alas the film does much less as it goes on to distract us from it. Many scenes involve smoke being churned up, unintended metaphor that. A climax at the Battle of Actium is strangely undernourished with a few ships and a lot more smoke, followed by a long wrap-up where Antony whines and Cleopatra sighs more than is really necessary.A lot of ""Cleopatra"" feels unnecessary, and what is necessary is often short-changed, like how Caesar gets out of Alexandria alive or why Mark Antony makes such a hash of his post-Cleopatra life. Defenders say the true greatness of ""Cleopatra"" may lie in a director's cut that remains buried in the vaults. They may be right, but watching this four-hour extravaganza didn't leave me wanting more.",Cleopatra

It is unjustly maligned occasionally, but time will prove this film to be what it genuinely is: awesome and fascinating. It was hugely popular when it was released too, something also overlooked and would easily be one of the top grossing films before The Sound Of Music and of the 60s. Fox should be encouraged to cinema release this again as a 6 hour event..if there are any cinemas left outside a shopping mall that could show it.

However, the movie did get made and is not nearly as bad as the critics would have you believe. First of all, Liz is beautiful and never got much credit for her acting, but she delivers in the title role.  Burton is her lover and their off-screen affair obviously fueled their love scenes. The best acting is by Rex Harrison, by far, and he got the only Oscar nomination out of the actors.  Several other familiar faces are seen, including Carroll O'Connor, Roddy McDowall and Martin Landau.
I saw this with a woman I used to know, and a bottle of Scotch, on a rainy weeknight at a NYC theatre that used to show old movies.  The ideal circumstances for an epic that really should be seen on a big screen.

52,Steffi_P,"""Mixing politics and passion""",7,17 June 2010,"By the early 60s, the heyday of the giant ancient-world epic had just about passed – not because they were becoming less popular, but because cinema was becoming more introspective, not to mention less conservative, and a new generation was looking for other ways to ply the trade. But there were still enough old-fashioned (and to be honest, far more savvy) bods around to know that stars plus spectacles equalled bums on seats and fat receipts.Nevertheless Hollywood was by now a very different place, and the previously unusual move was made of leaving much of the production of Cleopatra in the hands of one man – writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Now Mankiewicz was certainly proficient at his job, but his focus was always very intimate, with humungous epics conspicuously absent from his CV . It appears he was shoved on board as a level-headed professional who could bring some order to proceedings. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just means he crafted a vision of an epic that was somewhat different to that of the studio heads. This is not a sword-and-sandal spectacular, nor is it even a sweeping character study like Lawrence of Arabia. Rather it is an intense romantic melodrama, in the line of the A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, concerning human interaction above all other things.Mankiewicz eschewed action scenes – not because he was a pacifist, but I think more because he felt them a distraction from the nobility of drama. Of course, the crowds of extras and the stupendous sets are all there, but they are quite literally backdrops. Not that Mankiewicz's sharp eye ignores them. His style was in fact all about backgrounds, in particular using background movement (or lack of it) to highlight what was going on in the foreground. In the opening scene we have hundreds of soldiers milling round, while others stand imperiously still. Which of the two Mankiewicz allows us to see at any given point helps define the importance of the moment or the character, and this is how the hordes of extras are used in all the big outdoor scenes. On other occasions he uses the cavernous halls and magnificent frescoes to evoke tones of mystery, emptiness, austerity and so forth. It's rare that he shows any of this splendour for its own sake. Forget Citizen Kane – this is probably the most outrageous example of a director's personal indulgence at a studio's expense.It is so like Mankiewicz to turn every asset he has to focus us upon the actors and their performances, and yet it is the acting itself in Cleopatra that has most often been singled out for critical drubbing. Elizabeth Taylor does not make a bad Queen of Egypt. She does however appear a little worse the wear, probably from her recent illness and the rigours of such a massive production of which she is in almost every scene. As a result she seems a little flat and lacking in conviction. Rex Harrison on the other hand breezes effortlessly through his part, and wins us over with his honest charm, even managing to bring out a touching tenderness when instructing his young son in the ways of despotism. The virile and stocky Richard Burton certainly has the perfect physique for Mark Anthony, and while he does a decent bit of grand theatricality, he is actually far better in meek and sensitive roles such as those in Becket and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The most applause should really go to Roddy McDowell, who relishes playing the only really manic character, and yet does so without making an extravagant mess of it.At the end of the day though this was still an old style epic production with a very professional ""big picture"" production crew, and it is their work which looms largest. The colossal reconstructions of ancient Egypt and Rome seem utterly real and boundless in their sprawl. The cinematography of Leon Shamroy (the de facto expert for this kind of picture) creates an exquisitely precise variation of warm yellows and cool blues. The editing by Dorothy Spencer is top-notch too – look at how craftily it times the ladles coming in from left and right in the first Pamela Brown soothsaying scene.Cleopatra ended up being one of those awkward pictures that was a commercial hit but a massive critical failure, and even its box office success was not enough to recoup its mammoth budget. One way or another it spelled out to the studios that they would no longer be able to do things as they had in the 50s. It was not the last of the ancient world epics, nor even the last decent one (check out the sublime The Bible In the Beginning, made in 1966), but it is probably the last one that a studio had high hopes for and poured its all into.",Cleopatra

My final score is 9 out of 10 because this film is epic but has flaws.",Cleopatra
54,Spleen,I think I know why it flopped.,7,27 December 1999,"Well, the REAL reason is that it cost about $270 million of today's dollars, an amount almost impossible to recoup.  ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" was a popular success, but it, too, would have been considered a disaster if it had cost as much as ""Cleopatra"" had.  But ""Cleopatra"" didn't merely lose money.  It became unloved and unmourned.  Here's why.The successful -- or at least, the popular -- ancient world epics all combine two things: perilous situations where the fate of nations hangs in the balance, and a central story involving at least one common man. Cleopatra combines the fate of nation hanging in the balance with a story about RULERS.  Thee's not a common man in sight, unless you count Marc Antony, who doesn't appear until just before the intermission, and he isn't a common man, in any case.  I don't think this is necessarly a flaw.  But I think it IS why ""Cleopatra"" is so unloved.The other reason, and this IS a flaw, is that Cleopatra the woman is so completely unlovable.  Julius Caesar is at worst a charismatic tyrant, much easier to sympathise with than Cleopatra, who shouts constantly, is enigmatic to the point of not having any personality at all, and changes her mind not only from scene to scene, but from sentence to sentence.  The scene to scene changes are the worst.  I got the uncomfortable feeling that successive scenes were written by different people, who never bothered to compare notes.And Cleopatra's costumes!  Really!  I had more than one reason to be glad when Elizabeth Taylor removed her clothes.  The men's and and the women's costumes were credited to different people; I would have creidted them to different galaxies, the women's costumes belonging on ""Star Trek"".  Some of the outfits on the dancing girls were at least racy.Oh, yes: before I forget to state the obvious, Cleopatra was never really the main character, and the story didn't go anywhere.HOWEVER, you couldn't spend the equivalent of $270 million in 1963 without getting something in return.  No doubt you could today, but the technology didn't exist then.  The spectacle IS spectacle, and the boats, and indeed all waterside scenes, are jaw-droppingly good.  Why do people object to 20th Century Fox spending so much money to give us such sights?  The money doesn't come out of OUR purse.  The dialogue ain't so bad, the musical score is Alex North's best (inappropriate in places, but speaking as someone who doesn't really like North's music, it was still lovely), and even the anachronistic and trashy sets are better to look at than many things from the 1960s.Two names leapt out at me from the opening credits.  The fist was ""Jacqui Chan"", which I found amusing, in a small way.  The second was ""Richard O'Sullivan"".  That's right: Ptolemy is played by the lead actor from ""Man About the House"" and other British sitcoms which I suspect that nobody a day younger than me can remember.  They were big in their day, though.",Cleopatra
55,EdgarST,Cleopatra,9,13 May 2006,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz laughed the last. His goal a diptych to be released separately, rich in Shakespearean's tragic force, ample in scope, but intimate in tone- was betrayed by 20th Century Fox's chairman Darryl F. Zanuck, who butchered it into a four-hour film. In spite of all the troubles surrounding its production, ""Cleopatra"" defined big cinematic spectacle for me: I was 12 years old and saw it on a Cinerama screen. It was huge, and it was grandiose. Elizabeth Taylor carried the movie on her back, but she had not developed into a full dramatic actress yet; and Leon Shamroy's Oscar-winning cinematography ranged from dramatic lighting to flourishes of color that resemble the light show of a cabaret in La Habana. But the story was compelling, and everybody gave their best. It also became the entrepreneurial model for pre-selling movies before the cameras rolled. It did not have very good reviews, and 1960's yellow press, which had nothing to do with Mankiewicz's reflection of power and love, tarnished its values. By the 1980s a tendency to reevaluate the movie had grown, and moreover it became an icon of the big historical Hollywood spectacle. Not a masterpiece by scholars' standards, it is nevertheless the big opus in the career of Mankiewicz, maker of ""All About Eve.""",Cleopatra

Anyhow, I was. TCM offered this four hour turkey in its showcase about ""Making Faces"" and the history of Cleopatra over the years, first as-performed by Claudette Colbert who was much more vamp-ish and at least could make the anachronisms of her very 1930-ish wardrobe seem convincing, then as this travesty of a film, at the cusp of what would become ""The Liz and Dick Show.""Didn't Joseph Mankiewicz even bother to check the two Shakespeare plays (""Julius Caesar"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra"") which narrate the stories presented here? Or was he too enamored of his own capacity for dialog that he thought, ""Sure. Let me make 'em talk until the celluloid melts; it's my dialog and they'll love it."" Not so, Mr. Mankiewicz -- what worked so well in ALL ABOUT EVE tanks here. And for a film this excruciating and long, made even longer by its lack of action, it's a killer. It made me wish to do myself in, especially in a painful way. But I hung on for dear life: I've seen worse, so this wasn't that bad. Just bad enough to make me feel like the one responsible for being under that massive caravan in CleoLizzie's entrance to Rome. Only I'd tip it over.I blame Mankewicz for the accelerated aging I've suffered as a result of having sat through CLEOPATRA. It's his fault my hangover was as big as Texas and then some the morning after. It's his fault that every time I see Liz I feel compelled to retch and double-over, and I consider her a darn good actress.

59,tomsview,All About Cleo,7,13 September 2017,"When I walked into Sydney's Mayfair Theatre in 1964 to see ""Cleopatra"", I passed beneath a huge mural that adorned the outside of the theatre above the awning. It was painted by my father. At the time it was thought to be the largest mural in Australia. Other artists were commissioned to do similar ones in New York, Los Angeles and London.Dad's painting was based on American artist Howard Terpning's illustration of Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison. It was so big it was painted in sections using the backdrop machinery of Sydney's old Tivoli Theatre. Although my father worked for his normal weekly wage with a display company, the eventual cost would have been part of that unbelievable $42 million ($340 million in today's money), which was spent on the movie.But what a movie, even with its flaws it's still huge. There are simply no small scenes. Back in the day we were used to major sword and sandals epics: ""Land of the Pharaohs"", ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"", however for sheer size, ""Cleo"" topped them all. Even Mithridates' army, which was on screen for 30 seconds, had hundreds of extras costumed down to the last stud on their metal wrist guards.Of course the spectacle had to play second fiddle to the Liz and Dick show. There was so much hype around the film, it was hard to sit back and just buy into the era like you could with other films.Today, a lot of that baggage has gone and it can be viewed more dispassionately, although it's still amusing to catch Liz giving a glimpse of bare thigh and bum cheek as she reclines on her chaise longue. Not to be outdone, Richard Burton's tunics seem way too short. Even now they don't exactly melt into the roles of Cleopatra and Marc Antony; Rex Harrison is more successful as Big Julie.Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script sounds very B.C. up until the moment Liz rolls out of the carpet, and then the whole thing gets more all over the place. When Cleopatra says to Caesar, ""I've rubbed you the wrong way"", we guess the ancient texts weren't consulted too closely.It's a long film, but you can see where the money went. Cleopatra's entry into Rome and the Battle of Actium would be hard to beat even with the magic of today's special effects. And the music. They got the best. Composer Alex North had excelled himself with the score to ""Spartacus"" and he came up with another stunning, exotic soundscape for this one. Over the years I have seen ""Cleopatra"" a number of times, and it passes the true test of a film for me, I can always watch it again and still enjoy it.",Cleopatra

61,jacobs-greenwood,"Two films for the price of one, the first half is vastly superior to the second",6,6 December 2016,"Really two films in one, the first being vastly superior to the second, more famous half. Before the intermission, the initial two hours of this historical drama focuses on Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and his relationship with the titled Queen of Egypt (Elizabeth Taylor). The tempestuous (love affair and) relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony (Richard Burton), though it may have been fascinating to audiences of the time given the off-screen affair between these stars, is much less compelling, even boring, making the overall film only slightly above average despite its limitless budget which helped it earn four Oscars: Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design, and Special Effects.Only Harrison's acting was Oscar nominated, and rightfully so, as his is easily the best performance in the film, which was also nominated for Best Picture, Editing, Sound, and substantially original Musical Score. Harrison was to win the Best Actor Oscar playing Henry Higgins (in his next film, My Fair Lady (1964)), a character whose attitude towards women was not unlike Caesar's.Another noteworthy performance was given by Roddy McDowall, as Caesar's heir Octavian, in the film's second half, the best scene of which is his dressing down by Cleopatra near its end.Directed and co-written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this 4+ hour version also boasts a cast which includes Hume Cronyn and Martin Landau, among others. If not for the director's (or editor's?) proclivity for showing every lead character's prolonged entrance and exit (to showcase the expensive sets?), the film could easily run nearer to 3 hours, as one released version does.",Cleopatra
62,MartianOctocretr5,Bloated film that seems longer than Cleo's 19-year reign,5,26 June 2008,"The movie has moments, but its long-winded running time is longer than the Nile River. The movie's obvious attempt to emulate other grand scale biblical epics, with a narrative that does not support this approach, results in over-indulgence. Lavish sets, over-paid actors, numerous extras, etc. are unfortunately mired in poor scripting and pacing. The direction is sloppy at some points. The biography of the real Cleopatra was intriguing and could have made for prime source material for a movie, but this drama, while getting in many significant events, is uneven at depicting them effectively. The story is burdened with plodding, irrelevant scenes that could easily have been scrapped. Many times the sets look like 20th Century homes with plastic furniture and modern tiling that has been waxed with Lemon Pledge. Such fakery is inexcusable in such a high-budget. It's in several of these scenes where Liz Taylor (as Cleo) and Richard Burton (her real life boyfriend playing Marc Anthony) just do a series of childish arguing/shouting matches: after a while they're pretty generic. Both actors are capable of more than the Drama 101 level of skill you see here, and you'll be hoping the asps make their appearance soon. Scenes with Taylor and Rex Harrison (as Caesar) in the earlier part of the film are somewhat better. As the movie drags on, it's almost as if she got tired of playing the role, and was ready for the asps, too. At times, she wails and screeches like she's trying out for a ""Gidget Goes to the Beach"" walk-on part.Aspired to far more than was necessary to tell the story. The result is an uneven production, which meanders between highly dramatic moments and snail's pace talk-a-thon interludes. Watchable, but not brilliant.

63,sme_no_densetsu,Not as bad as its reputation suggests,7,10 August 2008,"""Cleopatra"" is generally known as one of the biggest bombs in Hollywood history. However, the truth is that the film eventually managed to turn a profit and also garnered four Oscars on nine nominations. Hardly what I would call a bomb, though the film is far from perfect.Over the course of four hours (!) we follow the exploits of Queen Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) as she sets her sights on ruling not just Egypt, but the entire civilized world. First she attempts to ride the coattails of Rex Harrison's Julius Caesar and later she attempts much the same approach with Richard Burton's younger Mark Antony.As the four hour running time should indicate, this is a film of epic scope, yet much of the 'action' occurs in conversation as the characters lock horns over various matters. Perhaps this is one area in which the film falters. These four hours could have used a little more spectacle (a la Cleopatra's entrance into Rome) and a little less verbal confrontation. Nevertheless, the storyline is fairly interesting, though exhausting.The acting performances are acceptable with Harrison, Burton & Roddy McDowall being particularly notable. The weakness on this front is Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra. While I don't think that she's really that bad there must have been more suitable choices available. Her weaknesses are particularly highlighted in the scenes that she shares with the aforementioned actors.Technically, though, the film is quite impressive. Unsurprisingly, the four Oscars won were all in technical categories. Certainly, the sets and costumes look as if no expense was spared. Mankiewicz's direction is solid and the editing & cinematography are top notch. The score, by 15-time Oscar nominee Alex North, is memorable as well.All things considered, I think that ""Cleopatra"" is worth a look if you enjoy epic films. It's no masterpiece but it's interesting to contemplate what might have been if the film had a less troubled production.",Cleopatra
64,Maciste_Brother,A big bloated corpse,3,26 June 2008,"When CLEOPATRA was released, it was the highest grossing film of the year and yet the movie almost ruined 20th Century Fox because the movie cost so much that its ""success"" could barely cover the cost of production. Hence the reason CLEOPATRA is regarded as being one of the biggest box office flops in cinematic history and there's a good reason for that ""undeserved"" rep: the movie itself is the most monumentally ill-conceived project in history. The only thing going for it is its bloat. Yes, that's its main quality. Aside from the eye filling production values, everything else is wrong: the script pretends to be detailed events of Cleopatra's life but in actually, it mercilessly skims over her life in the most uninvolving way. In the end, the film is more interested in telling the story of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony than of the famous Egyptian Queen; because the dire script was D.O.A, the rest could have salvaged it on a certain level but every single actor, except for Richard Burton (who actually looks healthy here and not the alcoholic Burton), is hopelessly miscast. Rex Harrison, Hume Cronyn, Martin Landau, Roddy McDowall, Carroll O'Connor (yes, Archie Bunker himself) are cast either as Romans or Egyptians of sorts even though none of them look remotely Roman or Egyptian. Many make fun of underrated Italian Sword & Sandal films but the one thing that can be said about them is how the actors in those films were at least Mediterranean looking. Landau, McDowall, Cronyn and certainly Carroll O'Connor all stood out like sore thumbs. No amount of kitschy Ancient sets could hide that glaring fact.But those are secondary actors playing secondary roles. The film really suffers badly because Rex Harrison, as Julius Caesar, and Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra were truly miscast. Elizabeth Taylor is completely lost in the gargantuan production, only her breasts and the ridiculous number of custom changes make her stand out from the all-engulfing monster of a movie. The actress simply didn't inhabit her role at any level except on a superficial visual manner. Taylor looks like she's playing ""Cleopatra Egyptian Barbie Set"" than a serious actress trying to add depth to a legendary historical character. But the biggest casting error is certainly Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar. Harrison plays the Roman Emperor like your average English School Principle, yammering on inane dialogue which belies the grandeur, strength and charisma needed to play Caesar. When Caesar is killed (this is not a spoiler) by his fellow Senators, the scene looks absolutely ridiculous because, aside from asking too much power, Harrison's ""softy"" portrayal of Caesar could hardly elicit such a brutal and violent end to his life. Things are made worse during that scene as we watch Cleopatra ""witnessing"" the murder thanks to her High Priestess' magic, Taylor moaning in an apoplectic way as Caesar is about to be killed. I never laughed so much.One of the film's most unpleasant aspects is seeing Rex Harrison getting it on with Elizabeth Taylor. A truly unsexy sex scene if there ever was one. We hardly see Taylor as a pregnant Cleopatra and when she does deliver the baby, in the next scene she's already sporting an hour-glass figure, wearing a tight dress showcasing her narrow waistline. Again, I never laughed so much. Couldn't they just have waited a few more scenes before shoving Taylor in another ghastly bosom revealing dress? Like I said before, the only thing going for it is the production values. Some of it is truly grand and some of it is simply grand Kitsch with a capital K, certainly Cleopatra's arrival by boat. I mean, come on. But all of this excess amounts to nothing if the characters are more wooden and cardboard than the actual sets themselves. The entire moment when Cleopatra arrives in Rome with her son is long and detailed. It's over-the-top, for sure but I wish they had spent more time coming up with a carefully constructed script with unforgettable characters or portrayals than all that glitz. When the ""Cleopatra's Arrival in Rome"" show is finally over, it's only a few minutes after that that Caesar is killed. After going though all that trouble of mounting such and elaborate and expensive but alas empty scene, when the death of Caesar occurs, I really wondered why they bothered coming up with that time wasting scene only to kill Caesar a few minutes afterwards in the silliest possible way. His death should have been pivotal. Instead we have this big bloated corpse of a movie.",Cleopatra
65,inspectors71,Eight Hours of My Life,6,21 October 2016,"For some strange reason, I have watched Joseph L. Mankiewicz' Cleopatra (1963) twice. That's 8 hours out of, at present time, about 450k.If you're picking up an unimpressed vibe, well . . . This elephantine mess of a historical epic cum romance is impressive only if the viewer simply marvels at the eye-popping scope of the story of the pairings of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra and Marcuus Antonius and said same Egyptian queen. Mankiewicz creates the Eastern Mediterranean and Imperial Rome, 2,000 years ago, and the viewer has to marvel at the skill of the art directors before CGI. But, with the 1962 amount of about a bajillion dollars spent (100 bajillion now?), you'd hope for something more than a shrill and tedious star vehicle wherein Richard Burton, Roddy McDowall, and, of course, the coarse Elizabeth Taylor chew up the scenery as fast as the set builders can replace it.Burton looks desperate for some real alcohol in one of those Jacuzzi-sized chalices you see in costume dramas, McDowall simpers and swishes as a very femmie/bitchy Octavian, and Rex Harrison, the only reason to watch, even though he dies before the two-hour mark, makes Caesar something the others aren't, a real man. Real, as in, believable.It's Taylor who makes you stop the Netflix playback to see just how much time is left on this awful thing. Under ginormous eyelashes and head dresses, almost baring a butt cheek here and a breast there, and shrieking and clawing with her voice alone, Liz makes you think of what Peggy Noonan says Hillary Clinton sounds like--your landlady yelling down the stairs to remind you to clean up after your dog.Taylor, the ""most beautiful woman in the world,"" is a thoroughly unsympathetic character. What kills Cleopatra isn't a broken heart, a loss of her throne, or a snake in her fruit cup, it's that we simply don't care about her, or for that matter, anyone, besides good ol' Rex.And with that said, I'll bring this back to the lost 8 hours in 2 viewings--once in the 80s and once this last week. When I first saw Cleopatra, I rented it in VHS form from my local video rental shop. It was full screen. If you don't understand the difference between full screen and wide screen, just think of it this way. Full screen on an old TV has a visual ratio of 1.33 to 1, the view from side to side is 1/3 greater than the height of the picture. Wide screen-- or letterbox--mimics human sight, including peripheral vision. It's about 2.35 to 1. Get it? Wide screen?When you watch a wide screen movie in full screen, you lose about 40% of the picture the movie maker wanted you to see. It's a major irritant to annoying purists like me. I want to see the whole thing.Because Cleopatra is in some sort of super-d-duper wide screen, I felt ripped off watching the squished version, even with good scan and pan (the editor who transfers the film to a full screen format scans the image for important action and dialogue, then pans over to capture it).Another purist toothache.I wanted to see all of Burton's blustering and pounding his shield, McDowall swishing and shirking, and Taylor flapping those eyelashes and almost having a soapy boob pop out of the bathwater.I wanted to see the whole tit and kaboodle.Unfortunately, the wide screen version didn't add anything. I just sat there wondering why I didn't see a custodian pushing a Swiffer around some polished Egyptian floor waaaay off on the left.I should have known better. I should have stuck with the VHS version.I should have settled for 60% of the kaboodle.",Cleopatra
66,bobsgrock,A grand and glorious epic for the ages.,8,1 September 2008,"It may have been outrageously priced and taken way too long to film combined with too much heartache for one man, but Joseph L. Mankiewicz did it by completing this breathtaking epic, which is one not to be forgotten. Elizabeth Taylor beautifully portrays the passionate queen who is willing to do anything to hold onto her throne as ruler of Egypt and avoid being swept up by the mighty and imperial Roman Empire. Her first order of business is to seduce the face of that empire, Julius Caeasr, played with dignity and grace by the great Rex Harrison. Soon, she has a son, one whom she thinks will be the next ruler of Egypt and Rome as one.The story moves on with Caesar being murdered in the Senate, Cleopatra fleeing to Alexandria, seducing Marc Antony, the new face of Rome, and finally facing her demise in Octavian, Caesar's nephew and successor. If you are a history buff as I am, you will certainly appreciate this fine-looking piece of history that is for the most part historically accurate. The sets are extraordinary to look at along with the costumes, extras, etc. It is quite obvious where $44 million of 1963 dollars went. Because of this fact, many people feel this movie is overrated and bloated out of proportion. I say all that expense was needed to tell this story correctly. The facts are larger than life, thus the movie should be as well. The acting is solid with Taylor being a Cleopatra you can't look away from, Burton giving us a Shakespeare-like portrayal of Antony and Harrison gracefully portraying Julius Caesar. The first half is slow and seems tedious and useless, but give it time. The second half flows much better as we get into the juice of the story and the real motives behind it all. It all adds up to one of the most satisfying pictures I have ever seen. It is a grand and glorious steak in a world where most movies are simply ground chuck.",Cleopatra
67,dglink,A Lavish Intimate Spectacle of Political Intrigue and Ambition,10,7 August 2012,"Enveloped by legend, myth, and derision, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's epic ""Cleopatra"" deserves to be seen and re-evaluated minus the publicity baggage long attached to the production. Whatever Elizabeth Taylor may have felt about ""Cleopatra,"" the film provided her signature role. The most famous actress of her time in the role of the most famous woman of her time is serendipity. The most famous romance of the 20th century between two movie stars portraying the most famous lovers of the first century BC is the stuff of tabloid legends.Despite drastic cutting from a six-hour two-film concept to a roadshow version of 246 minutes, what remains on screen has aged like a fine vintage. ""Cleopatra"" is not a sword and sandals epic with wooden acting, laughable dialog, and muscle-bound stars. Instead, the film is an intimate, yet complex, tale of power, ambition, and political intrigue, more Shakespeare and Shaw, than Steve Reeves and Victor Mature. The script, labored over by Oscar-winning director-writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is literate, often witty, and evidently relished by the performers, especially Rex Harrison and Roddy McDowall. Elizabeth Taylor ably matches Harrison as Julius Caesar in their verbal sparring during the first half, while she and Richard Burton are more than acting the parts of Anthony and Cleopatra during the romantic scenes in the second part. Although many supporting players were reduced to cameos by the drastic studio cutting, besides McDowall as Octavian, Caesar Danova, Hume Cronin, and Martin Landau hold their own with the leading trio.""Cleopatra"" has the physical aura of an ancient fantasy, the sets and costumes are dazzling, and the recent Blu-ray release showcases John DeCuir's art direction, Irene Sharaff's costumes, and Leon Shamroy's cinematography to their best advantage since the original June 1963 release. Although the sets are too brightly lit, too spotlessly clean, too unused and unworn, and too elegantly designed to look period accurate, the Alexandria and Rome palaces are glittering showplaces, worthy of an exotic resort. The golden barge that carries Cleopatra to Tarsus and the enormous sphinx that brings her and Caesarion into Rome are jaw-dropping. While Cleopatra's entry into Rome is as spectacular as any scene in film history, Mankiewicz offers less spectacle of the ""cast of thousands"" variety than expected. There is no chariot race, and the sea battle of Actium will not get pulses racing. ""Cleopatra"" is character and dialog driven, which may not appeal to everyone. Action fans will consider the pacing slow, and, occasionally, plot gaps appear where footage is missing.Alex North's score complements and comments beautifully throughout, and the fade-in fade-out transitions to and from weathered frescoes deserved a special Oscar. The scandals whose repercussions reached the Vatican and the U.S. Congress, the mismanagement and cost over runs that nearly toppled a studio, the critical reviews that ranged from raves to pans, all should be relegated to movie history and the excellent documentary ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood."" The epic film that emerged from chaos may not be the masterpiece that Mankiewicz conceived, but ""Cleopatra"" is far more than detractors say.

The original plan was to watch finish the film the next day, because the film became so slow' that I couldn't take it for almost 4 hours in a row, but when I shelved Cleopatra after about 2 hours, I found it to be impossible to motivate myself to watch yet another 2 hours of film on Cleopatra. It is not that this film is incredibly bad, but that it is just not good enough to spend almost 4 hours on. It is just to long. A film of this quality should not extend 2 hours, maybe 2 hours 30, but 4 hours? I cannot motivate myself to do that. Sure the sets are impressive, the acting is OK, but it is just too long and not compelling enough. Try it if you want, but if you're already bored with the first hour I recommend you do not start the second one.5,5 out of 10",Cleopatra

Although beautifully filmed and with a great soundtrack, I found it very boring, dull, and dreadful. It was like seeing ''Doctor Zhivago'' after 10 hours of stock fottage of the Russian revolution was added. The opening credits lasted 10 minutes while they could have lasted only 5 minutes. Yet many films are very long but still entertaining and engaging to watch (like ''The Longest Day'', ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', ''The Young Lions''), but this should have lasted at least two hours. I felt asleep the first time I watched it, and the second time I left it after 2 hours! And when I leave a movie even after the second viewing it's a bad sign. Many scenes (like the parade scene) seemed to last an eternity, and the acting was very wooden.Now don't assume I don't like old American movies. I liked and loved many of them, just not this one.",Cleopatra

Despite having rather unrealistic and drying scenes, it's a pretty good movie. Highly recommend.",Cleopatra
71,Igenlode Wordsmith,Whatever did she see in Mark Antony?,8,9 December 2007,"After all the hype, the four-hour version of this film was actually very much better than I had expected -- and more intelligent. I'd been given to understand that this was an exercise in spectacle, bad taste and overspending; nobody ever thought to mention, for one thing, that it was actually *funny*.Not in a bad way, either. We don't laugh at the acting: we laugh at the sharp repartee, the sly visual digs (Cleopatra's rump rolling into view as Caesar urbanely remarks that one has to see the back-side of any piece of merchandise to judge its true merit), and at Cleopatra's artful manipulation of all the men in her life, down to the Roman soldiers, sent to march her off, whom she assures sweetly that they need not be afraid of the dark if she accompanies them. This is not the sort of thing one expects from an Epic; these are the qualities of a far more intimate drama, and other, more recent, blockbusters would have done well to mark the effect.On the other hand, the film really is as spectacular as promised, with the sort of eye-opening luxury that can only be afforded by pictures of an era where there could be no possibility of computer enhancement. The budget is all on screen, and it largely pays off: the only scenes that really do look fake are some of the sea-battle shots. The spectacle of Cleopatra's entrance into Rome really is jaw-dropping as it just cranks up and up -- when you think you've seen everything it comes up with yet another surprise, right down to the ebony statues that turn out to be alive. There are a few very 'Sixties' shots later in the film of Elizabeth Taylor with hairstyles looking like Elizabeth Taylor rather than like a daughter of the Ptolemies, but otherwise her appearance is an absolute knock-out. Other people have commented on her 'shrill', 'thin' voice; I couldn't hear that at all.The main trouble I had with ""Cleopatra"" was Mark Antony. As seen on screen (there are rumours that more flattering scenes showing the character's initial achievements after Caesar's death were among the first material to be cut), the character is an unshaven, bibulous, self-pitying heap, a loser more or less from the start (in his first scenes in the second act, he is already drinking heavily), and it is not at all clear why Cleopatra, a shrewd political operator, would want to have anything to do with him, much less fall in love with him more or less overnight, still less gamble her vast possessions on backing him against Octavian: the reviewer who described the character as less a tragic fallen hero than one who 'starts at the bottom and topples sideways' hits the nail cruelly on the head. The love affair one simply has to take more or less as read, on the grounds that the plot requires it. Burton and Tayor may have been passionately involved: Antony and Cleopatra are less than convincing, and I'm not sure if it's the fault of the actors, the script, or the scenario.Despite the age difference, Cleopatra's scenes with Julius Caesar are much better from this point of view. Where the doomed-lovers tragedy struggles somewhat, the earlier liaison is played out almost along romantic comedy lines -- it's hard not to find oneself applauding for the spirited young Queen all the way as she bargains and smart-talks her way into power, bidding what is initially a very thin hand up into the sole rulership of Egypt -- but we also get to see Caesar's tactical brilliance, both in military and political matters, and the duelling couple are ultimately well matched. My only problem with Rex Harrison's otherwise admirable depiction of the character was the unfortunately close resemblance achieved by Sid James in ""Carry on Cleo""; a wonderful send-up (making ingenious use of the abandoned sets from ""Cleopatra""), but a slightly distracting one in this context! Martin Landau stands out, as always, as the honourable and somewhat harassed Rufio, dealing intelligently and diplomatically with the whims of his superiors, and loyal unto death. Roddy McDowall is weak and yet sinister as a blond Octavian, initially inconsequential and ultimately all-consuming; he is a consummate politician, not a military commander, and it is easy to sympathise with the characters who would prefer death to falling captive into his hands. I found Robert Stephens notable in the small part of Germanicus, Antony's man in Rome, and Cesare Danova as Cleopatra's servant Apollodorus.Despite its four-hour running length, the film never seemed too long. This is no ""Heaven's Gate"", and it's no ""Lord of the Rings"" either; character is rarely allowed to be subordinate to spectacle, never mind special effects, and the dialogue is surprisingly good. I don't know how well it would come across on TV (frankly, it's hard to imagine, given the sheer scale of some of the shots), and, like ""Gone With the Wind"", the first half is better than the second. I'd vote the first at 8, the second maybe only a 7 -- but as a whole it was undoubtedly worth paying to see.",Cleopatra
72,perfectbond,Difficult to evaluate,7,22 January 2004,"It is extremely difficult to evaluate this film. On the one hand, the presentation is first class: the sets, props, costumes, location photography, and music are all of the caliber befitting the grandiose ambition of the production. I personally found the acting by the truly all-star cast to be uniformly excellent throughout with McDowall's Octavian and Harrison's Caesar deserving special mention. Taylor deserved the million dollars she got for the title role and Burton's occasional scenery chewing didn't detract significantly from his interpretation of Mark Antony. But the question remains over what might have been. I believe any true film buff would want to pass final judgment on this production only after having viewed the 6 hour plus version in order to determine whether the extensive cuts (even in the new 2 DVD four hour version) were justified. I should add that the third disc of extras contributes greatly to the appreciation (especially where the director controversy and Burton-Taylor relationship is concerned) of what was attempted.",Cleopatra
73,elvircorhodzic,"""There are never enough hours in the days of a queen, and her nights have too many.""",6,7 July 2017,"CLEOPATRA is an epic historical drama as a kind of group of non-complementary film segments, which are building an attractive epic story. The plot follows the eighteen tumultuous years that led to the founding of the Roman Empire. Cleopatra seduces Julius Caesar in order to forge an alliance with Rome so that she may hold on to her Egyptian empire. However, her plans crumble when Caesar is stabbed to death in the Roman Senate. Cleopatra is left without an ally, and Egypt is up for grabs. However, she seduces the Roman general Mark Antony in order to make him over into her new protector, but, a powerful general becomes dissolute drunk under her influence. He is defeated in a decisive battle, then the fate of Egypt, Cleopatra and his life come into danger...Film runs a few minutes more than four hours, excluding the intermission. It is difficult to follow, especially if there is no cohesion between the constant conflicts, political intrigue and erotic romance. Of course, some will say that this is an adventurous tragedy of historical dimensions. I think, this film constantly loses its point, realism, motives and passions and becomes a vulgar soap opera of epic proportions.The costumes are superbly designed. The scenery is very poor. Soundtrack is impermanent, despite epic overtones. Characters are not developed to the end, despite the duration of this film. Mr. Mankiewicz is focused on a visual excitement to the detriment of the direction and melodrama. Well, Cleopatra's entrance into Rome is truly spectacular, but an epilogue is too theatrical.Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra is one of the most erotic phenomena in the history of cinema. However, I think that it was not the ultimate goal. She is a strong and capable woman, who is poisoned by her own ambition to rule the world or maybe just a few powerful men. The arrogance and pride in her character are truly impressive. However, her performance is nothing special.Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar is a wise and generous ruler, who fell in love with a clever woman. He is torn between his duty, ambitions and desires. When the ruler loses his head .... we all know what's coming .... Mr. Harrison has offered a good performance.Richard Burton as Mark Antony is an exciting, emotional and arrogant general or lover. His character, in addition to a lack of self-confidence, corresponds to the character of Cleopatra. However, he can not follow her ambitions.This is a sumptuous, attractive and, unfortunately, boring experience.",Cleopatra
74,jdkraus,"Great in the first two hours, but a disappointment for the rest",6,19 April 2008,"In the 1960s, Cleopatra was known as the biggest budget movie ever made. It was originally set at a $2 million budget, but ending up at $44 million. With such a high budget film, it makes me wonder how it could be a flop in the box office. After now seeing it, I can marvel at its grandeur of the magnificent costumes, sets/art direction, visual effects, countless extras, and amazing visual effects (especially for such an old movie). But what it lacks is the main components that make an epic film: a solid story and great performances.There was much that happened in Cleopatra's life, and trying to cover it within three hours is almost impossible. I didn't see the 192-minute version, but the 248-minute version. Even this cut was missing some plots. The film pretty much is broken into almost two separate stories. The first part is about the relationship between Cleopatra and Julius Caesar. It was interesting to watch as their love for each other bloomed and the power struggles it took for Caesar to get Cleopatra's power back over Egypt from her brother.After the inevitable death of Caesar, the rest of the movie is pretty much the love/hate relationship between Cleopatra and her new lover Marc Antony. This is when the film becomes a complete bore-fest of nothing more than Richard Burton pouring out his feelings to Elizabeth Taylor, and her saying, ""Yes"" or ""No"" to him. It was so dull that even the naval battle at the end could not pull me out of apathy.As with Elizabeth Taylor's acting, she is good for the first half as a strong, determined leader, but for the rest of the movie she just wore pretty costumes and cries when her relationship goes down between Antony. I overall have mixed feelings for this movie. I would give the first half a 9 but the other half a 3. So that averages to 6/10.-Now doubt this was the starting point of where great acting and plot was not needed to make a film, as is most films nowadays.",Cleopatra
75,FloatingOpera7,Epic Historical Romance: Cleopatra,10,13 November 2007,"Cleopatra (1963): Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Martin Landau, Roddy McDowall, Kenneth Haigh, George Cole, Hume Cronyn, Pamela Brown, Andrew Keir, Cesare Danova, Francesca Annis, Robert Stephens, Gregoire Aslan, John Cairney, Isabel Cooley, Michael Hordern, John Hoyt, Carroll O'Connor, Richard O'Sullivan, Gwen Watford, Jean Marsh....Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Screenplay...Rouben Mamoulian, Darryl F. Zanuck, From The Book by Carlo Mario Franzero.In 1963, cinema was about to change as the times were changing. It was the year that President J.F.K. was murdered on live television and marks the real beginning of the turbulent decade. Many movies, however, still employed older Hollywood legends, often acting with newer stars in serious dramatic films. The genre of ""ancien times epics"" was nothing new and previous films like ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" had enjoyed enormous success. In Director Joseph Mankiewicz ""Cleopatra"", Elizabeth Taylor portrays the renowned Queen of the Nile and the film follows her experiences from the moment she first meets Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) to her relationship with Marc Antony (Richard Burton) to her alleged suicide by snake bite. The film has a running time of almost four hours and was an expensive, overblown historical epic that many considered to be the end of such films. Elizabeth Taylor was an established star at this point and made headlines with her numerous affairs like the one she was carrying with Richard Burton whom she would marry. Rex Harrison was doing ""My Fair Lady"" at this time. While there is much to admire, there's also many flaws to point out. The long script, drawn from an Italian history writer, is stuffy, stilted and Shakesperean. Each of the principal actors - Taylor, Burton and Harrison, each have Shakespearean style monologues in which they poetically express their loves, losses and philosophies. Far from being historically accurate, this movie portrays Cleopatra as an overly ambitious queen who loved two powerful men, the typical and ""flat"" characteristics that have been attributed to her for years. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is nothing special. She has her diva moments, such as the melodramatic scene in which she discovers that Marc Antony has married Octavia, a marriage of political significance. She flies into a fit of rage as only Elizabeth Taylor could do. She portrays Cleopatra as power-driven and mighty but at the same time feminine and vulnerable. She wears a different gown in every scene and the entire film is built around her, coming to a climax in the lavish Parade scene in Rome. Taylor was also doing things actresses of her celebrity would not do like showing more skin than previously allowed in scenes such as her milk bath. In addition, during the Parade scene the dancing slave girls show more nudity than films had previously allowed. Rex Harrison, in full British accent and demeanor, is out of place as Caesar and too old-looking. Burton does a marvelous job as Antony but like everyone else, he's hamming it up. Even Roddy McDowal as Octavian and many of the actors portraying Senators and Cleopatra's advisors, have moments of genuine hamminess. So what makes this movie so great despite all the big time drama ? There's the costumes which are beautiful to look at, the set designs and sceneries (construction of palaces and ships were made). The music by Alex North is gorgeous, full of bombastic themes and romantic, exotic melodies. And, not least of all, there's the romance. Despite the political and historical stuff, we feel a little misty eyed when we see how Cleopatra's dreams are foiled by Fate and by Rome's power. Caesar is killed and her son by him will never be king. Her love for Antony is similarly thwarted as Octavian, Caesar's appointed heir, comes after them. Her suicide scene is tragic and noble at the same time. The attention to detail is evident and the movie is among the ranks of other epic films like ""Gone With The Wind"" ""The Ten Commandments"" ""Ben Hur"" ""Spartacus"" ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" and others. The cinematography is splendid and the film was shot in the latest Panavision-type cameras, and the color is a sensual exotic feast of Mediterranean colors. But other than that, this film is one that you have to watch without paying attention to all the little flaws, the biggest being Taylor's diva-esquire scenes, which, after too many of them, makes it hard for us to sympathize with her or to care for fate. Truly a film of its times.",Cleopatra

77,silverscreen888,Forget Taylor and Burton; This is Mostly a Very Intelligent Epic,7,19 June 2005,"A fine account of the making of ""Cleopatra"" has been compiled; and the movie has been seen and appreciated by millions worldwide. Everyone knows by now how an interesting historical dramatic project gradually grew into the most expensive and lengthy production in film history... incidentally, ""Cleopatra"" finally earned a profit. There are seven credited writers and four directors; but the production will always be attributed chiefly to Jospeh L. Mankiewicz. The cinematography Leon Shamroy and music by Alex Northh are also well- remembered in this film, and the costumes, sets, second-unit and stunt challenges clearly must have been immense. What is forgotten about the film is that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor did not have to play the parts they did; and their shortcoming along with a few poorly-written lines here and there are the only negatives most persons take away from this interesting and frequently- beautiful dramatized era of Roman history. I saw this film when it premiered at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood; I did not like the vast barge used to parade Cleopatra into Rome; but it was spectacular; and the decision to stage the important battle of Pharsalia and then use none of the footage save for the aftermath deprived us of some fascinating scenes. But I appreciate this film, even more so today, especially the recreation of Alexandria and the scenes set in Rome and within the Egyptian palace. So I will confine myself here to a look here at the actors involved. The immense cast was headed by Liz Taylor, who cannot do a classical accent and Burton who was a few years from his best work, but who here was objectionable because he was on the edge of verbal bombast and because of lack of vocal variety. On the other hand, many critics praised the fine work turned in by many others, beginning with Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar, Roddy Macdowall as Octavius, Martin Landau, John Doucette, Hume Cronyn, Robert Stephens, Pamela Brown, Cesare Danova, and others in supporting roles. Thhis expensive mounting of history sinpred many later producers. The climactic sea battle is beautifully staged, the lighting, sound, sets and other elements are everywhere sumptuous and also often intelligently-used. This epic film is a fine achievement in many ways; and that it holds together as well as it does is a tribute to expert writer and director Maniewiwcz above all.",Cleopatra
78,roedyg,A spectacle like you will not see again,7,14 November 2016,"This truly has a cast of thousands. All before the age of CGI, there are hordes of costumed people all doing something all the way to the horizon. It is spectacular.Elizabeth Taylor is supposed to be playing a teenager. No amount of makeup can disguise the fact she is 30. I pegged her as 40 because of her double chin and rather plump back and thighs that she reveals in a massage scene.Cleopatra is a spoiled brat, and nobody plays spoiled brats better than Elizabeth Taylor.I thought it would be all costumes and spectacle, but it has an interesting and involved plot.The violence in the first part of the movie tends to occur off screenThe most jarring scenes were the dancing girls in either Day-Glo bikinis or pasties looking like they had just stepped out of a Texas stripper bar. The real Egyptians were not shy about breasts. Day-Glo colours abound. I am pretty sure they had not been invented yet.For pure spectacle, Cleopatra's entrance into Rome is indeed amazing. Each stage of it is replaced by something even more astounding.What makes this movie work are the crowd scenes. The whole screen is alive with action. There is so much going on, you cannot possibly take it all in. These crowd scenes are so much more impressive than anything you see in modern movies.One of the odd things, though many of the characters lead entire countries, they never spend any time at all in administration. They make no laws, consult with no committees etc. One scene I found jarring was when the library at Alexandria burned. Cleopatra expressed distress that a Jewish bible had been destroyed. I found that highly improbable. Compare that with the one-of-a-kind Greek and Roman documents lost.Cleopatra is such schemer. She is so Machiavellian. She is like Lady Macbeth with her snake-like ambition. You would think anyone on encountering her would run in the other direction. Yet we know from history both Caesar and Mark Anthony were ensnared. In the scenes where she tries to be seductive, I just felt creeped out. Perhaps in 1962 that sort of behaviour was considered sexy. Perhaps she was trying to project insincerity.There is a great scene where Octavian persuades the senate to go to war with Egypt for the silliest reason. The ensuing war is pointless and depressing. The wild excitement at the start of the war contrasts with the sombre actuality.I normally find battle scenes in movies exceedingly boring. However, here they were interesting, fascinating and original. They were full of terror, sadness and dread.The language, especially in some of the longer speeches was stilted. I had some trouble understanding it. It was almost Shakespearian. The musical score has nothing in it that evokes Rome or Egypt. It is like Mantovani soaring strings. It feels out of place.",Cleopatra
79,sashank_kini-1,"O monstrous thing, how long thy tale Cleopatra, Yet no emotions thee bring!",3,15 February 2012,"Usually a passerby witnessing an accident isn't impacted deeply by the injured's plight; similarly, Cleopatra, the movie always kept my feelings at a distance; I witnessed betrayal, corruption, authority, trust, love, grief, but never vicariously experienced them. This mammoth production feels like a dispassionate documentary, taking me right from Caesar's rise and fall to Antony's. But in the 251 minutes of it's run-length, I never was moved even once. Cleopatra is a regal shame (and sham), so extravagantly produced and draped in a sea of bright colors you may get a seizure. It's resources, like a politician's election campaign, go into external detailing. As for the emotions, it was a dry well. It shamefully portrayed it's titular characters- Cleopatra, Caesar and Antony with flippancy and indifference. The costumes were so flashy, I thought I was watching that Heidi Klum show. Many of the costumes were awkward and cheesy and loud, like the music which too played for most of the film. The music,I have to say, destroyed the little impact that could've come from the actors by overplaying in important scenes. The sets, so complex in construction, almost upstaged the actors themselves. In short, such radical arrangements were unnecessary.The story, in spite of it's run length, was not enough to be contained in one part. Much of the time went into unnecessary scenes that could've been edited out, especially when Caesar and Antony's lives had many important events. The performances were campy and dreadful, coming from actors of such high caliber. Harrison as Caesar resorted to cheap tricks with an affected speech plentiful of intonations; it is shocking that this same man was the best thing about My Fair Lady. Even Meryl Streep would've played Caesar with more authority and conviction that he did. Elizabeth Taylor gave a repulsive Cleopatra, radiating none of the passion and wisdom that her charter required. She committed the crime of killing passion. She was neither convincing as Caesar's nor Antony's lover, apart from butchering her character. She spoils the otherwise well shot scene of Caesar's murder with her overacting. Richard Burton was minced meat compared to Russell Crowe's valiant Maximus while Martin Landau was equally theatrical, swinging his arms in an unnatural manner. Richard O'Sullivan was embarrassing as Ptolemy; only god knows what happened to his character. I was neither impressed with Roddy McDowell. In fact, most of the cast had that theater hangover, forgetting that they have to act suitably for the cameras. Only Gwen Walford created an impression in her tiny role as Calpunria I really hoped that Cleopatra was as impressive as the DVD cover with Taylor and Burton on it. All I got was messy schlock. My Rating: 3 out of 10",Cleopatra

The version I saw was four hours long, but it was paced well enough that I didn't notice the length.Elizabeth Taylor was never the world's greatest actress, but she is terrible here. The script wasn't particularly good in the first place, but her static line delivery makes it even worse. Richard Burton does his best as Antony, but it's funny that the film got a lot of publicity due to Taylor and Burton's affair, as they have absolutely no chemistry together on screen.Rex Harrison is easily the best actor in the film, and was understandably the only one to get nominated for an Oscar. The film definitely becomes duller after Caesar is assassinated. Roddy McDowall gives a good performance as Augustus.Unlike other historical epics, there are no big action sequences, which is disappointing. However, the set design and costumes are stunning.If I wanted to watch a historical epic, I'd rather watch Quo Vadis or The Ten Commandments.

84,chaswe-28402,Has its moments. Not too many though.,5,12 August 2016,"Undeniably spectacular sets and settings, off and on. Amazingly soporific dialogue unimaginatively spoken by miscast actors. Rex Harrison is patrician enough, but he's not my idea of a little, epileptic, balding, battle-hardened veteran who has fought his way from Rome to the British Isles and back; and Miss Taylor is definitely not my idea of Cleopatra. She's more like a chubby housewife from a London suburb, giving herself airs. It's the director and the script that make a movie. They've managed to make more or less nothing here. I'm talking about the first half of the 2 DVD discs, and am taking a few hours off, to recuperate, by scribbling a few thoughts.Back to the sittathon. Contrary to a lot of the opinions on this website, I thought the second disc was slightly better, acting-wise, than the first. Burton was more passionately emotive, and even Liz improved a little. I wouldn't say they were anything special however. Roddy McDowall seemed to me abysmally miscast as Octavian, but I suppose he did his best. There had obviously been an effort to replicate the man's actual appearance, but I can't believe the historical Augustus was quite so fragile looking. In the first disc the entry of Cleopatra's entourage into Rome was definitely spectacular. I can't believe her actual entry was anything remotely like it. In the second disc, the battle of Actium had me lost, I regret to say. I gather the reason this half of the film flowed so badly and was so difficult to follow was because large chunks had been cut from the narrative to reduce the film from 6 hours to 4. If I've got that right. The result was something of a butchered mess. I did wind up feeling sad. But can't bring myself to award more than half marks.",Cleopatra
85,Al_The_Strange,Cleopatra review,7,26 May 2013,"Back in the day, Cleopatra promised to offer the same brand of entertainment that had been such a hit with movies like Ben Hur: a massive and expensive epic with thousands of extras, huge setpieces, and dazzling star-power. It was so big, its sheer budget nearly ran Fox Studios to the ground.The film is definitely a lavish sight to behold. The settings are very expansive and imaginatively rendered; the costumes are glamorous; the actors present very passionate performances. There are a couple of major battles, where giant armies (or navies) assemble on screen and launch flaming projectiles at each other. At times, the film shines brilliantly with its ambition and glamor.However, sitting through the film is also a chore at times. It runs for four hours, and in between the more interesting and exciting scenes, there's a lot of padding with the dialogue and politics. It's not a total bore, but the distance between the major plot and character points seemed so far in between, it can test one's patience.Which is a shame, because there's much to be said about the timeless story of Julius Caesar, Cleopatra VII, and Marc Anthony. History buffs will already be familiar with the story, and the film does the whole affair decent justice. The film maintains decent accuracy, despite one or two anachronisms and liberties. The story overall is solidly constructed, and the characters are given good attention. Some of the most interesting scenes focus on the characters constantly competing for control over each other, and ultimately control over the kingdoms of Rome and Egypt. However, most of the conflict is kept subtle, and thus contributes to the slow pacing of the movie.With no expense spared on the film, it looks very lavish and competent. It's well-shot and well-edited. Acting is swell: I grew quite fond of Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal of the title character, while Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, and Roddy McDowell do their best to make their characters bold and powerful. Writing is quite detailed and elegant. This production has some very gorgeous sets, props, and costumes; however, certain things look a little too plastic, and certain things (especially Cleopatra's wardrobe) look a little too 20th century. The music score is quite lovely too.This film is probably more memorable for the behind-the-scenes dilemmas that cemented its fate as a moderate box office flop. Aside from going tremendously over-budget, Elizabeth Taylor nearly perished during an illness while filming, and had to be rushed to the hospital for an emergency tracheotomy. The production had to be relocated to Rome for a while, and during the editing process, the film was wheedled down beyond the director's desired runtime. In spite of these issues, the film was considered the end of a magnificent era, in the same fashion as Cleopatra's death marked the end of a historic era.Despite the sheer length and slow pacing of the film, I am glad to have seen it, for it has its moments. I'm particularly fond of its performances and setpieces; I just wish there was more to it.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Marginal | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Very Good)",Cleopatra
86,rowmorg,Taylor: the vacuum at the centre of this picture,5,15 January 2009,"Why don't we come out with the truth? Elizabeth Taylor ruined this film. She never even hinted at the extraordinary personality who was descended from the blond Alexander the Great, spoke seven languages and was one of the best-educated people in the ancient world. She agreed to wear those awful pantomime costumes, in which she never once looked Egyptian. Her court dancers could have been transferred directly to the stages of the casinos of 1960s Las Vegas. The most we ever saw of this legendary temptress, who seduced the two most powerful men of her day, was a lowish neckline and a little bit of leg. On the other hand, never in the entire production did she appear regal. Princess Diana had twice the glamour.A glance at Ms Taylor's background explains a lot. She never trained as an actress, but was adopted as a pretty-faced child player by friends of her socialite parents, who had an art gallery for the wealthy in Beverly Hills. As a child star she played opposite a horse (National Velvet) and a dog (Lassie). As an adult actress, her first two films were B.O. turkeys. The notoriety of Cleopatra arose chiefly from her whoring and boozing with Burton around Rome, which gave the paparazzi and gossip-mongers a field-day. Cast opposite Rex Harrison, she appeared silly, and opposite Burton, inadequate. All those fans who can't wait for the six-hour version will still be saddled with the vacuum she creates at the heart of the action.",Cleopatra
87,RiffRaffMcKinley,It's Not A Train Wreck. It's The Rescue Effort.,10,22 March 2008,"People are often drawn to the fact that ""Cleopatra"" was the most expensive movie of all time and, naturally, one of (if not the one) the biggest flops of all time. People, then, watch the movie expecting to see some horrifyingly fascinating disaster. What they get is a movie that provides more solid entertainment than anything of its kind. When expecting Elizabeth Taylor to be a putrid nightmare, they get her one notable performance. When thinking they'll shut it off after the first two hours (merely half the common cut of the movie), they hopefully end up realizing that *that* would be the waste of time. In other words, Mankiewicz' ""Cleopatra"" is well worth what is now a multi-billion dollar price tag, especially in a modern Hollywood where films like ""Troy"" (shudder) and ""Titanic"" (twelve concurrent shudders) are what audiences expect from movies that are longer than 140 minutes. It is almost like a prophetic attempt to save moviegoers of the 21st century by providing fans of real entertainment with the opportunity to say, ""Wait! It doesn't have to be like this!"" Yes, it's four hours long. But those four hours are packed with fantastic performances, mind-blowing spectacle (especially the Queen's entrance into Rome in the first half), and even a host of unbelievable appearances (which include Carroll O'Connor-- Archie Bunker's in the picture!) On the surface: Liz Taylor seducing her way to the top in a gigantic, expensive, overblown mess of a movie. In reality, the most lasting testament to the good aspects of dreaming-- and doing-- big.",Cleopatra
88,TheHonestCritic,"This is one of the longest Hollywood films in the history of cinema. But, does that impact the story?",10,14 February 2021,"""Cleopatra"" (1963), I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was back in one of my high school social studies classes. We were talking about the Battle of Pharsalus. During that unit, we discussed the story of Cleopatra, Julius Caesar and Marc Antony. Rather than take a huge test on the subject, my teacher had us watch this film. On the day he put it on, my teacher joked, and said: ""this movie is just about four hours and six minutes long, if you take away the opening and end credits!"" Of course, the mammoth length really surprised us. I've seen a lot of long movies up to that point, but none over four hours. The length seemed to intimidate my fellow classmates. But, much to mine and my classmates' total shock, we were hooked right from the start. Since our high school classes were 50 minutes long, it took us six days to finish the film! Isn't that something? That being said, me and my whole class absolutely loved it and I was fully invested all the way through from beginning to end. ""Cleopatra"" has a fantastic story, perfect acting, beautiful sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a phenomenal soundtrack to tie it all together. The storyline is all about Cleopatra's struggles to resist the imperial ambitions of Rome. At first glance, the synopsis of the plot does sound basic. But, let me assure you, it is anything but basic. The story of Cleopatra is one of the most significant in history, and it's just as simple as it is complex. But, the script for this film is so well-written that the four plus hours go by in a flash. Seriously, it does not feel like it's four hours long. You blink, and it's over! When a long movie goes by fast, then you know it's a winner. The storyline is perfectly executed, but my only nitpick, and this is only a tiny nitpick, is maybe it could've been about an hour shorter? That being said, for a plot of this caliber, the length is necessary to express the full story onto the screen. One part in particular that could've been shortened, is Cleopatra's grand entrance into Rome. That scene lasts over five minutes and it's only for an entrance! There are a few scenes like that, where if they were shortened, could've made the film be executed more to the point. But, like I said, it's just a nitpick and those extra scenes don't hurt the film in any way. In fact, Cleopatra's entrance into Rome is one of my personal favorite scenes in the movie! In the end, the four hour plus length is needed to tell the story. As far as the acting goes, it's sublime, from all of the actors and actresses! But, the shining star is Elizabeth Taylor. She was born to play this role, and out of all the movies and TV shows I've seen her in, this is, by far, her best acting performance! Rex Harrison and Richard Burton also do a stellar job as well. Fun fact: not too long after this movie was made, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton got married. During the production of ""Cleopatra"", both of them were actually dating in real-life and their chemistry really shines on the screen. All of the sets/locations are stunning and really give the film a breathtaking atmosphere! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Alex North is phenomenal. His film score really elevated the story and definitely helped to bring it to life! My personal favorite part of the soundtrack is the ""Entr'acte"" (Caesar & Cleopatra) theme. The whole film score is exceptional, but the ""Entr'acte"" theme really highlights the movie and sets the tone perfectly. Whenever I listen to it, I get goosebumps all the way through. That's the mark of a brilliant film soundtrack, props to you, Alex North! ""Cleopatra"" is an absolute masterpiece of cinema. Here's a little piece of history for you all: during the time of it's original release, ""Cleopatra"" was the most expensive movie ever made, and it actually almost bankrupted 20th Century Studios (formerly known as 20th Century Fox). The biggest costs were the sets/locations and all the hundreds of hired extras that you see on-screen. One of the sets had to be constructed twice, and every costume for all of the actors and actresses had to be made from scratch. Fun fact: Elizabeth Taylor held the record for most costume changes in this movie. She alone, wore 65 different outfits. Now, that's what I call dedication! However, that record was eventually surpassed by the movie, ""Star!"" (1968), where Julie Andrews wore 125 costumes. But regardless, at the end of the day, all of that money was worth it and it's our very good fortune that this gem of a movie was made. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Cleopatra"" yet, go and see it today, especially if you love history, like me. There are many movie and TV show adaptations of Cleopatra out there, but this film adaptation is by far the best one. It may be over four hours long, but it's one of the shortest four hours you will ever experience watching a movie. I love a long film well-told, and ""Cleopatra"" is one of the best ""long films"" I've ever seen. Go and watch it today, or Cleopatra might declare an order for you to be executed!",Cleopatra
89,jcolyer1229,Cleopatra 1963,7,26 June 2018,"Rex Harrison is Julius Caesar with a British accent. Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra, and Richard Burton is Marc Antony. Cleopatra gives the first half of this long movie to Caesar and the second half to Antony. It makes use of my 3 years of Latin. I saw it that summer with my first girl friend. Egypt meets Rome! I admit the history was over my head at age 17, but I have since grown into it. Caesar was murdered by his friends, while Cleopatra and Antony committed suicide. We only catch a glimpse of the cobra as it slithers away. In 1963, Hollywood was not yet willing to shock audiences. Wimpy Roddy McDowell plays wimpy Octavian, who went on to inherit the Roman Empire. The summer of 1963 was a season of overblown productions, another of which was How the West Was Won.",Cleopatra
90,fimimix,WOW! could it be produced today ?,10,28 May 2006,"It is difficult to believe, still, that I bought this fabulous movie - from eBay - on two VHS cassettes for less than $15.00. In 1963, when its production - we are told - costs $40 million, in that year's currency I may have paid fifty cents !! Looking at the sumptuous sets - the gold-metallic paint must have been a huge part of the budget, not to mention the gold-plating for jewelry, etc. - and the panoramic view of the battle between Octavian and Antony (with real ships and thousands of sailors, then the huge army later), it is highly doubtful anything on such a grand scale could be made today, wouldn't you agree? The ""barge""-scene is glorious. AND - ...that's only what we see as the film has been released as it is today - what about those other two hours that are missing? Several commentators has stated that Ms. Taylor's salary - $1 million - makes her the highest-paid actress of all times. Perhaps with inflation in today's dollar that could be possible, but I'd have to be shown in hard figures it's anywhere near what actors/actresses who are paid $20 million-and-more. In my mind, I don't think there's anyone worth that kind of money....for one film? You can be sure of one thing: Ms. Taylor's take from ""Cleopatra"" was far in excess of her salary: she just happened to own the patented ToddAO lenses it was filmed in. Her husband, Richard Todd, bequeathed them to her at his death. So, ANY movie shot with those lenses put money into her pocket.The use of these lenses are what makes the clarity of ""Cleopatra"" so spectacular - twice that of 35mm. Mankiewicz may have been forced to cut his film, but he can rest assured there isn't any other movie that is as brilliantly filmed as this movie is. I haven't viewed the DVD version, but THAT must surely be breathtaking. All of those people who are seeing this version are far too young to remember how grainy some regular prints were. All of these ""old"" movies are being re-released in digital-computerized formats - how fortunate we are today ! SO: ....to me, it is highly unbelievable that the studios DON'T KNOW where the ""lost"" film-footage is. Huh? One day, they'll re-release ""Cleopatra"" in is original version and make millions more.This movie is timeless - Mankiewicz and Hecht had the good fortune to write from the histories of Plutarch and Seutonius....very good sources, wouldn't you say? What does it matter that some of what we see isn't factually historical? The movie could have been filmed with a much smaller budget, but all of those thousands of crafters made what we are seeing as a finished product. Astounding ! Every penny we see on the screen. Why nit-pick over an epic film in which we can get lost? I wouldn't care if it were eight hours long. In the version I have, although I can't tell you exactly where in the movie it is, you can see exactly where a large cut was made - the screen is dark for at least three seconds, then continues-on a coupla-more hours in its grandeur.As some have written, if Rome and Egypt weren't the way they were depicted, they SHOULD have been. Don't you want to believe it? Harrison, Burton, McDowall, Cronyn and the galaxy of other big stars certainly helped to make the movie an epic, but it was the great numbers of extras - some of whom we never saw - that really fills-up the screen and makes the movie so spectacular. However: It IS Ms. Taylor's film - she just happened to be the most gorgeous lady of our times, and it is fitting they filmed her to highlight her great beauty - and, her acting was pretty good, too. Brava Liz ! It is so seldom we can witness (for the couple of dollars we pay) a movie so magical, why don't we just let our minds go blank and get into it? During this country's Great Depression, it was movies - even as they were then - that helped its citizens realize they could-and-would survive the poverty and remain the great nation we are. ""Cleopatra"" does the same thing today - it is timeless.P.S.: the only other actress I can think of who possessed such great beauty was Hedy LaMarr - who could be filmed from any angle.",Cleopatra
91,Aly200,Interesting Tale of Egypt's Best Known Queen,6,4 August 2012,"Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton take on the story of Cleopatra and her famous lover Marc Anthony in this 1963 adaption. The story is one that numerous people know from history and also Shakespeare's play 'Antony and Cleopatra.' The story is overall pretty well written to match the story we are familiar with. Miss Taylor's acting is the highest point of the entire film as she plays the famous queen opposite two strong leading men of the time. Burton as Marc Antony is an adequate performance, but he is still worth watching. Rex Harrison even has an appearance as the mighty Julius Caesar and is extraordinary. If you do like historical dramas, this may be one for you but not myself.",Cleopatra
92,jamesjustice-92,Majestic spectacle,10,14 June 2021,"How important can a life of one person be to another one? To the country? The whole world? Because people who leave the latter kind of steps in the hearts of millions are either universally loved or hated. But even if a person touched only one soul in his lifetime it would be enough to get the recognition he needs to become a somebody in the world consisting mostly of nobodies.The renowned persona of Cleopatra was truly a stand-out from the crowd, loved by so many, adored by many more and envied by a whole lot more and for such a short life of hers she managed to be remembered for millennia to come since her death.As probably many of people know the production on 1963's Cleopatra was troubled to say the least - it went over budget multiple times becoming and remaining the most expensive movie for more than 30 years, changed the director and many leading actors, and nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox - but despite all that it became one of the greatest epic dramas ever told on screen. It even went on to receive nine Academy Awards nominations but had won only four of those, and sadly just in technical categories - and there couldn't be any argument about it as the movie feels absolutely breathtaking from start to finish with its gorgeous cinematography, the hugest set pieces, fine visuals, astounding costume design with its 65 different outfits for just Cleopatra alone - it all has set many records back in the days and looks just as impressive today.Rex Harrison, Richard Burton and especially Elizabeth Taylor have all poured their hearts into this piece of cinematic art and became just as legendary as the characters they portrayed; their story has become not just another love triangle of trials and tribulations stretched out to 4 hours of runtime but the immortal tale that will stay relevant for centuries, where love is stronger than anything else, where envy and jealousy kills deadlier than a blade of a sword and where death is just a beginning.",Cleopatra

Do yourself a favor and rent Ben Hur or Spartacus. They are very entertaining, especially compared to this effort.",Cleopatra

It's an image I am going to remember forever.The cast is perfect. Who else could pull off the arrogance of Cleopatra while still showing her soft side than Elizabeth Taylor. And who but Richard Burton could match her and be her Antony? Add in Rex Harrison as Caesar and Roddy McDowell as Octavian, and you have a cast that can't be beat! I can't think of a thing I would change about this movie. It shouldn't ever be remade!",Cleopatra
95,ThomasColquith,Overly-indulgent and Overly long,3,12 August 2021,"""Cleopatra"" is much too long of a film; it is a veritable chore to get through, and there is no payoff at the end. The film goes downhill the entire way, especially the second half, but even the first half was tough to get through and reach the intermission. Caesar's death could have been the end of the film at 2 hours in, but unmercifully it continued ponderously on another 2 hours. There was no urgency about editing and conforming this piece to fit an approachable run-time. While the technicals were good, such as the sets, costumes, and cinematography, there was often just not enough of interest happening on-screen to keep the viewer engaged. I, a plebeian, can only stomach so much royal machinations and pomp and circumstance before I get bored and tune-out. It was perhaps worth watching once, although I still feel like I just wasted 4 hours (spread out over 3 sittings). So my rating: 3/10. I would only recommend to those who especially like these types of films -- old, long, well-made historical epics.",Cleopatra
96,FountainPen,A stunning achievement for 1963 !,9,5 March 2018,"What does it take for someone to rate this epic motion picture 1/10 ? 
Well, you could ask ""valgreet"" who says the movie is ""Just about unwatchable"". That IMDb member of 12 years has, in that time, reviewed only about as many flicks. I think it is a shame that the absurd 1/10 rating should appear. Over several decades, I've watched a few thousand movies, and have reviewed hundreds, here on IMDb and elsewhere. There is NO way anyone could possibly justify a rating below 7/10, all factors considered. A rating of 1/10 or 2/10 is especially vicious, I feel. 
""Cleopatra"" is a landmark film, especially noteworthy in many areas, and certainly not just for the presence of Burton and Taylor. It is a picture that any serious moviegoer needs to see, preferably on as large a screen as possible.

97,BillBayard,They don't make them like this anymore,5,8 November 2021,"And that's not such a bad thing. Whatever version you see of this, and there are a few, it will be too long. Long, laborious and already creaky, this tale of the great love triangle of Cleopatra, Marc Anthony and Julius Caesar is a toughie to get through, though it has its moments and it is a big part of Hollywood history. However, it's a Hollywood that no longer exists, for better or worse. Katharine Hepburn once called Elizabeth Taylor the last movie star and she was correct, but she was referring to the movie stars and studios of a now by-gone era. At the time it was released this was the most expensive film ever made and much of the country was captivated or revulsed by the personal lives of Taylor and Richard Burton. This is the first of their many films together, with only one exceptional entry among them, and neither are at their best here. She's gorgeous, but just too modern for the part and he hadn't yet learned to tame down his theatrical background for the screen and chews up the scenery a bit. They do, however, hold your interest, particularly her. At the time a lot of that interest was also due to their offscreen lives as well and their ""great and notorious romance"" while this was being filmed. Rex Harrison gives by far the best performance in this gargantuan film. It's hard to imagine these days, but all that you see was designed and created. CGI has changed the film world, and one would think, has reduced some budgets and probably has eliminated some jobs as well. For those with patience, this is a piece of Hollywood history.",Cleopatra
98,lyubitelfilmov,The undeserved failure of an epic masterpiece or the Life and death of an Egyptian queen,10,31 May 2021,"Historical drama. One of my favorite historical paintings in the ""Pellum"" genre, which I first saw when I was a small backgnaw, which gave another impetus to my fascination with history, especially military history. I revised the picture six times, already at a conscious age, and this review was an excellent reason to revise this masterpiece for the seventh time. Yes, you heard right, it is a masterpiece that I will never stop loving. Therefore, here is my brief opinion - Life and death of the Egyptian queen. Despite my love and even in some way trepidation in relation to this picture, I will talk about both its protruding advantages in all senses, and about the shortcomings that I paid attention to only now, strewn with a baggage of knowledge, so to speak. Now let me finish this long introduction and get to the point.So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - conditionally it can be divided into two parts: ""Cleopatra and Caesar"" and ""Cleopatra and Antony"". For in a little over four hours, we will see the story of the accession to the throne, reign, love, life and finally death of the legendary queen of Egypt from the Ptolemaic dynasty Cleopatra, who influenced two of the greatest figures of Rome - Gaius Julius Caesar and Mark Antony a tremendous influence, and its decisions changed not only Rome, but the whole world, and the story of her love for Antony inspired the great Shakespeare so much that he wrote a tragedy, forever immortalized their names in history. Cleopatra is shown not only as a passionate and beautiful woman, but also as a cunning politician, thinning for the interests of Egypt, with the ambitions of the great Alexander. Politics and passion play here so mingled that it becomes almost impossible to separate one from the other. But it doesn't get boring. On the contrary, the viewer is immersed in this heap of key events of the Ancient World, which determined its appearance for the next centuries. The script is written qualitatively (despite the production hell through which the picture went), spectacular, exciting and has many more things. What is important for a picture with such a long timekeeping.2. Epic - costumes, grandiose scenery, real ships, and a huge number of extras were attracted to recreate Ancient Egypt and Rome on the screen. And it worked. The viewer does not even have a shadow of doubt that he is in the distant past, where these grandiose events unfold. Yes, and the budget allowed (almost fifty lemons in prices of the early sixties, which makes it the most expensive painting of this genre of its time). A colossal work that amazes even now, in our age of computer graphics and wooden acting. A well-deserved plus from a loving viewer!3. Music - I can't say that it is a masterpiece for all time, but within the framework of the picture, it is an ideal option, because it works as expected, because it emphasizes the epic nature when given, drama, joy, pain, longing, and so on. The overture together with the intermission add atmosphere.4. Atmosphere - costumes, scenery, music and superbly selected actors immerse the viewer in that era and make us imbued with the heroes, worry about them, draw conclusions about their future fate (unless of course you have read the history textbook for the fifth grade).5. Memorable scenes - the battle at Cape Shares, the triumphant arrival of Cleopatra in Rome, the brutal and insidious murder of Caesar in the Senate, the love of Cleopatra and Antony, and of course their tragic end (this is not a spoiler, if anything). These are only those that I remember most of all and were engraved in my memory as a child. I think you have some scenes from this list that come up in your memory when you mention this picture.6. Great acting game - there is not a single passing hero, each actor is in his place and almost ideally falls into the image. There is no replay, no underplay, everything is clear and exactly as needed in this particular scene, this frame. Learn, young students of theaters and future film actors exactly on this example!So the disadvantages:
1. Historical inconsistencies - the Arch of Constantine, which at the time of Caesar did not exist yet, Admiral Agrippa wears a beard (which the Romans considered a sign of barbarism), the image of Cleopatra (who was not a beauty) and much more. This does not make the picture immediately bad, since everything else has been done for a solid five, just these little things will be noticeable only to dedicated people who ""rummage around"", and the ordinary viewer will not even notice this, because he is watching an excellent historical feature film.2. Spectacularity of battles - today they are not able to surprise and make the viewer enjoy themselves, if only keep in mind the thought that everything was filmed live. In this regard, the picture is a little outdated, but only in this!A little about the main characters:
1. Queen Cleopatra performed by Elizabeth Taylor is a cunning ruler of Egypt who, through intrigue and passion, drove mad two of the strongest rulers and commanders of Rome, who could not resist her charm. Although she could not see far, and at some moments she behaved like an ordinary woman who was allegedly abandoned. It should be said that no one has ever been able to play this role better than Elizabeth Taylor so convincingly and passionately, although many tried even before her (Vivien Leigh, for example) and even after, but no one could surpass the beautiful Elizabeth, and will not be able to!2. Guy Julius Caesar performed by Rex Harrison is a Roman commander and statesman who wanted to put an end to the outrage of rams from the Senate, for which he paid with his life. Shown as a brave and wise man, although in the end he fell victim to Cleopatra. It should be said that the creators did not fail with Rex for this role. He perfectly fit into the image of this legendary man, who is still remembered all over the world. I saw many actors who played this role, but Rex takes the honorable first place, the second is Gottfried Yon from the picture ""Asterix and Obelix against Caesar"", and Alain Delon from the picture ""Asterix at the Olympic Games"" closes the trinity. Bravo Rex! Bravo!3. Mark Antony performed by Richard Burton is a faithful ally of Julius Caesar, and after that the main enemy of Octavian Augustus - the heir of Caesar, their confrontation will result in a civil war. He is shown as a generally strong and courageous man, a skillful and experienced commander, until he fell under the spell of Cleopatra, which gave us one of the most tragic and passionate love stories in world history. And the romance between Elizabeth and Richard only contributed to their screen ""spark"". My compliments to Richard!Unfortunately, this epic picture was awaited by a box office failure, which buried the Pellum genre for a long time, because with its far from small budget it could not even go to zero, which almost led to the bankruptcy of the film studio. I can't say what was the reason, maybe the audience was saturated with pictures of this genre and therefore this masterpiece was ignored, although the picture was bought for Soviet distribution and it gathered a lot of viewers from us. It's a shame that for such a colossal work, the creators received only production hell on the set, devastating criticism, and broken careers. After all, the cult came later. Time has judged everything. ""Cleopatra"" won and earned the high title of ""masterpiece"", and I completely agree with that!As a result, we have an excellent epic historical drama about the Egyptian queen, with an excellent script, epic production, interweaving of politics and passion, great music and masterpiece acting, especially the main trinity!My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Cleopatra
99,robsta23,Good as Epics Should Be,9,10 August 2015,"I just have to start by saying I am a big fan of the epic even if I don't fully understand them on first viewing - I need to rewatch Lawrence of Arabia specifically. It is unfair to say that these movies aren't great since so much effort was put into them in order to make them superior in production value. The sets are massive, they require the careful direction of many extras in some scenes, and they usually have great leading performances.While this film does follow the life and accomplishments of Cleopatra, much of the time we are either focused on Caesar - the entire first half of the film - and Mark Antony, as Cleopatra was able to manipulate these men for her benefit, Antony more so than Caesar. For the film as a whole, I'd have to say that at most a third of the time is devoted to Cleopatra, so I am not convinced that this movie should be considered a character study for Cleopatra or that Elizabeth Taylor should be considered the sole lead. Though we don't see her as much as the title of the film insinuates, I suppose she is the driving force of the film, so it is a barely suitable title.It is a little annoying that throughout the first half of the film, Caesar refers to himself in the third person, so it took me about half an hour to figure out that he was Caesar.While I do enjoy epics, I don't think that this is one of the better ones out there, but it is still great for what it accomplishes. As I had stated in the first paragraph, it is impressive to see these films made in the era they come from since the production is massive and seems as though it couldn't possibly be done back in the 60's or even before then. That is what this film feels like - the action sequences are amazing and well-choreographed and very well-put- together in general. Even in unexciting scenes we have a huge amount of things to see within the frame, especially in exterior scenes where Cleopatra is welcomed in Italy and it is more like a community-sized celebration than a simple welcome. It also takes good writing and execution to keep the audience's attention for just over four hours, and I while I had to watch the two halves on separate days it had my attention until the end.This epic felt like it didn't need to be quite as long as other epics, but it was. In my opinion there could have been more improvement if Cleopatra was given more attention to obviously show she is what the film is all about, so the story lines of Caesar and Antony could have been cut down to give more room for Elizabeth Taylor's leading performance. I shall revisit this film eventually as I plan to revisit all epics I have seen - they are simply amazing films. A dream of mine if I were to become a filmmaker is to try to bring back the epic to the screen for modern audiences whether they can sit for four hours or not.3.5/4.0",Cleopatra
100,mrcaw1,Queen Elizabeth,10,27 April 2004,"Cleopatra (1963) And here comes Richard Burton. Taylor's affair with Burton (while both were married to other folk) during the filming of this epic caused international headlines. Known at the time as THE SCANDAL, it caused the second great fall from grace for Miss Taylor (the first fall came when she married Eddie Fisher and was accused of stealing him from America's sweetheart Debbie Reynolds).One of the costliest flops in the history of movies. Liz received a cool million for the flick though (a record at the time) and by the end of the ordeal had catapulted her fame from simply movie star level to historical icon. The movie? Well it's long and boring but damn, if Taylor don't look good in it!",Cleopatra
101,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,Much better than the critics said,7,15 February 2009,"A $40,000,000 movie (in 1963 dollars) and it looks it. Magnificent sets. The recreations of Rome and Alexandria and the ships in the sea battle are all stunning. The entrance of Cleo into Rome goes on and on for like 20 minutes but it too is dazzling.The story itself is not that interesting as Cleo uses Caesar and then Marc Antony in her attempt at world power. Rex Harrison is great as Caesar. He plays him as a world-weary 52 year old but still very intelligent and clever as well as being a ruthless warrior. Richard Burton is great as Antony and Martin Landau has a big part as his right-hand man Rufio.Elizabeth Taylor is, of course, the star and to me was a disappointment. Taylor is a short women and in a film like this, can't wear heels, and that lack of stature combined with her little girl voice makes her unconvincing as the woman who makes men tremble.One of the great tearjerker endings. We all know about Cleo and the snake but what happens to Antony is even sadder since it's his own fault. I loved the scene near the end where he jumped from his battleship onto the skiff in pursuit of Cleo and then silently fell to his knees. Without saying a word, Burton makes us see that his character Antony now realizes he has just thrown away his entire life.",Cleopatra
102,michaelhirakida,Let Me Explain Myself Better,1,6 July 2014,"OK, when I originally wrote this review some year ago, I really was out of my mind and I didn't know what I was doing so I had to just make a bunch of stupid stuff up. But this time. I am going to have a second chance to explain why I hate this movie so much.Cleopatra.This movie...It nearly destroyed the whole entire film industry.It destroyed careers, it received scathing reviews, it damaged people's reputation, but most importantly, it nearly destroyed 20th Century Fox.Yeah. That's Right. This movie nearly made them bankrupt. Can you think what would happen if we didn't have 20th Century Fox?! We wouldn't have the star wars movies, we wouldn't have The Poseidon Adventure, we wouldn't have Avatar, Predator, Alien, Die Hard, The God's Must Be Crazy, oh... and a personal favorite of mine, BORAT!Also, Animated companies later on would have nowhere to go to if 20th Century Fox wasn't around! Dreamworks and Blue Sky being the top ones.Its hard to explain why I do not like this movie. But i'll try to explain in one go. This movie is the most god awful, overlong (even for an epic), annoying and genre destroying film I have ever seen. It killed the epic and thats why we never ever see an epic film ever again. O.K Look. The way I see an epic film is that it is over three hours long, with an overture, intermission and maybe some exit music with beautiful scenery, involving story, memorable characters, great action if there is any which fits all perfectly into a movie you will be patient to sit through. Cleopatra does not do that. It insults the epic by giving barely any action, no chemistry between Taylor and Burton, overloading on big scenery that looks ugly and being over 5 hours longs. No seriously, this movie is over 5 hours long I mean it I am not lying I fast forwarded through the whole thing it was that bad. Now, Epics are at least 2 - 2- 1/2 hours long and does not have the same effect as classics as Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur do. Everyone involved in this film is all their fault. They destroyed what I loved most and we probably won't see it again. Rarely do we see an epic film such as The Lord Of The Rings films that do give a big effect on you when watching. One day. I will make an epic. Just like the old days. Something that is like Lawrence of Arabia and Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Then everything will be restored. This is a subject I care about lots. I hope you can agree with me on this.11/100 D-",Cleopatra
103,twanurit,Below Par Spectacle/Soap Opera,6,15 May 2001,"This reminds me of Fox's earlier 1954 ""The Egyptian"" which was more entertaining, with better music, more characters, a more humane running time and no bloated budget. Elizabeth Taylor makes a petite, blowsy,  sometimes shrill Queen, with a hammy Rex Harrison as Caesar and hungover Richard Burton unconvincing as warrior Antony. The battle scenes are vague and unfinished with Cleo's entrance into Rome the main highlight. It should have been cut by 90 minutes. The DVD's 2 hour documentary (2000) is better than the film itself. While early screen tests convince that brassy Brit Joan Collins would have made a B-Movie type Cleopatra, Peter Finch and Stephen Boyd looked very promising as Caesar and Antony wannabes. But the lumbering script would have hampered everybody involved.",Cleopatra
104,JPfanatic93,The most excessive epic of them all,7,19 October 2013,"If 'lavish' is the singular term to bestow upon the historical epics of the Fifties and Sixties, Cleopatra exceeds the term in every way, making it clear from the get-go of its four-hour running time this, adjusted for inflation, is definitely one of the most excessive and expensive movies of them all. 20th Century-Fox sure wasn't thrilled by that fact at the time, as it nearly pushed the studio into bankruptcy. Nevertheless, it persisted in the project (since cancellation would have been its death sentence for sure) and today it remains a testament to just how staggeringly detailed and rich a movie can be made to look if enough money is thrown at it. In many ways, Cleopatra is not one, but two movies: director Joseph L. Mankiewicz always intended for it to be released in two parts (a decision the home cinema release has honoured by splitting the movie in half, spread over two discs). The first would have been called Caesar and Cleopatra, its sequel Antony and Cleopatra, as the movie conveniently cuts from one male protagonist to the other around the middle of the film, with the Queen of Egypt the constant that unites them both in a tale of passion, decadence, lust and glory.Grand diva Elizabeth Taylor plays her most iconic role of all as the young queen that finds herself in the middle of the plots and intrigue at the Egyptian court of her brother who means to dispose of her, only to be saved by the older Roman general Caesar (a thoughtful and intelligent, but undeniably ruthless and pragmatic character portrayed by Rex Harrison) who, compelled by her wit and charm, instead forms an alliance with her and gets rid of her treacherous sibling. Said union spawns a son, Caesarion, which gives her an incentive to make a claim on the rule of Rome when his father is murdered in the Senate. Enter his boorish, no-nonsense second-in-command Mark Antony (the notorious Richard Burton) who has his own notions on the matter, but swiftly is suckered into Cleopatra's web of passion too, an affair destined to end in tragedy. Ironically, Taylor and Burton couldn't keep their hands off each other in reality as well, leading to one of the most scandalous and infamous love affairs in Hollywood history that made Brangelina look second rate. Keeping the affair in line as well as could be managed – basically, not at all, thanks to Burton's loudmouth persona – to avoid overly devastating public scrutiny, coupled with the ever rising production problems and outrageous costs (driving a movie originally budgeted at 2 million dollars to a whopping 44 million dollars), drove many a Fox executive close to madness, but over the years Cleopatra made a decent recuperation for the studio and even turned a bit of a profit. Audiences sure got what they payed for: an opulent epic-to-end-all-epics with a scale and scope still unsurpassed, using some of the biggest sets ever created, populated by thousands of extras and a diverse range of wild beasts, all just as background material. And unlike the digitally saturated present day, it was all there in the flesh, making the sets look as spectacularly opulent in real life as they appear on film. Of course the fabulously rich environments where secondary only to Taylor's magnificent performance as the young monarch, at first relying on her sensual beauty and ever underestimated intelligence for her own basic survival, but soon applying both to make her country and herself a top player in Mediterranean politics by going head to head with the might of Rome in a love affair with one of its most powerful men that is bound to destroy an empire, and ultimately herself as tragedy ensues. Taylor definitely dominates each scene and won't allow the bombastic sights to take center stage. She is aided by a grand cast which includes the likes of Roddy McDowall and Martin Landau, only tools for her to play off against as they can't compare with her majesty. Nevertheless, because of the endless show of grandiose sets, sexual plotting and Roman violence it cannot be denied Cleoptra feels like it's dragging on too long, which convinces the audience cutting it into two separate pieces would probably have been for the best. Even so, Cleopatra remains one of the most sensational movies ever produced, its history as wild and epic as the history that inspired it.",Cleopatra

The sets and numbers of extras used are huge, and the movie carries a 4hr run time, so settle in!The lead trio are portrayed by; Richard Burton, Rex Harrison and Elizabeth Taylor. They all put in very strong performances. Burton as always is very passionate, Harrison is excellent as a slightly arrogant but tired statesman and legend, but it is Taylor that is the stand out for me! She is utterly committed to the role and outshines both veteran and award winning male actors.The movie doesn't set the world alight but it is of high quality, and whilst areas such as dialogue are typical of the period when the film was made, the film will stand the test of time because of the sheer scale, bombast and rich imagery that comes with it.Perfect sort of film for a relaxing Sunday afternoon...",Cleopatra
106,jaredpahl,Epic of Epics. Spectacle of Spectacles.,9,1 July 2021,"Why do we watch movies? That will always depend on the person and on the movie. But why, really? It's something I have thought of. The real point of going to the movies. To explore ideas? To empathize with others? To simply be entertained? I have my answer. I watch movies in pursuit of the excitement, the unmatchable thrill, that comes from immersing myself in worlds I will never visit, and living vicariously through people I will never be. An experience like that of Joseph L. Mankiewicz' Cleopatra, one that comes around once in ten thousand movies, is what I'm always chasing.I write in grandiose terms because this film warrants big language. Chances are, you've heard the dramatic back-stage stories; of clashes, lovers, and mountains of money burned to make Cleopatra happen. I'm sick of it. Because lost in all the talk of studio bankruptcy and movie flopping is a major historical epic. Cleopatra comes from the Golden Age (yes, the Golden Age. Not the ""end"") of the cinematic epic. The 1960s were the decade in which the Sunday school Cinemascope pictures grew up. The 60s gave us epics with grander ideas, more confident filmmaking, and a giant leap in that all important element: immersion.The canvas is immense. Three political demigods of the antique world, charismatic Roman would-be emperor Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison), his general Mark Antony (Richard Burton), and the woman who would lead to the downfall of them both, the Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor). Empires lie in the balance. Those fascinated by ancient history will no doubt be fascinated by Cleopatra's storyline. Based on thousands-of-years-old histories by Plutarch, Suetonius, and Appian, Cleopatra traces one of civilizations most dramatic stories. A politically charged love triangle-cum-power struggle which inspired two Shakespeare plays; plays whose best moments are brilliantly infused among the four hours of pageantry, battles, and high melodrama.The first half of the film highlights Julius Caesar's hiatus in Egypt, his relationship with the young queen, and his aspirations of conquest. Aspirations shared by Cleopatra in one of the dozens of indelible sequences in the film, a plea for joint domination of the world at the tomb of Alexander the Great. The scene captivated me. Because it immersed me. Because, for a moment, I believed that I was really looking at the body of Alexander the Great; that I was privy to the actual Julius Caesar and Cleopatra's private thoughts. That sort of conjured electricity colors the best moments of Cleopatra. It's helped along, of course, by Rex Harrison. He gives the best performance of the film. So gallant, charming, erudite, and vulnerable, that I was rooting for the second half's doomed lovers simply because of their connection to him.That post-intermission shift is more discordant than most, but that is only because Act I ends on an all-time great, goosebumps-inducing, stone cold stunner of a sequence. You may guess what the scene entails, but even so, it (and the proceeding ending) knocked me out emotionally. After that, the film has to almost completely reset, and it takes a while before the emotional heat is turned up so high again. But it does get there, in a scorching series of finales. Burton is a fiery Antony, better than he gets credit for. Roddy McDowell plays Octavian, a son-of-a-gun of a villain if ever there was one. And at the center of it all is Taylor as Cleopatra. She is a strong anchor, selling a years-long descent from ambitious young woman to a defeated, distraught queen. The biggest compliment I can give is that I understood her appeal to these men. Elizabeth Taylor isn't super-model sculpted, but the way she carries herself, in a confident, lilting, lovestruck way, is more sexy than any romantic lead has the right to be. Wowza.Stories don't get much bigger, and Cleopatra employs a production to match. We open on a shot of thousands of Roman soldiers. A widescreen tableau ten miles deep. It's sumptuous. And Cleopatra is four hours of such exquisite grandeur. Be it the huge, detailed palace interiors, the few thunderous battles, the pageants, or just the basic establishing shots, Mankiewincz understands that standing back and letting the production and art direction do the work themselves, is what makes us feel ""there"". Those that dismiss the scale of this movie and movies like it as ""overblown"" or ""bloated"", completely discredit their immersive impact. It's not just about being wowed by spectacle, though wowed I was by Cleopatra. With film artists working this hard to create fully realized worlds, this film capitalizes on the promise of the movies. I spent an afternoon basked in an ancient world. The assertion that this, or any movie, would be better at a more modest scale is, frankly, ridiculous. The movie sunk its claws into me because of its enormity. Because there are so few movies that wow like this movie wows. So few movies that suck you in past the edges of the screen and hold you somewhere else. It does all this as it layers substance on top. Cleopatra is more than a parade of cinematic beauty shots. It submerges us in a fascinating period. A time when the whims of a few individuals could foment until they overflowed into world wars.Cleopatra is the type of experience you (heartbreakingly) cannot get anywhere but the handful of great epic movies made half a dozen decades ago. It's a treasure. More valuable to me than a thousand ""better"" movies. They don't make these movies anymore. This experience, of settling in for a roadshow presentation of an amazing journey, is for all intents and purposes, extinct. That is a shattering shame. Like the young Egyptian queen did to Caesar for burning Alexandria's great library, I shame those that failed to appreciate this treasure. It's gone now, and it's your fault.89/100.",Cleopatra

108,stumpmee77,I totally sit on the fence on this film.,5,4 January 2005,"Liked some of the costumes (particularly the first suit Liz appears in and her 30 lb. golden dress), some however should be pitched--especially that thing she wore when she was bidding her tutor to go to Rome (Look at that junk--what ancient Egyptian would have been wearing a 1961 lounge dress and feathered turban?).Felt the growing friction between Rome and Egypt went at a good pace in Part II/Felt the earlier family friction between Cleo and her bro far too hokey and rushed in Part I.Liked and disliked Liz's performance by this fashion. If she was with Rex Harrison she was good--The scene where she's stating what her goals are for the future of Rome and Egypt had me riveted. But when she was with Richard Burton--except for Anthony's death scene and the scene where they're talking after making out--she sucked. Bad. Real, real bad. And when she by herself depending on the main male costar at the time, she's good/bad (the scene knifing of Anthony's Clothes is just too over the top).Loved the Cinematography and sets--The bulk of the dialog however left much to be desired and cover my face at some of the ways it was delivered (Richard Burton especially). Rex Harrison was ultra good--you believe he's a great, but tired leader and his love for his ambition and with it Cleopatra follows a logical progression that's exciting to watch---Richard Burton--For me, Richard Burton, not Liz who's the actor who is this film's cancer for lack of better word. He is unbearable to watch and should have been restrained--Oh why does Liz try to contract his sickness by becoming screechy and annoying too?",Cleopatra
109,no-skyline,A Film Of Two Halves,7,2 November 2005,"First of please note this is a review of the recent restored DVD version of the film not the savagely cut older version of the film.Having watched the documentary on this film it seems amazing this film was ever completed how the director managed to get anything even vaguely coherent to the screen is a minor miracle in itself. Cleopatra is a luscious period epic and it's clear no expense was spared on either scenery or costumes, gorgeous to look at but somehow unsatisfying at the end. The movie seems to lose it's way half way through as Rex Harrison departs so for me does the quality of this movie.It's difficult to tell whether this is due to over the top performances from Taylor and Burton or the forced cuts to reduce the running time. Roddy McDowell is the highlight of the 2nd half of the film and i'm sure Joaquin Phoenix must have researched his role for Gladiator here, McDowell's Octavian is chilling in the extreme. But the rest of the 2nd half of the movie descends into melodrama, where the 1st gave us the excellent Harrison restrained and regal as Ceaser the 2nd gives us real life lovers Burton and Taylor locked in an over-acted doomed romance. But throughout the film there are supporting actors giving first class performances that without the cuts would be interesting to see Martin Landau, Andrew Keir, Hume Cronyn and George Cole all have their moments it's just a shame there aren't more of them.If I could split my vote over the two halves of the movie the first half would get 9/10 the 2nd 6/10 as I can't I'm going with a 7/10 overall.",Cleopatra

Rex Harrison and Richard Burton were okay as Caeser and Anthony, respectively, but Elizabeth Taylor gave an incredibly lifeless portrayal of Cleopatra. She was probably up every night with Richard and was too tired in the mornings to put any energy or sex appeal into her performance.

The acting is splendid, the casting is good, the scenics and atmospheres are terrific. That's not to say the film does not have its flaws...indeed it does. But these are overcome by the intensity and passion of the performers as well as the subject matter. Due to its length and its budget, it broke the bank at 20th Century Fox in its day. It also was not a critical success at that time...but the resurgence of the film in this era of re-visitation finds this film to be head and shoulders above nearly any other attempt. Burton had many fine performances, both before and after this, but kudos to Liz Taylor in perhaps her most significant screen role...as well as to Roddy McDowell who, surprisingly, turns in one of his best performances as Octavius. The film should have made stars of Martin Landau and Carroll O'Conner, but fame was still somewhat down the road for them in the medium of television.

Given the immense resources at hand, it is not only the opulence, magnificence, grandeur and the awe inspiring spectacle that matters, but the subtle and moving depiction of feelings and events that usually reverberate an audience's soul.To be precise, this movie would have been a super mega hit, had it been directed by William Wyler. Wyler knew how to get the best out of Heston while filming Ben-Hur and he must have tamed and perfected Burton (by exercising retakes) to act appropriately, purposefully and out of his heart and soul to extend proper exposure and magnitude to his pivotal role in Cleopatra. Taylor with so many costly and pompous costumes did not effectively succeed to get under the skin of her imperial character.There could had been a lot of improvement in the cinematography and direction that would had lent a significant boost and thrill to this over budgeted movie.

118,mfisher452,The trouble with Cleo,4,27 January 2002,"A (female) friend of mine who (regretfully, unlike me) has visited Greece said that she realized why ancient Greek men idealized both female beauty and male homosexuality: ""Because Greek women are the ugliest women I've ever seen,"" she said. If she was right, there are obviously lots of exceptions to this rule in the entertainment world (and all over the Internet on some rather naughty websites). Cleopatra VII, the last Queen of Egypt, was actually Greek; she was a Ptolemy; and the historical evidence is that although she may have been brilliant and talented, she was not beautiful. So naturally she was played by the very beautiful French-born Claudette Colbert in 1934 and the English-born Elizabeth Taylor in 1963. Taylor, who was 30 when she made Cleopatra, was actually about the same age as the real Cleopatra when the events of the film transpired but already past the peak of her beauty (watch Ivanhoe, made 11 years earlier).The AMC channel produced an excellent 2-hour documentary of the vagaries of production of this film, its wretched excesses, and the fact that the film was cut very heavily for its final release. Apparently a worldwide restoration effort is under way in order to try to restore this film to something like its original form, although according to the documentary, there was never a consistent unified concept for this epic. True, many scenes are spectacular and likely never to be excelled, even with modern digital imaging techniques (compare the recent film Gladiator), but no treatment of this film I have seen has ever really gotten hold of the reason this film will never be counted among the classics of film history: And that is Elizabeth Taylor's utter, absolute, complete failure to convince the viewer, for even one single second of screen time, that she is Cleopatra. Not for a moment do you believe that she is really the fabled queen of Egypt who courted Imperial Rome and almost had her way with them. Everything about Taylor's performance---her bland looks, her flat American accent, her mannerisms, her technique, her totally uninvolving screen persona---is a ludicrous caricature of a fascinating historical figure.",Cleopatra

True, it did plague 20th Century Fox to the point of near bankruptcy (until ""The Sound of Music"" saved it in 1965) and Elizabeth Taylor's health overshadowed the film schedule but there are more good things about the film than there are bad, the backlashing of the film has just blown itself all out of proportion. Richard Burton and Elizabeth's much-publicized offscreen love affair grew to such a feverishly fiery degree that it made their onscreen relationship as Antony and Cleopatra all the more genuine. Rex Harrison as Caesar is first-rate as well and yet he was the only one out of the entire cast that received an Oscar nomination (Richard Burton was one who should have been in the running as well... his performance is equal to his earlier work in ""The Robe"" and later in ""Becket"" and ""Anne of the Thousand Days""). Miss Taylor is very commanding in the role of her career and as a result few remember Claudette Colbert's earlier turn as Egypt's most memorable ruler in Cecil B. De Mille's 1934 version.

He was at the time a cranky old sod working by the old rule book of lighting. I love the original Planet of the Apes, which Shamroy also shot, except for the over lit sets, which make them look like sets. 
 It is a shame that the director was not allowed to make it into 2 separate films instead of the butchered version that now exists with thousands of feet of film missing. This is a prime example of a film actually being harmed because of the marketing department wanting to get the film out with all of Burton's scenes before he and Liz split and the audience's appetite for their torrid love affair wanes.

Only the even longer ""The Ten Commandments"" might dare to challenge it as the most impressive of this group of films. The casting of most of the principle characters was perfect: Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra, Rex Harrison as Caesar, Richard Burton as Mark Antony, and, Elizabeth's friend from their early film careers, Roddy McDowell, as the ultimate victor: Octavian(Caesar Augustus). Incidentally, for the enlightenment of the reviewer immediately following this one, all 4 of the principle actors were born in the UK, hence their 'fake' British accents! Interestingly, 'Rex' means 'king' in Latin(think T. Rex), and for that reason was chosen by Harrison to replace his birth name, undoubtedly guessing that ,some day, he would play Caesar! From the point of view of theater audiences, I maintain that, at 3hr, 17 min., for a screenplay of such 'heavy' material, it tried to accomplish too much in one film. It should have been divided into 2 films: ""Cleopatra and Caesar""(the first half of the film), followed by ""Cleopatra and Mark Antony"", using the same main actors. In fact, this is what director Joseph Mankiewicz fervently wanted. But Fox refused to invest this much money in 2 clearly very expensive films. Since they didn't turn a profit on this film for many years, we can now see their concern. Of course, today we have technologies where you can watch however much you want at a sitting, but I watched it on TV, where you still have to watch it at one sitting, unless you record it...........As Caesar, the very theatrical Rex Harrison dominates the first half. The equally theatrical Richard Burton and Elizabeth codominate the second half. I most enjoyed the segments in which Caesar and Cleopatra, and later Antony and Cleopatra, are sizing each other up. Also, Elizabeth pulling a fast one on Roddy, agreeing to accompany him to Rome if he promised not to put her on public display as the defeated Egyptian queen, then secretly committing suicide, clearly not trusting Roddy's promise.",Cleopatra

So that weeks later, when the cut version hit the bulk of the theaters, audiences and local reviewers found the action, especially in the second half, hard to follow. Thus the movie's reputation as a ""failure"" began. Thankfully, a restoration on DVD became available (was it around 20 years ago?) and we now have this great film available again. We can see why it was originally conceived as two separate films, because the conclusion of the first half has all the resonance of an ending, and is completely satisfying on its own. Just a few years ago, the Cinemark movie chain showed the restoration on their screen in our town - and it was a revelation.
One was struck at once by the ease and authority Elizabeth Taylor projects throughout this long film. Has any actress ever been given a role of this size and scope before or since? Decades before computer-generated special effects, the events are alive with the sounds and colorful effects we took for granted in the sixties from Hollywood - though most of this was shot in Europe.
I think all of the DVD versions contain an equally excellent documentary on the ""making of"" this movie. It is perhaps one of the finest such glimpses into studio-based film making available. Anyone interested in Hollywood history will be sure to enjoy it. Truly, they don't make them like this any more!",Cleopatra
124,kirksworks,1963 may be just as ancient as Ancient Rome,9,1 September 2012,"For those who like historical epics, you will find much greatness within this film, even though it wasn't completed as originally intended by Mankiewicz. It remains one of the most expensive movies ever made, and looks it. Everything was built full scale, and often shot on real locations. A flawed masterpiece is what it is. Though I love Elizabeth Taylor, and she is wonderful in many ways here, particularly in the love scenes, when she's assuming the role of queen I think some of her subtlety gets lost. This is most evident in scenes where she expresses anger in the same demanding manner. On the other hand, she is perfectly fine when she's just acting as a woman or a mother. A good example is when she notices her son's ring on the hand of Octavian, which she understands to mean her son is dead. Her reaction, shown in the eyes, is brief, but deftly communicates her thought process. That is the moment she realizes she must end her own life. She is very moving, getting the most out of very little. It was the kind of subtle gesture few actors could do as well.Her love scenes with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison), are filled with longing for the future and passion for the moment. They are mostly superior to her love scenes with Antony (Richard Burton). However, she is exquisite in the climax as Antony dies in her arms. Taylor's death scene is also beautifully done, her final line, ""Antony Antony wait"" delivered with elegant simplicity. Much of what makes the film work are its visuals and to Taylor's credit, she never gets lost in the pageantry. Her costumes are just as spectacular as it gets. THe gown of gold she wears entering Rome is particularly stunning. As for the visuals, they are mind-boggling, but the interiors are often let down by the lighting. The night sequences, and especially the final sequence as Cleopatra prepares for death, however, are suitably dark and torch lit, very atmospheric, but day scenes, like the many bath scenes, are lit like a 1960s TV sit com. Where would all that light be coming from? This is ancient Egypt!! Believable lighting for the ancient world didn't really improve for decades. When Ridley Scott made ""Gladiator"" he understood how dark ancient interiors needed to be. What ""Cleopatra"" has all over ""Gladiator,"" however, is authenticity of crowds, and no digital fakery. There are two spectacular set pieces that continue to amaze, the first Cleopatra's entry into Rome, and the second, the arrival of her barge. Both occur in bright daylight, properly so. We need to see everything clearly to understand the vast scale. There is a shot of hundreds of slaves pulling a massive Egyptian sphinx that Queen Cleo and her son are perched upon. The slaves step in time to Alex North's beautifully ornate entry march. In one impressive shot from Cleo's point of view we look down on the men swaying back and forth as they tug the heavy odalisque through a large city gate. The crowd of Roman onlookers is entranced as the sphinx moves slowly towards the awaiting Caesar and his assembly. As you watch this sequence you begin to realize that what you are seeing is something no different than ancient Rome itself.The same said about the arrival of Cleopatra's barge. In this digital age, massive space craft and spectacular vistas are commonplace, but this barge was the real thing. It may pale in comparison to what digital effects can do, but when viewed on the big screen, you can realize what a different time it was. Things were real. Crowds were real. And ""Cleopatra"" is perhaps the best example of this extravagance. The film is a testament to another age of cinema.Direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is intelligent and forward moving, often accompanied with witty dialog. Many smaller roles are superbly played, Roddy McDowell's Octavian being a standout. And though it's common to tear down Burton's performance, he is perfectly fine as Antony. The problem, however, is the character Antony itself. He's a weak man, and he not only gives up all for his love of Cleopatra, but even battles against his own people. He's somewhat of a fool and he doesn't garner a lot of sympathy. Unlike ""Ben-Hur"" with the spurned Messala battling Judah in a chariot race, or dictator Crassus battling the slave revolt in ""Spartacus,"" in ""Cleopatra"" there really isn't any villain. We only have the frailty of human emotion. This may be more complex, but doesn't pull us through the story as emotionally. ""Cleopatra"" is basically two love stories. One ends with an assassination and the other with suicide. Not a happy ending. Still, tragedies are often more compelling than films with happy endings. So, as long as you know what you're getting yourself in for, a four hour movie with some depth and spectacle delivered at a moderate pace, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Mankiewicz got his original two-part, 6 hour film (""Caesar and Cleopatra"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra"") cut down by two hours to become a single film. That the story still plays as well as it does says much about the quality of the extant material. In spite of its weaknesses, ""Cleopatra"" does hold up. Viewers with patience will find the experience rewarding.",Cleopatra
125,moatazmohsen78,the best copy of Cleopatra,10,15 November 2005,"That,s best copy of Cleopatra in the level of another copies in many points (act,script,directed,music....etc).

126,steve.schonberger,A triumph of set design over story-telling.,6,17 December 2000,"The good news about Cleopatra is that the sets were spectacular. Maybe Rome and Alexandria didn't look that way, but the sets do a great job of suggesting the magnificence of the capital an empire and the capital of its richest subject kingdom. Maybe the triumphal arch hadn't been built in Cleopatra's time, but it makes a great setting for her grand entrance into Rome.The costumes were impressive too, even if they more closely resemble early 1960s fashion than the 40s and 30s B.C. Elizabeth Taylor's huge wardrobe was the highlight, but most of the costumes were interesting.Unfortunately, great sets and costumes don't make a great movie, although they do show how the movie became the most expensive movie ever (which it remains, adjusting for inflation). The movie just doesn't remain interesting through its entire four hours. Even some of the battle scenes are dull, even though that's usually a highlight of ancient-world movies. (There are some good battle scenes too, however.) The problem is that the movie lacks focus in trying to tell a story. Sometimes it's a historical drama, sometimes it's a romance story, and sometimes it's just a showpiece for the great sets. Five writing credits are listed, and it certainly looks like a committee wrote it.The Cleopatra-Caesar is the better portion of the movie. Caesar is an interesting character, aware of his mortality, seeking power in spite of the burden of power, and attracted to the much-younger Cleopatra. Cleopatra wanted to rule the world, and sought it in the bedroom as well as in the throne room and on the battlefield. The historic Cleopatra's allure was said to be in her voice and her words, not her appearance; with Caesar the movie often suggests her charisma, while Taylor's beauty is a very agreeable divergence from history. Had the movie raced through the events after Caesar's death, it would have been much shorter and better.Unfortunately, the movie really drags during the Cleopatra-Antony portion, except in scenes with the delightfully unpleasant Octavian. Antony seems little more than a sucker for Cleopatra's charms, rather than a general and politician who was shrewd enough to make himself one of three co-rulers of Rome, but not shrewd enough to avoid his eventual fate as Octavian's rival. Cleopatra's goals are no longer clear, but wind down from her earlier ambition to rule the world to her scaled-down hopes to retain rule of Egypt for herself and her son. Rather than dramatizing the events, it just uses them as bridges between scenes of spectacle.With so much time to tell about Cleopatra and Antony, the movie should have been able to show more about the characters. Cleopatra makes the blunder of seducing the number-two man in a Triumvirate that couldn't last long before the number-one man seized sole power. The movie fails to tell us how someone so astute would make the mistake of choosing the wrong ally, or standing aside until she could ally with the winner. Was Antony the one who seemed likely to prevail at the time she committed herself? Did she feel the need to take a side before a victor could be predicted, and fail to charm Octavian? Or did she choose badly because she was romantically smitten with Antony? She might hide the reason from Antony, but the movie shouldn't hide the reason from viewers. The characters need motives to be interesting.The most interesting character in the Cleopatra-Antony part of the movie is Octavian. He is a much more interesting character, and the movie shows us more about him than the leads, even though he gets much less screen time.The Cleopatra-Caesar part of the movie is pretty good, and the spectacle is impressive throughout, but the story gets lost in the Cleopatra-Antony part. Maybe the writers got bored after Caesar's death; I certainly got bored after that.",Cleopatra
127,n_r_koch,Cleo Deco,5,20 May 2009,"It's always hard to know what might have been, but it's hard to believe that what got cut was two hours of exciting action sequences. In 1949 Zanuck had made Mankiewicz's A LETTER TO THREE WIVES workable by cutting (Mank wanted four wives, which, what with the adulteress in there, was probably two too many but it was the '40s when everything came in threes because there were three social classes and all the social scientists had three names). Mank's style is so uncinematic that you wonder if it was meant as a jab at Hollywood, which he never liked. He shoots in the style of the Early Silents, before the introduction of magic like cutting on movement and combining shots into scenes. Everyone in this one seems to be nailed to the floor, too. Maybe the trouble was all those uppity Italian extras. Harrison makes a good Caesar, Macdowell is over-the-top in a fun way as Octavian (how else could he have played it? he looks like Caesar's ""boy""), and Burton is unexpectedly off form. Taylor plays the Queen of the Nile like a girl who will stop at nothing to become prom queen.What Mankiewicz was apparently trying to do was to make a sort of flattened modern version of what Shakespeare and Shaw handled ornately. So the movie is a reasonably smart but rather plodding and uncinematic filmed Rome play shot in the style of a perfume ad. You feel it's really dying to be a musical (I kept waiting for Burton to burst into a love song). A lot of the sets looked suspiciously like the ones in the film version of THE KING AND I. But they are entertaining. Thanks to the army of designers and Leon Shamroy, this movie is worth seeing once. If a movie looks this good it can be chopped up and static and still be watchable.",Cleopatra
128,uroshnor54,Very Entertaining,10,21 July 2014,"I don't know much about filmmaking, but Cleopatra probably isn't an excellent movie when it comes to artistic achievement. But it is very entertaining. I was amazed that a movie that was 245 minutes long (that was the length of the version I watched (I think it said 245 on the DVD case but it might have been 248, I forget) but I hear the movie was cut down to 3.5 hours for its first American release and that the director originally wanted to have the film cut into two movies that would have been 3 hours each) kept my attention for that long. There really wasn't one boring minute in the entire movie. I've watched shorter movies that were much more boring. La Dolce Vita is a little less than 3 hours long but I was bored by it less than a half-hour in.I've often tried to watch all of The Ten Commandments (the Charlton Heston version) and I only succeeded once because it's a pretty boring movie (don't get me wrong, though I'm not a Christian I have nothing but respect for the Bible, but seriously, it's a boring movie). And The Ten Commandments is about a half-hour shorter.The only other movie in the same genre that I liked as much Cleopatra is Ben-Hur. I thought for a long time about which one I thought I liked more. On the one hand, Ben-Hur has a totally awesome chariot race and a great revenge story that was partly inspired by The Count of Monte Cristo (one of my favorite books (I haven't read General Lew Wallace's Ben-Hur, though)). But on the other hand, Cleopatra does have Elizabeth Taylor. Both get pretty corny at times but Cleopatra is definitely the more corny (but I love the corniness of these sword-and-sandal epics and I really don't mean it as an insult). They have equally impressive sets and equally dated sea battle scenes. Actually I'd say Cleopatra has the edge when it comes to sets because of Cleopatra's ship. They both have good scores but I liked Miklós Rózsa's score for Ben-Hur a bit more than Alex North's for Cleopatra. I'd say both Ben-Hur and Cleopatra are very entertaining movies but I liked Cleopatra just a little bit more. Then again, I just watched Cleopatra yesterday and the last time I saw Ben-Hur was a few months ago. To fairly say which one I liked more, I'd probably have to watch them back to back.But if we're talking about which one is artistically superior and not which one I personally liked more, I guess Ben-Hur would come out on top (Ben-Hur did win 7 more Academy Awards than Cleopatra, after all). Actually, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus probably would but I'll admit I didn't enjoy that movie as much as either Ben-Hur or Cleopatra.",Cleopatra
129,SixtusXLIV,"Why the Movie ""Cleopatra"" is a failure",5,21 May 2005,"History is made of truth, and it's made of myth. In his play ""Julius Caesar"" Shakespeare quotes ""Mark Anthony"" : ""Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their Bones""So, let it be with Joseph Leo Mankiewicz. . This man has made too many great films, that I almost feel guilty writing this.He wrote many of the screenplays for his movies, and Cleopatra is no exception. But in this he was ""helped"" by a certain Carlo M. Franzero. This man is not credited in the DVD that I have. (English/European PAL version). I don't know the text Mr. Franzero wrote, but the dialog spoken in the movie is, in my opinion, the primary reason that makes this movie historically unacceptable.Whether Plutarch tells us the truth, and Shakespeare follows Plutarch almost to the letter, we shall never know But Shakespeare imprinted onto the English language the Roman ""Gravitas"" of speech, which the learned Romans inherited from the Greek philosophers and writers, mainly the great tragedians. It is the main reason this movie is not credible. Compare it with Spartacus. The young Stanley Kubrick left the writing of the screenplay to professionals, the acting to the best talent of the London stage..Mankiewicz, because he had done ""Julius Caesar"" 10 years before played ""Jack of all Trades"". He also put his talents at service to the vanity of Elisabeth Taylor (an Americanized Englishwoman without English accent) and Richard Burton (a Welshman with bad accent). Rex Harrison is a comedy actor, he was miscast, but he tries very hard to make Julius Caesar credible.Hollywood, has, in general butchered Old Rome's history. It took sides with the Jews or the Christians, both not Romans. Here it does not, but it is not credible. Go see Spartacus (in the Criterion collection DVD, if you have that, and you should)",Cleopatra
130,guanche,Tries too hard and comes up zero.,4,16 July 2007,"A real tease that doesn't deliver. Just like the probable real life Cleopatra to any man without an empire to offer. The beautiful and realistic sets and costumes never go beyond a soap opera display. While some of the supporting actors (particularly Rex Harrison as Caesar) do a credible job, Richard Burton is a rather wooden Marc Anthony and Elizabeth Taylor is terrible. She seems more like a spoiled sixties era suburban brat than a ruthless but skilled queen accustomed to wielding power.I always thought that Marie Windsor; although 10 years older than Taylor; would have been perfect for this role and might have rescued the film. Her age would even have been closer to the real Cleopatra's by the time she and Marc Anthony became joint rulers. I couldn't help giggling when people acted frightened of Queen Liz. She reminded me of a bossy older sister, whereas Queen Marie really would have made the audience shudder if she was angry. I could never understand why Windsor was relegated to B movies, but that's a subject of it's own.The lack of good battle scenes was also disappointing. A real waste when you think of all the extras and money spent on authentic looking arms and armor. The vaunted sea battle was pretty ho-hum, not nearly as good as the one in Ben Hur. I actually enjoyed the overly melodramatic and less historically accurate 1934 ""Cleopatra"" much more. Some of the sexual metaphors; both verbal and visual; were really funny, and it was much more entertaining. Lots of glitz and even some true dazzle. But not much substance, and pretty tedious for four freakin' hours. It didn't have to be this way. What a shame!",Cleopatra
131,ga-bsi,Poetic,9,14 April 2009,"Although this film is condemned by many, I find that it is far more poetic than the 1999 version. It is a grand and dramatic adaptation of Cleopatra's somewhat tragic life. Elizabeth Taylor is beautiful and seductive as the last Egyptian Pharoah, even with her excessive amount of eye make up. Rex Harrison is, as always, outstanding and speaks the very poetic dialogue as if he is voicing his own thoughts. Richard Burton is brilliant as the tragic Roman General who lives in Julius Caeser's shadow, and is slowly destroyed by the demanding love of Cleopatra. Roddy McDowell is awesomely captivating as the ambitious and extraordinarily intelligent Octavian who single handedly brings about the dethroning of Cleopatra and the death of her son, Caeserian, her and lover, Marc Antony. The film is VERY long and anyone who could not sit through a film of medium length must not attempt this movie. The costumes and sets of this movie are masterful, creating a very colourful ancient world.",Cleopatra
132,Penfold-13,Two movies - one good one bad,6,20 August 1999,"And here we see why sequels are usually a very bad idea.First there was a great movie, Caesar & Cleopatra.Elizabeth Taylor plays the young queen Cleopatra. She is inexperienced in politics, but is a fast learner, and well used to deploying her sexual talents in pursuit of her aims. Rex Harrison is Julius Caesar, 52 years old, a brilliant military strategist and tactician, a skilled politician, probably the most powerful man in the world.The young, seductive queen captivates the senior statesman, which causes his downfall, as he mislays his sense and judgement to defy the idea of Rome. A disaster for Cleopatra, who may have set out to conquer him for political purposes, but falls in love with him.Harrison and Taylor do a great job on the May-December relationship, and the dialog crackles with electricity as they jockey for position.The sets are sumptuous, especially Cleopatra's triumphal entry to Rome, and the classical tragedy unfolds in splendid surroundings.The philosophy behind most sequels is basically ""Let's do the same story again, and jazz it up a bit"". So they did, making Antony and Cleopatra.One of the minor characters from the first movie, Mark Antony, played in an exceptionally ham-fisted way even by his standards by Richard Burton, is shoe-horned into the role of powerful Roman seduced by sultry Egyptian Queen, played again by Elizabeth Taylor, this time delivering a performance as stupidly over the top as she was understated and sharp in the original flick. This time round, there's a spectacular royal ship instead of the giant sphinx, and you get Roddy McDowall as a fairly unbelievable Caesar Octavian, but mostly they just plod through the same plot, this time with added shouting and histrionics. Burton and Taylor at their silliest worst.It looks as though the two movies were shot one after the other on the same lot, presumably to save on the costs a bit. The producers must have realised on seeing the cut of the second movie that it was a total turkey, and decided to cut their losses by running the two movies together and showing them as one, which is how we come to have this four hour monstrosity.Watch the first half, which is a great movie, and then find something interesting to do during the second half, like waxing your ears.",Cleopatra

The progression of his acting is incredible. The dialogues, are superb and this romance that is, on paper, of course, an alliance, turns out to be a true romance that will be the fall of Anthony and Cleopatra. And the stage, decors, costumes, are stunning ! It gives respect to a brilliant civilization, and to the most famous political figures in History. It's very cheap to call Taylor "" a costume figuration"" - what about her acting ? Yes, no kidding, a queen dresses classy. Would you find it logical if it were the other way around ?

135,Caledonia Twin #1,Cinematic gold!,10,5 September 2000,"This film is worth watching for the excellent cast of talented actors alone, but Richard Burton truly shines as Mark Antony.  Richard Burton was in 1963 what Anthony Hopkins is to the cinema today, a remarkably talented actor with a resonant voice and a larger than life presence, strong enough to entirely captivate an audience.  Antony's struggle to break free of the shadow of almighty Caesar and his struggle against the beguiling wiles of Cleopatra are fascinating to watch.  The always brilliant Rex Harrison seems, however, a bit peevish for Caesar.  Nevertheless, this movie is a masterpiece of cinematography and the chemistry between Burton and Taylor is riveting.  Roddy McDowell is well-cast as the bookish Octavian.  The spectacle of Cleopatra is only matched by such films as the recent Ridley Scott's Gladiator, Ben-hur, and Kubrick's Spartacus.

136,votarus4,TAYLOR LIGHTS A BONFIRE CALLED `THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION',8,10 June 2003,"Film in the 1960s circled around various social, political and historical themes.  My favorite is `Women Who Altered the Course of History.'  On the always unsafe British throne we saw Eleanor of Aquitaine (The Lion in Winter), Anne Boleyn (Anne of the Thousand Days), and Elizabeth I duking it out with her arch enemy (Mary, Queen of Scots).  Long before them, however, on the world's stage, we have the redoubtable Cleopatra of Egypt, making the power grab of all time.  We have also Elizabeth Taylor of Hollywood, making the power grab of all time.  A product of the ancient MGM regime, Taylor has since acknowledged her bitter personal dealings with studio boss L.B. Mayer. Thus, when 20th Century Fox offered Mike Todd's widow the role of Cleopatra, she had certain contractual demands:  a record-breaking million dollar salary, expense accounts for herself and new husband, Eddie Fisher, $10,000 per day for any work past contract termination, and, if anyone doubts Taylor's business acumen, the film was to be shot in Todd-AO, the cameras and film process of which she was sole owner.  Her final take was in excess of $7 million.  The resultant film, looking backwards 40 years, is still lively, never boring, and surprisingly accurate.  There is respect for the historical record (Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra also time-compresses, as does Shaw's Ceasar and Cleopatra).  But Joseph Mankiewicz's `modern-speaking' script unwisely bites off more than it can chew.  It wants to tell the whole story of Rome and Egypt during a power struggle that altered the course of Western Civilization.  We live today in Augustus Ceasar's world, not Cleopatra's.  Architecture, government, bureaucratic structure, even plumbing, all descend from Rome and the edicts of Octavian, who later became Augustus.  Hollywood on the other hand, and to a great extent `the modern woman,' live in the world Elizabeth Taylor created.  Hollywood has had its share of powerful women  Garbo and Hepburn both successfully trumped Louis B. Mayer while negotiating contracts.  But Taylor negotiated Cleopatra acting as her very own corporate mogul, and the star system, and how movie stars get paid, changed forever.  But something else, something more important, happened while filming Cleopatra:  the twice-divorced, recently-widowed Taylor had just married Eddie Fisher, father of two, husband of another much-adored movie star, Debbie Reynolds. Richard Burton (Marc Antony) entered the scene, replacing Steven Boyd, and Taylor fell deeply in love.  A media storm ignited, and the entire planet watched, as Taylor was condemned by the Catholic Church; the Pope himself called her a wanton home-wrecker.  Following her heart, the most famous actress in history decided to conduct life `her way.'  Ten thousand Roman extras fill the set as Cleopatra makes her way atop a giant, rolling sphinx. They scream `Liz! Liz! Liz!'  Taylor, dressed as a gold-clad Roman eagle, calmly walks towards Rex Harrison's Julius Ceasar and gives him a wink. Hollywood, the star system, the media, and women, are altered forever.",Cleopatra

The first half with Rex Harrison is definitely superior to the second half. Critics seem to prefer the Claudette Colbert version. I know of no area in which it compares with the Elizabeth Taylor version. Aside from the technical production, the acting and the writing in the Taylor version are far better.

Why on earth would they make this movie so long? Also, considering the overblown budget at the time why do most of the sets look cheap like a high school musical?The acting is extremely wooden which makes me believe that perhaps the director and actors didn't really care and were just there for the pay cheque.If you want to see a truly beautiful and well told version of this story then watch the HBO series 'Rome'.

139,elmerflp,"This film defines the term ""dog's breakfast.""",2,27 August 2011,"As we all know, Hollywood has produced some extremely expensive bombs, but, in my humble opinion, this one remains in a class all its own. While it is certainly possible to spend millions of dollars, create humongous, ornate sets, and fill those sets with thousands of extras, the sheer immensity and complexity of the result does not automatically equal great art. Bigger is not always better. In fact, as in the case of this movie, it makes for a more spectacular failure. Perhaps the best way to explain the failure of Cleopatra is to contrast it with another Hollywood epic, Ben-Hur. In the latter film, there is a sublime scene where Ben-Hur is being whipped by a Roman guard on a forced slave march. Ben-Hur falls, and we see Christ (whose face is never shown) helping Ben-Hur with a drink of water. The expressions on the faces of Ben-Hur and the guard as they react to Christ's kindness, is one of the most moving scenes in film history. Only two actors are involved (and the back of a third), but the result is light-years beyond anything Cleopatra achieves.The acting in Cleopatra struck me as wooden and passionless, which is a fatal defect in a movie about a woman who was supposed to set men aflame with desire. Elizabeth Taylor did not impress me as a great beauty in this film. In fact, she looks kind of short, frumpy and chunky, though it's possible that beauty standards have changed somewhat since 1963. One of the few good points about the film is that it filled in some glaring gaps in my knowledge of Roman history. All in all, I would say the movie has a unique, grandiose, and epic kind of badness. You need to slow down and gawk at it, as you would a gruesome pile-up on the highway. You should see it just so you know how bad a Hollywood dog's breakfast can be.",Cleopatra
140,Momcat_of_Lomita,A milestone in movie productions,6,23 March 2011,"""Cleopatra"" was on one of the movie channels a couple of weeks back, and I sat down to watch it. My 18-year-old daughter happened to be home and she watched part of it with me.It was interesting to get the daughter's viewpoint on it. She's grown up with computer-generated effects; to her, ""Star Wars"" is an oldie classic, and this movie is from the paleolithic ages.I'm old enough to remember the splash this movie generated when it came out. And Elizabeth Taylor was movie royalty when I was growing up; to my daughter, she was a faded footnote to a time long ago.Daughter's view of the movie: nobody would dress like the characters in the movie; there were too many costume changes; and she was unimpressed by the sets and the grandeur of the production. She also thought that the actors and actresses were ""shouting,"" that the dialogue as written was unnatural and stilted, and as read by the actors was ""stagey"" and contrived.Gotta give her that. It's all true.She also found the movie too long and, eventually, boring. So she left off watching it to go do something more important, like go onto Facebook and ""talk"" to her friends.For all that ""Cleopatra"" is flawed, and in many ways severely flawed, I still believe that it's an important milestone for anyone who is interested in the history of movies. FWIW, we take it for granted nowadays that any movie can be set anywhere, in any time-period, and with any number of people in every possible kind of setting, and we can believe it: the computer wizards can do their conjuring, and we get the ancient Rome that we saw in ""Gladiator,"" we get the planet Pandora in ""Avatar,"" we get the impossibilities of ""Inception."" We don't have to suspend disbelief, and the filmmakers don't have to limit themselves to what could be built on a back-lot or done with a ""cast of thousands"" or the trickery of mat paintings.But in 1963, the filmmakers had to construct much of what we saw on-screen in Cleopatra, and what an undertaking that was! And up until that time, that was one of the things people WANTED in a movie: we wanted to be dazzled and awed, we were entertained by the the mere spectacle, the sheer grandeur of an epic like ""Cleopatra."" The glitzy costumes? A visual treat! The over-the-top production values? Bring 'em on! The spectacle of it all? We'd never seen anything like it! And yet the movie was, ultimately, a failure: because we'd reached a time where those things were no longer enough. The novelty of movies was gone; the novelty of the big-screen cast-of-thousands historical costume drama was at an end. It simply wasn't enough for a movie to be big, and stunning, and a visual treat. It had to be well-written, well-acted, it had to have a brisk pace and it had to have something to draw us in. Audiences had matured to the point where they didn't just want to look at a movie; we demanded more than a spectacle.And I think that's the value of ""Cleopatra."" It's a reminder that there was a time when the production itself could be a star. And the financial losses suffered by the movie's backers finally convinced the studios that it wasn't enough for a movie to have big stars, gorgeous costumes, and fantastic sets with thousands of extras.And that, ultimately, is how movies get better: when they reach a pinnacle of what has previously worked, and it isn't enough to make it a success. And that is the value of ""Cleopatra.""",Cleopatra
141,face-782-656201,Burton and Taylor's infamous historical epic,8,5 July 2010,"In 1963 20th Century Fox released their star filled epic Cleopatra. The public didn't know until later the massive strain it had put on it's production company , director and actors. When viewed it is obvious that much money and time has been put into it to make it the supreme drama it is. Infamous for nearly bankrupting 20th Century Fox Cleopatra has remained one of the most controversial motion pictures of our time. The film itself is beautifully shot and staged. The acting is incredible featuring outstanding performances from Burton, Taylor and McDowell. However it does seem unfinished which is understandable considering the amount of footage Darryl F Zannuk removed from the film , however this does not ruin the film for me and remains true to history and is a must see for any lover of film or history buff. Bravo Burton and Taylor 8/10",Cleopatra
142,straker-1,Mutilated potential classic,7,13 December 2005,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is rightly regarded as a classic, but many reviews make note of the 'illogical' story and bad character plotting. Characters come and go without rhyme or reason, and the plot makes no sense, they say. Well, yes, but that's not Fritiz's fault, nor the movie's; Metropolis makes little sense because 55 minutes of the film was hacked out and destroyed, never to be seen again, by the US distributors. Of course it's gonna be a dog's dinner with an hour missing, ya clods!!The same is true of Cleopatra, and this is basically the only reason the film fell flat on its' 1963 release. It was originally intended to release Cleopatra as two three hour movies, the first dealing with Cleo's relationship with Caesar, the second her affairs with Marc Antony. Fox said no to this idea, and demanded a single four hour film instead. This decision is like taking Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and removing an hour from each film wherever an hours' worth can be removed...a recipe for incoherence and total disaster.So, with two hours of footage gone, major characters are reduced to glorified walk-ons, vital plot points and motivations are lost, and the story loses what LOTR has...length with the proper pacing. People will sit and watch 4 hours of Return Of The King because it flows properly. People will not sit and watch 4 hours of stitched together rough cuts...that's what Cleopatra is, even in the DVD roadshow edition...because what we have is something that is too bitty and haphzard to sustain interest.But there is still glory in Cleo....Roddy McDowall, Martin Landau and Rex Harrison all act their socks off, the sea battle is kick ass, and Liz Taylor looks pretty scrummy in Egyptian softcore porn clothes. And only a Gen Xer like me could love that hideously pompous overblown dialogue.Great film! For what it is. It just should have been TWO films, that's all. Real eyepopping trippy spectacle, done in a 'damn the money, full speed ahead' way that just doesn't happen any more. Like Casino Royale, Cleo is a wonderful disaster.",Cleopatra

Cleopatra's entrance into Rome is really spectacular, but that it for spectacular in this movie.The music is really good though, and I wish I could find the CD for it. I gave my Blue Ray version of this movie away because I couldn't stand to watch it more than once. I saw it when it was in the theater as a little kid, my dad kept covering my eyes when the naked dancers came out.",Cleopatra
144,EW-3,Now I know why this is considered a bomb,3,12 May 2020,"A long time ago, I remember my high school English teacher telling us about this film, saying it was a very expensive bomb. Not having seen it at the time, I was under unable to understand why he said this; I just took his word for it. Now, finally, for the first time, I mustered the patience to watch this film from start to finish, and having seen it, I can fully appreciate what my teacher was talking about.I gave it three stars because, on the positive side, is beautiful to look at. Specifically, the cinematography is very good. The sets are gorgeous (I especially liked the view of the Alexandria port), although there's so many spectacular sets that it becomes a distraction. The costumes are also beautiful, although again, there are too many of them (In one scene, Taylor and Burton change costumes three times. Isn't that overdoing it?).Speaking of costumes, let me be blunt about something: Yes, Liz has got a great a chest. But is it necessary to show off her cleavage so many times in so many provocative outfits? That also becomes distracting, and helps to make this film into a parody. By the way, for those of us familiar with the legend of how Cleopatra died, and just where on her anatomy that deadly asp supposedly bit her, why aren't Liz's considerable assets shown off at that last critical moment? They are entirely ignored in that scene, and considering the ""build up"" we are treated to throughout the whole film, the climax comes as a let-down (puns intended).My biggest gripe with this movie is that it is horribly acted, with performances that are much, much too over-the-top. The best performance is that of Harrison, who seems to restrain himself from displaying unnecessary emotions and presents us with a character that is at least SOMEWHAT convincing.Not so with many of the other cast members. The two other principle actors (Taylor and Burton), and even some of the lesser characters (e.g., Martin Landau), engage in so much screaming and yelling in this film, and at least half of the time, I can't even decipher exactly what they are yelling about. The movie surely wants us to get caught up in the actors' emotions, but it's impossible to do so, as the story and the dialogue are not at all believable.That brings me to another big problem with Cleopatra, which is the script. It's all over the damn place. Right from the very first scene, the dialogue is hard to follow. The writers (and I understand there were a lot of them) seem intent to cover every detail they can imagine connected with this story. But failing to separate what we need to know from what we can do without, we are forced to wade through a talkative mess in order to follow the story.And that leads to a third big problem with Cleopatra: It's long, talky, and downright boring. If you have four plus hours to kill (and I will add that I had to spend considerably more time than that, as I kept falling asleep and had to back it up to the places where I would nod off) you might want to watch this. But if you have something much more important to do like scrubbing the floors or mowing the lawn, you're better off doing that. Sorry, Taylor and Burton fans, but that's how I see it.",Cleopatra
145,spk07,Just one of so many noble movies,10,25 February 2005,"This is the movie that got me hooked on historical epics from the fifties and sixties. I do not know where to start. First I'll mention the spectacular sets particularly of Rome and Alexandria. This was before CGI! The costumes were also finely detailed. Now I will mention the great cast. Every actor gives their role so much emotional value that you think that a whole separate movie should be made for their character. My favorite characters were obviously Julius Caesar (#1) and Marc Antony (#2). Rex Harrison gave Caesar such a imposingly powerful presence yet at the same time touchingly vulnerable value that I was saddened to see him killed at the end of the first half. He lived up to Caesar's rep and more. Richard Burton was a different kind of lover for Cleopatra: more tormented and at times insecure about his ability to live up to his fame. His abandonment of the Battle of Actium was particularly shocking. My two favorite Burton scenes were his rant to Cleopatra on her barge about being in Caesar's shadow and his soliloquy about his post-desertion guilt. Elizabeth Taylor was very emotional and intelligent in the title role. She can be commanding when she needs to be and vulnerable when it is safe to do so and at times both. She evolved Cleopatra from the young queen dropped at Caesar's feet from a carpet to the defeated monarch who lost her son, her second love, her kingdom but never her dignity. The ending was powerful and ""befitting the last of son many noble rulers"". The dual romances were great because they took their time without dominating the film. You believed that she really cared about and loved both these men. Alex North's score is unforgettable and deeply emotional. The script is intelligent, witty, literate, and strangely poetic. My one scruple is that the producers cut the original film by TWO HOURS! That is desecration right there. I hope they find that missing footage because I would definitely like to see more character development even though this film had its fair share. Still, this is a haunting, romantic, and eye-filling spectacle that remains high on my list",Cleopatra
146,nankipoo,A Leaden Performance by ET,5,6 October 2004,"I wouldn't presume to question the acting abilities of either Rex Harrison or Richard Burton. Both actors left admirable legacies and deserve the credit they received while living, and continue to receive now. Both Harrison (Caesar) and Burton (Anthony) bring their acting depth to their parts that make us realize why they're revered. More than that, we care about their characters.On the other hand, or on the other planet, we have the world's most overrated actress, Elizabeth Taylor, bringing a ""presence"" to the screen that could only be equalled by most high school senior girls in a Spring play. ET plays Cleopatra with all of the consummate woodeness that only years of practice and misguided praise could account for. The film cost millions and millions of dollars in 1963, and gave Burton and Taylor a showcase for their off-screen hijinks, but failed to raise the bar even a little, except for the jaw-dropping sets.By the time ET's ""Cleopatra"" finally expires, I was remembering the old 1934 version with Claudette Colbert and wishing for the over-the-top style of Cecil B.

This is not historical: the facts are here, they composed the movie as a dyptic centered around the character of Cleopatra but that is all. Except all the characters are exceptionally well written: from the aging Ceasar revival by the love of that childish but proud woman, to the confident Marc Anthony who is conflicted by his passion and his duty, his power and the useless man he feels he becomes, to the great Cleopatra, experiencing true love for the first time... They all are devastating, they all are human, evolving in Ancient times like they could be just today. And they were who they incarnated: Rex Harrison/Caesar is just this strongly experienced actor, Elizabeth Taylor is Cleopatra,famous since her young age, queen of the studios, inflexible. But still a woman, falling for her partner on screen, Richard Burton, a strong man more into Shakespeare than into the show business... and there is something that becomes appealing: the fame, the money, the success, all of that provided by his Cleopatra, the rumors and the scandal.All of that were the ingredients to sold this four hour movie to a greeding audience. Yes they are some both and ancient Romeo and Juliet, some archetypes of desire and lust on screen but there is also great and deep dialogs, strong acting, wonderful sets...

Yeah, it's around four hours, but if you don't mind literate dialogue- especially when spoken by Henrius Higginus- that's not a problem.

I had to sit through the whole 4 hours listening to Liz, Dick, and Sexy Rexy speaking German. Much later I finally got to see it with an English Soundtrack, but in Germany in the scene where Liz talks about her hips being wide for child birth, my friends wife who happened to be German, gasped and said, ""I could never say that to my husband!"" We tried to get her to tell us what Liz said, but we was too embarrassed and wouldn't repeat it! In all fairness, the other night Turner Classic showed the full version of Cleopatra and for for some reason movies that were flops in their initial release seem to age like a good bottle of wine. This film has aged and I have to admit that it plays better today than it did years ago. In other words, this film was ahead of it's time and today if you see the letterbox version you see why it's a magnificent film, but if you're ever invited to see an American Film in a foreign country, don't. I not only sat through Cloepatra, but Lawarence of Arabria as well as ""Gone With The Wind"" which is a hoot with a German Soundtrack!

153,MGMboy,The Return Of The Queen,10,31 March 2003,"That a film as good as CLEOPATRA is was created at all under the madness and panic of it's legendary production is indeed an amazing feat. That CLEOPATRA has been given such loving care in its restoration in this DVD of the ""Road Show"" print and the attendant bonus materials is a wondrous gift to those who love this film. The documentary, ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood"" is in on it's own an engrossing and informative two hour movie. For anyone who knows little of the history of CLEOPATRA, or who was not around at the time, this documentary will give them the feeling of what those last days of old Hollywood was like. And therein one can find the reasons why this intimate epic is indeed the wonder that it is. Many thanks should go to the Mankiewicz family and the producers of the documentary. The print and the sound of CLEOPATRA seems now to surpass what I recall it to be in its first presentation nearly forty years ago. The depth of the colors and the richness of the shadows are indeed splendid. In this restoration, it is hard to believe this film is as old as it is. The commentary track is in and of itself like finding the lost treasures of the long dead monarch. For there are wonderful recollections by Martin Landau, Tom and Chris Mankiewicz, and even the one of the films publicists Jack Brodsky gets to read sections from his book ""The Cleopatra Papers"" which gave a blow by blow description of everyday events on the set. But I must give special mention to Landau's part. With his keen eye for the art direction of John DeCuir one sees things in the background and along the edges of the scene that one never noticed before. Such lovingly detailed sets and interiors will never be seen again. The costs today are just too prohibitive.   Also his insights into what was cut from the film, particularly his and Richard Burton's contributions in the second act give one the idea of what Mankiewicz was intending. Poor Richard suffered the unkindest cut of all. The presentation of the DVD menus is so clever and exotic. The creators of this DVD are to be commended in their art direction. At last we now know what is behind the massive 20th Century Fox logo!The film itself remains what it has always been. It is a good film that might have been a great one if only Zanuck had trusted Joe Mankiewicz' original vision. It is said that they are still looking for the missing film; one can only hope that they succeed in this task. The performances range from good to excellent. Particular praise must go to Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Martin Landau, Robert Stephens, Andrew Keir, and Roddy McDowall. Lastly in this department there remains Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Cleopatra. At the films release the brickbats were reserved for her and for reasons that had nothing to do with her performance. Many reviewed her behavior as seen through the narrow focus of the tabloids and emerging paparazzi.  Even today it is sometimes hard to separate the history of the lady from her film roles. But here is the moment in time, in this film where she became the ELIZABETH TAYLOR she has remained in the mind of the world ever since. In this fact alone she is perfect in the role. But she is more than that. As Cleopatra she is at once regal and commanding, strong and tender, soft and hard. These are all the contradictions that have always been at the heart of Cleopatra herself. She and the Queen are masters of a public enigma wrapped within a mystery. In her performance as written by Mankiewicz Elizabeth Taylor is probably not too far off from the historical Cleopatra. Finally, ever since Judith Crist gave CLEOPATRA the needle in 1963 and in the act made her name, the public, for the most part, has viewed this film a failure. But today, stripped of the scandal, hype and hysteria of its release in June of 1963 it is now possible to view CLEOPARTA as the film it is. A near great film that is the signpost of when Hollywood passed from one age into another. Historically this is an important DVD and I recommend it highly. CLEOPATRA remains as seductive, beautiful, and intelligent as it was in Walter Wanger's original conception. ""Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.""",Cleopatra
154,emswan2004,Epic entertainment. Elizabeth IS Cleo.,10,21 August 2010,"Epic entertainment with Elizabeth Taylor an excellent choice for the part, even if she was older than the real Cleo. I enjoyed this movie very much. It illuminated historical events and personalities with color, clarity and passion. Cleopatra is portrayed as a real person, with intellect, ambition, and vulnerability, not just a lusty plaything. Multi-faceted characters, well-acted, with great cinematography, absolutely splendid sets, and music that is evocative and sultry, like Cleo, like Egypt. It's well-edited too, making a long and intricate story easy to follow. My only criticism is the usual casting of British actors in the roles of middle-easterners, which continues to today.

155,MichelleAudrey,The most mutilated epic in cinema history,8,23 June 2006,"I always pitied Joseph L. Mankiewicz for his attempts to make this film one of the greatest ever made and never actually getting full control of the project in the first place. Twentieth Century Fox was one of the reasons for the poor quality of the film that is available now. The problematic production costs, Taylor's fragile health and the Burton scandal are also to blame for the negative light that the film has bathed in for so long.Originally, Mankiewicz had planned to make two films - ""Caesar & Cleopatra"" - and - ""Antony & Cleopatra"" - each, three hours in duration. At the last minute Twentieth Century Fox announced that Mankiewicz had to make one complete film involving all characters. The reason for this was that audiences would not be drawn in the same numbers if ""Antony & Cleopatra"" was released the following year and Taylor & Burton had not still been together. As a result of this Mankiewicz had to cut out more than two hours of footage that had already been filmed, leaving the film at 4 hours and 7minutes, which is it's current duration. This again was cut back to allow the film to be screened twice a day, so the film was originally around 3 hours long. The two hours of footage have never been found and it remains a sad omen to the film that Rex Harrison, Richard Burton and Roddy Mac Dowell have all died without seeing the complete finished film.When one casts aside all the drama that overshadows the film, it unfortunately doesn't add up to industry standards, or my own personally. There are some credible scenes, which may only be believable as they encounter Antony and Cleopatra during their romance, at the same time as Burton and Taylor were creating their own. Harrison and Burton do rise above the rest in most scenes; particularly Caesar's defeated speech to Antony and the Senate. Burton's, Marc Antony is as Mankiewicz wanted him. A weak, little boy inside who strives to do all that Caesar could not…and fails subsequently. Burton surpasses Mac Dowell in this film I always felt, especially when Antony confronts Cleopatra in her bedchamber about her constant flaunting of the memory of Caesar. In conveying the weakness and hopelessness he feels in himself at that moment, Burton is flawless.Taylor fluctuates in her performance. At times it is believable that she is the ruler of all of Egypt. The queen who wishes to bring out the warrior in Antony. The child who needs protection and guidance from her mentor and father figure, Caesar. The mother who wants her son to be proclaimed as the true King of Egypt. The strong ruler who will defy Octavian at any cost. At other times, she appears depressed and seemingly hassled by having to play the part when there is so much going on elsewhere. In fact the true story of Cleopatra is completely overshadowed by the false 'facts', and the feeling that the film is going nowhere. Overall, Taylor does seem to be drifting in and out of a sea of consciousness and barbiturates whilst trying desperately to give a good performance. It is impossible to ignore all the drama off the set as it sears through during the film. In one of the final scenes after Antony has been taken away and Octavian demands that the queen should surrender herself to him, Taylor's state of mind is ambiguous. It could be that she is so immersed in thoughts of Antony's death, or it could be that she no longer cares about the part. Taylor has refused to discuss the film for years and probably never will, therefore leaving it in the hands of a confused audience.As far as entertainment goes, ""Cleopatra"" does not rank too highly. I think that the film is a sad documentation of the sidelines to what was supposed to be one of the greatest epics ever made. In a way it is timeless because there has never been a film with so much publicised baggage attached to it. It is by no means perfect, Taylor herself threw up upon seeing the premiere in 1963, and it is widely believed to be the film that killed Joseph L. Mankiewicz. It is far better than some other films that have been made since and deserves a place in cinema history for Mankiewicz's brave attempts at filming a movie with no stable script and managing to sign some of the world's most famous stars to make it on this basis. It is quite impressive visually, and would have been even more so had the continuity not been so poor - a repercussion of cutting out the two hours of film.Although it rarely appears in compendiums of great films, ""Cleopatra"" is a wonderful film. It's uniqueness and sad undertones make it interesting viewing, even if it is to get a glimpse of the Taylor-Burton affair in full swing.",Cleopatra
156,Stenun,Interminably long,4,14 November 2009,"Wikipedia tries to contain a plot summary of every film it has an article about. The various editors of that site have to battle hard to get most plot summaries down to a manageable level.

Far too full of itself. Full of so much padding that what little plot there is gets drowned out by yet another posturing rambling speech that goes nowhere. The actors and actresses try to make a memorable speech in each scene but this just serves to render none of them special or standout.

I don't think it's an altogether bad film, just a touch lifeless, solemn and far too long. As everyone knows, it died like a dog at the box-office, which I think was partly due to its enormous advance hype, which hardly any film could hope to live up to. Taylor and Burton were wonderful stars, but not wonderful actors, and this story needs actors to make the best of what scholars agree was not one of Shakespeare's greatest hits. It's an interesting might-have-been to imagine what it might have been like with, say, Anthony Quayle and Vanessa Redgrave in the leads. As for Rex Harrison as Caesar, that had to be one of the worst casting decisions of all time: sexy Rexy was born to utter brittle wisecracks in Mayfair drawing-room comedies, and not much else. Noel Coward told him that if he wasn't such a superb light-romantic leading man, he'd be good for nothing but being a showroom salesman for expensive second-hand cars.

159,gus81,Staid but enjoyable,7,24 January 2005,"Probably not one of the great epics, but still big and awe-inspiring. The performances are great, the sets are beautiful and the cinematography is sweeping. As epic eye candy Cleopatra is great to watch, but there is definitely something missing in the film.The film has an enormous Shakespearian lilt to it; lots of over acting and scenery chewing which allows Taylor, Burton and Harrison to really get into their roles. But this element in the film also makes the film fairly sterile and at times downright wooden. The often stagy directing does not help the matter either.The film also uses very limited settings. The whole four hours, apart from the scenes at Phillippi, Actium, and the senate in Rome, are all shot inside some palace or another - mainly Cleopatra's. This further infects the film with that stagy wooden quality. The audience does not get taken on a fantasy ride into the ancient world, but merely into the melodramatic lives of three 'kings' with whom the audience does not have a lot in common. The film eschews any opportunity to fully revel in the mood of the times. Unlike Kubrick in Spartacus, who included Roman political intrigue as a subplot which provided a rich contrast to the adventure of the slaves, Manikewicz only provides us with a quick glance at the political scene in Rome - a few seconds of the anti-dictator Cicero bad-mouthing the triumvirate. Neither did the film show the Romans' full and true reaction to Cleopatra's stay in Rome, which was one of distrust and scepticism as well as awe; it was content just to show her spectacular arrival and the mob's awe at it. This reluctance to focus on anything but the monarch's own melodramatic ambitions and arrogance robs Cleopatra of depth, and renders the film very wooden, staid and stagy. This disqualifies it from being one of the great ancient-world epics.But still, there are many scenes which are absorbing and great fun to watch. The sets are amazing, the costumes brilliant, and it is great to see all the late-great names on screen doing a magnificent job. Cleopatra is not a bad movie, it is a well crafted and sublime extravaganza, but it does not have a universal appeal. You need to have an interest in either ancient history or old film-making otherwise Cleopatra will seem like it has gone over budget and become a flop. A 7/10 for great acting, great visuals, and what is undoubtedly a well crafted film.",Cleopatra
160,miw-3,Much better than its reputation,8,20 March 2002,"I watched this movie over 3 nights on DVD, and was captivated through the whole 4 hours and 10 minutes or so it took.Elizabeth Taylor did a pretty good job in the title role as perhaps the greatest seductress in history, and Richard Burton was superb as Antony, but for my money Rex Harrison (Julius Caeser) and Roddy McDowall (Octavian) stole the show.For me the highlight of the film was the historical backdrop - Egypt vanished as a nation and Rome reached the peak of its power and started the descent into decadence - all in one movie, and as you watch this epic you gain some insight into the psychology and power politics that made the 4 major historical figures of the time. If Antony had been a little smarter, Cleopatra might have done it after all!8/10",Cleopatra
161,PennyLANE77,Bad reputation,7,20 June 2003,"Cleopatra has gotten a solid rep for being an overlong drab of a historical epic. True, its long, maybe too long. But that's weighed up by suberb acting performances, especially by Rex Harrison and Roddy McDowell. Also GCI wasn't even a weird figment in a scientist's head when this was made. With that in mind, it's hard not to be impressed by the visuals. They're better than the ones in Gladiator, which looked like Rome hit with a bucket of Blade Runner. After all, the visual splendor was one of the attractions of the genre in the 1950's and 60's. And here, it works!",Cleopatra
162,Slack_Er,"Do yourself a favor and watch HBO's ""Rome"" instead of Michael Jackson's best friend as Cleopatra.",5,11 February 2006,"Don't get me wrong, I love old movies! I especially love history pieces. I enjoyed ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben Hur"" but ""Cleopatra"" had a disadvantage: I had just finished watching season one of HBO's ""Rome"" and its brilliant portrayal of Julius Caesar's last years. The only thing going for this version made roughly forty years earlier (and reportedly the most expensive film ever made for its time) is that Elizabeth Taylor is a much hotter Cleopatra than the actress picked to play her in HBO's ""Rome."" It's a shame Hollywood was such a prude back in the days and doesn't give us any money shots of Elizabeth Taylor. I feel that's the only thing that could have rewarded me for sitting through nearly four hours of this movie. It would also help me remember Liz Taylor as a sexual goddess instead of ""Wacko Jacko's"" best friend and maybe the only person in the world who doesn't think something weird is going on in his bedroom at Neverland. And is there anything more silly than watching 5'8"" Richard Burton's Marc Antony with a ""William Shatner beer belly?"" You know what I mean, those actor guts that are held in check by a large girdle... errr... I mean belt. And the music.... ahhhhh! Why does every movie made from 1940 to 1965 about anything that occurred before 1000 A.D. seem to have the exact same melodramatic score? When I invent a time machine, the first thing I do is bring back the ""Gladiator"" soundtrack by Hans Zimmer so that filmmakers several decades ago can realize that it's possible to make history pieces with a little flair in the music department. No wonder bigotry, Vietnam, and all the other insanities of the Cold War were spawned. These people had no taste in quality cinema. Some people blame Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and others for ruining Hollywood, and we do get our share of ""Scooby-Doo"" and ""Police Academy 7"" these days, but as I watch more and more films that cover the same subject matter in today's popular media, I realize how much the motion picture industry has improved.",Cleopatra
163,Marc-105,Much better than its reputation; a very good movie,7,31 October 2014,"Cleopatra is surprisingly good. I don't know where its bad reputation came from.It looks gorgeous. They spent a mint making this flick, and they put every nickel on the screen. Great sets, truly spectacular costumes for Cleo. Let's face it: when she comes up the stairs on the barge in that white dress with that gold thing in her hair, she's the most beautiful woman on earth. Throughout the film, never has cleavage been so well packaged. Spectacle has never been done better: her entrance into Rome is unsurpassed. Consider that the sphinx is probably life-sized. And there will never be another naval battle like the one in this film.Several scenes are very effective because of the acting and dialog: Cleo and Caesar's first scene; when they're in bed together; Cleo and Antony's scene when she demands 1/3 of the Roman Empire (Taylor is particularly good in this one); Cleo and Octavian in her tomb (Roddy McDowall shines here).There are moments of clunky dialog: Cleo talking about ""the people"" after learning Caesar has been made dictator for life; in Alexander's tomb, Cleo talking about one world living in peace; Octavian's speech upon learning of Antony's death; Caesarion yelling ""the enemy"" over and over while playing on his toy horse.The cinematography is excellent (a well-deserved Oscar). My favorite shot is the pan of Alexandria just before King Ptolemy appears.There's lots of good acting: Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowall, Cesare Danova; Martin Landau; and others.I also want to put in the plug for Alex North's music. It's almost always very good. The opening and closing credit music is excellent. There's an odd moment as Cleo leaves the room after Caesar learns of the attack on the moon gate, and the music sounds too loud and just inappropriate.Yes, there are slow spots, but during them just sit back and enjoy the costumes and the sets.",Cleopatra

On the Bluray the visuals are stunning. The high level of its great scenic artistry is revealed in its full glory.The amount of detail is gorgeous. This movie was THE fashion film of the sixties. The clothes, hair and sets had profound effects on the designers of fashion and interior design for the entire decade. It may not be a perfect film, but it should be a prerequisite for film school students just for the pure beauty of its production values and its extravagance. Actually, with the level of clarity of the Bluray, performances have a new intensity. Small nuances like the raise of an eyebrow or a sneer can be appreciated more easily. Tears and sweat show vividly in scenes that appeared on the DVD to be just shine. The music score by Alex North is heard more precisely and shows why it was nominated for an Oscar. Movie scores don't get much better than this. In some ways this movie is about style over substance. It may have bankrupted Fox, but fifty years later it is still very much worth viewing. The same can not be said about Waterworld or Ishtar. As a thirteen year old artsy Egyptology loving kid, this movie blew me away when I first saw it in 1964. I still consider it close to the top of the list of my thousand or so favorite films.",Cleopatra
166,jmholt87,Ugh,2,26 December 2004,"This movie is befuddled, inaccurate, and above all else, Too Long. I can understand the desire to tell this story as it is one of histories most fascinating but the story in this case was botched in the telling. There is some neat Cinamatogrophy but on the whole the movie is to grandiose for my likes. The only redeeming quality to this move is the wonderful Roddy McDowell as the eventually victorious Octavian. Even his character is portrayed wrong. He is seen on the Senate steps conversing with senators as if he where one of them at the start of the film when JC is still in Egypt which is impossible considering Octavian hardly ever came to ROme and was only 15 at the time and would not have been allowed anywhere near the Senate house at that age. He is also portrayed as a cunning, power mad, and callous who skillfully forces Antony into war. Octavian did take advantage of what Antony was doing to force a war but it was Antony who foolishly declared war, thinking he could somehow win beat 300,000 Battle hardened Legionares with 3-4 proper Legions and 100,000 largely untrained and untested Egyptian Soldiers. This movie tries to glorify Antony as some kind of Doomed Hero and Romantic Martyr which makes the movie absurd because even using largely incorrect history Antony is revealed to be a rather stupid Thug which is truly what he was.1/5 terrible",Cleopatra
167,patroklosmech,Deserves top even not fully seen,9,23 February 2017,"Cleopatra is one of my favourite movies. The reasons for this are various.THe most superficial aspect about the movie is that of a lavish production. I enormously enjoythe rich, detailed and realistic sets and props, although they feature quite a few anachronisms, especially regarding Cleo's palace.Beyond that, the movie features some very good performances, with Harrison and MacDowall topping the cast, of which only one earned an Academy Award nomination and another lost one for supporting role due to a minor technical formality. Historical realism, including appearances and characters, is not the point of this movie. Otherwise Taylor would not have played the title role. A screenplay composed by historical accounts, those of Plutarch among them, but also a book which I have not read but I deem probably a pseudo-historical novel, the story is supposed to emphasise the struggle of Cleopatra for independence and dignity through any possible means. Her love for Anthony and Ceasar is portrayed as genuine infatuation, which is not known as a historical certainty, but her egotism and Egypt's interests rest also on the top of her priority list. A proof of this is her departure from Actium after learning without verification that Mark Antony is dead, to head to Egypt for regroupment and defense. In general events and guidelines the film is accurate enough to satisfy the reasonable amateur-historian viewers. Several minor or supporting historical figures are omitted probably to create a trio of great role- characters.As for the turbulent history of edits and releases I lament this the most for it is generally believed to have damaged the film and fracturing its continuity and meaning. Though the 250 min version which I have watched recently on Bluray proceeds logically through the plot, small abrupt cuts and connections occur and certain plot details and interconnections are cut. I have only seen photo stills from any cut scenes, among them a scene of the civil war between the Ptolemaic rulers which shows Cleopatra in her battlefield tent. I think that this opulent and well-crafted production deserves to present the viewers with all its magnificence of colours, sets and costumes and performances, for which so much ink, blood and gold has been wasted and nearly made 20th C-Fox sink financially. So, I will always yearn for a director's cut restored, remastered, reedited and re-scored in 1080p perhaps. I would personally sign a contract to buy a set of a 360 CLeopatra BLuray collection even if it cost 100 dollars, because I think that, after all, both the audience and the cast and crew deserve to have their toils fully compensated for having provided an epic which will be, when restored, the best crafted and also nearing the top in performances epic of the pre-CGI film era.So for all the above I give a 9/10, awarded specifically for the director's cut which J.L.M. certainly exchanged his career for.",Cleopatra
168,valgreet,Just about unwatchable,1,3 March 2006,"I have truly tried several times to watch this film. I have probably seen the entire thing at this point, and it has to be one of the worst films ever made. Garish and anachronistic, badly acted, boring dialog, you name it. The scenes between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are cringe-inducing; they were lovers in real life, how could they be so tedious on screen? Of course, the incessant blather they are speaking doesn't help. I could not help comparing Elizabeth Taylor's plump little dumpling of a Cleopatra with the slinky, gorgeous Claudette Colbert in the 1934 version. That movie, while dated, holds up better than this junk. I was not able to suspend disbelief for even one second and believe that I was viewing ancient Egypt, despite the vast sums of money spent on the production. A travesty.",Cleopatra

Standing firmly beside such great epics as 'Ben-Hur', 'Cleopatra' truly is one of the greatest films ever. With superb writing and directing by Academy Award winner Joseph L. Mankiewicz and excellent acting from Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, and Roddy McDowall. This is one of the last true epics. 'Cleopatra' is known as the most expensive film of all time (with inflation) and is said to cost over $440 million dollars if it were to be made today. The cost is evident through every detail through props and costumes. This movie also displays one of the greatest spectacles to see in a film: Cleopatra's Precession into Rome. 'Cleopatra'  is truly one of the greatest stories and films ever.",Cleopatra
170,nicolaos777,One of the greatest epic films that Hollywood ever produced.,10,12 May 2007,"At 243 minutes, this is one of the longest movies ever made. Nominated for 9 Academy Awards, (including Best Picture) it finally won 4 for its special effects, cinematography, costume design, and art direction. Impressive sets and costumes, remarkable styling, large scale epic scenes (such as Cleopatra's spectacular entrance in Rome or the sea battle in Action), thousands extras, excellent cast and, strangely for Hollywood's productions, a very historically accurate script, based on ancient historians (Plutarch, Suetonius, etc) consist an underrated masterpiece. It's the widely known tragic story of Queen of Egypt Cleopatra VII (69-30 BC), the last and probably most famous member of the Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty, that ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC. Cleopatra tries to maintain control of her kingdom and satisfy her ambitions to unite Egypt and Rome in a great empire by having affairs with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and later Mark Antony (Richard Burton) after Caesar's assassination. In real life Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton had a passionate affair on the set of this movie and finally became one of the most celebrated couples in Hollywood. Undoubtedly gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor (in my opinion the best Cleopatra ever on screen) was the ideal choice for the role of Cleopatra, being very close to Plutarch's description: ""...For her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was irresistible..."" (Plutarch, Lives, Anthony). Richard Burton gives a memorable performance as Mark Antony and Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar simply appears the depth of his great talent. Excellent performances too from Roddy McDowall as ruthless Octavian Caesar Augustus, Hume Cronyn (Sosigenes), Cesare Danova (Apollodorus) and Martin Landau (Rufio). ""Cleopatra"" actually was an idea of Greek American tycoon, Spyros P. Skouras, Republican Party's leading member and 20th Century Fox's powerful President. His dream was to present the audience a spectacle of unique grandness about the ill-fated last Queen of Egypt Cleopatra, that could compete TV programs, bringing people back to theaters and the success of other similar epics, (such as MGM's Ben Hur). He also wanted to pay a tribute ""...to the beautiful Greek Queen of Egypt..."" as he stated in an interview. But the movie's astronomical budget (44.000.000 $!!! in 1963, about 1 billion $ today!!!) caused his fall from Fox's ""throne"". Studio's heads doubted that ""Cleopatra"" could ever make back its record production costs and so they decided to remove him and terminate his long time reign in 20th Century Fox.. But despite Studio's fears it did well in 1963's box office with approx. 60 million $ grosses only in USA. Joseph L. Mankiewicz both directed and scripted ""Cleopatra"" brilliantly (although Skouras's friend Ruben Mamoulian was initially hired as director). Irene Sharaff, Vittorio Nino Novarese and Renie simply deserved the Oscar they won for best costume design and Hermes Pan did a splendid work in choreography.",Cleopatra

I can't believe such great actors like Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, and Elizabeth Taylor would be so grossly miscast. Rex Harrison's talent, especially, was totally wasted. Richard Burton looked awful in his mini, and Taylor was too overweight compared to her 50's heyday when she was truly beautiful. The script was poorly written, the story pointless and overdramatic. And boy did it D-R-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-G! I was totally bored the first fifteen minutes, and I had to drag myself through the whole four hours. Why?

From the time that it came out, I have remained a person who has not been afraid to say that I have loved it.Elizabeth Taylor's legendary beauty is very evident here. My favorite scenes of hers are Cleopatra's anguish upon finding out about Marc Antony's [Richard Burton] marriage and the closing scene with her reunited with the dying Marc Antony. Similarly, Caesar's [Rex Harrison] opening war scene, Marc Antony's gut-wrenching soliloquy as a broken man after the defeat at Actium , Octavian's [Roddy McDowall] harsh scolding of an officer that let him know of Marc Antony's death, Sosigenes' [Hume Cronyn] death scene, Apollodorus' [Cesare Danova] support for Cleopatra, and Rufio's [Martin Landau] support for Marc Antony are all permanently etched in my memory.The shear lushness of the production has to be seen to truly believed. Remember, this was released in 1963 far before the gimmickry of computer enhanced effects. The crowds in these scenes are real, the buildings are real, this is not a movie that was put together with the smoke and mirrors of computers. I truly do hope that restorers are able to eventually find the footage that was deleted, primarily due to Zanuck's influence and not Mankiewicz's desire, so that we may see more of what Mankiewicz had in mind.I also strongly recommend that one view the DVD release.

The logistics of moving tons of props around, building towns and army camps, putting hundreds of bodies on the screen; and all that just sets the stage. There's artistry on every level. Cleopatra riding into Rome on that sphinx must be the most spectacular stage entrance in film history. Young Roddy McDowell going to war against Richard Burton? Actors who can fill a stage as their souls are being crushed? Elizabeth Taylor as victim of her own manipulations? Wow. Not only are films like this not made anymore, nobody could afford to do it. We've plowed ahead with all our technology and lost something golden along the way. It looks more real than most modern CG films, and the staging is so easy to overlook: everything where it should be. The camera always has you firmly in the scene, where you belong -- you're not flying around like some drunken bird the way today's action films are (mis)directed.

Zanuck wouldn't let Mankiewicz show it as 2 films - each 3 hours long. He wanted to capitilize on the Taylor-Burton romance and that was in the 2nd part!The 6 hour script is full of details and complete characterizations.Mark Antony's life and death are filled out.

Too much focus on spectacle and not enough on story. It should come as no surprise to anyone that this film was the first to nearly bankrupt a studio (20th Centruy Fox). Others would follow. If adjusted for inflation, the film would still be the front-runner for the biggest catastrophe of all time (far worse than Heaven's Gate). The loss would be at least 200 million.The solution would have been to put it in more capable hands.

The next two hours were in short tedious, long and sometimes boring..The over-acting of Elizabeth Taylor(I still don't see why people are applauding her performance) becomes nerve-wracking..The many exchanges between her and Antony seem overextended and unnecessary. The battles are not even fully shown, but they are described on a diagram that Cleopatra makes. With a budget that still ranks as the highest, more should have come out. The only redeeming factor in the 2nd half was the short scene with Richard Burton where he is abandoned by the troops, and tries to attack all alone the armies of Octavian. (Best scene of the movie) This comes from a reviewer that loves epics, and doesn't mind a long movie, as long as it is beautiful or reaches a great point. With all the scandals, fired directors, and the attitudes of some actors a movie was destroyed and made into a regular ol' flick. Kudos also to Roddy MCdowall.He made a good Octavian. FINAL GRADE:(For this I had to combine both grades of 1st and 2nd part) A 10 for the 1st, and a 6 for the 2nd part.8 out of 10",Cleopatra
193,anse_basse,Who must see this film? Here's the answer...,10,12 October 2000,"If you're in to epic dramas, see it. If you're the least interested in the ancient world, see it. If you like great love stories, you can belive in, see it. If you're taken by excelent performances, see it. If you like the golden age of Hollywood, see it. If you like big sets and many extras you know are real, see it. If you're interested in film history, see it. And if you don't match any of the criterias, see it anyway. For the fun of it.It's the classical story of Cleopatra. The Egyptian queen that teems up with Julius Caesar and what such an alliance give birth to. I wouldn't say, it is as true to history as it could be, but it gives a vague picture of how it might have been. It portraits a life of a powerful women in a male dominated world, and a love story of many dimensions. This film surprises me over and over again, because there is always a little detail you didn't notice the last time you saw it.",Cleopatra
194,leightoncastle,Hammy acted rubbish.,1,20 February 2020,"Terribly acted, not surprising though with Liz Taylor. Overlong. A proper bore fest.",Cleopatra
195,faizahalam,Cleopatra - 1963,10,17 October 2006,"Cleopatra was one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I was 10 years old when I saw it and have never forgotten the excitement I felt when I saw the show. I was very young and have never forgotten the elegance and the beauty of the costumes, the scenes, and Cleopatra. While I was too young to really know what it was all about, it left a lasting impression on me and furthered my interest in Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. The splendor of costuming affected my taste in literature, fashion, music, and art. I tease my family members and tell them that I am a reincarnation of Cleopatra complete with henna for hair, surma for eyes, etc. I bought the movie on VHS and plan to purchase it on DVD. This particular movie will be left to my heirs.",Cleopatra
196,holly-fawell,great movie,9,10 April 2007,i thought Cleopatra was a great movie. the acting was quite good and the scenery and costumes were outstanding. this movie also stayed amazingly true to history so if you like good historical movies this is a must see. however it did seem cut (the second half in particular) so i would vote for a full restoration. Richard Burton is good as Marc Antony. Elizabeth Taylor is very convincing as Cleopatra and Rex Harrison is excellent as Julius Caesar. also great is Roddy McDowall as Octavian (later called Agustus Caesar. Cleopatra is one of my favorites. i would give the first half of the movie 10/10 and the second half 8/10 so the whole thing gets 9/10.,Cleopatra
197,faut3,Amazing in so many ways ...,9,27 February 2002,"I have this film in my DVD collection, and have watched it for the third time.  The script continues to amaze me in its simplicity, its directness, the fullness of its characters, the charm it brings to the actors.  The music is subtle and multi-textured - it brays in the battle sequences and weeps in a melancholic way in the love sequences.  As much as personalities of the time previously colored this film with their intrigues and wiles, I think the actors, the production crew, and the studio should stand proudly for ""Cleopatra"". It provides an amazing spectacle, a wonderful glimpse into human hearts, a sweeping epic that covers great events grandly, and, in toto, a complete motion picture experience.  Many more people should see this film than have.",Cleopatra

199,Sugarrunbees,A piece of history presented with a flair commensurate with the abilities of Joseph Mankiewicz.,10,25 August 2004,"Historically, Cleopatra takes the viewer into one of the most powerful governments on Earth. George Bernard Shaw weaves facts and imagination into concrete visuals.Actors chosen for various roles portray the looks, personality, and philosophy of their respective characters to a 'T'. Elizabeth Taylor shares Cleopatra's passion. Beautiful, sensuous, intelligent, desirous of bringing her beloved Egypt into the forefront of world power and politics.Rex Harrison portrays Julius Caesar's elegance, loyalty to Rome, and the hardness required of a good general and leader, but mixed with kindness and mercy. Mr. Harrison showed well what brought down Julius. Julius Caesar's need for warmth and love and his desire for a son made him fair game for Cleopatra, a powerful ruler also in need of passionate love and desire to please her man but secondary to her love for Egypt. Whatever description history and historians have given to Rome's leaders, Cleopatra's actors give outstanding performances and thereby present viewers with the flavor, the looks, and even the taste of Roman Empire power and leadership. Joseph Mankiewicz takes us onto the streets and and into the estates of Rome; the horrors of battlefields, and shows the idiosyncrasies of Egypt's Pharaohs, and how death battled life for ultimate power. One item lacking in the VHS version of Cleopatra is the elimination of the beginning commentary by a gentleman standing by Egypt's great Sphinx. His comments on Egypt, Cleopatra, and George Bernard Shaw provided an excellent set-up for this epic film.All in all - worth a 10.",Cleopatra
200,ellie89,People are too harsh,10,11 May 2006,"Let me start out first by saying that people are way to hard on the director, the actors and the movie itself. This movie was extremely ambitious for anyone to do, let alone produce it back in the 1960's. People don't realize how incredibly interwoven the true story was, and people need to keep that in mind while they watch the movie. The most amazing part of this film was the fact the director stayed so close to Plutarch's (famous historian) description of how everything happened between Cleopatra and Ceasar, Cleopatra and Antony, and Egypt vs. Rome. The film had to fit many many many years into four hours, a very tough thing to do. THe acting jobs are wonderfully done, Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal of Cleopatra was spectacular. She showed venerability, and in a flash of a second could showed her ""tough cookie"" attitude. This truly is one of my favorite movies of all time....!!!",Cleopatra
201,robertlb-2,Elizabeth Taylor Cleopatra is a great film but could have been better.,10,8 September 2007,"This film was suppose to be two films as Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw saw it, Ceaser and Cleopatra, and Anthony and Cleopatra, both films were aboutt 3.5 hours long, and were to be released 6 to 12 months apart, similar to the way the 3 Lord of the Rings films were released. these 2 Cleopatra films were completed, but fox studio pressured & forced the director, Joseph Mankowicz to cut the film down to the 4 hour and 3 minute version that we now have, but this only played once in New york at it's premier. The London premier was the 3 hour 14 minute version which the director was again forced to produce through edting down more footage. This is the version the most Americans, and indeed most people around the world saw in theaters. It was not until 1973, when it came on TV, (remember Sunday night at the movies?), that the 4 hour version was again shown, in 2 parts, 2 hours one Sunday, and 2 hours the next. My father, never having seen the film, told me being 16 at the time, it was a Bomb, however, as the film progressed, I vehemently disagreed, and despite his uninformed judgement, he was glued to the set both Sunday nights. when Cleopatra, i.e. Liz, is confronted by Agrippa, now Octavain's admiral, near the end of the film, and Agrippa basically states that Octavian will leave Cleopatra alone, if she provides the head of Mark Anthony, Cleopatra takes something of her necklace, a small head lke jewel, wips it at Agrippa and then says almost in a commanding, but more controlled Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf authority, voice, ""Give this to Octavian as my answer!! Octavian may have two heads for the price of one, either two, or none!"" My father then said, ""Boy Liz has a good underhand softball pitch"", and if you knew my father, he wasn't kidding. In any event. Because the film could only be shown once per night at 4 hours and 3 minutes, the studio forced the director to cut it down to 3 hours & 14 minutes, so it could be shown 2 times per night, i.e., more profits, at the expense of artistic vision. There has been talk about restoring the 2 films, I hope they do. I love ancient hx and Elizabeth Taylor, esp. during that period of her acting career. Also an Eyptologist, who works for the teaching co., at the end of his 36 lectures actually recommended the film stating that it was ahead of it's time, because it portrayed a more accurate picture of the queen as a intelligent noble just ruler, which she actually was, rather than just a seductress, that the roman propaganda machine painted, an image which has survived right into the 20th 21 st century. Remember, at home, just like a book, you don't have to watch the whole film or hopefully, one day, films, in one sitting. Do you have to read a book in one sitting? I think it is a wonderful film no CGI. They could only make a film like that now with computer enhancement. This was the real thing. And it did finally make a profit and continues to do so. robertbegun in 1995 to find the missing reels and restore the two films, but it only resulted in the 4 hour and 3 minute version being fully restored, with some extra footage on a 3rd disc which had been found. I would love to know if this effort continues. I for one, and both a great fan of ancient history and Elizabeth Taylor, especially roman history. Actually, despite some comments I have read, the film was remarkably ahead of it's time, painting Cleopatra not just as a seductress but a woman of intelligence, and capable of just rule, which is only really now coming to light in full, not the woman the roman propaganda machine painted her as. there were some mistakes, but trivial only. Even a Eyptologist of ""the teaching company"" actually recommended the film recently at the end of his 36 lectures. I would love to see the fully restored version as the director saw it.

202,darkoraj,Elizabeth is Cleopatra,10,8 September 2005,"This is one of the most spectacular movies in history. Everything in it was great, costumes, sets, acting - in one word SUPERB. I like Elizabeth Taylor,and it is fact that she was most beautiful woman in the world back 1950/60. So who else could play Cleopatra at the time? No one but her. Liz is just perfect as Cleo. Although critic's didn't gave much credit to her acting, for me she was very good. Harrison and Burton are just great as Caesar and Antony,so is Roddy McDowall as Octavian. Cleopatra was nominated for the Best Picture in 1963, but lost to Tom Jones (1963),and won four Oscars for Costumes, Set/Art Decorations, Visual Effects and Cinematography. Cleopatra is still most expensive movie in history. I hope one day six hours version will be found, and that Cleopatra will take her place as one of the best epics in film history.",Cleopatra
