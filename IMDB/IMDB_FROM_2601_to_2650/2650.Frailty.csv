0,Leofwine_draca,A film of disturbing brilliance,8,19 July 2016,"This thriller was obviously a labour of love for actor Bill Paxton, who directs and also stars in the leading role as a man convinced that the world is populated by demons masquerading as humans and who believes that God has given him a mission to kill them all. It sounds pretty odd, and it is, and it also could have been extremely cheesy BUFFY-style entertainment if handled wrongly. Instead, everything goes right with this film: great acting, direction, cinematography – and as a result it becomes one of the most disturbing mainstream films I've seen in recent years.The film works because you're never sure whether the characters really do have some supernatural mission from God or whether they're criminally insane. You do find out at the climax, and I have to say that knowledge spoils what otherwise would have been a flawless film; knowing for sure subtracts from the carefully built suspense that has come before. Otherwise, this is literate and engaging, boasting a truly frightening performance from nice-guy Bill Paxton playing to form, as well as some excellent support from a career-best Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe, an actor who can do no wrong in my eyes. The grisly subject matter might be a turn off for some, but the carefully detailed human relationships that are kept first and foremost are what made me keep watching this one.",Frailty
1,SnoopyStyle,dark psychological thriller,8,12 January 2016,"FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) at the Dallas FBI headquarters interviews Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) who claims his brother Adam is the killer in the God's Hand case. Adam committed suicide. Fenton tried to steal his body and bury it in their home town Thurman's rose garden. Fenton recounts the story starting from 1979. The brothers and their father (Bill Paxton) lived behind the town's rose garden. Their father starts having visions, and talking about angels and demons.Bill Paxton is brilliant. It's such a dark psychological thriller. The movie feels like climbing into the man's disturbed mind. The kids are solid. This darkness gets into the soul. I really feel for the kids trying to understand their father's madness. The sequence with the sheriff is riveting.",Frailty
2,Prismark10,The powers that be,7,6 November 2018,"Bill Paxton directed Frailty and also has a supporting role as a disturbed, religious zealot father of two young sons.Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into the office of FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) and tells him that his brother Adam is the notorious God's Hand killer.As Fenton travel with the FBI agent to the place where his brother buried the bodies. He recounts a tale of his childhood going back to 1979 when his world was shattered as his father had visions of demons masquerading as humans who had done evil things and who needed to be vanquished.Frailty is unnerving but is not as gruesome as you think, the slayings are not shown. It has a supernatural element and as a thriller it works because of the unreliable narrator. There is a hint of a twist as Fenton probes Doyle as to why he himself decided to become a law enforcement officer.",Frailty
3,claudio_carvalho,A Great Debut of Bill Paxton as Director in a Very Scary Low-Budget Movie,8,26 October 2003,"Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer chased by FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives in the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle requests some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widow father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the most scary movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I watched again, now on DVD. Although being a low-budget movie, the screenplay is sharp, with no flaw. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand'). If at least it were 'The God's Hand', it might be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Mão do Diabo"" (""The Devil's Hand"")",Frailty
4,kosmasp,Demonic,9,15 September 2010,"Bill Paxton is a really good actor. He might not always hit the mark with his movies, but the guy can act. And it seems he has a better eye for a project to direct, than he had sometimes with his acting choices. Plus being in front and behind the camera must have been really exhausting for him.But it all pays off. And it's not only about what way the story goes or if you think you know where it's heading (you might be in for a surprise or not). It's about the journey. And even if Matthew McConaughey has had quite a few bad acting choices himself (or the gigs he played while sleepwalking and without a shirt on), he really does show you what he is capable of in this little picture.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. That's it from me and don't let the bed bugs bite you ...",Frailty
5,gavin6942,"On Second Thought, Not a Frail Movie",7,19 September 2005,"What we have is a film starring Matthew McConnaughy and Bill Paxton (not Bill Pullman), who also directs. In flashback, Matt tells the tale of a murderous father (Paxton) who sees demons inside seemingly innocent people. His two sons go different ways -- one embracing the murderous lifestyle and the other trying to run. The first time I watched this (September 2005), I had no idea why the party brothers made me watch this film. I thought it had nothing really worth going out of your way for. It didn't bring back memories of my childhood, and the re-watchability factor was seemingly next to nil. However, I watched it again (January 2010) and think I must have been crazy the first time. This story was very well crafted.The ending (I won't reveal it) was very predictable and incredibly cliché. At least, part of it was. But there's one minor twist that will surprise you and make you want to watch it over again. I had forgotten it from the first viewing and it struck me hard.This film was ranked one of the best horror films of 2000-2009, and I think that's fair. Granted, some people think ""Jeepers Creepers"" is great. But this one really was overlooked, despite being pimped out by the likes of Stephen King and Sam Raimi. The film is worth owning, because not only is it a good film, but the special features are crammed on here. Multiple commentary tracks, deleted scenes, some featurettes. If there's anything that can make a good film better, it's the supplements, and this disc has them.",Frailty
6,lee_eisenberg,Don't worry: it won't leave you feeling frail.,7,12 March 2006,"A story about a single father trying to convince his two sons that there's demons everywhere seems like the sort of thing that would come out completely idiotic. But they pull it off here rather neatly. It's the story of how Dad Meiks (Bill Paxton, in his directorial debut) got his sons to help him kill people whom he claimed were demons in 1970s Texas. Does he sound crazy? Maybe, but after you see the movie, you may have doubts about everything. Because believe you me, contrary to what you may expect, Matthew McConaughey can actually play a creepy role; and that's just what he does here.Texas sure has turned out some interesting directors: first Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, and now Bill Paxton.",Frailty
7,moonspinner55,"""It was like a long, long dream""...more like a snooze",3,2 January 2017,"Two young Midwestern brothers in 1979 are at odds over their widower father's recent actions: he's convinced an angel has selected him to kill seven demons on Earth in the final days before Judgement. The angel has even selected the weapons he is to use, and his boys are to become his accomplices. Actor Bill Paxton also directed this unconvincing and rather pedestrian character study-cum-thriller from a screenplay by Brent Hanley. Paxton is so laconic and low-keyed as a performer (and as a filmmaker) that the father's horrific actions don't make much of an impact. The youngsters face their father's deeds with grim resolve, while Matthew McConaughey (as the older brother now an adult) narrates the proceedings with solemn detachment. *1/2 from ****",Frailty
8,Quinoa1984,Paxton's first directorial job is a good old jab at the horror/drama,7,12 April 2002,"Frailty suffers somewhat towards the end of the film by confusing the story into a guessing game of which guy is which (McConaughey is a part of this not to spoil anything important), but for the bulk it's worth the time and popcorn.  Paxton and his crew have concocted an often original, deep thought inducing picture with more chills than gore, which also works for the feel. 
Here, McConaughey starts off in an FBI man's office and tells the story of of him, his brother and his father back in 1979.  His father was a good father and loved him and his brother, but one night dad (Paxton) gets visited by the angel of god or other and is commanded to ""destroy the demons that possess human beings"".  He also brings along his two sons to assist him in his tasks of destruction much to the dismay of McConaughey's younger form (played in one of the best recent kid performances by Matt O'Leary). 
What is revealed in this movie caused me to think deeper than I should've, or should possibly.  This tale is almost in the vein of what happened with Andrea Yates and her drowning her kids- parents will is brought upon the children by the hand of god's command (the tasks once done by Abraham and such is mentioned as well).  It is difficult to classify Paxton's dad right away as a nut case cause he is shown to be sane through it, and that adds the intrigue to his character and the nightmarish reality on his kids Adam and Fenton.  This is something you don't really see much in movies in general and a quick peek at the least is highly reccomended.  It's not a great achievement however it's enveloping style is undeniable.

9,wes-connors,Bill Paxton Is Touched by An Angel (with the Devil in the Details),8,9 May 2010,"""Years after terrorizing a small Texas community, the 'God's Hand Killer' has returned - leaving in his wake a perplexing trail of fear and death. Convinced that he knows the killer's identity, Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) shows up at FBI headquarters, intent on putting an end to the murderous rampage and relieving his conscience of his family's sinister secrets,"" according to the film's official synopsis. From there, we go back to the year 1979, and Mr. McConaughey tells his story He is young Matt O'Leary (as Fenton), living with younger brother Jeremy Sumpter (as Adam) and their widower father Bill Paxton (as Meiks). Mr. Paxton, a beer-sipping mechanic, is obviously a devoted and caring father. One evening, he wakes his boys up with some startling news. Paxton tells the boys he's had a vision from God - an angel, Paxton claims, visited him with God's plan for their family. They will be given magical weapons, and are directed to kill people God considers Demons Twelve-year-old O'Leary thinks his father has gone crazy, but nine-year old Sumpter is more impressionable. Then, Paxton produces the weapons he claims have been sent from God - a lead pipe, an ordinary axe, and an old pair of work gloves. Next, Paxton shares a list of seven local residents (Sumpter wants to add a kid who has been bullying him, but Dad says no). The killing begins, with O'Leary only reluctantly taking part. When his father wants him to start wielding the axe, O'Leary balks ""Frailty"" is an almost-perfect picture, beautifully directed by co-starring Paxton; if Alfred Hitchcock were Orson Welles, he might be Bill Paxton. There are so many memorable scenes - they not only build upon previous cinematic images, but will certainly be ""homaged"" by future filmmakers. Everything falls magically into place - from the neatly planned window rain segueing into an episode of ""Davy and Goliath"", to the beautifully timed moment when O'Leary's taps a stubborn flashlight.The flaw (put delicately, but please see the movie before reading comments) is that one of the story's revelations is unfair. A major character (the one played by Sumpter; O'Leary is the main character) tells an incredible lie about his identity. The lie isn't the problem; rather, it's that the film's structure doesn't make room for the differing interpretation. This can be confirmed by paying attention on second viewing. Switching to McConaughey during more of the narration would solve the problem.Paxton, cinematographer Bill Butler, editor Arnold Glassman, and composer Brian Tyler should have received some ""Academy Award"" consideration; they were recognized by other organizations. Usually cast in stud roles, ""Best Supporting Actor"" McConaughey contributes a haunting characterization. Steely-eyed lawmen Powers Boothe and Luke Askew are employed well. And, O'Leary is outstanding. The story only needed to play fair with its narration, and retain ambiguity.******** Frailty (11/17/01) Bill Paxton ~ Matt O'Leary, Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey, Jeremy Sumpter",Frailty
10,Coventry,The Demons are among us...,9,14 September 2003,"Seeing that this movie was made in 2001, it gives you a great feeling...pure talking cinema, that is. Namely, that it's still possible to make a terrific supernatural thriller with a great story. We've only seen bloody slashers since 1996 without even an attempt to tell a story. In that point of view, Frailty sure is one of the best motion pictures since the new Millennium. And I'm very glad it came from the hand of Bill Paxton. I knew he was able to pull off something like this. In general, he still is one of the most underrated actors ever but many people begin to understand that he is among the greatest minds in Hollywood. This may easily be the best directorial debut coming from an actor since Gary Sinise's ""Of mice and Men""...And no, I didn't forget Mel Gibson, I hated Braveheart...that's all. Now, when we're talking about the plot...it doesn't give you a great feeling at all. This movie has the ability to scare you and, even more important, it makes you think. It's about a father who received a vision from God himself. He and his sons are chosen to serve Him. They get a list and the ability to separate demons from humans and then destroy them ( the demons I mean ) The father and the youngest son Adam fulfill this mission but Fenton, the oldest son, thinks that it's just murder and he tries to stop his beloved family. When you're fascinated by the story (and I can't imagine you're not) , you can't help thinking about the fact that there ARE people like this walking around...claiming they have a mission from God. I certainly wouldn't call this movie fiction, so in that point of view, I'd even say it's scarier than absolute classics like The Exorcist or . The Changeling.And then there are the plot twists and the surprise elements. Don't believe these people who'll tell you it's predictable. Even when you're living the story and focus on every single minute, you'll still be shocked at the end of this film. It's terrific in every single way. As an actor, Bill Paxton does what always do : give away a flawless performance. Powers Booth is excellent as ever and even Matthew McConaughey delivers in this movie and he's not my favorite actor at all. Honorable mention as well for the 2 boys who both do a fine job. No seriously, if you just like me keep complaining about the fact that they don't make movies anymore like they used to...you've got to give a chance to Frailty. You'll be very impressed and touched. The second viewing is even better as you start to discover many many hidden clues....",Frailty
11,michaelRokeefe,Not your typical God fearing man.,7,13 April 2002,"A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller/who-really-done-it recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong, well-conceived horror tale about a devout, but demented man in Thurman, Texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control mankind. A couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. Most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double up your stomach.Director Paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son that ends up telling this story to a Dallas FBI Agent(Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspenseful white knuckler! Highly recommended.",Frailty
12,preppy-3,Disturbing,8,22 April 2002,"Kind, widowed Texas dad (Bill Paxton) is bringing up his two sons Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) and Fenton (Matthew O'Leary)--it's made clear that he loves them both very much.  Then, one night, a ""vision from God"" tells him to kill some demons disguised as people.  He follows the orders and drags his two young sons along with him.  Fenton starts getting very scared about his dad's sanity. Creepy, scary and absorbing movie is part horror movie, part psychological thriller, part coming of age movie, part religious...and it all works beautifully.  The direction by Paxton is assured (hard to believe this is his first directed movie) and his acting is just flawless--he's always good but he's great here.  Young Matthew O'Leary is another standout--you really feel his confusion.  Also Powers Boothe (obviously enjoying himself) is good and Matthew McConaughey plays his usual laid back self and flashes those beautiful blue eyes (and there is a shirtless scene--thanks Bill!)The story is complex and twists and turns in directions I didn't see coming. The killings are all off screen--this is NOT a blood and guts movie. Basically it's a very good thriller.  Be warned--there is a very hard to watch sequence with child abuse.",Frailty
13,LeonLouisRicci,Different and Disturbing,10,15 December 2013,"Forget what You remember about the way Movies make You feel. There is a general category of responses to the viewing experience, the thing that makes Movies what they are and why they are such a popular form of Entertainment. You won't find this Film's residue on the usual checklist. It has a unique and very unsettling feel and it is this that makes this something special.Forget Horror Movie conventions and Serial Killer Stories that are formula even when they are done Artistically, like Stephen King, John Carpenter, or any number of talented Auteurs. This is a Modern Day, Southern Gothic Tale of madness, mental illness, and just the just plain delusional.Children in peril are a tricky thing to take on in Fiction because in Real Life it is so disturbing and Evil that it is hard to contemplate even in a made up Yarn. So first time Director, Actor Bill Paxton has taken quite a big bite here. It is amazing that He not only chews it up just fine but makes the Audience swallow the whole thing and that has caused many a Viewer and Critic to reach for the Pepto Bismol. The much discussed Ending is not as clear as it first seems and upon deeper reflection may have many changing Their first impressions.

14,poolandrews,Good thriller.,6,11 July 2010,"Frailty starts late one night as at the FBI headquarters in Dallas where a man named Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) tells Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) that he know's who the God's Hand serial killer is, Fenton claims that the killer is his brother Adam Meiks. Agent Doyle is sceptical but Fenton goes on to tell him an incredible story about his childhood & his religious father (Director Bill Paxton) who after seeing visions of Angels sets out to destroy demons by killing people who who had committed sins & were named by the Angels, Fenton says he could only see his father murdering innocent people & refused to believe in God & Angels but his father tried to convince him otherwise. Fenton claims that when his father died Adam carried on where he left off...This American, German & Italian co-production was the feature film directorial debut of actor Bill Paxton who many people will have seen in a film or two & will remember the guy but probably won't know his name, he's been in films such as Alien (1986), Near Dark (1987), True Lies (1994), Apollo 13 (1995) & even Titanic (1997) to name but a few. This film is all about the script & it's concepts, ideas & it's twist's. The framing narrative of Frailty is similar to The Usual Suspects (1995) in which a story is being told to some law enforcement agent explaining some criminal plot right down to the twist ending which are also strikingly similar as the storyteller turns out to be not who we originally thought but the main body of the film deals with two young brother's who just happen to have a crazy religious nut as their father who starts killing people after Angels from heaven told him to. The main concept of Frailty is the conflict between the young Fenton & his father, the way Fenton denounces God while his father insists he is right makes for some gripping scenes. The majority of Frailty is left ambiguous but the end where everything is revealed the script seems to suggest that they were right & that Fenton became a demon in a roundabout ironic clever sort of way that gets you thinking I suppose & is a debating point. While not the masterpiece many seem to consider it I did like Frailty, it's a well thought out psycho thriller with various religious overtones & explores some ideas & themes that you may not expect it to.The directing is solid & it's a fine looking film although not overly memorable in any way besides the striking script. The film doesn't focus too much on the murders as it's more interested in the twisted motivations & reasons behind them, there's a bit of blood splatter but nothing graphic. Not your typical father & son sickly relationship Hollywood feel-good drama the title Frailty apparently refers to the disintegration of the family, the distributor wanted to call the film God's Hand but director Paxton & writer Brent Hnaley insisted the title Frailty be kept.With a supposed budget of about $11,000,000 this was set in Texas but mainly filmed in California. The acting is strong all round, the young child actor's are good & don't annoy either while Paxton puts in a solid performance with Powers Boothe & Matthew McConaughey also earning their fee.Frailty is a hard film to categorise as it's part thriller, part horror, part domestic drama & part mystery but if your prepared to put the effort in & watch it then it's a fairly rewarding experience. Not a masterpiece but better than average.",Frailty
15,Boba_Fett1138,A decent movie but hardly worthy of its good reputation on here.,6,11 April 2009,"This is a decent movie at its very best. It's very well watchable but as a genre movie its too lacking in its story and execution of it. With all of its praising this movie is receiving on here, it surely is a bit of an overrated movie.Problem for me while watching this movie was that I knew that this was simply the type of movie in which nothing is what it seems, which made me all the more aware all of the time, making me see lots of the twists within this movie from miles away already. The movie was just being a bit too obvious with its intentions and what directions it was heading toward. The movie therefore wasn't really being very surprising, despite having more than a few twists to its story. Also a bit too many perhaps. It's best to have one big twist at the ending than to have multiple twists throughout its entire story. It's just less effective and powerful.Guess its a good enough first theatrical directorial movie debut for Bill Paxton, who doesn't provide the movie with a good style or distinctive atmosphere but nevertheless sets the right mood and knows to tell the story, despite the story not being all that great. The movie never made it to most cinemas though and its not hard to see way. The movie is too typical for its genre and it doesn't stand out in any way. Movies like this get made by the dozens each year, especially during those days and there simply are far better and more surprising genre movies to watch out there.For his first big movie Bill Paxton knew to get some big names involved. It makes you wonder though if they would had also agreed to this project hadn't Paxton been involved in it. Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe are some big name actors but also the crew has some big names in it, such as the director of photography Bill Butler.It's also hard to see what the movie and its story try to achieve really. Are we supposed to be sympathetic at the end and which side are we supposed to be on? The movie perhaps in the long run leaves more questions than answers really, which makes the movie a bit of an unsatisfying one.No, it's no bad movie but it's also far from a must-see as well really.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Frailty
16,view_and_review,That Was Crazy!,8,8 February 2021,"""That was crazy!"" was my response to nobody after watching this movie by myself. As this dark movie was slowly snaking its way toward a conclusion I kept wondering, ""What's going to happen here?""""Frailty"" starts with Matthew McConaughey's character seated in a Dallas FBI office waiting to talk to a particular agent. When the agent, Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), finally meets Matthew M., M.M. conspicuously doesn't shake his hand and proceeds to tell Doyle that he knows who the God's Hand killer is. From there M.M. goes into a story going back to 1979 and his father (Bill Paxton) who believed he was receiving divine guidance to kill. His dad was such a believer that he included his sons in his ""work."" Dad said that he was called upon by the Lord to ""destroy demons"" who walked around in human form. He even had a list of names that was revealed to him.*Just imagine the show ""Supernatural"" if Sam and Dean Winchester were hunting people.While M.M. is telling this story we're seeing it happen as a flashback. The longer he tells this story the more you're wondering where it's going to wind up, but you're totally engrossed in the entire ordeal because a DUDE IS KILLING PEOPLE WITH HIS YOUNG SONS, and one of them whole-heartedly believes his dad.The craziness doesn't stop until the very end where we get a serious twist. The thing about twist endings is that a movie has to be compelling enough up until that point. Using the IMDb scale, a movie can't be a 1/10 for an hour and a half and then throw a 10/10 twist in there. No one is going to bear through a paltry movie just for a good ending. A movie has to be at least a 5/10 to make an ending worth it. This movie was better than a 5/10 already, and the 9/10 ending only made it better.",Frailty
17,The_Void,A well worked and original little thriller!,8,12 March 2007,"It's true that there are more than enough thrillers about serial murder - and so it's always great when a film comes along and plays with this premise - and Frailty does that brilliantly! Bill Paxton is obviously best known for his acting work (which includes film-stealing performances in films like Aliens and Near Dark), and here he gets to work both in front of and behind the camera as we get a typical Paxton-style show stealing performance, and he directs also. Obviously, this isn't a film that will break any boundaries; but Paxton takes his plot and spins an entertaining and exciting thrill-ride around it. The film opens with a man named Fenton Meiks arriving at a police station. He tells the agent in charge of the 'Gods Hand' case that he knows the identity of the killer that has been terrorising the local community. The film then moves into flashbacks, as we find out that the man's father received a vision from God, in which he was told to destroy demons. The film focuses on the father's two young boys; one of whom believes his father's visions, and one that doesn't...If you were to properly analyse the film's message, you would no doubt come to the conclusion that there are many holes and ideas that don't really make a lot of sense. But this isn't important, as Frailty does everything that you could ask of it. The religion theme is well done, and the film provides an interesting perspective where God is concerned. The acting is excellent, with Bill Paxton in a somewhat dumbed down, but no less intriguing role than usual. The support cast includes Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe, both of whom are well used. The real acting comes from child actors Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter; who both manage to star in the film without becoming annoying. The film has many themes outside of the central religious one, the most frightening of which is the corruption of youth. Paxton does a really good job of blending the boys' childhood story with some quite gruesome horror, and while the film does have some failings where some of the central ideas are concerned, it's not too important as Frailty is a well worked thriller that does what it says on the tin!",Frailty
18,zetes,"Great story and acting, but needs a shot of adrenaline",7,26 April 2002,"Frailty has a hugely innovative script. Perhaps it should be remembered when Oscar time arrives at the end of 2002. And Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey are very good as well. Paxton especially, who also directed, gives one of his best performances. His best, in my opinion, was in A Simple Plan, but this is nearly equal. And I never cared for McConaughey, but he's pretty good here. Matthew O'Leary, who plays the younger Fenton, is a find. He creates a very believable character. Jeremy Sumpter, young Adam, is nearly as good.My major criticism of Frailty is that the film doesn't generate enough dread in order to make it into a really successful horror film or thriller. As it stands, it's just an interesting serial killer drama with some good twists at the end. There were maybe two spots that made me jump. I never felt frightened at all.

It is well directed, and portrays a X files style.  The bad part is how thine the story is.  We do not understand why this is done.  If and who is evil, and why it needs to be stopped.

There's little suspense, few thrills, and almost no action leaving just so much plodding, stoic, and somewhat monotonous drama full of redundant whacking and God-talk. Overall ""Fraility"" is a moody flick with somber atmospherics, good art and technicals, okay acting, etc. but don't expect much of a story. Over-rated but worth a look for those into horrific dramas. (C+)",Frailty
23,KineticSeoul,Crazy twisted thriller that gets more intriguing as it progresses,8,22 December 2011,"Now this movie is a crazy twisted thriller that will intrigue and entertain most viewers without it having much blood and gore. There is blood but most of the violence happen off screen. I wasn't sure of this movie from the start but as it progressed it started to get more intriguing bit by bit until the finale. Sure some of the twist might throw some viewers off and might even get some viewers angry. But it goes in a ballsy direction, although sometimes the twists makes it seem like they weren't sure which direction to go at first. But overall this is a satisfying thriller that is also creepy at times and just might stick with some audiences for a while. For some parts this is a thriller or psychological/thriller that some audiences will have to go with for some parts in order to get the most out of it. Just when you think you might have everything down and know what is going on will be in for a loop. The movie just isn't all that predictable and the twist didn't seem way too forced either. As the movie progresses it just keeps getting better and better although some might get ticked off or irritated by the ending. Although some won't mind it and still enjoy this movie for what it is. And like I said it's a thriller the audiences will have to go with in order to enjoy. I am not saying it's a movie the audiences have to look past it's flaws but for other reasons.8.1/10",Frailty
24,thesar-2,Hardly Frail,10,3 March 2013,"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee."" – Jules from Pulp Fiction. (Oh, and I guess, also The Bible.)Mercifully, that blatant line was not used in Frailty, but it does sum it up, nicely.It's hard to believe one of my favorite movies that I just re-purchased, this time on BluRay, is now 10 years old. It's also one of my favorite suspense films – though, it borderlines horror.And speaking of ""horror,"" I loved this movie when I first saw it many years ago and I recall one of my first thoughts: Damn, a brutal ""slashing/horror"" film where they hardly show any intense bloodbaths..and that's a good thing. With the exception of one axe-wielding scene, all hacks are off-screen. Not only was that original back then, it's still refreshingly unique today.Oh, and so was Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton's best performances. To date, I have yet to see either of them do as good as they did here.The only minor flaw – and I mean extremely minute – was the fact upon repeat viewings, and this is probably my third to fourth time, once you know ""the secret,"" the movie changes for the viewer. Not necessarily in a bad way, because it was brilliantly made, so there is a lot more to attach onto. Same could go for Fight Club. I saw it only twice – once in theatres and once on DVD, and only that second time to ""catch everything I missed"" but overall it was still a fantastic film with great performances, like Frailty.Frailty shows us a widowed, hard working and (definitely) religious father of two boys who takes up ""God's Plan"" to rid the planet of ""demons."" He's ain't no Ghostbuster; these ""demons"" he's targeting are human beings. While one son follows his daddy and his killing spree with the blind innocence of young children, the other and older son is thinking more rationally and objects to his Dad's killing these strangers.That story was all told in flashbacks from one of the (now) adult children's point of view (McConaughey) to FBI agent Doyle (a very nice Powers Boothe) when he's attempting to provide proof of both the ""God's Hand"" killer (Bill Paxton) and where the bodies are buried.Even though I only tipped the iceberg of the overall plot, I feel like I've said just enough before spoiling anything.Look – the movie is literally fantastic in many ways: mood, score, acting, dialogue, cinematography, shocks and frights – including fear of mis-directed religion activists. It's hard to believe that this was Paxton's feature-length directorial debut and to-date, only has completed one more movie. I say that, because this was not just professionally made, but aside from one minuscule psychedelic scene, it looked like it was made from one of the masters of film.If you have not seen this, I highly encourage you to see this disturbing look into what someone's capable of when ""God's Angels"" direct him to kill fellow humans.",Frailty
25,sol-kay,Shocking and disturbing as well as effective film,9,9 November 2003,"****SPOILERS**** On a rainy night in Texas FBI agent Wesley Doyle, Powers Boothe, the man in charge of the investigation of the ""God's Hand Murder"" case is summoned to his office to talk to a person whom he was told has valuable information about the crimes. As agent Doyle enters his office sitting there calmly and looking at a portrait of agent Doyle and his mother that's on his desk is Fenton Meiks, Matthew McConaughey. Asked by Doyle to put the portrait down and tell him what he knows about the ""God's Hand Killer"" Fenton tells him that he knows who he is, his younger brother Adam, Jeremy Sumpter, who killed himself earlier that evening. At first Doyle thinks that Fenton is just another person who's trying to get his name in the papers but when he calls the sheriffs office in Thurman, where Fenton says he comes from, he's told that the police are looking for Fenton and want him to return an ambulance that he drove away with his brothers body in it! This shocking an true revelation of Fenton's part makes Doyle think that there's something to what he's is telling him. Hearing him out Fenton begins to tell agent Doyle a story that shocks as well as intrigues him. Back in the summer of 1979 when both Fenton and Adam were little boys being brought up by their father, Bill Paxton, they were awakened on night by Dad Meiks. Dad Meilks told them that he got a vision from an angel that they've been chosen to battle the evil ones on earth and soon the angel will contact Dad Meiks with a list of names of those evil ones that they are to kill. At first Fenton thought that this all was just a bad dream but the next morning when his father drove him and his brother to school and told them not to tell anyone what he said to them last night Fenton realized that it was all real! His father has gone over the deep end and was taking him and his brother Adam with him. After getting a list of the evil ones whom were to be killed from the angel Dad Meiks committed a number of brutal murders which he made the two boys watch. At first Fenton didn't want anything to do with them and tried to get his brother Adam to run away with him from their deranged father. Adam, being younger and more impressionable wanted to stay and help his dad in the stamping out of the evil that's in the world.Fenton goes on with the story of how his father put him in the basement to punish him for not going along with the angel's instructions. Later when his father thought that Fenton was ""cured"" of his negative and unholy feelings he took him out to kill one of the evil persons that the angel instructed him to kill. Fenton ending up killing his father instead . Even after his deranged and sick father was gone it seemed that his brother Adam was still carrying out his fathers work until that night when he killed himself. As the rain starts to get heavier Fenton tells agent Doyle that he'll show him where the bodies of the ""God's Hand Killer"" are buried to prove that he's telling the truth. Handcuffed Fenton is driven by Doyle to the spot where he was told that the bodies of the killer would be found and what Doyle finds is much more then what he ever expected. ""Frailty"" ranks right up there with movies liked ""Psycho"" an ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" as one of the most effective as well as disturbing movies about serial killers ever made. The movie is far better then the highly advertised and overrated ""Silence of the Lambs"" with the added punch of the murderer indoctrinating his two innocent sons in participating in the crimes. Even more shocking is that Dad Meiks and his sons look and act like they came off the set of ""Father Knows Best"" or ""My Three Sons"" instead of characters straight out of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"". That's just how normal and stable they look and act until they go into their murderous rampages. What also hits home about the movie is that Bill Paxton, who directed as well as stared in the movie, gives the unfortunate and helpless victims of Dad Meiks's righteous anger enough screen time to where the audience can see them as human beings instead of props. Like they would be in most horror films like ""Frailty"" and you really feel and sympathize for them as the horrible acts in the movie are inflected on them by the Meiks's. Paxton also cut the action short in regards to the killing which makes them more effective then if he lingered on with gallons of gore and slow motion camera work just to shock the audience but at the expense of taking away the humanity of the people that are murdered by cutting down on their screen time just to put in those gory scenes. The movie has an ending that's truly disturbing which you have to see over again to get what the movie is trying to tell you. Unlike most films with shocks and twists, in ""Frailty"", they fit right in with the story which is why ""Frailty"" stands out like it does compared to almost all the murder and horror movies that you see today or that you've seen over the years.",Frailty

27,dromasca,The Demons Are Among Us,7,23 April 2003,"Making or watching a horror movie about crazy people is not that crazy nowadays - it must be the times, news are probably more unsane than much of the screen or literary fiction. 'Frailty' is the story of a family of serial killers who behave like a low-class American family drawn crazy by the father's religious visions. However unsane and fantastic this seems, we have heard worse in the news already.The film is worth watching, though I confess it is not exactly my genre, neither my preferred style. Bill Paxton plays the lead role, and he also directs in what seems to be his first major movie. Directing is a little bit HBO style, with a touch of X-Files. I hate story telling in the background, and this movie has a lot of it. Having children involved in the making of such a dark movie is problematic, but well, this is what the story is about... The script is interesting enough to keep interest, it has twists and surprises that compensate the conventional cinema making that dominates the movie. The final message is rather ambiguous, and I am wondering if some viewers may take it as a kind of justification for serial killing on religious basis, though this may not have been at all the intention.
Not bad, overall. 7/10 on my personal scale.",Frailty
28,ThomasDrufke,"""You're Not a Demon Are Ya?""",6,15 September 2014,"This is one of those thrillers that can be more horrifying that certain Horror films. It's also done in a way that I haven't seen many films done before. It uses it's two biggest actors in Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe and keeps them limited to very small roles and only retelling their stories. It's a crime drama thriller, but I think it's an even bigger mystery. The moment McConaughey goes to the sheriff's office confessing all these crimes were committed by his brother, you know that something had to be up.First of all McConaughey gives an unbelievably deceptive and creepy job in his role as one of the sons of a serial killer. In particular a killer who isn't just killing people for fun, he is told to kill them from an 'angel', in fact he believes everything he is doing is right. To me, those are always the most frightening kind of villains. I thought Bill Paxton did a solid job not only in the father/serial killer role but also in the directors chair. The film is intense and definitely gripping, but I didn't quite understand the point of it all. To me it's crime dramas like Se7en or Gone Baby Gone that leave a lasting image in your mind and are truly thought provoking. But after watching Frailty, all I found myself doing was thinking about how disturbing that film was. Perhaps that's all the film was meant to do. But I would have hoped for a more meaningful film.Major props goes out to the child actors, I think both Adam and Fenton were brilliantly portrayed. It was just too disturbing watching the children have to sit through brutal murders day after day. This is where I wish the film had gone. I would have liked that childhood to be the first half of the film and then the second half showing how destroyed, no pun intended, their lives were because of this wicked father they grew up with.Brian Tyler's score was a highlight though. It was original and very dark. But it couldn't save the film for just being decent if not forgettable. Perhaps the only thing the film has going for it is reminding us at how talented McConaughey can be when given the right material to work with. Overall it's an insanely disturbing film that could have been in the conversation with Se7en or other classic crime dramas if it had gone even further.+McConaughey +Intense, edge of your seat drama +Tyler's score +Child actors performances -Almost too disturbing at times -What was the deeper meaning and point to all of it? -Story could have followed the sons futures 6.6/10",Frailty

30,secondtake,"Badly acted, simplistic plot, cliché after cliché--skip this. Skip it!",5,5 March 2017,"Frailty (2001)A psychological morie about a murderer that is so filled with clichés and idiocit plot contrivances (and terrible editing and direction), it's hard to watch. Bill Paxton is the lead psycho, and he's a cardboard idea of a psychotic killer. Stereotypes of evil and the craziness of religious extremists abound.Matthew McConaughey is young here, and good in a serious kind of way, though his part is restricted as a kind of troubled child who is now an adult with a story to tell. The detective he is ""confessing"" to is Powers Boothe, a bit over his head in the part, which demands that detective kind of tenacity and cleverness that gets under the skin of the killer. It doesn't quite click.Women do not appear in the movie, to speak of. There are men and there are boys, in two time periods (the 70s and around 2000, I think). I found it all simplistic and sometimes badly put together.Who's to blame? Ah, back to Bill Paxton, the director, who directed just two movies, and this is his first. It feels like a first try—he's no Orson Welles—and if some see the awkwardness as a kind of campy style, it strikes me more as bordering on stupid. It depends on overdone sound effects that rush on you in a shock, and that have the two sons (as boys) watching the mayhem with a kind of dumbed down confusion.I wish it would build on the psychological layers it presents. I wish the acting was convincing rather than exaggerated in a ""style"" that wears thin fast. I wish the plot was more than just the killings of a father and the misgivings of two different sons. The falseness throughout reminds me of other movies that have no intention at ""invisibility"" (in movie-making terms). An odd comparison (in terms of style and production) is ""A Christmas Story,"" which of course has nothing else in common except the rising up of style over content. In this case it's dead serious, and as such, there's little wiggle room.I'm not a bit religious, but I found the dumbing down of some religious conservative view of the world almost insulting, as well. The sad thing is that the movie has the bones of being good. The idea of a son seeing a bad dad has to have resonance with many, and then taking revenge in an appropriate twist is justified, too. It could have been about God and parenting and being young in a confusing world, but it's so filled with reductions and exaggerations I couldn't for a minute buy in. A pushy movie that borders on bad, no matter what its reputation and rating. One small proof—watch Paxton in his final moment. Isn't that a definition of bad acting?",Frailty
31,sol-,Visions,8,30 September 2017,"Trying to convince an FBI agent that his brother is a wanted notorious serial killer, a mysterious young man recounts how his father had divine visions and went on a killing spree when he was a kid in this compelling mystery thriller. While Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe are second and third billed as the mysterious young man and FBI agent respectively, the majority of the film actually takes place in flashback with Matt O'Leary turning in an intense performance as a young boy trying his best to deal with his father's murder spree and ravings of visions and messages from angels. There is not a lot of overt horror here (most of the killings occur off-screen) but 'Frailty' soon becomes a deeply disturbing movie - in the best possible way - as we see how helpless O'Leary is, made an unwilling participant in the killings and tortured by his father when he refuses to comply. An uncanny series of twist after twist towards the end of the movie cheapens this power struggle somewhat, however, 'Frailty' still remains an enticing movie overall with its depiction of an uneasy father/son relationship. The twists are thought-provoking too, even if they do not necessarily gel with child abuse and rebellion themes, and set to an unsettling music score, 'Frailty' is such a classy film that it makes one really wish that Bill Paxton directed more films before his untimely passing.",Frailty

Now, enlisting his two young boys, the dad (Paxton) kidnaps strangers and dispatches them with mounting grotesquerie. One may say Paxton doesn't shy from cheap thrills. This film takes the endangered-child device to new depths of queasiness or gross deception. His manipulativeness, layered with foggy atmospherics, at first stirs a disorienting ambiguity but soon degenerates into tedious misdirection. Frailty tends to drag in far too much with the flashback scenes and takes way from the film overall. Although the ending is something quite amusing, although a tad bit predictable, as it could have been more thought out and layered (5/10).As a rewatch 07.24.19' with more attention to detail, Frailty is much better on another viewing. Having mostly forgotten about the film in its entirety and it's twists on the second viewing, can see as to why this film is praised. It is quite slow and it is mainly told in flashbacks but the story is quite intriguing, and the ending twist isn't completely predictable.

36,jtindahouse,Thrillers were so great back then,8,19 November 2016,"Thrillers were very different 15 years ago. Back in the late 90s, early 2000s there were a raft of terrific thrillers being released all the time. They were dark in nature, excellently made and smart in their writing. Unfortunately, these days finding films like 'Frailty' is a rare thing. It's a fantastic movie, that while flawed in parts, is everything a good thriller should be. I wish Hollywood would return to the trend of making these types of movies in abundance. They're just so much fun to watch.There are two twists in Frailty, one reasonably obvious, the other not so. The first twist comes in the form of Matthew McConaughey's character not being everything he appears to be. The exact implication of who is character really is, is a worthy twist, but the fact that he's not all he seemed to be is far from it. The second twist is the real doozy though. I kept thinking to myself throughout the film that this story line, and Bill Paxton's character in particular, were making religious people look absolutely awful. Now, knowing that McConaughey is himself a very religious person, it surprised me that he would take on a role in movie that would make his people seem so despicable. That's why the second twist made so much to me. I really liked that, it gave a film an extra layer. I read that Stephen King was a big fan of this movie and I can understand why - that twist is right up his alley.This was Bill Paxton's directorial debut. I thought he did a fairly good job. You could tell he was working on a very tight budget at times, and that just makes his performance even more admirable. The real surprise for me came when I looked up the writer of the film Brent Hanley to find this was his one and only film, and the only other thing he has worked on since was by far the best 'Masters of Horror' episode 'Family'. Why is this man not writing more? A terrible waste of an obviously huge talent.'Frailty' is an excellent film with terrific performances and an outstanding ending to cap it all off. The only flaws for me come in the form of not quite enough attention given to hide the first twist, and the unfortunate necessity of having an incredibly annoying character (Paxton's) taking up a majority of the screen time. Other than that there's nothing not to like here. If you missed this on its original release take the time to go back and find it. You won't regret doing so.",Frailty
37,Polaris_DiB,It was exactly five minutes too long,3,8 July 2006,"One night, a man appears in FBI headquarters saying that he knows who ""The God's Hand Killer"" is. After sitting down with the head of that particular department, he tells his story about his father and brother, and the events that surrounded his father's sudden acquirement of Godly duties from an angel. It is the job of the family to hunt down and destroy demons.The movie that follows would be a very intense and interesting look into the way one father's insanity affects his young and impressionable children, and the damaging results that follow. Instead it's actually a reinforcement of the father's own insanity, eventually leading itself to unnecessary and counter-intuitive plot twists that are camp when taken not seriously and preachy when taken seriously.Overall the general stylings of the film are okay. The directing, acting, and cinematography are well-enough done, though the acting tends to shudder sometimes towards bad, especially during the end. None of it really seems to hold itself together by the end, when the film just decides to be stupid. Even then it had a moment to save itself, but then it went on for exactly five more minutes and ruined itself again, so I for once I can say about a movie, ""It was exactly five minutes too long."" --PolarisDiB",Frailty

39,ackstasis,"A superb, often-overlooked psychological thriller.",8,5 November 2006,"'Frailty,' Bill Paxton's directorial debut, opened quietly to a small audience back in 2001. Whilst receiving moderately good reviews from critics, the film made few waves, despite being one of the best thrillers to hit theatres in recent times.The story opens with a mysterious man named Fenton Mieks (Matthew McConaughey, 'U-571,' 2000) approaching FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth, 'Sin City,' 2005), claiming to know the identity of a merciless serial murderer dubbed the God's Hand Killer. Fenton explains to a skeptical Agent Doyle that his brother, Adam, who had just committed suicide, is responsible for the murders. He traces the killings to their beginning, when Fenton and Adam lived happily with their loving father (Bill Paxton, 'Aliens,' 1986).In the early hours of the morning, their father claims to have been visited by an angel of God, declaring that he and his children have been given the task of tracking down and ""destroying"" evil demons. A young Fenton (Matt O'Leary) recognises that his father has quite obviously become insane, and is devastated when his father brings home ordinary-looking strangers to be ""destroyed;"" their names taken from a divinely-written list. This deeply-disturbing film is filled with stunning visual imagery, and Paxton's barn house discovery of an axe and gloves (with which he can ""destroy"" demons) demonstrates such imagery poignantly.The acting is very good, with the two child actors turning in particularly impressive performances, especially O'Leary. A taut religious and psychological thriller, 'Frailty' masterfully allows the viewer, through young Fenton's eyes, to trace his father's continuing descent into insanity, and his own torturous dilemma between societal morals and family loyalty.",Frailty
40,dee.reid,Blurring the lines between reality and fantasy,10,9 December 2002,"The movie ""Frailty"" is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film.  It has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not.  ""Frailty"" is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong.In ""Frailty"", a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to be doing the work of God.  It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called ""God's Hands"".  We watch the father kill the ""demons"" in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work God and that what they are doing is right.  He claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth.  God has given him a list of names and in return for his ""services""; he and his sons will be given protection, which basically means the police will never be able to capture them.  We see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner. But what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons, particularly the oldest son, Adam.  Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that.  He knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother, Fenton.  Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything in as if it were his own religion.  He seems trapped in his father's world of God and demons.  I suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable. But everything that happens to these three is rather convincing, in fact, TOO convincing.  The events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters.  I say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see God.  Dad first sees the murders as his mission.  His ""mission"" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons.  In fact, his hallucination is the primary one.  His ""orders"" and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination.  Watch the scene where Dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where I am coming from.  Fenton, the younger son, is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction.  Since he is so young, it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap.  Adam, on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions. ***SPOILERS*** In a way, the hallucination ends when Dad is killed towards the end of the movie.  (I will not say how or under what circumstances).  But I will say that it is not pleasant.  After his death, it fast-forwards to the present day.  (The story is being told through flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the oldest son Adam).  In actuality, it is Fenton that is telling the story, not Adam as originally believed.  The story is being told the way he perceived it, through his actions and his brother's actions.  Fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the FBI agent into his trap.Since religion is a major theme in this movie, the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it.  Before Dad discovered his newfound mission, he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being.  His sons Fenton and Adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant.  After the revelation of Dad's newfound mission, they both took off in separate directions - Adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while Fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness.  A very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you, do not watch it alone.",Frailty
41,meeza,"Verdict: ""Frailty"" not failty for Paxton",9,2 March 2003,"Actor Bill Paxton has tried his first hand at direction with a thriller named `Frailty'.

Would this be a successful debut venture named `Frailty' or a suicidal demonic career shift named `Failty' for Paxton? I must agree with the former instead of the latter. ""Frailty' is the best thriller of the year! It stars Paxton & Matthew Mconaughey as a father & son who are ordered by god to commit murders in a small texas town in order to abolish demons. Paxton's directorial techniques of past to present shifting, unpredictability sequencing, and story machination were glorified achievements for the seasoned actor.  `Frailty' is a present reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock film. So do not let those few negative review demons of `Frailty' fool you. I might not be God, but I order to you to get rid of them and have a heavenly time observing `Frailty'. ***** Excellent",Frailty
42,MBunge,I'm really glad my adolescence was nothing like Fenton Meeks',8,20 September 2010,"There have been a lot of coming-of-age films made. Some of them have been sweet, some sad and some wistful. Frailty is probably the most terrifying and unsettling coming-of-age movie of all time, a near brilliant perspective on just how jarring and awful the transition from child to adult can beand how that journey doesn't always end up in the place we want it to.On a rainy night in Dallas, a man calling himself Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into FBI headquarters and insists on seeing the agent in charge of the search for the God's Hand killer. Fenton tells FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) that the serial murderer is Fenton's brother. Doyle is understandably dubious. In his law enforcement experience, people don't just walk in and tell you who the killer is. So Fenton has to explain it to him. He tells Doyle the story of his childhood, how young Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and his three years younger brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) were happy living behind the public rose garden in Thurman, Texas with their mechanic father (Bill Paxton). At least they were happy, until their father walked into the boys' room and told them he'd been visited by an angel and given a holy mission to destroy demons in the world.Dad tells Fenton and Adam that God has given him a list of people who aren't people and will command him to exterminate them using a metal pipe, a pair of work gloves and an ax with the name Otis carved into the handle. And it's not just Dad's job. Fenton and Adam are to help as well. At first, Fenton tries to deny what's happened to his family. But when he sees his dad out by the shed in the middle of the night with a woman bound and gagged at his feet, Fenton can't deny it any longer. Dad claims that when he touches these people their demonic nature is revealed and young Adam, seemingly caught up in his father's madness, claims he sees that too. All Fenton sees is innocent people being butchered by his father. Adult Fenton tells Agent Doyle that he tried everything he could think of to stop the killings, but Agent Doyle knows there's something Fenton isn't telling him. Something shocking and unbelievable. Something Fenton has to show Agent Doyle so he can truly understand the story of the Meeks family.Frailty is very smartly written, well acted and looks really good. The story cleverly blends a child's loss of innocence with the more mature concept of falling away from God and ties it all up in chains of Gothic horror. It eschews cheap scare tactics in favor of a pervasive sense of dread that flows under even the sunniest of circumstances. There's a quiet strength to all of the performances, particularly Matt O'Leary. The fear and conflict he shows in Fenton when his father, the center of his existence, apparently transforms into a murderous lunatic feels deep and true. His struggle to escape this impossible, insane situation is as frightening as any of Dad's ax murders. Bill Paxton also does some impressive work, letting the audience see just enough of the father's humanity to make him relatable but still giving him a frightening unknowability. Paxton's direction is just as impressive. He bestows upon the movie a leisurely pace, like a more normal coming-of-age story, which only emphasizes the creepiness and unease of this bizarre tale. Paxton demonstrates a fine visual sense as well, crafting scenes of such awful normality that they're scarier than the blood-drenched slaughterfests of a thousand lesser films.Frailty is a dark and violent movie. However, there is very little gore and not even that much bad language. There's virtually nothing about this movie that is exploitative or sensational, in the worst sense of that word. It's not simply content to stoke the baser emotions, but aspires to provoke an intellectual uncertainty that's much harder to shake. Most horror films are aimed at teenagers and relatively stupid teenagers at that. This is a horror movie for grown ups and I highly recommend it.",Frailty
43,jimbo-53-186511,Doing God's Work,6,25 April 2015,"Fenton Meiks (Matthew McCoanughey) enters the headquarters of The FBI asking to speak to Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe). Meiks claims that a member of his family was the person responsible for the so called 'God's hands' killings which have remained unsolved for several years. Doyle initially appears content that he is now in a position to solve a case that has left him frustrated for years, but not everything is as it seems.There are quite a number of problems with this picture and the first notable problem is its rather unimaginative and clichéd plot line. Here we have a serial killer that is instructed to kill people because God is telling him to - how original? Had this been the only problem it would have only been a minor irritation, but what makes it worse is how heavy-handed the whole film is. We're told that God is telling our killer to go after these demons and the writers kindly remind you of this fact about every 3 minutes... you know just in case you forget. Whatever happened to subtlety? The worst aspect of all of this is when you see Bill Paxton putting his hand on the 'demons' heads in order to be able to see all their various indiscretions, murders etc. I mean seriously? I thought this was supposed to be a serious thriller, not a fantasy film. Once I realised how silly it was becoming, I really had a hard time taking it seriously.The script is sloppy and silly at times, but thankfully many of the actors are good here and do at least lend some much needed gravitas to proceedings. The ever reliable Bill Paxton is always a good presence and he's supported well by both Powers Boothe and Matthew McConaughey. Frailty is also well-paced, reasonably compelling and it also has a few disturbing and creepy moments.Ultimately, this is a good film, but it would have been a much better film had it not been so heavy with the 'God' stuff - it really didn't need to be this 'agenda-heavy'. However, it does have some strengths and generally the film just about does enough to cover up for some of its weaknesses.",Frailty

I especially like the performances of the kids, Paxton's at his best and powers booth only gives great performances.

45,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Stunningly well made southern Gothic chiller,9,30 August 2015,"Frailty is the kind of eerie film that starts slow, and before you know it has crawled right under your skin and scared you in the unsettling way that freezes your blood. It's an unconventionally drawn horror, and the directing debut of Bill Paxton, who also stars. He plays a loving single father in the 60's, to two young sons, Adam (Jeremy Sumpter), and Fenton (Matt O Leary). The story is told by the adult version of Fenton (Matthew Mconaughey) to a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). When they were still very young, their father went through a disturbing change: one day, he comes home and tells them that he has been visited by an Angel, who tells him that he has been chosen to kill demons, who have taken human shape, and only he can see. The Angels gave him special weapons to kill the, too.... An axe and a lead pipe. Younger Adam is too mentally undeveloped to understand that his dad isn't playing with a full deck anymore and goes along with the plan, but Fenton realizes something is off and refuses to take part, resulting in his father shunning him. There some scenes where Paxton carries out his delusional crusade right in front of his sons that will give nightmares, but Paxton doesn't compromise, directing with a steady, unflinching eye that captures the unspeakable horror in vivid strokes. He solidly plays the dad too, completely deluded and nuts, but still the caring, loving father, gently trying to make Fenton and Adam understand his quest in some chilling exchanges of dialogue that make you wince to the bone. Sumpter and O Leary are thrown into impossibly tough scenes for kids their age, but handle them perfectly. Mconaughey is a laconic wonder in the present day scenes, with some dark, burning secrets, and delivers the tale in a way where we're sure as hell paying attention. Boothe is a low key growler as Doyle the agent who patiently listens, and may have a few secrets of his own. Now, there's a huge third act twist, that some say is a huge cop out and sucks away all of the dark energy and nightmarish atmosphere that came before it. I don't think it's that damaging the film. It's certainly a revelation, and while does drastically change characters motivations and the central mystery itself, add to the labyrinthine nature of the plot, and certainly makes you think. Either way it's a hell of a movie, just prepare to be disturbed and unsettled.",Frailty
46,drownnnsoda,"""May God welcome you""",8,30 April 2015,"In rural Texas, a man contacts an FBI agent claiming to know the identity of the ""God's Hand"" killer, an unknown serial murderer who claimed victims beginning in 1979, and has recently had a second insurgence. He recounts his disturbed childhood, detailing his father's belief that he, himself, and his brother were chosen by God to eradicate the ""demons"" on earth.This neo-Biblical thriller features Bill Paxton as director and actor, and garnered a great deal of critical attention in 2001, especially after being lauded by Stephen King. As Paxton's directorial debut, ""Frailty"" is impressive. It is an unabashedly dark film, rife with theological substance and mythological backing that we are initially made to question as human psychology gone awry— is dad just a madman with an axe, or is God really speaking to him? What does it have to do with faith at all? Because of this, the film has the potential to be a bit divisive— especially with its unquestionable conclusion— but taken as spiritual creed or contemporary myth, the film is enjoyable all the same.Phenomenal performances from then-child actors Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter really boost the film, as both of them play the childhood brothers who are detrimental to the unfolding narrative. The bulk of the film rests on their shoulders, with Matthew McConaughey providing the narrative frame, and Powers Boothe as the disbelieving FBI agent. As I mentioned before, the conclusion of the film is a divisive one, but no matter what your theological standpoint, ""Frailty"" is an eloquent and well-photographed thriller that meshes Biblical overtones with the contemporary serial killer film to surprising results. Well-acted, suspenseful, and fascinating on all counts. 8/10.",Frailty

Sure, sometimes it was a little pretentious, but the mood and tension that built up during the film was exceptional. Bill Paxton is still a good actor, but at least he has something to fall back on in the near future. But what really made this film was the performance of Matthew McConahay (or however you spell his damn name). A good film to watch at night.",Frailty
49,rbverhoef,Interesting and with suspense,9,22 June 2003,"A father (Bill Paxton) wakes his two young boys one night claiming he had a vision of an angel. God has ordered him and his two sons to destroy demons. Not much later the father gets a list with the first seven names of demons that must be destroyed. The youngest son Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) follows and believes his father from the start, the older one Fenton (Matthew O'Leary) does not believe a thing. The story is told by one of the two boys when he is grown up (and played by Matthew McConaughey) and sitting in front of FBI agent Wesley Doyle. He claims to know who the killer is the FBI is searching for at that moment.Thus movie has moments with suspense and with drama. When that father brings one of his demons home he put off his gloves to touch the person and see their crimes. We don't know if he has gone mad or is telling the truth but when he touches the ""demon"" he really sees something. He destroys this people with an ax while both children are watching and he gets away with it every time. The movie is not really saying anything but it has scenes in it implying that his acts are really ordered by God. The movie is very interesting, with some nice twist in the movie. You never really know what is next although some things are a little expected. One of those predictable scenes is followed by another one totally unpredictable. With great suspense and an intelligent story to talk about this directional debut from Bill Paxton is definitely worth watching.",Frailty
50,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Thriller That Makes You Question What You See,10,1 July 2020,"This was a film that I remember seeing the case in the Favorites section when I worked at Family Video and one of my favorite podcasters, Mr. Watson, talked very highly of this film. That was the reason I saw this movie the first time. I then showed it to Jaime as it fell in one of my years for The Podcast Under the Stairs Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The official synopsis is a man confesses to an FBI agent his family's story of how his religious fanatic father's visions led to a series of murders to destroy supposed 'demons'.As many of you know, stories of films are what I look for most and this film has an excellent one. This film combines a couple of my favorite elements together. The first is that we have a man who believes that angels and God have spoken to him. We never learn his real name, just that he goes by Dad (Bill Paxton). What I like about this is that for a majority of the film, we don't know if he is really seeing the things that he claims or if there is some kind of mental illness. Going even farther though is that a majority of this film is told by his elder son, Fenton Meiks (Matt O'Leary). The young Fenton thinks his father is making it up and the people that are being brought to their home are normal and are being murdered. The younger son Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) believes that his father is telling the truth. I chalked most of this up to naivety from the look of his age.Now if you know me personally, I do not follow organized religion. I don't fault anyone who does, but personally I don't agree with it. I do believe that some people with mental illness can use it like it is in the film. I'm not saying that is the only way to read this film, but definitely it is something that can be seen in real life. This film does present its story in a great way. It is being told by Matthew McConaughey to an FBI Agent, Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe). He is trying to convince him that Adam is the Hand of God killer they are looking for. To build tension, Agent Doyle doesn't believe him, but does allow him to tell his story. The deeper he gets into it, the more Agent Doyle considers it could be real. There's also a great duality here where as a boy, Fenton brought the sheriff of their town to show him what his father was doing and in the present, this same offer is made.This film has a great twist and reveal at the end in my opinion, which I did see the reveal coming around halfway through. Jaime did make a joke about it as well, but was shocked at how it played out from our discussion after the film. I was impressed with the story and how it unfolds overall. There is also some little thing during the ending that I liked as it really set the film apart in my eyes. It is a reference back to something earlier in the movie which I'm a sucker for. Something else people might not like it as it narrated with voice-over throughout most of it, so I should point that out here.Going from this would be the editing of the film, which I thought was good. The film is presented with giving us some details on the killer and then we really get into the story when McConaughey comes in to speak to Agent Doyle. I like that to break it up we come back to the present. We also get to see McConaughey gauging to see if Doyle believes him or not. There's a tension between the two.For a film like this, the acting was very important. First I need to give credit to Paxton. He also directed this film. His role is great, because we establish he is just a normal guy. When he starts to talk of his plan, we immediately think he is crazy. We do get a scene of a vision he sees, then nothing. He plays this so well that he believes what he is seeing so it is hard to fault Adam for believing. McConaughey also does a great job in this film. Boothe was really good for what was needed from him. I also want to commend both O'Leary and Sumpter. They are children actors in this and I think they do a solid job, especially O'Leary. I was impressed overall.For effects, there really aren't used. The blood in the film was practical and looked good on the actors. There are a couple of visions that are shown, but they are done in a way that look surreal, but aren't CGI. It works well though as we question if this is really happening or not. I had no issues here and thought that the effects were good for what they needed.The soundtrack of the film was also something that was good. Now it isn't one that is going to make one of my favorites list. It fit the scenes and helped to build the tension. It never took me out of the film, so it succeeds in my opinion for what was needed.Now with that said, I would recommend this film if you've never seen it. I thought the story is so deep and has a couple different ways of reading it. Even at the ending it gives some additional things that I thought really set it apart there. It is edited very well also. It builds tension to the climax, which I thought was satisfying. The acting is right up there with the story as one of the strongest parts of this film. I mean this across the board. The effects looked real, but there weren't a lot used. The soundtrack was also good for what they needed as well; it helps to build tension for the scenes. This film I thought was great and would recommend this to horror fans and to non-fans of the genre as well.",Frailty
51,robertemerald,Well constructed chiller,8,30 June 2020,"Three factors make sure Frailty rises above average horror. Firstly the powerful presence of Matthew McConaughey lends gravitas essential to the arc. Secondly the fact that the main bulk of the story is about two small boys in crisis with their father sort of doubles the horror. Seeing things from a child's perspective is chilling and amplifies the horror. Thirdly, this is an unusual story. There's an air of Stephen King about this. I'm thinking Pet Cemetery. Frailty has many less characters than your average Stephen King, though the production is equally as good, perhaps better. Frailty is a great horror watch even now, nearly 20 years on. I watched it just now and I was glued. Great work.",Frailty
52,Backlash007,"""The angel called us God's Hands.""",10,22 April 2003,"~Spoiler~ I love a good, down-n-dirty, gorefest.  Who doesn't?  But every now and then it comes time to sit down, get serious, and get involved.  Frailty is the thinking man's horror movie, and it's the best to come along in years.  It's all about the story.  To quote the movie: ""Nothing that crazy can be real."" Or could it?  Penned by a newcomer and directed by an actor, Frailty probably shouldn't have been this good.  Paxton rises to the challenge, however, and delivers the goods.  Despite others' opinions, I'm glad he plays the lead and I think he's as remarkable as ever.  The other actors are impeccable as well.  Matthew McConaughey is very understated here.  He's real calm and quiet.  And Powers Boothe just has a presence about him that doesn't get used very often.  Most times I will watch a movie simply for a particular actor.  That's not the case here.  I think I would have loved Frailty had these names been absent.  It's just deliciously rich storytelling.  A seemingly normal family man (Paxton) wakes in the dead of night and tells his children that he was visited by an angel and it's God's will that they destroy demons.  Only, the demons look like ordinary people. But that's not the scary part.  What if he wasn't insane?  What if he is doing God's will?  That's the creepy part.  It definitely makes for an entertaining and thought-provoking hour and a half.  The film should have been titled ""Subtlety"" because there are a lot of things you miss the first time around.  The next couple of times you spend watching Frailty are completely different experiences than that first viewing.  Easily one of my favorites (especially since it mentions The Warriors).

53,Sherazade,Scary,7,2 October 2009,"This movie was scary, thought-provoking, shocking and just really really out there. I mean, I dare anyone to tell me that they could guess the ending. I sort of started to figure it out by the time the dad took the boys to the house of the wife-abuser but I could never have guessed the surprise twist in the tale. I'm just glad that it all made sense in the end because it was really kind of weird for me to have been thinking one thing the whole movie long only to be made to change my belief at the last minute. I guess where children are involved you can never be too sure because we all tend to think with our hearts and not our heads. Overall, I think it was very well cast, very well-acted and achieved what it wanted to with its audience. It's a cross between Stephen King's 'Storm of the Century' and 'The Mist.'",Frailty
54,rosscinema,Good job of directing by Paxton,7,28 April 2003,"Bill Paxton makes his directorial debut with this film and its a fairly impressive effort. In fact, when you get done watching you definitely want Paxton to direct again! Story is about a man who wakes his two sons up in the middle of the night to tell them that an angel visited him and has told him to kill demons that are in our society. They look like regular people but when he touches them he receives a sensation that tells him they are demons. Bill Paxton plays the father Meiks and the two sons Adam and Fenton are played by Jeremy Sumpter and Matthew O'Leary. Fenton seems to think that his father might be right but Adam does not. He thinks his father has gone insane and at one point tries to to tell the sheriff (Luke Askew) but to no avail. Meiks finally locks Adam in the cellar for days until he starts being more cooperative toward him and his mission from the angel. Film actually starts with Matthew McConaughey playing the adult Adam and its a rainy night when he walks into the office of FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe). Adam starts to tell him the story of his father because Doyle has been working on the case for years trying to solve the serial killings that has plagued the area for years. Film then is told mainly in flashbacks. Paxton does a great service by being faithful to the script and not allowing it to be a gore-fest. Meiks uses an ax to kill his victims but they're really is very little blood in the film. Instead, Paxton makes sure the focal point is targeted at the relationship of the two sons and how they both react differently towards their father when these events start. Paxton also makes sure the viewer cannot be sure if Meiks is correct or not. Did an angel visit him that night? At times during the film we're not sure. The films cinematographer is the great Bill Butler (Jaws) and he adds some excellent shots to this low budget film. In one scene McConaughey and Boothe are suppose to be in a car driving at night in the rain but in reality its on a sound stage. But Butler has these good shots of the wetness streaking down the window and it creates these lines that come across the characters faces in shadows. It really creates a dark and creepy mood in the film. They're is a sort of twist ending but I was not that surprised when it was played out. Its not quite ""The Sixth Sense"" but its still a little jolt! Paxton does such a good job pacing the film evenly that I was reminded of (Do I dare say it?) Hitchcock. If another director with less patience and maturity had directed this film then it would have been another splatter film. But Paxton does have the patience and maturity and the result is a film steered by someone who doesn't undermine the intelligence of the viewer.",Frailty

It mixes real with imaginary and maybe even the dreamt, the fantastic and the unreal in a unclear way which puts it halfway between a horror movie and a crime or a fantastic one giving us no clues to realize what specific kind of movie are we watching. It looks like the screen-play writer wanted to combine all these kinds in one movie but the ingredients of each kind don't combine in a clear conducting wire coming not up the writer's intention. A man goes to see a FBI agent who is investigating a serial of murders whose author has never been found till then. He tells the agent that his dead brother was the author of all those killings. From then on the story develops itself in successive intercalated flashback scenes which from a certain moment on begin to reveal little credibility and get even into a confusion of identities and stories. The final is inconclusive and incomplete, leaving lots of doubts behind. Nevertheless the acting and the directing are rather good which makes them wasted in such a poor story.",Frailty
57,sme_no_densetsu,Atmospheric Southern Gothic from first-time director Bill Paxton,8,12 March 2017,"""Frailty"" is a movie that's somewhat difficult to pin down. It contains many elements of horror but it shows more intelligence & restraint than most films of that type. It also functions as an enthralling crime drama with a compelling central mystery. Lastly, the story is enveloped in a palpable atmosphere of Southern Gothic.Set in Bill Paxton's home state of Texas, ""Frailty"" begins with a man claiming to know the identity of the so-called ""God's Hand"" serial killer. Naturally, his claim is met with skepticism by the FBI agent in charge of the case. So, he begins to unravel the story of his family's supposed mission from God, taking us back twenty years into the past...The bulk of the movie occurs in flashback with Matthew McConaughey relating his family's experiences to Powers Boothe, who plays the FBI agent. Both Texans, McConaughey & Boothe were ideally suited to these roles. Due to the narrative approach, McConaughey's performance brings to mind ""True Detective"", which certainly isn't a bad thing. In the flashback sequences, Bill Paxton plays the father who believes he has received a mission from God. He acquitted himself well in a challenging role that demanded that he come across as both morally upright & mentally unhinged. The two young actors who portrayed his sons - Matt O'Leary & Jeremy Sumpter - both did well alongside Paxton, contributing mainly naturalistic performances.Paxton's first-time direction is nicely handled, even though I think that he might have gotten carried away a couple of times. Most importantly, the suspense is expertly controlled, which makes the story that much more compelling. The chilling music by Brian Tyler also played a crucial role in establishing the film's overall atmosphere.""Frailty"" is a sleeper of a movie that deserves a wider audience. Here, Bill Paxton showed himself capable as both director and star. Add in Matthew McConaughey & Powers Boothe plus a smart, gripping script and you've got a sure-fire winner for fans of understated horror & Southern Gothic-tinged crime dramas.",Frailty
58,punishmentpark,An American Gothic.,8,6 December 2013,"I was in the mood to try this American Gothic (Bill Paxton's own words, if I remember correctly from a DVD-commentary) once again, and it remains a remarkable chiller. Crucial is that Bill Paxton plays the father (who else could have put such a humane face to such deeply disturbed individual?), and also the young actors playing Fenton and Adam. The framework around the story about Doyle I found to be less interesting, even it was probably meant to make it just that (or is 'entertaining' the right word there?).There are people here (on IMDb) who have a big problem with the ending when it turns out that the visions are real and Daddy and Adam turn out to be right... well, if you believe in the simple - originally biblical, also - 'an eye for an eye' credo without exceptions. Granted, I could easily féél that way, too (in a way this could even be considered a vigilante movie), but rationally it is certainly not the best option (though America differs quite a bit from Holland when comparing justice systems...), and bypassing the courts of the country they live in... I suppose we could get into this for about two or three pages, but: that's not what this movie is really about for me. It's a film that I looked at as a supernatural horror with a strong human factor, meaning that the story may surely touch on all sorts of subjects, but is mainly chillingly entertaining and takes you into a world all its own. An 'American Gothic' indeed, where one should - I do - try and find its meaning in the original term Gothic created for the European architectural style, which is overly stylish in a way (originally the term Gothic was used as a derogatory term, but you can look all that up); 'Frailty' is exuberant in its dark style and execution (check the Hitchcock reference, the rainy car windows, the beautiful, but obvious settings like Thurman Rose Garden) and the human, but deeply eerie conundrums that the characters are facing (again, I didn't care too much for the story of Doyle and older Adam, but hey) completes that.All in all, there would have been room for improvement, but not much.

60,Maciste_Brother,Yeah. Sure. Okay. Right. Uh-huh,1,24 May 2005,"I avoided FRAILTY when it was released at the movies and home video. The whole thing just didn't inspire me to check it out. But then one night, the movie was being shown on some channel and I decided to watch it. Wow, my initial instinct was spot on. FRAILTY is a *t e r r i b l e* film. The story is so repulsive (and yet silly) that I felt queasy after watching it.The idea for FRAILTY is not that different than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER or the demon killing witches on CHARMED: a father is told to kill demons after seeing a vision (which is one of the funniest scenes I've ever witnessed in a movie...) and involves his two boys in his quest to rid the earth of those evil being. From the sound of it, the story seems to be fun (""I didn't know the bible endorsed killing demons. Cool!"") but what sets this film apart from those fun TV shows is the super creepy attitude and point-of-view of the director (who's one of the main actors) which turns this somewhat familiar story into a scary ""message"" picture with extremely dubious intentions. I won't go into these ""intentions"" because it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence and common sense.The funny part of this repulsive picture is that it takes itself very seriously and yet the whole story is so ridiculous and is filled with so many holes that it just adds so much more weirdness to it all. It's as if the whole project was designed by some sort of religious cult where logic usually never exist. I mean, yeah, the father got a vision from god telling him to kill demons and then proceeds to kill those demons, which seem to be quite a LOT in that tiny corner of the world. They keep killing people left and right, including a family member(!) and yet no one seems to figure out why there are so many demons in that neck of the woods (arf!) and the fact that they can only do their work in a limited area makes me wonder: are there any other demon-killing rednecks in the southern states or it's just them?Was this film produced by Jack and Rexella Van Impe?Anyway, the whole thing is just so stupid. Avoid at all cost!",Frailty
61,gedikreverdi,It was good although I kinda saw the twist coming,7,12 December 2020,Adam and Fenton live with their mechanic father and one day their father says he's seeing vision from god and starts to make a list of demons. One day late at night he brought a nurse late at night and axed him with the axe Otis in the shed. Then Fenton was very suspicious but can't talk to the police as he loves his dad no matter what. Then they hunted an old man and killed him too. Dad wanted him to dig a big hole and turned that hole into a cellar under the shed that's transferred onto it. In the shed dad wanted him to kill a man but he ran away to the station and brought sheriff with him to confess about dads killings. The sherif was not believing either but dad killed him too in the cellar and he was buried in the rose garden too. After that as a punishment he locked up Fenton in the cellar until he believes. His brother gave him water thru the hole and after he doesn't speak his dad took him out of the hole and fed him and was very happy with Fenton saying he saw God. And then it was fentons turn to kill. They picked a tall man from his home and brought him in the cellar as the first killing of Fenton. But Fenton killed his dad instead and his brother Adam killed the guy. Both were buried. We listened to this story from Fentons confession to the police now. And they arrived to the rose garden and he turns out to be Adam who believes his da visions and they were true. He touched the police officer and sees he killed his mother too and buries him in the rose garden as well the other demons including his brother Fenton who was killed in his home while typing. Adam plants the evidence in his home and he becomes the killer. At the end Fenton appears as the new sheriff in town and his wife as his secretary knowing he's the demon killer. The twist was a bit too obvious but the movie overall good although it felt a lot older than 2001.,Frailty

63,mattymatt4ever,"Creepy, genuinely effective horror/thriller",7,27 May 2003,"I compliment Bill Paxton for a kick-butt directorial debut!  The film has a good, original premise with echoes of ""Night of the Hunter.""  Paxton takes on sort of the Robert Mitchum role, as a religious fanatic who believes that God chose him to rid the demons from the world.  I'm always fascinated and amused by religious fantaticism, because it's something that cannot be exaggerated.  You can never be ""over-the-top"" in portraying religious fanatics, because these people really do invest in every hint of bullcrap they spew, and say it with a straight face.  And I'm not making assumptions, because I lived next to a family of religious fanatics for nine years when I was back in Brooklyn.Paxton was obviously going for gothic horror.  I was never truly scared, but I was creeped out.  This is quite a haunting film.  The plot is also rich and colorful, so this isn't one of those horror movies that depends on cheap scares to keep an audience interested.  I barely hinted at one of the plot twists, but it still came unexpected and kept me glued to the edge of my seat.The performances are good all-around.  Paxton delivers a delightfully evil, yet human performance.  It's hard to measure up to Mitchum's tour-de-force performance in ""Night of the Hunter,"" but Paxton's comes close.  Besides, I've always liked Bill Paxton, and find him memorable even in small supporting roles like the used car salesman he played in ""True Lies.""  I will never forget him for that performance!  Matthew McCoughnahey has recently faded from popularity, but is slowly gaining it back with hit films like ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.""  He's definitely more than a pretty face, and is another actor I always enjoy watching.  I've never complained about Powers Boothe, but he's never given a performance that had me jumping for joy.  His performance in this movie is definitely an exception.
Paxton worked with Sam Raimi on ""A Simple Plan,"" and he definitely owes a good deal of thanks to the Raim-meister, with whom he obviously drew inspiration from in making this creepy film.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Frailty
64,TOMASBBloodhound,Engrosing descent into fanaticism.,8,17 December 2009,"So much of Frailty works that you can't help but think that Bill Paxton really has a future as a director should he so chose. Or maybe it was just a good story, too. The writer is always the most important piece of the puzzle for my money. Paxton also stars as a widower mechanic trying to raise two young boys in 1979. Most of the family's story is told through flashbacks by Matthew McConaughy who plays one of the boys as an adult. One rainy night McConaughy turns up in the office of an FBI agent (Boothe) who is investigating the ""God's Hand"" serial killer currently terrorizing Texas. The edgy young man claims to know who the killer is. And of course if he just came right out with the name and where the bodies were stashed, then we wouldn't have our movie would we? We are taken back in time to witness the boys' father turn from an unassuming mechanic into an apparently fanatical serial killer. So much does he believe he is doing God's work by ""destroying demons"" that he forces the two boys to take part. The younger of the two enthusiastically wishes to help out, even providing a list of names of people he feels need to be offed. The older of the two is skeptical from the first moment he hears his father's plan and sees it as nothing more than murder whenever he brings home another writhing victim to be chopped up by a two-sided ax. The boy attempts to get his father to stop, eventually summoning the courage to tell the local sheriff about the killings. This, and any other resistance the boy gives has dreadful results. Eventually the boy's father informs the lad that the angels have implicated him as being a demon. Rather than kill his own son, the fanatical father attempts to purify the boy through various methods of torture and isolation. Finally, the boy claims to have seen God....The final act in this film I will leave you to experience for yourselves. Though it is a let-down, the film overall is still very much worth seeing. Wonderfully acted, the film drags you into the middle of what the reluctant son must be going through. And you really feel terrible for him as his childhood is seemingly ruined by his fanatical father. But of course, there is more going on than apparently meets the eye. And after a while it appears that God may have actually been telling people to commit acts which look like evil. The film does not preach against sinners or rail against Christians, but it may make you think a lot longer and harder about nut cases you read about in the news that claim God told them to do whatever they've done. In the end, there was just too much they tried to make us swallow in terms of twists and revelations. But getting there is quite an experience. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Frailty
65,jluis1984,Brilliant Debut by Paxton!,8,24 May 2006,"Many people consider the horror genre a mere bag of tired clichés and proved formulas, still, there are overlooked movies that prove the contrary such as this little modern gem that marks the debut of actor Bill Paxton as director. ""Frailty"" is a modest low-budget film that accomplishes more than what most of the recent big-budget horror films have done and with a very original and clever plot by also débutante Brent Hanley. This great mix of horror and suspense is a great step in Bill Paxton's promising career as a director.While a series of bizarre murders by a serial killer named ""God's Hand"" shock the nation, a man (Matthew McConaughey) goes to the FBI headquarters one rainy night claiming that his brother is the infamous killer. Interrogated by FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), the man, whose name is Fenton Meiks, begins to tell the story of his childhood in order to explain why he believes his brother Adam was responsible of the murders. And so he begins telling how when he and Adam were just kids, their father (Bill Paxton) had a religious experience and received a message from God giving them the mission to destroy demons. Fenton explains how unwillingly joined his family in a bizarre series of murders following his father's visions.At first sight ""Fraily"" is a low-budget film like the many dramas that are made for television, but in fact this film has a powerful and captivating storyline that never looses steam. It is a roller-coaster of suspense very well handled that keeps the tension always to the max. Without being explicit or too violent, the movie presents the internal hell that young Fenton (played superbly by Matt O'Leary) had to endure while following his fanatic family and the conflicts he has as he doesn't believe in God.Bill Paxton excels in direction and superbly gives an old school feeling to this character-driven horror film. With a very good pace he lets the story unfold keeping the interest and never letting the film drag for a second. It may not be the most visually impressive film, but it is a breath of fresh air against the fast-pack edition of modern horror films. The script is very well written and keeps the mystery of Fenton's father's visions to the end.The acting is top-notch, specially in the part of the kids. O'Leary is brilliant as young Fenton, who can't believe his family is killing people under the excuse of a divine task. His performance as a kid who gets carried in this nightmare is simply perfect. Jeremy Sumpter as young Adam is also very good, and even when his role is a bit smaller he is very convincing as the only one who believes in his father's mission. Paxton is great as usual and one can never say if he is insane or if he really has seen God. It is a very convincing role and together with the two kids carry the movie with power.The film is near-perfect and is a very good example that sometimes less is more. Still, the movie is a bit short and the ending feels a bit too rushed. However, it is enough to conclude this great story and is a very rewarding experience. The low-budget of the film doesn't really affect it and its realist approach makes the movie more intimate, and definitely even more haunting.""Fraily"" seems to have gone unnoticed when it came out despite having won several awards. It is a very good horror/suspense movie with an old school style that will please fans of horror tired of the constant repetitive plots of modern horror films. This overlooked gem is definitely worth a look. 8/10",Frailty
66,rbrb,Wow-what a good one!,10,10 October 2004,"There is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that I hit a gem with this one. From beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks.Father of two sons hears messages from ""God"" to kill people who he is told are 'demons'.When the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film; exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non-stop from beginning to end.And there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots, and the script is first class. All the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional. This film is at least as good as the likes of 'Silence of the Lambs'.",Frailty

68,ajs-10,Quite a compelling mystery thriller...,7,19 February 2011,"I watched this on the recommendation of a friend and was pleasantly surprised (thanks for that Mr The Aus Man). Although not perfect, I found it a quite compelling tale of how a vision from God can split a family apart and how it can lead to murder. I will tell you more of my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those who don't wish to know anything about the plot please dig a big hole in the back yard while I write the next paragraph).After a crop of murders perpetrated by the 'God's Hand Killer' remain unsolved, the lead FBI agent, Wesley Doyle, is surprised when a young man walks into his office and claims to know who the killer is. The man in question, Fenton Meiks, tells of how, at a young age he and his young brother, Adam, were roused in the middle of the night by their father. He has had a vision from God and they are to go out into the world and destroy demons put there by the devil. The boys live alone with their father after their mother died in childbirth. Fenton, being the older brother and is sceptical, but he also fears his father and so keeps quiet. The father is shown which tools to use in another vision and he brings these home. Soon the day comes when their father brings their first 'demon' home I will stop there as I don't want to give too much away.A lot of the story is told in flashback and I was impressed with the work of both Matt O'Leary as Young Fenton and Jeremy Sumpter as Young Adam. There were some nice touches in the cinematography and I was relieved that it didn't become a gore-fest, which it could so easily have done. Of the grown up actors, very powerful performances from both Bill Paxton as the father, and Powers Boothe as FBI Agent Wesley Doyle. Although more subdued, Matthew McConaughey put in a decent performance as Fenton Meiks.The film has a very slow and deliberate pace that slowly builds up the tension. I would have liked a little more background on the father, particularly about the strength of his faith before his visions. There is a bit of a double twist in the tale at the end which, at first I found a little disappointing, but then changed my mind when the second twist was revealed. Don't worry, no clues here! Over all, quite a compelling and powerful film that deals with the question of faith and how it can be misconstrued. I guess if you have very strong religious beliefs then you may not find this to your liking, but then, you never know. For me, I found it very watchable and quite compelling. Certainly worth watching for the performance of Matt O'Leary, he was excellent (IMO) Recommended.My score: 7.4/10",Frailty
69,Jack the Ripper1888,A pretty disturbing and scary serial killer movie.,10,25 April 2002,"This is no doubt one of the best movies that I have seen this year. Matthew McConaughey plays a man who goes into a sheriff's office one night and tells him that he knows who the identity of a serial killer that calls himself ""God's Hands"" is. He says it is his brother. *SPOILERS* We then get to hear his story told to the detective. It is the story of how his father woke them up one night, saying that God had spoken to him and had given him a mission. His mission was to destroy demons that disguise themselves as people. There isn't really much gore or CGI graphics. The closest thing that comes to CGI is a vision of a very cheaply made cardboard angel that comes out of the sky to greet Dad one night. Bill Paxton plays Dad in an emotionally disturbing role. This was a very frightening movie. It is scary because something like this might and probably has happened. This was a very good movie. I rate it the second best movie of the year so far next to PANIC ROOM. This really scared the hell out of me at some parts. It was intense and as I've said- disturbing! You will feel terrified after viewing this. This is a movie that will haunt audiences long after they have left the theater. The most gruesome parts were of Dad (who is only referred to as 'Dad' throughout) murders the demons right in front of his sons. Now, there is hardly any gore. But there is an extreme amount of violence. Axes will slam. The speakers will blast. And you will think to yourself ""HOLY S***!"". Some of the dialog was a little cheesy, but it was supposed to be that way to give an image of how their lives were like before this mission came up with them. The ending was predictable in some parts. There are about two or three different twists at the end. And while I really didn't understand them fully, they do make sense. If you sit down and really think about it, it will finally make sense to you. The first twist I was able to predict. The second one was a little more eerie. Now, you will not scream. You will be too petrified to scream. What you will do is sit tight, hold on to your popcorn and think to yourself ""God will forgive me"".......5/5.",Frailty

The story is slowly developing but never boring, there are no cheap shock-effects (like ""Oh my God, it's only the cat"") and the whole movie has got a great atmosphere. The rose garden is an extremely fine place for a dark story like this one. Bill Paxton did a good job directing this movie. And then there's the ending. Well, the good thing is, I didn't figure it out during the movie (at least not the exact ending) and the final climax is as thrilling as cinema can get. And the bad thing....
POSSIBLE SPOILER: ...the solution sucks! What the hell were they thinking? Is this supposed to be a statement pro death penalty?

75,moviesleuth2,Disturbing and unsettling,8,15 January 2008,"""Frailty"" is a hybrid of film-noir and horror. Given the dark natures of both genres, it seems that they should go hand in hand. However this is the first time I have seen them used together.This is not a movie for the faint of heart. It's both frightening on a psychological level and disturbing because it illustrates how a father brainwashed his own child into committing murders. This could easily have been a depraved slasher movie, but screenwriter Brent Hanley and director Bill Paxton (in astounding debuts-Hanley for screen writing and Paxton in his first time in the director's chair for a major motion picture) take time to develop the characters and the story so that the film touches a much deeper-and thus more disturbing level.The story is startlingly simple. A man (Bill Paxton) has a vision one night that he is told by God that he is ordered to kidnap and kill demons. His youngest son Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) supports him fully, but his older son, Fenton (Matt O'Leary) knows that what is happening is seriously wrong. The dad of course is not happy with this and thus proceeds to force Fenton to ""see God's will.""I'll start with the positives first. Kudos go first and foremost to Bill Paxton, for not only creating a fine motion picture on his first try, but one that excels at what it aspires to (for the most part). Also, he has the energy to create a believable character. We know that Paxton's character is crazy, but Paxton is so good that we actually believe that his character believes what he does is right. His two young costars are fine as well, especially since they are so young. Like Paxton, they fully convey what they believe they are doing is right. Looking back, the acting could seem a little melodramatic, but instead the atmosphere helps make it successful.""Frailty"" is a horror movie that has never been seen before and probably won't be seen for a long time (if ever again). It has the traditional forms of scares, but it is also scary on a deeper level. It isn't manipulative, and it knows that its subject matter is complex. Thankfully, it doesn't try to simplify this or simply use it as a setup. It fully addresses it head on, and that is what makes it succeed.",Frailty
76,movieguy1021,Frailty: 7/10,7,1 February 2003,"Frailty begins on a rainy night around 10 PM. A mysterious stranger (Matthew McConaughey) walks into a police department and talks to Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), saying he knows who the `God's Hand' killer is, a murderer who has been plaguing the land. To understand, however, you have to go back into the past.The stranger is Fenton Meiks. He's 12 or 13 and now played by Matthew O'Leary. He's in a motherless household in a small town in Texas. He lives with his nine year old brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) and father (Bill Paxton). His father doesn't get to spend much time with them, but it soon changes when an angel supposedly visits the father. The angel told him to `destroy demons' that haunt the land. Destroy, as in kill, and demons, as in demons who look exactly like humans. Adam, being young and susceptible to this, goes along, but Fenton has his reservations. Intensity ensues.Leave it to Bill Paxton to create a creepy yet subdued and spiritual movie with a theme that nobody could ever think of. Paxton, who also directs, played a disshelved father who loses it. From the creepy opening credits to the twist ending that I still haven't understood, I found myself enthralled and yet somewhat unsatisfied. Granted, with a shocker ending like this, it can't give you all the answers, but it ended too abruptly, yet it seemed to go over its 100 minute runtime. McConaughey did narration, since it is told in flashback, but it seemed to slim down more as we reached into the second act.To me, the greatest actor in this movie isn't McConaughey, Boothe, or even Paxton. O'Leary packed a powerhouse performance with credible emotions and a powerful display of grasping what is needed to be an actor. That's not to say that the others weren't good, in fact, they were quite good.The subject matter is quite disturbing and hauntful, so don't go in looking for a sobering experience, unless you are needing some spiritual guidance. I was shocked at times by the length they made this family go through. I won't spoil it.To lighten the mood, there should have been some more humor in it. Sure, the story and the entire movie is dark, but to put a couple one-liners or something in would have helped. It is always good to have some comic relief. The ending, as mentioned earlier, was unsatisfying. Most of the ending was predictable (such as the flashback about Doyle), leaving no surprise. The final twist, though, was just a shocker.One last point, I was surprised on how little blood there was; if some of the language was taken out it could have been a PG-13.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence and some language.",Frailty

79,statuskuo,Kudos To The Late Bill Paxton,9,30 December 2020,"After watching this, I now wonder what DIRECTOR Bill Paxton could've done with Stephen King's ""The Stand"" because this nails the dark humor to dread to fear mood down.
I am really saddened after reading the 1 star reviews, simply because it's this...this movie isn't a drama or psychological thriller or action or horror...it's ALL of that. And places it on the unreliable narrator, similar to ""The Usual Suspects"" but turns your expectations. Was it satisfying to those folks who need to be spoonfed genre? Looks like not. For me, it's this sad notion that the world and your childhood road could flip at something VERY odd. And as a kid, there is not much you can do about it.
But even THAT'S not what it's about. It's also about our interpretation of mental illness. Yes, it's a movie that needs to be diluted to a plot, but it is also a fascinating look at late 70's treatment of it through the eyes of kids. There was no internet research to prove a point. And are we to infer by this ending that the ends justified the means?
Again, for you to decide.

It's a well written and executed movie with an interesting theme. The movie keeps us in a dilemma regarding the complexities of the characters. The reason the movie is a unique watch is the story, which is disturbing, engaging and thrilling, also making us question who to vouch for. Overall it's a nice one
What did not work:
Of course the movie had some plotholes and flaws. One of them being the lightness the movie shows regarding the quest and their successes in their hunt , and also leaving some prints behind. Also, the movie comes to become more of a religious and spiritual mission rather than a psychological thriller.

82,Ali_John_Catterall,The family that slays together,7,3 November 2009,"In Bill Paxton's directorial debut, the family that slays together truly stays together. A dark little thriller concerning God-fearing rural Texan types with a yen for righteous serial killing Like Victor Kyam, Bill Paxton (the second-string Hollywood actor who starred in Twister, and played the hysterical marine in Aliens) liked the product so much, he 'bought the company'. Initially cast in the story's 'Dad' role, the actor was so impressed by the screenplay he decided to carry directing duties himself - with some startling, if decidedly mixed results. Much of Frailty is told in flashback, as Fenton Meiks (McConaughey) relates his troubled past to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Boothe), currently investigating a spate of Texas-based serial killings According to Meiks, he and his younger brother lived an idyllic life with their single-parent father (Paxton - known only as Dad), until their world was suddenly shattered by a series of Old Testament-style visions. It seems Dad's been singled out for greater things - charged with destroying demons who stalk the earth in human form. To the consternation of his elder son, and gee-whizz endorsement from the younger (fine performances here by juvenile leads Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter), a seemingly deranged Dad's soon ringing doorbells, axe in hand. So far, so nuts. There's much to admire here - the soundtrack, in particular (it's one of the most nerve-shredding since Dario Argento's house band, Goblin, turned their amps up to 11). And the tension is carefully crafted with light and shade, eschewing gore for psychological thrills. Unfortunately - and without giving too much away - one worries for Paxton and scriptwriter Brent Hanley's respective sanities, when faced with a denouement as clunky and stale as Frailty's. However, there's a spark of a good campfire yarn here (and if anything, it'll make you think twice about opening the door to your local Bible basher).",Frailty

I identified with one of the characters and that was it-the story just got under my skin. I don't understand why this film didn't become more popular. It is disturbing without being gory or subjecting the viewer to brutal, mind numbing gore. The film is very well made, the acting great and it has a great surprise twist at the end. However, if you are a person who likes mindless action and explosions in a film this probably won't be for you.",Frailty
84,Majikat76,A personal favourite!,8,29 April 2018,"I always felt this film was a bit of a hidden treasure! A unique take of what could be classed as serial killing.

That of toning down down blood and guts and sticking to the idea of just madness.The movie is somewhat scary, but is really not about murder or demons but about a family that is conflicted by someone who is a very loving father, but on the surface does HORRIBLE things..I enjoyed it, but a pattern did emerge and I will probably be the first to say that this was a little predictable for me..But it is all good ;)Rating 7 out of 10.Good cinematography too.",Frailty
86,fil-nik09,Great one,10,2 September 2016,"I just randomly picked up to watch this film and so glad I did. It is a great one! A psichological thriller with elements of horror and supernatural ( I dare say) in a very moody, dark, almost nausea feeling setting. From the moment the storyteller walks in to tell his story, you have a feeling that something is wrong - especially by the way he speaks ( very slowly ans as if in a dream).All actors were great! Adults and kids.Very interesting story and thought provoking. Maybe the beginning was a bit too slow but all in all, the pace of the film is great. The twists towards the end were really surprising! I must say the only thing that I did predict was the killing of the father. Somehow it was natural to be done and expected to be done. The end also left me a bit puzzled if the other brother was really killed and if he was really what the other one thought him ( and his father) to be. And if he was - what was his sin ? Maybe killing his father?For sure, one of the most interesting films I have seen in a while. Ten from me.",Frailty

Surprisingly, the strongest genre so far this year has been horror.  The three best films so far this year are as followed: Frailty, Blade 2, and The Mothman Prophecies. Frailty is the leader of this pack for a reason.While it might not be as frightening as many are saying, it is without question the most sinister film I have seen in recent memory.  The basic premise, of a father who tries to have his children accept his murders and encourages their cooperation, is stomach-turning.  The creepiest thing?  He does it all in the name of God.  The way the film handles this material is just plain eerie, and the final product is a film that I won't be forgetting anytime soon.  Make sure you don't know too much about Frailty before seeing it.Bill Paxton has a double triumph for directing this sick little film, and he also gives the strongest performance of the year as the disturbed father.",Frailty

Matthew McConaughey is great in the role of Adam Meiks, and Bill Paxton brilliantly played his father. The characters are interesting, Powers Boothe excellently portrayed FBI Agent Wesley Doyle.

92,Aly200,A Spooky Thriller,9,4 July 2016,"What would you do if you knew your father was a murderer who claims it's God's will? In Bill Paxton's directorial debut about two young boys living with their widowed father when suddenly their father begins to have visions that lead him to a violent crime spree, nothing is what it seems. Especially as the tale is recounted in flashbacks in the present day by one of the surviving sons to an FBI agent. The performances in this unsettling horror film are incredibly bold given the violent content of the story. The chemistry between Bill Paxton as the disturbed father who does love his children, but is lost in fanatic insanity and young actors Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter as the boys, Fenton and Adam Meiks, is beyond powerful. The dynamics of the differences between all three men is full of heartbreak as Fenton is troubled by his father's escalating insanity and Adam's blinding devotion to the murderous ""mission"" leading to tragic results. The film's other strong duo is the eerie portrayal of an adult Fenton by future A-lister Matthew McConaughey and in the portrayal of skeptic turned believer FBI agent Wesley Doyle is notable character actor Powers Boothe. The cat and mouse game of unraveling the film's present day mystery between Fenton and Agent Doyle provides the film's biggest twist.The film's narrative is shocking upon shocking moment from the terrifying tales of Dad Meiks's supposed visions to the horrific murders his boys are subjected to and then the ultimately tragic conclusion to the rampage, leading to the film's eye-popping twist in the present day story-line.",Frailty

95,BillBayard,A tale well told,8,24 October 2021,"I always thought that this was the very likeable Bill Paxton's only film that he directed, but I learned from here that there was another. I'll have to try and catch that as he showed great promise in this debut. I remember being very enthusiastic about this upon my first viewing 20 years ago, but didn't quite get that vibe this time around. It's an odd little film that I am not sure how to interpret and perhaps that is on purpose. It mostly all takes place one night primarily in an FBI office with a stranger telling a story, all shown in flashbacks, to an agent about his very disturbing and traumatic upbringing with his father and how it ties in with a serial killer over the years. I did not remember this well, but there is a twist that Amazon Prime gives away if you put it on pause, so beware. Is this the tale of a father gone mad who believes that God has ordered him to kill a list of strangers who are demons who passes this quest onto his son to continue upon his death? Or are these strangers actually demonic people that the father and son both have true visions of their evil deeds?! I'm really not sure. Based upon other reviews here, it all depends upon interpretation. Paxton plays the father and McConaughey, at his hottest, his son when grown up and telling this story while sitting in that FBI office that one night. It's well done and very intriguing.",Frailty
96,freaky_dave,Bill Paxton has a winner in his directorial debut,9,23 April 2006,"Bill Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for Frailty. He hits on all cylinders, but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the FBI agent (Powers Booth) which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller. Other than that, this movie was just fine.Bill Paxton plays Dad. He's never given a first name, but that is not a weakness of the film. It in fact strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind. He has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks(Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) must fine the demons and kill them. The demons look like normal people which they kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if Dad has just lost his mind, or is he really doing god's work. There are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense.The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and is speaking with FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and rightfully so. After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leads and Paxton work great together, looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder. Like I said there is the one implausibility involving Powers Booth's character, but it really isn't a big thing. This was an extremely well made film involving faith and family.",Frailty
97,Bento_de_Espinosa,Do not ever direct yourself!,1,31 January 2020,"It hurts, because I actually liked Bill Paxton. This film shows that (apart from being a bad director) he can be a bad actor too. In fact, most actors in this film were bad, especially the older boy. I just cannot believe Bill Paxton is a religious man, but this is what this film suggests, since, instead of showing the father as an insane Christian fundamentalist, it does the opposite. It turns out the dad was right: God, angels and demons do exist, God really commanded the dad to kill demons and it is good to lock a kid (his own son) in a cellar without water and food, in order to make him believe in God. Also, the film makes little sense because it does not show how the dad became such a fundamentalist. It does not show him once in a church, or reading the Bible or praying. Out of the blue, the dad starts to have visions and receive messages from God. Worse: the dad does not question these visions, his own sanity, like a normal person would do. He accepts the will of God straight away, as if killing demons (people) were the most natural thing in the world. And then that voice-over narration, telling everything we see happening. Terrible.Unfortunately, not good.",Frailty

However, the evil that he must destroy are actual citizens living among society. Is killing them God's work or murder? One child, hoping to connect more closely with his father decides then and there to follow his father all the way, the other decides to do the opposite and resist what he sees as insanity. What I liked about this film was the unique twists that it took. You think that you have this movie figured out and you think that you know what is coming up, but you don't. You think you know who is evil and who is good, but you don't. You think that certain images are disturbing and wrong, but they might not be. Moreover, the movie tackles the issue of faith better than any I have seen in a long time. After all, what is faith? Is it believing something that appears to be improbable or is it doing what is perceived to be the right thing? Sometimes the truth is right there in front of our noses, but we don't see it.",Frailty
100,LanceBrave,"Sweet, sweet ambiguity",8,3 November 2013,"When an actor turns to director, you never know what to expect. Usually, an actor's first crack at directing is an ugly little vanity project. Occasionally, a real classic is born when an actor steps behind the camera. ""Frailty"" is not exactly a ""Night of the Hunter"" or ""Unforgiven,"" but it is an ambitious, surprising directorial debut from veteran character actor and sometimes leading man Bill Paxton.Told in flashback against the backdrop of a Texas serial killer investigation, ""Frailty"" is mostly set in the late 1970s. Fenton and Adam live with their single father, a simple man, a car mechanic. Their normal lives are interrupted one night when Dad wakes them in their beds, claiming to have received a vision from God. That he and his sons are chosen as warriors against demons that walk among man. Fenton is terrified, hoping the whole situation is a nightmare, while Adam is faithful to his father. Both boys will have their faiths tested as their father's actions become more and more extreme.""Frailty"" goes out of its way not to present Paxton's father character as a religious fanatic. He has a warm, close relationship with both boys. The lack of a mother is not focused on, aside from a picture on a bedside nightstand. The early scenes, of the two brothers talking in bed or the family gathered around the dinner table, establish a relaxed, familial tone. You quickly understand that these three only have each other. Dad's vision breaks this safe bubble apart. A parent turned insane or deadly is a primal fear. Two particular moments in ""Frailty"" plays this up to chilling effect. The next morning, after Dad tells the sons of his vision, Fenton hopes it was only a dream. At first, this might seem the case, as their morning routine progresses normally Until, as they walk to school, Dad reminds both boys not to mention any of it to anyone. Later on, Fenton tells the local sheriff about the crimes, the unbelieving cop following the boy back to the house. When Paxton turns to his son and asks him if any further investigation is necessary, the film reaches a peak of malevolent atmosphere.Paxton is a surprisingly self-assured first time filmmaker. He is open about the influence Hitchcock and ""Night of the Hunter"" had on him, visually quoting from both. His direction is stylish but rarely distracting. The camera moves smoothly, following characters along when needed. When Paxton's camera becomes more direct, it's for a reason. Fenton's run through town, visualized by shooting the actor on a treadmill, or his fall into inner darkness, showed by placing the actor on a black mat, deepen the story's emotion. There are other clever moments, Fenton slipping into shadow or his face crossed over a stone guard dog. Only a Vertigo Shot late in the film is too on-the-nose. Paxton doesn't back away from invoking classic horror atmosphere with fog or moonlight breaking through trees. ""Frailty"" looks spectacular.The film quickly sets its central question up as one of faith. Is Dad insane, like Fenton fears? Is God truly involved in the proceedings? Are the victims innocent bystanders or truly demons in human form? At least at first anyway, ""Frailty"" leaves things fantastically ambiguous. We have Fenton's sympathy. He doesn't know if demons are real but he knows that murder is wrong. However, Paxton is so convincing and so likable as Dad that you can't help but wonder. The existence of God, demons, the apocalypse, fate, and morality: These are big questions for a scrappy little thriller to address. It handles them all in a mature fashion, always allowing the audience to decide.At least until the end anyway. In its final minutes, ""Frailty"" throws away all that sweet, sweet ambiguity. Any time there's a twist ending, the screenwriter should always ask themselves if the twist reflects on the film's themes or enriches its story. On one level, ""Frailty"" succeeds in that regard. The twist changes the way the viewer watches the rest of the movie. However, it's just plot mechanics. By declaring definitively what happened, what this meant, the ending weakens the overall film. It's nothing longer a meditation on faith but instead simply a twisting, turning thriller. Fine, sure, but not as exciting.Still, for most of its run time, ""Frailty"" is an exciting, complex horror-thriller. Paxton and Matt O'Leary are excellent in the lead roles. Jeremy Stumper is a bit flat, playing too much like an insecure child actor. Matthew McConaughey's voice over is mostly unneeded but the actor nicely plays against his folksy image. Brain Tyler's score is elegant and quietly ominous. It's a shame about that reveal because otherwise ""Frailty"" would have been a true sleeper classic. It's still a great sleeper but could have been a better one.",Frailty
101,deadbull-95171,"A rarity, An intelligent well acted horror drama",8,2 January 2021,"A good script and fine actors doing fine acting wins again. It has its share of bloody murder but that is subordinated to the compelling storyline of what produces that results.
It is just as strong for what it does NOT have, the anti-qualities that predominate in 99% of movies of this general genre. It does not have 5 teenagers taking a little pleasure trip to a deserted cabin the woods to be chased by some ludicrous demented serial killer or mysterious spirit. It does not have another common variant, where a bunch of punks decide to prove a house isn't haunted only to be picked off one by one by some sort of ghost, nor is it a fake blood splattered brainless mess.
it's very simple and very rarely occurred. The principal actors are seasoned pros that take there jobs seriously and create believable plausible people dealing with a highly implausible situation, one that in fact is all too true. It does have a twist ending, but nothing so overblown as The Usual Suspects or seven etc. It just makes sense and bring s tghe script to a balanced sensible end.
Look, this is all subjective. It is simply MY preference to see a few fine actors interacting within the context of a well composed and original script. So, it combines elements of good drama, which is always human, within what is probably a dominant horror genre.
No obvious cheap shock scare s that come to mind. You just get more deeply drawn into a great campfire story for adults.
I don't give it a ten because i suppose I have standards that reserve that for things like Let the right one in...The Swedish movie, not the disastrous American Hollywood version rip off. In general the foreign movies are ALWAYS more sophisticated because they are more intelligent in every way. Of course there are exceptions. I love Lumet directed stuff, or Scorsese, and Oliver stone has sure scored....and I don't consider Polanski American but he did a lot of great work here...and I am just picking obvious well known people to illustrate.
I can see where someone would give this a ten though and I would not argue it strongly, I'd argue if someone gave it a 6 or lower .

103,pontram,Extremely dangerous,1,16 June 2010,"Its a movie. Only a movie. But a movie of some class - and this have it without a doubt - has something behind. A message. An overtone. A direction. Some meaning. ""Frailty"" has, and I consider it to be a dangerous one.1st of all, the movie gives for more than three quarters the impression that it's all about a misled, maybe psychotic father who utilizes his position of power to mislead his two children to serve his own irrational and monstrous belief. After we see him as a quite normal and caring dad, he introduces them to a holy vision he had and later they see what's about the great plan of god with him - killing people who are demons.It seems to have been in order to let us share in the sad and painful life of two children which had the bad luck to grow up in a Christian fanatics' family, with a most heavily psychotic father, and some of us may agree that from what the rest of the world hears and sees about life in America, it is not uncommon there to grow up like this.Even to show us a metaphor of how easy naive minds, especially children, can be brainwashed by others who are socially powerful, or talented enough to persuade them of the most perverted and irrational ideas imaginable (and what other label could be given to those demon fantasies from the darkest middle age and earlier, than irrational), the movie works very seriously for nearly one and a half hour, even if there are some mild supernatural reminiscences, which could declare everything as pure fantasy (which it is), but actually do not.Then, in the last chapter - I hope so much for the creators that they only intended box office quotes and not Christian sympathy points - the real dangerous part, the mystery-for-real-part begins. It is revealed, that every psychotic and perverted belief of the father, every cruel act he did to his son and his victims, was righteous and good. Yes, the movie also sanctions the unacceptable deeds of the psychopath and his traumatically indoctrinated offspring as THE WILL OF GOD. The young son's decision to kill his father, we think he did it to stop the serial killing, it exposes to be an act of a demon to save his demonic friends. He will grow up to a serial killer demon who seeks attention of his holy brother to be rightfully distroyed.Good twist, but what an awful attitude is behind. The world is full of demons which deserve to be destroyed (since when is the demon destroyed when the body is killed, I ask all exorcists), because of a single man's visions. And the more realistic (!) twist, where the movie would have the chance to change its direction, in particular that it turns out dad's visions were a hoax from the devil, and dad is one of the demons, and the crimes of his victims false visions, sent by the evil, this twist is missing, and I fear I know why - the Highest granted license to kill, no joke intended.It would seem that I'm taking this too seriously. But this movie looks like a social drama for just too long, too serious, too well made. I must take it seriously at a certain point. Especially when it turns out to be a PROPAGANDA FILM for something a modern civilized human, regardless of his/her religion, should stand against. Literally demonizing other people is not only a sign of mental illness, it is de facto a part of how politics are made since ever to get inconveniently people out of the way (for ever). And I think we must stand against this not only by ignoring it, but pointing at it and saying WRONG.You could say, this is only a small budget horror/mystery flick, and it was no block buster, take it easy. Only to the second, I can agree, with a little ease. But when I see that number of reviews (~440) and ratings (~27000) here, my ease is already flown away.Would it not be so problematic, I would have given 7 or even 8 stars for decent acting and directing, instead of 1.",Frailty

Like Bush, the Paxton character really believes god is directing him. He enlists his two sons to help in the ""demon-killing"" even though one of them, Fenton, is very much opposed to it. This is a very enthralling movie but the ending spoiled it for me. I won't tell you how it ends since i don't even understand it myself, but let's just say it was confusing. Pay attention during the last 15 minutes or else.The acting by Paxton and the two kids is first rate.

Wisely building up atmosphere, and tension instead of going down the gore route, he turns in an impressive directorial debut.The only downside was the twist at the end.  It could have shot the film in the end, but Paxton manages to keep things tight.It's good to see that working with both James Cameron and Sam Raimi, Paxton has picked up some tips on how to handle material such as this.  On this basis, it seems that if he decides to stop acting and direct full-time, he has a promising career ahead of him.",Frailty

109,tequila101,Let's Go Get Some Demon!,9,10 January 2012,"""Frailty"" is a excellent example of a modern horror/thriller film. This film twists and plays with your mind to an extent where you end up in a roll of confusion, energy, fun and depression. I think this film is also one of the best in the modern genre of horror and it will be a classic one day. I'm saying this because it's surprisingly a film I would put in the category ""They just don't make films like this anymore"". And it's true, many of the horror films we've been getting lately are remakes, sequels or prequels which are ever exciting or pointless. ""Frailty"" is an original idea which offers so much.The story sets on the Meiks family with twos sons called Adam and Fenton with their Daddy who live a normal life in a normal world and they enjoy it together. One night, on any other normal night, Dad Meiks wakes up the two boys and tells them he has had a vision from God and that there are demons amongst them and that they must serve the will in killing them. Adam seems to get pulled into it while as Fenton wants to escape the horror and live a normal life. Fenton all grown up confesses his tragic life story to an FBI agent who is on the look out for the ""God's Hand Killer"".The script and direction this film was taken into was superbly and surprisingly done well. Bill Paxton who not only directs this film but also stars in it as the dad does a chilling job at his role as well as his excellent story telling. What he captures so well with the character of the dad is if he's really seeing angels and demons or if he's going plain crazy? I'm still not sure what it could be but I think it might be both. The two little boys also did a job at building up their persona's of their characters and the back up actors did good in what they had to do. But the most outstanding performance was Matthew McConaughey who played the adult 'Fenton'.I also like the overall tone. Very sad, gloomy, creepy, scary at times and dark. Every death scene was also done really well and it left us to the imagination of how the bodies were devoured and mutilated. It's smart when it comes to violence because it doesn't have to show any detail to creep out audiences.Overall, ""Frailty"" is definitely worth the see and maybe even the buy if you can get it cheap. It's one of the better modern horrors around.9/10",Frailty

But instead we get stupid & predictable crap like SCORPION KING, ICE AGE, THE ROOKIE, etc. that are taking over the box office, when its great films like FRAILTY that should be on top. If you are into psychological thrillers, then this is a movie for you.

111,jrfranklin01,Bill Paxton Directed This?!,6,11 December 2004,"Wow! That's a shocker - Bill Paxton directed ""Fraility"". I discovered this after I watched the film, so it's a bit more stunning now. That and the fact that the last thing I saw Bill in was Broken Lizard's ""Club Dread"", which was...well, read my review.2001 appears to have been a popular year for directors to get into a ""Sixth Sense"" surprise approach to things (this film and Identity come to mind). Fraility shows Bill Paxton as a single father with two boys. They live out in a rural area and are simple folk. The film gets strange when Bill (Mr. Meiks) receives some message from an angel that tells him to go out and hunt demons. He gets his kids involved in a killing spree justified by divine instruction. One of his kids, Fenton, resists and thinks his dad's gone crazy. The other, Adam, totally believes his father. A strange right-of-passage begins when the father tries to get his oldest son, Fenton, to kill one of the ""demons"". The people described as demons are ordinary-looking people with regular jobs, families, etc. They are tied up and begging for their lives through tear-covered faces and mouth gags.The father tells Fenton that an angel told him Fenton was a demon and should be destroyed. Instead, the dad tries to ""convert"" Fenton through hard work and prayer. That boy sure can did himself a heck of a hole! Fenton tries to squeal to the cops as his father's demon-killing continues. Years later, an older Adam is shown in Matthew McConaughey, who actually recounts the tale of his childhood (opening part of film). Adam has taken his father's place as a religious murderer known as the ""God's Hand"" killer.His brother is on his list of demons to destroy.When I mentioned earlier ""The Sixth Sense"" I was trying to refer to this film's ambition in giving you a shocking/surprising ending. I will say that it does this rather well. But the idea behind the film (while unique) is strangely morbid. That and the religious theme involved also makes it a bit...unsettling. Perhaps this is exactly what the director (Bill Paxton) was hoping to achieve. 6/10",Frailty
112,monkey-man,great movie,8,24 July 2005,"I thought this movie would be OK but the movie turned out to be really great the movies about how a man goes to an F.B.I headquarters to tell them about some murders he knows of and then the man tells the F.B.I agent were the bodies are so he drives down to where they are and on the way the man tells him of his story.This movie stars actors like Bill Paxton,Matthew McConaughey,Matt O'Leary,Jeremy Sumpter and Powers Boothe.Bill Paxdon does a great job at acting in this movie and so does Matthew McCnaughey and this is the best movie i have seen Bill Paxdon in in a long time.Over all this movie was great with never a boring scene and my rating is 8 out of 10.",Frailty

A great play on the serial killer theme, and hearing voices from God, which many real life killers claim to have experienced. With solid direction from the late Bill Paxton and great acting throughout. And for a more mainstream horror movie, it still packed some serious punches.Salut, Bill Paxton.",Frailty
114,maximovlE,Almost great!,1,3 February 2019,"Seemed like a great movie. The best monster movies are the ones where you don't see the monster, it creates the fear of the unknown which is always scarier than any amount of cgi. The best thrillers work in the same way, you don't know who is guilty until the twist, and the better the twist the better the movie.This movie had all of that. Nothing was given away. Surely they couldn't really see demons, that would be ridiculous. Surely nothing was happening at all when the father was touching the victims. Except insanity. That's how I saw it anyway. The way it was presented it was up to you the viewer to decide for yourself, come up with your own conclusions. And look forward to an exciting unknown ending.The twist came along and worked. It was the other brother talking to the agent all along. Great, ok, so how's it going to end?Demons really do exist. The dad was right all along... Really???An above average thriller... no I'll be fair, a good and unique thriller.... Disappears before your eyes and becomes a fantasy flick about demon hunters.Someone please tell me there's another version out there with an alternate ending. You know, a good one!",Frailty
115,skymovies,Nice slice of Southern gothic,8,4 July 2003,"An effectively eerie little thriller based on the fact that lots of killers excuse their actions by saying that either (a) God, or (b) Daddy made them do it. It then goes one step further to ask which bond is stronger: father-son or father-son-and Holy Ghost?Though it's not without flaws, Paxton shows admirable restraint from the director's chair where an established director might have tried some ill-advised showboating.Lord knows how many people are out there like this. Makes you wonder.",Frailty
116,ZeroCoolRO,This movie really is a masterpiece. WOW,10,1 September 2021,"I'm still shocked about how good this movie was. The movie started so nice, showing us the family, the father and 2 sons, all was good until that night when the father saw the angel who told him about the demons that are on earth and that he need to kill them.At first I thought that the father went crazy or developed some mental illness or something and had hallucinations but still he affected the little kid a lot because he believed everything the father said... and thats how serial killers are born :) but watching it until the end was really worth it cuz wasn't really anything like that.The demons actually were pretty bad people, the first woman was some murderer, the old man was a pedophile, and the rest probably were as bad as others. So they didn't murdered demons per se, they killed really bad people. Somehow in the end really put some question inside of you head, was there really and angel who game the father those names? We saw the angel on that scene where the dad was at work under the car. But why an angel give him the name of really bad people, to kill. Isn't God like against murder?What I don't understand was why Fenton was a demon, he didnt do anything wrong, he was a kid ... the only bad thing he did was killing his father on that night, but the father knew that Fenton was a demon before that.The visions were real, somehow Adam like his father could see the bad things others did when he touched them, that FBI dude confirmed that when Adam touched him and we saw the vision of him killing his mother, the FBI agent said ""how did you know"".Then another interesting fact was that the next day those that met him couldn't remember his face, and on the video tapes was static over him so no one could identify him.",Frailty
117,Panterken,Fairly original horror movie that doesn't reach it's full potential.,5,7 December 2007,"This is one of the first times I've seen a movie overrated on IMDb. I'm an optimistic person and usually think most movies are underrated but 'Frailty' really isn't an excellent psychological study. I'm not much of a writer and I think I could come up with a story much more original than that and dialog far better. I'm not saying it's a bad movie but it's very flawed. Too flawed to be rated that high.First of all, these kinds of movies, where you have 2 possible sides of a story, should always leave something open for the audience's interpretation. The ending really ruined it for me. Explaining everything in the end in 2 minutes felt so cheap and I think it's a sign of a lack of respect towards the audience.Second of all, I thought the acting wasn't any good. Quite simple, none of the actors delivered a good performance. They were okay, but I felt their performance should've been better. Maybe the movie would've had more of an impact on me then. Now, I just felt bored most of the time. The cast really couldn't drag me into the story.Now, don't trash my comment because I have some critical comments. I have a right to an opinion too and I'm not a hater in any way. Now, here are the positive points.For a horror movie, Frailty was fairly original. There was no unnecessary excessive gore present and horror clichés were avoided. Paxton did a fairly good job directing though I feel some more music would've been a good idea. I really liked the concept of 'the rose garden'. Every time this word was mentioned, shivers went down my spine. They painted that image well and I think it's one of the better horror elements created in recent years. The young actor who played Fenton did a good job, being a kid and all, and he compensated Paxton's inability to act. I didn't like the plot twist that McConaughy was actually Adam instead of Fenton, but at least there were some plot twist towards the end. Some movies just die out after an hour and Fraily actually got more and more interesting towards the end.I'd recommend this since it's entertaining but at the same time I feel the movie is a letdown. The premise is great and I feel they didn't make the most of it.A similar, and better story, can be read in S.King's Lisey's story. Now there's a compelling psychological piece of literature.5.5/10",Frailty

I thought that the story was fantastic, the direction was smooth and pretty seemless when shifting from past to present.  The absence of large amounts of blood and gore from this movie reminds me of the way some of the old masters used to film their horror scenes, and I think that in this film it was all the more effective.

It is funny because even after watching so many movies, True Detective (2014– ) was the first time I saw him (not to mention brief moment in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) ). I loved his role so much, the way he showed it etc. After I have finished the series I wanted to watch every movie with him.I love dark, gloomy,creepy, depressive movies and I have high expectation from this one! Let's start watching it!30 minutes and I am thinking that the rating might be highly affected by the majority of butt-hurted Christian retards... who have found this movie offensive for their pure b*llsh*t religion...Anyways so far so good, I love the dark mood, seriousness and the way by which the story is told... it's disturbing and I love it! 1h- damn... the movie is really twisted... the most dreadful thing is that it's very probable... something that might happen or already has... It gives it a raw taste of how fu*k*d up the reality can be...Oh boy it is a great movie :) I just have finished watching it and I liked it very much! Now I have to give it an 8/10 on IMDb just to boost it a little bit... but my real rating for this movie is right below.

121,mweston,3 stars,7,11 May 2002,"Using a structure similar to The Usual Suspects, the story is told by a man who introduces himself as Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe). He says that his brother, Adam, is the ""God's Hands"" serial murderer that Doyle is in charge of finding. The bulk of the film is Meiks' story.The story begins when Fenton and Adam are young boys, living with their father (played by Bill Paxton, who also directed). It shows how Fenton takes care of his younger brother, since their mother died giving birth to him. Fenton cooks dinner, does the dishes, and so on. It's a simple life, but it works for him.Then one night the father has a vision of an angel, who tells him that the end of the world is near, and that he and his sons are needed to destroy demons who live as and appear to be normal people. Fenton hopes that this was a bad dream, but soon finds that his world, which the film just showed as being simple and comfortable, has been turned upside down. And worse, unlike his younger brother, he doesn't believe that his father has really heard from an angel. He believes that his father has simply gone crazy. The only thing keeping Fenton from running away is his fear for Adam's life, and Adam refuses to listen.Thrillers are not a genre that I generally seek out. This one seems to be a good example, with the added dimensions of the effect on the two boys and of questioning faith. Thankfully, the serious violence is generally kept off screen, although watching the reactions of the boys witnessing their father committing murder/destroying demons is still hard to watch.The story doesn't go where I expected it to. At least one review I read found the ending to be a problem, but I found that the twists made the film more interesting to me, almost reaching another half a star in my rating. The performances are good, but not exemplary, although the young actor who played Fenton as a boy stood out. This is Paxton's first film as director, and his work here is good. In fact I would say that this film is better than most of the films he has appeared in as an actor. I would definitely recommend this film to you if this description sounds good. For people like me who don't normally go to thiller/horror films, this might or might not be worth breaking your normal patterns to see.Seen on 5/7/2002.",Frailty
122,fredberglyle,"FRAILTY, Frail ending & moral",6,24 May 2014,The movie started strong. The screenplay is superb in the way it is very easily understandable and thrilling. The child actors are very good and it is so rare to see children so perfect in acting. I didn't have big hopes for this film (as it was taken in a limited budget) but to my surprise the movie was far better from my expectation and the credit must go to Bill Paxton. Things I hated in the movie is the message/moral and the twists that was not of my liking.The bottom line : A good serial killer movie for chills except for the ending. PG is advised for violence/killing scenes and few profane words.,Frailty
123,KingM21,Slay some demons!,8,2 September 2005,"This one is a real sleeper of modern horror. It doesn't get mentioned often but it's a far more enthralling and thought-provoking watch than most of the stuff that makes it to the big screen. The plot revolves around demon slaying, though this is no CGI action-fest like Constantine but more of a haunting, mysterious exploration of the subject. The way I took the story is that Dad and Adam were, in fact, destroying demons, as opposed to murdering people. However, there are several other hints that point to the latter, which really leaves the door open for interpretation. Watch it and decide for yourself! You'll be glad you did.",Frailty
124,fubared1,"Interesting film, BUT...",5,19 February 2003,"Generally well-directed, but one can attribute this to the veteran cinematographer and editor.  Paxton makes 3 mistakes, and they are LULUS. First, he cast himself in the lead, and he gives the weakest performance in the film, even compared to the children (and I generally hate child actors), 2nd, he cast the other most unlikeable actor in the business (next to himself) in the secondary character, and 3rd (and worst of all), one of the victims deserves to die simply because she is a lesbian (compared to a pederast and a wife-beater).  Only an idiot could have committed such a huge (and politcally incorrect in the worst sense of the words) mistake.  One could blame it on the writer, but as director Paxton could have changed it. Too bad as this film showed promise.",Frailty
125,brandon_lee420,Two words to describe this film: Pure Fun!,9,4 February 2010,"What a fantastic movie! Bill Paxton and Mathew McConaughey are absolutely terrific in this film! A must-see!. Bill Paxton, one of the greatest actors and director of all time (just for Frailty), has made a movie which is still terrifying people, especially me to this day. He should have won an Oscar for his wonderful acting and directing. This is his best role in a film ever! Matthew McConaughey has a liking to work in crappie movies, see Fools Gold and Sahara, but in Frailty he works to the best of his abilities resulting in perfection. Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter did really well for teenage actors and their performances were engaging and promising. The film doesn't have any boring bits that bore you to death or are slow but instead they are fast-paced and well-packed. The twist at the end will leave some viewers shocked while others will have a hint of the end. Sadly, I was one of those people and that is why it lost a star from me. There are somethings which make the film more mysterious and engaging, like the beheading scenes but they don't actually show it. That is how smart Bill Paxton is. The end is confusing and you will be thinking if it is real or not. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life and it will remain in that list forever.Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey), comes forth to tell the FBI that his brother Adam may be the serial killer who calls himself God's Hands, who the FBI has been searching for. The film uses flashbacks to show Meeks' childhood with a father (Bill Paxton) who believed he was on a mission from God to destroy demons that inhabit human bodies. Fenton saw his dad as evil, while Adam saw him as a hero.Nearly everyone will love or like this film but the 2 percent retards don't know a thing about fun or movies and they probably like criticizing everything they see or will ever see. The narration by Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) added more taste to the film and I always love films with narration, simply because the voice of the narrator and his story telling is so, so.......compelling. Everyone should at least watch it once and should definitely prepare for a roller-coaster ride about religion, and right an wrong. 9/10 - Incredible!",Frailty
126,MattBirk,One of the Best Hidden Gems Out There!,9,25 March 2015,"A true hidden gem in the horror genre, Frailty is a slow burn movie with a strong premise and fantastic acting. It takes a pretty common motive (God made me do it) and shows the darker side of being God's right hand man. The perspective of the movie makes it look like the person who is committing murder, 'in the name of God', look like a total lunatic who is off the walls insane. And at the same time this possible 'hero' is willing to sacrifice his relationship with his son for the man upstairs. Is it worth it? That's just one of the many questions Frailty poses through its dark and tormented story. Frailty has an overall bittersweet feeling, on one hand the father is supposedly ridding the world of demons, but at the cost of losing his son. But what makes the movie so effective is that it is told from the perspective of the son who doubts his father and has no one to turn to for help....not even God. There is something harrowing about having Frailty being told through the eyes of a helpless child, it's basically brilliant. In doing so it takes away the fall back that most movies fail to mention, adults, they become 'useless' in a sense because they fail to understand or see what truly is happening to the child. This is something that feels painfully real, how many adults would honestly listen to a child that age, saying the things he says and actually believe him over his father? The situation is all too real and all too perfect. In the end, Frailty really gets you thinking about right and wrong and when if ever, you should take the life of another human being.",Frailty

It's a good directorial debut for Bill Paxton, who also stars as ""Dad"". The story of him raising his two kids with his seemingly twisted beliefs is not for the faint of heart, but an interesting premise for the overall story which plays out with Matthew McConaughey (one of his grownup sons) and Powers Boothe as the FBI agent. It's well acted by both the adult and child actors. You can't help but feel compassion for the kids, but your feelings for ""Dad"" might vary as the movie progresses.

There is nothing offensive about any group for any intelligent viewer.  It is true there are some younger actors related to violence but certainly but that is not new considering Children of the Damned, Bad Seed, or Good Son.  If a very mature teenager views this film it is certainly less harmful than Jeepers Creepers or mind bending films like American Pie or Sweetest Thing.  In fact young people are seldom exposed to classics like Rear Window, Psycho, or Wait until Dark but watch slasher films like the fair but mindless Scream.  Frailty is worthy of Hitchcock or Brian de Palma.  Paxton is great as both director and actor. Matthew is a new Sean Penn and has that intensity of a young Brando or Anthony Perkins.

134,Manal1987,Not just a thriller!,7,1 April 2011,"A mind-boggling experience! Frailty is one of these movies that leave you at the end without knowing what to think or how to feel. It took me a while to take it all in. At the beginning, I thought it was just a movie about the moral and religious dilemma of good and evil... what is good? What is evil? How and who to judge and tell them apart? A quite important but worn-out theme... The problem is that the events started to take a totally unexpected turn that upset my mind's apple cart. Due to the blurring of narrative perspectives (you don't know exactly from which/whose side the story is told), you lose grip of the certainty you had and get lost in a sea of doubts: what-ifs, is-it-trues, and it-could-bes.

The cast is outstanding - Powers Boothe and Matthew McConaughey interact in a coordinated and perfidious manner (they are both Texas boys - so no wonder). I needn't say how good Bill Paxton is in here, as he aced almost any part in any movie he did so far. Now, Jeremy Sumpter and especially Matt O'Leary, they make this movie remarkably good. It's Matt's performance that adds tremendous authenticity and emotional depth to the plot. He plays in a way that demands considerable talent and skills - and both he has. Here he shows how mature he is and in which experienced manner he is able to handle such difficult roles such as the one of Fenton. I like him very much, he is incredibly strong in both his performance and his psychological endurance. Bravo! Jeremy Sumpter as Matt's junior partner here aces his part as well.

The acting is good, even great in some cases (Fenton, dad), the story starts out very intriguing, and ends with a superb twist. But, unless I'm missing something huge, it has an extremely disturbing message, namely that religious fanatic murders are justified.

138,JRmf,What's Bill Paxton trying to do...??,3,15 November 2006,"Get everyone to convert to Islam? So this is the way Christians should deal with ""demons"" (in human form) - kidnap and bind them, before summarily axing them to death and burying them in the Rose Garden? Oh yes, it helps if you're a young widower with two prepubescent boys, to induct them young into the ways of the faith.I was disappointed with this movie which had an IMDb rating of 7+ (I gave it a 3). Some have compared it to Silence Of the Lambs but on no account does it deserve that status. Why? Too obviously contrived - the head investigator into the God's Hand murders also turns out to be a demon who just happens to be guilty of slaughtering his mother. This discovery/twist is apparently what the movie is meant to be all about.And too many plot holes: When elder son Fenton went to the Sheriff after the 3rd murder, the latter showed no recognition of the previous 2 murders and denounced the boy as a rebellious teen. When Dad locked Fenton in the dungeon for god-knows how many weeks, there was no inquiry from the school? How did the handcuffed Fenton (or was it other son Adam) so easily overpower the gun-toting and wary investigator?About the only thing which impressed about this film was the angst of a 13 something son watching his father descend into madness and murder, and having to choose between joining in that madness (hacking someone to death for the first time on his father's orders, or be otherwise denounced as a ""demon"" oneself) or turning on the father.

140,DVR_Brale,Extremely gloomy milieu with religious main premise brilliantly utilized by the twist,7,23 August 2016,"How would you respond to a person claiming that an angel had revealed to them a secret mission to fight forces of evil? Can you imagine a child confronting such an adult? What if that adult is child's father? These scary questions are exactly what furnishes Frailty's context.Frailty can be described as a noir mystery thriller. The atmosphere itself is extremely gloomy, never pointing to a happy ending. It can be compared to darkness and bleakness in The Machinist. The whole milieu made me feel very uncomfortable, more than most of the horror movies could. If you want to experience similar tension see It Follows (2014).So, one day a man (McConaughey) walks into detective's office apparently knowing who the God's Hand killer is. It's very dark, it's raining and there's nobody there except this exhausted man and steady, calm detective. This man starts to tell detective a story about his father (Bill Paxton) who was once approached by an angel and given a secret mission. From that point on nothing was the same again.As he continues to tell his story we delve more and more into a dark world which is created by psychological states and religious convictions each member of the family has. Tension is thus brilliantly furnished by focusing on family relationship which is by definition somewhat separated from the rest of the world existing as a private entity. All three members of the family are on different levels be it maturity, physical strength, religious convictions or intellect. Now add to it a seemingly supernatural element which influences different members differently and plays with their psyche and you have a formidable movie without using explicit techniques horror movies usually use.Everything that happens points out and prepares us for the twist. Since Frailty's main premise is religious, the twist establishes a framework for a debate on the topic of religious fanaticism; what makes a religious fanatic? Why does one become religious fanatic? Only due to family influences or due to psychological delusion? But what if Christian doctrine of angelology and demonology is true? What if angels and demons do exist and can communicate with us and even take human form? Would that possibility somehow justify at least some actions?Mentioning anything more would rip you off from the experience. Wait for a rainy night and watch it by yourself.

141,Mikelikesnotlikes,Strange twists at the end - too confusing,6,20 March 2017,"The film starts off on an eerie note of the father's sudden madness/delusion being shared with impressionable children. We have almost no background at all to tell where this madness comes from. And we aren't given a single character viewpoint to help us decide. We are always on the outside, allowed to make up our own mind whether the things the characters are feeling are true or delusional. We are following along behind powerful, psychologically probable, series of events.And then comes the weird twists near the end. It's almost as if the Director/or someone with power over the film, changed their mind about certain plot mechanics. Maybe they wanted a more commercially acceptable ending, maybe they wanted to wrap up the story more neatly. It looks like a 11th hour decision was made to cut this movie in a way it wasn't originally intended.I think the plot could have worked without SHOWING Adam as ACTUALLY being the Hand of God. Leaving the audience wondering would have been far more powerful. Confusion and dissatisfaction is what I felt throughout the last 15 minutes of so.",Frailty

And then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case. During that trip, the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission.This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned. It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers.",Frailty
143,evilmatt-3,What is wrong with these people in Hollywood?,4,14 April 2002,"Over the past few years, we have been seeing a number of movies coming out of Hollywood that have great premises, but absolutely moronic writing.  I thought that A.I. was where we hit the bottom of the barrel.  I was wrong.OK, so the dad's a religiously fanatic serial killer.  Fine.  Let's look at the effect it has on the children.  Good place to start.  And like so many other recent films, everything's good until the last twenty minutes. However, what many call a ""surprise ending"" I call complete garbage, as well as utter nonsense.  If you've seen the movie (and I pity you if you have), I invite you to write me and tell me whether the ending to this film is good or bad.  I honestly can't say.  I suppose that depends on what you think of Christianity.  Frankly, if I was Christian, I would be offended either way because the ending is just that ridiculous.EARTH TO HOLLYWOOD: Enough with the ""surprise endings"" already.  You're killing us.  Really.And incidentally, Bill Paxton, if this is the only kind of movie you're interested in directing, don't quit your day job.",Frailty
144,el_monty_BCN,I was hoping the twist wouldn't come...,6,18 July 2004,"SPOILERS!OK, so I'm watching this movie, and it's pretty obvious that McConaughey is gonna turn out to be the killer. We've all seen The Usual Suspects and we know that when a movie is set as a flashback account from a ""witness"" spilling the beans to the cop, he's probably just laying the blame on others for his own deeds. So I could take McConaughey being Adam, who had been turned crazy by his crazy father, and planning to kill agent Doyle from the start; in fact I was counting on it. Fine by me.What I could NOT take was Dad and Adam ACTUALLY doing God's work. That ruined it for me, because it's ludicrous. It's just a twist for the sake of a twist. The story of a murderous fruitcake snapping and dragging down his own children into his madness is INFINITELY more disturbing to me than the story of a family being chosen by God to become His avenging angels. Why? Because the first one is not only good, but perfectly believable, of course! With that twist, a story that was working very well as a terrifying dysfunctional family drama becomes supernatural fantasy, and simply stops being interesting.Others comments have pointed out that maybe what we see at the end is not a revelation of the truth, but just Adam's deranged point of view. So, for example, when we see the crimes of the ""demons"" being revealed when they are touched, it's just Adam imagining things. That would have been fine too. But things like the videotape screwup and agent Hull not remembering Adam's face seem to underline that something unexplainable is going on, and that bothers the hell out of me. All I can do is cling to the hope that what happened to the tape was simply a highly-unlikely-but-theoretically-possible freak accident, and that Hull actually did recognize Adam (when the zoom thing happens around his face), but didn't say anything and instead went to get some backup to come back and arrest him after the credits had started to roll...",Frailty
145,dutchchocolatecake,very chilling,10,8 October 2013,"I want to get one thing straight - I am not giving this a 10 star review because I like the movie. I am giving this a 10 star review because it does something that most movies cannot - it scared the crap out of me. I'd give it more stars if I could for the superb acting, directing, and original story this movie offers.This movie absolutely chilled me to the bone. I couldn't stop thinking ""people like this actually exist."" I think that's the most terrifying part of the movie is that this kind of thing is not unheard of. This movie outlines the psychopathy of killers that can be found in many case files around America.The one quality that stands out for me, is how horrifying this movie is without the typical foul language and other cliché plot devices found in other horror movies. It doesn't need that tripe as it outclasses itself with substance; and the directing gives it the style that grabs the viewer and won't let go until the terrifying end.So if you're looking for something different, and more psychological in nature give this one a try.",Frailty

147,raymond-massart,A divine mission,8,30 October 2005,"This movie was shown on TV as part of a Halloween ""Frite-Nite"" weekend. It is definitely very scary in the sense that it doesn't fit into the special effects horror genre but succeeds in creating an uncomfortable sense of stifling claustrophobia: the psychic prison in which the characters are entrapped is given an extra dimension by limiting the main scenes to four basic locations (the house, shed, cellar and rose garden) that bathe in an eerie form of lighting. Bill Paxton is excellent as the possessed father who continuously tries to convince his sons of his divine mission: the great thing here is that his tormented facial expression seems to convey that deep down he might be struggling to figure out if it is really the voice of God that dictates his deeds or if he is subject to an increasing form of madness. Matt O'Leary is outstanding in his extremely difficult role as the young Fenton who desperately attempts to hold on to his sanity.The constant tension arising from the contradiction between the genuine family ties- initially based on love and respect- and the frustrating effects caused by the violence that ensues, constitute the thread on which the entire movie is based.A certain number of viewers do not feel comfortable with the many twists in the plot towards the end. This is understandable as up to a certain point,the story develops very smoothly whereas too many new elements are crammed into the final scenes. Apart from these possibly disputable remarks, the movie certainly deserves a special mention. One final note on the title ""Frailty': it is most likely a reference to human frailty in general,whereby it is always difficult to fully understand what mental processes motivate our own acts, let alone those of others.",Frailty
148,khouston86,I loved it. Ignore the review on the title page.,10,28 February 2003,"I loved this movie, and I think it will go down as a classic.  It really drew me in from the first scene and never let go.  Contrary to some of the recent reviews here, Paxton was great as the father.  The whole cast, especially Matthew McConaughey, was wonderful.  Amazing atmosphere, tight, original story with surprises, and obvious care in the movie-making process make this a special movie.       IMDB, why do you let a particular person have the spotlight review here and on so many movies?  As usual, his review is pretentious and wrong.",Frailty
149,botfeeder,very twisty,8,7 October 2020,"I first gave this a 7, but after reading some reviews I realized an important part of the story blew by me, that the ""demons"" really were demons. I rewound to the spot where I wasn't paying attention- that showed the ""demons"" were in fact murderers.That the psychos in a psycho film would turn out to be exacting what appeared to be deranged rage against people who turned out not to be innocent victims but evil people seems pretty original to me, and puts this movie way outside the standard formula of the genre. It seems to me there's no need to peg Adam and his dad as good guys or bad guys, the supernatural element of this movie, the ability of the two to ""see"" that people have committed murder, renders them unjudgeable.However, the murder of of an innocent person, the sheriff, as a byproduct of their demon hunting imperative, does put a stain on their character that can't really be washed away.What about Fenton? It would seem to me he's a good guy. He didn't see the demons so he reacted as a decent person would to the behavior of his father. Unless he committed his own spree of murders, which Adam mentioned to the detective, but I assumed that was just part of Adam's deflection of his deeds onto Fenton.",Frailty

I was pleasantly surprised.The plot is told in flashback mode, and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be, in the very least, surprised.All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job directing those kids, and his acting is awesome. McConaughey's acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly.This movie challenges you to think. Is Dad crazy? Is there a God? Do Demons exist? How far would you go to right a wrong. And what is ""right"" anyway? I'm still thinking.And thus I recommend ""Frailty"". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second, or even third viewing.",Frailty
151,axapvov,"great cast, great story telling, poor twist",6,14 January 2018,"The good: 
Surprisingly good storytelling. At first I thought this would be yet another by-product of 90´s thriller epidemic but it is engaging against all odds, a page-turner indeed. It takes its time and, slowly but firmly, events unfold without noticing the time. It´s low-key and creepier than I expected and the father-son conflict is brilliant.
Very good casting. Bill Paxton (the dad) is very convincing. The boy is excellent too, even the FBI agent was a great choice.
The bad:
The twist and ending turns what could have been a terrific creepy crime drama into a generic tv movie.
Matthew McCounaughey is one of the few actors who can pull off an interesting voice over, but it still is a cheap voice over.
Everything about ""touching demons"" just stinks.

152,jmverville,Genuinely Good Film,8,8 December 2004,"The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, one simply cannot go wrong. The very plot in itself, the very story and essence of the film, is entertaining. It is the sort of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much with, and in this case, he really did do a lot with it.From beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly, quickly, and tightly from one scene to the next. It demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil, in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned as in this case. It also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole.Overall, this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks, but I would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time.",Frailty

154,johanleupen,Intriguing but flawed nonetheless.,7,23 April 2002,"Frailty drew a lot of pre-release attention by citing positive response by big industry names such as writer Stephen King and directors James Cameron and Sam Raimi. Even if you take into account that director Paxton probably befriended Raimi and Cameron while working on their movies, recommendations from these people should count for something. However i found myself disappointed by Frailty nonetheless. The story, told through flashbacks, focusses on Paxton who tries to convince his two sons that he has been chosen by God to fullfill certain devine tasks, namely the killing of demons disguised as ordinary human beings. The film contains some unintentionally funny scenes in which Paxton enthousiastically tries to convey his vision on his oldest son, who tells him he might just be a little nuts. The movie subsequently wastes a lot of time divulging on the worsening family-situation and leaves the audience craving for some kind of direction. Also, child actors Sumpton and O'Leary deliver unimpressive performances, sabotaging scene after scene while Paxton's desillusionment & despair-routine becomes really tiresome after a while. Luckily, salvation (if you will excuse the pun) comes in the form of a very surprising and satisfying ending, rounding off the story. Having said that, i still deplore Paxton's tendency to rely on this ending for the succes of his entire film. Had he spend more time trying to make the (overlong) set-up an intriguing premise in itself (without just expecting the ending to make things right) then the result would have been far more satisfactory.",Frailty
155,srobi280,Wow...,10,7 April 2006,"Stunning. Absolutely stunning. This is a movie about two kids who's father suddenly has a vision. He claims an angel visits him, and tells him that they need to kill ""demons"". He gets instructions later, and they start rounding up the demons, which are, to the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head, and chop them up, burying them in the rose-garden. Their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. The movie continues, with a twist at the end.The thing that I love about this movie, is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception. Is their father completely mad? Or, is he telling the truth? The audience is left to decide. Go make the judgment for yourself, and see the movie. Now.",Frailty

157,Surecure,Strong directorial debut for Paxton and effective thriller,8,15 May 2005,"Bill Paxton is certainly one of Hollywood's hardest to define actor. While he is not nearly as eye-catching in his performances on screen as someone such as Anthony Hopkins or even Bill Pullman (the person he is most confused with) he is certainly one of Hollywood's hardest working and entertaining performers.Frailty marks his debut as a director and one has to give him significant credit for crafting what is an exceptionally well rounded, Gothic thriller. Paxton has certainly learned a great deal by working with some of the modern masters of Hollywood style film-making such as James Cameron and Sam Raimi, and it shows in every second of this beautifully filmed and perfectly paced thriller.The performances by all of the actors in this film are above par. Matthew McConaughey is a powerful presence in this film, completely shedding the image that he has in pop film culture to portray a dark and conflicted young man. Powers Boothe evens out McConaughey's darkness with a stone confidence and authority that grounds the film in a normal, everyday reality, thus increasing the effectiveness of the film's suspense. Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter offer performances well beyond their years that truly commands the audience's attention. Add to this Bill Paxton's double duty as director and lead performer and this film is easily actor's level entertainment.Frailty is easily one of the best thrillers in recent years and certainly ranked (as even Roger Ebert labeled it) as one of the best films to be released in 2002. One hopes that Paxton will return to being behind the camera someday soon, as he most certainly holds a lot of promise in that role.",Frailty
158,majic-5,Wacko or disciple? You choose.,7,11 November 2007,"Frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion/obsession straight into depravity. Dad (we never learn his name) is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after Mom died giving birth to the youngest son, Adam. The family's world flips upside down late one night when Dad rushes into the boys' room and tells them God has given him a vision. And what a vision  the entire family's job is to destroy demons, who, of course, are disguised in human form.Proceeding from this premise, the movie is unflinching in following it. Dad kidnaps people/demons whom God has told him to destroy, binds them, lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil, then kills them  while making his young sons watch. Fenton, the older boy, is horrified, seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer. Adam, the younger, is uncomfortable, but trusts that Dad is following God's will. Eventually, Dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the ""demons"" that God has put on Dad's list, and finally, invites them to fully participate in God's mission for the family.This is not, you understand, an abusive father. He loves his children. He is only following God's instructions: ""This is our job now, son. We've got to do this."" When Fenton, terrified and convinced his father has gone mad, says he'll report him to the police, his father explains, ""If you do that, son, I'll die. The angel was clear on this."" The pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic, and warps their entire lives.(1) The movie's structure is similar to the one used in The Usual Suspects: a story in flashback, told in a police station to a FBI agent. The moody lighting, the stormy weather, and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory. I wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story, until I remembered the real-life parallel of Andrea Yates, who believed she was possessed by Satan and could save her children by drowning them. Even then, I wanted to believe that I was watching a human tragedy, rather than a story of divine retribution.The movie gave me no such comfort, though, as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of Dad's vision. And this, as much as some plot holes, posed a problem for me. Regardless of the accuracy of Dad's visions, regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed, where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death?

I bought the DVD without previously watching the movie (I will never do that again), I was hesitant but once I saw the endorsements from Stephen King, Sam Raimi and James Cameron among others on the DVD case I figured I was in for a good film. How wrong I was.Bill Paxton is my favorite actor and thankfully most of the lack of excitement in this movie comes neither from his acting or his directing, it comes from the writers.  For those who haven't seen the movie there are several twists at the end, unfortunately they are very unsatisfying because the previous 90 minutes of the movie are boring!!!  I think the writers realized that the movie was awful so created the twists to make up for it.I was surprised to see that the movie is listed as a horror movie on the DVD case.  From the trailers I expected it to be a thriller, it is neither.  The movie contains no scares, let alone suspense, it's not even disturbing due to one of the twists at the end (which I won't reveal).  There also aren't any thrills so it's just as well it's not a thriller.  The twists at the end are predictable.  I rarely, if ever, guess how a movie is going to end, as I enjoy being surprised but in this case the twists were so apparent because the movie is so dull up until the final 10 minutes that you figure something has got to happen.I think the worst part of it is the endorsements.  If Raimi, King and Cameron think this is a good horror movie then what do we have to look forward to from them in the future?  I think the reviews are a little too ""friendly"" as Paxton has appeared in several Cameron films and was in Indian Summer with Raimi.I am a big fan of horror, not gore, so it wasn't the absence of blood which disappointed me.  The fact that the murders were being committed in the name of God wasn't enough to scare or disturb me and the twist at the end just made the whole movie absurd.  Perhaps I will find more to enjoy in the movie on subsequent viewings (seeing as I own it I might as well watch it again), now that my expectations of the movie have been significantly lowered.

164,MyDarkStar,Bill Paxton shines,6,25 December 2002,"Bill Paxton just continuous to impress me with his career. I mean, can't you just remember when he was in ""Weird Science"" as the jerk brother? Then he was in ""Aliens"" as Private Hudson screaming ""They're all over the place!"". Since then he got even more popular with roles in ""Apollo 13"", ""Twister"". But even more so, he has progressively taken on more demanding roles, and he has delivered. ""A Simple Plan"" showed him in a new light, as did ""U-571"".Now there's ""Frailty"". Besides the possibility of this being his best acting performance, this is without a doubt one of the most impressive directorial debuts by an actor I have seen in recent times. Paxton really grabs the viewer and leads him down an intriguing path in which you really don't know what to believe and disbelieve. He even makes references to the likes of Hitchcock.Most of the criticisms I've read regarding this film center upon the writing of it. Some didn't agree with the use of the twist at the end. I liked the twist(s). I liked them a lot! Either way, whether you liked the twists or not, you still have to agree that this is a very impressive directorial debut for Paxton.

I wish my sense had such extra perception.This isn't mindless drabble.  It's a thought piece with solid acting throughout, disturbing images and though I would have to agree it's not quite as suspenseful, perhaps it wasn't meant to keep a viewer totally on the seat's edge.  Perhaps it was meant to tell a twisted little tale through 'til the end.  It's more difficult to keep that razor's edge of suspense when you might have a pretty good idea of where your next scene might be heading--for more of the same stuff.  Only, I didn't feel it monotonous, more at drawing the viewer in, and it did me.For an extra treat, the DVD offers up some fine commentary and revealing portraits like the Sundance channel's ""Anatomy of a Scene.""  Overall, I thought it was thought provoking, original, well directed and well acted. 
For my one little *spoiler*, and this is for the viewer who thought it ""a glaring inconsistency,"" the lack of relation between ""Adam"" and the girl at the police station--I want to not be too awfully cruel, but watch it again and pay closer attention.

This film also stars Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe (as FBI Agent). I have to give two thumbs up to the actor (Matthew O'Leary) who portrays Paxton's older son because he does a great job. Basic Plot: Paxton gets a message from God that he and his two sons are to perform God's Hands and destroy the demons among them. But the demons are everyday people who end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. According to Paxton, these people are actual demons who have committed sin and must be destroyed. The selection process is via a message from God to Paxton through a list. Sounds quite fanatical right? The film tells this elaborate, horrific tale through the narration of one of Paxton's grown sons years later. He's got a confession to make and you'll have to wait until the surprise ending to know what it is. Smells like Memento! The scary thing about this film is that there are actually religious fanatics who have used God to justify their crimes. ""God told me to"" The even scarier thing about this film and the only thing I did not like. These fanatics may actually view the film for more then it is and think they are doing the World a favor by carrying out God's Word. You'll know what I'm talking about at the end of the movie.

Until I saw Frailty Mel Gibson was the only well known actor whose presence behind the camera impressed me.Frailty was absolutely brilliant.  From beginning to end Powers Boothe and Matthew take us on a remarkable piece of storytelling.  The end comes complete with a series of intellegent twists.  We realise the one we were feeling so much sympathy for was the one we should have been despising.The cinematography and production work are unrivaled in film since True Romance, and only recently rivaled by the Christopher Nolan masterpiece, Insomnia.Films like this give me faith in modern American film, but the fact that this film was not honored in any way by the Academy tell me the cold hard truth.

175,easmith03,"Suspenseful, I was left guessing until the (disappointing) ending.",6,1 May 2002,"Fine performances for all of the performers, and a clever unique plot had me glued to the movie.  There was very little gore, and almost no scenes of people jumping out of the dark to try and startle the viewer.  The plot was revealed mostly through flash back, and I found myself intrigued by the story as it unraveled.  However, you come realize that as the story was ""told"", you have been relying on the honesty of the story teller for all that you know... which helps builds suspense, and setup some twists towards the ending.My only comment on the ending is that there were a couple of different choices for a conclusion, and I think I would have been more satisfied with a different one.",Frailty
176,snake77,"Dark, scary and really good",7,7 October 2002,"I put off seeing this movie when it came out in theatres, because it got some mixed reviews and Bill Paxton has never impressed me too much with his choices as an actor.  I figured a movie directed by him would most likely be late-night cable quality at best.  Well, Mr. Paxton I owe you an apology.  I forgot you have actually been in some good movies (One False Move, A Simple Plan) and must have been paying attention along the way.  Frailty is a truly chilling and well directed horror/thriller set in modern day Texas.  
The story starts off intriguingly: a mysterious late night visitor to the Dallas FBI claims to have information about a notorious serial killer. A FBI agent interviews him and hears a strange 20 year old story about how the man's seemingly normally small town family went suddenly, horribly crazy and his brother ended up a murderer. The FBI man listens patiently but he's thinking what you the viewer are probably thinking - things just may not be what they seem.  Matthew McConaughey, Powers Boothe, Paxton and especially young Matthew O'Leary give really good performances.  Director Paxton creates a great dark, atmospheric look for the film and never rushes the story -  I think pacing is probably the hardest thing to do in movies and he's obviously got the knack. The script is well written and has enough surprises to keep you guessing right to the end.  It might be too darkly intense and menacing for everyone (my wife was squirming) but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. If you like the ones that make you shiver, this is the film for you.",Frailty
177,jeffronthi,"Great Debut, Bill",7,13 September 2008,"Probably a 6.5, but you'll remember it nonetheless. This film was a solid debut of actor/director Bill Paxton.A few cinematic crimes were perpetrated during the making of this film: 1) Where this film leads you, suspense wise, is quite obvious, to say the least; 2) They say the acting of this film is great, but I find it to be quite mediocre. In fact, I know it is mediocre. I sat through an hour and a half of it; 3) It takes on a ""demons are real"" tone, to make up for the fact that the film is going to get a bit unbelievable towards the middle. This film relied on old biblical mythology to do its work.Visually and pathologically this film works, however, as the set-designers and director (the underrated Bill Paxton) work hand-in-hand to make it up with atmosphere and a creepy Gothic feel. It is vusually stunning for its budget.Bill Paxton delivers a decent performance, but not up to his best. That is understandable, as he was also the director. Even so, it is what it is. The kids were kids, obviously, overacting all the way. More so with the younger sibling (I forget his name). They were fun.If it weren't for the obviousness of the story, it would have been close to an 8.Good job, Bill.",Frailty

It took a great film and used a hackneyed device and ruined it. I don't know why they couldn't just trust they plot to play itself out. I also thought the form of the father's madness was a bit too predictable and not terribly realistic. The lead character's performance was very good. RIP Bill Paxton and Powers Boothe.",Frailty
179,pifas,Such a good tale of suspense,5,24 October 2002,"This one´s a film that knows how to generate tension and suspense. It's an excellent narrated drama that once you witnessed the main plot twist, resembles pretty much -in a good way- to a Jorge Luis Borge's short story called La forma de la espada (The shape of the sword). This one fact serves to enhance even more the experience of watching the film.The movie starts with the credits showing on the background that there's been some killings in southern USA, by a murderer known as The hands of God. Then, we see a man on a FBI office who's willing to speak about (and tell the nature) of the crimes. While he's guiding the detective to a scene place from the back seat in the patrol, we're told on the trip -by himself- about his family, and how everything started back in 1979. The family consisted on two sons and a father who lost his wife when she delivered the second one. Then one night, the father, a loving and caring one, had a vision where he was revealed as the chosen one to assume, with his two sons, the task of killing demons in human shape on earth. He tells his two sons, and just by this event, soon starts the fears in the elder one that brings down all sense of security and the whole world with it. And it's consequences are horrible. Enough said of the plot, in order to avoid spoilers.I'll just finish by saying that Frailty is a such a good story, told in a very wise way. Paxton (directing and acting), knows exactly how to get you, first by the events, then by making you wait for the end because there's not a solid clue in sight. Here's no room for graphic violence, killings or lots of blood, but, who cares? Instead, we find ourselves caring for the people involved in this thriller that, in one point, starts to unveil before our very own eyes as a deadend street -again, in a good way-, that makes us guess a lot. Sure it may be a little slow paced much of the time, but it never becomes boring or a tedious one. Besides, it leaves the door open for any explanation we like giving to ourselves. Such a great film.",Frailty
180,aztrshbyz,A good thriller with an incredibly mixed message,8,17 August 2017,"The movie FRAILTY concerns a father has a vision one night, sent to him by an angel, that he and his young sons have been chosen to kill demons who are hiding as humans. The movie opens with one of the sons, who states his name is Fenton, telling the F.B.I. agent who is handling the ""God's Hands Killer"" case that he knows who the murderer is. He is not believed initially, but by the end of the movie is able to prove to the agent that he does indeed know who is responsible. The film is generally done in a flashback style with most of the movie concerning Fenton's version of the family's history, how the killings began and continued and what happened when the father realized that Fenton wasn't buying into what his father and brother Adam were saying and doing. He is forced to minimally participate, but refuses to be involved in the actual killings and is subsequently punished by his father. Only when Fenton states he has received a vision as well is he considered to be safe by his father. He has come forward now because he doesn't want to carry around what he knows anymore. Other people have written about the last 1/4 of the film, so I won't spoil it here. Suffice it to say that the plot takes a lot of twists and turns towards the end and rather than taking place in flashback, is done in present day.Overall, I thought the movie was really well done with convincing performances by most of the cast. I do have to say I'm not a fan of Powers Boothe so it would be tough for me to write a fair review of how he did in the film - that being said, I liked the way he played his character the least.This film is not a horror movie in the true sense of the word. It is more of a crime thriller/drama as indicated in IMDb. It is suspenseful, however, and really works well in that regard. There are things that are very easy to miss at first watching. Keep your eyes and ears peeled. I don't want to mention them specifically, but in watching parts of the film a second time things become less muddy leading up to the movie's finish.The only thing I didn't like about FRAILTY was the very end - I had a lot of difficulty with what I felt the message of the movie was and what it appears to support. I won't say anything further than that other than the fact that I found it very disturbing, maybe as it was meant to be.Bottom line is that it is a good crime thriller and would be a good choice for fans of crime and suspense, however, be aware that the ending might be a little hard to swallow for some.",Frailty

Well acted (child actors can ruin films but the kids in this are excellent) and whilst the production values are fairly average the perfect pacing of the story and the character development is top notch. The leads (Paxton and Mchouaghey) are terrific and entirely believable.

There is no monsters, or CGI all over the place, there is no scaries or shadows moving here and there, just a brutal story about faith and the supranatural. It is not a religious movie also. It is one of the most amazing debuts you can imagine in an actor as Bill Paxton, a remarkable actor and a very fine director. Matty O'Leary makes an impressive chartactrization of the young Felton Meiks, a superb performance of a teenager as you very rare see in a movie. I did not tell the plot, because is just mindblowing, with a very dark tone on the humane nature. If you want to see a horror movie that scares you, this is not your kind of film, but definetively scares the hell out of you like very few films today.

188,Harrismh,"A dark, blood curdling yarn with strong style similarities to Momento, the 2001 mind twister.",7,19 May 2002,"-POSSIBLE SPOILER--Frailty is the story of serial murders in a small Texas town.  The tale opens when Fenton Meiks [Matthew McConaughey] walks into the Dallas FBI office to tell the story of the 1970's era killings.  Agent Wesley Doyle [Powers Boothe] listens as the story unfolds.  Flashback some 30 years to the Meiks family; Fenton, younger brother Adam and Dad [Matthew O'Leary, Jeremy Sumpter and Bill Paxton, respectively] live a `Leave It To Beaver' life.  The family unit is honest, hardworking, caring and reverent. Fenton cooks dinner and Dad helps the boys with homework; Mom has died some years ago.  One evening Dad has a vision where angels direct him to kill demons. Tools of the trade and designated demons are made know to him.  The father easily influences Adam, but Fenton is not so quickly engaged; none the less, the brothers are bonded by murder.  The story that follows closes the loop between Fenton the younger and the man being interviewed by the FBI.
Frailty is a dark, blood curdling yarn with strong style similarities to Momento, the 2001 mind twister.  This story is grounded in considerable religious doctrine; whereas, Momento relied upon a psychological theme. This is one of those movies that, as the end approaches, you wish you'd paid more attention at the beginning.  Enough said.  The movie is being compared to the likes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre [1974] and that's misleading. Frailty is much more about the darker side of parent / child relationships and how kids do / do not react to an errant parent.  The film also helps explain why Texans as a culture subscribe to the death penalty.
Frailty is actor Paxton' debut as a director and he makes the cut. Paxton, the director, appropriately typecasts himself in a lead role as the multifaceted father under the influence.  The sweet spot in the movie is the young actors, Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter, who play the juvenile Meiks brothers.  O'Leary in particular is perfect as the defiant but scared teen who is torn between parental dedication and `doing the right thing'.",Frailty

This was quite an undertaking for an actor to a first time Director. The subject matter alone could bury a lesser soul and send him into oblivion. The movie was paced and spookie and dark and swirling, and the musical score kept you numb. The idea of a Dad telling his son's, (whom he loves, and in no way mistreats) that they have to help him kill these demons who look like humans, but are not.""An angel came to me and told me that we have to fulfill God's wish to kill these people"" Paxton plays this as a matter-of-fact thing we have to do. There is no ranting and raving and out of control yelling, just the soft spoken Dad, like saying heh, kids were going fishing in the morning. The older son Fenton thinks Dad is just kidding and tells his younger brother Adam not to worry everything will be ok in the am. And as the morning progresses the boys assume all is well. But Dad takes them to school and his parting shot is , be ready boys and remember what I told you last night. That night Dad brings home the first victim.II was raised in a small town in Calif. and there were scenes in this movie that reminded me of this town. As it was a very religious community and had its Holy-Rollers that would come to town in the summer and pitch huge tents. And on a clear summers-hot night you could hear them way across-town. Breathing fire and damnation. When I looked at the credits for this movie I found out that some of the movie was shot in my home town. ( Sorry I digress. )But this movie really spooked mme and made me think of times I was spooked in that town as a 9 yo.Everyone in this movie was outstanding. Please do not let the reviewers who compare this movie to Resident Evil, ugh,turn you off it is a real thriller without the loud bangs and all the murders happen off screen, so there is no blood except on clothing. Its rated R, but I wouldn't take anyone under 13 to see it.  I will never look at an OTIS ax in the same way, again. I gave this much admired film (9)",Frailty

Fenton and Adam's Dad comes homes from work and tells his sons that he's been given a holy vision telling him about demons walking around in human form. He believes he his sons are the front line in the war against hell on Earth. Fenton is skeptical of his Dad and Adam enthusiastically agrees with him.

The whole movie is primarily shown in flashback mode and the story revolves around a father who supposedly found God and was told by Him to go out and kill demons. Demons that take human form. This movie can get pretty gruesome at times but its worth watching. One BIG problem- the ending- in order to believe the ending, you'll have to forget everything you've seen in the last hour and a half. I'm not going to give any more away but you'll see.

I was disappointed. This movie is not horror, or mystery, but simply a drama about a series of murders committed by a religious fanatic. The pace is slow, there is no suspense, and the acting is flat by Mr. Paxton and Mr. Boothe. The young men can be forgiven for their acting deficits.The story had promise. If it had been told as a police investigation as in the serial killer movie ""Seven"" with Morgan Freeman it would have been better.Instead we get a plodding flashback screenplay which takes too long in its scenes and doesn't develop any tension or fear.The ""victims"" shown are never developed so we never fear for them. There is no real gore or torture to generate revulsion.The screenplay is just moribund and flat, and I didn't really care about the people involved. One reviewer made a comparison to ""Silence of the Lambs"", but there is no comparison here. There is no eeriness about this film, simply the flat portrayals of some warped individuals and some thematic references to ""the Dead Zone"".This type of crime scenario could not have happened in small-town America---- at least not one with an FBI office near it!",Frailty

195,knersisman,Frailty,8,17 December 2018,"This movie is very well done, but very morbid and tragic. It portrays the dangers of religious fanaticism with a fast-paced narrative. The movie succeeds in provoking an intense feeling of empathy for the two children affected by their father's paranoid delusions of being ""chosen by God to execute demons"". The children lend a hand in the murders, but at the same time they are also victims, especially the youngest boy who is very naive and basically worships the ground his father walks on. There are a few twists in the plot that is very well woven into the narrative and the ending is very strange, yet powerful.",Frailty
196,tcdarkness,Probably a better film if you know nothing of it,7,29 May 2002,"As with some other reviewers of the film Frailty, I agree that the less you know about it going in, the better the movie is.  I don't know this for sure, since I've already seen it now, but even from the previews they tell you that there is some kind of twist ending.  If you know that going in, you look for it.  And a friend and I got about 90% of the twist[s] right when we were 1/3 into the movie.  But I'm not sure he knew there was a twist in that, so maybe he assumed there would be.  The film would have been pretty flat without it, so it is natural to assume that there had to be something in there at the end, especially in a era with twist endings in many slower-paced thrillers like The Sixth Sense and Memento.  This film does not reach the level of those two, but it is a tense film regardless.****SPOILERS**** Once you find the twist, you do see clues to it in the story.  But I noticed the two situations where the truth could be revealed (regarding how they ""see"" demons) in present day right off the bat.  Right in the beginning, 'Fenton' shrugs off the FBI agent's handshake quite coldly and then later on refuses to let the agent put the cuffs on him, opting to do it to himself. Another clue my friend pointed out halfway through the film regarded certain characters' hair colors.  Fenton is a dark-haired boy in the earlier scenes and is blonde when Adam has replaced him in present day.  Same goes for Adam, a blonde in the past but a darker color when his brother supposedly hears him kill himself.  I'm sure there were more clues, but those certainly tipped us off early on. ****END SPOILERS****The direction is good at making the story dark.  I see a lot of classic thriller-element shots in there, like a character bending over and there is a certain person behind him wielding a blunt object toward his head.  Also good is how Paxton decides not to make the film a splatter-fest.  From the sound (which is superb) and the characters' reactions as they slay 'demons' we can tell that the demons have been beheaded without needing the good old fashioned rolling head or blood flying in six-foot arcs.The acting is very good, but the two boys who played younger Fenton and Adam Meiks (the Meiks shall inherit the Earth?) didn't seem that believable at first, when talking about girls and the usual stuff for kids their age. Their believability (and seemingly their acting ability) changes as the story goes on, which makes the film better.  When 'Dad' asks Fenton if he saw God while locked in the cellar, his answer was wickedly delivered.For me, this film worked well without the twist.  Because I could figure out what most of the twist was, it make the story (the present-day storyline) fall flat.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.",Frailty
197,froboz,Entertaining masterpiece,10,17 October 2002,"Frailty is a rare masterpiece, a quaint horror-thriller that will chill you. As it is plot-driven, one should avoid even to read or hear a little bit about the movie before watching. Even if I don't expect movies to get better than this, the trend towards twisted plots is annoying. It makes any sensible discussion about a movie a spoiler. Go back through the years...consider Night of the Hunter. It has similarities in ambience. It even has a plot twist! But you could go into details about that movie without ever spoiling it. It has a natural depth where Frailty has shallowness, and I do think this shallowness comes from focusing on plot. When I think about it, we've seen a couple of dozen fantastic movies in the last couple of years, and they are all ridden by this very same plague. I guess, in the future, when people will see that a movie from around y2k is on the telly, they will avoid it, thinking ""oh no, it probably got computer graphics and plot twists"". Meanwhile, we are in the middle of it and used to it, and you don't get better movies than Frailty these days...and it does *not* contain the omnipotent cheesy computer graphics.",Frailty

200,pywrit,Not what I expected,8,15 October 2002,"I went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack-and-slash films rampant on the screen these days.  Boy, was I surprised.  This little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber, dark atmosphere.  More surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown.  As with most good movies, this one leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a superb job at directing.  Scenes shot inside the car as are well done and, after watching the ""Anatomy of a Scene"" episode at the end of the video tape, It was good to see that some of the subtle, yet wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just an ""Oh, that looks good, keep it"" type of direction.  This is a moody movie, filled with grimness. Still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes.  The acting is exceptional (Okay, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never goes over the top.  Au Contraire, it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film.  If there is any one area where this film lacks, it is in the ending, which seems just a bit too contrived, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie.  What is the message?  It's something that each individual decides for themself. Overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre (ie: ""Body Heat"" or ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil""), and about a 5 for those who don't.",Frailty

God's Hand is the name a serial killer has given his murders, and we find out why.  We find out the strange mans name is Fenton Meiks(Matthew McConaughey), and he claims to know who the God's Hand killer is.  He tells the agent that he beleives it's his brother, Adam Meiks.  We are then took through a entire journey through is his childhood and how me comes to know this information. When him and his brother were kids, their father(Bill Paxton), began telling him that God and angles visited him in his dreams, and during the day as well.  He told them that God wanted them to kill 'demons', they where God's Hands and had to fulfill their mission to rid the world of demons. Fenton, who never beleived his father, but Adam beleived his father, even saw the demons along with his father.  The rest of the plot just centers around the relationship between dad and his sons, now especially, about what is going on in their lives.            This movie was directed by Bill Paxton(his first film) and written by Brent Hanley, and is done very well by Paxton for his first time. The story is very strange, it might even offended some people(by some of the religion idea they talk about), but most of all it will entertain you. It's atmosphere is dark and gloomy(to match up with how their lives have been dark and gloomy after the killings began) and the acting is well. Paxton, I feel is the standout performance because of how he brings the father alive, he is completely crazy, or is he?  Questions are also araised during this film, but I will not answer anything for you or give anything away, it will ruin the movie and the twist in the end.  This movie will be trampled by the other large movies coming out within the next few weeks(""The Scorpion King"" and few others) but if you have a chance to see it, don't pass it up.",Frailty

Well scratch that, don't see if you like well written, well directed, interesting, movies.  But you like like movies about demons, or mailer Daemons, this film is for you.  The only draw back, is that it just isn't as funny as Resident Evil.  Much of the dialog is trite, and the movie just isn't scary.  They don't even use those ""cheap scares"" where the build up the music then something from off frame attacks someone.  The ending can be guessed, not so easily, but if you guess the ending to the sixth sense (like me cause i'm awesome) then you won't be impressed.  Also, it almost comes to the point where you don't want to guess the ending, because you just don't care.  Its one of the movies where there's a build up, but no pay off, over and over again.  The film staggers, and becomes repetitive.  The writing is trite and if you can see past the one dimentional characters it falls apart.  The plot isn't even psychologically scarry.  All film analysis aside, it isn't even fun or filled with the cheap thrills.  The suspense isn't really even suspenseful, and there's no double guessing at the end.  Maybe its not terrible, but you're in the mood the for a bill paxton/matthew mccaunehey film, rent Nazi submariner's and why they suck, AKA, U-571.",Frailty

206,missykat,Thriller Reminiscent of Black and White Film Noir,10,7 May 2002,"In the tradition of 'The Usual Suspects', Bill Paxton's directoral debut 'Frailty' is as suspenseful and engaging a film as any I've seen. And like the afore mentioned 'Suspects', does not reveal its secrets until the very end.'Frailty' tells the story of a blue collar single dad (Paxton) who is visited by an angel in a vision. The angel tells him that he and his sons have been chosen to kill demons, disguised as ordinary people, here on earth. We watch horrified as he commits these murderous acts of vengeance with the help of his two young sons.I've loved Bill Paxton from as far back as I can remember. One of my personal favorite roles is that of Chet in 'Weird Science', just for the sheer goofiness of the film and the character. But I've paid close attention as he's evolved into one of the finest actors of our time. The best proof of this evolution is arguably the role of Hank Mitchell in 'A Simple Plan', where the question 'What would you do if you found a bag full of money?' is best answered 'Take it to the cops.' Now that Paxton has extended his resume to include directing, let's hope he continues to make such exceptional choices in projects as he has with'Frailty'. Perhaps the actor was first drawn to the script by the sheer torment of the characters. And as many actors-turned-directors will, he lets the actors lead the camera as they involve us further in what's happening to their characters.I must credit Matthew McConaughy and Powers Boothe for their strong performances as well. McConaughy is wonderfully creepy as the grown son of Paxton, confessing the crimes of his family to the sardonic and sinister FBI agent Boothe. I must also give credit here to the younger actors in the film, Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter, who played Paxton's sons as boys. The two were deeply convincing as loyally devoted sons struggling with their father's dark revelations.'Frailty' didn't need special effects to be haunting. But in two scenes, delightfully Hitchcockian by nature, we stand witness as Paxton's character is visited by an angel armed with a firey sword. Then again we watch as darkness envelopes one of the young sons who has been imprisoned in a shed without food for several days by the father. The boy later reveals he's been visited by God, but all we see is the boy's astonished face falling into a pit of blackness. Paxton chose, and rightly so, to allow these scenes to be told without the aid of more complex and flashy effects that would have distracted from the rest of the film.'Frailty' is a disturbing and well crafted film that will absolutely give you chills in all the right places. I won't give anything away, but in one unsuspecting moment I did actually come off my seat in surprise. So will you.",Frailty

212,Kate_Dammit_Run,"Great Movie, Needs Better Ending",9,19 August 2006,"Frailty is a GREAT movie. There should be more horror films like this, based on psychology rather than monsters. In the movie, the FBI are looking for a serial killer in East Texas who calls himself God's Hand. One night Matthew McCaunaghey shows up in a stolen ambulance with a dead body inside and insists on speaking to the agent in charge. He explains that the body is his brother who is the God's Hand Killer and proceeds to tell his life story. McCaunaghey's character grew up with a loving and gentle single father (Paxton). Then, one night, his father wakes up his sons and says that he had a vision from God. God told him that there are ""demons"" in the world and it is his job to ""destroy"" them. Taking a supposedly mystical ax and pair of gloves which he finds by the road, Paxton sets out with his sons to kill ""demons"", in reality people who have sinned in some way. This story forms the bulk of the movie. It's a great psychological thriller about a boy wrestling with the fact that his beloved father is a serial killer, and that his brother may be becoming one too. This part of the movie is great but they felt the need to add a twist ending which, while one of the most genuinely disturbing endings in recent cinema, is also kind of silly and undermines some of the tension of the rest of the film.",Frailty

The acting is strong, the script is tight, Paxton's direction is incredibly crisp and the movie as a whole holds up beautifully after multiple viewings.

Clearly, this opinion is in the minority, but it needs to be said...Story: Attempting to be meaningful, in the end the story devolves upon itself. Did any of the flashback story happen at all? Are we being asked to believe that God really is in the business of directing people to ""destroy demons"" (disguised as actual people) loose in the world? Are we intended to feel that the killer or killers in the movie are actually heroes? That everyone who gets axed (excepting, perhaps, the sheriff) actually deserved it? Or are we not supposed to think about any of this and just go along for the ride?Photography; Watch this one in the dark, but not because it's so much scarier that way. The fact is that you won't be able to make out most of the action because this movie is very poorly lit. Couldn't the script at least have called for a flashlight or two?DVD: Barely worthy of ONE audio commentary, this DVD actually had THREE. Don't know how valuable they are since I couldn't bear to sit through this THREE MORE TIMES to find out.Director: I wanted to yell at the screen ""Pick up the pace!""

Well, taken on the level as a straightforward thriller the movie is more than adequate. And if you were to classify this as a horror film, it would automatically be disintiguished by its talented cast, notable rookie director, and challenging theme. Unfortunately, the film is an utter load of ridiculous spiritual hokum?What is the message here? It seems like a load of bull from the religious right. However, even the religious minded may reject the brutality of the message. Killing ""demons"" in God's name is OK? I don't understand the point of this film. Especially since although many viewers rave about the movies great ""twist"", it's that undisputable moment that utterly ruins the entire film.Had ""Frailty"" condemned the killers, or at least been more ambigious, I would have been fine with this film.

Dad Meiks was a single parent who one day 22 years previously, told his young sons that he had had a vision that they were supposed to kill demons disguised as humans on God's behalf. He enlists his young sons in the task, Adam willingly, Fenton less so. What follows is a mixture of horror, suspense and twists. Whether the last twist works is a matter of personal preference.

Paxton underplays the role to phenomenal success. This is one of his finest performances (and if you've seen ""A Simple Plan"" and ""One False Move"", you know Paxton is capable of excellence).I liked all but one of Paxton's directorial touches (O'Leary's disembodied head in the darkness was one exception).

The plot was uninteresting and unoriginal.  After half an hour, the audience was moking the actors, and everyone was laughing. I payed 12.50 to see this very low quality movie.  I think it's a scandal that the market allows for this to happen: good movies are often disregarded by the large audiences, and bad movies get so much publicity that everyone goes to see them.  Absolutely a no no no movie, wait and rent it at a block buster so you can shut it off when you are sleepy.",Frailty
240,techspec,This film is a good horror film with a great twist at the end.,7,3 May 2004,"My wife always said that the ""slasher"" movies like Friday 13th didn't scare her near as much as the more plausible movies like ""Psycho"". This movie has a somewhat believable plot...and therefore can have you feeling a little tense. Matthew McConaughey plays a character who is turning himself in to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe) for a series of murders committed from childhood. His father (played by Bill Paxton) believed that God showed him ""evil"" people and that he was directed to kill them. In carrying out this mission, the father enlisted his two sons, though one of the sons (Adam) didn't believe in what his father was doing. McConaughey tells Doyle the whole story, then leads him to the secret burial ground.The movie takes an unexpected turn at the end.",Frailty

I'm so glad he did as this is a really good movie I would have regretted to have missed.It's a break from the norm and the young actors Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) and Fenton (Matt O'Leary) played the characters excellently. Bill Paxton direction was fantastic, there wasn't a dull moment in the film which made me want to take a break from.Like my friend did with me I would strongly recommend this film to anyone.I still fail to understand how can people rate a good movie as this one less than 5, never mind 1.

The film is quite interesting - and even exciting - but how are we supposed to understand the ending? I won't tell anything about the last scenes by respect for those who haven't seen the film yet, but I'd like to read some other viewers' opinions about them. Did Paxton want to be ironical? Or is he actually a religious redneck fanatic? The end of the movie is far too ambiguous to allow me to answer these questions. Hey, Bill!

Character development is good, as is the acting all round, especially  the eldest child of the two, but what elevates this film above the post Sixth Sense films, is the excellent screenplay.

Up until the last 15 minutes or so, I was sure that this will not be a wasted time at all. I was glued to the screen. I kept waiting for an ending that will satisfy a normal atheist mind, and finally show on screen what no movie has shown before: THAT THERE IS NO GOD! But, the ending did exactly the opposite! The final message from the film literally is: God exists, there are demons among us, and believers should, in fact, kill those demons. And I will most likely be among those ""demons"".

It's not really ""scary"" but more suspenseful. The 2 child actors, Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter, are totally incredible. They were very convincing and gave some of the best child performances I've ever seen. Bill Paxton was also great. I loved how Dad never really went nuts and just stayed normal and sweet and loving, not wanting to do what he has to do but fearful of what will happen if he doesn't. *minor spoiler* I don't care how some people say they guessed the ending in the first five minutes, they're probably the same people who say they guessed the ending of The Sixth Sense in the first five minutes too, well I just don't want to hear it and neither does anybody else! It's filled with lots of twists and surprises along the way and the acting is just so good that it doesn't matter if you guess a few of them because one thing or another is going to shock you along the way.

256,jhb-4,Superb Paxton directorial debut,10,20 April 2002,"FRAILTY is a superb reminder that small films can be among the very best. Bill Paxton's eerie directorial debut is reminiscent of the Charles Laughton classic THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.  His subtle performance in the pivotal role of the father who is called by an ""angel"" to destroy ""demons,"" is just right and obviously inspires truly amazing work from the two young boys, Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter, who are cast as his sons. O'Leary, in particular, gives a stunning performance as the older son who does not fall under his father's spell. Matthew McConoughey turns in fine, understated work as the teller of the tale, as does Powers Boothe in the role of an FBI agent who is the recipient of the grown-up son's narrative. Subdued color photography, recalling the best of the  black-and-white era, and an enveloping use of sound, create a really disturbing atmosphere. And Paxton's restraint in the use of violence, reminds us that the best of ""thrillers"" really thrill because so much is left to the imagination. What one does NOT see is far more frightening than all the bloody mayhem that all the Freddy Kruegers and Jasons will ever present to a too-jaded public. Perhaps my being a Southerner makes FRAILTY work so well for me. Southerners know the mindset that could create these people and situations. This one is for thoughtful adults and mature teens who are looking for provocative ""entertainment"" --- and a real scare! Check out FRAILTY before it gets out of the theaters!! And pick a room with a GREAT sound system!!",Frailty

Bill Paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists.  The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both deliver good performances.  The story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back, then spots in the present, alternating back and forth.

258,wickedragon,A film worthy of more praise,10,16 January 2015,"A fantastic movie, a must see for anyone who like their films toned dark, but with a happy ending. Sort of. Maybe.First, let me just say that I think the cinematography of the movie is perfection. It starts slow, and builds towards the crescendo throughout the movie. It's baby steps, baby steps. Each scene preparing you for the next to be slightly wilder until, in the end, the peak is reached and you are ready for it. The score is very well chosen. For the most of the movie it is kept in the background, building on the emotion of the scene; strengthening it. But it is brought to the foreground on a few occasions, making the music in those select few scenes noticeable and strong.The actors all do a stellar job. There is some melodrama, which I find very fitting for the story. Much cudos goes to Jeremy Sumpter and Matt O'Leary for the roles as the kids. Most kid actors manage to hit my nerves in record time, but in this movie the kids as well did a stellar job.",Frailty
259,pardy_travis,Not frail,8,16 April 2003,"This movie is very disturbing. Watching it alone with the lights off is not a good idea (I found out). The visuals are quite unnerving at the beginning credits, the music is right out of the X-Files (only not as science-fiction-y), and Bill Paxton gives a stand-out performance of a career. He also directed the film, which some would call arrogant and others would call intelligent. He knew what he wanted of his actors, and he would be the perfect choice for the lead role since he knew what he wanted. He also may be trying to steal the show. This however is not possible, as the real performance is given by the children, particularly O'Leary. The film does get a bit too bizarre near the end, as unexplainable events keep popping up that weren't there for the rest of the movie. However, these events only add to the film's mysterious atmosphere. Matthew McConaughey does an excellent job of being just creepy enough to know something is not right with him, but not so creepy that we know exactly what is going on with him. The film has a budget and it shows. Scenes that could've done with a little gore are clean as a whistle (except for the obvious splash-back of blood on Paxton's clothes, shown after the murder scenes). The script is something else, despite a fairly predictable coup-de-gras, bit twist ending. The editing is great and the shots are so unique and just plain out-there, you have to wonder if this is actually Paxton's first venture as a director.Basically, go out and see it, because it's worth it.",Frailty

I find Bill Paxton managed a tour-de-force in his directorial debut with this discomforting motion picture. With a cast of talented actors which bring such solid performances, this film is sure to satisfy the twisted-minded horror fans (such as I), and to chill the faint of heart.HERE ARE SOME SPOILERS!!!I mean imagine this, you live your normal kid life, you have a widowed father who loves you and takes care of all your needs, tucks you in bed, almost acts as your best friend and is always there for you. You'd think he is the perfect father. Well think again! Daddy's gone a little wacko overnight and now thirsts for a killing spree, for he believes he is given a ""MISSION"" from God to slay people (whom he thinks are possessed by demons). For Fenton, his father is a psycho, but for his little brother Adam, he's a superhero.That film really has an intrigue to it all, once you start watching it, you totally get drawn into it. Is the father insane, are the victims innocent and picked at random, or is there something beneath it all, that lies deeper than meets the eye...",Frailty

I always enjoy seeing Bill Paxton in just about anything whether it's Big Love, Weird Science or Aliens, but seeing him as a widowed, blue-collar type of small cult leader is just icing on the cake. And having the story narrated through a fully-clad Matthew McConaughey makes you realize that when given the chance, he can really show some chops. Small-town Texas, religion, sanity vs. insanity, family ties, and loyalty. And to top it all off, a well-crafted and satisfying ending that leaves the viewer with an evil grin.",Frailty

264,Vultural,Ohhh....the Frailty of youth.,5,28 June 2009,"It has been a rather annoying trend in recent cinema that most Horror/ Thriller films depend solely on gore to provide shocks for the audience. It is commendable then that Frailty (the directional debut of actor Bill Paxton) is a film that makes a point of steering clear of this trend, and to great effect.Story-wise Frailty is nothing special. The film follows the young life of Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey and Matt O'Leary) and his brother Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) as their father (Bill Paxton) puts together a string of murders in what he believes to be his god given mission to rid the world of demons. From the start it is clear the film is building up to some event or revelation, and to start with the film does a good job of keeping the audience interested. This is mainly down to the engagement we feel with the characters, something that must be largely attributed to the brilliant acting of the two young stars of the film and the surprisingly solid turn from McConaughey.This same level of interest is maintained throughout the film's first two thirds as it plays out as more of a drama than a thriller, demonstrating the strain of such traumatising events on a young lives. The film however stumbles in the final third. The ""twists"" of the film don't live up to there build up as they turn out to be what you were expecting all along. Furthermore the film finishes on a rather disturbing note which slightly distorts the message of all that has gone before it.Despite this i stick by my commendation of the lack of gore in a film that could have exploited it to the highest degree. Instead the audience are treated with the 'what you don't see is more horrifying' approach, which turns out to have chilling effect and compliments the way in which the film explores the characters surrounding the murders rather than the murders themselves. This is then a very promising debut from Bill Paxton.Overall Frailty can be summed up as a film to be admired rather than enjoyed, the acting and direction are both brilliant. It's just a shame that this combination couldn't reel in what is a rather disappointing and messy conclusion to an otherwise good film.5/10",Frailty

To me there was no surprise at the end of The Sixth Sense or The Others. I didn't see this ending coming. You can figure out about 40% of it the rest is amazing.

267,johnwillis49,Great Horror Story but not a horror movie,7,4 December 2013,"So Frailty really does have a pretty great story, very creepy premise with tons of potential.This was Bill Paxtons directing debut so for someones first film its pretty impressive. Very dark tale that really had potential to be a classic of the horror genre but is given a thriller/drama treatment. It could have had the same exact story but through different cinematography and lighting and sound editing been as creepy as it needed to be for the truly disturbing story.Some of the performances were very good particularly Matthew McCounaghey's. The little boy Fenton character was very good at times but not intense enough I felt. The whole movie actually could have been more tense to better serve the story. It is a truly frightening story but the movie didn't heighten this mood. The ""god"" was a little vague and it never mentioned them going to church or even that the dad was religious to begin with but putting that aside still a very intriguing movie with a few flaws.All that said I definitely recommend the movie and will be thinking about it for a while. Nice movie. 7.5/10",Frailty

But, hey, what kid wouldn't want to play somebody who gets to kill somebody with an ax. Wouldn't recommend it though on a regular basis, just to see how Jeremy Sumpter acts only! The movie may been given a 6 by me, but Sumpter's acting if this, I would give an 8, just because the movie was a little bit weird, and why would God have someone go around killing people who have done wrong and our supposed Demons? This was a like a mixture of ""Ghost""(1990) and the Batman movies!",Frailty

Paxton's performance is terrific, but his direction takes ""Hitchcockian"" too far. ""Inspired by"" is one thing. ""Shameful ripoff"" is another. And then, suddenly, the last 10 minutes of this terrifying tale of delusion and isolation turns into ""The X-Files."" Disappointing.But it's still worth seeing, if you can handle the gloom.",Frailty
270,shades033,An excellent horror film on a par with Steven King's best,10,30 April 2002,"Movies with twist endings are a dime a dozen these days, but oncein awhile, a movie comes along that completely pulls the rug fromunder your feet and leaves you affected for hours after you've seenit.  The Usual Suspects was a movie that had a particularlyeffective twist ending.  So was last year's Memento. Horror movieshave long been known for creating twists when revealing theidentity of a killer, but rarely, has there been a horror movie thathas taken such an intellectual route to unveiling a story and thentrumping it with such an unexpected twist ending. As Frailty opens, the FBI is plagued by a series of serial killingsand disappearances by a criminal calling himself ""God's Hands"".They've reached an impasse in the case until a Fenton Meeks(played by Matthew McConaughey) comes to their door andreveals that his brother may be the killer.  He then proceeds torelay an incredible story about how their father dragged the boysinto a mission to destroy demons, conveniently disguised as localtownsfolk.Told in flashback, the story is set in a typical small town in theSouth, where Meeks' father, played by Bill Paxton, is a widowerraising his two sons on his own.  In the middle of the night, he tellshis sons that God has come to him in the form of an angel toenroll him as a soldier in God's army in a war against demonsliving on earth.  These demons look just like humans, except thatMeeks' father can see them by putting his hands on them. Hismission is to destroy them.  Fenton is a bit suspicious andskeptical, but his trusting younger brother, Adam, is enthralled andready to do whatever his father needs him to do.  Fenton'ssuspicions quickly turn to fear, as he witnesses his father destroyhis first demon with an axe and then bury the body in the rosegarden behind their house. His father's convictions in what he isdoing are so strong that he is able to sound convincing and sane,except that Fenton realizes he must stop his father. The conflictbetween the two leads to Fenton's lack of faith and a refusal tobelieve in God, as his father continuously pushes him toparticipate in the mission.Directed by Paxton, Frailty is a true horror movie of the highestmagnitude, and it's one of those intelligent character-driventhrillers that are far too rare. The tone and setting of the movie islike something that Stephen King might have written, while themovie itself is reminiscent of two of his better movie adaptations,the coming-of-age drama Stand by Me and Pet Sematary. Someaspects of Frailty also remind one of M. Night Shamalayan'sdreadful, Unbreakable. Although this tends to be equally as slow,Paxton takes a similar premise and does it in a way that managesto keep the viewer riveted to the screen. The most disturbingaspect of the movie is watching Paxton as the loving father whogets his children involved in his brutal crimes, and the situation iseven more tense when one realizes how witnessing such carnagecould affect these young minds. Setting the story in such a simplelocale as this Everytown, USA, makes the nature of the killingseven more harrowing. After spending the entire movie thinking youknow what will happen, the back-to-back plot twists at the end areevery bit as satisfying as those in The Usual Suspects andMemento.Considering that this is Paxton's first time as director, the excellentperformances by  the entire cast are even more impressive,particularly Matthew O'Leary, who plays the young Fenton Meeks. O'Leary's performance makes him one of those child actors thatshould be kept an eye upon. Jeremy Sumpter plays his optimisticbrother, Adam, in a way that brings a nice counterpoint to thebrothers' relationship with their father.  Without question, Paxton isevery bit as good in this as he was in A Simple Plan, playing thefather with a creepy smile of confidence and an air of politenessthat makes his cause seem just. By comparison, MatthewMcConaughey's role is fairly minor, as he only appears in theframing sequences and acts as narrator for the flashback scenes. When he is in front of the camera, he does a nice job looking andacting as haggard as one who might after experiencing some ofthe things he did as a teenager.The script by first-time screenwriter, Brian Hanley, is sharp and thestorytelling is coherent and easy to follow, which can be rare in thissort of movie. Some of the twist movies that Frailty drawscomparisons to have left the viewer thinking, ""huh?"", due to theoverly complex storytelling. Even though Frailty sometimes uses aflashback within the main flashback, it still manages to keepthings comparatively simple and cohesive.The movie doesn't actually show much of the inherent violence orgore, making  it even more disturbing as the mind fills in theblanks with the graphic detail, and the sound effects add further tothe effect. The background music works well to help build thetension, and the lighting is used to create a mood more effectivelythan any other recent movie I've seen. From the light pouringthrough the slats in a shed to the light emblazoning the police cargrill onto McConaughey's face, the lighting plays the largest part inmaking this movie visually stunning, much like Alan Parker's AngelHeart.Frailty is easily one of the best horror movies I've seen in a longtime, almost like that Stephen King movie that no one has yet beenable to make. Paxton should be commended on such a finedirectorial debut and for bringing together such a fine group ofactors.",Frailty
271,mshires,"Bill Paxton's feature directorial debut is stunning, disturbing, mesmerizing..",8,16 April 2002,"Bill Paxton's first feature as director is incredible to watch and disturbing to ponder.  Paxton's character, a single father listed simply in the credits as ""Dad"",  receives a vision from God that he must destroy demons in our society that appear to be human.  So he involves his children in the act of serial  murder.  His two children played by Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter offer rich, believable performances that are as good as anything you'll see from veteran actors, especially given the nature of the material.Paxton delivers a steady, methodical pace that involves us so deeply in the dilemma of his two boys who are forced to participate in these gruesome acts that the tension becomes unbearable.

272,joeshannongabe,"disturbing and creepy, but oh, what an ending!",9,8 January 2003,"I had many reservations about watching this film. I knew the reviews were good and friends whose movie tastes I respect had excitedly recommended it to me. So I was fairly sure I would like it. But the idea of watching a father destroy his family was unsettling to me. I don't know why I felt this way. I have watched many films with morally ambiguous or downright despicable characters and enjoyed them. I'm no prude, thats for sure. But I have a three year old son and so the thought of a father twisting his boys' minds is of course upsetting. So I avoided this film until last night when there was absolutely nothing else I was interested in seeing at my local Blockbuster (the summer movie crap is currently being released). As I watched this movie, I was filled with a sense of heartbreak and dread as the father began what I thought was his decent into madness. Seeing the young son seek his fathers approval through these killings was truly and profoundly sad. I am no fan of fundamentalists and seeing this man rant about ""visions"" and ""angels"" only confirmed all my worst preconceived notions about these beliefs. Thats why I was so surprised and intrigued at the inverted, Old Testament style ending. Because of my own beliefs, I know that people who claim to hear God and see angels are psychotic, delusional or lying. But this film reminded me that in the movies, anything is possible. Even dogma that I discarded long ago.",Frailty

But the only bad thing is that I already knew how it will end, who is he and what will he do with him. I already knew 90 % of the movie after the first 20 minutes. Now, I read some of the other reviews and they all gave this movie good or excellent rating. But I just have to be real and say, this movie, if you really watch it, after 20 minutes you will already know it's ending.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, it pretty much hit the point, nice story packed with good acting. It deals with that are quite ""popular"" in this time.To summarize, I gave it 5/10. Decent movie. I just wished that I slept first 20 minutes...

They all act brilliantly though, and the way the plot is pulled together at the end is part of what makes it so good.I recommend this film to EVERYBODY!!Mathew Mccon. Is really good and this is the best role that I have seen him in. Bill Paxman although accomplished at directing this is still not on my list of favourite actors.

277,jameslamont,A very disturbing movie,9,31 August 2004,"This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders. The storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in Texas, US who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of bad people.Bill Paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged Father who is known as the Hand of God Killer while Matthew McConaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe).I cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie.The directors have filmed this movie very well, and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. The acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people.Whilst the concept of this film is very dark, the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. This really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different.8/10",Frailty

The reviews I had heard were OK . As a result I was expecting an average thriller at most .However because of Paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching , especially if you are a horror film fanatic.The film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits . The films strongest point is the storyline which I have to say is highly original and is like I have ever seen before. Well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it.",Frailty

I think what makes people rate it so high was the plot twist factor (which was kind of obvious from the beginning, but still not bad), but other than that the acting was mostly stale. The father character (Bill Paxton) was far from convincing, and unfortunately, the flashbacks consisting of him and the kids make up a big portion of the movie. I think it could turn out to be a much better movie with better directing and acting. Overall, the movie felt like a random X File episode to me.",Frailty
280,servoskull,A much appreciated break from the norm.,8,22 September 2008,"Ever since Scream became a surprise box office hit in 1996, Hollywood has literally saturated itself with unimaginative, predictable teen horror flicks so when a film like The Blair Witch Project or Frailty comes along its like a breath of fresh air.Frailty's story centres around Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey), a man who approaches the FBI with concern that his brother Adam might just be ""God's Hands"", a serial killer the bureau has been hunting. Using flashbacks to show Meeks' childhood, its revealed his father (Bill Paxton) believes he was chosen by God one day to destroy demons that inhabit human bodies. Because of this and the events that follow, Fenton believed his dad evil, while Adam regarded him a hero.The plot is somewhat convoluted as the father claims to receive instruction from the divine to seek out and terminate 'demons'. Are they actual supernatural demons or real people who thought they'd got away with a heinous crime in the past? Or maybe the father is just deranged with murderous intentions? Intriguing twists and intense build-ups tantalise viewers into staying with this film to the end.The standard of acting is surprisingly high throughout. Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter convincingly play the brothers in their youth alongside an excellent performance from Paxton. Frailty provides Paxton with his directorial debut too and his talent shows. There's very little gore in this film but it is very creepy nonetheless.So, while I can appreciate the film won't appeal to everyone's taste, I would recommend you at least give Frailty a try. It's certainly a refreshing break from the usual no-brainer horror thriller and may just surprise you. I'd be very surprised if you weren't talking about it afterwards.",Frailty

What I did know was that Bill Paxton directed it and also had the lead role in it.If you are expecting a real slasher, that's not what you'll get. There's actually not much gore in this film. It's really a very good thriller that gets under your skin. I guess Paxton was influenced by 'A Simple Plan' by Sam Raimi in which he also starred.The acting is very good and believable. Paxton, Powers Boothe, the 2 kids and even McConaughey are in top form. For a guy who is directing his first movie, Paxton, I must say, does it almost perfectly. The sound and music only add to the movie.Then there's the ending. I've read that many people all saw the twists coming.

284,evildead167,Frailty (**** out of 5),7,7 July 2002,"`Only Demons should fear me.  You're not a Demon, are you?'`Frailty' joins the ranks of good psychological, character-driven horror films like `Session 9', `Ginger Snaps' and `The Others', that have managed to sneak their way past the Hollywood crap in the last few years.  It's about time for good fear-films to come out, after far too long of a time of mediocre Scream rip-offs and `modern' slasher flicks. A man (Mathew McConaughey) comes to an FBI official, claiming information about a string of `God's Hand' murders.  To him, the man then reveals a story of his childhood leading to the present day killings.Young brothers, Fenton and Adam Meiks live in relative normalcy, raised in a small town by their kindly father (Paxton), their mother long dead.  This peaceful life is shattered, however, when one night dear old dad has a divine `vision', God placing him and his family on a mission to `destroy demons'.  The only thing is, these `demons' walk on Earth in human form. The boys hope this was just a bad dream (maybe Dad just had too much to drink before going to bed), but soon he receives more of these messages, giving him a list of names of those that must be `destroyed' and the weapons to do it by.  Fenton is torn between his devotion to his father and brother and his repulsion to what he believes is murder. Long-time character actor, Bill Paxton (`Apollo 13', `Near Dark', `A Simple Plan') directs his first film and shows skills he picked-up from working with the likes of Sam Raimi and James Cameron.  `Frailty' is very bleak and atmospheric.  The killings are not so gruesome as shocking. This makes them scarier. Acting-wise, the movie is also quite good.  Mathew McConaughey is actually creepy.  His cold, almost monotone delivery hides a human being truly disturbed by the events of his early life.  Bill Paxton is great as the father.  He does a complex character; devoted to his kids but also lashed into what he believes is his duty to God.  There is no `Jason' mentality here; he kills because he feels it is what he must do.  Even the child-actors are good. `Frailty' does move at too slow of a pace for some people and the second half is outdone by the first.  Self-titled `gore-hounds' might be disappointed at the lack of gratuitous bloodshed.  Religious people might also be insulted by the movie's take on God. Granted, `Frailty' is not for everyone, but if you're interested in seeing an intelligent, disturbing horror/suspense film, see this.",Frailty
285,Helldorado13,Mothman?,10,19 October 2002,"Now having seen this and the Mothman movies, I cannot see how anyone could compare the two and keep a straight face. This is a wonderfully twisted movie about good-evil-and the perception of both. The plot twists in all the right places and in general gives the creeps. It's a low budget film and so what! Not everything we see should have a $850,000,000 budget. This movie manages to create a small town creepy feel that stays with it. I've seen this movie several times now and it still gives me the heebie-jebbies. Well worth watching if you're into spiritual spookiness.

Whose slaughter?A lot is left to the observer's imagination in this methodical and morbid portrait of humanity. However this story is interpreted, the final question is: How can human beings think and behave this way? What are we? What made us this way?I found this to be a well made budget film with very fine acting and simple, adequate directing. The music was good and fit the plot. The visuals were all well captured as well as the sound. What's left wanting, quite deliberately, is what exactly is going on in the plot of the story? There are enough 'clues' left around, nicely discussed in other reviews here, to leave the viewer wondering. Who's fooling who? Was the story told about this family fabricated? Seeing as so many clues back up the base story told by the narrator, is this person actually doing god's work? Is this story actually saying there are demons on Earth as well as demon slayers? This isn't another episode of the CW program 'Supernatural'. This is outright ambiguous and horrifying to consider.From my own point of view, this is a story about how brutally insane we humans can be in our religious concepts of what is 'absolutely true'. We can justify almost anything, no matter how wrong. We elected a psychopath to the US presidency, with all the predictable outcomes, we can be so blind. 'Charismatic', 'evangelical' 'Christians' vehemently supported and defended this demonic person as 'sent by god'. So why not have fellow humans believe in demon mythology, go all rapturous with visions when they touch someone they perceive to be a 'demon'? We are so frail in our minds. The Meik shall inherit the Earth? We are all just meat in Meat, Texas and our sheriff is a prolific serial killer, our protector and defender? I'm left considering this to be a deeply cynical film about mankind's worst of enemies, its greatest frailty, our own deceptive truth conjuring minds. Noise hides our frail identities from our fellow humans.",Frailty
288,poldemol,"Bill Paxton made a movie, better than any of which he ever starred in, nice, no?",10,30 October 2005,"It's a movie where your reaction to it, will tell a lot about who you are. Contains some spoilers, because it's pretty impossible to give a good review without spoilers of this film. Straightforwardly it's a very immoral movie. Subversive and evil probably too. One of the very few movies I've seen, that I wouldn't let just anyone see. Not suitable for the very influential who are not aware of it (and definitely not for those who at the same time have deep fundamentalist religious feelings, could be inspirational for them.). And you probably won't like it when you feel strongly about religion(be it pro or contra) either. If your reaction to this is, 'hey this is fantastic, finally a movie where I can identify 100% with the main character', than you are probably a psychopath, although according to the movie you are a hero, don't you just love stuff like that? This movie doesn't go for the easy cop-outs. It would have, if it just had one twist, the first one, namely that the good guy turns out to be the bad, something you probably will see coming in viewing the movie. Than it would have been just a solid dark thriller, with good tension, acting,...and a nice twist at the end. But immediately, there is a second twist, which turns the bad guy into a good guy again! Superb I'd say, we have a guy, who murders people, out of religious inspiration, with an axe, even his nice little brother, and he's protected by god, he's an angel killing demons, LITERALLY! A young boy kills his own father, for all the right reasons, he had no choice, the father was mad, the father would probably have killed him or others if he tried something else, and it turns out, that the father was actually a hero! Brilliant! The story is just so extremely well written, self-fulfilling prophecy's incorporated into the story line and all I just loved it, but that's just me, I don't feel too strongly about religion, in either direction, I'm a pretty neutral person, so if you don't fit into the left or right wing stereotypes(and who really does?), than you should definitely see this movie, which works on every level it wants to. Cause besides its subversive messages, it also has moments of poetry(the visions), compassion, emotion, madness, very high tension, and serialkiller-murdermystery. Absolutely fantastic. It's not necessary to say the writer Brent Hanley and director Bill Paxton, deserve much praise, as do the actors(definitely also the young ones), and everyone else involved with anything of this movie really. It combines the best elements of things like The Silence of the Lambs, a Clockwork Orange and the Usual Suspects, and it does that, seemingly without effort, brilliant I'd say.",Frailty

I love the thriller genre and this was good, eerie, but not too gory....the ending was a kick as well.... As far as everyone's arguments on the board over demons and angels, well people like controversy and I am sure that is was Mr. Paxton was betting on....I know some people found the movie offensive...being a person of faith, I do find the God's Avengers 'idea' far-fetched (are they superheros? Where are their costumes? They should at least get OTIS tattoos.) BUT that does not mean I did not enjoy the movie immensely...for goodness sake I was watching Scifi channel, I know what to expect...;-).....Anyhow, I do think the dad was a little off his noodle that night when he had the dream but hey, who am I to say? (The angel in his vision under the car was a little weird but once again, who knows what angels look like or what kind of budget they had for special effects!) I think if he didn't really see angels or get a list from God, then his general insanity and abuse of his poor two boys (off in the middle of nowhere) led them to be freaky killers too.....The best part about the entire movie is that you don't know the truth....are they 'righteous' killers led by God? Or are they nut bars having unfounded visions when they touch people? (who's to say those visions are real anyhow?

Seriously, most people WANT to believe that Dad Meiks is just straight up crazy..

What makes this movie even more interesting is that it sells the alternative scenario that Dad Meiks was genuinely dealing deadly justice to people/demons on behalf of God... Whoa, were Dad Meiks and Adam genuinely receiving clear instructions to kill demons from a Higher Power? The movie was scary enough when you simply think the Dad Meiks was a nutty serial killer that was killing people and turning his kids insane... There were serious cringe-worthy moments. BUT that narrative is turned on its heels when it is seemingly revealed that Dad Meiks, and later Adam, were actually duly designated by higher spiritual authority to be ""Hatchet Men."" THEN we learn that Fenton was supposedly a Demon who became a serial killer? Wow this movie really gets you thinking about morality, justice, spiritual matters, and pre-destination (Fenton was just a kid and Dad Meiks supposedly knew he was a demon -- But he had not even done anything wrong)...

He describes growing up in a small Texas town with his father and brother and watching his home life transform into a paranoid religious cult, as his father becomes gripped by religious hallucinations instructing him to kill people. I thought it was an average movie borrowing from the thriller/horror formulas and outstanding classics like ""Sleepers"" and ""Usual Suspects"". There is such a mix of good and bad in the film, but mostly I felt irritated while watching it.Pros: Could be an interesting interrogation of the construction of white masculinity cast against black absence (for the Bhabha-reading postmodern viewer). Disturbing inclusion of child abuse, which makes this film seem bolder and more important than others in the genre. Retrospective narration & voice-overs. No gore. Clever manipulation of what is really happening. I wasn't entirely sure who was good and who was the victim throughout the movie.Cons: Bad overacting at times. The pacing seems pretty slow for over an hour. Vapid dialog that requires voice-over narration to compensate. A plot twist sort of along the lines of the plot twist in ""Usual Suspects"", except it was more fun when I saw it in that movie ten years ago. No gore. Criminality that is inconsistent with DSM-IV. Costuming? What's that? Considering that most of the story-telling should be happening in the 70's, why does everyone looked like they got their clothes in 1995?",Frailty

This film is a phenominal display of how powerful the imagination is, both the audience's and character's.  The violence is off-screen for the most part, and never, ever gratuitous.  The real terror in this movie doesn't revolve around boogeymen jumping out of bushes, but by the growing madness and brainwashing of all the characters involved.  And for that, Director Bill Paxton and Screenwriter Brent Henley should be given medals.Bill Paxton plays Dad with an incredible amount of realism, understanding and honesty.  The children were exceptional, as was Matthew McConaughey, acting in ways he hasn't yet, giving us a thrilling and exciting performance.The photography, by Bill Butler (Jaws) was also beautiful, and subtly moves the story along, making suggestions about certain characters along the way, which is a rarity in films of late, but most certainly appreciated here.While the film does have some third act flaws (but what movie DOESN'T these days), it hardly detracts from a suspenseful thriller/whodunnit that lets it characters grow and doesn't 'jump scare' you.

Adam is now dead from apparent suicide and now Fenton is free to tell the whole tale about his religiously insane father and brother and the ""Demons"" that they have destroyed all over Texas for the last 22 years.
1979The story runs that ""Dad"" Meiks is a single parent living alone with his 2 sons. One night, he claims that God gave him the message that he must become ""God's Hands"" on earth and destroy ""Demons"" which inhabit human form. He and his sons are chosen to dispose of the evil doers and bury them in an ample sized orchard with backs onto their land. Adam is happy to help, Fenton wants the ""destruction"" to stop at all costs.
Most films which run in a mainly flashback scenario, dart back and forth. It's pleasing that FRAILTY was allowed to run it's course and Bill Paxton didn't feel the need to rush the plot to the point where  the movie seems a complete blur.The plot twists are cleverly introduced where for a moment, it's difficult to see where the film is going and then ""CLICK"", suddenly it's all in place and makes perfect sense.The two boys are fantastic in their roles and it's also nice to see Paxton in a role that doesn't make him an arsehole or a jock.
This film has extremely religious overtones yet is not a conversion movie. It pays homage to the wrath of the Old Testament and gives a great sense of justice at the end in the way that the wrong doers are dead and the sense of FRAILTY that you feel when you have sympathised for 99% of the film, with the wrong character.FRAILTY deserves a lot more credit than it has received globally, yet the box office receipts tell a different story.20 years from now, I imagine 2 friends talking in a bar about a film they watched last night about a religious father killing demons in his shed.... His friend will respond with ""Is that the one where the brother was right all along?""....Anyone who watches this film will remember it in the way that SE7EN will be remembered for the ""head in the box"" ending....But you'll have to watch it to see what I mean.10 out of 10",Frailty

I screamed out loud in one part.  Bill Paxton was amazing.  He had me believing there really might be demons.

307,pirate727,Great Job Bill Paxton!,10,30 September 2002,"Man, some of you people have got to chill.  This movie was artistic genius. Instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction?  A story. Entertainment, for God's sake (no pun intended).  It seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics--and they're not doing to well. I'm so impressed by the movie and Bill Paxton's job at directing, that I'm going to contact him personally to tell him. Ya know, if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line, you might just enjoy the film.  Me and all of my friends did!",Frailty
308,droorogers,Astounding,9,9 February 2007,"I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day, after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star, I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan.I was not disappointed. The acting was superb, especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot.One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them coming. The final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though I've re-watched the film so many times.A true gem.",Frailty
309,sehenley,A hum-dinger of a movie!,9,3 February 2003,"I just rented this and was incredibly shocked at how good it was!  Bill Paxton's directorial debut is phenomenal, and even better is his acting in this film.  In another actor's hands, the character of ""Dad"" would have been a showing, scenery-chewing role; but Paxton chooses to play the role with ultra-quiet understatement.  His ""Dad"" truly loves his children and believes he is doing the right thing by them and by God - which makes his character all the more frightening and intriguing.  I truly wish this film had been marketed better; it deserves to have been a smash hit, and it's a shame that it wasn't.  Paxton most definitely deserves Oscar nods for his acting and directing, which he most certainly won't get.The only problem that I would say exists with this film is the casting of Powers Boothe.  He's an actor who always come across as sinister, and it causes the ""revelations"" about his character at the end of the film to be not all that shocking.  Except for that, the film is great.  I can't wait to see what Bill Paxton chooses to do for his sophomore directing effort.",Frailty
310,redbudnate,Bill Paxton strikes again.,4,29 October 2002,"First, I tend to really dislike Bill Paxton. I think he and Bill Pullman have a certain stiffness quality on screen that only corpses can truly reproduce. In my opinion he should wait until Weird Science 2003 is made so he can make his triumphant return as Chet.With that said, I gave this a try because it looked interesting. Turns out I was wrong. A pretty good performance by McConaughey is wasted in an extremely poorly told story. I found myself not sure whether to be scared or laugh at some of the ""tense scenes"" in the film. There are a couple of shots that are supposed to be frightening that may make you actually laugh out loud. My favorite was when he lays his hands on the victims. It looks like a bad TV evangelist making a healing.The movie doesn't develop the religious fanaticism of Paxton, and from then on his visions and claims come off as cheesy. If you're going to go for the supernatural you'd better take some time to make the audience believe. By the time the plot gets interesting at the end, you've probably ceased to care.",Frailty

This movie covers a man who is chosen by God to destroy demons.I know this may sound crazy and this is also the whole grip of the film writer sustains suspense till the end that whether this man is a psycho or is he real. Bill Paxton did a great job in this movie in both acting and directing. Mathew McConaughey proves himself once again a great actor. I am not saying this because of my he is my favorite but he acted really great through out the movie.      It's a perfect thriller and suspense movie that makes it a little horror too. I give this movie 9 points out of 10.,Frailty
313,cheapdate,Disappointment thanks to 'bookends',1,14 October 2003,"A working-class single father (Bill Paxton) afflicted with religious visions instructs his two young sons (the excellent Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter) in how to kill people--or as he sees them, demons--in his blind obedience to God. But is dear old dad obeying God's will, the devil's, or his own? Is he a child abuser and a nut, or a good man and a loving father? If God asked you to kill, would you, and should you?These are the soul-searching questions ""Frailty"" asks in its kernel story. Unfortunately, the 'bookends' device that the movie uses, with one of the now grown-up sons as narrator (Matthew McConaughey), manages to do a fine hatchet-job of its own by unambiguously answering these questions for us. (I just hate when movies don't trust their audiences to make up their own minds, don't you?)More's the pity because the main story in ""Frailty"" is far more GENUINELY disturbing than the ridiculous, twist-a-minute mess that is the bookends.
Then again, perhaps the most disturbing thing about this movie is that there will be viewers who agree with its message (and its messengers)...! Creepy.",Frailty
314,cruzincat,Too many people didn't get the ultimate twist/plot element...,10,26 April 2011,"I only recently saw this film on DirecTV for the first time. I saw it from the middle to the end, the first time around, thought it was interesting and DVR'd it so I could watch it from the beginning. I have since watched it several times. I do not have the DVD so I have not had the opportunity to view any of the commentaries. If this has been laid out there, I am sorry to waste your time here.I mentioned the movie to a coworker who beamed when I mentioned its name. He had been at a Blockbuster, going out of business and picked up the DVD for $1, not knowing what it was. He said he has watched it at least twenty times, because he shows it to everybody who comes over! I came here to see what others had to say about the movie. I am shocked by how many people criticize the movie for the confusing storyline while Matthew M.'s character lays it out for Doyle.There were indeed a lot of twists in this movie, most importantly the one where you think the family is just plain crazy and you find out that they indeed had a revelation from God and they were actually destroying demons. Obviously non-believers will have trouble with that aspect. (it's only a movie - it doesn't have to be true) Most of the negative comments on this film seem to arise from supposed holes in the plot and/or elements of the plot that do not make sense. Well, I say that if you watch it one more time with the following thought, that the surviving son had one purpose for telling the story as he did.***** He wanted to get Doyle into the Rose Garden.***** Everything he said, whether it made any sense at the time or even later, was designed with that purpose in mind. Even the supposed assistance of his wife makes sense now, when you think about that. Even I didn't realize that premise the first couple times I watched it, so I can't criticize others for not getting it either.It should all make sense to everyone now.",Frailty
315,netgrazer,Not for the shallow minded or delusional *SPOILERS*,9,1 March 2004,"*SPOILERS*The ending's pretty spectacular, actually... After Adam slays his latest demon, we see FBI agents trying to figure out who that guy was visiting agent Doyle the other night. Agent #1 can't exactly remember his face, saying it's all a blur. The surveillance tape seems mysteriously damaged (the VHS noise exactly masks his face), so they follow the only lead they have and head for the village Doyle had checked out the info from earlier on in the movie. Agent #1 shows up at the sherriff's office, the lady that answered earlier inquiries by phone is there, and lo and behold, the sherriff is none other than Adam himself. The FBI agent has a Hitchcock type zoom effect happening to him and does not recognize him at all. He informs Adam about his 'brother', and Adam assures them he'll help any way he can. They shake hands, whereupon Adam tells the other he's a good man. No flashes of demonic nastiness. The agent leaves, confused. The girl walks up to him, real happy to hear that ""god's will has been served"" or something. (She's obviously a 'follower'.) The end.Now, if you ask me, that whole last part, from the plot twist/brother perspective swap up to the end, is us looking at the whole story from Adam's point of view, who happens to be a delusional maniac, explaining Doyle's 'confession', the face blur, tape screw up and final handshake (which doesn't actually do anything except build upon the other 3 'evidences').Otherwise, the director would be suggesting that as long as you're 'chosen', you're a superhero who can do anything he wants to combat whatever evil you are 'shown'. We're tempted to consider this possibility because Hollywood directors almost ALWAYS take the stinger out at the end, making sure you know big ol' mister movieguy was just kidding.It's the total absence of this referential correction that makes for a truly freaky movie.I read in someone else's review they renamed it 'the devil's hand' in Brazil. They just had to put it in perspective for the feeble minded... shame though, it's the lack of moral comment that I like about it. But I'm not delusional, most of the time.Yet another reviewer pointed out that it's conveniently coincidental that a demon has been put on his case. That might just be the only clue to a moral comment in the entire 'Adam's view' part of the story. Because it's just too coincidental, and I have to conclude that outside of Adam's version of the story, in 'reality', he just wanted to wrap the whole thing up... His double identity as his long dead brother, the cellar filled with corpses, and most of all that annoying FBI agent that has devoted himself to his case. For Adam, the best way to get that man where he wanted to bury him, was to tell the side of the story Adam thinks Doyle will sympathize with.I realize there may be people thinking that Adam only recently killed his brother, and/or that his older brother was another demon slaying loony, responsible for the corpses in the cellar. Or even, that Doyle was 'sent' to Adam, making the whole story commentless again. Just writing this makes me reconsider at least the first two options.My own view just seems to add up more than the others, for me. Which could be unhealthy if I was delusional, right?Needless to say i rate this baby a 9...",Frailty

318,jeremyplewis,Two viewings but still see it as worst film I ever mistakenly bought,4,28 September 2009,"The film is marketed as a tale of a police investigation into what appear to be the crimes of a serial murderer. The kind of thing that might sit well in the company of Se7en, Silence Of The Lambs, Along Came A Spider etc. For a good part of the film that is what appears to be taking place. As the end approaches it becomes clear that its not going to be resolved the way you'd like it to be, the way the story in your head is developing. You are forced at the end of the movie to either go with the ludicrous premise of the writer or realise that you have just wasted 96 minutes of your life. I did feel cheated. The makers of the film should have been upfront about the supernatural, mumbo-jumbo nature of the plot and then I would not have mistakenly bought it, watched it and mistakenly given it a second chance from sheer disbelief that the film I had seen could really be as bad as it seemed.",Frailty
319,AlixSinnamon,All Around Excellent,10,9 March 2017,"This film had wins and nominations, but it is still underrated and deserves to be among the classics with Silence of the Lambs and The Exorcist. Every moment is masterfully crafted and comes together at the end with a very Stephen King flavor. The entire premise is very simple, but that is what helps the film be so intense. It never wavers; it builds upon itself gloriously. The casting of the film's two children was impeccable, and Paxton's direction of them must have been perfect. The viewer really feels every moment of pure dread and anguish the children felt at the hands of their father, who commits atrocities in front of them and makes them help him. As far as special effects, it was a brilliant choice to keep it simple with sprays of blood on clothing as opposed to tossing buckets onto the actors. Even though a viewer never actually sees any weapon make contact, it still feels like they do. The background score is very simple yet effective- the standard powerful strings building as tension rises. To reveal every bit of the-masterfully written- plot, one has to watch even the very last second, and looking away is something to be regretted.",Frailty
320,vk-11,See it,8,6 July 2006,"Well this movie is that good that it doesn't need a lot of words, its very watchable and enjoyable. Like those two little boys who acted their little hearts out. Of course both the script and Bill Paxton as a director work very well. The story is dark and disturbing and has a great twist at the end. Of course this unexpected twist doesn't make an enjoyable second sighting but that is as expected. What this movie lacks with its great atmosphere is more on screen violence. Most of the violence is off screen except for the very end. Since they already slapped the rating on the film, it couldn't have hurt to put more gore in it. I wonder why they didn't. Well anyway, this film is a great, not so gory but disturbing, experience. It works well with substandard film-making formulas and makes it an enjoyable experience.

I don't know if everything my companions and I found humorous was intentional, but I have no doubt that the very last scene was played for laughs. Even the final twist felt a little like ""Ha! The jokes on you"" to me.  The photography, casting, and especially the score were excellent.  I could see Something coming in most of the twists, but I wasn't sure what it would be.

332,G8RMAN,"Great plot, COULD have been Oscar worthy",7,24 October 2002,"I'll agree with what many have said here - Frailty has a wonderful, creepy and unique plot line, which instantly gains my respect. Similar to ""A Simple Plan,"" ""Frailty"" throws several normal-seeming characters into a twisted situation that is anything but normal. However, it does offer a unique perspective on a serial killer, his motivations, and the life forced on those around him.I thought Matthew M. and the actor playing young Fenton Meeks do an excellent job - they are just very good actors for the roles, very convincing. I think Bill Paxton's acting is alright, but some of the dialogue and direction are TOO pat, a little staged-feeling. I know that there's a creepy/funny tone he's going for in some scenes, but it played like something out of a 50's science reel, just a little too unbelievable. And the actor playing the young Adam Meeks, I thought, wasnot very good at all. Typical barely sufficient child actor, it was clear he was acting though the whole film, none of his lines were convincing: forced laughs, overplayed gestures, just not too good. I'm not a big fan of mediocre child actors, and this one was less than mediocre, in my humble opinion.This, however, should not be enough to make you avoid this film. While it does move at a somewhat stately pace than slam-bang action, it is worth every minute of screentime, satisfying from beginning to end.",Frailty

I am probably one of the very few which didn't like FRAILTY, but I must honestly tell you, I nearly fell asleep. After one hour I wanted to leave, because I was very bored (I didn't do it, as I never do that. So here are the reasons why I disliked FRAILTY: (don't go on reading, if you didn't see it)When you first see the little boys, it's obvious who is who. But then they want to make us believe it's the contrary. Some people seemed to be fooled by that. From the moment on the murders happen it is obvious who is who.What I absolutely dislike in movies are ""the not so clever things which they have to do so that the movie can go on"": or does anybody think that a real FBI agent would go alone with somebody who confesses a murder (even if he says it wasn't him) without back up in a dark rainy night. I don't think so. That's the typical thing that only happens in movies.I also feel bad for Powers Booth: in this kind of movies he HAS to play a bad guy. When you know that he is in the movie you know that he will do something bad or that he will be the murder.And than the twist! What twist? I think that until then everybody should know what it is all about.Some critics compare it to Memento which I have not seen yet and I expect a lot from it, as it is in front of Usual Suspects (my all time favorite thriller). But now I am afraid to go see it.Some other people say you should see it without having seen the trailer. That is a very good idea, I always do it. I try not to know anything about the movie except which are the actors and the director (it's very difficult). You will get a different opinion, if you go to the movies without preconceived ideas or expectations(of your critics and of your friends). You will also take the risk to see very bad movies. Your surprise will be big, if you read the critics afterwards, like my surprise here that so many people liked FRAILTY.So this is my opinion.

The movie starts out with the usual setting - a questionable stranger has information about the local unsolved serial killings.  But this is where the Hollywood formula is morphed into something fresh and new.  The plot is slowly revealed via flash backs to the stranger's childhood.  The lines of mental illness and religious fanaticism are blurred.  The shocks come as expected, but they are very unsettling. This is not a slasher flick.  The violence is off camera and made all the more visceral by your imagination. I thought this was Bill Paxton's directorial debut until I checked his posted filmography.  I predict this to be a sleeper hit along the lines of The Gift.  The same sensibilities apply. Instead of a frightened mother, you have the lovable father who been assigned the duty of being `God's hands'.  A must see for all horror/thriller fans.",Frailty

340,markeetos,An excellent directorial debut!!,10,24 September 2002,"I really didn't know anything about this movie coming in other than that it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, but I was quite impressed.
The movie is about a single-father family that is ""called by God"" to destroy demons, yet throughout most of the movie, it just comes across as serial murder. Bill Paxton plays Dad, as the credits dictate, and does a great job. He's loves his boys very much and would do anything for them, but also commands their respect and obedience. Matthew O'Leary does a great job as Fenton Meeks, driving the movie along with his doubt and consequential actions. Matthew McConaughey plays grownup Fenton, narrating the story with a chilling seriousness, and veteran Powers Boothe plays the FBI agent in charge of the God's Hands killer case who listens to McConaughey's story and investigates.This movie really hit home with me in the sense that growing up, my mother was always telling me that God has this plan and I have to obey him no matter what. In a similar, albeit more violent way, Paxton forces his children to witness and eventually participate in the ""destruction"" of demons, people that were ""given"" to him by an angel. The movie and its characters delves deeper and darker as the movie progresses and the conflicts get more intense as a child must decide whether to obey his father even when he doubts him with all his heart, or do the right thing. The movie takes an interesting twist midway through (No spoilers, I promise), at which point I really wasn't sure what was going on. I thought I had the movie figured out until the very last line destroyed that theory and birthed another.It took some discussion with my friend afterwards to really pinpoint what happened, but it's not difficult to figure out with a little creative thought. This is a great movie to watch by yourself or with your girlfriend, but you have to pay attention to everything that's said or you might miss a key point.This movie is definitely watchable over and over, as new theories can materialize each time. A lot of fun. Worth a 9 at the least!",Frailty

342,skebo,I was shocked by how good this was,8,21 July 2005,"Frailty starts out somewhat slow but builds nicely to what I would call a surprise ending. Frailty works on so many levels but what I found made it great was the child actors and Bill Paxton's use of tension to create suspense. Powers Boothe and MM both give great performances in what could almost be called bit parts, however Paxton puts both of them to good use. The entire film relies on drama and suspense with very little action. This movie really has you ask yourself a lot of questions about faith and what you would do in a similar situation. It almost seems far-fetched at times but the script comes back to fix any earlier lapses. This movie really is a hidden gem and one that I wish would have pushed Paxton into direction because he really showed his ability to be a filmmaker.",Frailty

Up & coming stars like Matt O' Leary and Jeremy Sumpter who show a real promising future in film. Down to all season pro's like Powers Boothe. This film had me on the edge of my seat even after the final credits rolled.

346,ruadhainwolf,Good acting and fine directing but predictable.,5,20 April 2002,"Overall I found this movie to be fairly entertaining, even if it was very predictable.  I have to say the actors who portrayed the children in the movie did an outstanding job.  Likewise the performances of Paxton and Boothe were commendable.  The directing choices were really pretty good. My main problems stem from the story line and writing.  I found this movie to be *very* predicable.  There were a number of points in the movie that I found amusing that I was certain weren't supposed to be funny.  It also seemed to suffer from identity crisis.  Was it a horror movie?  Not terribly frightening.  A mystery?  Nah.  Suspense thriller?  Closer, there were tense moments waiting for the inevitable axe to fall.  (Sorry, I couldn't help it.)  As a character study it works and maybe that's the problem.  If it is a study of what moves a person to become a serial killer, or how early childhood traumas will twist a kid, well, it definitely did that.  Don't get me wrong, a movie that defies categoration can be astonishing, just not when the audience is scratching it's collective head, wondering ""what is this?"" As a friend quipped during the movie, either it's a horror film and really bad or a black comedy and really good.  Hmmmmm.I suppose what really disappointed me the most was that the acting was so good and the photography and direction was such that I really *wanted* it to catch me offguard.  I wanted to be wrong about what was going to come next. Regardless of my mediocre rating (5) I would go see another Paxton project, and I look forward to seeing more of those kids.Well, that's my two cents. Enjoy, Tom",Frailty

And, by the advertisements I did see, it didn't seem to me to be the most interesting movie out there right now.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie really captivates human nature and all its unpleasantries.  The acting was superb.  Matthew McConaughey portrayed his emotionally and spiritually disturbed character so well and Bill Paxton fit the role of his crazy father like a glove.  The movie itself is not entirely scary in the sense that things pop out at you or ghosts are flying around. It's scary because this could really happen.  Those are the scariest movies of all.  Overall, I liked the movie but there were some scenes in it that were a little goofy and far-fetched.

351,akeelah02,Stop the trend of switcheroo endings,2,14 April 2002,"THE SIXTH SENSE was a terrific film.  But it started a terrible trend. Namely, the compulsion to ""trick"" the audience with a twist ending that redefines everything you've seen in the story up to that point.  The problem with these switcheroo endings is they often force the characters in the main plot to seem like they're behaving illogically.  However, once we see what the TRUTH behind the tale is, we can then go back and see the justification for the characters' bizarre behavior.  The problem is, you can't enjoy the main story while it's happening because it doesn't make sense (I had this problem with THE OTHERS but most people didn't).  In FRAILTY, the compulsion to ""fake out"" the audience is taken to such an extreme that film-makers put all their eggs in the ""climax"" basket -- and forget about telling a main story that works.  We're therefore forced to endure a serious of absolutely unbelievable plot developments and character decisions.  Two kids basically go along with their father on a killing spree.  He tells them he's been told by an angel to kill ""demons"" posing as real people, and that this is ""God's work.""  The younger kid accepts this explanation -- the older kid takes issue with it.  But he doesn't freak out, run away, have a tantrum, become traumatized, tell somebody -- all the stuff a kid would actually do if he saw his daddy axe-murder somebody.  The reason for his (and his brothers's) abnormal behavior is ultimately explained by the switcheroo ending -- an ending you can predict in the first act.  But then the entire film just becomes a prologue to the final ""reveal.""  And you're left snoozing and rolling your eyes.  And being offended by the decision to put such young kids in the midst of such ghastly killings -- and even have one of them ultimately weild the axe.  Yes, THE SIXTH SENSE was a great film -- but hopefully Mr. M. Night will put an end to the trend of ""twist endings"" by telling some straightforward stories himself -- ones that shock and intrigue without relying on fake outs.",Frailty

353,JackDeth1985,Bill Paxton's awesome directorial debut.,10,5 May 2002,"Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) goes to the FBI to tell them he believes his brother is the ""God's Hand"" kill, the name for a string of murders in Texas. Fenton recalls when the murders began to happen, back in 1979. Fenton's father (Bill Paxton) had a vision while sleeping that God told him that demons are walking the Earth in human form and Fenton's father and others like him are the only ones to stop them. Fenton's father then takes up the task of killing these demons while embroiled in a fight with Fenton. Fenton however believes his father has gone crazy, though Fenton's brother, Adam, does not think so and believes what his father has told him.Bill Paxton's directorial debut is great. He uses odd camera angles, sound effects, and very limited special effects to provoke a feeling. Paxton uses what he has, saying that the movie is relatively low budget for a theatre release, and really gives you a movie that you are going to think about after you have walked out of the theatre. Another great part of the movie is the soundtrack, it may not be the great piece of music ever written but it used very well.Overall, this movie is a horror movie but not like the other horror films in the genre to come out this year, like Blade 2, Resident Evil, or Jason X. This movie was created to provoke emotion, not scare you, but it does both.Overall : 5/5",Frailty
354,Mullzy,You have to see it for yourself...,8,24 April 2002,"I read a lot of the comments listed here and found many completely contrary to my own thoughts - so I felt I'd better add to the mayhem.  Some have negatively implied (or said straight out) that FRAILTY suffers an identity crisis, but I found this to be the STRONGEST part of the movie.  It is very much different from anything I have ever seen before - and although predictable at times - is very refreshing throughout.  It concentrates on the 3 family members more than the horrible acts performed.  It does not 'glorify' death and killing like so many horrible serial killer movies. It tells the story of a family - a family that makes you shake your head many times during the film.There are moments when you laugh at the scene/actor(s)/dialogue.  Some have said these moments were 'unintentional' and therefore detracted from the quality of the movie.  I'd have to disagree here as we are watching this story unfold as an 'observer'.  Most of what is said is SUPPOSED to seem ridiculous to us, as unbelieving viewers - much like the way we all laughed at that lady that announced aliens would land during the past Winter Olympics.  ""She's nuts!"" we all thought.FRAILTY is not THE SIXTH SENSE, it is not one of the top 10 suspense/horror movies of all time, but it IS very good and very fresh.  Like any movie, some will despise the very things that others love the most about it.  The only way to know for sure, is to see it for yourself.8/10",Frailty

Granted I am not a genius by any stretch of the imagination but come on man! Treat me as if I have half a brain at least. For example:Why the hell does Bill or who ever casted for this movie go through hundreds of casting calls and have to have the blonde boy and then color his hair? Why? the kid (the older one) was no damn acting prodigy. They couldn't pick a boy who actually had dark hair? out of thousands of young boys???He looked like Andrew McCarthy at the end of Pretty in Pink!The older kid (I don't remember his name and don't really care) has no one that misses him while he's under ground for two or three weeks? he has no teachers? friends? neighbors? Also, he says he is afraid of his dad that's why he can't say anything... I never detected any fear what so ever coming from that boy! And then when he finally does tell they begin the worst acting sequence and dialog I have ever seen and heard. Where did they get that guy!

Bill Paxton does his best (under his own direction) to play a lone father of two who gets a vision from the Old Testament version of God and completely loses his mind.

360,tbonewilson,A Little Disappointed,6,25 September 2002,"To start off, I had heard that this movie was excellent.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but that is not exactly true.  Now, for my possible explanations for and questions about the unexplained aspects of this film.SPOILERSThis is going to be very confusing,First of all, to the people who are confused about the ambulance.  Adam used the ambulance as a story to lure the FBI agent into his plan.  We know that this is the case by referencing the murder of the old man earlier in the movie, when Bill Paxton forces Fenton to cooperate by telling the man that his dog is under the car.  My problem with all of this deceit is that if they are using the hand of God to kill demons, are all of the lies really necessary?  They seem to add an evil element to their actions, which I think contradicts their motives.  Also, just to throw this in there, the angel that Bill Paxton sees under the car was not necessary, either.  It just looked fake and out of place, especially with the out-of-place flames behind him.  Now for the mixup concerning Adam and Fenton.  Obviously, Adam is the real narrator of the story.  Unfortunately, he tells Fenton's story with such detail that it is hard to believe that he made all of it up at the end of the movie.  I feel that this could have been prevented if the movie were filmed through more of Adam's and Bill Paxton's point of view instead of Fenton's.  The reason I feel this way is because the audience relates to Fenton far too much during the movie and then we find out that the story about him is probably not even true, seeing how Adam used it just to fool the FBI agent.  Now for the scene where Adam does not touch the FBI agent. I completely understand this scene, however, I don't understand later why the FBI agent does not put the handcuffs on him.  It seems to me that if you are going to let the prisoner put on their own handcuffs, you do it out of sight.  That is not the case in this scene, though, and if that is not enough, Adam almost puts himself in a situation where the FBI agent is going to put the handcuffs on him, even though he knows this would be disastrous. Now, to a totally different subject, is the list we see at the end of the movie the original list or is it new?  That is not discussed, nor is the amount of people that Adam has killed discussed.  This lack of information is accentuated by the box for the movie, which states that the God's Hand Killer is back, but since when.  Was the killing of Fenton his first resurgence or were there more, we're never told.  This is just bad writing, because it is hard for the viewer to understand the evil contained within Adam if we do not know how many people, if any, he has killed.  Also, why is Fenton considered a demon, because he killed his dad?  If this is the case, why was he not put on the list earlier?  All of the other victims were of a similar age at the time they sinned as when they were killed but not Fenton. On another note, at the end of the movie, we see Adam's accomplice, maybe it's his wife, but we are never really introduced to her, so the question posed, is did she just come under Adam's influence or is she one of God's Hands as well?  This is not explained.  There are many more questions that I have, such as why would the Sheriff not believe Fenton and why would he go into the basement of the shed by himself?  And if Adam was a serial killer, why didn't Fenton kill him as well?  And why would the FBI agent take Adam into the woods at night, even when he thinks that he is Fenton, is this really smart?  I don't think so.  Anyway, all of the problems with this movie could be cleaned up with some tighter writing but since they were not it will remain as a weak thriller.  I can't understand the people who say that the movie is creepy.  The only way it could be creepy is if it were like Usual Suspects in that you really don't believe the ending.  Unlike Usual Suspects, however, we can easily believe the ending.  The main difference occurs when in Usual Suspects a person can draw conclusions at the end of the film relating the surprise to actions during the film such as with the wanted poster and the bottom of the coffee cup.  There are no connections like this in Frailty, which causes the viewer to believe that the writers simply slapped the ending onto the movie without any understanding of the negative consequences.",Frailty

I think it is one of the best movies made in the last 10 years.My only problem is not really with the movie but with Ebert's seeming change of heart. After he and Roeper praised it enthusiastically; after Ebert said it was one of the best movies of the year, neither included it on their top ten. Heck, Ebert didn't even give it honorable mention!

I have never really been a fan of any of the actors, which would probably explain why I didn't catch ""Frailty"" when it was still in its first-run. This movie scared the hell out of me, quite simply. In this world of bizarre cults, religious fanatics, weekly Armageddons, etc., it would be easy to imagine a misplaced, misguided, or just plain crazy guy declaring his intention to heed the word of the Lord and start killing ""demons."" The fact that he dragged his two young sons into this carnage made it all the more sick and twisted - especially the younger boy, whose enthusiasm for his father's ""mission"" turned my stomach. Only Fenton, the older boy, seemed to have a conscience. However, thanks to a wonderful script and excellent direction, we find out that even this is not exactly the truth. Or is it? The ending of the film, when the viewer discovers that each of the so-called ""demons"" executed by Mr. Meiks was indeed a murderer, leaves room for doubt about the sanity everyone involved (including the detective with matricidal tendencies).

Right! These are exactly my reasons to rate this film A+. Just listen to people, there may be even too much acting right in this way.

375,kelliej,2 out of 10,2,22 April 2002,I don't understand how this movie scored so high by so many people.  It was boring and predictable. I thought some of the scenes were cheesy (i.e. the angel that the Dad saw when working on the car) Save your money and rent sixth sense again.,Frailty
376,bookblush,Haunting,9,15 April 2002,"Excellent film.  I haven't been this creeped out since 'The Exorcist'. I'm not going to go into the plot (you can read any number of reviews for that information), I just wanted to warn viewers to pay close attention to the sequence of events at the end of the film - and to remember just because a person has a 'vision' of the past doesn't necessarily mean that the events actually took place.  Pay close attention to what each character actually says and does at the moment (you'll know what I mean).
I would have to say that the only short fall the movie has is the somewhat befuddled ending.  But the body of the work more than makes up for it!A must see.",Frailty
377,yamadam,DO NOT see this one in the theatre. It's a WASTE OF MONEY!,5,16 April 2002,"I don't know about you, but I knew exactly what was going to happen, and what the big ""twist"" was going to be, within the first ten minutes of this film.  It's terribly obvious. Unfortunately, it seems the filmmakers were banking on this twist to make the movie, because the rest of the film is lacking in any redeeming qualities: it's slow in developing the story, lacks suspense and the good acting necessary to create it, and the ending is just plain stupid. If they had only cut out a few bad words and toned down the violence a little, they might have had an average ABC Sunday night movie. But, to be completely honest, either way I'd probably watch Max Bickford instead.",Frailty

379,krippler98,Absolutely Stunning,10,23 July 2006,"This move is, as said above, absolutely stunning.The acting is very solid, the sets and scenery are well-done, the script is complete, and the plot (the most important part)was utterly mind-blowing.I can honestly say that I have not seen many movies that have been as ""creepy"", for lack of better words, as this. There was no way that I would have expected the ending, as I, along with most of the other viewers, thought that Dad Meiks was just a delusioned murderer who puts his reasoning for his crimes in his fanaticism for religion. However, for those who have seen the movie, this is not how the film turns out. It is not only this, however, that is the only thing in the movie that chills me down to the bone. Also in the movie, young Adam Meiks willingly takes the bait from his father as eagerly as a child receiving birthday presents. I, being only 16, wondered whether or not this could actually happen in real life, if a child would murder another if given a chance from his guardian, albeit a poor one.In summary, this movie is well worth the watch and I hope all who read this will give it a chance.P.S. - To all of those who saw this movie as a way to ""justify"" murder with a religious cause, just how is that true? No matter what, in every way, shape and form, this is only a MOVIE. This is NOT a textbook. Movies are only meant for entertainment purposes, not to teach people to kill others.Anyway, i give it a 10.",Frailty

The acting is this film is superb especially among the younger stars, it was very unexpected. This film reminded of movies like ""Children of the Damned"" which instead of gore used questions to scare the audience. It also held twists which were flawlessly pulled off by the actors.

Unfortunately this movie has to do with Christianity, which I am, and many people, especially Christians need to comment on it.I felt it was a very good well thought out movie, and yes, if you read the other comments very disturbing, however that is how good thrillers are....Silence of the Lambs would be a good example....that you are still disturbed after the movie and think about it.

As soon as I saw that the entire movie was going to be told in flashbacks with voice overs, I knew this was going to be a VERY long and VERY boring movie. I had to fight to stay awake and my girlfriend even dozed off a few times and STILL knew what was going on when she woke up again. As she said when it ended ... remember, the DVD only cost the half as much as an afternoon matinée ... thank god for that! Convoluted and predictable, poorly plotted out and badly directed. Story unfolds way too slowly and in such a straight-highway-through-the-desert kind of way that if you don't know what is going to happen by the end of this film you slept through more of it than my girlfriend did.Bill, you should be ashamed of yourself!",Frailty

I didn't really know what to expect as I had only skim-read the back of the DVD case, but I really enjoyed this film and would watch it again. I love films that leave you guessing and then added with a twist makes this film perfect viewing entertainment. A clever film that doesn't use gore to substitute for lack of storyline (it has a minimal gore, which is used intelligently), it also has many minor twists and turns throughout keeping the action flowing without out going to fast or losing audience attention.Overall - an excellent film, I would definitely recommend this!!!",Frailty

This movie is sick and I left it (and got my money back) after the ***maybe a spoiler, but more of a warning*** first murder by the father, while forcing his two very young children to participate while the older of the two screamed `Please dad don't do it!'.  A part of me wanted to stay to see how it ended, because at least I could have rationalized it in some sick way, but just could NOT physically or mentally do it (and I hope the people that did stay, stayed to watch it for some rationalization and not because they really are that sick).",Frailty

I do not want to give away the ending, but other viewer comments claiming that the ending was totally predictable, and that they had it all figured out are BALONEY!!

391,king-moo,Plot holes and clichés galore. Avoid if you care about good storytelling.,2,30 October 2012,"This is my first review in years of using this site, I just can't quite believe that most of the negative reviews here are focused only on the morals or messages. This film could have stood for the most gracious principles mankind will ever consider, but it would still be almost completely terrible. So, I'm not going to criticise this film for any moral reasons, films can have whatever message they like in my opinion and I'll take or leave them accordingly.Spoilers start from here.This story was filled with holes and ridiculous, horror-cliché decisions such as: The FBI agent who willingly goes with a weirdo into a murderer's burial ground in the middle of a dark and stormy night; A son cordially agreeing to join and lock himself with his axe wielding and violently insane father, who he is scared of, into the shed where he has watched him kill people; The local sheriff who just won't believe the kid when he reports that his dad is a murderer, before taking him back home and getting axe murdered by... yep, the Dad; The same sheriff, of a small town, dies and apparently nobody cares; A public garden in a busy suburban town is covered in surfaced burial mounds of murder victims - these things are a good foot out of the floor! - and nobody cares or even notices them; Then there is the good old pointless twist at the end where it turns out the guy talking to the FBI agent has been lying and is in fact somebody else... These are just some of the more obvious annoyances.I like to see films out though once I've started. But as the film grew to a close, far from ironing out any cracks, it provided us with the unbelievably stupid idea that the killer is quite literally doing the work of his god by axe murdering people. And he will never be stopped or found because his god is pulling a bunch of amazing tricks such as preventing people from seeing his face on video tape or remembering what he looked like.Seriously I hope this review reaches somebody who appreciates good writing in cinema and it stops them from wasting their time. I'm giving it a star more than 1/10 because the main kid was a decent actor for his age.",Frailty

Pill Paxton is a father of two who has a vision of an Angel who tells him that him & his sons place on earth is to kill demons. He is later given a list of 7 names who are supposed demons, who he has to kill. Is he crazy, or is this really God's will?

395,RebeccaJones145,Though Provoking Film -- SPOILERS included,8,30 September 2002,"I couldn't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was.  The screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of Seven.  Not by changing the story - I think mainly through the cinematography.  The cinematography was the only thing that I found to be holding back the film.  On the other hand, the pacing was absolutely on point.  Whoever worked on the editing really did their job well.  And I thought Bill Paxton did a great job of directing. Now away from the technical stuff...This movie threw me for a loop.  SPOILER AHEAD!!!!  All along, I really felt that Bill Paxton was crazy and then when Adam finally took the FBI agent to the Rose Garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was, I got thrown for a loop.  I had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too (without any words spoken, simply by touch) sees it again with Adam and asks him how he knew.  My dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out 'bad guys' so to speak, knowing their sins and crimes already. I don't endorse an eye for an eye so I didn't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing God's work.  Instead I chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to, disturbed them permanently also.  That was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it's like a house of cards and a never-ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you've sat through.  It's definitely one of those movies where I'd love to be able to meet the writer so I could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all. Were they crazy and psychotic?  Were they simply telepathic and took license because of it?  Or did they have some sort of appearance from God? And if so, was it God or the Devil disguising himself as God.  My friends and I found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie.A definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it.  It's not a perfect film, but it definitely is it's own thing.  Great directorial work and acting by Bill Paxton and the child that played Fenton was extremely good.  I hope he doesn't end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise.  I gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film, but I would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something (although I can't pinpoint what) was off and if it hadn't have been, the movie would have gone to an even higher level. Still, a definite recommend, especially for those that are inquisitive.",Frailty

398,shocked_monkey,The only horror movie from Hollywood after Alien.,7,18 November 2008,"With seemingly effortless ease and humility, Bill Paxton achieves what many movie makers--both accomplished and undeserving--have attempted (and failed) to achieve ever since Ridley Scott's untouchable Alien.It's no mean feat; more so because the source is so unlikely.On the surface, describing this movie is easy. Frailty is a movie about a man who, along with his two sons, kills people because it is his God's will. But that's like saying Alien is about a ruthless alien who climbs aboard a spaceship and kills its crew one by one. Lacking.One day Bill Paxton's character tells his sons that he had a vision, and in that vision, from the heavens, he received the names of demons who looked just like people. Unless you were gifted with special sight, of sorts, like he is now. The list is an execution list. He receives implements to carry out this divine command in a scene so surreal (no other scene in the film thrusts doubt forward with as much clarity as this one) it would have failed in the hands of lesser craftsmen.And what doubt is that? Why, it's, on the face, as old as the times of Christ, if not older. Does God exist? That's the question.Underneath, though, is a much more important one. We're never quite sure till the last few minutes of the movie about whether the man was, indeed, carrying out the will of God, or whether this movie was a study in psychosis. And even after the movie ends, it's better (more unnerving) if we don't swallow the movie's ending, and chew on this issue a while.But that's not it, either. The most important question this film raises during its runtime is about the very nature of faith itself. Whether it is a man's faith in some higher power, or a child's simple, unquestioning faith in his personal God (yes, Paxton's children are accomplices in most of his murders). Which is more important? Which is more damaging?Yes, the movie ends in a twist, cursed as it is with existing in a Shyamalan genre; yes, the movie's stand on that central doubt is pretty clear by the end; yes, I will refrain from any spoilers, though I find the concept of a twist ending ridiculous.But what precedes it is smart, pulls no punches in showing us things Spielberg might shy away from, tosses the idea of a God who will use his human tool to commit murder over and over again (Goodbye, Christ) at us like a tempting kiss, and demolishes the beams of most religions without even trying.And then you get to the question that keeps you up at night. The concept of a vengeful, killing God, or the idea of a man so deluded that, while the law might find him guilty, no religious man worth his salt can honestly hang without doubt: which is more comforting?",Frailty
399,cederschiold,WTF was that? (WARNING big spoilers),4,15 August 2013,"I don't know where to start. How this movie got a score of above 7 is beyond me. The production value is average at best, the acting OK but nothing to write home about and the script, my god the script. Normally I don't really mind a bad film, but this time I want my evening back.Who the hell came up with this story, the Westboro Baptist Church?This movie should be an abomination to both atheists and religious people. Atheists for the fact of a god-sponsored serial killer. Religious people for the fact of a god-sponsored serial killer (thou shall not kill?).If you're no fan of religious propaganda you should find something else to watch.

I think I was thrilled because of the music and not because of the movie itself! I bought the soundtrack right away. As for the movie, you should really watch it of you want to be thrilled. There's so much garbage out there like those so-called thrillers such as 'House Of Wax' and 'The Grudge' (two ""thrillers"" I've seen recently) and I can assure you that Frailty is not one of them. Unfortunately, Frailty is so underrated and it's a shame, because Frailty is the best thriller I've seen for years, plus it was a low-budget film.However, this cheapo is better than the high-budget thrillers from the bigger studios.

I thought the first 2/3 of it was very good. Unfortunately, the last 1/3 completely shot that to hell. I think there's this feeling in Hollywood (and within the movie-going public) that if you have a ""surprise"" plot-twist then the movie becomes an edgy thriller. Of course, this has worked to the advantage of many films in the past; however, a twist can just as easily turn something good completely around. This is exactly what happens in Frailty. The direction the film took towards the end was obvious and trite. The relationships between the characters and what they represented was reversed. This COULD be interesting. Unfortunately for this movie, the relationships between the characters and what they represented, in the first 2/3, was interesting and had a tension of its own, definitely supported by the acting and cinematography, but the story alone was incredibly powerful. The shift at the end ""shined a light"" on the characters that was hackneyed, b-movie garbage. It's almost comical how the plot twist achieves the exact opposite effect of what it should. Throughout the first 2/3, I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. The last 1/3, I knew exactly what was about to be ""revealed."" It was suddenly unpredictable-movie by-the-books.Overall I gave it a 7/10. I'm still debating whether I was being too kind or not. I tried to be fair since the majority of it was very good.

Although the movie is now 2 years old, I just viewed it for the first time - and enjoyed every minute of it.  The Rose Garden was beautiful - and learning some of the tricks on how it appeared to deteriorate (via the special features on the DVD) was just as interesting as the movie itself.

406,ripesound,Political and Religious Propaganda,2,5 November 2006,"The basic proposition of this film (it turns out in the end) is that it is good to do bad things as long as it's to 'bad' people. Abortion doctors and Iraqi citizens beware.What started out as a very impressive directorial debut transforms itself in an instant into a sour and pointless experience. Both in terms of story structure and the underlying message conveyed this film takes a serious misstep, more than any other film I think I have ever seen.Paxton really could have had it all, he blew it, and I mean he really threw it away. On a technical story telling level and in terms of the broader moral and social implications this film fails. What starts out as intelligent and subtle becomes clumsy and stone aged in a single scene. The message really seems to be that in certain circumstances, when you think god is talking to you for instance, it is okay to take the law into your own hands and violently murder people, er, I mean 'demons'. I mean for goodness sake, isn't that what Islamic extremists are doing when they strap explosives to themselves and walk into a busy market? A far superior film about a Dad who turns into an axe murderer is Stanley Kubrik's 'The Shinning'. Now there's an outstanding movie, and a much better depiction of the supernatural into the bargain.I will give 'Frailty' a 2, and that is being extraordinarily generous.

I can't even compare it to any other movie I have every seen.It takes place in Texas at a FBI office were they have been searching for the God's Hand Killer. Matthew McConaughey plays Fenton Meiks a Man who comes to visit the FBI Agent who is working on the case to tell him he knows who the God's Hand Killer is.What happens next is a whirlwind of events, and flash backs into young Fenton ,and his younger brother Adam's life. That's were Bill Paxton comes in, by far one of the craziest roles I've ever seen him in.It is a movie about good vs. evil, heaven vs. hell, and the twist at the end was crazy I didn't even see it coming.

408,liakopoulos1991,Failty????,3,26 November 2015,"This movie starts decent , acting is normal there is also a sense of mystery the cast is good so what could go wrong? Well we will get there.. SPOILERS ALERT the rest of the review contains major spoilers read at your own accord. We see a family 2 sons and a father and suddenly the father has a god epiphany and needs to murder all the bad people god tells him to, so what do we think? A highly paranoiac father going in to a killing spree forcing his sons to help him sounds like a fair plot. Mystery on which son did the murders , watching character development of the main protagonists , acting seeming good enough for this plot , Bill Paxton punishing the child of his who refuses to just random kill people in the name of god, yeah it looks like a nice dramatic psychological thriller but NOPE no no no The movie takes a 360* angle flip. Was the father deranged? NOPE where the killings an act of paranoia ? NOPE are the protagonists some how in any way mentally ill ? NOPE is child torturing acceptable in the name of god and not disturbing at all YEP. In other words this movie tells us, dudes if you see a vision of some angel and some list to kill people go do it its an act of god and don't worry you wont be punished cause believe it or not god protected them (none remembered their faces , cameras where blurred during McConaugheys interrogation so yeah good god cleaned up for those murders). So recapping the father of the family was not insane he was 100% sane.. so the acting goes from decent to horrible, same goes for all the protagonists of this movie excluding the young ones. In this religious sick movie the main idea is of following your visions and slaughtering in the name of god is acceptable and also rewarding. So instead of watching a psychological thriller with a mentally deranged killer going into a spree and instead of watching his abused children continuing his spree what do i get? A good Christian teaching his children the good ways of god , a good father who rightfully abuses his infidel child and the rewards of an eternal good and merciful god. In my opinion crap movies like this one need to be banned ,and no crap is a good term cause even a piece of crap has a greater morale to teach than this movie. The only reason this movie gets a 3/10 is cause the acting , directing and generally the movie excluding the final 30 minutes is decent, but i ll rather prefer to burn my eyes with boiled tomato sauce and then remove them with a spoon than watching this sick piece of film making again....",Frailty
409,andrew-peel11,Great dark thriller,8,1 September 2011,Well worth renting on DVD or watching on TV if it comes up. Bill Paxton does a great job as the central 'bad guy' and Matthew McConaughey sells his role very well.If you enjoy dark thrillers then this film is for you. I always find thrillers involving children particularly disturbing. Especially if they are made to act in ways that they loose their innocence.As there a lots of other reviews with spoilers I will leave them out of this review.The basic plot is very dark and disturbing about the mind of a religiously motivated killer. The twist at the end is well worth watching the film.You will watch the film thinking you have worked it out.

Technically, it's well done and it has some scenes that will have you at the edge of your seats. But who the hell financed its making? The ""United States Christian Serial Killer Association""?? The movie seems to be saying that guys who kill a lot of people, claiming that God told them to do it- are probably right! They know things you and I don't. Hello?? What kind of message is THAT? That the brother showing up at the office of the Powers Boothe character turns out to be the younger brother who naively went along with the lunacy of his father from the beginning was a nice plot twist, but what follows as soon as they reach the notorious rose garden is an insult to the audience. Even if you're a Christian -which I am not- there can't be any justification for the message this movie's ending is sending, what with ""Thou shalt not kill"" and all...these self-styled demon-killers would roast in hell.",Frailty
411,wrathfulbuddha9,My entire review is a SPOILER!,1,23 July 2004,"Well, at least a few viewers saw this film for what it really is: nothing more than ultra-conservative propaganda; a pro-death penalty movie ""in sheep's clothing;"" and a millennial, new testament ""end times"" movie.If you dispute my opening sentence, consider the following...1) The murderer goes completely unpunished by the end of the film. As another reviewer aptly put it, the director didn't take ""the stinger"" out.2) The fact that the director didn't remove ""the stinger"" strongly suggests that the film was intended to have the following disturbing and controversial ""morals:"" a) That only a chosen few christians have the ability to ""see"" ""true EEEEVILL;"" b) those who don't believe in the ""christian god"" are ""demons,"" so it's okay to torture and ""off"" them, even if they happen to be one's own sons or brothers.3) The film takes place in ""pro death"" Texas. I couldn't help but think that, in this respect, it was the antithesis of the equally crummy and self-righteous, but politically opposed, The Life of David Gale. Incidentally, it's probably no coincidence that the ""holy"" trinity/""choir"" of adult actors that starred in this movie--Paxton, Boothe, and McConaghey (sorry if I spelled the latter's name wrong; he's never been one of my favorite actors anyway) are all from Texas.4) Many other reviewers (here and elsewhere) seem inexplicably puzzled by the title of the movie. It seems fairly obvious to me that ""Frailty"" refers to the character Fenton Meiks, who is too morally ""frail,"" i.e. weak/""meek"" to see the ""demons"" and carry out ""god's will."" The family's surname probably has another connotation as well, i.e. the biblical proclamation that ""the meek shall inherit the earth,"" but obviously that connotation would refer more to Fenton's more ""righteous"" father and brother. As an aside, the youngest son is biblically named Adam.5) Also, while I'm at it, nice outdated, i.e. ultra-conservative, portrayal of women in this movie: one was apparently being depicted as a ""tramp"" whom we are supposed to assume deserved to get the ax, presumably because Daddy Meiks' 'vision'/flashback showed her sleeping with a guy wearing a dog collar (fundamentalists once again telling us what 'god' thinks people should and shouldn't do in the privacy of their own bedrooms); and the sheriff's dispatcher was depicted as nothing more than the subservient conspirator for the ""righteously murderous Adam,"" and the pregnant vessel for carrying the next generation of ""demon slayers"" (oh brother). To my recollection, there were only four other females shown, or alluded to in the male-dominated film: the little girl who was the victim of one of the ""demons;"" the woman inside the house, to whom another ""demon""/victim shouted, ""shut up, bitch;"" the FBI agent's mother whom we later find out he had ""whacked"" years earlier, and whose photo sat lovingly on his desk; and Mama Meiks who died in childbirth and was conveniently out of the picture, along with any other shred of family that they had. Yeah, nice old-fashioned, ultra-conservative depiction of women: either helpless victims or merely vessels, while the ""men folk"" do all of ""god's bidding."" Give it a rest! I used to be a fan of ""Wild Bill"" Paxton, but after watching this film, he has been added to my ""Mel Gibson List"" of fanatic ""actors-turned-directors"" that need to get off of their soapbox...although at least Paxton had the restraint not to turn this into the ""gorefest"" that Mel Gibson made his Passion of the Christ into.Incidentally, the ""visitation under the car"" scene was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Had I had any inkling of what this movie was really about before I saw it (it was ""sold"" to me by a friend as something completely different), I wouldn't have wasted my time on it. Also, it was such a poor rip off of The Dead Zone, The Usual Suspects--but those films were so much better--and at least a half dozen other movies, it was almost embarrassing.Borrowing from a clever review I read elsewhere, this story would've been fine for the year 1001, but in 2001 it just comes across as a bunch of superstitious hooey. Thankfully, the same first amendment that gave these religious fanatics the right to make this film, gives me the same right to shred it.1/10",Frailty

413,lazlo8969,Holy Rollers Unite!!,2,1 December 2010,"If your a holly rolling,Bible thumping whack job still out from behind bars slaying those demons for god your just going to love this moronic and mindless religious dribble!But on another side of things Matthew McConaughey (who in my opinion usually comes off as a dumb surfer no matter what role hes in)gave the most believable and powerful performances of his career. And the two child actors did an excellent job as well. It's just ashame that for as much talent was cast into this project that the story just couldn't have gone in a different direction. I don't feel the message this movie sends is one that should be.",Frailty
414,lailaahmed-24134,thought provoking,10,18 July 2015,"I have never come across anyone who has watched this film, one of my favorites , you have to think and it challenges your beliefs, whether you are an atheist or a person of faith. Picked it up in a video rental shop , it grabbed me from start to finish.Such an unusual topic for a film , serious religious undertones of a fundamental sense ,but then veers into more spiritual territory , more akin to Sufi or agnostic strands of belief.The trailer makes it sounds like a slasher movie which it really is not If you have not seen it get a copy fast , there has not been another like it",Frailty
415,matheus_maciel_jc,A film to get angry,1,18 June 2020,"A film to get angry: a psychopathic father; stupid sheriff; teenager complacent about his father's murders.This absurdly ridiculous plot forces an interpretation of ""justice"" made by Adam from his ""divine visions"" which legitimizes his actions.
Have you ever thought if every crazy sociopath, who has visions, acts in the world according to his sense of justice? Oh and it happens, unfortunately ...",Frailty
416,riadrijvi,"A magnificent plot , deep suspense through every corridor but not a satisfactory finishing",7,2 November 2016,"A father with an imaginary vision who wants to transmit it to his two sons.The vision which is too deadly for both body and mind for the sons.what is more tragic is this vision leads to a series of murder and the involvement of children's. Matthew McConaughey has played the suspense making role throughout the movie.The fight against the wrong even if you are a weakest creature could be a message from that movie.The acting is so real and everybody has done way better than just good including the kids.Things goes much more complicated when one sees the brothers are quite identical to each other from each one's view.This movie may not serve your expectation rather it may put you in a position where you can be much frustrated and somehow disturbed by the twist.Nevertheless,this movie has almost every element which a proper thrilling and mysterious movie might have.But the execution of these elements may not be quite right at the end which was frustrating for me.The surrounding and environment of the movie is superb which will keep you always in attention.The suspense was literally built up quite nicely and will stir up your mind strongly.According to myself ,this movie is worth watching if you are a mystery and thriller movie lover.",Frailty
417,lableau24,I just can't get past Bill,4,11 June 2006,"I am shocked to see that this has such a high rating. I saw this in the theater and the crowd booed... a lot. Mediocrity is a killer. The story is a good one, maybe even great. I have to give it up that it's a outstanding idea for a creepy flick. I had to go back a couple years later and watch it again because the God's Hand story is one that stuck with me. Can anyone really take Bill Paxton seriously? I know I can't. I just laugh at him. Not be a jerk but the guy just comes off as a goon. This is how he got famous right? He's great in Aliens and his car salesman part in True Lies is still hysterical. My opinion, get different actors and this movie is gold.",Frailty
418,searchtheshadows,I'm lost,1,8 March 2019,"Frailty starts with an intense, ominous and admittedly good opening score by Brian Tyler. It ends with a shot that continues to irritate me to this day. Everything else is details. Fair warning there are spoilers in this. It's the only way I can properly do it its lack of justice.
Frailty opens with Fenton Meiks played by Matthew McConaughey, incidentally the only actor in the film with a noticeable Southern drawl. It's as though he's out of place and he knows it. He brings zero character to this role. He tries to appear nonchalant before revealing deep family secrets here. Quite frankly he just looks bored.
The secret is that his brother Dave is the notorious God's Hand killer. Powers Boothe plays the FBI agent on the case. Here he seems unconvincing, almost as though he's trying to cocky and can't quite pull it off. There's zero tension between McConaughey and Boothe here or at any other point in the film but moving on.
We are quickly transported back into the past where young Fenton and Dave, played by Jeremy Sumpter and Matt O'Leary play the younger brothers, living under the strain of a father slowly going off the deep end. Fenton, played by O'Leary is convinced something's wrong, while Dave, is convinced otherwise. I'll give kudos to both kids, especially O'Leary who embraces the role full throttle. Never for one second do we disbelieve him.
Paxton, in his directorial debut, plays Dad Meiks. Convinced that he is assigned to rid the world of demons.
The way in which the angel comes to him though reeks of bad CGI and could have been done, in my opinion, differently. Also, I will never understand how an FBI agent offered up the information he did, nor why he followed Fenton to his brother's burial ground. I'll never fathom how young Fenton managed to dig the hole his father requested in the time frame he had. There is a scene where Paxton and the two brothers are having dinner where the dialogue was stilted to the point of being borderline laughable. It's as though Brent Hanley focused too much on the dysfunctional and left everything else to the wayside. Horror is in the everyday. Good writers both know and utilise this.
Paxton is no more subtle, using various borrowed techniques to attempt to create an atmosphere of fear and dread, but it falls flat. At one point there's a shot that is an attempt to replicate early film noir, but it's so tremendously forced and out of place there is zero impact. Perhaps that's what bothered me the most. Frailty didn't scare me. It's a contrived attempt at a point with a lousy script and a visionless director.
You've been warned.",Frailty
419,bluescbeatnu,One my favorite movies,10,3 February 2006,"This is one of those movies that, after watching it, you will keep thinking about and coming back to even months after viewing. The acting is spectacular for starring two children (I usually hate movies with whiny kid acting). Bill Paxton is awesome, his directorial debut is even better than what I expected of an actor whose most memorable line is ""Game over, man! Game over!"" (from the movie ""Aliens"").The best part about the movie is the dichotomy between those scenes where the actors play a family, and when they are doing their ""work."" It really makes the movie believable and memorable.Keep it up, Bill. I'll be waiting for more movies I""m sure to love!",Frailty

It emphasizes the concept that reality is only perception, and that perception can be cultivated through emotions like fear, love, hate and desire.",Frailty
