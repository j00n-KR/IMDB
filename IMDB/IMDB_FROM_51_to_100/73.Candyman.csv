0,SnoopyStyle,love the visual styles,6,23 September 2021,"In Chicago, artist Anthony McCoy and his girlfriend Brianna Cartwright are hosting a dinner for her brother Troy and his boyfriend. Anthony is looking for new inspiration. Troy recounts the story of Cabrini-Green and a bastardized urban legend of Helen Lyle, the woman in the original 1992 movie.Jordan Peele is doing more writing and producing. I really love the visual look. I love the shadow puppetry, the cold brutal cityscape, and the use of mirrored surfaces. Around the midpoint, I noticed that there is a lack of overtly scary scenes. It has the imagery but I'm not scared. I realized that the protagonist is a muscular black man. In a horror, the vulnerability of the protagonist is directly proportional to the fear generated. For a young black man, he's most vulnerable with the police or in a KKK clan meeting. This movie probably needs the protagonist to be a young vulnerable female victim. This could be a father daughter movie with Anthony being the father figure. While Anthony is always in danger, it's not the type of danger that generates real intensity. That's really the only missing element. The protagonist needs more vulnerability.",Candyman
1,nogodnomasters,Say My Name,6,12 September 2021,"We see an incident with the Candyman take place in 1922 and then we go to the present where artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) hears a story about Helen Lyle and how she tried to sacrifice a young boy. Upon research he discovers the story of the Candyman and how it relates to the racial struggle in South Chicago. He creates an art piece with a mirror in tribute to the Candyman where he revives the ""Bloody Mary"" dare. And then the horror happens.It wasn't the same without the deep voice of Tony Todd. They even did a cover for Sammy Davis jr. Having said that, it was fine for a horror film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Candyman
2,jboothmillard,Candyman,7,8 September 2021,"When I saw the trailer, I assumed this was going to be a remake of the cult 90s scary movie (that's what happens when filmmakers use the same title in recent years. In fact, it is a direct sequel, which was delayed by COVID, I was very excited when it was finally released, written and produced by Jordan Peele (Get Out). Basically, in Chicago, it has been thirty years since the events at the Cabrini-Green housing project. Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is a visual artist who has recently moved into an apartment with his girlfriend, art gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris). One night, Brianna's brother Troy (Misfits' Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) shares the urban legend of Helen Lyle, a graduate student who went on a killing spree in the early 1990s. Her rampage culminated in a bonfire outside Cabrini-Green when she attempted to sacrifice a baby. The residents were able to rescue the child before Helen perished in the fire. Following a scathing meeting with art critic Finley Stephens (Rebecca Spence), Anthony is desperate for a creative spark to turn his career around. He becomes interested in this urban story and goes to Cabrini-Green for inspiration. Exploring the abandoned part of the project, he encounters laundromat owner William Burke (Colman Domingo), who introduces him to the story of the Candyman. When Burke was a child, he was frightened by an encounter with Sherman Fields (Michael Hargrove), a hook-handed man whom the police believed was responsible for putting a razor blade in a piece of candy that ended up in the hands of a white girl. Burke inadvertently alerted the police to Sherman hiding behind the walls of one of the tower blocks, and the racist officers beat Sherman to death. When children continued to receive candy with razor blades inside, Sherman was cleared of the accusations, and the legend implies that if somebody says ""Candyman"" in a mirror five times, Sherman's spirit will appear and kill the person who summons him. Anthony is inspired by this story and develops an art exhibit called Say My Name, based on the Candyman's legend. It consists of a bathroom mirror containing a bloody lair inside and showcases it at Brianna's art gallery. He is dismayed when it does not get a positive reaction from audiences. That night, one of Brianna's co-workers and his girlfriend are slaughtered by the Candyman after saying his name five times in front of Anthony's mirrored exhibit. The legend spreads, and more people are killed after repeating the Candyman's name, including the art critic and a group of teenage girls at a school. While exploring Cabrini-Green, Anthony was stung by a bee on his right, which develops into a huge scab, and since then he has undergone a physical transformation spreading across his entire body. He goes to a hospital, where learns that his mother lied about where he was born, and when he confronts his mother, Anne-Marie (Vanessa Estelle Williams), she reluctantly reveals that he was the baby Helen rescued from the fire the night she died. Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd) was the first Candyman, Anne-Marie never told Anthony about these events because she wanted him to have a normal life. The community had vowed never to repeat the Candyman's legend after that night, and she fears what will happen now that someone has broken the pact. Worried about Anthony, Brianna goes to Cabrini-Green to find him and Burke, who she realises first told him about the Candyman. At the laundromat, she is attacked and subdued by Burke, who takes her to an abandoned church where Anthony, his body continuing to deteriorate, is waiting. Anthony starts blacking out and tries to save Brianna as Burke reveals that he not only witnessed Sherman's death, he also saw Sherman's spirit returning as the Candyman and witnessed him murdering his older sister and her friend, who summoned him. Burke plans to have the police gun Anthony down to create a new legend with the Candyman as an instrument of vengeance rather than a symbol of Black pain and suffering. To complete Anthony's transformation into the Candyman, Burke saws off his right hand and replaces it with a hook. Brianna manages to escape the church and is chased through Cabrini-Green by Burke, whom she viciously stabs to death. Anthony appears and collapses into her arms as the police, called by Burke, show up and shoot Anthony dead. Brianna is arrested and handcuffed, an officer in the police car attempts to question her and agree a story that Anthony provoked the police into shooting him. Brianna uses the police car's rear-view mirror to summon the Candyman. He appears, now in Anthony's guise, and massacres the police. As more police arrive at the scene, Anthony's body is swarmed with bees, changing momentarily into Burke, and then taking on the appearance of Robitaille and instructing Brianna to ""tell everyone"". Also starring Kyle Kaminsky as Grady Greenberg, Troy's boyfriend, Brian King as Clive Privler, and Virginia Madsen as the voice of Helen Lyle. Abdul-Mateen gives a terrific performance as the artist who becomes obsessed and possessed in equal measure striving for his art, the story of the original is cleverly interwoven, and this follow-up is more politically charged. It has many clever aspects in amongst the main story, from the creepy shadow puppetry in between the action to the origins of another Candyman (who actually has candy haha), it is superbly atmospheric, gory at the right moments, and to be honest, I think it's almost better than the original, a fantastic supernatural slasher horror. Very good!",Candyman
3,paul_haakonsen,"Not a great movie, but the best in the franchise...",5,17 September 2021,"After the less than impressive three prior ""Candyman"" movies from 1992, 1995 and 1999, I must admit that I was not overly thrilled about this 2021 movie from writers Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld and Nia DaCosta. But still, as the opportunity presented itself to watch this movie, I opted to sit down and do just that.And as luck would have it, then the 2021 version of ""Candyman"", from director Nia DaCosta, actually turned out to be the best in the franchise. Now, hold your horses, because I am not saying that this 2021 movie is a great masterpiece or anything. Nay, not at all. The 2021 ""Candyman"" is a watchable, albeit slow paced and semi-boring movie, but at least it proved more interesting than the previous three movies in the franchise.I had initially feared this 2021 version would be a remake of the original 1992 ""Candyman"" movie, so I was a bit reluctant to sit down and watch it. Thankfully it turned out not to be another pointless remake of something that had already been done and seen before. No, the 2021 ""Candyman"" movie is sort of a continuation of the first 1992 movie, and sort of doesn't acknowledge parts II and III. So it was actually pleasing to find out that the writers opted to continue on with the events and lore established in the first movie.The storyline told in the 2021 version was actually fairly good, albeit somewhat of a slow burn. So the movie can be something of an acquired taste. But if you enjoyed the previous three movies, then you will certainly also enjoy this latest addition to the franchise. I found the storyline to be entertaining enough, but it was lacking more pacing and also lacking more horror elements.And what the writers did with the legend of the Candyman and how it is something that comes about with every era, now that was something interesting, and it made the whole legend feel more alive and added a much needed depth to the legend. I am not going to spoil anything here with the story or legend, but the way this storyline became intervowen with the original 1992 storyline definitely felt good and felt like a wholesome way to go about doing it.The movie does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and I can only claim to be familiar with Colman Domingo, Vanessa Williams and of course Tony Todd. Actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, whom I have never heard of before now, definitely carried the movie quite well with his performance in the lead role.Visually then ""Candyman"" was actually good. The special effects were realistic and believable, and the appearance of Candyman was interesting. And since Tony Todd personified Candyman in the 1992, 1995 and 1999 movies, then it is a difficult task to nudge him off the perch, but I will say that this movie definitely provided something of a competitor to Tony Todd.As I mentioned earlier, then the 2021 ""Candyman"" was lacking in the horror department. Sure, this would be classified as a traditional horror movie, but it is by no means a slasher movie. And the Candyman character never have managed to step up to line up with the likes of Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and the like.I found ""Candyman"" from director Nia DaCosta to be watchable and entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, though it was by no means a milestone in horror cinema. Though, it was a step up for the franchise as a whole. My rating of the 2021 ""Candyman"" movie lands on a mediocre five out of ten stars.",Candyman
4,BandSAboutMovies,I wanted to love it.,3,23 September 2021,"Someone on my social feeds posted the other day that they still couldn't get this movie out of their mind days after watching it and I wondered, ""Where did they get the version of this film that I so desperately wanted to see?""Because after what feels like years of delays, this film finally was released and I'm struggling, quite honestly, to remember much of it. And what I do recall isn't that good. It felt unfocused at best, scattered and boring at worst.Which is a shame, because Candyman is one of the most unexpected and near-perfect horror films I've ever seen, a movie that effortlessly combined menace, terror, social commentary and reflected the world outside, all things that this movie shoots for and watches the ball circle the rim without ever scoring.But hey -- what do I know? It made $68 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.The story of the first film has become exactly what the Candyman promised it would be, as Helen Lyle is now a legend and the unrelenting blight of the Cabrini-Green housing project has been cleaned up and gentrified, which is mirrored by how Anthony McCoy takes the stories of where he grew up and sells them as art.Yet the story of who Candyman is moves his origins to 1977 and a man accused of placing a razor blade in a child's candy, which takes away from the power of the true origins of the character. The Sherman Fields version of the character takes away from the story until we finally get back to the Daniel Robitaille character and then gets further diluted by the concept that there is a hive of Candyman which discovers a new host every few years.A bee's sting and the push of a man named Billy Burke push McCoy toward becoming the next version of the urban legend, even as the kills that surround his story seem pulled from the worst Platinum Dunes-style 90s and 00s remakes of past horror films, particularly a scene in a girl's bathroom that seems tonally at odds with some of the wonderful moments of this film, like the animated origins that punctuate the narrative.I like so much of what director and writer Nia DaCosta -- along with producers and co-writers Win Rosenfeld and Jordan Peele -- are trying here, but the exact moment that the movie seems to be ready to mean something -- as McCoy's girlfriend must bring the avenging power of the Candyman to bear against the uncaring might of a white police force is the end of the film and then seemingly gets to what we really want to see. But by then, it's too late to do much.The main problem, at the end, is that the original film remains vital decades after I first saw it. This lost its potency while I was watching it. And that doesn't make me happy at all, because this was a movie that I was rooting and hoping for, as I feel that the character and mythos remain a vital canvas on which to paint deep lessons upon.",Candyman
5,CinemaSerf,Where's Sammy Davis Jr? He'd have been far scarier...,6,15 September 2021,"OK, so what was the point of this? You stand in front of the mirror and say his name five times then he comes and kills you. Well that would appear to be a rather self-defeating strategy to stay alive - for both the idiots who summon him and for the eponymous murderer himself? Anyway, our boogieman returns to Chicago some thirty years after his first outing to wreak havoc - always accompanied by bees/wasps/hornets - you tell me. It is not in the least scary. It's not even as if the jump scenes are too obvious, or too well advertised (even in the trail), there just aren't any - it's 2021s first horror-free horror film. When i say that, I ought to exclude the performances which are pretty horrific across the board - not least from top billed Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (yes, he of ""Aquaman"" fame). If it does have any redeeming features, then at least we get shot of some art gallery snobs in suitably brutal fashion and it is just under the 90 minutes if you flee once the credits start rolling. Otherwise, I'd skip this and maybe watch it on telly late one night after a few cases of Malbec, or perhaps watch the version with Matt Damon and Kirk Douglas - or was that ""Candelabraman""?",Candyman
6,zardoz-13,"A Good Movie, but an Anemic Chiller",8,24 October 2021,"""Little Woods"" director Nia DaCosta's lackluster ""soul sequel"" to Bernard Rose's seminal Gothic masterpiece ""Candyman"" (1992) qualifies as an anemic allegory about the evils of racial oppression and urban gentrification. Basically, DaCosta and scenarists Jordan Peel & Win Rosenfeld have forged a horror movie in the crucible of critical race theory. Specifically, critical race theory (CRT) argues white supremacy has subjugated minorities of color throughout America's history. Sadly, this superbly lensed and hauntingly scored chiller qualifies as far more topical than it is terrifying. The choice of the notorious Cabrini-Green Housing Project in Chicago as a setting qualifies as a damning enough indictment of white supremacy. Unfortunately, little about this introspective, R-rated, 91-minute movie will give you the shivers. Mind you, I've seen the new ""Candyman"" four times in theaters, and nobody has howled in horror. Since its late August debut, this $25 million Universal release has virtually doubled its budget at the box office. Now, no matter how smart and sophisticated the new ""Candyman"" is, the filmmakers forgot the essence of any industrial strength horror movie: buckets of blood & gore. Neither will your blood run cold nor dread paralyze you at the sight of the new Candyman. Horror movies prime audiences to anticipate the worst and then resort to hysterics when mayhem ensues. Sadly, legendary ghoul that the title character is, DaCosta's Candyman is barely seen slashing and gashing his victims. Inexplicably, DaCosta keeps this fiendish golem on a tight leash until the show-stopping finale. Candyman appears to be more of an eponymous guest than an eponymous ghoul. Emphasizing the social, racial, and political context, the filmmakers have changed Candyman from being merely a monster to mostly a martyr. Earlier, ""Don't Breathe 2"" rehabbed the original film's wicked villain as a hero, too. Similarly, DaCosta and company have reformed Candyman. They use Candyman's backstory to reveal how institutional white racism bred this boogeyman. The description of the beating the first Candyman suffered at the hands of whites in the 1890s sounded a lot like what happened to Emmett Till.The new ""Candyman"" draws on its legendary predecessor. The big difference between DaCosta's film and Rose's original is the protagonist. An African American artist has replaced the white female graduate student. A gifted painter, Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II of ""Aquaman"") endures a fate similar to the artist in Oscar Wilde's classic novel ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray."" Searching for something refreshing to inspire him, McCoy visits Cabrini-Green. While he is snapping photos of the infamous Chicago public housing project, he is stung by a bee. This is the first hint McCoy will evolve into Candyman. McCoy chats with long-time Cabrini resident William Burke (Colman Domingo of ""Assassination Nation"") who was alive when the ghoul with a right hook haunted the neighborhood. Burke regales McCoy with stories about Candyman and reviles the Chicago Police Department's presence in the hood. Primarily, Burke tells McCoy about his initial encounter with Candyman. Burke met the boogeyman when he was a youngster washing his laundry. He heard a piece of candy hit the floor. Moments later a lanky black man with a crooked smile emerged from a huge crack in the wall. He had a prosthetic split-hook for his right hand instead of Candyman's pirate hook. Suddenly, blue-clad CPD policemen burst into the laundry room. Although we don't see it on-screen, the police killed Candyman. Later, McCoy learns if anybody utters Candyman's name five times in front of a mirror, the maniac with the hook will materialize and eviscerate the individual. Using this premise, Anthony paints some experimental pictures and uses them in conjunction with a standard bathroom cabinet mirror that folds out to reveal those paintings behind it. Art promoter Clive Privler (Brian King of ""Widows"") exhibits McCoy's ""Say My Name"" artwork, but he doesn't want McCoy bothering snooty white art critic Finley Stephens (Rebecca Spence of ""Man of Steel""). Clive fears Stephens will trash McCoy's work as well as his art gallery for promoting the ""Say My Name"" display. After the show, Clive and his girlfriend Jerrica Cooper (newcomer Miriam Moss) decide to summon Candyman. Just about everybody who summons Candyman is slain. Whites are the primary target, but black teens in a room summon him and face the same dire fate.Indeed, Candyman kills, but he is depicted as more of a hands-off guy. When he strikes the first time, we see the deed not the doer. Afterward, all we see is his shadow on the wall. We see the slashed and gashed victims, but not the sadistic ghoul. That's a cheat! Later, during the girl's lavatory massacre, we are treated to blood, dying, and death, but we never see Candyman carrying out those savage acts. If you look closely at the compact mirror on the floor in the girl's restroom scene, you'll catch the merest glimpse of Candyman. This new Candyman projects little of Tony Todd's majesty and menace. The original Candyman benefited from Todd's daunting presence and towering height. Actually, all you'll see here is one of his legs levitating. Tony Todd oozed evil in the original and its two sequels. Comparatively, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is far less hideous. Even when he does go postal on the cops in Cabrini-Green in the last scene, Abdul-Mateen II never generates any of Todd's homicidal zeal. Ultimately, Candyman emerges as a symbol of racism and white supremacy. Not only does DaCosta and company treat the first film with reverence, but they also have developed the character of Anthony McCoy's obsessed artist. As it turns out, Anthony learns he was the baby Candyman wanted to sacrifice in the bonfire in the original film. Remember, Helen Lyle saved baby Anthony and returned him to his mother. Ultimately, despite its charismatic cast, top tier production values, Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe's edgy orchestral score and atmospheric shadow puppet shows, ""Candyman"" never sinks his hook into you with the devastating horror of the first film.",Candyman
7,Calicodreamin,Slow,4,8 September 2021,"Candyman dragged its hook to the bitter end, a very slow movie with a decided lack of slasher action. This read as more of an artisanal horror movie rather than a true killer horror film. The acting was decent and the effects worked, but too darn slow and not enough scares.",Candyman
8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"I guess I'm going to have to constantly make sure I'm not near a mirror, because I'm going to be talking about this one for a while",8,27 August 2021,"It's been just under 30 years since the events of the first film(this ignores the sequels, as we all should). Cabrini-Green has been gentrified. Anthony(Abdul-Mateen II, going from caring to gradually losing control), who lives there now, is a talented artist who has had a creative block for two years. He's expected to deliver a piece soon. So naturally, when he hears about the titular urban legend, and it inspires him, he starts looking into it... despite the increasing danger of doing so.It took four films, but we finally got an entry with a wealth of black people... on both sides of the camera. Seriously, how wild is it that the previous ones were all directed by white men? At least they did gradually increase the amount of cast members of colour. These have been exploring violence against African-Americans from the start, and now it's being told by people who know what it's like to actually fear that happening to themselves, to members of their families. Their perspective helps lead to this being the best yet, in the series.Jordan Peele continues to do an incredible job handling the genre. He knows when to subvert tropes and when to play them straight. How often the tension should be released by comedy instead of scares. This is less allegorical than Get Out and Us, whilst still fitting in a tremendous amount of social commentary and satire. BLM, police brutality, and the media coverage they get, are explored well. Nia DaCosta does an excellent job at the helm.This features a moderate amount of bloody, gory violence and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of horror that makes you think. 8/10.",Candyman
9,george.schmidt,Better than expected reboot of a '90s classic slasher flick,8,13 September 2021,"CANDYMAN (2021) *** Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Colman Domingo, Kyle Kaminsky, Vanessa Williams, Brian King, Miriam Moss, Rebecca Spence, Michael Hargrove.

10,trashgang,a lot of the slashing is off-camera,6,12 October 2021,"Who doesn't know the original Candyman, cult classic. Always tricky to reboot things like that. I know already that a lot of reboots were total crap only one was top notch, The Evil Dead.And so here we are with Candyman. The story is supernatural for sure so it's normal that not everybody will like this but the story itself is okay but sadly when the candyman do appears mostly of his revenge is done off-camera and that I can't take from a horror.Acting is okay and effects used are okay, even the score has something eery. But not giving away the hook going into the flesh is a mistake. The first killing was welldone and I thought, if this is the way this one is going it will be okay. But it wasn't.To be honest, it didn't bored me but i was left without some candy.Gore 1/5

Both movies have been done repeatedly and to be honest at one point enough should be enough. Candyman wasn't bad though but it's nothing like the first movie when it was all a surprise. I like Jordan Peele as a comedian but also as a writer, he has a vivid imagination and this shows in this movie. The acting wasn't bad, the story déjà-vu.

12,thesar-2,Never Say His Name Again,2,31 August 2021,"Okay, maybe I should've brought a mirror with me to say his name 5x in the opening act to save me from the remaining torture.What a surprisingly dull, listless, unscary and aimless horror sequel. It felt like the writers told the producers they have some great ideas and to just give them a couple of months to perfect them to which the producers replied: How's this weekend for your final draft?One thing I love hearing in comedic movie reviews online: Don't ever reference better movies in your bad movie. Well, this one constantly referenced the original with the great and highly missed duo: Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd. They were so integral, smart, deep and fun, they were that whole movie's heartbeat. Here, in this 2021 third sequel, you'll have none of that. Well, except for everyone, again, referencing them repeatedly.Let me get through the synopsis so I can end this misery of remembering this film. Two artists live together, one more successful than the other and the lessor of the two gets enthralled in the legend of the Candyman. Almost immediately, he's posed to be the male Helen Lyle (Madsen,) but his aimlessness around the movie, plot, scenes and characters makes him just a weird, nothing character you never care about.Anyhoo, as he continues to research and paint more about Candyman, the purposeful kill count rises. You may think he would be blamed for the killings and you'd be just as confused as the writers were.In fact, with the several writers this movie had, it's almost if some of them were stubborn. One would want him as the next Helen and another writer venomously disagreed and wrote him unique from Helen. And yet another writer snuck in and tried to blend the two halves...very horribly.I'm not sure I should say this, but I can't recall the 2 middle sequels, both starring Tony Todd reprising his role. I know I saw #2, can't remember if I saw #3. But, my guess: they were far better than this mess. So, since my memory's fuzzy, just stick with the original classic and really good 1st movie from 1992.***Final Thoughts: Funny, I love slashers - they're my favorite horror subgenre. But, when this literally added needless and completely unrelated death scenes to the plot to up the kill counts, I didn't just lose interest, it pissed me off with how unoriginal, lazy and sellouts these filmmakers were.Also pissed me off: how the police were written was disgustingly unrealistic. One of them instantaneously because a comically racist cop to be relevant for the events of the last couple of years. And another murder was reported and within a split second, the cops announced the husband of being the main suspect. WHAT? That would never happen in a thousand years.",Candyman
13,FeastMode,ummmmmmm yes please,8,2 September 2021,"I had a great time with this movie. I was invested throughout. My eyes were glued to the screen. I wasn't distracted by the ppl going in an out of the theater or the couple that brought their 8 year old kid. Which if you know me seems impossible. It's cause i was so into the movie.I could immediately tell the directing was top-notch. So many cool and creative shots, some of them were hypnotic. Well-made across the board from a technical perspective. I liked all the performances. The story is pretty good, although a few parts didn't feel as natural as they could have been.As a horror movie, thumbs up all around. Lots of intense scenes, so many done creatively. A bunch of jaw-dropping moments. And the social commentary side was chilling.I feel like jordan peele has created a new horror subgenre. And i'm not talking about the social commentary. Any movie from any genre can have social commentary. But the feel and style of these movies is different. They can't be categorized in any of the horror subgenres i can think of.

14,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Affectionate, ambitious if imperfect reboot",7,8 September 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1977, in the projects of Cabrini Green, Sherman Fields (Michael Hargrove), a local man with a hook for a hand, becomes known as the 'Candyman' because of his fondness for handing out sweets to local kids. However, when some of the sweets are found to contain poison, he finds himself battered to death by the police when they close in on him. Forty two years later, Anthony McCoy (Yalha Abdul-Mateen), an artist, looking for inspiration, crosses paths with William (Colman Domingo), a local man who fills him in on the legend of the Candyman. After a bee sting, Anthony is plunged in to the legend and toward his destiny when a series of murders start.It's a depressing feeling, when you start to realise how old you're getting when remakes of films are coming out and you can remember the (however vaguely) when the original came out. And so Nia Da Costa's update of the original Candyman arrives (which has made her the most successful female director of all time, or something.) With the social justice trends that have spread around the world after events such as the George Floyd killing, it's certainly a very timely and relevant piece, eager to shine a light on current topics, such as police brutality towards the black community and broader issues in wider society.Da Costa obviously has a deep affection and love of the original film, from her depiction of a modern, gentrified Cabrini Green as opposed to the deprivation in the '92 version, through to the inclusion of original cast member Vanessa Williams in the revelatory scene of the story, as well as references to Helen Lyle from the original film when recounting the CM folklore. Although not the central crux of the story, she is careful to include the original 1800's source of the Candyman legend, and while it doesn't fit in altogether neatly with the core story, it's presence definitely elevates it.The story doesn't come altogether all as well as the original did, and it's a lot more sensitive and restrained with the blood and gore (resulting in a 15 certificate of all things!) But it's still that rare of things, an inspired remake, with some relevant social commentary to make. It's made by a director with a love and affection of the original, rather than a cheap cash in, and that can only be a good thing. ***",Candyman

17,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Carefully prepared good sequel,7,24 October 2021,"First of all, I loved the movie. Acting was good. He was good in the script. The ending was a bit quick, but I liked the ending too. Actually, it was a better movie than I expected. Carefully prepared. The movie is a good sequel. There was only one thing I didn't like in the movie, the police scene at the end. It's obvious why this scene was shot. I don't think it was necessary, or it could have been drawn in another way, but it was drawn like revenge. This is my personal opinion, it was not necessary. In general, congratulations to everyone, the movie turned out to be very good.7/10.PS : There was no jumpscare, congratulations and thank you.",Candyman

Candyman is everything I'd want it to be even with 4 hours of sleep. The cast is perfect, cinematography is one of the best aspects, scenery is beautiful, and the writing is great! I don't understand one guy in the audience that didn't use the recliner at all and wore his mask throughout that's just weird I'd much rather be comfortable. The way everything played out is so good I wouldn't want anything else and very grotesque.Damn this got a lot of downvotes probably for a bad reason it's a great movie though!",Candyman
19,Thanos_Alfie,Do not say it...,6,22 October 2021,"""Candyman"" is a Thriller - Horror movie and the sequel of ""Cnadyman"" of 1992, in which we watch an artist moving into an apartment with his girlfriend in Cabrini. They find out about the story of the area and the legend and the history behind Candyman.I enjoyed this movie and since I had already watched the first movie, I had high expectations from this one and I was not disappointed at all. The story was very interesting, it connected very well with the first movie and also the history behind Candyman was presented in a very good way that was easily understandable. The direction which was made by Nia DaCosta was good and she did an excellent job on how she connected the previous movie and the past with the present day. The interpretations of Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who played as Anthony McCoy, Teyonah Parris who played as Brianna Cartwright and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett who played as Troy Cartwright were very good and their combination worked well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Candyman"" is a nice, interesting movie that you will enjoy it even if you have already watched the first movie so, I recommend you to watch it.",Candyman

24,southdavid,I was hooked.,8,1 September 2021,"It's been an awfully long time since I've seen the original ""Candyman"" film, long enough that I might as well have come to this sequel/reboot having never seen it. So on it's own merit, I'm happy to say that I loved it. It had some truly memorable moments and a sad, socially conscious, plot, without ever feeling weighted down by it.Having moved to the now gentrified area of Cabrini in Chicago, Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is struggling to find the muse for his art. He heads to the last remaining area of what was the Projects, and meets William Burke (Colman Domingo) who tells him a story from his childhood about an innocent man who was murdered by the police, but who haunts the city, killing anyone brave or foolish enough to say his name five times into a mirror. Using the story as inspiration, McCoy creates an installation for his girlfriend, Brianna Carthwright's (Teyonah Parris) gallery, one that dares people to call on the urban legend.If I can get the one criticism out of the way early, I don't think that the film is particularly scary. There are some unsettling moments, there are some gory moments, but if you come to this, which is ostensibly a horror film, looking for terror, I don't think it's going to get you there.What it is, is beautifully realised. From the reversed studio logos, all the way through to the amazing end credits it's a great film to look at. It's most memorable moment, for me, was the death of an art critic, which was wonderfully shot. I like the way the film tied back into the original story, but also opened up the mythology of the Candyman character a bit.I'll accept the criticism that the ending is abrupt, but I'm not sure how else the film could have concluded and I really thought overall the film was one of the best of the year so far.",Candyman

I remember being completely bored by it. It wasn't scary then, and it certainly isn't scary now. A good test would be to go to the mirror after seeing this and say ""Candyman"" five times over. If it's easy to do then the movie has not done its job.It felt like this version of 'Candyman' was so intent on giving a political message that it forgot to be an enjoyable film along the way. It's ridiculously preachy and self-righteous. It's not ever what I want out of a horror movie (or any film for that matter).The characters are extremely bland, the scares are more or less non-existent, the concept is stupid and the film refuses to get off its high-horse.

It is produced and co_written by Jordan Peele and takes place in the same Chicago neighborhood as the original. Yahya is an up and coming artist that finds inspiration for his paintings in the old urban legend of Candyman. Colman is the source of his information after Yahya meets him in a laundromat. Colman is very knowledgeable in the history and also knows more than he is letting on. Teyonah is Yahya's live in girlfriend and Vanessa is Yahya's estranged mother-he doesn't talk to her much-that has secrets of her own. You learn about the origin of Candyman and there are 3 people from the original movie that show up-one is only by voice. Oh yeah, the opening studio credits-Universal, MGM, Monkey Paw, etc-are all reversed. I thought the projectionist had messed up at first and there is a stick figure puppet show going on during the end credits-like the ones seen in the trailer.It's rated ""R"" for bloody horror violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Candyman

28,kevin_robbins,One of the few masterpieces added to the genre this year,10,29 August 2021,"Candyman (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theaters as soon as it was released. The storyline follows an artist in Chicago that lives on a high rise built on top of the original projects where the famed Candyman story once originated. He continues to dig into the details of the Candyman in hopes of it inspiring his artwork and success from it. The deeper he digs the more murders start happening all
over the city that appear tied to the legend. This movie is directed by Nia DaCosta (Little Woods) and stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Aquaman), Teyonah Parris (Chi-raq), Colman Domingo (Selma) and Vanessa Williams (Candyman). The storyline for this picture has a surprising amount of depth and broadens the Candyman story and premise beyond what we've seen historically while still staying true to the first film. This does building upon the original as a true sequel. I loved the attire, settings, unpredictability and evolution of the characters and story. There's also so much depth in this around social perceptions. The casting is very good and the horror elements start slow and build in intensity with each kill. It takes no time to start rooting for both the good guys and villain in this. One of the few masterpieces added to the genre this year and an easy 10/10 for me.

29,robfollower,Candyman (2021),7,10 September 2021,"Jordan Peele's reboot of the (Definitive 1992 movie starring Virginia Madsen , Tony Todd and Vanessa Williams ) is a social commentary about the criminal justice system, racism and gentrification. The more the plot reveals about the origin of the Candyman, the more its frights lessen. The racial justice theme is to heavy handed. ""Candyman"" is a racial justice movie. The connections to today's happenings are not bad but producers appear more adamant about its social justice themes than a campaign to scare their audiences. The racial theme is important to the original legend of Candyman and the origin of the myth and his Legend as Candyman as he once was a human being name Daniel Robitite . Cowriter Jordan Peele just perseverates on the racial aspects of the myth rehashes the thought, after the stimulus that prompted it has ceased. It was a bit much.Here is my conundrum or better my contradiction . Even as I would have preferred a lighter take with the writing regarding the social commentary -- the film-making was first rate. Smart film-making from the director Nia DaCosta. He has obvious knack for the horror genre for Candyman is savvy with haunting imagery through old-fashioned shadow puppets, eye-popping gore , and thought-provoking cinematography .This is a film that I will enjoy the second viewing more as I have come to terms of social commentary that Jordan Peele was trying to convey .The racially charged reasoning for the antagonist for his being now, many decades beyond his death. The balance of Peele's clearly frustrated feelings could have been more evenly balanced in this horror movie . Peele is still extremely talented writer . I have put my big-boy pants on and do appreciate his work . I have a strong affinity for ""The Forbidden"" by Clive Barker and director Bernard Rose original 1992 definitive version of Candyman that it took a while to come around to Pelee's vision and it is a strong horror film in its our rite .The cast give fine performances, with Abdul-Mateen standing out in an often difficult role, he is superb here. Candyman does unleash the gory carnage. And even with the politically charged ending the climax works extremely well .",Candyman
30,alindsay-al,An Average Let Down,5,13 September 2021,"Yes, I am a bit late to watch this film but today I found the time to watch Candyman today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the return of the dreaded Candyman as he returns to where the franchise began.Main Character
Yahya Adul-Manteen plays the lead character and I thought he did a good job in the role. There are certain issues with his character and well the majority of characters but I actually am going to give him the benefit of the doubt as I think he really gave it his all and tried to make his character interesting and certain elements of the film let him down, as when it comes down to it for me he is the best part of the film.Supporting Characters
Teyonah Parris plays his girlfriend and I liked her in the role too. They work well together and she again tries to provide something to latch onto when it comes to her character, between this performance and her future in The Marvel Cinematic Universe as Monica Rambeau things are looking good. I really like Colmon Domingo as an actor and he is good in this film, I mean he is basically the character who dumps exposition but he does it well and his presence is very effective in the film. But there were a few characters who annoyed me, mainly Nathan Stewart Jarrett, he is just way too much here and I get that he is meant to be the comic relief but he is just not funny and took me out of the film as it kind of felt like he was acting in a different film to everybody else.Story
An important thing to mention here is that you don't need to watch any of the other Candyman films to understand what is going on. I know this because, I have never watched a Candyman film and I understood the story clearly. Now there are some things I liked, mainly just how accessible the films plot was for somebody who isn't a huge fan of the lore, I found most of it interesting. Though there are some clear issues, there is a clear pushing of social commentary in this film and that is fine but they beat it over your head and after hearing it so many times it becomes hard to really care. There is also a rushed feeling to it all and the final act goes against what most of the story has told us and it basically becomes a generic horror with little depth.Script
The script is the one element that really holds this film back, it is just not good. The film never hits the dramatic level that it should, there are some good ideas here but they are executed so poorly that it doesn't really matter. The humour is thrown in with little success and it just feels like this needed a screenwriter of the top level to deliver a better script which could fix certain other elements of the film.Style
The film looks fantastic, the cinematography is beautiful and I really liked some of the techniques that were used to show off Candyman in some of his glory. But the pacing of the film is all over the place, to put it politely it's a bit boring, it takes so long to get going that it just takes you out of caring about the film. Also I am not one for loads of gore, but this film had to show more violence instead of hiding it, it builds and builds but doesn't feel like it does enough in that regard.Overall
Overall, Candyman is an average film that does disappoint as the natural sequel to the original film. Unless you are a big fan of the original then you can leave this film and watch other horror films as we get closer to Halloween.",Candyman

33,kluseba,Lame remake with forced social statements,3,17 September 2021,"Candyman is horror movie remake with forced social commentary that bores from start to finish.First of all, the plot line isn't particularly intriguing. The story is very predictable, the minor twists and turns are unconvincing and there is a surprising lack of atmospheric and scary passages.The acting performances remain unconvincing as well. Lead actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is lacking charisma and doesn't manage to make viewers empathize with his character at all.The forced social commentary is getting more absurd as the movie progresses. The movie tries to be on the pulse of time but feels stiff, stereotypical and conservative in its desperate attempt to appeal to contemporary woke culture. The idea that Candyman eventually becomes a superhero that fights police violence and corruption is certainly bold but completely unfitting with everything that entity has done before in the movie.At the end of the day, one might give the film a few points for walking off the beaten path with its social commentary but that sociopolitical component makes the film tough to digest. As a horror movie, this film isn't even remotely scary and very few scenes manage to evoke tense atmosphere. I like many works of screenplay writer Jordan Peele such as Get Out and Us but Candyman must be considered a disappointment.",Candyman
34,Pairic,A worthy sequel,8,1 September 2021,"Candyman (2021): Perhaps a tad didactic, Jordan Peale has dealt effectively with the same theme of institutionalised racism in a less doctrinal manner but he's not the director here and the issue is primarily police violence so perhaps the emphasis is warranted. This doesn't take away from Candyman's effectiveness as a horror film, scenes of terror and violence abound as gentrification has swept away the Cabrini-Green towers and replaced them with Art Galleries and luxury apartments. The Candyman returns, first to a gallery, slaying two curators. He can only be seen in mirrors or as a shadow. The slashing of throats and impalings are vividly shot, we see an art critic cut down in a long shot from outside a window. A worthy sequel to the original as we see how the Candyman is reborn anew through another unjust killing every generation, though each is linked back to the original. Some really impressive shadow puppetry in the film itself as well as in the credit sequences. Directed by Nia DaCosta, Written by DaCosta, Jordan Peale and Win Rosenfeld. 8/10.",Candyman

36,masonfisk,A WORTHY SEQUEL...!,8,17 September 2021,"The sequel to the 1992 original currently in theaters. An artist, played Yahya Abdul Mateen II, is going through a bit of a block since he hasn't had any output in release for a bit. Pressure comes from his live-in girlfriend, played by Teyonah Parris, who happens to be an art curator & whose star is in the ascendant so when her brother & his new boyfriend come over for an intimate dinner, the myth of Candyman is brought up during a conversation which details the events of the original film. Mateen is intrigued & decides, w/trusty camera in tow, to visit Candyman's old stomping grounds (the Cabrini Green projects now under the onslaught of gentrification) where he meets a kindly laundromat owner, played by Fear the Walking Dead's Colman Domingo, who as a child met up w/a version of Candyman, a falsely accused man (he allegedly was putting razor blades in pieces of candy & handing them out to children) who becomes a victim from overzealous police officers even though more tainted candy was distributed at the same time of his fatal assault. Intrigued by the yarn, Mateen soon becomes a flurry of activity even getting space in Parris' next show which doesn't go over well w/a snooty critic but Mateen is hooked & the Candyman mythos soon becomes his mode of inspiration (w/an added physical reminder from a recent bee sting whose infection keeps escalating) as the reveal comes as to who he really is in the scheme of the Candyman saga. Co-written & directed by Nia DaCosta (soon to be helming MCU's The Marvels) crafts a muscular follow-up which honors the work done by Bernard Rose's original (based on a Clive Barker story) while also expanding on the racial divide on those who've been here all along & the johnny come lately's who add nothing to the cultural landscape.",Candyman
37,aidanratesmovies,"Tell everyone, Candyman (2021) is a great movie",9,29 August 2021,"Like Blumhouse recent Halloween reboot- Candyman is able to take the working formula from the classic original and turn it into something vibrant and new- altogether the sequel we truly deserved. Initially I was very nervous about this film, not just because I enjoyed the original so much, but also because the two previous Candyman sequels were absolute garbage. Thanks to the great talent involved though with this film, a large amount of fresh ideas, and some stunning visuals- this film was in my opinion even better than the original. It elaborates more on the story told from the first film, while also being incredibly entertaining, sharp, and tense with no time to spare. Its main cons are being a bit too derivative of the original at times, and it's jumping around to other characters can be a bit awkward story wise- but every scene works just how it was intended and I really enjoyed the follow through. The film is expertly crafted through the eyes of director Na DaCosta- who provides a very unique look to the film and a peculiar and incredibly interesting story- along with the help of the iconic Jordan Peele. Yahya Abdul-Mateen is by far the best actor in the film and allows us to deeply empathize with his character, his inner struggle, and his demons within. In the end, Candyman is not flawless- but it is truly how a reboot should be done, and quite honestly one of the best reboots to be made so far. It may not be the most original, but it is incredibly unique, and you'll be bound to think about it long after the credits roll.My Rating: 9/10.",Candyman

39,rgkarim,"Candyman Has a Sweet Opening, But The Razor's Cut The Finale Off Roughly",6,27 August 2021,"LIKES:The Creepy Atmosphere:
Candyman's latest installment shows a gentrified Chicago hood that holds the modern splendor of modernization, built over the ruins of the past in an attempt to bury the culture that might be less attractive. In these ruins is where the legend starts to rise again and the fact this ""curse"" spreads into the wealthier districts is the true horror of the movie. Candyman uses a brilliant amount of non-special effects to set the stage, a blend of subtle light changing filters, use of ear splitting violins, and the sound mixing of other elemental pieces that suggest the doom that is about to take place. That atmosphere sort of lying beneath the surface of calm is definitely something that makes this movie have a little more nontraditional bite.The Acting:
Again no award winning roles in the terms of Oscars, but don't knock Candyman's performances until you give them a shot. The lead is done extraordinarily well by Abdul-Mateen II, as he takes on the transformational role of the aspiring artist looking for inspiration. Like many great tales, his journey is not linear, and seeing the changing mindscape and what was demanded of him was awesome to see brought to the levels that were balanced between overdramatic horror we expect and a realistic portrayal of horror. Teyonah Parris gets a nod for her performance in the manner of someone watching the legend unfold from her dynamic. The rational role was quite well and I had just wished for a little more integration. Nathan Stewart-Jarett was okay for me, the comedic relief role that is there to try accomplish reducing the tension at times, while also a potential set up, but he needed more time and development instead of the token role he did. Everyone else did a fine job with the roles handed to them, but as they were not the fully integrated components, can't spend too much time calling out other performances.The First few acts:
Candyman's biggest surprise comes in the form of the story that they actually focused om in this time vs. Just the horror/slasher aspects that other franchises try to accomplish. The importance of the lore is heavily emphasized, and piece by piece starts to build up the characters trapped in the Candyman's tale, all while integrating a few kills into the mix. Elements of traumatic back story, relationships that may be tested by the pressure of the Candyman's tale, and lots of things to address if possible. It was this element that really had me ingrained into the story to see what would emerge when the monster came for them.The Shadow puppets:
I loved the storytelling of the legends through the use of shadow puppets as seen in the Japanese art of storytelling. In addition to being unique, the impressive display of art goes with the theme of artistic display in this movie, and also be kind of creepy at the same time. The end credits will show you more of the origins of Candyman at the end, and I really liked that element instead of another live action tale that they could have done.The Makeup:
Several of the injuries and changes to characters in this movie involve some impressive alterations to anatomy. Sure CGI fills in some of the work, but the makeup and prosthetics for this movie are super impressive in terms of execution. Great blending, diverse textures, and levels of impressive growth are to the point to match levels seen in the Walking Dead. While not the biggest seller for many, I have to give props for the amazing work they did in the characters who appeared on screen.DISLIKES:Not Scary:
Part of this is going to be due to my desensitization to violence and horror that I've developed from my time as reviewing. Candyman's atmosphere is the creepiest element at times, that sense of being alone and having to deal with the pressures that life and supernatural can throw at us. Yet, the movie sort of adds that Peele twist to the film and begins losing the scare factor for more of that cheaper thrills that he sometimes brings. I'd have liked a little more suspense and execution into the element of Candyman's hunts, but that did not seem to be the focus of this feature.Political:
If the legends are indeed built upon what a character says, I supposed I should not have been surprised. However, Candyman's modernization holds a lot of political undertones and agendas that you will either appreciate or be annoyed with. While not the worst thing to happen in a movie, there are times when that focus gets a little stale for me and starts to throw off the horror element for me. When you see who the victims are, who gets passed by, and especially the ending, it suddenly starts to show a different face that kind of threw off the story for me. And when the kills start to become cheap bouts that happen in the background... it only further shaves off the thrills you were hoping to see.The Story Element in the third act:
My buddy and I both agree that the first acts engage and show promise, but it's the final act where the baton is dropped and the race sort of comes to a quick end. Candyman's twist is crammed in at what feels like a last minute surprise, taking all that build up and sort of dousing the fire too quickly for my tastes. Other characters also show signs of some interesting background stories, especially the female lead who held a lot of trauma in her story and yet we barely got any of that. All the other characters with names held potential to be integrated into the tale, but alas, they seemed to have run out of time and needed more politics vs. Execution of their story.The Rushed Pace At the End:
Sadly, the other elements also suffer at the end, all the horror elements again compressed into a 20 minute finale that feels sort of disrespectful to the work they put in at the movie. The hunt becomes sort of off camera focus, the impasse is rather laughable in how easy it is solved, and the political component being the primary focus. It feels very much like Peele's writing, only without the finesse that he did in Get Out and Us. Thus, this finale may have some moments that will have some happy, but for me it was a bit of a letdown given the potential that was hinted at the early parts of the film.The VERDICT:
Candyman turned out to be better than I anticipated at many parts given the trailers and modern take on cinema. The first few parts of the tale show promise, a fantastic display of artistic decisions to build up the potential and hint at some deeper levels of horror lore the film has needed. Great acting, alongside tributes to lore with other elements keep the tale interesting, with enough horror moments mixed in to snack on in the midst. Alongside the great makeup and use of a style not seen, there were some great things to celebrate in this film. However, it's the final act where the movie crashes down, and the rushed finale does little to drive that full punch that I think they wanted. A laughable impasse, dropping the story and other characters, and so many other elements are minimized in order to just put something out there and wrap things up. Candyman almost could have used another thirty minutes or maybe a second act to keep the promise going and that was disappointing to me. As such, I think this movie is best left to a home viewing or with a group than alone.My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5.",Candyman
40,vengeance20,"Not As Bad, But Still Not As Good!",5,27 August 2021,"Have seen all 3 of the Candyman Films with the one & only Tony Todd & thought they were all good film despite the repetitive story telling in the 2 sequels that followed the 1993 classic. Nonetheless, this film wasn't as bad as I thought it was, but it wasn't as good & to be honest I prepared myself for that.The film is supposedly a sequel to the 1993 Candyman Film & continues the legend of the man himself, this time with a different sort of story.I found the film to be alright, not great & nowhere near as good as the 1993 classic which craps all over this by miles. What didn't help was the snipes, dialogue & undertones regarding race. I felt they were unnecessary & completely unneeded, the original handled the issues better & wasn't nearly as bad. I was, however, expecting the film to be full on in that area but surprisingly wasn't. There were a couple of conveniences in terms of plot & what I mentioned above, the portrayal of the characters etc.The film was bloody & the body count was decent, but the deaths were tame in execution, given they could've shown much more. The story was alright but dull & convenient for what the films message was supposed to imply & mean.

43,Pumpkin_Man,A Sweet Treat For All Fans of Horror!!!,10,28 August 2021,"I've never really been a big fan of the Candyman movies. It had probably been at least 20 years since I last watched the original, or its sequels. I decided to re-watch the original because I heard this one was a spiritual sequel to the original, similar to what Halloween 2018 was. I'm sorry, but I think the original Candyman movie is overrated. There were hardly any kills, and the woman is boring. We're just following her around, and every once in awhile, Candyman shows up. Farewell to the Flesh was better.Now, let's talk about the reboot. I really enjoyed it, but it's not too scary. Candyman 2021 has a little bit of everything; slasher, suspense, slow burner, body horror, symbolism and social commentary. Jordan Peele did a great job writing the script and expanding on the story, and Nia DaCosta did a great job directing the film. The kills were pretty good and gory! I dare say that I liked this one better than the original. My only gripe is that I wish Tony Todd had more screentime.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Anthony McCoy, who is supposed to be the baby that was taken in the original film. He's all grown up and living his life as a successful painter. While looking for new inspiration, he goes to the Cabrini-Green projects, where he learns about the myth of Candyman. He becomes obsessed with the story and begins painting him, which leads people to saying his name five times in the mirror. Will Anthony be able to stop it, or will the Candyman return to finish what he started?If you love horror, slashers, and social commentary on racism, you'll love CANDYMAN!!!",Candyman
44,gedikreverdi,It would be a great film with more on camera killings,7,18 September 2021,"Everything looked very stylish and the acting was good but it was so different than what I expected to watch. It felt quite disjointed as I had difficulty with following what's going on. It turned out Anthony was the kid that was abducted by Candyman and Helen had saved him from the bonfire. He was stung by a bee in the old neighborhood and started to become the Candyman. His wife was abducted by the man from the laundromat at the laundromat and they were both taken in an abandoned house in the old neighborhood. She managed to kill the man but the police killed Anthony. One of the officers wanted her to lie and she summoned Candyman at the car and he was there killing officers. It looked really good with bees swarming around his head.The killings were in general okay. The best one was the critic lady because we got to see it from outside along with what's happening at the rest of her apartment while she was getting killed by the Candyman at her flat. The school kids getting killed at the school bathroom was disappointing as everything happened off-camera. The curators' killing at the exhibition hall looked really good, too.It wasn't as creepy and scary as the original film. However I liked how Candyman was visible in reflections and that he was not a single person but a concept.",Candyman

The script is pointless and nonsensical.The main characters give a mediocre acting performance the likes of watching a cheap TV show. There is little to none special-effects in this one and it also fails as a psychological horror movie.This one also lacked the atmosphere of a Clive Barker horror film whose movies in the past like Hellraiser, Nightbreed and Lord Of Illusions still have cult followers.I wouldn't recommend this one to seasoned horror fans.",Candyman

49,kjproulx,"A Solid Revamp, but Not Enough Substance",7,14 September 2021,"The lore of Candyman is not something I'm very aware of or have any deep knowledge of. Simply going off what I know from the original property, I was intrigued by the trailers for this new version. After viewing the 2021 version of Candyman, I can confidently say that this is my absolute favourite way for a film to be remade. This is both a remake and a sequel if you really break it down. It continues the legacy of the first film, while also explaining it as if it's just a history lesson throughout this film. When a remake can be different, build on the original, but also feel like its own film, to me that's instantly a win. It also helped that the movie was well-made too. I can't see a broad audience loving this one, but here's why I believe it deserves some attention.Playing as a loose sequel to the 1992 film, Candyman (2021) picks up in modern-day Chicago. Gentrification is a big part of this film and I felt that aspect worked really well. The legend of Candyman is not dead and this film begins with the promise that it's not over yet. I was expecting some kind of generic slasher film, but it goes in a lot of directions I wasn't expecting. On top of being surprising, I also loved the use of mirrors within the cinematography. It all felt very well-crafted and clever. With that said, as much as I enjoyed this movie, something also felt missing.At a very short 90 minutes, the pacing of this film isn't quick enough. There are many instances of slow motion and it almost felt like there was really only about an hour of story to tell here. I loved where the movie ended up and I would gladly watch a continuation, but by the time the film concludes, the overall trajectory of the movie as a whole just felt disappointing. That may sound contradictory, but it's hard to explain it any other way. I personally found the film to be great while watching it, but upon looking back, it feels a little too simple for all the underlying messages throughout. This is one film that I feel could've benefitted from a slightly longer run time.Getting back to the positives; I found the animations to explain the history of this legacy to be very unique. Yes, imagery like this has been used in this way before, but it really worked for the feel of Candyman (2021). Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Anthony was fantastic and Teyonah Parris as Brianna played off his character brilliantly. I thought their dynamic, obviously until everything falls apart, was terrific. The visual storytelling and great characterizations are what sold this movie overall for me, even though I feel like it could've used a little more of everything.In the end, Candyman (2021) won't be looked at as a classic, but I honestly feel that is due to the fact that the screenplay, although well-written, went deep enough. Nia DaCosta's direction here is also superb and his hand in writing, alongside Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld, worked, for the most part. Again, looking back on my experience with this film, it's almost more frustrating than anything else. I can confidently say that I liked it a lot, but I can't help but feel that this was a bare-bones version of a much more interesting story. Overall, Candyman (2021) is a solid sequel/reimagining of the original 1992 feature and if you're a fan of thrillers, I'd say give it a shot.",Candyman
50,kuarinofu,A mess,5,19 September 2021,"'Candyman' 2021 is a mess on every level included in the film.It's a tonal mess, where the supposedly scary parts are mixed with parody-level dialogue (and delivery), satirized or serious social commentary, flamboyantly gay characters played as they walked right of the set of 80s or 90s comedy show and more. This was kind of anticipated after 'Us' 2019 though.It becomes clear that there wasn't enough story for a feature film, hence the short run-time by modern standards.Even with a lacking story and the film constantly pulling away into different themes and tones, there were no characters or character development in the film. There is none, trust me.Acting-wise it was also very reminiscent of 'Us' 2019 since almost everyone was acting like they were trying to do an impression, a parody. I think the initial idea was to make the African-American cast act like rich white people, probably. If not - they were barely believable. The inclusion of the same-sex couple was also more comical for some reason. Again, maybe intentional.All the political stuff was extremely overexaggerated to a point I wasn't sure if they were serious. I laughed at most of the police brutality scenes just because they were delivered this way.To summarize the story, it seems like the Candyman is a passing spirit that protects the hood from white people's police brutality by violently murdering them for being extremely stupid and goofy.I'm planning to see 1992 original, since this one acts more like a sequel, maybe it's better.And yeah, there's also a theme of gentrification but the film abandoned it just like most of the other ones.From a positive standpoint, I did like some of the shots and it was nice to see Tony Todd, even in his CGI state.It is impossible to perceive this as horror since 90% of the murders are obscured behind the scenery. It is also impossible to view this as a mystery film since there is none. And since there were no characters or character development...it's hard to view this as a film altogether.At first, I thought this was going to be a style-over-substance film with all the allegories to the world being upside down, even the music felt like it was playing backward, but in the end, it was just a gimmick, because mirrors, yeah, ok.I'm looking forward to seeing the 1992 film and forgetting about this one as fast as possible. At least it was funny in places.",Candyman
51,Movi3DO,"Again, SAY HIS NAME!",8,5 September 2021,"SAY HIS NAME GODDAMNIT!So I don't know why but for some reason they didn't market this movie as a sequel to the 1992 movie because, THIS IS THE SEQUEL. If you didn't watch the first one, you would still be okay, as this 2021 version gave a TLDR, but you wouldn't get as much impact from the whole story.It took a little bit until the main guy's name was mentioned, and that's for a good reason. It immediately changed the atmosphere of the movie for me, and the horror also picked up from there. I wasn't too surprised since this movie is produced by Jordan Peele himself. Every horror scenes were effective and slowly built the terror of Candyman up on my nerve.This led to the premise itself. Although a sequel, this movie added more to the story with two aspects: one that furthered the lore from the first, while the second steered the purpose of the legend toward a more direct theme about racism. I really loved the former, as it worked very well. The latter, although it was the main focus of the movie, felt forced because it wasn't built up effectively, and was spilled out through an exposition near the end of the movie. I honestly didn't buy the main theme, not that the concept was bad.As for Candyman, while the first one depicted him more of a menacing figure, the sequel made him into a creepy and more supernatural figure. Not only did I have no problem with this, I found it more effective.Overall, a great horror despite a problematic story. 8/10.",Candyman
52,DarthVoorhees,"""Tell everyone""",9,29 August 2021,"Nia DaCosta's 'Candyman' is an expert reimagining of a horror classic. It reminds me of the fact that the horror genre is oftentimes the best lens to look at our cultural angst and trauma. This is especially ironic with the mirror motif but yes 'Candyman' holds up a mirror and the reflection is ugly. I find it amazing that the review bombs are saying that Bernard Rose's original was not 'political'. The hook wielding title character is a manifestation of the themes of race and class in both films. I feel like this picture though is a lot more genuine in that it was made by filmmakers of color and populated with characters of color.'Candyman' does what every good horror film should, build up dread. In truth we do not see much of the titular boogeyman and when we do it is obscured and in the shadows. DaCosta focuses heavily on the idea of the urban legend being passed around. It works and makes the sequel all the more suspenseful. We do not know how and in which way Candyman will appear because every character has their own biases on the legend. Fans of the original fear not. The new 'Candyman' has a deep reverence for it but as the story of those events are retold it becomes distorted. Our lead Anthony McCoy, the kidnapped child from the original film, is played by. Yahya Abdul-Mateem II. He makes the same mistake Virgina Madsen's character made in the original and asks the question ""is Candyman real?"" The brilliant Tony Todd is not in the film much screen time wise but his spirit hangs over everything.The idea to explore Cabrini Green again after the housing projects came down was the perfect approach to this material. The original 'Candyman' might have just played into white fears and prejudices through the lens of Helen Lisle. This is why I appreciated the fact that this new 'Candyman' is told from the perspective of a Black man. Anthony McCoy has come a long way and now lives in the gentrified neighborhood. He brings back the 'Candyman' legend to cater to his rich white neoliberal art dealers and critics who are titillated by it. The best performance in the film comes from Colman Domingo as William Burke, a preacher of the myths. Candyman is the legend of the community that brings the victims of white supremacy immortality. Domingo's Burke has the films best moments when he expounds upon everything. The gentrification is the final act of violence on a broader scale. It stamps out the history. Cabrini Green it's self is one of the Candymen.'Candyman' has been lumped into the broader slasher category but I don t think that's appropriate. Both this film and the 1992 original leave you feeling sad above anything else. We know that naive Anthony is on a dark path that will not end will for him. This isn't escapist horror fun. 'Candyman' is a heavy movie.",Candyman
53,Neptune165,THE MOVIE wasn't scary at all. it was VERY PREDICTABLE,4,7 October 2021,"I thought the movie was pretty disappointing and I was SO excited to see it. I think that the actual concept of the movie was really great, but executed so so poorly. However, if you like to watch movies that have strong plots with sensible endings, this is not the one for you. The characters have back stories that are complex, but they are so glossed over that it is really hard to connect with any of them. The main plot point of the movie was so obvious and really done very poorly. The ending barely made any sense and didn't feel warranted. The film felt like if a bunch of college film students wanted to pay tribute to Candyman and made a bunch of short clips that were strung together into this movie (obviously the quality was better than that I am just talking about how the story unfolds). Also, although the social commentary is definitely important, it was done in a way that was very in your face, which for a movie that Jordan Peele was involved in was very disappointing since we have seen how subtlety and gracefully he has handled other social issues in past films. The movie didn't give you room to really contemplate on the issues, it just showed you what the issues were and kept reiterating them. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are looking for a strong, plot oriented film. I know that people like to see movies for different reasons, so if you are a big fan of Candyman or like the horror elements of horror films more than plots or characters than this one is for you.",Candyman
54,msbreviews,"Technically and visually, it's truly one of the most interesting movies of the year. Sadly, it isn't able to transmit the same quality to the story and its characters.",5,1 September 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""I rewatched the 1992's Candyman in preparation for Nia DaCosta's (Little Woods) direct sequel, so I could get the most out of it without having to force my memory to kick in. Despite being addicted to Philip Glass' score of the original film, Bernard Rose's take on Clive Barker's short story isn't exactly one of my favorite classics, even though I appreciate it quite a bit. Expectations-wise, I didn't know the director beforehand, but I was curious to see what DaCosta could bring to the famous tale.Unfortunately, I'm not the right person to tackle the heavy themes depicted in the filmmaker's sophomore flick. From an evident, strong opinion about gentrification to the biased white critical lenses, the director has a clear vision and firm messages concerning cultural injustice. As a white European young man, I'm not going to pretend to have experience or even enough knowledge to approach these necessary, sensitive debates, so I'll let other critics, namely Black authors, spread their voices.Nevertheless, I have mixed feelings about this sequel. Despite being beautifully shot (John Guleserian), edited (Catrin Hedström), and scored (Robert A. A. Lowe), the thematically driven screenplay often feels forced and occasionally preachy. Characters are thinly developed through an uncommonly too short runtime. The never-ending silhouette recaps of the previous movie are unnecessary, and weirdly enough, a major revelation of this sequel is partially ruined by simply (re)watching the original film. The extreme gore is still present, though slightly toned down, at least from my perspective.Technically and visually, it's truly one of the most interesting movies of the year. Sadly, it isn't able to transmit the same quality to the two pillars of filmmaking - story and characters.""Rating: C.",Candyman

56,SoumikBanerjee25,This is one of those films that deliberately craves for Controversies.,6,25 September 2021,"Right off the bat, let me make this clear; I haven't seen the classic (Which goes by the same title), and I don't even know if it's a continuation or not so it would be better If I refrain from doing any kind of comparison here.And one more thing, my verdict on this film is solely subjective. Therefore, if anything I say hurts the feelings of anybody here in one way or another, I wholeheartedly apologize. I meant no disrespect!Well then, without further ado; let's get started.I have been hearing a lot (More or less unfavorable feedbacks) about Candyman for a few weeks now. And I was just wondering what's all this fuss about? Generally, I avoid browsing through other people's reviews before watching a film by myself; just to keep myself away from any presumptive position.Now, following my own viewing session, I get it. This is one of those films that deliberately spark controversies. Having said that, To be honest, I don't get all this animosity. I know, it's highly political, perhaps a bit bias as well but the core statement it tries to communicate is rather important. Which mustn't be overlooked at any cost.Even if we scrutinize the whole story from a horror standpoint alone; it's a fine showing. What a great piece of Cinematography and I'm not exaggerating when I say, I witnessed some of the most creative Camera Works in there! It is stupendous to say the very least. Sound is another area, that had been formulated with delicate detailing and utmost sustenance.Although I do have qualms about the performances and the all around characterization for that matter. It's not like they are bad or anything but the standard set by Jordan Peele's earlier productions spoiled me for good; it's definitely no match in front of them.My biggest complaint however isn't associated with the Narrative or the presentation; it's about the ignorant mentality, Intentional or not! My only question is; when you as a director/producer/writer are articulating a sensitive yet responsible subject such as Racial Discrimination; you do have a certain obligation (and I mean a big one) to converse on behalf of every community, not just one.All the oppression, the countless sufferings, boundless crimes on people of color; And believe me, I do feel for every individual who has had undergone such unspeakable times.I despise Racism. 'Race' is a Man-made concept. Initially, it was to differentiate through Geographical ancestry, but through the years it has slowly become nothing but a tool for intimidation and inhumane practices.But it's not 'only' targeted towards a particular section of our society. Unfortunately, every minority had endured a portion of it. No offense, but we should not single out one section of the crowd and blatantly exclude the others.No one is immune to the disease of 'Racism', anyone could be prey. It doesn't necessarily correlate to a single faction of people. Sadly, it applies to everybody.Thus, in my personal opinion; Everyone should stand up against Racial Crimes, stand side by side with the victim, irrespective of his/her color of skin or the specific community he/she belongs to. And for the sake of humanity, don't politicize any of it. Cause, Politics might have solved some matters in the past but more often than not it invoked newer ones in the process.""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."" - Nelson Mandela.",Candyman

58,CANpatbuck3664,"An Arty and Interesting Slasher, Direction and Acting are the Highlights",7,5 September 2021,"Candyman resets your expectations as soon as the movie begins, the production credits are presented backward and the opening credits are overlayed on shots of the skyscrapers filmed from the ground on a cloudy day. This kind of treatment continues throughout, I have to credit director Nia DaCosta, this movie has tons of artistic flourish, she really knows how to build tension and present even the most violent of acts with a lot of flair. She helps capture your attention even when the movie going through its more contemplative moments.The original Candyman is still celebrated by critics and fans alike today and one of the reasons it remains relevant is that it had its eye on racial tension and wasn't afraid to comment on it. I haven't seen the original but this version of Candyman isn't subtle and has plenty so say about racial issues and gentrification. A lot of these scenes are filmed through paper doll puppet shows (they're very well done, they're unsettling and provide them movie with depth and remind you of the horror) and I was glad they chose to do it that way. As much as it comes across as heavy handed, the message they're delivering isn't wrong. I don't understand why people are shocked about its inclusion, its spelled out in the trailers and the original movie is famous for its opinion on it. I'd compare it to the Purge franchise, it wears its political stance proudly and if you disagree, I don't know if Candyman is going to be for you.I had seen many members of the cast in other projects but not usually in starring roles. I'd seen Yahya Abdul-Mateen previously in Aquaman and in the Trial of the Chicago Seven, there's a lot of energy in his performance and he's intimidating when the movie gets more serious. I had a hard time buying the transformation of Anthony but that wasn't due to his acting, it was the turn in the script (more on that later). I was really impressed with Teyonah Parris as Brianna Cartwright, she was the standout member of the cast and she nailed the whole emotional gauntlet in his performance. Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Colman Domingo were also good (more notes on Colman's character later) but I also want to mention Vanessa Williams who reprises her role from the first movie. She's great in limited time, she helps get her character's tragedy across and she could have passed for Anthony's sister instead of his mother.Candyman has a lot of strengths but it also a few weaknesses that I feel inclined to share. As I mentioned, this is arthouse horror (sharing more in common with something like A24 instead of Friday the 13th) so there's an emphasis on tension building and atmosphere instead of a super high body count. There are a few moments where you're tapping your foot and wondering when the show is going to get going again. I also questioned a couple of character motivation turns. Anthony becomes obsessed with Candyman very quickly, to the point I was wondering why the people in his life weren't paying attention more to his change in behaviour or his growing infection developing on his body. I also was a little puzzled on why William Burke does what he does at the end of the movie, it seemed so out of left field and contrary to how his character was behaving earlier in the film, it undercuts the climactic finale a little.Candyman updates the story for a new generation and brings the required chills and thrills you want from a horror/thriller. I enjoyed the movie but it did end up in the same kind of rating ballpark as Get Out and Us did. Its a solid movie that gets the job done but it didn't hit that next level for me. I'd still recommend it and it made me want to go check out the original.",Candyman
59,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,30 October 2021,"The stage curtains open ...""Candyman"" (2021) is very different from the original 1992 film, which I expected it to be. Having said that though, it was also very different from what I was expecting it to be. There are elements I knew would be present in the movie because, after all, it is about Candyman. But, as I was watching it, I felt myself being subtlely drawn in deeper and deeper until I was completely hooked (excuse the pun).Ignoring the earlier sequels, this film is a direct sequel to the original movie following the events of Cabrini Green. It is now 27 years later, and Cabrini Green is a shell of its former self with all the high rise buildings having been demolished. We follow along as we watch an artist, in search of his masterpiece, cascade down a dark path as he discovers hidden secrets about his life that ties him directly to the villainous devil himself. His duely concerned live-in girlfriend becomes embroiled in the mysterious deaths surrounding him to the point where it drives her nearly over the edge. The story takes us back into Cabrini Green with an ending that was both satisfactory and chilling.This was a very good movie with excellent cinematography. The visuals were pertinent and memorable. I felt the characters were deep and well acted (for the most part). I loved the back story that was integrated into a modern setting. The character arcs were believable and the transformations we witness were fitting.I highly recommend this film at 8 stars out of 10. The original movie will always be my favorite in the series - I am partial to Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen, and it had one of the best horror movie endings ever filmed (in my opinion).

It could have been written better and much more focused on a pivotal theme. But the hate that is recieving by some people forced me to expect a way, way worse movie and it's just an enjoyable one like the original.

It respects almost everything from the original one and I love some of the original cast are in too.Second, the script is quite good and interesting and it's true there are some kind of racial messages, but honestly, when I watch a movie, I don't care. I don't like politics and politicians. I'm over it. So, there's is no offense to me.Third, Acting is more than correct. And the settings are the best. Love to see the Cabrini again.To add, I really enjoyed the ending. Great last scene, even too short for big fans.So, I hope there will be another movie following the new story.

Anxious to maintain his status in the Chicago art world, Anthony begins to explore these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, unknowingly opening a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence that puts him on a collision course with destiny. I've been wrapped up in the beginning of the semester among other things that I've forgotten to write this review, which is surprising considering how much I've been thinking about it ever since I left the theater. Candyman goes beyond a simple story of a urban legend. If you've seen the original, which I did afterwards, you'll know that it's a smart story that has much to say. And speaking of the original, this is more of a sequel than a reboot, which I didn't know going in. The movie knows that a majority probably hasn't seen it or at least for a long time, so it takes a few scenes of exposition to catch us up. I wish that it were more the case like Halloween (2018) where it was given that this is a sequel to the original two. Had this been the case, maybe it wouldn't feel so rushed. There are so many great ideas that are explored, and some are left unfinished making it feel jumbled. Still, I think this is a standout movie.Nia DaCosta has a hauntingly beautiful vision throughout and her voice shines through. From the mind bending visuals to the eerie score (that still keeps Philip Glass' iconic themes in mind), it's a visual and aesthetic feast. What really made me happy was the gore. Instead of sticking to visual effects 100% of the time, and the visual effects used needed some work, they use body horror. The makeup is convincing and cool to look at. One thing that you'll note in the trailer and the movie is the use of (and forgive me for not knowing the actual term) shadow art with paper cutouts. It's very cool to watch. Colman Domingo, Teyonah Parris, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II absorb all the screen time they get and give us committed performances. In particular, Domingo's monologue of the story of Candyman is very good. Being the lead, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gives it his all, I just wish his character were slightly more fleshed out. We see him go through a lot, yet not too much is known. That may be due to the rushed story. What they do is focus on subjects like gentrification, police brutality, and racism. It's a perfect time for the movie to come out. These topics are applied throughout, but sometimes it's a bit jumbled where it doesn't fully work or it's only half explored. A little more commitment to it would've made the movie that much better, but I can also see why some of it would be cut. Not everyone is going to like Candyman for certain reasons I won't get into. I for one enjoyed it and consider it to be one of the best of the decade. I like how this has also brought light to the original movie which still holds up to this day. I'd recommend Candyman to everyone. It's not necessarily as scary as you'd think, but it makes you sit and ponder afterwards. Now that I've used his name five times, I'll leave it at that.",Candyman
64,Draysan-Jennings,More like a sequel,7,18 September 2021,This film is marketed as a reboot but it felt more like a sequel. I don't understand all the brutal reviews and 1 star ratings. They must of been watching Candyman 3. The storyline tied in well and the kill scenes were awesome. Definitely worth checking out.,Candyman
65,dfle3,I would have liked more from Jordan Peele's take on Candyman. 75+/100,8,1 September 2021,"The plot of this film concerns a young black artist, Anthony McCoy (played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who is in a relationship with a successful African American art gallery director, Brianna Cartwright (played by Teyonah Parris ). They live in a gentrified part of Chicago which was once home to poor black people. There are some obvious racial implications with this context. Anthony learns of an urban legend, concerning a black serial killer called ""Candyman"" and he becomes obsessed with this story and creates some new art works on this theme which are part of an exhibition. The urban legend of Candyman goes that if you stand in front of a mirror and say ""Candyman"" five times, you will summon the murderous spirit of Candyman. McCoy's exhibition references this. Soon after, people associated with his exhibition begin being murdered, as do some of the people who attended it. Is Candyman responsible for these grisly murders?Seeing a poster for this film at my local cinema, my initial impulse was to not see it, as I do remember really liking a film of the same name from many years ago, which I probably hired on VHS (I've reviewed that earlier film here), making the assumption that it was a remake which wouldn't be as good as the original. However, a name on the poster rang a bell in my mind: Jordan Peele. Despite not having seen any of Peele's films, I was aware that his films dealt with issues of race and were both critically and commercially successful. So, I thought that I'd see this film, to, hopefully, get a contemporary, race-conscious take on this tale.Watching the film begin, I thought that this was a reboot of the original film but having some months earlier come across, sort of randomly, the term ""soft reboot"" on the tvtropes website, I'd say that that sounds like the term to use for this new film. I say that because later in the film, it references the story in the first film and builds on its mythos.As far as the horror quotient goes, it seems pretty standard as far as mainstream, cinema multiplex films go, with an MA 15+ rating here in Australia. There's not a copious amount of murder scenes but there is a lot of blood and shots of wounds when they are shown. Not for the squeamish, in other words.Maybe mainstream horror films have to work harder to impress me now or scare me. I was conscious of being less interested in the horror aspect to this story than the perspective that Peele would bring to it. Perhaps it took too long for the penny to drop for me but at some point the suggestion in the film to ""say his name"", when it came to Candyman, did bring to mind all the news of the last year or so concerning ""BLM"" (Black Lives Matter). On that front, I feel that the film falls short on what I would have liked it to do, once I formed the opinion that what it was doing wasn't enough for me. For example, earlier this year (31/05/2021) there was a story on NPR, I think, concerning the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre/Black Wall Street massacre, where mobs of white thugs razed a thriving black neighbourhood to the ground, murdering, on some estimates, 300 black Americans (via Wikipedia). This history demonstrates that truth is more horrific than what horror films can conjure. For that reason, America has suppressed/repressed its black history. How much more powerful could a film like ""Candyman"" have been if it referenced countless historic moments like this? Which is to say, I would have appreciated a Quentin Tarantino kind of take on this story, a la his films like ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"" or ""Inglourious basterds"". In any case, it's an open question on how ""say his name"" interacts with the real world and the film's world.Another aspect on the horror genre here was my failure to take seriously the horror premise of this film: saying ""Candyman"" five times in front of a mirror. Reading the end credits I saw that the source material for this urban legend was a short story by white author Clive Barker, called ""The forbidden"". Now, many years ago I encountered another film adaptation of one of his works, called ""Hellraiser"". The scenario in that was just more compelling than that of ""Candyman"". In other words, the world he creates there just seems more logical, as far as why people would do the things that summon these nightmares.Like one of Ridley Scott's sequels to ""Alien"", the people in ""Candyman"" just struck me as being stupid at times. For instance, the art critic's line of questioning at home to her guest. Not sure why she invited that person there, given her questions. It was also really odd that McCoy didn't see a doctor about his hand...or that none of his friends suggested he do so! The visual aesthetic of these scenes reminded me of the remake of ""The fly"". Also, no doubt unfair but are painters usually as buff as McCoy?One thought which occurred to me was the nature of the Candyman killings, as far as who the victims were. That reminded me of the first time watching films that this kind of thinking occurred to me: Freaky. I've also reviewed that film here. After seeing this new Candyman, I just thought that there would have been scope for a more ""What goes around comes around"" kind of interpretation. Then again, the victims of 'Candyman' probably do fit that bill. This film was tracking to score 75/100 (7 out of 10 stars) but I liked the turn it took towards the end, so I added a ""+"" to it, which justifies the bump up to 8 out 10 stars here.The original's sensuality makes a repeat viewing desirable. The 2021 version doesn't have that quality but it does have some irony and humour.Miscellaneous:* McCoy's mother looked too young to be his mother, I thought!* It later occurred to me that the depiction of a gay couple in this film would have been a lot more transgressive if their race was swapped. Perhaps Peele would have felt that that was a bridge too far for a mainstream American audience?",Candyman
66,ethanbresnett,A tad disappointing,6,2 September 2021,"Given the trailers and the involvement of Jordan Peele, you would have thought Candyman would be a multilayered and intense horror. Instead what we got was a pretty run of the mill slasher flick.It has a great cast and gets off to a good start, with a creepy atmosphere which to be fair does run through the entire film. It does also have some solid and timely themes, although these are often far too on the nose. When we do get down to some Candyman gory action it's pretty well done, with inventive camera work and enough blood and gore to satiate your horror appetite.However it just never really felt like it reached its potential in terms of plot and its message. The final act I thought was a little messy and convoluted, and left me rather unsatisfied. I think there was an over reliance on quite clunky exposition too which became a bit of a chore.There's lots of good stuff about Candyman, and at its best it has some outstanding horror set pieces. The only frustration is that this demonstrates how great the film could have been, but these moments were few and far between.A perfectly good horror film, but a little disappointing given the hype.",Candyman
67,PedroPires90,Candyman has a lot to say,8,28 August 2021,"Candyman is a very effective film in how it references the original, while telling us a strong original story. We can notice Jordan Peele's finger in the writing, but it's Nia daCosta who shines in the direction, putting stunning detail into every scene.It has a large component of social commentary, maintains the level of the original and opens its doors to a younger audience. Although I'd like it to have more scares and more space for some characters to breathe, it's a film well recommended for everyone who likes a good slow-burn with a lot to say.",Candyman
68,midnitepantera,Love the Original Candyman and this was a nice tie-in to that story! :D,7,20 September 2021,"Overall I thought this was better than I was expecting it to be. I read the short story in the 80's from Clive Barker, watched the Original movie in the 90's which was pretty true to the short story. But then the other movies sucked. Then all these years later they bring Candyman back to life.I liked how they used art to tie this new story to the old, considering graffiti played a large part of the original. It had gore where it was needed, not overloaded. And the surprise ending was pretty good. I say watch it! :D.And check out this short documentary about the making of the Original Candyman too:

75,jamiedarlow-37510,Just don't say his name five times!,4,28 September 2021,"The film looks gorgeous and is shot pretty perfectly by John Guleserian (About Time, Love Simon) bringing a few shots in particular directed wonderfully by Nia DaCosta that linger in the mind. The sound department have a massive influence on this movie also and I would highly recommend seeing it on the best sound system possible for ultimate creeps; awesome creepy soundscape including the wonderfully spooky score by Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe. The Candyman himself is also pretty entertaining whenever on screen (particularly enjoyable whenever you catch him in the corner of your eye... wait, was that him?!) and gives plenty of gory delights as well as satisfying Easter eggs to keep an eye out for.The main problem with the film, and it's with great sadness to say, is that the writers felt the need to bitterly politicise everything and it feels extremely shoehorned in to the point of it being a massive distraction from the story. It's completely understandable and admirable for filmmakers to get their political viewpoints across and the attempted exploration on the Candyman being born out of violence and exacting his revenge. However, the well-handled subtlety of the original exploring the horrific act of discrimination has been lost and more focus should have been put on the tragic urban mythological aspect that made the original good (and this one comes frustratingly close to achieving!) Also, I felt the storyline became increasingly nonsensical in the last half.Overall, I would still recommend this in cinemas for the audio/visual bliss and just to support your local cinema 😊👍 but it feels like a missed opportunity.",Candyman

director: Nia Da Costa
Starring: Yahya Abdul Mateen the second, Teyonah Parris, Nathan Jarrett, Colman Domingo, Kyle Kaminsky, Vanessa Williams, Brian King, Michael Hargroves.In present day, many years after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, Anthony and his partner move into a loft in the now gentrified Cabrini. A chance encounter with an old-timer exposes Anthony to the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to use these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, he unknowingly opens a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence. I thought Candyman was very good, But I had some issues that bought the film down a bit for me.My first few positives would be the fantastic cinematography, visual style, and soundtrack. As well as the great set up, character background and uncomfortable tone. This film had an incredible visual style and cinematography. This film was so beautifully artistic, and I can't compare it to anything else I have seen. With some amazing tracking shots of the city landscape but everything was upside down. The film paid a lot of detail to its shots, often zooming out of a scene but still allowing the audience to know exactly what's going on. I also thought the use of shadow puppets was a fantastic visual style to use. It was inventive, unique, and was a fascinating way to tell some of the story and was surprisingly frightening in parts. I also thought the soundtrack and the sound design was very good. The jarring and intense soundtrack really elevated a lot of the scenes and made them really fascinating and intense to watch. The sound design for the hook of Candyman and the dropping of bits of candy was excellently used to build tension and was very uncomfortable. The film executed a very frightening and intense tone. With the killing scenes really sticking with me, they were shot beautifully, and the sound design was just insane with the constant use of deep humming and Candyman was Scary. I thought the set up was effective, having Anthony (Yahya Abdul Mateen) struggle with his art career and discovering the mythology of Candyman really set up his character and his obsession with the legend very well. I also really liked the character background they gave to the mythology of Candyman and the different characters experiences with the legend. It had purpose and linked with the characters in the present so it was very well written.My next few positives would be the humour and chemistry between the cast. The fantastic performances. As well as the use of art, slow building of tension and clever characters. The cast had excellent chemistry here. I think Yahya, Teyonnah and Nathan in particular had fantastic natural chemistry with each other, their relationships were fun, and it looks like they worked well together. Nathan Jarrett was great, not only offering refreshing LGBTQ+ representation by being a proper character but also providing some great humour to some scenes, the dialogue was a big help playing against a lot of stereotypes for black or gay characters in horror that worked really well. The performances here were also brilliant. Yahya Abdul, Teyonah Parris and Colman Domingo in particular did fantastic jobs. Their roles were very challenging, but they all stepped up. Their performances were intense, uncomfortable, and powerful. Particularly Yahya who was incredible here, I look forward to seeing his future work. I also really liked that the film really incorporated the art industry into the idea. It was fascinating to see how the art industry worked and seeing different art displays and how it all works with promoting yourself as an artist was a great part of the film which I am glad they added in such detail. I also liked the slow building of tension, the film did a fantastic job at slowly getting darker and more uncomfortable as the film developed, it took its time with its scares and building its atmosphere which for me really paid off. Finally, I also thought the characters were actually clever. In so many horror movies the characters are dumb and just follow every noise they here or they are stereotypical and go down into basements. But in this film the characters felt like humans and thought for themselves, going against genre stereotypes and it was refreshing.I did however have a few issues with the film, particularly with the script. There was a lot of lapses in the logic and underused characters. As well as underdeveloped characters and forced dialogue and themes. I thought that the film had a lot of cases where certain plot points didn't make sense, in particular when Anthony started have his skin change and his behaviour became more erratic, for a long time the characters didn't really do anything and just acted normal, I also would have like to have seen more of Teyonah Parris's character as I thought she could of had a bigger role in terms of developing her relationship with Anthony. Because of this the characters felt underdeveloped. I understood their connections to the Candyman and what career they had but nothing much else, so I could never fully connect with the main characters relationship due to the lack of attention to their characters. My biggest issue was with the forced dialogue and themes. I respect the film for the themes it put across about racism, but I thought the execution of them was bad. The dialogue felt very forced and clunky constantly mentioning all of these things but never really incorporating them into the plot. A lot of the dialogue was so harsh that it almost felt anti-white in parts.My final few positives would be the development to the plot and the plot twists. As well as the use of gore, some good themes, and a great final act. The plot development was excellent, Anthony slowly losing his mind and morphing into Candyman was handled excellently in order to build the tension and it really gave the film some room to breathe and make it a slow and frightening descent into madness. I also thought the plot twists were very strong. Particularly with Anthony and his origins with the Candyman. The twists were dark and gave the plot more depth. I also really liked the use of gore in the death scenes. They really added a lot more impact to them with the large amounts of blood used combining slasher and horror very well. I also appreciate some of the themes the film expressed. Despite me not liking the execution the film raised some important issues on police brutality and gentrification that are linked to a lot of issues still embedded in society, so I still had some form of respect for what they were going for. Finally, the final act for me was very strong. Some people have criticised it. But for me it was intense and frightening and the tension that was being built so well all came together here for a very well-crafted and written final act that concluded the story well.Overall, Candyman is elevated by Nia Da Costa's beautiful and inventive creative vision. And is one of the most stylistic and creative horrors I have seen, with incredible performances. And has some of the best use of tension and sound design I have seen in a horror. But the script was not up to the standard of the creative vision, and the bigger and deeper themes are lost due to the execution.Overall rating 82/100.",Candyman

78,movieman6-413-929510,Candyman in a current modern way for the current generation.,5,29 August 2021,"Candyman is the latest movie from the Candyman film series. Despite this being the fourth Candyman movie, this movie ignores the original part after the subsequent sequels. This film is directed and partly written by Nia DaCosta, the director of Little Woods.The film is set in Chicago where artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) uses the ghost story of the Candyman murders as inspiration for his next art project. Without realizing it, he summons Candyman again, who now poses a threat to anyone who dares to mention his name five times in a mirror. As Anthony tries to make such a successful art project, Candyman's casualties only increase.This Candyman film has been given a modern and current look, to appeal more to the current generation. For fans of the original film, it may take some getting used to, as the mystery aspect of the original film is somewhat lost in this film. When Candyman commits a murder, you get to see this more often as a viewer in this film, where in the original you hear more of the story of a murder in the beginning without knowing who the perpetrator is.Nia DaCosta does portray the film in a beautiful way. She also filmed the movie in the same place where the original movie was filmed. For example, it can be fun for fans to see the same place again and see how it has changed over the years. She knows how to create the right atmosphere.She also conveys the Candyman murders in a creative way by showing how he attacks people from mirrors, but can also only be seen in the mirrors. It's nice to see as a viewer whether you can see Candyman in mirrors before he attacks someone. They have done this with good make-up effects. Unfortunately, they choose not to always portray the murders clearly, which can be a disappointment for slasher fans. Sometimes the story of the film is also overshadowed by the social message of the film. Candyman himself also loses the personality he had in the original movie thanks to Tony Todd's acting. Despite the fact that Tony Todd can be seen in the film, he gets little else to work with and comes across as a standard slasher killer. The rest of the film cast also comes across well and appropriately in the film. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Teyonah Parris come across as the main protagonists in the film, who bring back unwitting Candyman as they go about their careers. Nathan Stewart-Jarrett also provides some entertaining comedy scenes in the film. The rest of the cast are more likely victims of Candyman, but due to a lack of information you as a viewer care little about these characters and it doesn't matter if Candyman gets hold of someone.",Candyman

However, this update to the classic franchise will mainly dissatisfy and disappoint the truthful fans.What audiences appreciated about 1992's Candyman was the psychological eeriness and the clever design. The new Candyman is very creepy and well-crafted, but lacks the amount of suspension and is more political than terrifying. The original was also fearless when it came to depicting gruesome slashings, whereas there's only a few moments of bloody carnage here, with most of the excitement left unrevealed.The suspenseful climax is also surprisingly very hurried, meaning that there's been a lot of changes between the original classic. However, it's mostly fans that'll hate the new design. Others will absolutely love it! It's much creepier, faster and memorable, plus the cast's work is acceptable. Nia DaCosta's role of direction was also very smart. The new Candyman's real energy would rely on a better script and some additional onscreen terror.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Candyman
84,darkreignn,More of a social commentary and less of a horror film,5,31 August 2021,"""Candyman"" is slightly refreshing, as it is a mainstream slasher film, something that is becoming increasingly rare as the bitter clock of time ticks increasingly forward. However, while the film succeeds in bringing the slasher back to the mainstream audience, it fails because it alienates its audience through forced and overt political commentary.Now, it's worth saying that political commentary is not inherently negative; and in fact, when ""Candyman"" started, I was actually enjoying the commentary about the projects, because, when the movie began criticizing this system, I was in agreement. But then, the movie kept going and I started to notice something quite curious: Virtually every victim of the Candyman was white, and a racist.Yes, ""Candyman"" turns the iconic slasher into some modern-day avenger who exclusively hunts down and kills white racists, even if those white ""racists"" are four high school girls who haven't even had an opportunity to truly experience life and find themselves. That's right, this 2021 spiritual successor tries to get you to root for Candyman, even as he is shown slicing and dicing innocent victims, which means this film is less of a horror movie, and more of a revenge fantasy.I'm not against political commentary in my films, but it really helps when said commentary is subtle and organically fits into the plot of the movie it's in. With ""Candyman,"" the commentary is as subtle and nondescript as the detonation of an atomic bomb. Besides what I mentioned above, this movie also takes jabs at police officers with an ending that is both ridiculous and narratively bankrupt. The movie breaks its own rules to beat viewers over the head with a message of police brutality; however, the ""brutality"" depicted is unbelievable and doesn't actually make any sense within the context of what's happening on screen.Okay, I promise my complaining is done now because, besides all of my negatives, ""Candyman"" is a competently looking and sounding film. The directing is legitimately impressive and slick, and the soundtrack works wonders in adding to the tension. Additionally, the acting by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Teyonah Parris was good, and they both ate up the screen when they were on it. The film has some genuinely disgusting body horror that is effective; unfortunately, the film does feel watered down in terms of blood and gore. That said, the movie looks and sounds slick enough that it can, at times, work as an entertaining horror/thriller.At the end of the day, though, ""Candyman"" fails because it chooses political commentary over coherent storytelling. With a borderline enraging ending that throws away the rules the film established solely to make a point about police brutality, director Nia DaCosta attempts to convey to her audience her displeasure for today's political landscape. In doing so, she only managed to alienate a portion of her audience and ruin what could have been a truly masterful horror film.",Candyman

89,brianberta,A clever expansion on the social commentary of the original film.,7,6 September 2021,"Note: This review also contains spoilers for the original Candyman.It has a couple horror clichés here and there and certain elements of the arc of the main protagonist is similar to that of Madsen's character in the original film (an outsider becoming wrapped up in the legend of Candyman and eventually becoming the new Candyman at the end), but thematically speaking, the film feels quite fresh. While the original Candyman explores the social and economic differences between white and black neighborhoods and how the legend of Candyman, a part of African American mythology in the slums, is eventually stolen by Madsen's character and brought to the whiter upper classes after she becomes Candyman, the new Candyman calls attention to the police brutality of minority races. The Candyman in this film acts as a symbol of black oppression, given that he was wrongly accused of a crime and unlawfully killed by the police.Anthony's artwork ""Say My Name"" is a terrific metaphor of this social commentary. If the person viewing his art properly engages with it and looks beyond the mirror, they'll see a history of black oppression, which is what the slip of paper Anthony includes with the art instructs you to do. But of course, everyone misses the point of his art, pays no attention to the intended social commentary of it, and attempts the ritual instead. If they complete the ritual though, Candyman will kill them, perhaps as a punishment for their ignorance.It's no coincidence that almost all of Candyman's victims in the film are white people (I think Candyman kills one black person, which weakens the social commentary a bit, but this is a minor flaw). White people don't face the same injustices that the black people in the film do, so sadly, many of them act indifferent to their struggles. In what is easily the best death scene in the film, five girls attempt the Candyman ritual in a bathroom. Among them, four of them are white and one of them is Asian. After they say Candyman's name three times, the Asian girl leaves the bathroom out of fear, but the remaining four white girls finish the ritual and are all subsequently murdered by Candyman as a result. Meanwhile, a black girl in one of the bathroom stalls who doesn't participate in the ritual is spared.The social commentary extends to more aspects of the film than what I described, but this is the main meat of the film's themes. In short, while the film apes some of the same beats as the original film, it more than makes up for this by bringing other new, interesting ideas to the table.",Candyman
90,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Its a welcome addition to the Candyman franchise,8,13 September 2021,"Im honestly surprised at the amount of negative reviews on here. The film is ""too political""? And yet you claim about how much of a fan of the original you are? Either you're completely blind or just ignorant if you didnt think that film was also a social commentary. So kindly, I think you ignore those super low reviews that are hating on the film for that reason.Now, do I think the film is perfect? No. But I do think the film is quite good and a great way to bring back the legend. I totally didnt mind the idea of Candyman being an amalgamation of tragedies. But I was sorely missing Tony Todd the whole time. Michael Hargrove as this version of Candyman/Sherman wasnt bad per se. But Tony Todd just brought a certain oomph to the role. This seductive, enticing, charismatic quality. He had this presence on screen. I didnt find that there was anything about THIS Candyman that really stood out to me. But to be fair, this was really more of Anthony's story you might say. And to that, I do think Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is very good. He certainly makes Anthony a compelling character. Although I still think he lacks the screen presence that Tony Todd had.Also while the original film was supernatural too, I much preferred how the film would cut away never directly showing us if it was Candyman or Helen responsible. It was a bit odd for me seeing an invisible force pick up people and kill them.But I also did love the stylistic choices that Nia DaCosta did made. I loved the use of the puppets for the backstory. I think it really helped with the folklore vibe. I thought the overall story was great, although I think the third act was maybe a little muddled. I loved Teyonah Parris in this and I especially loved her character. I loved how no nonsense she was but also how real she felt. I was worried that maybe she would end up being like Bernadette (Kasi Lemmons) from the first film. But Im glad she had more to do in this film cause I really liked her inclusion in the film. And I think the film had some very effective scary and gory scenes.Overall I enjoyed the film and I think its a welcome addition to the franchise. I rated the film an 8, but I'd say its probably more like a 7.7 to me.",Candyman
91,anthonyjlangford,This Candy tastes bitter,5,5 October 2021,"I'm over 50 and I've never seen a film so openly racist. Going back decades, if there was a racist character, which was rare, they were always scumbags and received their comeuppance. If there was a film about a racist incident, like Mississippi Burning, the filmmakers showed its allegiance to the oppressed. (Including the original Candyman). Here, the filmmakers ARE the oppressors. There's no justification, or even sense, in such obvious racism as depicted here.Just to tackle one of the ridiculous points. That white people created ghettos to oppress black people. Ridiculous. Every city on earth has its poor areas. It's downtrodden. The irony being that the characters in this film are just like the filmmakers, sitting up in their wealthy, snobby ivory towers passing out moral judgements and creating more division with propaganda like this. They don't care about working class people or the underclass. They never do anything for them. It's all surface point scoring to keep their careers going. It's not social commentary either. It's just blatant discrimination.As to the film, my view matches that of others. There is little horror or suspense. After a reasonable set up it's just a slasher film and not a good one. There are some decently staged shots, particularly the opening montage of buildings which was excellent but there's no interest in any of the carnage. No emotion. The director must take much of the blame for such poor staging of these key moments.Even without comparison to the original, this film just does not stand up on its own. It's a good looking film but the characters are pretentious tossers who sit about drinking wine, 'deconstructing' art and dispensing racism. And there's little reason to care about anyone. By the last half hour I couldn't care less. I just wanted Candyman to finish the job quickly so it would be over.By the end of the opening credits, the best part of the film was over.",Candyman
92,AdrenalinDragon,Stick with the Original,5,29 August 2021,"Really disappointed by this new Candyman movie. Most of the film felt like explaining stuff over and over again and recapping the original, as well as way too many sequences of people saying Candyman in a mirror over and over again. Some of the lore/logic is retconned and now Candyman just feels like any typical Slasher villain without the symbolic punch of the original. Some characters are annoying and feel poorly written.There's a bizarre sense of humour that feels out of place and doesn't work in the movie. The deaths aren't all that satisfying. A lot happen off-screen and now Candyman is just killing pretty much anyone nearby. It's just stupid and there's not much good buildup to it. The characters are dumb and the film isn't subtle at all. By the end I was annoyed at how the film doesn't really conclude all that well and felt a little rushed and silly in its execution.Some positives are it's shot pretty nicely and has some visual style to it. There's good uses of mirrors and most of the performances are great. The little animated sequences of retelling the original is a nice touch instead of using flashback footage. The music is serviceable, but mostly just standard Horror music. It tries to tie into the original film, but I'm uncertain if it does a good job on it. Tony Todd is here but very underwhelming. Not scary either.5/10.",Candyman

This is hilarious because both the gallery dealer and critic in the movie point out the danger of being too obvious with the message of a work of art.Of course the film works best when it is being subtle. The bee on the exterminator poster in the laundry room. The history of the Candyman through time. The nods to the original Candyman movie. The shadow puppetry. Even the twists of Tony's background. These all worked perfectly fine without the urban gentrification/injustice hammer to our heads.It also didn't help that all the characters were smarmy, pretentious and mostly unlikable. Pretty weird to say the clichéd brother and his boyfriend were kinda the only bright spot in 90 minutes.It had promise that it squandered with its in-your-face self-importance.",Candyman

98,arabnikita,More ideology than horror,5,8 September 2021,"Candyman (2021)The original Candyman of 1992 holds a special place in the pantheon of horror movies because of it's lore, atmosphere and Tony Todd's performance. Trying to keep the critical hat in my pocket, I went into this film expecting a powerful and stylish follow up with a similar narrative; instead, I ended up watching a 90 minute exhibit of in-your-face ideology. It's almost as if the objective was not to make a horror about Candyman, but to induce numbness with a dragging storyline, weak dialogue, annoying characters and a plethora of political comments.The story centers around Anthony, an painter, who in search of inspiration wanders into an abandoned settlement where a local resident tells him the harrowing tale of Candyman. The legend says that if you say Candyman 5 times in front of the mirror, he will appear to kill you. Anthony decides to make a small exhibit surrounding this legend and naturally, some people decide to summon Candyman and things get bloody. On the surface, it all sounds interesting, but I didn't need to look close to see that it's something quite different and the critic hat came out of my pocket.There is so much originality in terms of style, cinematography and music but at the same time, the movie's writing makes all the beautiful filmmaking feel redundant. When a film inserts a couple of strong messages, it feels thought provoking but when the whole film is simply one non stop ideological ride, it not only removes the enjoyment from the experience, but also makes it hard to connect with the lore. There was so much potential with Yahya's and Colman's acting along with the solid production which sadly resulted in a lecture masquerading as a horror film which brings shame to the name Candyman.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",Candyman

Really?This film is none of these. First if all if you're comparing this to the original you're definitely an idiot. The plot reconnects the folklore and myth with the social context, if you can't understand that the original was a political film then again, you're an idiot.The brutality in this film is inherently woven into the story telling, the art world, the social cleansing disguised as gentrification, the institutional racism, all of this exists in the real world. As the victims line up in front of the mirror they a challenging the monster and quickly realising they are powerless.My only negative comment on this film is that it isn't as brutal and gory as I'd hoped. I wanted a bit more explicit violence to math the implied brutality.If you're going to post a one star review or use the word ""woke"", please don't bother. You're clearly an idiot.",Candyman

Actually the movie was boring, it wasn't intense nor anguished. It wasn't scary at all, because there weren't any jumpscares. In my opinion, it's a movie, that's nice to watch only once.

(Yes I have voted movies a 10 that might not deserve it but by golly I rather rate high then low) Most of the 1 star ratings are more then likely from people who hear the word ""woke"" and are preconditioned to hate something. Now I rated this a 4 in large part because it ruined a great classic with politics.The original and even the badly rated but actually watchable ""Farewell to the Flesh"" was a horror story that melded in with a tragic love story and add some slasher to it. Both stories were entertaining because they made sense. And yes the both did actually have some social issues as well. The Original had the main character explain to her friend that her fancy condo was originally intended to be cheap free housing. And Farewell To The Flesh dealt alot with racism and slavery. But neither had it be a main plot while the love story and family drama was what made it so special.This on the otherhand is all about politics both obvious and not.

In the end we see the first candyman as well.A messed up movie with no beginning and end. With unlikeable characters.Even the murders were mostly absent. The only murder we actually witnessed was the ones of the poor couple in the gallery.The others were mostly off screen. And there was lack of any tension.You know thrillers don't have to be gruesome.

The story was a modern telling of the OG Candyman, a black man wrongfully murdered for falling in love with a white woman, it wasn't a new concept just a concept the outrage generation can't handle.With that being said this is a decent movie worth watching once. It's not really horror, more like a psychological thriller, but despite a great first two acts the third act is sloppy and rushed and confusing at times.

113,fraser-simons,"Cerebral, thrilling, and gorgeous",9,17 September 2021,"Horror, at its very best, aspires, as with any art form, to convey meaning and illicit thought. But the real gem of this film is I think it achieves the jump scare, creeping horror vibes of new horror cinema, as well as being poignant when paralleling the terror of actual events.I'm not sure why people are defensive about the message? It explores gentrification, fetishization, commodification and respects these things in real life, using it as a springboard to try and depict what loss of agency looks like and feels like. Building a myth from that and ties into previous cannon, is really masterful, actually, and elevates it from mere jump scares to something really relevant and interesting.It doesn't hurt that it looks stunning in 4K HDR and the script and dialogue and performances are resoundingly good. The shot composition is exceptional and the sheer creepiness of the stuff done with mirrors is just riveting.I get that some people just wanted to get scared, but this is actually terrifying and will stay with you longer. It shows what horror can and, honestly, should be doing. It's not for the lowest common denominator and some people expected and wanted it to be, apparently. But there's reasonable assumptions to be made about what this movie was going to be, even based on the trailers. If you've seen any of Peele's other work you will know he does not make basic stuff, nor things that will pander to the mainstream. Some may say this panders to marginalized people - but I will say what it actually does is showcase how much better story is when you incorporate a different perspective and choose to respect the intelligence of the viewer.",Candyman
114,BeanieCore,Simply cannot compare.,5,17 September 2021,"The original ""Candyman"" is a beloved cult-classic, and a personal favorite of my own. It's stood the test of time as a truly frightening, creative and intelligent horror film, and it's legacy will remain. This is not the first attempt at a direct sequel to the first film. Two other installments were created in the 90's, both far below the quality of the original itself. I hoped that, in the hands of producer/writer Jordan Peele, this film could rejuvenate the property and bring a horror icon back to his rightful place for a new generation. Sadly, this is yet another mediocre sequel that cannot even come close to the impact of the 1992 film.First and foremost, it was promised that Tony Todd would return to his performance as the titular monster, and he does, but only for a brief few seconds. The rest of the film can be commended for trying something different, rather than re-hashing the past, but it simply does not work. One of the largest problems, is that this film never becomes frightening. Horror films don't always have to be traditionally ""scary"", but this film cannot seem to generate any sense of tension, suspense or atmosphere. It is dark, but never imposing enough. Much of this is due to the editing of the scenes in which Candyman appears. In the original, the filmmakers weren't afraid to show the full brutality of the killings, and Tony Todd's iconic performance was front and center. A truly majestic and imposing character. Here, he is quiet, barely glimpsed in reflections and silhouettes. And each kill is committed off-screen, or just out of view, leaving only pools of blood. After some time, it becomes tiring, knowing that when the Candyman is called, you'll simply be seeing another variation of the same dull scene.But another of the film's greatest problems lies in it's narrative. The original film featured a wonderful sub-text about racism and gentrification, that was brilliantly intertwined with the horror trappings. This one tries to do the same, but fumbles and collapses in on itself. Chief among the issues being that the film runs with the notion of there being multiple ""Candymen"", each one taking the place of another victim of racial violence. Though the concept makes sense, it simply does not work, especially when these new Candymen are compared to the memory of Todd's masterful performance. It's not all bad, however. The direction and cinematography are smooth and efficient, and the cast is really quite good. If only the script had not been quite so unrefined, and allowed itself to be a bit more brutal and intense. As it is, this is just another sadly inadequate footnote in the legacy of a legendary film.",Candyman

Nia DaCosta did an outstanding job with this movie. The cinematography was excellent, such as the experience with the film done with the Candyman. I do like some of the comedy; however, not all of it, for me, sticks the landing. And I do like the message it sends out. I get it, call me an SJW or call me woke. I hate woke just as much as anyone, like the film Black Christmas (2019), but unlike that film (to me anyway) was a perfect example not to get that political for me. Yes, I do understand the same woke thing as always black good and white bad. I get it. But I will judge a film as being A film. And for those who want to rant about what I didn't like, well I'll tell you. The film isn't as violent as I want it to be; with every death, they would cut away and not show it; that is one thing I didn't like about this film; this film didn't feel like a rated R movie. So I am disappointed about that very much. However, overall, the film is solid, and I very much enjoyed this new interpretation of Candyman. For me, it is a 6/10.

122,ha77y73ad97,Was this even a horror film,6,2 September 2021,"From the trailer being released of this movie along with the hype of Jordan Peele slated to co-write this movie I thought this was going to be a genre defining moment of an emotion roller-coaster of thriller elements to detective work. Closer to Seven than anything else, this was far from that.Some of the greatest movies in history are slow burners with multiple story line converging to 1 final point but 4 out of the 6 stories just fell by the way side. The investigative story of who the Candyman is just ended up being the worse pay off! There's no explanation on how the reoccurrences of different deaths impact the rise of the Candyman. The script would rather just tell us what happened, not very well, than us trying to work it out for our selves. Which is a lot of things wrong with writing today, let the viewers work these stories out.I felt the cinema felling what did i just watch. Following the first moments Candyman is remember people get killed but this was just a crazy amount of gore in moments, no build up to the deaths even the way they used the mirrors was terrible, reduced to a fleeting shot of the Candyman hovering thats it! The Suicide Squad had done better with the fight between Peacemaker and Rick Flag for the use of a mirrored surface.Yes this a ""true"" sequel to the original in 1992 and even the ""surprise"" that
Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was the baby from the first film but why did the Candyman want him, was he the father of Anthony? We still dont know the answers to this! Theres no reason for this mantle to be passed on in this way by the end of the movie.This is all down to the writing as the stellar cast did as best that they could with the tools they were gave. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, Nathan Stewart-Jarret and Colman Domingo were great in their delivery of the characters there were some connection to these people from the downfall, to the comedic relief to the unhinged obsessive. The only other positive, that some could see as a negative, was the cinematography of this movie! From the puppets to the artistry of the paintings to the cityscapes this was beautifully put together.Overall this maybe style over substance, maybe someone's favorite horror sequel/ soft reboot but i walked out of this not knowing if i have to see this a second time to understand it or this was one of the worse try's at political, mythological and detective stories.",Candyman

I think it's safe to say that the puppetry is amazing and was a brilliant way to convey plot history without overusing flashbacks.I also felt the performances were really good here; Mateen II really shines, even if some of the dialog is a bit...on the nose. I really like the trend of horror movies finally prioritizing performance, and this film is definitely a showcase for that.In terms of writing, I liked that this is a heavy plot with a lot to unpack. You can't make a Candyman in 2021 and try and keep it apolitical. Even outside of that, I love this movie's subversion of horror tropes and the reality that every POC knows...only white people would be doing the stuff that people do in horror movies. Black people don't need to be summoning s**t.The Bad: That all being said, this movie is lacking in connective plot tissue. We don't really get a sense of the character's relationships with each other (for instance, I don't recall ever seeing Parris and Mateen's characters actually just...being a couple) and some characters are CRIMINALLY underused (Nathan-Jarret's Troy comes to mind). The victims are so minor to the story, there's no emotional impact when anyone is killed.The fact that no one is suspicious when Mateen's character is directly connected to all the murders is a plot failure, plain and simple. I also felt that the dialog was a bit weak at points; the characters sometimes are unrealistically direct (perfect example is the ridiculous exchange at the art gallery).The Ugly: Okay, I saved this for the end...I think given the American political climate, this movie will undoubtedly polarize. Personally, I think the themes of racial injustice, intergenerational trauma and white supremacy are handled quite well, from an emotional POV. It's hard not to FEEL something when you watch this movie. But, there is also a point where the movie compromises on the horror to deliver the cool idea. I just sort of wished it balanced these elements better, like the original '92 version.",Candyman
124,Benslie,Doesn't even feel like a Candyman movie,7,29 August 2021,"This movie is very much a mediocre film but the actors and Nia Dacosta, who directed this, still gave it their all with this project. I'll start by talking about the actors because, despite the script not giving them much to work with, they still gave it their all. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in my opinion was the real stand-out in this movie with his captivating performance. Every moment he's on-screen you can easily tell what he's feeling and going through. Teyonah Parris, who plays Brianna Cartwright, and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, who plays Trent Cartwright, also were really good in this movie. Trent could've easily just been another stereotypical movie character but Nathan Stewart-Jarrett brought so much more to this role making him a really fun-loving character. This was Nia DaCosta's big-time directorial debut and I'm very excited to see what she does next. She brought so much creativity to this movie that even though this movie wasn't really that scary for certain scenes she still made sure the tension was there. Trust me when I saw in order to catch every detail in the background this movie needs a second viewing. Other than that, this movie just didn't work for me. One thing for me was the pacing of this movie and just how it didn't work for this story. There was so much going on in this movie that it didn't feel like a proper Candyman movie until the very end. For a good chunk of this movie, the Candyman storey was just shoved to the side to focus on other things and only came out to the forefront when it was too late. Also, unlike in the original movie where racism was only really subtle hinted at this movie just straight up shows it and makes it known. Overall, Candyman 2021 just didn't feel like a sequel to the original and felt like a completely different movie that just doesn't work.",Candyman
125,tyesonbebee,Not even better then the OG or the Sequels to the OG,3,23 September 2021,This movie wasn't good. It was a lot like the OG where they didn't show candy man a lot. Yeah from the opening scene to the end it's pretty cringe. Hopefully they made it for the cheap cause so far it's been a Flop.,Candyman
126,tbenson97,Definitely Worth The Wait,9,20 September 2021,I finally got a chance to watch this and it didn't disappoint. I was waiting for the iconic theme song to come on throughout the movie and almost lost hope it wouldn't be in it until the credits came on. Bringing back an iconic storyline can either be a hit or miss and while I don't think this was a 100% hit I don't think it was an entire miss either. I was left feeling like something was missing from this story but it was still an enjoyable watch. I liked the cop car scene in the end when you can see all their reflections in the windows as Candyman is walking around the vehicle. I recommend giving this a watch for those considering it.,Candyman
127,darius_sutherland,Not Good,2,25 September 2021,"I'm all for remakes and sequels, if they are good. Of course I'm going to compare them to the original but this lacks so much. The acting is poor and wooden. The dialogue and the way people speak is untrue. The suspense is terrible. The original was creepy, the music, the Todd. I still remember the day I watched it 25 years ago. I'm mixed race and liberal but even I'm getting bored of seeing too many black actors in movies with a left wing agenda hammered home. The message has been heard loud and clear, let's get off the bandwagon and just make engaging movies. The original slowly ramped up the suspense, this one is aaaaaaall over the place. Poor execution.Absolutely wound up by the fact his hand is rotting and he does not decide to see a doctor or that his wife doesn't see it. These things make it seem ridiculous. It's moment after moment of things trying to be weird and scary pieced together.",Candyman
128,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Incoherent and confusing with forced social message,4,19 September 2021,"Candyman, a sequel to the original Candyman from writer-producer Jordan Peele, gets heavy-handed inserting a social message and gets entangled building new horror movie lore, resulting in a confusing and forgetful experience. It is a far step down from Jordan Peele's own-directed Get Out and Us.Anthony McCoy, an ambitious visual artist desperate to boost his career, investigates the Candyman legend in the Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago, re-releasing the evil spirit and unleashing a rampage of death back into the community.Initially learning about Candyman's horror premise, I thought, ""What can the filmmakers do with an evil spirit that is summoned after you say its name in a mirror five times? Wouldn't that gimmick get old quick?""The film begins promisingly, with the opening company logos cleverly reversed, like the audience is looking into a mirror. Writer-director Nia DeCosta takes a long time to set up its story that builds intrigue over atmosphere. It works more like an investigative mystery and has the audience wondering what will happen next, but never concerned with selling its horror premise beyond the surface.All that time is poorly spent. The first scare arrives around the 30-40 minute mark, one-third of the film's runtime. Screenwriters Nia DeCosta, Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfield try to extend the established mythology by infusing a police brutality metaphor that catapults the film into confusion and incoherence in a rushed third act.As a result, Candyman's modus operandi makes no sense. Its once-simple horror gimmick is made even worse. The Candyman spirit seemingly wants people to utter his name to spread his legend, but brutally murders anyone who does so. Shouldn't Candyman spare the people spreading his name and killing people who refuse? Maybe he should take notes from Samara in The Ring.My friend and I walked out of the theater scratching my head, all the time thinking how unfitting the police brutality metaphor was to Candyman. I couldn't believe Jordan Peele had a hand in penning this script and kept checking with my friend to make sure that I didn't miss any crucial details that would have made the story make sense.Yeah, it makes no sense. Save your time.",Candyman
129,alexscott-35299,A good return to the Candyman series!,7,29 August 2021,"Spooky season is almost upon us and candyman was a really good return to it all. I had a blast watching this film and I was just happy to see this series returning with a sequel rather than a reboot. You can really see Jordan Peeles influence on this film as it just has his horror feel with some pretty real and serious topics thrown in aswell. I'm glad that the film didn't have loads of comedy bits in it like Us did as that just didn't work as well, the tone in this film was pretty consistent and it stayed true to itself throughout. The sound design in this film is really good and i like that there isn't always any score/music and it just purely the sound of the film. The special effects makeup in this is really good aswell and same with the CGI, thankfully there wasn't a lot of CGI but when it was in it worked very well. The gore in this was great aswell and I was shocked at how shockingly gorey this film was. I'm so glad Tony Todd returned to play Candyman as he was the best thing about the originals so it was nice to see. All in all I'm so glad that Halloween is almost here and all the horrors are started to flood into cinemas. Great film with hopefully more movies to come into this series!",Candyman
130,hotrobinproductions,What the sequels should have been!,7,27 August 2021,"This movie was very good. Highly recommended. Like a combination of the shinning, slasher and psychological horror. The ending I loved! The progression and way it connects to the previous one without prolonging or being confusing... just a perfect use of what was needed from the previous movie with pretty solid twists. THE ENDING was very nice. I enjoyed and will recommend... there will be sequels!!! I hope so.",Candyman

Hopefully we will have a 4K release and I am so sure it will be awesome as well.PS: I'm so glad I watched the original before watching this. You should do the same!",Candyman
133,HotDoggyBoomBooM,Not scary but gruesome.,6,22 September 2021,At the opening scene gave me the vibes and chills of IT after that it's just typical gore and killings. The movie doesn't hide on who's gonna be the candyman which from the start is predictable and gives you the hint on how its gonna end if you do love horror movies .i felt like they spent too much time on developing the story on each canvas explaining the legend than candyman itself but i dont think the story would have revolved in any other way.,Candyman

136,robinsonaustin-07490,"Good Build Up, Weak Ending",8,4 September 2021,"To start with it is no surprise that the film is better than the two sequels that came out by a margin. With the 2021 film, I honestly really enjoyed it.For starters, wouldn't call the film ""woke"" largely because the first film was also about the gentrification of Cabrini Green. Here, you see the logical conclusion of it. Would seem that some people had forgotten that notion. Is the 2021 film more preachy and less subtle about its message? Sure, but you cannot deny that it is still a relevant one.I did like the first two parts of the film with how they expanded the Candyman mythos, and Anthony's fall into madness is done pretty well. I also loved the cinematography and soundtrack. It may not be as good as the original 1992 film's, but it is still good.Where I felt the film suffered a bit from are the characters. Anthony is an okay character, but certainly a weaker lead than Helen. While his descent into madness is done adequately, I didn't find his relationship with his girlfriend genuine and it lacked depth. Anthony's girlfriend also had potential to be a more fully realized character due to a personal tragedy in her childhood, and you would think that it has relevancy in the story, but it's dropped the moment you learn about it.The third act is where you can really tell that multiple people were writing it, and it felt empty. The first two halves were great because they helped to make the spine of the movie, but it rushed to its end without sticking the landing. The third act also goes into the main villain's evil plan, but it doesn't make sense due to it being a self-contradictory goal and I'd fail to see how it would work.It is also less bloody and gory; while I appreciated the film depicting the kills the way it did because I felt it matched the tone it was going for, that would be disappointing to hardcore horror fans.Overall, if you are able to put your political mindset away and watch the film for what it is on a surface level, you'd probably like it.",Candyman
137,RetroRick,"Not a bad follow up, but slightly disturbing for the wrong reasons",5,30 October 2021,"Mostly a good film. It's not particularly scary & not as good as the first one by any means, but it's effective in its own way.I'm not quite sure I understand the angle chosen. The protagonist is an artist, with an attractive girlfriend, living in a very swanky apartment. The black housing project / ghetto? Where candyman is to be found has from this perspective been left behind. He's made good, or is making good. He has an exhbition for instance & there is some talk about gentrification. He gets angry for some reason, finds himself patronised & at one point rages at someone who appears to be some kind of sponsor. The point here seems to be that despite his elevated circumstances & the opportunities now available to him, the wrongs of the past (or are they still the wrongs of the present) are still very much alive & as it seems alive for him.The treatment of the race aspect of this tale, is I think more heavy handed than in the original & it is less satisfactory too. It is almost as though nothing has changed, no progress has been made & this films story & the transformation the protagonist undergoes represents some kind of atavistic return to the fundamentals of the situation.In this sense it is arguably a more troubling, more overtly angry film than its predecessor. There is an awkward sense that Candyman's action in this film, almost represent some kind of racial justice, an idea that makes me feel rather ill-at-ease although I am myself not white. There was only really one scene that disturbed me in this sense & it was the bathroom scene where a group of young female students go through the candyman ritual & face the consequences. Five young women. One oriental in appearance leaves. Another black girl comes in goes into a cubicle & then in terror witnesses, much as we do, bad things happening out of sight.This does not seem to me like any kind of progress & I'm disappointed int he director, because I would say from holding the high ground at the beginning he loses it in this way.Other than that I enjoyed the film. The story comes together to some degree, but never feels entirely natural, although the narrative & performances are generally good enough to keep us interested. Overall, worth watching, but I'd have preferred something more thoughtful & less angry.",Candyman
138,aramsdale,MOUR LIKE SOURMAN,3,27 October 2021,"What a disappointment. Nothing scary or tense about it. No real drama or threat. Dull, boring & as usual nowadays, too long.

139,PerryAtTheMovies,"Not horrifying, but entertaining for sure...",6,27 August 2021,"Overall: 61/100 (6/10)Watching a movie is for entertainment and admiration of craft. Reviewing a movie is subjective. We each have our own storylines in life that allow us to see things differently than what others may see. That being said, my opinions on this film definitely differ from what other reviewers are saying.Also to note. I've not seen the original film so this review is based solely on the 2021 film.This movie definitely has a heavy factor of today's social issues ingrained into the story and I don't think that's entirely a bad thing. In fact, it may have helped this story progress a bit better. However, the story wasn't perfect in the sense that it left some plot holes unanswered. Despite these holes the story was engaging. I didn't find myself getting bored as the timing of 91' is perfect.The cinematography was good. Whether it was an angle creating some tension, or simply getting into the mind of the main character, or the lighting and colour schemes. Everything blended together for an enjoyable experience.This film was also gory even if it didn't show you straight on the carnage being created. The gore was slightly disturbing which made it feel like a slasher. I did get goosebumps here and there, but I never got scared which was a bummer.Overall, I didn't think this film was terrible. It would've been nice to have actually been scared. If one can get over the fact that social issues exist both in life and film then the story can be engaging enough for the entertainment to be had. Lastly, I wouldn't recommend going to theatres to see this one, but if you want to, try going for a cheap night.That's all for now, enjoy the show!",Candyman

142,jjr-76474,Jordan Peele is a very clever writer,7,13 October 2021,"Everything that is good in this movie is what was good in the movies he directed. The subversion of horror tropes in political fodder, the use of the safety net provided by the supernatural to unveil the brutal reality faced for too long by black people. In this regard Candyman 2021 works perfectly and leads to a grand ending.Unfortunately, as it has chosen not to be too scary and as limitedly graphic as possible for that kind of story, it feels slow and forced at times, despite good acting and nice camera work. The original candyman and horror fans may be put off by the pace and.the modesty of the gore. Fans of the movies mr Peele also directed may find the editing and camera work too tame.However, for the casual viewer not arriving there with particular expectations, this is a fine horror movie which keeps you interested up to a worthwhile ending.",Candyman
143,epicbrowniez,Cringe worthy like a bad Netflix original,6,1 September 2021,I love the original film and I will admit I was excited to see this. But the writing was stupid and felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy. And so many of the scenes were just boring or awkward to watch. I didn't think it was too terrible but I am a bit bothered that this is trying to be a remake of the 90s classic.,Candyman
144,Ansango,Unsatisfactory,5,6 October 2021,"This film is a weird mishmash of good ideas and a substandard execution. The biggest sin committed here is demystifying the lore of the candyman. While horror as a genre is especially known for veiling social commentaries under its supernatural facade, it shouldn't be too on-the-nose like this film. Every idea here is explored as shallowly as possible and the ending is bad. The third act reveals are preposterous and the ending seems like they ran out of the script.While I was not a very big fan of the original film, after watching this I have to say it was far better and much more thematically consistent than this slog-fest. The first film was a brilliant tale about the entanglement of legends and folk-lores and its impact on a segregated community.Abdul Mateen is the heart-and-soul of this film and he is astonishing here. The Cinematography is awe-inspiring especially during the opening credits, it has a strange hypnotic rhythm to it.This film is such a disappointment because I really had high hopes for this one. Ultimately it crumbles due to its overtly superficial approach to its core ideas and a peculiar sense of detachment from its predecessor.",Candyman
145,FixedYourEnding,One of my toughest reviews yet,5,26 October 2021,"Candyman, in its new remade version, is not a bad movie. Good effects, camera work and acting, so why did I walk out feeling disappointed?I think overall is trying to do too much, while in fact it doesn't do anything particularly well. First, it is not scary, there are some unpleasant scenes and quite a lot of gore but it fails at creating high tension. There is slow character build up, which can be good, but in this case it just slows the pace of the movie down without really increasing how much we care about the characters (news flash- I didn't) and thirdly, there is all the woke stuff. Ok, we get it, the white man is responsible for all the bad in the world (unless they are gay and have a black boyfriend) but this shoveling of manifest down our throat does not make anything better either.I think this movie ultimately fails on all 3 accords, it is not tense, scary or socially educating. With that said it is hard to trash it completely due to the excellent production value of the movie as a whole. I ended up giving it a 5, I would say- watch on your own risk, not because it plays any tricks on your mind, but just because you might be disappointed at the end, just like I was. Exact score: 53 / 100.",Candyman
146,maakus,Not a good way to go.,3,22 September 2021,"It's pretty clear by now that Jordan Peele have a gigantic chip on his shoulder when it comes to white people (which is kinda interesting since he's half white) and he's never subtle with his feelings in his movies. In Candyman it's more blatant than ever; all white people (and white cops) are cruel, stupid, mean and evil, so kill all the white people!I don't know if Peele gets off on being ""provocative"" in his blatant unwitty ways and goes ""Haha! Look at all these b*tthurt angry racists react!"" - but either way, it's not clever and it's probably more counterproductive than helpful. His ""anti racism"" is equivalent to pushing a dogs face in filth, until the dog, one day, bites back. It's fueling dislike, hate and anger in both ways, instead of handling problems and bringing people together.But besides this, Candyman is a strange ""horror"" movie. The fact that the director chose to play down and make most of the killings happen off screen, makes it play out more like a quite boring flatlining tv drama, instead of an intense horror movie and the story isn't intriguing or good enough to stand on it's own legs, without the ""flavour"" of gore and suspense.The acting and cinematography was pretty decent tho and kudos for not using tons of jump scares ...but not kudos for removing scares totally.",Candyman

Of course I remember when the 1st one came out so there's been A LOT of desensitization since then. That being said there have been lots of other films recently that made me more uneasy than this. If you take that into account you should enjoy Candyman 2. There was also a revenge theme that plays itself out throughout the film that culminates in a satisfying ending in my opinion.

What happened Jordan? Where did all start to go so wrong?This movie screams politics during the first 30 minutes, important issues but nothing to do with a horror movie, especially one that is supposed to be a sequel to a much loved classic, way too obvious and distracting from the story.In short, man is an artist, hears about the Helen Lyle story (not Candyman) looks at the old Gabrini site, meets someone there who tells him about Candyman. Man then uses the story to inspire his artwork. Two people are killed ( don't really see much) Man slowly becomes possessed and taken over. A few murders, not shown on screen as someone else mentioned. And that's how to take a classic horror and make a sequel in 2021.The ridiculousness and acting was the final nail in the coffin for me.This wasn't a horror movie neither did I even really understand half of it.

Has great moments, some wooden acting at times and more of a bite-size story than the first one, with some moments of good tribute sprinkled in. Could have been better but is nice to see the source material of the short story live on and dovetail with the first film for a sequel treatment reboot.

The pacing is off so it seems like almost nothing of great consequence happens for nearly 2/3 of the movie (you could throw maybe 40 minutes in the middle out and make this an episode of The Outer Limits). Even if not related to the original I don't think I'd rate it any higher. All the elements are supposed to be an allegory to ""a window to the past"" so to speak, but it doesn't come across as deep in any way, which I think they want you to think this film is. The acting is good though and the special effects are decent. Maybe something to toss on during the Halloween horror season but unlikely to leave a lasting impression.",Candyman
157,marcgreenman,slow first half plot building leads to really good scares later on,8,27 August 2021,"I was very interested in seeing this film mainly due to jordan peele's previous movies get out and us, both good horror movies with good scares original ideas and things to say. I have to say that i was very pleased with the result, although to my mind the first half of this movie was perhaps a little slow, certainly much slower than the second half where most of the horror and scares lie. This is not really a serious criticism as the first half performs an essential task in building important story elements including character background, setting, back story and themes, elements which pay off later on. The film works better in the end because it spends time and effort working on these important points. The film maintains continuity as far as i could tell with the original and i will certainly be giving the original another look based on what i experienced here. Yahya abdul mateen grew on me as the film progressed, at first i did not like his character who seemed to be a bit obsessed and even self centred but yahya's performance made the character's weaknesses believable and gripping on a dramatic level, as he becomes more unhinged during his pursuit of the candyman legend which becomes his downfall in every way. Teyonah parris is good and likeable as the girlfriend and becomes eventually my identification figure more than yahya's character does; at first i was much more on his side but my perspective definitely changed throughout the movie. Colman domingo was a completely new face to me but again he was very good, providing one of the faces of evil within this film surprisingly enough and i never saw it coming, just a laundry attendant of all things yet with a really nasty side in the end, as we find out. Michael hargrove was very good too, playing the original candyman character as well as his supernatural later form. Overall i thought that all of the actors did quite well here, the list above were the ones which stood out for me. Evil within this film comes in a number of different forms, at first oen thinks that the candyman is evil, then it emerges that there are other sides, society itself is depicted as full of unpleasantness, racism amongst the police force is one of the key underlying messages. For me, one of the best scares came very near the ending, when teyonah parris is sitting in the back of a police car following a series of murders and the cop says some very frightening things to her, this underlying racism theme gives this film more substance and indeed is present from the beginning, with the candyman's sad fate (he never apparently used razor blades after all, someone else did so he was innocent) an important early moment. Shadow puppets are used on occasion, although i have never seen this used in a film before it worked quite well and made a nice contrast with the standard filming. The cgi within the film is used sparingly to make physically impossible events work, and they do, although you can tell where the cgi has been used it makes for some dramatic moments and gore. The makeup effects used for yahya's physical decline match his inward mental decline and were sometimes too disgusting to look at, i did look away from the screen once or twice. The murders when they came were quite bloody, and not necessarily handled in the way one might have expected, some imagination was used in the way that they were shown, making them more interesting. The theme of obsession is very important within this film, as yahya's character anthony becomes obsessed with the candyman and with trying to create new works of art, which comes with serious and upsetting consequences.",Candyman
158,brentn,Weak installment,5,25 September 2021,"Just because someone notable puts there name on a movie does not make it good. Especially since you're not Steven Spielberg but Jordan Peele. This newest installment of the Candyman franchise follows a young painter taking on a new venture when he discovers that his surrounding neighbourhood was once Caprini-Green, the old stomping ground of the mythical Candyman killings. I was not scared at all watching this movie, nor did I feel any suspense or chills during the entire 2hr runtime. The only thing this movie had was some decent acting and the effects were well done. The killings were not very inventive at all and some were even off screen which made it all a little tame for a slasher. They did manage to keep some of the original tellings and delve into the mythos a little more which I liked but because we only know of Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd's Candyman) it felt a little hollow when trying to form the history. Also the whole ""woke narrative"" that people are writing about is nonsense in the sense that Candyman was always woke and a bout racist and inner city gentrification so obviously folks never saw the original or missed the point completely. In the end it was not boring but a little disappointing, watch if your into slashers or curious. 5.5/10.",Candyman
159,johnnyhbtvs27,The Candy Man Can,5,9 September 2021,"Bit of a mix bag this one. I liked all the call backs to the original like hearing Virginia Madsen on the tape and Vanessa Williams appearing. The shadow puppetry was a good way of exploring the background of the Candyman legend.What i didn't like was the beat you over the head subtext and obvious metaphors all throughout the movie, it becomes very repetitive after a while. The performance of Colman Domingo was also a surprise, a very good actor (great in Ma Rainey) he plays this so over the top it becomes a bit of a joke by the end, his character didn't have the greatest arc either.Nice Tony Todd appearance aside, the ending is also rather abrupt and ends on a whimper. A mixed bag indeed. Shame.",Candyman

162,actaction,More Metaphor Than Substance,4,18 September 2021,"I'm a fan of Jordan Peele's brand of filmmaking, even though I haven't liked 2 of the 3 films I've seen he was involved. This one be only co-wrote with a new-ish director and I give them a lot of credit for appreciating the original film's vibe and continuing it here with some great mood, camera angles, quality acting. However, while the film has all the good STUFF to spin a powerful and disturbingly raw film it starts not delivering on the moment to moment tension and thrills with a promise of more to come later. We keep getting further and further from the attack scenes, with one literally shot from far outside a skyscraper (cool shot, but not scary). The film fails over and over to do its #1 job of being scary and disturbing on the surface as it starts digging in deep to the subtext. Here we feel Peele's influence, where a film should mean more than it says his films tend to say more than it means and the rest is left up to abstract elements that leave you thinking but also leave you wanting. At the end, at best it comes of as an exercise rather than a product and at worst comes off as preachy and half baked. Candyman (part 4) falls somewhere between the two ends. Characters are rich and lore is appreciated, but it's thrown out to make Candyman (or men) an anti-hero... but it isn't willing to completely throw out the edge of horror either so we're left to root for a supernatural serial killer(s), who kills people simply for believing in him enough to risk saying his name, who have not directly wronged anyone (that we know of) nor been shown to be especially bad people (that we see). I would have been fine to use Candyman as an anti-cop anti-hero... but it should have been clearly established that the specific cops he killed were evil, directly responsible (for example) of the current Candyman's wrongful death. Even the cop trope near the end which sets the finale in motion we could see how, given a man with a hook has been described as killing people, could be reasonably shot by a scared cop. It wants to make a point about police misconduct, but it doesn't want to spend the time to develop it, rather throw it in at the end in one big heap & hope you just go along with it. So, we get a movie which doesn't have the scares of the original, doesn't have the mood when it needs it most (the kill scenes) because it keeps pulling us out of it and must make Candyman more invisible so we like him more and don't scrutinize his actions and overreactions against innocent people & also decides to try to throw in a modern and underdeveloped cop=bad plot while also giving the cops many reasons to be justified to overreact. There's a lot of great stuff here: the ""say his name"" line which parallels the BLM ""say their names"" slogan, the moment she looks in a dark room and just says ""nope"" (points for that) & even though the gay characters are a little cliche they are at least represented and not just minced meat for an easy kill. Still, this falls way short of the potential here and with all the expertise behind it this was a true shame. Should have been better and showed more than it made broadly painted and easily undone metaphors.",Candyman
163,Rainbowbeany,Better than expected,8,26 August 2021,I had a good time with my friends watching this. There were some really creative scares. It's better than I thought it was going to be. I highly recommend! It's the best Candyman movie.,Candyman
164,MackMonMay87,"Nothing Wrong with the Message, It's How You Deliver It",6,30 August 2021,"A lot of the user reviews here look to be a part of a review-bombing crusade, something I see way too much of these days on IMDB with any piece of pop-culture that dares to feature themes that reflect on society. Make no mistake, a lot of the low-star reviews on here are rated that way clearly because the subject matter, messages, and themes of Candyman (2021) make these reviewers uncomfortable.Candyman doesn't fall short *because* of the important themes and ideas discussed, it falls short in-spite of them.Characters blatantly lecture each other on gentrification and the process of how city planning has affected communities of color, even though all of the characters in this scene know this information already. The dialogue in these scenes is so blunt and clunky, they don't sound like a natural conversation between friends, even when talks between friends turn to serious topics. I think this is more what's actually bothering people about Candyman.Using Candyman as a metaphor for a vengeful ghost of our country's long and ugly, mostly unacknowledged history of racially motivated brutality is an interesting concept that even ties into the original movie. The idea of using horror to comment on some of the more troubling parts of our society is 100% valid, but not with a story like this, or dialogue like this. Nia DaCosta is clearly a very talented director visually, but the writing team needed to spend more time constructing the story and constructing a solid horror movie first, then figure out a way to weave in the messages skillfully.The movie has a great creepy atmosphere, I really enjoyed how the movie looked, with a great opening shot of a reverse/mirror-world Chicago skyline and ominous music all throughout. All of the cast turns in committed and convincing performances with the material they were given, the kills are visually interesting, and even the make-up on the new Candyman looked unsettling. The physical aspects of this were all solid.I'm surprised that considering the way social media in the 10s, and 20s has been used to spread the word about racial violence in real life that the movie didn't find a way to incorporate technology and the internet into how Candyman reached his victims and grew in power in modern times. Saying Candyman in the mirror 5 times seems like it easily could've been a social media challenge.The script changes the way the Candyman ghost operates last minute, a character has a disgusting and festering wound that's obviously infected and nobody remarks on it, and he's even the last person seen with someone Candyman kills, acting suspiciously, and doesn't get questioned by the police (which considering the angle of police violence this movie is trying to expose seems like a missed opportunity). A character at the end is kidnapped and taken to witness the birth of the new Candyman with no reason given as to why she should be alive at that point. It's stuff like this that holds back Candyman 2021, not the content about society, race, and violence.All of that is more than fair game to be discussed through art and pop-culture, and I have a feeling a lot of the negative reviews on here would prefer they never heard these issues brought up by anything or anyone, ever.Stick with the works of George Romero or ""Get Out"" if you want horror that actually has a message along with a great movie, but if you're curious about this one like I was, you can do worse for an afternoon at the movies also.",Candyman
165,randreww,Shockingly bad. Not joking. Read below,1,1 October 2021,"The Direction is disastrous from the get go - interrupting the film every so often with these childish ""Paper Cutouts"" stories to cover for a lack of competency. The music is dire, repetitive, dull, forgettable & frustratingly lacking in coherence. The dialogue & mixing is austere & lazy. Often using Studio takes with ""Room Reverb"" added in post to avoid any real boom-mic work. The cinematography is cheap; sticking to studios, & creating a closet environment & show-room housing & ""Lift & Launderette"" tropes. The script is beyond insulting, bland, struggling for ideas to appear, the pacing & acting are all over the place, & any competent film goer will find it hard not to cringe every other scene. It's bad. REAL bad! In fact, I doubt I have seen a film this bad since Terrifier (2016). The true Horror of Candyman 2021 dawns upon you around the half way mark; knowing you've got another half to get through without you sticking razor blades in sweets & swallowing them yourself. Being murdered by Candyman would be a mercy compared to having to watch this turd again. I'd rather rather que up to see the Dead Queen-Mum's Coffin again. I'd rather snort Bees wax through my tear ducts. I'd rather watch a Football Match knowing the outcome or slide down a razor blade with a testicle each side than to wade through this.. this..

They could've fleshed out Breonna's Dad's suicide and artwork. The ""lair"" was underutilized. And a little too much comic relief for me; the original was very dreadful and scary.

170,guskeller,Intellectual challenge disguised as a fun ride,7,7 September 2021,"Jordan Peele has made a name for himself by elevating the neglected genre of horror and combining it with fitting social commentary. Candyman falls right in line. However, Peele's work might be outdone in this project because director, Nia DaCosta (who is also a co-writer) brings a very intentional atmosphere to this film. The imagery is consistently striking, the sound is vivid, and the somber tone is executed perfectly. Candyman could have easily come off silly or ham-fisted but, instead, was delicately balanced, knowing just how far to push its themes.Both Yahya Abdul-Mateen and Teyonah Parris provide layered performances and display wide ranges of emotions, which adds to the overall richness to this already ample production. Each lead character has enough going on to keep audiences guessing. It really is refreshing to be surprised by the twists and turns of this story. Yet, despite the many strengths of Candyman, the cinematography is king here. So much creativity and revelation is loaded into the imagery of Candyman that it is undoubtedly the driving force of the movie. Ultimately, Candyman is an intellectual challenge disguised as a fun ride that should satisfy viewers looking for either type of experience.Writing: 8/10

171,kbtoys100,This is not a horror film.,4,18 September 2021,"I avoided reading anything before seeing this movie. I wanted desperately to like it.When I settled down with my popcorn and soda and the film began, I'm certain I had a smile on as the film began. When the first murders happened I thought, ""alright, not too bad"". But then the film kept going, and by the end my optimistic attitude had been sapped from me.Look, Candyman has always had a racial side to it (the films anyways, the original story took place in Britain and was very different) but unfortunately the makers of 2021s film were so preoccupied with hitting us over the head with this that they forgot they were making a horror film.Candyman is a largely joyless experience. With the exception of the first kill scene, all murders until the finale are off-screen. For a slasher film, off-screen kills have always been a death blow. And even when we finally get several hook-kills at the end, they are shot at a distance and are all slashing with CGI blood spray.Director Nia DaCosta clearly has some talent, and the film is well-made, well-acted, and does have some interesting ideas within, but it all adds up to a film with zero rewatchability.And don't get me started with how squandered Tony Todd was in this film. It was insulting they thought that would satisfy fans.",Candyman

It seems promising with some horrific killings shown with unique camera angles and an entertaining cast, I can't help to feel as if the film may have been rushed towards the end, leaving some confusion.The film leaves it open to interpretation.. maybe you have to watch it multiple times; but it doesn't compare to the other Jordan Peele influenced films.

I wasn't expecting it to hold up to the original and believe it's fine for any writer/director to take Candyman in a new direction. I'd seen reviews, so went in braced for the elements everyone has already heavily criticised.I was primarlily interested in seeing what they did with Candyman himself, Daniel Robitaille - slave, artist, lover, victim, father and legend. Well, they abandoned all that good stuff and reduced him to a brainless 'symbol'. There's no character here. He's not a whispered story, he's a klaxon for the filmmakers' myopic messaging, repeated ad nauseam. The whole thing clunks along, tediously, until the heavily foreshadowed, cop-out ending. Pun intended. I should have listened to the reviews.Say 'ACAB' into a mirror five times and this movie will appear behind you to ruin your evening.",Candyman
174,shawthingproductions,Someone take away Jordan Peele's crayons...,4,27 August 2021,"How is Jordan Peele still writing? ""US"" was an intriguing film failed by a thoroughly stupid ending which rendered every frame before that a waste. One ""twist"" and the whole thing came crumbling down and no matter what angle you looked at it from, the film was riddled with plot holes and now, this, The Candyman reboot.The acting, as with most of Peele's films to be fair, is great. No complaints. Some of the imagery is also great (such as Candyman being in the background of a shot but barely noticeable, just as a shame). It's creepy. It's well executed.The music is good. Some of the storytelling techniques are good (with the puppet-type shadow play for example) but the story itself is a hot mess. There were multiple writers involved and I am guessing Peele got involved for the ending because it involves a wannabe M. Knight style twist, like his other films. And, it just doesn't work.The first three quarters of the film are ""okay"". They're trying something new and whilst I wasn't overly keen with the direction they were taking I could appreciate it. Basically showing social injustices and white people versus black people BUT, the first film did that with Tony Todd's Candyman being a black slave who fell in love with a rich white woman (and was murdered for it). At times, this retelling felt like a lecture basically screaming that all white people are evil. I get it's social commentary but, come on.Anyway the last quarter comes along and it falls apart. This is where the writers decided to give the fans what they would really want from a Candyman film but, it just doesn't work. The explanation is show-horned in abruptly although, ironically, the actual ""reveal"" is well signposted from early on and very, very predictable. So much so, in fact, I felt insulted by the time they finally said what we, the audience, already knew.There's stupid moments too (such as the infected bee-sting). If you had something so very obviously wrong with you, you'd go to the doctors much faster and wouldn't wait until the character in question did. By this point you're just thinking he is an idiot and deserves what comes his way.My biggest bug-bear though is the kills and violence. In the other films, when Candyman finally killed someone - you saw it. It was violent, it was nasty. Here, he pops up and we cut away. We will see some blood on the floor, we will cut to a different scene entirely and just leave the kills to our imaginations. Hard to say who is to blame though - is it the studio wanting a lower age rating or was it the director's design? Whoever was responsible needs to go away though because - it was annoying. This is Candyman... Let us see The Candyman do what he has done well for 3 films before!Of all the films in the series, this is the weakest and a frustrating middle finger up to the original.",Candyman

It's visually beautiful and shot so well. Great atmosphere and direction, but the script is often lazy.It's got some great moments and some clever humor, but it falls flat at times. In his era I'm sure it'll be praised as deep and edgy, but it's rather dull and shallow to me. The original hit home on the sins of the past needing changed in the present far more than this one did. I get it, Jordan Peele thinks white people are awful, but I'd like a little more depth to his hatred and less lazy obviousness.Nia DaCosta Deserves all the praise, but Peele, who i usually like a lot, really phones the final act in. Feels more like a try hard rather than a success.I enjoyed a lot but I'd also change a bunch. The original spoke way more to me and in a more creative way, but the film is certainly worth a view.

But we never learn why and this plot thread is never resolved. Other than that, we know nothing of substance about any of these characters and thus do not care when they are in danger or die.Despite this, the actors really do give it their all and they make all of the scenes sufficiently watchable.

Like any Peel movie, Candyman did not disappoint, he knew how to impose fear, suspense, laughter and emotion at the precise moments.

While struggling to find inspiration, Anthony meets William (Colman Domingo) who tells the tale of Candyman. Using this new-found legend to create his exhibit, Anthony opens up the grisly past and violence follows his every step.The plot flows well in this sequel and follows similar beats as it's predecessor. The writing weaves the original film's story in so this can stand alone with no prior knowledge of the what occurred. The cast all do fantastic work in bringing anxiety and paranoia to the forefront.With mirrors playing a major role, I appreciated the attention to detail of the camera placement. The visual effects put in place to pull off mirror gags and people floating is a nice touch. The score that accompanies the fantastic cinematography add a layer to the story and a great sound design pulls you in deeper to the unsettling tone throughout.While the plot has a nice flow, there are areas that feel forced or jerky. With a short runtime of 91 minutes you lose detail. By adding time, some beats would feel organic instead of shoehorned.This film does a great job of introducing a new generation to the tale of Candyman.

186,JoelAlexanderr,An amazing horror film that needed to be thirty minutes longer,7,2 September 2021,"There is a lot to love about Nia DeCosta's highly-anticipated CANDYMAN, a spiritual sequel to the 1992 horror film of the same name. The gimmick of Candyman is simple: say his name five times into a mirror and he appears behind you, breathing down your neck, slicing you open with his hook for a hand. However, the mythology and the themes behind the concept are much more complex, involving the oppression of lower-class Black communities from as far back as the 1890s. My biggest gripe with the 1992 Candyman film was that it didn't focus enough on these powerful themes, and instead became a somewhat typical slasher flick told from a white perspective. CANDYMAN remedies my concerns and then some, focusing on the gentrification of modern-day Chicago while also highlighting how the legend of the Candyman is emblematic of Black struggle for over a hundred years.While this improves upon the original Candyman in many ways, it also begets new issues that keep CANDYMAN from being the horror classic that it should be. The film runs at a painfully short hour and 30 minutes, and never gets to the point where the fantastic ideas introduced feel fully developed -- an extra 30 minutes or even an hour would have done wonders for the pacing and meaning of this movie. However, the 90 minutes that audiences get are masterfully crafted, with DeCosta giving audiences a quick taste of what hopefully will expand into a wonderful career. The scenes of slasher horror are damn near perfect -- DeCosta shows restraint at the right moments while showing just enough death to create some truly disturbing sequences.With horror movies, every single aspect of the movie must come together in order to truly scare viewers -- sound design, score, acting, cinematography, production design, direction, etc. -- and everything pulls through with CANDYMAN. The best scenes in this film are some of the best horror scenes all year in these aspects, especially the haunting score from Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe and the impressive makeup and visual effects. Unfortunately, the one aspect that sometimes falls short is the screenplay, which often feels rushed and forgets to fully develop its main characters. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, one of the most talented up-and-coming actors in the industry, is never given enough to work with from a character perspective and could have used far more scenes where his character's personality is seen clearly. Teyonah Parris, another fantastic up-and-coming actress, is almost given a very interesting character arc, but the script never expands on what exactly she is going through, making it difficult to feel on an emotional level. Colman Domingo, one of the best character actors working today, has the most interesting character in the film whose arc is cut short quickly after a sudden plot twist that does not serve any of the characters.CANDYMAN is roughly two-thirds of a horror masterpiece. Its short runtime takes the amazing concepts regarding the way white society takes advantage of Black creators and culture in general and never expands on them enough to create a cohesive whole. Despite feeling rushed during the last 30 minutes, DeCosta still makes sure to include some memorable scenes of gory slasher goodness, which should satisfy any horror junkies looking for them.

189,deshan-78580,Okay,6,4 September 2021,"This reboot-sequel to the 1992 Candyman movie overall was alright, it had some good things, but also plenty of downsides as well. The downsides include weak character development, social/race commentary too in your face (first film did it better!), most of the deaths are off-screen, and the ending was incredibly rushed.The positives I do have for this movie are decent acting performances, very good cinematography and production values, cool visual effects, not bad direction from Nia DaCosta, and at least an above average musical score.At least it's better than the other two Candyman sequels Farewell to the Flesh (meh) and Day of the Dead (trash), so there's that I guess, but the first movie is still the absolute best & pretty much the only great one in the franchise. And as a Jordan Peele written/produced movie, Get Out and Us both were much more impressive flicks as well. Best to go in into this new Candyman movie with low expectations.",Candyman

I feel this was entertaining and captivating. I don't understand how it was getting such bad reviews I guess people really weren't watching the film closely. Definitely watch it. I think Jordan Peele nailed it again. You can't have a decent horror movie without some sort story, and I feel he did a good job setting up the story which some people feel was too slow and boring. I guess a lot of people nowadays have an attention span like a woodpecker.",Candyman

If one really intends to draw attention and make people think about this shameful and terrible thing racism is, try a documentary, a drama or cinebiography. It would had been more effective.I love Jordan Peele's work, he did a fantastic job on BlacKkKlansman (producer) and Get Out (producer/director), he wrote and produced this new installment on Candyman lore, but not everything must be about social statement. Sometimes all a horror movie needs to be is a horror movie.By the end, things get eye for an eye... Candyman becomes a vigilante and mass murder lots of white people. So, means we should fight violence with violence?Anyway, movie is boring, drags from the very beggining, acting is dull, there are no jump scares at all, plot is shallow and the ending twist is lame.",Candyman

200,adotson-98233,A visually mesmerizing horror movie,7,6 September 2021,"""Candyman"" 2021 is a very good sequel/reboot for the franchise. Featuring fantastic cinematography, great acting, and some truly unsettling yet very true messages.What I liked about this movie is the acting. It's very good, and everyone gives such a powerful, and real performance. The movie also is just absolute gorgeous to look at. The shots are so well done, and the movie has many creative ways to film the kills, it's just so impressive. The movie also has a lot of very deep and great themes about racism just like the first one. And finally the movie is just so well paced for the first 2 acts that I got so invested and never bored.However I said the first 2 acts were greatly paced, that didn't mean the same for the 3rd act. Now what I didn't like about the movie is of course the 3rd act. It just felt so rushed, and ended things very quickly. I wanted more of that final act. Also there's a scene in the movie where a character has a dream sequence. And I felt that it didn't add really anything to the movie.Overall despite a very rushed 3rd act, ""Candyman"" is a very well done, and thought provoking horror film with great acting, fantastic cinematography, and some very deep themes.",Candyman

I am a white guy and I really enjoyed the movie and the sad truth is that, these sorts of things still happen in todays world. Anyway back to film.Yes It is a slow burn movie but it's progressive and delivers with a punch. And the final 30 seconds of the film... wow makes it all worth it. Not gonna say too much about it apart from the fact that it deserves to be the sequal to candyman. Really hope they make a direct sequal, because that, I gotta see. Thumbs up from me.",Candyman
202,gillman11,Impressive Sequel/Reboot,8,10 September 2021,"Overall, a very impressive attempt at breathing life into an aged property.Although there are pacing issues with the first part, the film makes up for it with some imaginative sequences.The use of reflective surfaces and a couple of inspired elements that give a new spin on imagery you've seen before. The slow pull back from the apartment building being particularly good.There will no doubt be outcry from the usual quarters at the polemic of the theme but the truth is sometimes you've got to be obvious to make sure people don't misinterpret your point. Which is a shame for fans of subtlety but needs must.Big fan. Interested to see what Nia DaCosta does next and whether there are interesting places the rebooted Candyman can go.",Candyman
203,afrocut,Sweet and sour,6,5 September 2021,"Something about the new Reboot/sequel of the 2021 ""Candyman"" seems missing. The original is a cult classic mostly because of it's strengths : the creepy tone, the great acting of Tony Todd and the gore. This new movie seems to be lacking on all three. The tone is never scary, intriguing yes, but creepy? Not really. The acting is fine, but Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , an actor I always love in everything I've seen him in, seems muted here almost just a viewer in his own movie. Certainly not the role defining gravitas that Tony Todd brought to the role, but those are big shoes to fill. And then there's the biggest disappointment, the lack of practical effects and shocking gore of the original film. This film almost feels shy on this point, trying hard to show death as creatively as possible instead of us feeling it's realistic and emotional weight. This helps move away from the horror element and into the heavy message aspect of the film. Which brings me to the original movies faults : a very 90s aesthetic, which is to colorful at times, the confusing lore and heroising of white people. These are all things the movie works to fix and mostly succeeds on. Here the color and choice of visual tone really works to give the movie a bleak feel, although it never truly hits on the artistic highs of the graffiti in the first film. The lore has always been something confusing and messy in the franchise, but here they work hard to make it gel into a vengeful entity of all those wrongfully accused for the color of their skin. This is something I really wanted to see done better in the franchise and here it's a good start. Of course that isn't to say it's interpretation of all white people as horrible and incentive is the best choice. But I get why it's done. Unfortunately the movie is bleak and ends abruptly on a sour note, and not a great one. But we are treated to my favorite aspect during the credits , the score by Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe and the striking shadow puppets by Manual Cinema. These are some of the most powerful images and tones throughout the film and it was very clever to leave us with it on our way out.",Candyman
204,3_the_monkey,Gutted..........,5,16 September 2021,"I had not seen the original film so I was excited to see this, but I had a general idea of the original and the plot and love the premise!Let me start with to be completely honest, the film isn't not scary whatsoever, yes there is some blood but no jumps... more of a thriller...I heard a lot of people say the original candy man was absolutely amazing, really scary and a great horror, very excited!! But...... I didn't get that from this film, overall I enjoyed it and yes it was good, but not what I was hoping for.Personally I don't like hearing people described as orange/yellow/black/white/brown man/woman and therefore when I did it hear it (quite frequently) it distracted from the film and annoyed me, but it stayed on the right side of it and didn't lose me.Acting was good, plot was loose but good, not a huge amount of story but held on to me, hung a lot off the original film history, I enjoyed it and was routing for the lead woman at the end!Then... it tipped it over the edge and did what I hoped it wouldn't.......... became less about a film and more about propaganda, such a shame...If it had been scary and a horror and lived up to my expectations then I would have given it a 7, but it wasn't so minus 1, just scary whatsoever maybe a 6, minus 1 for the propaganda which I had to sit through so a 5 and if I'm honest I am thinking a 4 as I was left disappointed so much by the film carrying the name 'CandyMan' and I was expecting so much more.",Candyman

The amount of money they just have spent to make a boring, overwrought, tedious movie at a mere 90 minutes is criminal.This was a much anticipated horror remake.

The callbacks to the first film were intelligent, and effective, and the storytelling in general was good. While there were a few problems in editing and dramaturgy, and the film could have been a few minutes longer to let some scenes and themes develop with more logic.Still, a very strong film, and a very strong message. You rarely see a slasher film with such thoughtful storytelling, and artistic vision. Though I expect the theme behind the story to either not register with much of the audience, or simply alienate them because racism and police violence are topics that cause irrational denial in the States.",Candyman

The first one was so brutal as to really make you horrified. I guess horror movies aren't really geared towards horror anymore.The cast did a pretty good job, and the story seemed to follow the legend, but some of the storyline points seemed a bit rushed and/or under developed.Overall it was a horror movie worth a watch if you like the Candyman character(one of the most scary of them all).

Get ready for Nia DaCosta's name to be a staple in the horror genre, and I'm talking at the level of Wes Craven. There's no part of Candyman I can really critique. If I had to, I would say I would've like more of the original soundtrack or at least a variation of it, but Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe's score is far from disappointing. The story could've been a bit less choppy towards the end, but it's still wildly entertaining. Writing was the weakest part of the film, and really the only weak part. The best part? Cinematography; it could've been the bland camera cuts that nobody cares for, but instead there are some uncut sequences, creative mirror shots, and zooming. This movie is all around stellar, adding so much more to the original, and should be a classic years from now.",Candyman
215,Darvener,"This is a good nonsensical story for little kids, but bad story for teens and adults",1,11 October 2021,"After more than 20 years Jordan Peele and Nia DaCosta decided to bring a new version of Candyman from 1992, but it is not good. Story of this movie follows man Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who is quite a successful artist and one day he is finding what he can to paint. One night he hears a story from a place that is near to his apartment and he tries to find any inspiration for his new paintings and from this moment things are going worse.Director Nia DaCosta has behind one movie 'Little Woods' - a critically acclaimed movie. Nia DaCosta failed in her role as director in this movie. Director and executive producers are responsible for the movie and these people failed, because they made a movie very strong below the average. The intro for this movie is not well crafted because there are two minutes of only music; text of producers, writers, etc and many shots of buildings from below. There is not any problem that this intro has two minutes, not at all, but there is a problem with the shots - the shots look for the first ten or fifteen seconds cool and pretty well done but after forty five seconds or minute, this is unwatchable and painful to watch. Next, this movie failed as a horror because there is not built any atmosphere of the movie. It is very hard to build a very good and strong horror atmosphere but this makes the horror movie.Screenplay is written by Jordan Peele (most known for Get Out), Win Rosenfeld (most known as a producer) and Nia DaCosta (most known for the Candyman 2021 movie). The most interesting part of this movie for many viewers is that this movie is written by Jordan Peele, but in this movie he failed. Writers created a horror cliché story from 90's, which is very bad because in 90's was easier to create a horror movie with talking to mirror and summon someone because this was new and original story for these years, but for today this is very good nonsensical story for little kids, but not that good for teens and adults. The Dialogue in this movie is very bad and the characters don't talk like regular people, all of the dialogues don't feel natural. There is character development but not that good, because they wanted to take it very fast and they forgot about the character development. As I said the character development is here but not that good for a good movie. There were in some scenes very illogical decisions and some things in this movie are very illogical. Writers did a very average job here because they completely forgot about the atmosphere - this is one of the reasons why this movie does not have any atmosphere.The casting director did a good job here but not that good. Some characteristics of some characters don't fit the actors and it looks weird. Performance of the actors in this movie is on a very strong average and sometimes the performance is below average. Maybe this is the type of actors that they need the director to push them to bring better performance, but there the director Nia DaCosta failed. The average performance of actors here is very obvious and this is the reason why this movie has no atmosphere and why almost everything feels unnatural.Camera was in some scenes pretty good and as I said the shots of the buildings from below are cool and pretty good but this is only a few scenes from the entire movie. The director of cinematography used in some scenes an old style of shooting a movie, but he failed. The old style doesn't fit the style and theme of the movie.Music in this movie is very good and the composer did a very good and solid job.Editor of this movie after all the killers, she has done the last stab, because she didn't realise that she is not editing any video on YouTube. The editing is so amateur that it is very hard to watch and from a professional company is this very unprofessional that a movie like this is editing an unprofessional human like this. Editor in some cases did an inappropriate cut that killed everything that the writers and director wanted to create. The editing of the SFX here is very bad too. Director and editor forgot that the sound of light does not have to be for every light. They made the SFX so loud that after some sounds of light it was annoying. In some cases they made SFX so bad that it was in some scenes very unnatural.Remake of Candyman from 1992 is a big disaster and they failed in creating this movie. The story is not remade for the year 2021, so the story feels very old. This is a very good but nonsensical story for little kids, but not that good for teens and adults. After seeing the trailer of Candyman 2021 version this is a big disappointment and everything that looks good is put into the trailer.14%",Candyman

Nia DaCosta's film follows a young artist who gets interesting the Candyman legend and, bit by bit, helps to bring his spirit back to claim more victims.Dripping with mood and powered by a spooky electronic score, this new take on Candyman has all the atmosphere any horror fan could want, but it's frightfully low on scares and suspense. This isn't the fault of the cast (all of whom are excellent), but probably on the confusion that came about by having three writers credited on the screenplay. Interesting concepts are brought up and discarded without much thought, leaving the film feeling a little shaky and unsure of what it's trying to say.

220,pacocharte,Meh. Not scary at all.,5,17 September 2021,"This one has nothing on the original. I wasn't exactly young when that one came out and I was legitimately scared to utter ""Candyman"" 5x in any mirror. This film, like ""Get Out"", has great cinematography and acting, but never once scares any fan of the horror genre.The story was flat and I walked away disappointed. Personally I didn't mind the ""historical"" racial relations angle as much as some other reviewers, but the way it was presented was flat and too prominent. There could have been a solid film in the concept but it was written/directed in a way that just didn't bring me in or make me care one way or the other.If anything, I think the film should have spent another 20 minutes on character back story in the lead up. Instead what we get is a 1:30:00 movie that is deeply unsatisfying but well filmed and fun to look at. Too many dumb story holes too. For example, the wasp sting on his hand - he and everyone around him just allow it to fester? Like even his gf didn't drive him to a doctor??? Dude looked like he had leprosy and needed medical attention less than halfway into the film.All's I can really say here is ""Meh"" if you're bored and have an hour and a half to kill, wait for it to hit the streaming services. It's not worth a trip to the theater and $10+ a ticket. Too bad, because again, there was a lot of potential in the concept.",Candyman

And worst of all: it's not scary. Not for a single second.

222,ulex_stovetop,Brilliant,9,29 August 2021,"'Candyman' 2021 is a brilliant successor to the 1992 original 'Candyman' - why they feel to make sequels with the same name as the classic film I will never know, but that is beside the point - that takes the infamous spirit beyond the man and turns him into a legacy. While the original sequel films certainly dive into this theme, neither does it with such elegancy. Nia DeCosta and Jordan Peele masterfully add to the legend of the spirit showing how Candyman is a collective of many damned rather than the history of an individual. Nia's vision executes this massage with undeniable beauty, using reflection and negative space to make every shot a work of art. The shadow puppet sequences, above all else, stand as a work of genius to deliver exposition that has permanently etched its way into my sub-conscience. Of course, knowing the original film enhances the experience, but I believe all views will be able to take something great out of the picture.",Candyman
223,passan-80670,Beetlejuice > Candyman > Bloody Mary,3,16 September 2021,"Lets start with the obnoxious point first. This Movie is racist against whites. Why is preaching racism accepted? Not saying there are no valid points, but what is a white supremacist? They use this word but there is no meaning behind it.The script and the story were off? It is difficult to explain. It feels like someone who never saw a horror movie tried to make one. For example, the tone is great. However, the deaths are ether comical or have no real impact. Especially how bland the main and the support characters are affected by them. Basically not at all. Although the deaths were really well done, especially the deaths of the schoolgirls, that scene was fantastic. The script was still not very well communicated. No much reason why certain things happened.The thriller aspect was sort of neat. I enjoyed how ""crazy"" the main character was, although he did not receive any development.The main actor is great. Not in this movie sadly, BUT every time I saw him, he was a different character. I now want to see him in a good movie where he gets to show his acting talent.The shadow figures instead as flashbacks were fantastic. Very creative. The cinematography was alright.

This movie is SO GOOD.It is a true child of the original, seamlessly weaving in the 1992 film's plot and expanding on the issues it presented. Yes, the original film was about race and class too. It's almost as if these subjects are nothing new.It's a beautiful movie, amazingly shot, and well-acted. This is not a jump scare movie, it is a slow burn that fills you with dread. Just enough body horror and gore to satisfy those of us who enjoy such things. And yes, much of the horror is based on black people's actual lived experiences. It is based in systemic injustices woven into the fabric of our culture. The monstrous results will continue to exist until we examine them and are willing to admit the roles we all play.And apparently, a lot of folks are too scared to look in the mirror and see what's reflected in it.",Candyman

The rest of us enjoyed it.Beautifully filmed. Well directed. Good music. Good suspense. Adequate gore. Good story. It is certainly respectful to the original film (Which was also about systematic racism back in 1992.

The acting was top notch. I was rooting for the characters. The dialogue was excellent. The social commentary is very clear and effective and done with just the right touch. (Not heavy-handed, not there as an afterthought.)I guess a lot of people were dissapointed that it isn't scary like you would expect a typical horror movie to be, and I think that's a fair critisism, but unlike the supernatural backstories of most horror monsters, the backstory of Candyman, which is central to the film's plot and message, is firmly planted in reality. Ongoing reality, which makes this the most truely frightening horror movie of them all.Finally, I wonder if my familiarity with the art world added to my enjoyment of this film.

245,kstice-25195,A worthwhile addition to the Candyman franchise,7,29 August 2021,"While there are a few flaws in this film, Candyman (2021) ultimately creates an interesting addition to this horror franchise. Many of the low-rated reviews for this film criticize the film for the themes of gentrification and police brutality. I believe that the gentrification of Cabrini-Green added more depth to this film and helped make it more than just a standard slash film. Unfortunately, the theme of police brutality was more problematic. This theme could have added more depth and drama to the film, but the film does not adequately explore this theme and presents it from too one-sided of a view. The climax of Candyman is weakened due to an over-the-top and unrealistic portrayal of police brutality.Luckily, most people watch a horror movie for the scares and action rather than political themes. When it comes to the horror, the film creates many suspenseful scenes, great action, and creepy settings. Horror fans will not be disappointed in this regard. Additionally, there are unexpected and well-done connections to the first film. Candyman is worth a viewing. 7/10Pros and Cons Summary+Well-done horror and action+Interesting connections to the first film+Likeable characters-Theme of police brutality not as well done as theme of gentrification-Climax is a bit weak-Some events in the film seem unrealistic or not fully understood.",Candyman

Somewhere between the woke rhetoric and West coast dogma was a movie trying desperately to find its way to the screen. But in the end it failed to emerge and 90 minutes of my life was wasted. It's so sad when Hollywood has a good story and some good actors and yet they decided to ruin it with political crap.,Candyman
249,joncolley,"Slightly below average, non scary horror...",4,19 September 2021,"I enjoyed the original Candyman movie when I saw it years ago, less so the sequels which were, to be frank, garbage.So, I thought that I'd give this a go and see if it could provide a proper follow up to the events of the first Candyman and deliver something tense, creepy and actually scary - the trailers showed promise, hence me going to see it.Sadly, what it delivers is a couple of decent effects, no real scares and a whole lot of exposition.This movie really wants you to know that the police are murderous white people who just like killing black people. It also wants you to know that white people are ""bad"" as it proceeds to show you a series of vapid, wealthy white people being killed - less than a few minutes in and the main character is talking about about society being run by white supremacists and when corrected with ""you mean white people"" he just says ""yeah"" - expectations set right there... Groan...So we get a dull series of events, a few mostly dull murders, a confused and largely pointless scenes of 'stuff' which was really too dull to remember and then the police show up and murder a guy who is laid on the floor being propped up by a woman who moments before was about to be killed. Then we get to see what the film really wants to show - white police officers being murdered.Honestly it could have been done worse, but only it would have taken some real effort to do so. It isn't a worthy successor to the original, personally I'd recommend people just skip this.On a positive note, it looked nice. The camerawork was done well in the most part and I can only assume that the mix of obnoxious characters were intentionally obnoxious so they did that well...One thing which left me puzzled (and annoyed) all the way through the movie was; why would a young up and coming artist not be more concerned about their hand and arm slowly starting to rot? It was literally dropping to pieces but all he did was pick at it a bit and wrap a towel around it. His livelihood and career literally requires the use of that hand but he only went for medical help when his entire arm was rotting and the rot was creeping up the side of his face!All that said, I'm sure it will do well and win several accolades because of diversity etc. Having the overrated Jordan Peele won't hurt either.",Candyman

253,jprice-38253,Honestly really liked it!,8,29 August 2021,"Is this as amazing as the original? Of course not. But is it entertaining? Yes I should say so myself. After seeing this, not only has the Candyman song been stuck in my head lmao, but he is now one of my favorite horror characters for some reason. So the Candyman CAN for this one.We know when Jordan Peele is behind a project, there's no doubt it's going to be slightly bizarre, beautifully haunting and chilling. You'll know it when you see it! The surreal, yet creepy ambience throughout the movie is great! The cinematography is well done! The acting is good! The backstory and lore of the Candyman is explained and simple to understand! You'll enjoying seeing the Candyman himself. He does look cool! The blood and kills are a little gory. And with the whole plot itself, along with the characters, honestly you'll like everyone. There was not one character I disliked. Which is strange. Now I am giving it an 8/10, just because there was a tiny bit of political stuff that was thrown in here and it was just unacceptable. But besides that, let's put that to the side and just say here that you'll have fun watching this. Not only that, but it'll literally STICK with you after the movie lmao. Meaning my buddies and I walked out of the theater, and everyone was going to the bathroom saying Candyman in the mirror lol. And then it's like every time you eat or see Candy, you'll think of Candyman. Or every time you hear the song, which by the way is happily creepy/addictive, you'll think of once again, CANDYMAN LOL.But seriously, give this reboot a chance. I know a lot of people hate it because of course it's not the original. I guarantee the people are hating it are the ones that haven't even seen the movie, don't even bother to ACTUALLY watch it and just decide to give it bad review just because. Smh. Anyways, the movie delivers well for me in my opinion and there's just not that much else or anything bad I can really say about it.",Candyman
254,aciarleglio-1,This movie was a disgrace to Candyman,2,26 September 2021,"Using a horror Icon. One of my favorite all time to push a social message on people is a travesty. So what I learned from this movie is the police just want kill minorities immediately without any facts and will def cover it up.... So they need an evil avenger to get revenge for having to live in poor neighborhoods, and even though he murders people that do little more then are jerks with stuck up personalities , he's a hero. He's superman. Unleash murder on everyone that is a different than you. That is justice!!!The original candy man was a badass killer that scared me for many nights. This movie couldn't scare a 5 year old. Well it does prove how scary film makers that push agendas over and over again can get away with ruining movies. I give it two stars only because the main actors were good in my opinion, and the candyman concepts were decent but the execution was terrible and someone else should write the next installment . Make the next Candyman horror movie about horror again, not guilt. Please.",Candyman
255,AndyCordReviews,Visually appealing with a not so strong storyline,6,19 September 2021,"So I had no idea this movie was kind of a sequel to the original 90s movie I have yet to watch.So all I know about 'Candyman' is what I got from this movie, and I found the lore interesting and the cinematography truly compelling, the use of red and yellow as the stand-out colors also sets the movie on another level visually, as well as the animated storytelling moments.Now story-wise it is a bit too much in your face, you know what is going to happen from the get-go and there is no building up to it, what you see is what you get, and it could have used a bit more mystery to make us wonder about what exactly is going on.Another thing that bothered me is, I didn't care for the characters in the slightest, and when that happens in a horror movie, then you know you can only depend on the gore or on the crazy, scary, wacky stuff that is happening on screen, and that also wasn't that great. By the end, it relies too heavily on social commentary, but it doesn't quite know how to effectively transmit it and make you relate to it.So, overall, visually I loved it, story-wise it could have been a bit more developed and fleshed out.",Candyman
256,CinderFall,You all need to pull your head out of the sand,8,13 September 2021,"If you think that this iteration of Candyman is woke then you've clearly never seen or weren't paying attention to the 1992 entry. To pile on that, you also aren't familiar with the original story by Clive Barker named The Forbidden that was also politically charged but for a British reasoning. Nia DaCosta's Candyman is nothing different from those 2, just a modern sequel to the 1992 film to show that nothing has changed between then and now and that's a problem. This film is beautifully shot and has a lot of great sequences in it. If you're going into it with the expectations that it needs to be a linear structure then you're already leading yourself astray. This film opts for more disjointed sequencing which allows for a more creepy viewing experience, while not SCARY it is intensely creepy and will get under your skin. I would say ""give this a go"" but only if you're going in with good faith for the movie. If you weren't....why even bother?",Candyman

The art themes stem from the original, and is very prevalent in this one. A full circle movie. As an adult this film wasn't very scary. Doesn't mean it was a bad film. Wonderful film score.

I didn't even really have a problem with the ""anti cop"" undertone but what I didn't appreciate was the mix of rated R and PG13 slasher scenes.. When the first girl says Candyman 5x at the art gallery he slit her throat and it was pretty brutal and got me intrigued in the movie (I love slashers). But in the bathroom scene with the bullies you literally don't see anything. As a true horror fan I would have appreciated the consistency.Also it's kind of a mixed motive of Candyman, if he comes when you say his name fives times and kills you why didn't he kill Anthonys Girlfriend? Instead he killed the cops and basically set her free? Maybe it's because of her ties with Anthony I don't know. There were definitely some cool parts in the movie and I valued all the nostalgic displays but over all a tad bit let down.",Candyman
264,jeremiahlhorton,A Sequel with so much potential,4,28 August 2021,"This movie was very hyped for all the right reasons. It's a slasher film, a sequel or reboot you may call it, and Tony Todd reprised his role ... for like a second. I get we are in the age of reboots and sequels decades later, but this just wasn't it. First of all there were more questions than answers. This film is supposed to push the other ""alleged"" sequels to the side and give us something fresh, something old, something new, and something a bit more gorey, tagging along to the original to finish the job properly. Unfortunately, in every scene involving some poor fool to chant His name in the mirror five times, He appears from the shadows and give them their comeuppance. But ... it falls flat in every direction, only giving us off screen PG-13 kills. The film and story were both ok, but failed to explain the reason our beloved main character was fading into the darkness and dwindled on origin stories so much that the film itself forgot what pace it was going. Candyman Himself, was not even in the film until the last four seconds! I guess to live in his legacy, his stories inspire other ""Candymen"" to do the bidding, so he lives within those who avenge him? It's like they're lost in the story themselves. Anticipation was pulled and thrown into trash after seeing this. Slasher movie fans will be disappointed as well as casual horror moviegoers will be. I was so disappointed in this film. It wasn't dark and gritty, nor was it gloomy and thrilling, it was just bland. Tony Todd created the legacy of the titular film character and they wasted him with about five other people playing him rather than the actual person who is supposed to. Whatever direction they're going, they can keep it because it just will not work for those who've expected more.",Candyman
265,lukandkilt,"Not as good as the original, but definitely worth a watch",7,15 September 2021,"I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews here and, while it has its flaws, this movie certainly doesn't deserve as little as 1 star. Firstly, just as with the original, the music is stellar. It's a cleanly and interestingly shot film with a lot of movement and atmosphere. The characters are endearing, if a little under-explored.That's the main shortcoming in my opinion. This movie could've afforded another 30 minutes or more to tie up all its loose ends and incomplete character arcs. There's this unshakeable feeling that something has been cut out -- maybe some more flashbacks, or, better yet, a pay off for said flashbacks -- and that you're missing a few pieces of the puzzle. The last quarter feels like a speed-run attempt to produce a compelling, return-to-roots horror ending, but only winds up rushing clumsily to the credits.Honestly, I'd found myself invested in our lead until he disappeared from the movie abruptly, and by the time I'd re-adjusted to investing in his partner the movie had essentially ended. She seemed like an interesting character to follow so the hasty ending didn't do her justice.However, I did enjoy the commentary, and the film does feel like a natural extension of / revival of the original. The comments complaining that it's 'political' as opposed to horrific aren't entirely wrong, but the concepts are translated potently and have the exact outcome that any good horror movie should: discomfort, paranoia, and distress. Not to mention how good the school bathroom kills were!Was I scared? Maybe not. But was I disturbed, and set on edge by this story? Absolutely. It's got me thinking, and the soundtrack on repeat is going to keep me thinking!It's an imperfect movie with some meat on its bones -- enough to warrant a watch, and some time spent considering the message afterwards.",Candyman
266,eggrolljr,"Great trailer, but the movie falls flat",5,16 September 2021,"I was pretty excited for this one, especially when I heard it wasn't going to be another tiresome remake, instead a continuation of the first film's story. I give kudos to the filmmaker for not simply rehashing the story of the 1992 film, it definitely carves out it's own niche in the franchise. This sequel had just the right amount of callbacks without feeling like it was leaning on the first movie as a crutch. I also thought the casting and performances where fairly solid, I think it would be very easy for performers to drift through this kind of material, but it seems like everyone was on the same page.Having said all of that, I think the biggest failure of the film has to be that it simply isn't suspenseful. The story quickly devolves into character's running around encountering each other, while they piece together a fairly predictable plot that ultimately made very little sense. Deaths landed without impact because we never really got a chance to get to know any of these characters, there were no arcs or reason for the audience to invest in them. The high school murder scene was especially egregious for this.This was by no means a bad film, just a little disappointing. You can smell the racial politics that the film is drenched in, which isn't necessary a bad thing, however its so completely on the nose that you wonder why they didn't just give Candyman a ham for a fist instead of a hook.",Candyman
267,SuperSlim451,Don't say his name.,3,29 August 2021,"Do not say his name that way you don't have to see this crap. The original was so much better. Told a better story. This one was rushed, slapped together with scotch tape, and then put the name Candyman on it to sell it. It did its purpose in selling but it could have been so much better. The killings in it were lackluster in that over half of them you didn't see and for an R rated movie that was very surprising. Why would you give the movie an R rating when half of the killings aren't even shown. And the story of this Candyman was lackluster. It was a good tie in from the first one but that was it. You might as well call this movie Bee Man to be honest. And the ending of the movie was so lackluster you could hear the air come out of the theater as they were so disappointed. Anticlimatic is putting it lightly when it comes to the ending. Its almost a regret seeing this movie. You could see what they were trying to do with some of the things in it but it felt like a political stance at first, racial stance, and then oh yea we have a movie about an iconic character so let's shoehorn him into this.Bee Man should be skipped.

272,zeuthuk,Liberal Masterpiece for the black struggle,6,18 September 2021,Candyman only kills white people.The main characters are black who have been victims of white supremacy.So basically a black person summons Candyman into the neighbourhood who then goes on a murderous rampage only targeting white people.I think the idea is to kill off all the whites so the neighbourhood is returned in full to the black residents. This then removes the white supremacy that has affected the area. Genius idea.If you are white you may find Candyman offensive and at times racist. If you are black you get to see a film that is supportive of the black struggle.Regardless of the political notions this is a popcorn flick that's not particularly scary. If you have nothing to do it's worth watching but not as good as the other films in the franchise.,Candyman
273,fabreetzio,Absolute trash,1,19 September 2021,"One of the worst movies you will ever see. White man bad. Police man bad. No scares, slow as can be. Politically motivated. Rewatch the original instead. Or watch paint dry. Either choice will be 10 times better than this garbage.",Candyman
274,stewiec85,This film is ...interesting,7,29 August 2021,"I admit I didn't know what to expect Bc I was such a fan of the original film and candyman 2. But I will admit I like what they did here which makes it worth watching. Through the story telling sequences they use shadow puppets which I really enjoyed Bc it's something you don't expect to see in a horror movie. Also it touches on the original film and how it plays to this film. It also touches the reason candyman was created Bc of the racism and violence that started it. I also love how personal it was for the people who made this film so like the original it hits you like no other horror film. I also have to comment that there are cheesy scenes like the gay brother cliche and the cliche of the person getting more than they bargained for when they decide to get curious. If you watch closely, you can still watch Tony Todd from the original films appearing. I say if you're a fan of the originals watch it and if you have not seen the originals, this is a good film to make you watch the originals.",Candyman
275,pronuke,Why bother,2,22 October 2021,Another in a series of movies that should have never been made. The first Candy man was a crappy movie. I thought it can't be much worse. I was right but it certainly wasn't any better. I couldn't wait for this to end. Seemed it never would at times. This is a movie that could be improved but honestly it's not really worth the effort.,Candyman
276,mesaxi,I may have been a little generous with 2,2,23 September 2021,"First of all, they baited us with Tony Todd. He was in the movie for 5 seconds. Second of all, if you want to make a movie about how much you hate white people you don't need to hijack a franchise anymore. Netflix will throw money at you. At first I thought the movie was making jokes about rich black artists who make art about oppression while living high on the hog, but when it didn't stop I realized I was in for 2 hours of race bait.",Candyman
277,platon_mp,watchable but uninteresting,6,19 September 2021,"First 30 mins were gorgeous! But the rest felt rushed, like a chapter was missing. The kills were random and the main characters including Candyman himself lacked personality. The only interesting touch was the puppet show scenes. Actually the story that the gay black person tells at the beggining is more engaging and scary than the entire rest of the movie.6 for the effort.",Candyman

The first kill was great and I was excited to see what other creative kills there would be but I was disappointed to learn that pretty much every other kills were off camera.....why? Completely ruined the film for me. The characters were also boring and had no real character development and the ending felt rushed. Terrible film overall and ultimately boring.,Candyman

281,VVirak,A bitter candy,2,19 September 2021,"Remember Voltaire's neither-Holy-nor-Roman-nor-an-Empire take? Well, the new Candyman is a horror movie sequel, except that it isn't really a sequel, nor is it really a horror movie; I'd go even further and state that it's barely a movie, a messy sum of disjointed set pieces that don't work (including the silhouettes bit, yet another fool's gold, along with the hook-and-honey poster, the best thing about this movie). Instead of polishing the rough edges (the origin story never made much sense) and using what functioned so well in 1992 (like, um, the Candyman?), it goes in all directions and, naturally, ends up nowhere because it never knows what it is or what it wants. Ultimately, it's preachy without having anything to say (and there was, a lot). Ignorant audience we are, we can't understand the film language and draw our conclusions from the story itself, we have to be chastised and taught a lesson in terms that have nothing to do with cinema - in fact, the DaCosta-Peel duo (ab)uses the legend/ original treatment to send a message of their own. Also, are we sure that this is a unified front, or is DaCosta Peel's scapegoat to take the blame if the movie bombs while 'A Jordan Peele Film' is there for the accolades? Either way, the final product felt as fake as the Gallery Guy's Joy Division Girl urge (the movie's aversion to Caucasians is so great, not only the few parts it has for them are poorly written, but the creators gave them to a bunch of terrible actors, a dis so splendid one can almost respect that, if only the movie was any good).",Candyman
282,laurainmark,Less of a movie and more of an idea,5,27 August 2021,"The film starts out by telling the original story reversed, with Helen being the monster. Then we get a different version where she was simply investigating an event that had not yet happened.During the course of things. ""Candyman"" goes from being a metaphor for violence, then onward to being philosophical as being the monster within us all.At times,he appears as a distorted reflection of the viewer,
At other times. He is an invisible ghost.After 5 different contradictory versions of Candyman, we meet the grown infant from the original and are presented with a story wherein Candyman is a creature born of his tortured mind as his art project.Finally. We get Tony Todd summoned in his original Candyman form. But declaring that he is now a crusader for social justice.I am 100% behind social reform and social justice. But the message is delivered in such a convoluted manner as to be ineffective or flat-out pandering and beneath the dignity that the message deserves.If you are an unmedicated schizophrenic with no sense of linear time or object permanence then you might enjoy and follow this as a slasher film.Otherwise, go in viewing it as an experimental arthouse piece presenting ideas for discussion lest you get lost in candyman alternating from literal, figurative. Metaphorical, and philosophical.Not a complete waste. But not a horror/slasher either.Candyman is just a bait and switch to present ideas.",Candyman

284,bozabozidar,Candyman returns to Chicago to jump the shark,5,29 August 2021,"Unlike the two cheesy B slasher flicks from 1995 and 1999, the new Candyman is a direct sequel to the 1992 original, set at the same place and even featuring some of the same characters. It also serves as a prequel, since there are a few scenes taking place before the original film, with the purpose to expand the backstory of the titular villain. The new Candyman also takes on the political overtones from the original, though one could say that this aspect is controversial and greatly exaggerated, with too many ""stick it to the Man"" moments. Anyhow, the first Candyman movie of the 21st century is much more of a blunt social critique than a horror movie. The kill count is astronomically high, but most of the deaths are off-screen, and it's like the whole movie merely tries to be as exaggerated and over-the-top as possible while not being scary at all. In fact, there are some scenes that go beyond the normal suspension of belief by just how absurd they are, and near the ending it seems like the movie has ""jumped the shark"" due to how over-the-top the finale is. All of the characters are very forgettable, and most of them serve no other purpose other than to get killed. The thing I personally dislike the most are the annoying flashing lights featured heavily in one scene.However, the flashback scenes done in shadow puppetry are excellent and mesmerizing. The last scene with shadow puppets accompanies the end credits, and it might even be the best scene of the whole movie.",Candyman

Overall, very, very bad and forgettable movie.Final score: 3-4/10.",Candyman
287,jcsallows,I enjoyed this more than I thought I would,8,29 August 2021,"I haven't watched the original Candyman nor it's sequels but saw this movie's trailers, then learned Jordan Peele was involved and immediately jumped on. I also think Yahya is great on screen, when I saw him as Black Manta in the Aquaman movie.People are complaining that the political commentary is being shoved down their throat, and if you're sensitive to that; you should probably stay away (unless you want to ""Hate Watch"" this movie). Even though I'm not familiar with the Candyman franchise, I know enough that it's generally about the social injustices of black communities in America. I think some people are wanting to see another slasher flick and getting dissapointed when they leave the theater (or watch it at home).As a social commentary, I really enjoyed this film. There were two scenes in this movie which communicates what this movie is about. The main character is an artist and starts painting depictions of police brutality; the critics around him (including his girlfriend) comment that it's too literal, surface level and has no room for interpretation. His art isn't anything we haven't seen before.I think that's what this movie is. This isn't about censoring the social commentary, being nuanced or metaphorical because what's left to hide anymore? We all already know how the police treat black people in poor neighborhoods. This movie tries to address the endless cycle of hatred, voilence and ""us versus them"" that we accept as normal aspects of society and our own communal histories. Something has to give and that something is the antogonist of Candyman.There's also criticism that the third act was rushed which I agree. It's not so bad that you don't understand what's happening but it does move quickly. I hope, if there's a director's cut, they extend the third act. I never thought I'd ask for more exposition in a slasher film.Also, don't watch the trailers, just watch this movie. The trailers unfortunately spoil most of the good shots and even some plot twists. This is well written, acted and directed. I don't see any major flaws here only that there could have been more worldbuilding and exposition.",Candyman
288,natepauley,Artistically Derivative,7,20 September 2021,"It dissects a lot of important issues worth consideration; and is backed up by noteworthy cinematography and stellar acting.While it fundamentally does this; you can't help but consider if it's an interpretation of its originated material.It's represents an artistic form of work that forces you to linger on its messages, while effective - anyone that is seeking original horror methodology may just be disappointed.",Candyman
289,DinosaurAct86,Seamless expansion of the original,9,28 August 2021,"Without spoiling a thing, I firmly believe that DaCosta's Candyman is a seamless expansion of the original. Its successful dread just seeps through thanks to great execution of acting, cinematography, and score. Overall, it is a near-perfect horror film evoking the horrors of history and the bloodlust that history could awaken...Many reviewers that complain of the ""woke"" elements are neglecting the truth that the original Candyman is set in the REAL neglected neighborhood of Cabrini Green, where the black community is suffering and all but hemmed-in by abject poverty. Helen Lyle essentially comes in as a naive, white academic that eventually becomes as engrained in the mystery she's pursuing as the titular character, who (as then-slave Daniel Robitalle)was originally murdered and mutilated by white men for daring to love a white woman. His ghost spends eternity getting vengeance. Therefore social justice is at the heart of the original story. It is not out of place in this one.This film is set in a gentrified Cabrini Green, where Candyman has not disappeared at all. Without going into more detail, I will say that Daniel Robitalle might not be the only Candyman...See this if you love GREAT horror like The Babadook, The Shining, The VVitch, Get Out, and Rosemary's Baby. Form your own opinion based on the film's horror merits. I personally think DaCosta has a bright future!",Candyman

I gave it a shot because it's written and produced by Jordan Peele and despite the (what I consider to be) failures of ""Us"" and ""The Twilight Zone"", I still have high hopes that he'll achieve greatness beyond his sophomore films. I've had him shortlisted as one of the most promising new directors currently working. Here's to hoping he gets better. You can see the love he has for this genre of film, but he's slowly showing his inexperience in writing them. I'm still looking forward to Nope, but with each new sub par entry in his catalogue, my excitement evaporates a little bit more.",Candyman
294,mackcrocker,My thoughts,7,27 August 2021,"Here are my thoughts on Candyman. I have mixed feelings in this movie. I loved the original with Tony Todd and that movie is a great horror movie and it had great social commentary. Having said that this new film is set in the same universe as that film which would have been great if not for some pretty bad acting, and some twists I saw coming which isn't Necessarily a bad thing but it became very predictable. I loved all the references to the first movie. That was a really nice touch. I loved some of the camera work and it had some really cool shots. It had some really gory kills that really made it feel like the original. I loved all the mirror angles and how the shots made it look like it was shot through a mirror and how you only see candyman through mirrors. I thought some of the comedy was really hit or miss but it over all got a few laughs out of me. Jordan Peele writing really shows in this movie and the little scenes of comedy throughout. Where the movie really misses with me is the social commentary. I really think the original had a good balance between the slasher horror and the social commentary. This was really bland and it does show a lot of what happens nowadays but I just think they push too hard with all the social criticisms. I really didn't like this version of candy man he just wasn't a screen presence like Tony Todd was and he was just creepy and not intimidating. There are also a lot of plot threads that don't get resolved or just don't mean anything to the story which really didn't make that much sense to me. It's a very artsy horror movie which really made me just wanting something more like the first movie. I do want to add that there is something that happens at the end I won't spoiler but I thought it was really awesome and you should really enjoy that. I'm going to give Candyman a 7.5/10. I may end up doing a review of the original Candyman so let me know if that is something you would want.",Candyman
295,godmschick,Excellent continuation of the first film and the saga,10,11 October 2021,"A fantastic film. This was an excellent continuation of the best parts of the first candyman from the early 90s. The film makers nailed the script, made it relevant to today and every day of the past... and also told a compelling story with realistic characters fully formed. Production value is amazing. Cinematography is Oscar worthy. And the performances are sincere and palpable.Honestly, I was expecting a lecture... and instead I got an essay... this was brilliant and poignant and beautiful. This is why I love the horror genre, you can tell stories (or stories about telling stories) in a way no other genre can. Effective and powerful.",Candyman
296,thomasalexanderdamienoma,This could of been so much better.,5,29 August 2021,I love the massive amounts of references in this film to the original one and how you slow piece together the connection. Where it all falls apart is where all white people and police are bad. As specially at the end how the main character got shot it's almost straight out of a comedy. Where a someone says hi to the cop and 20 of them light him up. Then the bit with the force confession. It got really silly really quickly at the end and I was very disappointed. A lot of the we hate white people stuff could of been left out.If you like all the references to the original and a interesting twist on the belief which I kind of thought was the case with the original then give this one a watch. I'll happily watch this one over the third. But it's nothing compared to the original and the second one is much better.,Candyman

Altough the plot has a lot of potentials the final product is filled with pointless cliches. But it is such a boring film. Also what makes this a terrible film is comes from director's signature habit. Peele likes his plots dipped in poliitics. This time it is unbearable.

308,u-noe-mi-naim,Was a sequel really needed?,7,30 August 2021,"The OG Candyman was directed by Bernard Rose, the script created from a short story written by Clive Barker, and the protagonist of this horror is a red haired, blue/green eyed woman and the tale takes place in Chicago's Cabrini-Green. Rose decided his 1992 horror story's themes would be of race and social class, plus unlike the locale of the the short-story it would take place in the inner-city. This was the original films idea... though its screenplay was drafted by people who live a different reality far from those of Cabrini-Green. The POV of the original movie was even from the perspective of a person who's reality differed from those who lived in this urban housing project. This film plays on middle-class uber fears of racial stereotypes. Candyman was tortured and killed by a anger mob because of a taboo affair, but his vengeful spirit vented its rage against people who look like him, there was a mutual obsession between Candyman and the fair redheaded woman who pull him into her ""world"" now endangering people who look like her. The first movie is unabashedly offensive and now since the quote on quote direct sequel is being told through a new colored lense which does not use the tropes of the original it's being judged badly because its believed that the director: Nia DaCosta, and executive producers: Ian Cooper; Win Rosenfeld; Jordan Peele has a political BLM or woke agenda. Though the first movie's director, Bernard Rose, literally was calling out attention to the social disparities and the extreme wealth gap between suburban and urban societies in America. He did used the predominant's film goers opined imagination to twine together a movie that was only scary to those who accepted the aforementioned race stereotypes. Using ""woke"" and BLM as reason to why you were unsatisfied with this movie paints you in a bad light.

That's all.I remember when horror slasher movies was all about vindictive character (human, ghost, spirit, whatever) killing everyone without reason, and while this movie contains some of that juicy slash, the social commentary included in the dialogue is annoying and distracting. It's always black this, white that, what's this movie's purpose, really? I don't know. The story doesn't really feel coherent or even engaging. The jumpscare wasn't really there, the slasher happened mostly off screen and only partially visible most of the time. I was actually grateful because I can't really watch the gory part of any slasher movie, but I could always close my eyes when I don't want to see, but this movie didn't even give me that option because there wasn't much to see to begin with.And let's not talk about the conclusion, because I don't think there's even any. I left the theater even more annoyed and craving more of the old Candyman. Yea, let's do that. Forget this annoying piece of mess and watch the good ol' 90s. Shoulda known better than to throw money on some reboot. At least the cream cheese pretzel that was only sold at the particular theater I was watching at was delicious.",Candyman
312,brionesb,Wish I could say this sequel/reboot is better than it turned out being...,5,27 August 2021,"Unfortunately & somewhat (un)surprisingly, I was a bit disappointed in this quasi-sequel/reboot. The new movie is quite faithful & even builds on the original 1992 film, but at the end of the day it feels like a woke-ish retelling of it too.Why I think the original works so much better IMHO is that the director, Bernard Rose, leaned into the urban legend aspects of the original short story by Clive Barker. I think the decision to focus on having the main character, Helen, learn of & explore the legend of Candyman did a lot to engage the audience as well as play into our skepticism of whether or not we believe he is real or a bogeyman. The plot of the original does toy with what we're seeing through Helen's and makes us question of what we're seeing with her is real or her getting drawn too far down the rabbit hole.In this new movie, our new protagonist, Anthony, literally goes through the motions of learning about & being drawn into the myth of the Candyman but it doesn't feel quite right. Instead, it feels more like the character is literally going through the motions & only being further drawn in because the plot says that is what is supposed to happen.Perhaps in spite of what I think is arguably a major issue with the new film, maybe those who were never exposed to the original film will find it to be decent. Overall, the movie does a mostly good job of avoiding the usual modern horror movie tropes of jump scares galore & gore everywhere but this unfortunately a very low bar if we're using that as a measurement of how great it is. If you've seen the original film, I think you will be mostly disappointed as there is really nothing new being added here & you'd be much better off watching that movie than this.",Candyman

Of course being a modern remake/sequal there must be a heavy social political message, but I had a concussion with how heavy handed this film was.

317,silversurfer-98560,Towards the end.,4,21 September 2021,"Towards the end it got better. But the beginning was about wokeness and racism towards white people. Example, blaming white people in general for the way the hood looks. No Keenan, it is that way because of the black and white people you voted for decades for. Should have stuck to the storyline and left politics out of it.",Candyman
318,medusiac,"""Horror"" with zero atmosphere, unwarranted okayish ending",2,23 September 2021,"I'm not sure how one can make a horror movie this devoid of any kind of atmosphere. For the most part, the film is a blank slate. There's NOTHING you feel about ANYTHING happening on the screen.My wife and I watched it for 45 minutes and she couldn't stand it anymore cause she was bored.When the ""horror"" kicked in, the characters started having these ludicrous reactions that were one of the three:
a) staring at the supernatural thing as if it's a curious stone that you're researching and not something to scare the hell out of you
b) having a blank stare as if no one told the actor they were NOT looking at a green screen
c) yelling stupid things that are supposed to be humorous, which has no place in this kind of movieWith zero atmosphere, there's zero tension. The violence is silly cause Candyman, for the most part, remains invisible. Seeing people thrown around and killed with a hook without, like, actually seeing it, tones the horror further down and makes it look like a dull gimmick.Now, I did skim the rest of the movie, and I have to say that what I've seen of the ending is actually okayish. Too on the nose, predictable, and silly, but somewhat alright. It's a shame that the rest of the movie doesn't warrant such an ending.All in all, the best solution when it comes to Candyman is reading the story. I didn't like the original film because it devolved into a cliche and threw what was cool about the story's ending out the window. This sequel didn't do anything better - in fact, it did it worse.Also, as far as I remember, the part about saying Candyman five times in the mirror was NOT in the original story. The whole Bloody Mary ripoff crap was thrown in by Hollywood, and frankly, any Candyman interpretation would have been better off without it.A hard skip on this one, as it's a huge waste of time, even with the runtime of about 1h30min, and an ending that is soooooooooomewhat ok. It's not worth it.",Candyman
319,pcytoman,"Cannot compare to the original 1992 Candyman,",4,26 August 2021,"I watched the movie at a free screening. I was somewhat let down by this sequel. It was extremely heavy handed with sociopolitical commentaries regarding police brutality and gentrification if that is what you are looking for. The movie panders more for the ""woke"" crowd. The original film handled the issue of race in a more subtle way and had at its' heart, a tragic love story. Tony Todd as Candyman was a compelling and tragic villain. Virginia Madsen was also great as Helen Lyle. Of course the score by composer Philip Glass was stunning and iconic. Unfortunately Tony Todd only appears briefly for a few seconds in this sequel.This sequel was well shot and had funny moments, but ultimately left me disappointed. While the acting was decent, none of the characters were compelling to me.",Candyman
320,chevelle-57843,I loved it,8,6 September 2021,"Let's start out with the negative comments I have: a lot of the horror was off screen. I would have liked to see more of it. I know that's most likely the point of the villain, to have him be elusive.It came off as a bit anti police, which, with the state of the world, I get it. But, every single cop in this movie are just... evil to the core.That being said, I loved this movie. It tied in well with the first movie. The actors were great, especially the two leads. The psychological body horror were enough to make me feel scared. I like the backstop of the characters. I would definitely watch it again.I think it's worth a watch. Fom your own opinion on it.",Candyman

327,Harkonnen2,About on par with the other Candyman Sequels,4,26 August 2021,"The movie has an interesting premise and connection to the original film which had me interested way back when it was originally suppose to come out.Unfortunately not only does it not live up to the Original it only barely manages to match the 2 previous sequels (Farewell to the flesh and Day of the dead). Probably the most glaring especially for anyone that remembers the original is this one lacks the commanding and incredible presence Tony Todd brought to the role of Candyman, whenever he was on screen was amazing. It also tries to expand the mythology of Candyman but it doesn't land right either similar to how each sequel gave Candyman a new weakness and vulnerability. There is also way to many moments in the film
where all these things are happening to or around the main character and you are getting tiny glimpses of there impacts but they seem separate from the main character like there are no consequences.The Police are also a glaring issue in this as the movie wants to paint there attitude a certain way yet at the same time ignore that attitude and the effects it would have on the story when its convenient to do soOverall not a terrible movie but very lackluster, at best it will make you want to rewatch the original again.",Candyman
328,TerminatorVentilador,Not very good at all.,2,29 August 2021,"While it was interesting to see the tie-ins with the original movie and the return of certain characters, the writing as a whole ended up being a convoluted mess (including heavy-handed ""social commentary"" that was ridiculously over the top) that fundamentally disrespects the original film. Tony Todd is only in here for like ... two seconds and has one line. That's it. Blehhhh.",Candyman

Good start, draggy middle act, and so-so finale. A forgettable treat. Should watch the original instead.",Candyman
330,socialsunshine-12645,Complicated feelings about the film,5,3 November 2021,"First off I will say I like the fact that this franchise has really given us an opportunity to see Black horror on the mainstream/big screen. Most western horror movies are based on Eurocentric based fears/concepts and only showcase white people (with the exception of the ONE Black friend who gets killed first in the group). Films like Candyman give African Americans/Black people a narrative and represents the fears/horrors that are real to us. That being said, I had an issue with the movie's message. Like Candyman is created because of the white supremacy/violence that has been perpetuated in this country for the past several centuries. Since he is an entity that's a culmination of Black suffering, why does he mainly terrorize his own community?? I don't understand why this character would not use his persuasion to infiltrate the leaders of the carceral system so that he can put an end to the police/corrupt legal system. What does he gain from primarily staying within poor Black neighborhoods and mostly killing adolescents who simply want to play a ""game""/test a superstitious tale? I feel like the message was lost because he had no real motive for most of his killings.Also, honestly I hate that every Black film/series has to include police shootings. It's overdone and it always feels rushed/out of place in the story. Like there are other ways that Black people suffer/experience racism, so why is the focus ONLY on that? Seems like a cheap shot...Additionally the film had weird pacing. Like on one hand it feels like the story was going by really fast without any real background or buildup, but at the same time so many plot points felt so drawn out and slow. The main character wasnt given enough depth for me to care too much about what happened to him. Also, it was obvious from the start that he was going to become the next candyman, so there was no real suspense.Lastly, the movie kind of went back on its own rules. In some death scenes everyone who was in the room/vicinity with the person who summoned CM was murdered but in other cases, only the summoners died. Also, i dont get how CM was setting the main character up to be his successor, yet he tried to have him killed as an infant??In conclusion the film was ok but I think a bit more thought should have been put into the plot.",Candyman
331,tmcmaster-67512,Stop Deleting my Review,1,15 October 2021,I had 3 different reviews for this horrible mess taken down. WORST FILM OF 2021. I can't remember my entire review but the story in this film is so pretentious and awful I thought about leaving. Instead I just rolled with it and laughed at how absurd it all was. I don't what anyone was thinking that had part in writing or editing this garbage. Let's see this review also get deleted.,Candyman
332,johnsonpace,Worst movie I've seen all year,3,4 September 2021,"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh on the movie but I really expected more from Jordan. Get out was a great movie in many ways. Us had its flaws and was disliked by many but I still enjoyed the movie greatly. Candyman however I didn't enjoy at all. Listen people there is a time and place to discuss political beliefs. That time and place is not In the re imagining of a popular horror movie. I have no issues with politics in movies, I have a problem when they take sides in politics in movies. Even when they are taking the side of things I believe in, it has me rolling my eyes in the theater which was the unfortunate case in this movie. Even without the propaganda, the writing is a total mess. The concept was nice, watching a man get driven into more and more of a mentally unstable state while studying the subject of the Candyman and not so subtly hinting at the fact that he is transforming into the candyman. However the entire plot of the movie hinges on a story the comic relief character told in the first 10 minutes of the movie, the main character becoming the Candyman was hinted at so unsubtly they might as well said it happens in the advertisements, all the victims the audience doesn't like to begin with so there's no intensity, and in the last 10 minutes of the movie they pull a main villain out of their ass. This movie is beyond disappointing and it's such a shame because I know Jordan Is capable of writing more than competent movies. But In this case he just chose not to.",Candyman

But no, I actually loved this movie alot. In my opinion it's the best horror movie of 2021 so far, and yes I know ALOT of you are going to disagree but this is just my opinion.The movie kept my interest from start to finish. The musical score, cinematography and acting were all great. The horror moments were very effective, creepy and well done. Candyman is more of a shadow in the corner than the boogeyman all up in your face, which actuall made him more menacing. The climax isn't a big eye full off thrills but was satisfying enough.I will say the only negative thing about the film was the lack of Tony Todd as he only makes a cameo, but even with his limited screen time, it works well with the story telling and sets up for a sequel where we could see him in his full glory.",Candyman

If you rated the orginal Candyman highly and thought it wasn't racial or political, you missed the point by several miles.Rather than being the remake or reboot I expected, this new Candyman is a direct sequel to the first film. That being said, it does venture into some completely new avenues.I have to admit, I didn't have hign hopes going in to this film, but it really exceeded my expectations.

I liked how it was going so far, the beginning was great. However, it started getting too political and felt like they were pushing the BLM movement onto the film. Every white person apart from the brothers lover were evil. Were racist. You felt attacked and shameful of your own race. Is that the message they want everyone to feel? That every white person are horrible racists? I felt it was the wrong message. Are we all to be tarred by the same brush? You felt damn I was only wanting to watch a fun horror movie.Also a lot of the deaths were off screen. It's a shame as it didn't make as much of an impact. There was no scare factor, no tension. He didn't scare me when he came on screen whereas Tony Todd called for your attention and he damn well got it. It was nice to see a cameo but by then the film was done. He was a fantastic Candyman.

It was just forgettable for me. This one, on the other hand, is more than just a horror movie. You leave the theater thinking about all the underlying themes in the movie & how important they are to discuss & how nice it is to have a movie explore them. Jordan Peele has gained my attention for the rest of his career from Get Out alone, but he has yet to make even a mediocre film as all he has made are exceptional pieces of cinema & Candyman is no different in that regard. My ONLY complaint about the film is the kills weren't as graphic as I would've liked, but it is such a minor gripe that it shouldn't be taken into account. Go see this movie & let's all have an important discussion about the messages behind it.Also, ignore any review below a 7 on IMDB.

If the title was changed I feel people would accept this film for what it is.The film was beautiful and touches on very real issues. Anyone with half a brain could enjoy this film. The actors were superb and the story was well put together. You will go home talking about the movie the entire way.My only complaint is it gets into the ""ACAB"" area which can be tricky especially with recent events. That is why I cant give it a perfect rating since I feel the writers of the film should have some onus on them to make that clear. As not all people are bad from any given race.Other wise beautifully shot and well thought out. I look forward to Jordan Peeles ""Nope"" next.",Candyman
353,hannah-mae91,"Not perfect, but definitely worth a watch if you don't get annoyed with political horror.",7,27 August 2021,"I'm split on this movie. I wish it had taken more time to explore the characters before things started to hit the fan. The girlfriend, for instance, has a fascinating backstory that's given a couple times but never resolved. And I couldn't get a read on the main character's feelings about what was going on around him. I also felt the two scenes with teens/children confused the messaging. If they were going for a political commentary, these kids detracted from that. I thought for a moment the movie was going for a cursed videotape type ending, but I guess not? But also sort of?What I did like was the acting, the conversation it had with itself, the striking visual moments, the paper cutout scenes, and the use of mirrors. I also like that it maintained the political commentary of the original and built on top of it. That wasn't a surprise since Jordan Peele was involved, but I'm still glad it wasn't a remake just for the sake of a remake. I also really enjoyed the use of the first film's story in this one. I caught on to what they were doing early on due to having just watched the first one and remembering names, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The scares were effective and there weren't any obnoxious jump scares. There's a moment in the back of the car where the dread and tension built quite nicely. (The way that scene ended didn't quite make sense but it was cool so whatever.)Ultimately this is a flawed movie that comes from a good place and has moments of deft handling of both the horror genre and of complex political commentary. Pairs well with the first one and has genuinely creepy moments (wall guy, anyone?)",Candyman

355,mjlyl1982,Ok but not what it had the potential to bee. (See what I did there?).,6,31 August 2021,"Overall:1. Cinematography - Great2. Sound + Mix - Great3. Score - Great4. Acting - Great5. Story - Good6. Pacing - Good for the first 2/3rds, last 3rd felt rushed7. Effects - Great in some scenes (killing of the critic wide shot, elevator scene, Candyman only visible in the mirror), bad in others (screen shearing, bee on compact mirror in bathroom, Daniel Robitaille face - all looked amateur/unconvincing). In my opinion, CG is good only when you can tell it's not being used.Some things that wowed me as a fan of the original:1. A nod to Phillip Glass' original score2. The puppetry incorporation3. Seeing Vanessa Williams again (does she age?!)4. The incorporating of audio from the first film plus new dialog for Helen LyleSome things that plagued the movie in more detail:1. The movie seemed to be missing important plot points (for example - why did Brianna see Daniel Robitaille? Was there a connection to her father's backstory that didn't make the final cut? Also, Anthony/Ruthie Jean's scene felt rushed).2. The scene of the girls in the bathroom felt superfluous and unneeded.3. Why did no one bring up Anthony's hand sooner?4. The gay sass. I am gay and love sass but this was a serious, brooding movie and didn't need it - it didn't suit the intended tone. (I did love Brianna's ""nope"" though which is the same reaction I'd have and obviously a nod to Jordan Peele's upcoming 2022 movie of the same name).When we as fans see issues like this, often times the culprit tends to be budget or studio interference. It is very difficult to take an existing piece of well loved IP and come up with a compelling sequel. Mike Flanagan managed to pull this off with ""Doctor Sleep"" and I feel like Nia tried her best (and succeeded in many regards) but maybe wasn't given the runway she needed? I feel like there is lots of stuff on the cutting room floor.I am being especially critical of this movie as it was delayed almost a year due to the pandemic - these issues could have been addressed with a few small reshoots during that time. I really hope we get to see a proper director's cut in time.Re: the socio-political commentary people raise - at first I recoiled (I am a cisgendered white gay male) but then remembered that brutal police killings of black people continue to happen all the time - there is no point in sheltering audiences from reality. And to those who say no black people died - were you watching the same movie? William Burke's sister was killed, so was he, Sherman and ultimately Anthony - not ""nicely"" either.I will re-watch this again when it's out on VOD to see if I missed anything the first time around.

360,Shazam1303,Sloppy and rushed Editing ruined it for me,6,26 August 2021,"I was traumatized by the first two Candyman Movies as a child. Something that has stuck with me through the years. I went in super nervous and expected to be reminded of the trauma I once had. But after the movie was over I felt more like my trauma was healed. I felt relieved. Because of the social commentaries and the focus this movie has, it kind of shy's away from the intense horror and goes more into themes of trauma and social injustice. I went in expecting to be frightened but got more of a drama about the traumas of a black man in America (which I am by the way, so I could connect to a lot of topics). Those topics are frightening if you can really relate to them. So kudos for talking about important things, but the Candyman used to strike way more fear into me. This movie just didn't do and responsible to me are certain decisions that the director and team made... The movie felt rushed and a lot of scenes didn't make sense. You don't know why certain characters choose certain actions and therefor the movie is full of plot holes and unrealistic behavior. The kills are just not frightening because you don't feel for the characters that are killed. They just appear in the movie to be killed. There's nothing personal to these characters and the main plot. There's just not enough time built to invest in them and what happens to them. And the Candyman just didn't seem scary to me. Neither did his look or the way they staged the kills. I really don't want to spoil anything but it's hard to get into the issues without details.But put it like this...My Wife, which is usually scared of horror movies and hates me for a week, after I take her to one, left the theater loving the movie and not scared at all. She complimented the movie and the topics and felt sad...not scared.So yeah! Maybe this comment will help you to set the right expectations.I hope we get another sequel because this movie gave me tones of ideas where you can take the future of the franchise and I really want them to take the movie into scarier and more intense directions than this.",Candyman

This new Candyman is a good interesting film overall, but it shys away from certain sequences that moviegoers look for when they go to see a horror film. Specifically a scene in which High school friends summon Candyman, but once he shows up and attacks these teens most of the sequence is off camera which is disappointing for a horror film that's supposed to be R rated. Apart from that, the cinematography in this movie is amazing! The camera angles and the use of mirrors in this film was very clever, and certain sequences were definitely inspired by A Nightmare on Elm Street. The storyline kept me invested and flowed well. This is a movie I do recommend for anyone who saw the original Candyman. This film does link with the original and I believe it was done very well.",Candyman

364,darcynader,Don't expect the trailer,8,20 September 2021,"Really doesn't deserve the review bombing it's been recieving. Yes, the film does have a political & social message. Yes, it can be heavy at times. However, it's really not the worst for it. A traditional horror film, this is not. It's more of a suspense film, with a message and horrific scenes. Well acted, well paced, beautifully shot and composed. While the Twitter was great, it certainly did this film a disservice, as it isn't the film that was advertised. Instead, the film is a tense, poignant, unflinching expansion of an interesting mythology and a slightly fresh take on an often tired genre. If you're up for horror with a little depth, a little self awareness, a little more style, this is a great film to give a chance to. If you're hung up on white guilt, or can't handle loose examinations of racial issues, then perhaps give this a pass.",Candyman
365,rib_eye,Much deeper than just your typical horror film,9,27 August 2021,"I'm seriously blown away by the new Candyman movie, it's one of the best horror films I've seen in a while and I watch horror often. Everything from the acting, cinematography, character development, social commentary, and of course the kills are all top notch and incredibly interesting. It is a direct sequel to the first film from 1992 and how Nia DaCosta and Jordan Peele expand on the lore already established in that film is brilliant and paints a broader, more elaborate picture than what the first one only touched on. Plus, telling much of that story by way of shadow puppets really sets a dark feel and tone for how things play out. I haven't left the theater after watching a horror flick feeling uneasy in a long time and this one did just that. I understand with delta going around people don't want to risk going to the theater, but if you're able to I can't recommend enough going and experiencing this one on the big screen. I loved it.",Candyman
366,gabrielgarbagni,You will remember his name,8,26 August 2021,"Candyman is the type of movie that both surprises you and makes you think. Nia DaCosta does a great job at crafting a story which is engaging, fresh and full of twists and turns. The atmosphere, in particular, is what makes the experience deep and captivating. On top of that, the script manages to represent current social problems in a way that makes the viewer question the moral aspects of the story. Even if it's not perfect, this movie is one of the greatest thrillers I had the chance to see in recent years.",Candyman
367,minabasejderha,This is being review-bombed,10,29 August 2021,"It's a good film. And I enjoyed it quite a bit. Peele was one of the screenwriters, but he was not directing on this one. Up 'til now, I was basically only familiar with his comedy, but I will be giving Get Out and Us a watch some time soonish.As for what else I said, this is almost certainly being review-bombed by people with petty disagreements with Peele's politics, as with the politics of the film more broadly. They seem to think the *coughs* 'woke' racial message of this film is something the film added. And that's correct. The 1992 film DID add the woke racial message to Clive Barker's story, which was instead about social class in England. But the 2021 film definitively did not. If you don't remember, watch it again. You must have missed it. Regardless, if you are upset that the film is about a ghost of a man who was lynched and now seeking revenge, you have the 1992 film to blame.This film maybe does has a more nuanced take on issues of housing discrimination and gentrification (my field of study) than the original, but that's because the actual historical and sociological writing on gentrification advanced in the last 30 years, and the 2021 film (surprisingly) kept up with current research.Yes, the film is racially conscious. Yes, it has interesting things to say on the matter. But no, it is not anti-white. There is a singular joke at white-people's expence, and it is just that the black characters are much more cautious than the white ones, and they consequently live longer.What IS the film's political message, then? Well, a couple of scenes, one early on and one toward the end, depict the police as trigger-happy. The latter of the two depicts that they will lie and cover up each other's mistakes, and pressure witnesses into backing them up. This is called the ""blue-wall of silence"", a well-documented phenomenon that even some ex-police have complained about, saying they were bullied into playing along.I would not say this is the ""point"" of the film, but it is a clear perspective that the film has. It is a secondary point to the main characters' stories. You can easily enjoy this movie even if you disagree with it's politics. If it helps, just tell yourself the police in this movie were bad apples.",Candyman
368,kozakiew,Surprisingly thoughtful,8,12 September 2021,"I went in with very low expectations. I've seen some of the older films and they have at best some good visuals and some good ideas. However I think this movie combined both the visceral violence that stems from the main characters backstory, and also some thought-provoking ideas about how that applies to our society today. I hope that Jordan Peele will keep doing this type of work, and if some of you think this was a miss, fine. I'm a big fan of Martin Scorsese, Sergio Leone, Ingmar Bergman, Coppola and many other fine directors and producers. And they all have misses. So if you think this is a Jordan Peele miss, give him another try. And remember, this was him producing and not directing. Though I do think the Director was fine. On a final note, I'm just happy to be back in a theater being able to watch movies on the big screen.",Candyman
369,megmazzi,Worth a watch,7,19 September 2021,"Not a perfect movie, the ending feels like a scene was missing and it was put together quickly. But, it's still worth a watch. Reminded me of the shining with how specific colors were used in each scene throughout the movie. I feel bad for the other reviewers who missed the memo on what the first movie was about, and how, fast forward, racial injustice still exists in the community and around the community. Interesting progression of the story, told from the perspective of people of color. Subtle horror, decent gore, a little in your face with the cops but that's to be expected with this story. It's a time capsule for today, it's relevant; it's not just a slasher...which seems like what a lot of people expected.",Candyman
370,awesome-21765,Unnecessary humour ruins it for me,4,26 August 2021,"Most of the horror movies that we get today aren't even horror movies, they are just comedy movies with horror elements that you find most of the audiences in theaters are laughing instead of feeling scared supposedly. But I, on the other hand, understand that it takes a huge effort and creativity to come up with an actual scary horror movie, and that's why writers and producers tend to stuff comedy into their horror projects so that they aren't taken seriously and criticized harshly.Comedy should have no place in horror movies PERIOD, that comic relief approach worked for ""get out"" because the concept of the movie allowed some room for that, it didn't work for ""US"" and made it forgettable and silly for an otherwise original movie, and i see that it ruined the total atmosphere in CANDYMAN.Spoilers:- This movie is just about random stupid people saying Candyman in front of mirror to get themselves killed, nothing more and nothing less. The whole evil thing could've been avoided had they just lived their lives like normal human beings with functional brains.Quite frankly, the plot device is itself really stupid. Why would people summon an evil that just eliminates everything in its way? I mean people normally would conjure something that fulfills dreams and wishes, but definitely not something like Candyman, whom they actually knew that it is a very ruthless and deadly spirit. But again, I'll show some understanding for that part also, because horror movies should always have stupid people.Characters: all of them are stupid with unlikeable personality, let alone the cheesy acting.How many times do we have to watch ""stupid teens summoning evil spirits in schools""? Seriously get rid of that cliche!",Candyman
371,stevovt,Not As Bad as the reviews,8,29 August 2021,"Look, I bought a ticket to this ahead of time and then read these IMDb reviews calling this movie a ""woke political statement"", it's far from this. This is a spiritual take on the legend that just fills in the gaps presented in the original. The same plot and ""woke nonsense"" a lot of the likely bigots leaving reviews on here is the same as original.Don't let the racist viewers dissuade you from seeing this; it's a great flick and I only give it a 9 because there's like 5 seconds of Tony Todd.",Candyman

Is it better than the original? No, but its not trying to be. This movie dives into the importance of the underlaying meaning of it all. I'm shocked to read people call this ""racism being pushed in their faces"" when the way people get treated in the movie is not far of from actual reality. That is HORROR. Would I have liked for this to have been more horror in the blood spilling creepier way? Definitely, but that was not the point of this one. And im totally okay with that. Please consider watching it and not only basing the decision on these 2 and 3 star reviews.",Candyman
374,lisakelendria-54906,Boring,1,9 October 2021,"I was eager to see this as an original Candyman fan, but wish I hadn't bothered. The dialogues were long, overused and boring, there's no depths or likability to the characters and the forced political messages were done to death (Pun intended) I was excited especially to see Tony Todd reprising his role, only for him to be in it at the very end, and having another Candyman in his place was confusing as hell. The only good points were Tony Todd and Vanessa Williams reprising their roles, shame they weren't in it longer. They might as well have brought back Virginia Madsen, at least it would've been more interesting.",Candyman
375,fleshwounddan,Pretty much exactly what you expect it to be,1,27 August 2021,"I am a huge fan of the original Candyman, and the short story, The Forbidden by Clive Barker, and find most people don't understand the original film at all. For me this new film misses the mark in almost every way, although I will give some credit for a couple cool visuals.The original movie felt like you were experiencing a living nightmare, and this modern setting absolutely killed most of the mood and suspense. Also, they gloss over some key elements that might have made it more interesting. For any of you gore hounds I'm afraid it's all mostly off screen or out of focus.In short you get the stereotypical evil cops, and self centered white city folk, and things play out exactly as you'd expect. The expansion of the lore will be hit or miss for fans, but as I said many don't understand what happens in the 1992 film anyway.At least it's better than Candyman 3.....but only barely.",Candyman
376,christwond,Classic Horror was used for White People Bad Propaganda,1,17 September 2021,"Very disappointed. First of all the Original Candyman (1992) does have the topic of the wealthy white, so I did expect it to be part of this new remake as well. But instead of including the history of America as Part of the Candyman character for the plot sake, this movie used this classic story to produce a political statement and barely focused on the cinematic aspect of the original candyman. The only reason why the genre is considered horror is because of the franchise but in fact it's a political thriller nothing more.The reason I gave a 1 start rating is not because the movie is bad, but because this production has mislead the audience in making them believe to receive a new candyman horror movie but end up using one of the most popular horror stories to be able to spread their message on as many people as possible. This is the definition of propaganda.I don't want to go to a Harry Potter remake and notice that they only did it to educate me about racial problems.This movie was a low move by Hollywood.",Candyman
377,LadyDerpyCritic,Candyman makes the movie solid good,6,17 September 2021,"I just went to my local movie theater yesterday to see Candyman (2021). I must say, I actually enjoyed watching the film. Its focus on art and using that art to tell a story grabbed my attention. I enjoyed the main protagonist and his friends, they were very entertaining to watch. As we all saw in the trailer, the art that was used to tell a story was puppetry in which it shows darkness, a light illuminating the background to make the paper puppets glow. Now note that you should pay attention to the puppetry all the way through even the ending credits so you would understand the story more. It will really leave you with questions while some already answered for you. The scenes I will say are intense, there are plenty of kills in it.I will say at least one flaw with the movie is the story telling. I won't say that it was executed poorly. It was just confusing between how the lore was told and the Candyman you see in the movie is not the one from the very past who died, you know the original. My theory is maybe a chosen man who dies tragically by some event, their soul seeks vengeance and thus, they become the very entity that people fear. But on the subject of this here, why didn't all the other Candymen show up to kill? I am lost on that...
Also, everyone had some death wish, saying his name so many freaking times! Another scene that throws me off is why the hell was Anthony's girlfriend dreaming of her dad jumping off the building?! It made no lick of sense!Overall, I say this is an okay horror film to watch, recommended in the dark! Once you watch the film, you'll be fearing the name and mirrors. Also, it is best to watch Candyman (1992) first so you can understand this movie. Trust me, it will make a lot more sense. 1992 however is a lot better than this sequel.",Candyman

Its about Anthony ffs, it progresses superbly, I hate it when people think they can be a critic but literally miss all the points and even that its set up for a follow, the lore makes a lot of sense, like its complex and amazing how more of the lore is elaborated on, ignore the guy who said its clumsy, its a very deep horror with a complex story, JUST WATCH IT, DONT BE A CRITIC AND IF YOU LOVE HORRORS WITH A STORY YOU WILL LOVE THIS HORROR, its equally as good as the original, i love how that version is used as a backstory and part of the lore, jordan peele knows exactly what hes doing, hes no fool ;) and for the effects, they blew me away and the acting is amazing, its a rather fast paced version too and you only need to se one characters progression, he progresses into the next Candyman and thats what the story is about, so tony todd can take a rest and someone new thats young can take the reins and be the new man with the hook, ITS CLEVER WRITING.",Candyman

Honestly, there is no nuance here, or any kind of context, it is just an out-and-out attack on the police force (who are without exception all white men) and white society in general.Based in Chicago, what it doesn't mention are anything like the facts regarding the virtual civil war being fought between black gangs vying for drugs territory. And the mind boggling homicide rate that this involves. Much easier to follow the path of least resistance and blame a white conspiracy for the failings of an entire community. But still.Taking all of that into account, it is still a terrible movie. The script is risible, and the lead actors are hopelessly miscast. Now I ask myself why on earth they did not persuade the brilliant and charismatic Tony Todd to have portrayed the lead once again?Maybe he read the script and thought better of it.",Candyman

Stop the bigotry,8,29 August 2021,"First of all, as a huge fan of Candyman and Clive's short story, my suggestion is to not listen to all the bigots bringing arguments about politics and BLM to criticize this movie.Candyman has always been about oppressed, gentrified and abused minorities using the power of a legend to take revenge. The message in this movie is the same message that you find in the original one, 29 years afterwards.In a time in which sequels and reboots are made to cash in, I was surprised to see a sequel not only faithful to the original movie, but able to expand the lore of it by making it concrete and everlasting.I had very low expectations entering the cinema.And then I got surprised about the camera shots and the haunting mirror scenes, tricking your mind since the very beginning.I went out in disbelief at how beautifully crafted Nia DaCosta's work is.A masterpiece.",Candyman

402,clarkmkent,"""An Almost Complete Disappointment""",3,11 October 2021,"I have to say that while I'm not a fan of the Candyman franchise, the original had a superior story telling. In the original the focus was about the urban legend itself, while in this one...the focus is social commentary, and Candyman is more of a secondary character. The story of Candyman wasn't about white people against black people; even though it did show that in the previous stories. Candyman kills anyone who summons him, no matter what the color of their skin was. And I hated that they added that there was more than only one Candyman - if they were going to do that, they should have made it like the original Candyman (Daniel Robitaille) chose others to do his work while they were alive, and became Candyman once Daniel Robitaille was in complete possession - that would have given the final movie scene much more sense. They shouldn't have used a new Candyman (Sherman Fields) for the majority of the role, because he didn't delivery the tragic and sinister nature that Tony Todd did. Plus, why have Anthony McCoy say the iconic line, when you have the original reprising his role? And when Tony Todd was seen, it wasn't until the end, and the one line he was given...was terrible. If anything, his line should have been, ""It is time...for my masterpiece."" That line to me isn't only better, but it also leaves room for a possible sequel.It wasn't scary, it was suspenseful, the music was pretty bad, and I didn't like the font that they used for the title and credits. The acting, directing, and visual styles were superior in this movie, but that's pretty much about it. Another thing that was bad, was that there wasn't any good chemistry between Anthony and Brianna - they acted like a couple who just started dating, and not people who have known each other for years. Plus, why did they have to make it seem like all white people were treating others unfairly? While I'm sure that some places they still do that, we live in a time where people judge you on your action and attitude, not the color of your skin! There is a right way to address the issues our Country faces, but when you do it in a way where you piling all at once...people refuse to pay attention.While I can say that I'm proud of the people who did a rather descent job, it's still a bad movie. I don't want to sound harsh, but I'm completely disappointed in Jordan Peele. I find it very strange how bad a job he did with this project, because he usually blends social commentary with horror very well.",Candyman

409,natehamilton-79324,Idk it was alright ig,5,8 September 2021,"GOOD STUFF: I liked that this movie tried to be its own story, but had some great tie ins and twists that go back to the original movie. The main character's performance was the best in the movie as well, which is nice especially since everyone else was pretty bad imo. It's a visually pleasing movie too, not overtly gory and gross but a good amount of that too. Some of the story telling is pretty good too. The script is meh, good parts and stupid partsBAD STUFF: this movie is not scary but for a horror movie this seems to not be the point. I think the movie could have been more jarring at many points. I think the movie was very fixated on social issues and making sure to get that point across. Although I can't complain because that is what the writers and directors are solely focused on and are clear about that before the movie was released. Acting is pretty bad all around other than the main character and the laundry mat guy. Pretty laughable at many points in the movie. Plenty of pointless characters that are only in the movie to serve the purpose of making the girlfriend look impressive and how she is doing the main character a favor by being with him or for some group representation.Overall not much to love about this movie, but not a ton to hate either. I'm pretty indifferent to this movie and the experience of watching it with friends was pretty enjoyable.",Candyman
410,jessibriand,Im a sucker for a smart horror film.,10,6 September 2021,"When I say smart horror film I mean the characters of the film aren't idiots who run into the dark haunted basement asking if anyone is there.This delivered on that. When presented with a dilemma of the scary kind, many of the characters went ""nope"". And they lived.There were aspects that could have been improved such as adding more horror aspects but the freaky parts they did have were good. Instead of jump scares you have unnerving uncertainty. There were a few scenes where it was just talking about art or things that I found boring but that's because I don't know anything about art.I will say this. If you have Trypophobis (fear of cluster bubbles) be prepared for the end cause oooooh my god that made me want to vomit.OH and the use of paper puppets, especially the end credits, *chefs kiss* beautiful.And I clapped when Tony Todd made his appearance!",Candyman

-
Candyman (2021): You know I love everything blackity black, history, and revenge.-
Pros: The acting, the way they built the environment like it had a soul all its own, most of the effects dealing with scares, the different art pieces made and displayed, the tie in that Anthony was the BABY! And Tony Todd at the end, shook. When he called Vanessa Williams his mother I was like ""Oh they done hid the surprise well on me."" The music and cinematography was so well done, and his arm rotting was definitely one of the grossest things ever ever. Ever ever? Ever ever.-
Cons: Some of the effects like the blood in the bathroom scene with the girls, how bizarre it seemed to have these folks say the name 5 times, the way they convinced people to say it was unnatural but I noticed that in the first 2 films too, what ya gonna do? How yall see him rotting and don't get him to the hospital ASAP? The minute I saw it bandaged up from a beesting I woulda been like ""Iss time to go Tony, Uber's outside."" The end just ends and Imma need a scene where home girl Bri is siting somewhere relaxing, with an art show that shows off her late father and boyfriend's work. Sequels are never promised (~cough~ Chronicle) but I'm hoping this gets one. An extra scene would have tied it all together for me and not leaving this black girl with the cops behind her and a scary being that legit be killing everybody, mostly white folks, but black kids got it too. Them, the show, did the same thing where it left us at a moment where we are inhaling out of anticipation and left to breathe out during the credits. Unfair.-
I rate this an honest 8.5. If the ending was more well rounded it would bump up to 9.5 for sure. I really enjoyed it, I was nervous and excited to see what was coming next, and one of my neighbors had been randomly banging on the wall in the kitchen and it added to the tension in the air.)",Candyman
412,grahamcranks,Where's the horror?,1,16 September 2021,This is a missed opportunity. Artsy shots and clever angles don't hide the fact that nothing happens. Even when something is happening it's hidden from view. Waste of time.,Candyman
413,vlcupper1,Meh,3,4 September 2021,"This was just like Hereditary. It tries so hard to be scary, but collapsed under the weight of its own self importance. The score was creepy, the acting was good, the cinematography was great, but the story was so, so stupid. If the plot was about literally anything else it would have all worked. Save your money and wait for it to stream on Netflix.",Candyman

415,jeremy_steines,Why???,3,20 September 2021,"How can you make a sequel to one of the best horror films of all time and ruin it in such unbelievable fashion. I thought it was PG-13 from the way it was shot with most of the deaths happening off camera.I don't mind racial and political undertones no matter how blatant they may be. What I do mind is making a movie called Candyman about everything BUT Candyman. Zero focus on the horror elements. Nothing scary and zero suspense in this film.TNOES and Halloween remakes/reboots were far better than anything this had to offer. Not to say its not an unforgettable movie, because it will be unforgettable how terrible this film was.Honestly the 3 stars are from the Cinematography only.",Candyman
416,gemma_blatch,Ignore the Review Bombing,9,30 September 2021,"The negative reviews are brimming with white boomers foaming at the mouths, cosplaying oppression and crying out that they're the victim. Just ignore their nonsense. This film is fantastic, it tactfully deals with the white saviourism of the first film, gives Candyman a decent backstory/motive and ties it up in a neat bow. The nods to current politic issues are important and necessary.",Candyman
417,holt-rh,People are mad this is about racism...,10,19 September 2021,"... have obviously never seen the original. This movie was fantastic. The pacing and eerie atmosphere are very much in tune with the original. I love how it tied in the original. 9/10 for me, highly recommended.",Candyman
418,keravnos00,What did I miss?,5,1 September 2021,"Actual rating: 4.7The problem with this movie is...
We've SEEN the anti-racism theme, played out way better
We've SEEN name-summoning horror films with slasher ghosts
Also, I never cared for the protagonist or any other character(even if they were decently acted)
The plot was good until the last 30 minutes that just seem flat with no climaxing resolution.In the positives: Candyman offers good cinematography, decent soundtrack and some intense horror scenes with bloody violence.",Candyman
419,jordanrobinsonsmith,Boring if I'm honest.,3,23 September 2021,Honestly I found this film tough to finish. It just doesn't grip you at-all. I wouldn't bother if I was you.,Candyman
420,stugood-07006,Over-cooked and heavy-hooked aggressive homage,4,1 September 2021,"Peripherally interesting, but more ambitious than successful. This remake continually pays homage to the infinitely superior 1992 original, but in the process forgets to craft a compelling story all its own. This, whilst whacking you on the head with murky messages of contemporary issues on racism and gentrification, as if this alone makes the movie's worth. There is too little here to recommend more than a one-time watch.",Candyman
421,jordanhaney-89041,Forced ending squanders potential.,5,17 September 2021,"Being a huge fan of the original i was hugely anticipating this, especially with it being a sequel to the original and not just a remake and I left majorly disappointed. This movie had the potential to be so much more. There were some creepy moments, but they felt very far and few in between.People complain about it being woke but the original shared some white on black injustice as well and I feel like candyman would be the most fitting platform of any horror franchise to tackle the concept of social injustice, but the way they handled it here felt so cheap and forced.At the end they set up Anthony to be the next Candyman which is fine and well but they have this third party character who's name I'm unsure of go crazy out of nowhere and aide in turning Anthony into the candyman by cutting off his hand and putting a hook in it, just to make him Candyman like. Then the guy calls the cops to report Anthony just because he knows they'll shoot him and he'll be a prime canidate to be the next Candyman if he's shot by the police for no reason. So as Anthony is on the ground dying the cops shoot him instantly within a LITERAL second of finding him, on the ground, practically dead already...WHAT?! Why? It's so forced. And they do that so Anthony, now the next candyman can kill the police officers who tried to blackmail his girlfriend into saying they were justified. It's so dumb, and it feels very unnatural. There were just so many ways they could've done this concept and had it work without involving a third party that sets it all up. He could've had a gun to defend himself from the crazy guy or Candyman or whatever, or even just be standing or at least look like someone who could be commiting a crime when he got shot so it didn't seem so absurd. But no, he was on the ground, pretty much dead already.The ending was there for the sake of being there and it was so rushed and unnatural that it took away from the effectiveness of the film. Go watch the original, it's so much better.",Candyman
422,Pixtalgia,"Good Movie, Poor Story Telling",6,29 August 2021,"Being a huge fan of both Candyman and Candyman 2, I was left disappointed with what i conceived to be a half hearted approach.The film holds its original values of POC suffering throughout the years and social commentary of POC suffering in current day. Where I find the film is let down, is by both the lack of anticipation, creation and mystery behind the kill-scenes as well as having the main values of the movie being lost and leaving moments that could have built the story more left as a throw away scene in the movie.On the positive side, the movie was filmed beautifully and the acting was great. Great film to watch, not much watchability.",Candyman
423,matt-27634,"Less social commentary, more horror please",5,17 September 2021,"I actually didn't realize this was a sequel, I thought it was a remake/reboot before watching it. Good thing I vaguely remember the originals.I remember watching Candyman as a kid and still to this day will not say the name in front of a mirror!This film is pretty slow paced (almost boring at times) and there's a LOT of dialogue.I've heard lots of comparisons to the 2019 film 'Velvet Buzzsaw' and I can't help but agree.The kills that were shown onscreen were good, but most weren't shown which was disappointing. I was expecting more horror and less social commentary and political themes.",Candyman
424,brena-46994,Good movie for what it's worth,7,30 August 2021,It's quite sad that this got so many low votes because people were in their feelings.

But the movie couldn't be more disappointing. The story didn't make any sense, there were so so many plotholes and the characters were straight up unbearable. I really really wanted to like this film, but it proved throughout that it just isn't thought through. I was visually very impressed tho, but that really does not make up for a bad story.I think, the amazing trailer made the experience of watching the movie worse. My very high expectations were crushed.",Candyman
430,luanadpsss,Not bad at all,7,20 September 2021,"The Candyman in this movie is an embodiment the rage and pain carried by all that died of racial violence in Cabrini-Green.

A lot of questions not answered and some predictable moments .

It was definitely one of the best movies of the year horror or non horror with a time of 1hr 30 mins it packs alot in and that made me a happy customer of the Candy man's candy store.bit not perfect.,Candyman

But it was just messy. The good parts were really good, the parts about Candyman was something with weight. But the rest of the movie was just as some others say, messy. The politics around it just drowned the movie. I don't watch horror movies, or any movies, to get politics involved, I don't wanna sit there and be annoyed with this stuff I'm watching. It takes my mind off the movie completley.Ending was great, Candyman was great. The other 85% was just annoying. Don't involve politic views in your movies, please stop.",Candyman

They have flung Tony Todd's young CGI'd face on an actor for literally the last 7 seconds of the film and tried to pass it off as Candyman, have to say that 7 seconds was far more entertaining than the 89 minutes 53secs that came before it. Please do not go into this film thinking you are going to see candyman of old because you are not!! They have lost that gothic feel the original carried throughout the whole movie, the build up to Candyman coming back or making his first appearance after 30 years was way off I didn't feel the fear or anticipation I did all them years ago what we have here is a director trying to be clever and putting there own spin on it and has failed miserably, just give the fans the legend that strikes fear into them every time they look in a mirror I'm 34 and still to this day I have never said his name 5 times in a mirror yet. This movie in whole is not Candyman I'm not sure what it is except awful and lackluster unfortunately Candyman is not back if you are a fan of the original I would say stay away it's painful. I don't know how it's sitting on a 6.5.",Candyman

440,victoriahall-203-457138,"Liked the body horror aspect, but this just wasn't scary enough",6,13 October 2021,"This film had really great sound design, you'll need to remind yourself to stop trying to swat bees away from your head. The use of paper puppets is cute, but reminded me of the end credits for Lemony Snickett-a little juvenile. If you like body horror, you'll enjoy the homages to The Fly, including an awesome shot where the lead character slides off his rotten finger nail a la Jeff Gldblum. The make up and effects, especially the honeycomb skin, were pretty cool.However, the rest of the film was a little disappointing. The script and themes were too on the nose and lacked the artistic subtlety, which may make you cringe at times. The ""new"" candyman wasn't scary at all. In fact, I didn't find a single scene frightening unfortunately. I didn't care about any of the characters and there was some really bad acting (the white couple chit chatting in the gallery before they get slashed was particularly awful)..Tony Todd's momentary appearance at the end looked like a deep fake because of all the digital de-aging and it just seemed like a consolation prize for fans of the original film.Probably would have been a better film if Clive Barker, the original writer of the story, had been involved.",Candyman
441,greig13,Sublime beauty,9,24 October 2021,This film is so much better than reviews here would suggest.

It hits on ALL notes.,Candyman
442,rbrewer43,Candyman yhe Tulpa,7,5 September 2021,I prefer the original movie only slightly! This film expands on the Candyman mythos in a way every other sequel failed. It's an exciting exploration of the power of myth and the idea that we create our own monsters!,Candyman

447,amiemccreery,Say my name....,2,29 August 2021,"I was desperate to love this film after waiting an extra 2 years for it to be released.Unfortunately I just couldn't. There is zero character development and even less gore... all the gruesome stuff is always out of shot and you never really see anything.The premise was just played with far too much and I feel that everything that made the Candyman films so special just wasn't included in this filmI missed the eerie music score desperately from the first film and really anticipated they would find a way to incorporate it during the film.The characters are not likeable so you really don't care when anything happens. Not even the lead Anthony.The cgi with the bees drove me absolutely insane and at times I was just tempted to walk out the cinema. You see Tony Todd for around five seconds through the whole film and I felt like his role as the candyman is what makes the films so special. Again, this was not the case with this reboot. If you adore the original as much as I do then please don't expect too much from this.The only part of the film I really enjoyed was when there was a brief discussion about Helen Lyle, and when you briefly get to see Anthony's mum, played by Vanessa Williams.I really wish this film was as amazing as I was expecting it to be but I was sorely disappointed.",Candyman
448,zombipantz,Candymen..apparently,1,16 September 2021,"This wa more of a message than a movie and it was poorly explained, the fact that they said in interviews that they wanted to ""take back the narrative"" should have been enough. There was nothing to take back, this was a work of fiction and blatantly disregarded the original work and turned it into a mess. The ending with Tony Todd being revealed at the end was cool and all. However, it made zero sense and apparently every tragic person that died in history that was african american got to be a ""candyman"". Convaluted story and the director and jordan peele had zero passion in this film. This was not a candyman movie at all, it was just a sad attempt at trying to use a multi million dollar film as a campaign for the obvious.",Candyman
449,evanthorne,"A Half mesmerizing, half infuriating experience.",5,11 September 2021,"To start, this movie is visually incredible! All of the imagery involving mirrors gives the Candyman a true, but perfectly limited presence, making slight glimpses of him quite horrific at points! The biggest problem for myself is the script feels very heavy handed with its message, juggling inconsistent logic with awkwardly presented dialogue and characters that don't really stand out that much. I would recommend checking out purely for the visual side since it does have a lot to offer there, but maybe just stick to a one time watch.",Candyman

The premis that candyman is not just one man but a collective thought and can be any black man that has been wrongly punished for crimes he didn't commit speaks very loudly not only through history but in our current times creating a very real horror.The film build suspense throughout its entire run with a compelling lead making you not only empathetic towards him but also to candyman himself.Overall I think its a brilliant step in the right direction , surpassing the original in a alot ways from visuals to story and I look forward to a sequel that builds upon the next candy man.",Candyman

The racial undertones in this movie is nauseating and I guess now Candyman is the ""Dark Avenger"" for racial injustice. This movie had so much potential ,unfortunately, after being bogged down with a shallow storyline, a disappointing ending and the constant ""police brutality/racism"" narrative I couldn't wait for this movie to be over!",Candyman
459,empoweringmanagement,"Beautiful film, not really a traditional horror movie",8,31 August 2021,"Well, you can tell that a movie has racial themes, because it attracts the loony ""1 star brigade"" who pan the movie because they don't like to be challenged intellectually. This is a beautifully made film, but it was a mistake to bill this as a horror movie, because simple people expect jump scares and gore. The horror in this movie is the continued oppression of poor and black people in America. It is shot very artistically, and the use of shadow puppet animation in parts is very effective. Please don't go in expecting to be ""scared"" like it's the original. There are plenty of traditionally scary movies out there. Enjoy this one for the cinematography and the message.",Candyman
460,grosselli,Somewhat disappointing (SPOILERS INCLUDED),4,27 August 2021,"There was a certain finesse, yet undeniable horror that Tony Todd brought to the character of Candyman. That was not captured in this movie, at all. When I was younger and the original released, I was incredibly scared of Candyman. He's a phenomenal actor who brought the character to the list or horror icons.There were certain aspects to the movie that I liked about the movie. The telling of a story, and the obsessions that follows. Taking over your life so that it pours into everything you do and are. The story of the CandyMEN throughout history which isn't a terrible idea to add to the story, but the focus on Daniel Robitaille being the original would suggest a tremendous reveal of Tony Todd as Candyman at some point being Candyman, and not just in the last 4 seconds of the movie.I was truly anticipating his on screen return and was completely let down by it.I didn't think the movie was completely terrible, and some of the death scenes were good, but I feel they took a decent idea and couldn't properly execute it for the screen. A good attempt, but not the movie I was expecting. It's hard to pass the torch to a new Candyman when Tony Todd is the one passing it. We saw it happen with Freddy, Pinhead, etc. Tony Todd IS Candyman, and anyone who steps into those shoes has a lot to live up to, and I think that's basically impossible.",Candyman

Helen's voice features in this film retelling the myth and Anne-Marie, the mother of the baby Helen saved (and the owner of the decapitated rottweiler), has a cameo. It all comes back to Daniel Robitaille in the end, to the original.I think this is a mistake, though.From the trailer I thought maybe Sherman (the new guy with a hook for a hand that gives sweets to kids and gets brutalised by the police) was a new modern re-telling of Candyman to replace the old one and that the main character in this film would hear that story, become obsessed as Helen did before him, and lose his mind/become Candyman himself (because Anthony, the main character, is living in the gentrified Cabrini Green, almost exactly the same way Helen was living in a middle class apartment building that was originally meant to be the site of Cabrini Green - there's a lot of parallels). That's the film I thought I'd see. A whole new Candyman that was just a lovely nod to the original.When I heard Tony Todd would feature in it I didn't think he'd ""be"" Candyman, I thought it'd just be a cool cameo! Like some wise old dude in Cabrini Green who warns Anthony and we'd all go ""aaahh!! Did you see? That was him that was!"" Like how Stephen King appears in some of his own films. This film felt like it would be an ode to Tony/to the original, but not a direct part of it.It could have been a lot more relevant to the BLM movement with Sherman's story of police brutality, and still could have maintained the horror and tradition of the original without having to resurrect the original. I thought it couldn't fail. I was very excited to see that film. I've been waiting two years for it!The film I got was confusing.From a horror fan perspective... The murder scenes are truly awful in a B movie sense. Not scary in the least (not even jump scary), bloody but not in any innovative ways, and the dialogue between the first two victims...my god did they deserve death! I think the writing is deliberately terrible here...? But it doesn't, importantly, succeed in being comical, either. It's just plain terrible. I think the murders are also deliberately brushed aside and made insignificant (to refer to Sherman's brutal end seeming insignificant to the public) but in what was originally a slasher horror part of the requisite is some good slashing!Anthony's skin becoming (what I read from a critic) rotten honeycomb after being stung by a bee was kind of cool but minimised rather by the fact no one ever mentioned it! That was just bizarre to me. His girlfriend, Brianna, must have been repulsed surely but never mentions it, as if it isn't happening. This might have been the case, it might have been in his head, except other people can see it from what I gather (""do I look okay, mum?"" - paraphrased)The best horror scene is when the film truly becomes confusing unfortunately and Burke saws off Anthony's hand to make him the next Candyman, but as I say this just makes the entire film confusing so it's hard to enjoy the horror.Why would Burke be motivated into creating a new Candyman when the Candyman he knew killed his sister? If it is to get revenge for Sherman and to kill the police that he's called to the scene then this misses the point of Candyman somewhat. Candyman doesn't have a revenge motive, or a motive at all really, and is summoned and kills indiscriminately. Is it suggesting any Black person who is arrested can say his name in the wing mirror and have the cops slaughtered in order to escape? But Candyman would also kill those who summoned him, too... I just don't see how he can become the antihero and symbol of social justice the film wants him to be at the end.I don't know anyone well enough in this film to know what's going on, anyway. We only get a glimpse into Brianna's past, her dad jumped to his death in front of her, and yet she finds dead people at work and seems to cope well. Maybe they chose not to give the characters a past in a bid to avoid them being trauma survivors and to avoid a more classic telling of Black history. But in so doing I just felt like they were all complete strangers acting strangely for no apparent reason.Anthony is an unlikeable main character. He doesn't seem to care about anyone but himself and we don't find out why he doesn't want to talk to his mum, ever (does he sense she's lied to him his whole life because he certainly doesn't know that yet?). His ambition to succeed as an artist is ruthless. It's kind of funny he must stop from smiling when someone is killed in front of his artwork, meaning his art gets a mention on the news, but it's not a normal response really! He might qualify as a narcissist or a psychopath.BUT the idea of ambition being your downfall is another parallel with Helen. She's so determined to blow Purcell's paper on Candyman out of the water with her own that she goes and gets herself killed by the myth she's writing on. There's nothing wrong with this being the key to it all as Candyman has always been a story about poor housing and gentrification - why shouldn't the stories of the main characters be about blind ambition (with a fair amount of ignorance about what goes on on their own doorstep leading only to a drive to make a living off it) with a grave cost? There's no need to overreach and overcomplicate that.I have no idea why Anthony becomes rotten honeycomb body man, I don't know what Candyman's purpose is for him if he has one (is the bee sting a Candyman calling card or just a bee sting?), I dunno what Burke's deal is or how he managed to lure Anthony into a laundromat to achieve his lifetime goal of resurrecting Candyman. Anthony seemed to go to the laundromat of his own accord so that was a bit of bad luck, I guess!Anthony being potentially possessed by Candyman (becoming honeycomb man) only makes sense if he's possessed by Daniel, the original Candyman, because his art improves significantly after the bee sting (Daniel was a portrait artist of some standing) and why would Sherman bring bees with him when he didn't suffer the same bee related fate as Daniel..?Candyman is an amalgamation of myths (bloody Mary, the guy with a hook for a hand in campfire tales, razor blades in sweets), but he very well could have existed as his origin story is plausible. That makes for a great myth and one that Helen buys into at the cost of her life. The new Candyman commits the sin of making Candyman too real and taking away the horror of what might be lurking in the shadows. The cinematography is great in parts. It's a visual treat. But where's the great story to tell your friends about at school? I can't imagine a new generation of kids daring each other to say his name after this with any genuine trepidation, but as a 90s child I certainly did...",Candyman

463,groovy_mann,Not bad but could've been better...,5,3 October 2021,"Candyman is not a bad movie per se, but I feel like it deviated from the original movies. I'm all for addressing current issues, discussing them and eventually solving them, it just feels like they hijacked a popular movie franchise - one of the best IMHO - to do that.There is a time and place for everything; more importantly, c'mon now, where is Tony Todd?? A brief cameo at the end isn't cutting it.I would've liked to see more people fall victim to his hook hand, more suspense, more details about the Candyman lore.Fans of Clive Barkers' works no doubt noticed the missing detail in almost all of his films/books - towards the end, the protagonist always morphs into the antagonist.

Certainly slower paced but not at the expense of the story or film whatsoever, which came in at a very respectable length of way under 2 hours. Maybe a younger generation wants more screams and destruction, and ridiculous exposition, but I for one got exactly the film I wanted, aimed as it is at an intelligent audience, leaving me the right amount of freaked for the dark drive home!",Candyman

Magical movie.",Candyman
468,amazonarnica,What happened to the concept of entertainment in filmmaking?,1,24 September 2021,The entertainment concept is forgotten and clearly non-existent in this one.

I didn't watch the original movie but after this i don't want to, although i believe that it's better then this since it couldn't possibly be worse.

He appears for only a few seconds in the final scene of the movie... He is never even seen killing or really being the Candyman. It almost just feels like he was shoved in there for the last few seconds so more people have an actual reason to go see this movie.Other than those two points, this movie wasn't bad. As a film, it was pretty good actually. It was overall kind of terrifying, and the storyline was actually pretty well constructed. 7/10.",Candyman
471,functioningfine,Pretty disappointing,4,1 September 2021,"SPOILERS!!!What a let down after such a long wait. The new Candyman dude looked like he was mentally challenged hiding in walls, offering people candy. The bee sting part is just too dumb. Dudes skin is rotting and he takes forever to go to a hospital. His own mom doesn't notice his whole side of his face is rotting off until several minutes into a conversation. Not in the least bit scary. If you're going to add to a horror franchise, can you at least make it a horror movie. Minimal gore. Most murders are just bodies flopping with blood. Didn't get the girls bathroom scene at all. Seems misplaced or could have been cut altogether. The CGI bees were terrible. I understand making a movie today to add in what's going on with the world at this moment with police brutality, the mistreatment of blacks, how ghettos are formed, but you can make that point and still make a horror movie, much like the original. This was far from horror. It was very boring. 7 people total in the theater. Also it broke news that it was the number one movie for a black female director. Well the original was good, and the setbacks built up anticipation, so it had that going for it, plus, did it even have any competition as far as a new movie opening this past weekend? I actually enjoyed Get Out, and I'm actually a big fan of US, Peele has writing credits on this. This was trash. This just passed Black Widow as the worst movie I've seen this year.",Candyman
472,ainser99,"Loved the original, but this one was dull as dishwater.",1,7 September 2021,It would seem they wanted to make a political point ahead of making a enjoyable movie. I'd be OK with a political message if the film wasn't so boring.,Candyman

476,deathsembrace,It's funny how when there's a movie about injustice in the black community it gets such low scores,10,25 September 2021,"I suppose the question what is black horror and just exactly who is it for bares answering. Black horror is a discussion really about what scares us as the black community. Unfortunately that answer in our fair country is mostly the rotten fruits of racism. What starts out as what most people think is such a small trifle of a matter quickly and i mean hurriedly spirals out of control into an abscess of a problem that ends up killing innocent people in terrible ways, so horrible it becomes legend. So much so that some people might not even believe you generations down the line. That was difficult to watch and i guess it should be. I was a huge fan of the first candyman, in fact it remains one of the only movies that has ever scared me. This one ties all of them up neatly, doesn't leave much to the imagination except for what happened before the credits rolled.SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINTThe mythos of the story makes Candyman himself more of an antihero. It works nicely for bees and what they do for their hives. From the workers to a functioning queen. Consider the current incarnation of the CM the queen and the others the worker bees. Its not too loose of an analogy. I think if you really 'get' the things I've mentioned, you'll really like this. Give it a chance, don't pay too much attention to the lower scores.",Candyman

The makeup/sfx are beautifully gruesome.The social commentary is well done and runs much, much deeper than the ""white people bad"" thing that the nay-sayers are whining about.It gives love to the lovers of the original, yet feels like fresh material.

482,witherspoonmontez,Interesting Storyline,7,11 September 2021,I came into thinking that this movie was going to be a cheap knockoff to the original Candyman movie.

484,surrealsanguine,Layers of conplexity,10,19 September 2021,I really enjoyed this film. It has a lot of little nods to the 1992 film and works well as a sequel. I appreciate that they brought back many of the original cast to reprise their roles and took an interesting direction with social messaging on systemic violence and how it's perpetuated over time. The movie used a lot of careful consideration on presentation. They demonstrated violence without uses it for shock appeal. I also really love all the symbolism and use of the mirrors throughout the film. It felt like every detail was carefully thought out and purposeful. This film easily makes it on to my favorites list.,Candyman
485,sway1998,Long overdue Mediocre Sequel,5,17 September 2021,Certainly didn't live up to the original movie(1992).

Simply no jumps, no twists, no gore and a very disappointing film which lets down its potential. Great acting from all but excited by bad directions and a studio not willing to again bring back the gore and fear you would get in a 80s movie. Going for a lower certificate to gain more audience is a horrible choice. I could have done a lot better with the same script and aimed it at adults not teens. Studios need take a risk and return to creating the gore and horror not a CGI quick money grabber. I wish I could be giving the chance to create a real film for the audience snd not subject them to this type of disappointment. But till my proposal snd training are given a green light I'm stuck with others watching this sad loss of great potential.

There was some interesting ideas and great cinematography, but the themes it presented & social commentary were handled with the subtely of a sledgehammer to the face. Way too unbalanced. All black people are innocent victims, all the white people were bullies & then slaughtered by ""Candyman"" (NOT Tony Todd, some creeper named Sherman) & all the cops instantly killed the black folks, even as they lay on the ground, unarmed & dying.

492,djhighyellow-81558,I really wanted to like it more,6,16 September 2021,"I had been looking forward to the reboot/continuation of the Candyman series since I heard it announced a few years ago. The cast was pretty good, they all turned in solid performances with the material they were given but the movie had several flaws.First off, as it has been pointed out, there wasn't enough horror. I went with a friend who claimed to be a scardey cat and not once did she jump into my arms. Seriously though, the body count was high enough but there wasn't enough suspense around the killings and a few scenes could have been more graphic.As far as the acting, it was fine but there was no character development at all so it was hard to connect to any of the characters or care what happened to them. More backstory with the protagonist's mom would have been good (also the actress is beautiful). The backstory seemed rushed throughout the film. They definitely could have developed the Candyman legend a bit more.The political undertones were fine, in fact I would expect no less from a movie dealing with racial issues that was made in the last few years. I didn't think they beat the audience over the head with politics, the conversations were woven into the dialogue. People really do talk that way about gentrification, urbanization, policing, etc.Overall it was above average for the acting, cinematography, and pacing in a horror film. There were just too many holes in the plot, and it lacked a good hook (no pun intended) to draw the audience in.If I was giving it a letter grade it'd be a ""C"".",Candyman

They did need more on Helen Lyle, bring back Virginia Madsen & Tony Todd like Bride of chucky style. Fans will want more gore, more blood, more fear. Tony Todd's voice in the carpark scene in the original is haunting and chilling. Vanessa Williams needs more screen time. Get her to bring Helen back. It's not as political as it is being made out to be. Would I watch it again? Yes. Does it deserve a sequel? Yes.

Its trying to be a ""smarter"" slasher movie and they create a pretty good mythology around Candyman and the history of racism. But rather than explore that, the final act seems rushed. I was confused by the motivations.The plot of Anthony being ""chosen"" by Candyman seems far fetched. His return to Cabrina was.driven by Brianna. And if his mom was so convinced that he had been marked in some way, why not say something when he first moved back there?What was the deal with Brianna and her father's suicide? That seemed like sub-plot that went no where.And then there's Will. I liked the twist that he was really trying to bring Candyman back, but.... he sort of already was. He had killed like 7 people without sacrificing Anthony so what was the point of all that.This felt like ""Us"" all over again.

I came to see a show a classic. The acting was decent it was the STORYLINE. The storyline was whack as ""working 9-5 on a Sunday"".

The fact they had a few deaths and they damn near connected (i.e. The high school girls) never reported on them. How the hell they end up at a church at the end why didn't ol girl run away but back into the abandoned building to save her dude that looked like a person with a skin disease and his hand cut off sorry dude you would have been left to your own device. It was just too much stuff to check the boxes ... gay couple, say her name (girl name Bryanna), gentrification, police brutality, black woman saving her man, black girl in bathroom doesn't get killed actually no minorities got killed only Shay whitie... how did Candyman end up from New Orleans, I was confused AF because I never remembered Sherman from day one.

However if they just focused on that I would've liked it more. The constant beating you over the head with the woke political messages about race and such just drowned this film for me. I'm all for a good message. And that's not to say you can't do it. Jordan Peele did it fantastically with Get Out and Us. But I'm trying to see a good horror film and it was in points.

The cinematography was gorgeous, the acting was phenomenal, the music and lighting was inspired and the violence was the good kind of gross!!!There was a lot of social commentary with this film, gentrification, police brutality, class struggle, and if that bothers you please think about why that is.

511,terryp-94962,"I was looking forward to this, but...",6,6 September 2021,"First off, I'm a huge fan of the original 1992 Candyman with Tony Todd. (Only the first one, not so much the sequels) I was excited about the remake, due to the fact that the producer had recently made Get Out and Us, which are two other exceptional modern thrillers that I really enjoyed. I figured Candyman 2021 was a sure thing. Well, not so much.Spoilers!!!!!The main problem was the choppy plot and unclear rules and reasons for certain events. For example, Candyman can be summoned through windows now. I thought it had to be a mirror. So that means any reflective surface can summon Candyman now? How about a device with a screen that's turned off? Laptop, tablet, phone screen, etc.? How about saying Candyman 5x while looking into the surface of a freshly waxed black car? What are the rules? And exactly who has to say his name 5 times? There's once scene where someone says his name 4 times, then another person says it the 5th time. Candyman is unleashed. Don't get me started on the reasons why that doesn't make sense.The next major problem is how and why there are multiple Candymen, and what's the criteria for one to become a Candyman? Doe's it just have to be a Black man who gets murdered by a White person? As ridiculous as it sounds, that's exactly what the puppet show at the end depicts. The main protagonist gets stung by a bee, which gets horribly infected and he never gets metical attention, even as his entire right side seems to rot. Makes zero sense. He should have been in the E. R. What kind of bee was that? A Candyman bee. What if it had stung a female? Candylady now? Makes no sense. There's more, but I'll leave the criticism at that.Despite the shortcomings, there were things about the movie that I really enjoyed. First off, the main characters make a very appealing couple. Two good-looking and well styled people. Their acting and chemistry come across well. The scenes are very nicely shot. The creepy music and shots of Chicago are good. The first kill is very good, and the old-school Candyman in the movie (not Tony Todd) is really creepy.Overall, the movie doesn't quite live up to it's own hype, and it's nowhere near as good as the original. Candyman 2021 is shallow, way too political, and has confusing rules on who, what, why, and how regarding Candyman's existence and abilities. Tony Todd's Candyman portrayal was, and still is leaps and bounds ahead of this one, and Mr. Todd only gets a 5 second cameo in CGI form in Candyman 2021.Check it out for yourself. You'll see what I'm talking about.",Candyman
512,janoblong,A worthy expansion on a chilling lore,7,5 September 2021,"After seeing this film, as well the original but no other installment in the franchise, its
clear the film stands strongly with its '92 original brother. This film's main character is played masterfully, truly embodying an artist that has been consumed by the dark legend of Candyman to the point he becomes perpetually tortured. With regards to scares, there are certainly chilling visuals which were uncomfortable; which weren't the bloody scenes, which is the epitome of horror done well. The culmination with the meaning it gives to the main character and the legend as a whole are pretty smart and make the film a satisfying watch. There is a certain action the ghost makes continuously in the film, which was something that really unsettled me, given the way it was filmed. A hint: why walk, when you could.. ugh..",Candyman

I saw the trailer and thought the police brutality angle would definitely work for this movie. But man it was just overkill.

518,darkshadows-99160,Meh,3,16 October 2021,This sequel was just ok for me personally. It was well acted however if was to slow me. The best scene was the girls in the restroom . This was in the trailer. Also I don't mind social issues in the films I watch I just don't like it when it is forced down your throat. The original and its dealing with social issues was a perfect blend with the horror story being told. Now would I watch this again well maybe if there was nothing better to watch.,Candyman
519,FrancoisTwisp,So let down.,5,27 August 2021,"Granted, I had such I hopes and expectations for this film. I'll start with the good. The cinematography was spectacular. Such a beautifully shot film that showed the antagonist in just the right ways. It honestly might be the best part of the film. The performance were fantastic. Abdul-Mateen and Teyonah Parris along with other supporting cast were so good in their roles. Now for the bad. I absolutely despise the idea that the legend of Candyman encapsulates multiple back stories from multiple victims. That's right, Daniel Robitaille isn't the main antagonist and actually has very little to do with the story. Instead, the legend of Candyman is used as a catalyst for multiple victims of racial injustice. We are all here for Tony Todd's performance and Robitaille legend. My second biggest complaint is that the screenwriters took the subtle nuances and hidden meaning of the original film and decided to beat you over the head with social commentary on police brutality and evil white folks. I love social commentary in film, Get out, US and The People Under The Stairs all have similar messages. The ""social commentary"" in Candyman(2021) is the main character and just distasteful. It is constantly mentioned with no subtlety or creativity. There are scenes involving police that just make you roll your eyes with how terribly all cops are portrayed. The final act is just poorly written. It comes out of nowhere and doesn't match the tone of the fist 3/4 of the movie. The final 10 minutes makes you think you were watching one of the trashy slasher Candyman sequels. With al that said, even if you removed to social commentary aspect of the film, it is just not a good movie. The creators care more about drilling a message into your head than delivery a good film. Very surprised that having the great Jordan Peele attached didn't result in something better.",Candyman

This is evident by the opening credits which instead of looking down on Chicago we're looking up. Such a great touch. Like Helen in the original, our protagonist Anthony becomes obsessed with uncovering the legend of Candyman. If you know the original well you'll know who Anthony is as soon as you hear his full name. I really like his connection to the original.There are several excellent set pieces including some mean girls cluelessly summoning Candyman in the school bathroom. What Nia DaCosta does with s compact mirror had me grinning ear to ear. If there's one flaw I wish maybe we had a little bit more at the end with Brianna (Anthony's girlfriend.There was an opportunity to further mirror the original regarding her character and Helen but I don't want to spoil anything. Like the best horror this reflects the times we live in. Police brutality cannot be ignored. Some have complained that it's too on the nose. Others have said it doesn't go far enough.

Now, that's all I liked.The writing did not work. There's so much social commentary that's its beaten into the viewers face. The writer spells out racism like we're new to planet earth. The film is a slow burn the builds the last five minutes. The last 5 were what I wanted a hour of the movie to be. I think the ending was rushed and the opportunity to see Tony Todd was wasted. I wanted to hear his voice and see his face but the writers did the opposite. The story had too many plot holes and it wasted a chance to breath life in this story.I enjoyed Get Out but I hate.d Us.

Although it is a decent sequel, it's not a good reboot and tries to change the original story way too much by adding unnecessary things and making it way more complicated than it needs to be. It's too bad because it does have great atmosphere, direction, the murder scenes are done really well, and the acting is top-notch but, it's definitely lacking otherwise.

HOWEVER, the acting, cinematography, and first hour and a bit are excellent. I was thoroughly engrossed.

The climax of the movie has a cop show up at crime scene and instantly kill a near-death man who is lying on the ground unarmed, simply because he is black.His girlfriend (who was cradling his body before he was shot twice) is then arrested, and while she is in the back of the police cruiser the officer in there with her tells her that if she doesn't agree to 'tell the story the way he wants her to tell it' that he'll send her to prison as an accomplice to the Candyman murders.",Candyman

543,alamriaban,idk man,5,9 September 2021,"I'll start by saying the movie is alright,
not that good but not that bad.Let's start with the acting:
it's average with every actor except with Teyonah Parris that palys Brianna Cartwright, she's great.Directing:
it's very very basic, but not horrible, there are few cool shots here and there but it's not enough to impress.The plot:
it's not interesting enough, at least for me.Easy to predict what's gonna happen.I might be dumb but there are plot holes everywhere.And useless scenes they didn't come back to, to make sense of them.The ending is so not it.The message behind the movie:i liked the political message behind it and how it portrays what African Americans go through and in this movie they focused on police brutality and police corruption and gentrification and how the white Supremacists locked African Americans away in ghettos to die.The score:
not too impressed.Finale thoughts:
i'm really happy for the director being the first black woman to get the number 1 movie in north america, shout out to her.I'm not sure if it's consider it a horror movie, not scary at all.And what rubs the salt on the wound even more is the kills are off camera and the bodies most the time are not even shown.And What perfectly summed up this movie to me is:
mediocre at best but still very much disappointing.",Candyman
544,lillifrazier,This was definitely not up to par with Jordan Peeles other work.,4,1 September 2021,"I had two expectations for this film. One, as a horror/thriller film, I always expect to feel anxiety and tension rise in myself as I watch. This did not deliver that at all in any way shape or form. There are sfx effects that are grotesque and may make you cringe (especially if you have trypophobia), but otherwise this (as a horror film) felt highly cheesy. Secondly, Jordan Peele has always found a way to incorporate meaning to his film that was thoughtful and meticulous. This was much more in your face and felt like a performative ""woke."" Thus making the film feel even cheesier- this would've passed better as a satire if I didn't have the understanding the film took itself seriously. Is there a meaningful message from the original candyman that carries to this film? Yes. However, highly disappointed in the way such a meaningful topic was handled. And before anyone reprimands me at not being impressed and assumes I'm white- I'm black. But on a final note, if you want to watch a horror film, definitely skip this. If you want to watch a Jordan Peele film, maybe watch this if you feel you need to, but I'd just turn around and rewatch Get Out or Us.",Candyman

547,karudderham,Was it really a sequel?,2,30 September 2021,"So I'll start with the positives... the actors were better than a lot of horror actors that have debuted this year, the movie looked clean and crisp but that about sums it up. Unfortunately this version is meant to be a direct sequel to the 1992 film but somehow manages to completely retcon the origin story of the character which throws a wrench into the story. Candy man was not a strange/manic amputee that handed out candy to the kids of the projects. This was the first of many head scratching moments. As a reboot this film might have worked but a direct sequel? I'm afraid not.Take it for what it is and forget just about everything you know from the original.",Candyman

The story an and action wasn't even worth the paper it was written on.Way to much Cops are horrible people, and hunt black people down and kill them. Dont know what its like to live in Chicago but i doubt a cop walks in and just starts shooting. Acting like this is the wild west wanted dead or alive mentality.Most of the Killing happens of screen so you dont really get to see anything. Most of the time i just figured they were slitting their own wrist or something. Felt like the move should have been pg-13 if anything.All i can stay is you cant beat the original. This movie really dosent do it justice, and theirs really no reason to make another.",Candyman
549,hoshind,Disappointed.,4,7 September 2021,"So, I was waiting for this movie for a while. There was a brief period I forgot about it following the original delay, but when interest started to spark back up, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited. Candyman is one of my favorite horror films from the 90s, and a modern reimagining sounded great. Especially during the current political climate, in which the racial themes of the original seem more important than ever.But after watching, I can't say I particularly enjoyed the newest Candyman film.Personally, I think Candyman would have worked a lot better as a standalone film. But, as usual, two sequels spawned from the original, followed by this 'direct sequel'. The only reason I'm hesitant on calling it a direct sequel is because the marketing on this movie was terribly confusing. One day it was a spiritual sequel, the next a remake, then a direct sequel. We ended up having another direct sequel film, which I don't really have a problem with, even if it's becoming a bit tired with movies like Halloween (2018) and the upcoming Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Either way, I didn't really have an issue with that. The two original sequels weren't the best, although I feel like the second movie gets more hate than it deserves.Day of the Dead deserves the hate, though.Anyway, after watching this movie, I actually found it being a direct sequel to be one of its biggest faults. The new Candyman tries to do some different things with the lore, which can be interesting, but ultimately ended up as being contradictory to the events of the previous film. I'm fine with adding new lore, and honestly I feel like parts of it were done well in this film, such as expanding the idea of Candyman to more of an 'idea' rather than just a single person, but overall it's both self contradictory and never mentioned in the original film. It creates a lot more question than answers, and ultimately falters to deliver any meaningful messages.Speaking of messages, this movie is chock full of them. And before I mention this, I'd just like to be honest and say that I do agree with a lot that this movie was trying to say. I think they had good ideas, and had good messages that they were trying to convey, but it all just came about far too ham-fisted to be taken seriously. And it's a shame, because Candyman wants to address serious issues, but ends up making them far too apparent and hardly nuanced, without providing any insightful observations to help convince audience members of its message. At a point it becomes comical, which is particularly prevalent in a scene where a white officer gives a (very confusing) ultimatum to a black woman that at first glance appears to be the victim of a crime.And while these attempted messages take up a large part of the film, their poor deliveries isn't the biggest issue. That would be the plot. And by God, was it awful. Poor attempts at body horror, uninteresting characters, talking talking talking...the whole thing just comes off as extremely boring and illogical. Why would the main character not go to the hospital to get an infection checked out immediately after his skin starts rotting? I don't know. Why did the girl summoning Candyman not get killed by him at the end of the movie? I don't know the answer to that either. The entire story feels too slow, and too illogical to enjoy aside from starting the occasional fit of giggles in the theater.As for the acting, it's fine. The main cast isn't really given much good material to work with, leaving a lot to be desired for their characters. Characters that are extremely underdeveloped, might I add. I will say though, Vanessa Williams who reprises her role from the first film is a very welcome addition, and she definitely brings some soul to the film, even if she barely gets any screen time.The cinematography is good, and many of the films visuals are actually really good, and I have to give props for that, even if they do become a bit stale at a point.But my biggest complaint is the lack of gore. The crew was constantly going on to talk about how gory the film was, and how it would please fans of gore on film. Unfortunately, Candyman doesn't deliver. There is a good kill early in the movie, but after that...nothing. Offscreen deaths, blood splatters that obscure the gory goods, everything seems toned down. It's a shame, but I guess this type of restraint can be seen in a lot of post 2010 slashers.Overall, Candyman isn't horrible. It isn't as bad as Candyman 3, and the director is certainly competent. But a boring script and an uninteresting series of deaths makes this movie very underwhelming after a long wait.",Candyman

Or is he a cold blooded murderer? Is he both? Did he change over time? To many questions, not enough answers.It feels like only 40% of the movie was actually horror, and the rest was money-grabbing by using BLM and activism as a way to grab attention.I'm not against BLM and I support it, but I'm also not for using BLM in an attempt to make your movie more ""woke"" and ""eye-opening"", because in my opinion this is just using the entire movement to make money.Now onto the LGBTQ+ community and Candyman.

And why are there only gay men, no other member of the LGBTQ+ community?I know more about this subject because I am LGBTQ+ and do NOT like it when movies/shows use the community as a way of making money.It's so obvious in Candyman that they know very little about LGBTQ+; they only use gay people and make them stereotypical as all get out. They didn't have to do that to show that the characters are gay.They literally could've just had them be gay and not say ""Mm-mm-mmm"" when drinking wine or had them have the stereotypical gay accent. They do realise not all gay men talk like that, right? The majority actually don't talk like that.There's nothing wrong with talking that way or saying those things, but the fact that they use these stereotypes so often it just gets annoying and shows the amount of surface-level research they've done into the LGBTQ+ community.One way to tell that an LGBTQ+ couple in a movie is a money-grab is how they act, which we've covered. Another way is to look at other couples in the movie/show.In candyman, the main couple is straight. More likely than not, in a show where there is only one stereotypical gay couple and the main couple is straight, the gay couple is simply a placement money-grab.I don't know why they decided to do this. LGBTQ+ people don't need, nor want to have movies/shows put them in there just to say they put them in there.We just want shows to have LGBTQ+ characters without making them stereotypical or ultra-gay or ""yAsSs QuEeN."" Literally all we want is acknowledgement.That would be like asking someone to get you a water so they get you a water and a bunch of other waters and drinks. No. We don't want all that. We just want a water, this is to much and to fast, we just wanted a water.Anyway, that's all I have to say about Candyman. If you've actually read this far; Wow, good job, dude.I actually think the acting wasn't all that bad in the movie, I believe if the actors played in different movies they would be great, but Candyman is just not it.I debated on giving this 3/10 or 2/10, but I decided on 2/10. I honestly don't know how the critics gave this high ratings, but they are, in the end, critics, and we all know critics will be critics.If you enjoyed Candyman, no hate to you, this was just my opinion. No hate to the movie either, I understand that a lot of people worked very hard on it, and we can't ignore that.My review was show that improvements need to be made and how movies use activism as a money-grab.That's all, bye-bye ! <3.",Candyman
558,lesepling,Incredible,9,5 October 2021,"The user reviews kept me from watching this for a while but I saw it last night and concluded that those users are dumb and frankly, racist. I thought the story was great-it tied in perfectly to the original and had relevant topics...and the horror was unique and terrifying. I like how all the murders were shot through like a mirror or window and left some up to the imagination but there was also the gross out horror with the skin peeling and the tiny holes. I loved it! Great spook.",Candyman
559,qjzznwvwfw,Awfully awfully boring,1,21 September 2021,Whoever made the trailer should be sued for false advertising the best movie I could compare it to would be would be 2020s the grudge. Rob zombies halloween remake is better then this by a million miles.,Candyman
560,MrSAsheC,Double Edged Sword: Good premise BUT poorly executed,4,26 September 2021,"Let's start off with the premise of Candyman, If you're familiar with the OG movie you'll know Candyman was a urban legend that was being investigated by a student (Helen) and what do you know? He proves to exist, creating havoc and murdering those whom say his name in the mirror five times. It wasn't until the second movie you get a visual showing of what happened to him prior to being the Candyman, he was an artist that fell in love with a white woman whom came from a wealthy family, he was eventually killed by locals and hand chopped off and replaced with a hook.Now, the reason I recapped the original and referenced the second movie as a visual cue is for a couple reasons. The first movie compared to this soft sequel/reboot is much more creepier with the fact that Helen is actively looking to prove/disprove this myth and ultimately proves it but in the end she dies. The entire plot of her trying to look in to it made it unsettling, creepy and interesting. As we the audience, didn't know the end game. This one however does something slightly more unnecessary, it takes away from the lore while trying to add to it. Double Edged Sword.In this Candyman the myth is told differently, it shows that there is numerous Candymen throughout history, all of who have been black, innocent of their crimes and murdered. I liked this concept, however by showing there's been Candymen takes away from the lore of it because now the last couple of decades people have known of the Candyman/Copycats. This movie is a lot more on the nose upon my 4th viewing.The cinematography, acting and SFX were fantastic. However, the script and overall plot is this movies biggest weakness. The plot essentially is a recap of the original movie but with a couple of added steps.One of the best and most frustrating scenes was seeing Tony Todd back as the OG Candyman... for a total of 4 seconds. The pacing of the movie is patchy too, you'll see that it's giant leaps from being in the apartment to being duck taped up then not long later, he's levitating by bees.Pros:
Great acting, Beautiful cinematography, Fantastic cosmeticsCons: Movie Pacing, Terrible Script, Tony Todd for 4 seconds, Weak plot, Third act is a total mess.Overall it gets a 4/10. Hopefully in the next decade or so it can be done properly.",Candyman
561,hamidf-56815,Ugh big disappointed,4,17 September 2021,So basically this movie a clapback from all the other horro films where black people die first. In this movie candyman only kills white people. Lmao.,Candyman
562,armoryusmc,Trash movie,2,4 September 2021,"The original is brilliant, this is an insult. Besides the story being complete nonsense, it was rushed through, no lead up into anything.

563,patricksalt,FANTASTIC,10,25 August 2021,"WOW, what a amazing film, truly scary. Everything a candyman would of ever wanted from a sequel. Warning, a VERY brutal film. If you didn't like this movie I would begin to suggest you can't POSSIBLY like slasher films because this is the perfect slasher gory horror film.GO WATCH IT AND SAVE CINEMAS.",Candyman
564,scharp-27996,great,9,30 August 2021,This movie is really good. It has great writing from both Jordan Peele and Nia Dacosta. As well as fantastic cinematography. Comparatively to get out jordan peele can do better. I say this because in get out the only obvious social commentary was what was needed to create the story. Everything else was woven in to be found by anyone looking for it. This movie however is catering to those who disagree with the social commentary. For me it works and i liked it but still it was really in my face about it. That was the only thing wrong. All in all this was still a great movie.,Candyman
565,sethselby-72733,Pretty good film,7,1 September 2021,If you wanna watch a scary movie that has a somewhat coherent plot then this is a good option the flashback scenes were pretty good and the final scene was really cool and bloody all in all a good film.,Candyman
566,leesarashelle,"Worth the Watch, BUT..",8,29 August 2021,"I fully enjoyed the movie and it was worth watching in theaters. Matter fact it's the FIRST movie I have seen in theaters since the start of the pandemic. It really helped me relive one of my all time favorite childhood horrors and black classics. Saying candyman in a black household in the 90s was like saying a curse word. We fully embraced the folk lore of that movie.However I did feel like they failed to fully explain and connect the backstory. There was so much potential there to delve in, that I gladly would have sat to watch another 20-30 minutes of film. There was also flaws in Anthony's character development into candyman. The ending scene with William Burke in the church to me was rather bizarre, it provided explanation but the delivery was poor.With that said I really hope for a sequel.. because there is much to explore.",Candyman
567,angelbrandi-41473,"Forget the haters, this film is good.",7,2 September 2021,"I am a huge fan of Tony Todd and the original Candyman, (seen it over 100 times easily) this film is not horrible like these reviewers want you to believe. Yeah there are some elements in this movie that mirror what's going on (and has been going on throughout history) here in America, same elements the original movie displayed, but most complainers are too dull to connect those dots. If you want to live in your happy space and pretend like racism doesn't exist anymore and everyone is treated the same, then this isn't the movie for you.It is a story of a black man killed by whites because of what they perceived he did to one of their own. That is American history people, Google it! Just because you don't want to be reminded of the atrocities your ancestors committed doesn't mean filmmakers should shy away from it because it makes you ""uncomfortable"". How do you think we feel??For those saying that he only killed whites, so did Tony Todd. Seriously, can you think of one black person that Candyman killed in the original? Or even the sequels (with different directors/writers) for that matter? The closest is Bernadette in the original and Kaci Lemmons is half white. I think that speaks more to whites perceiving blacks as uneducated and gullible, they didn't live in the neighborhood that Candyman terrorized and couldn't sympathize, so summoning him was a joke to them. They died because they weren't ""woke"". Also those complaining that there was too much talking and not enough action, I'm sorry, was the original movie an action flick? No, it was 80% dialogue like this movie. Please don't bash a film because you can't appreciate atmosphere and need constant jump scares, kills and screeching violins to hold your attention.That being said, I absolutely loved 90% of this movie. It was tense the entire time, Candyman himself was definitely scary, creepy and unpredictable due to the fact he didn't talk at all, unlike Tony Todd. I also loved that he was only visible in the mirror, very nice touch. This Candyman started as a possibly mentally challenged man who, due to his sweet intentions, (see what I did there?) is beaten and murdered by racist police because of his affinity to give candy to the children living in Cabrini Green. This candyman carries the abuse he endured on his face as a ghost and I thought that was an excellent way to translate how a sweet man could be turned into a monster through hatred. He is a terrifying and vengeful spirit and unlike Tony Todd, you don't feel sympathetic towards his ghost, only fear.I saw the original movie as a child and I couldn't look into a mirror or sleep with the bathroom door open for years. This movie has awaken that slight fear of mirrors for me once again. Not only mirrors, but I find myself checking reflections in the pictures I have hung around my house, lol.As far as the 10% I didn't like, it is miniscule. If you are a fan of Stephen King novels, and have read Needful things, Revival, Desperation, or The Regulators, then you probably know what I'm going to say. Awesome and amazing story 90% of the way, just ignore the end.",Candyman
568,cmcnabb-43714,It was always going to have heavy themes.,8,3 September 2021,"I can't believe the amount of bad reviews this movie has. It's ridiculous, ignore them all. People are pissed that it's about race and police brutality. When all of the backgrounds of the candy men were! It's a joke people are so angry over it. This movie has some incredible scenes, beautiful score and some very creative story telling. It does not have the attitude of ""all white people are bad"". I never thought that about this movie at all.",Candyman
569,yoderg-59817,Biggest eye roll imaginable,1,4 September 2021,"I thought The First Purge was a horrible political statement, BOY HOWDY was I in for a treat here.I've never seen so much ""white people are evil"" in a movie before this. The ONLY saving grace was the kills, gore and actually making a decent ass antagonist. Other than that, I was audibly groaning to every single anti-white/cops are bad reference made throughout the film.",Candyman
570,yoderg-59817,Loudest 90 minute groan I've ever done,1,4 September 2021,"Where as the original 90s one was an actually interesting, good story telling of a horror movie, this was a simple force feed of a political statement ""teaching"" you of how cops are bad and racist, white people are arrogant and racism against white people is okay and to be accepted.Never seen so much ""woe is me"" on a screen, to the point where I had an audible reaction about every 10 minutes. The ONLY white roles on here were only there to be killed viciously on screen, as if they were silently begging for Jordan Peele to write them off this atrocious film with his coloured pencils.Which brings me to the ONLY saving grace of this film, the violence. If you want some pretty grisly, fun kills and violence, the deaths themselves are pretty cool and well done. But other than that, it's the film equivalent of chewing on rocks for 90 minutes.Given that this film had all the potential in the world, I was expecting a HALWAY decent antagonist with a compelling background, but It seems to me the only intriguing villain of this film was the writers.",Candyman

574,hsmith-00934,Good cinematography but story is trash,2,26 September 2021,"I was pretty excited to see this movie especially with Peele's name attached. However, it was a let down. I don't mind the political message but the horror aspect was completely lost. Honestly if it wasn't named Candyman, it'd be easy to believe this is a completely independent film. Almost every kill is off screen and the story was just nonexistent. I will say the cinematography was enjoyable though.",Candyman
575,reececoupland-69519,Mixing modern issues with a legend.,9,16 September 2021,"With Candyman 2021 while at times can seem chaotic and rushed the overall story does it best while being a fresh telling of the candyman legend also sticks to its original 1992 story.MILD SPOILERS
while the film goes on it seems that the story is following a new rendition of the candyman legacy, this time following a man from the 1970's beaten to death by police for being accused of putting razors in candy. But while this is happening constant mentions of Helen (from the 1992 original) come up saying she was insane and committed the Crimes. Throughout the film whenever the candyman appears it's this rendition only until it is mentioned that the legend of the candyman changes faces but it's original always was the Tony Todd. This connects both the original and this sequel but can still act as a soft reboot cancelling out the original sequels much like the Halloween 2018 did.While many see this film as preachy for its modern themes of racism it is still a clear issue for many people and that's what makes parts of this film relevant for many people.",Candyman

578,Returntothemonke,Heavy handed agenda laden film.,4,14 October 2021,First let me go over the positive aspects of this film. It maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout and has some really interesting supernatural kill scenes involving candyman. Unfortunately even when you take into consideration the positive qualities of this film it is mainly a letdown.The plot is transfixed mainly on racial injustice as a central theme but the point it is making is flawed from the start.One big problem is the almost juvenile racial politics it is pushing. There is no nuance in this film at all. White people are uniformly showcased as bad and black people are depicted as misunderstood or doing bad acts with good intentions. This heavy handedness drags the film down several notches as it fails to make its own point.Candyman as a character has a lot of interesting backstory to it but unfortunately the comically biased depiction takes away from the overall film.,Candyman
579,menacing_turnip,Infuriatingly BAD!,1,18 October 2021,"If this wasnt a candyman movie it would be a 4/10.... If I could give this insult to the IP of candyman a 0/10 I would!So many problems here but to summarise I can get it down to 3 massive issues: -1) Offscreen killsAll but the first kill is implied or off screen... This was clearly to keep the rating down to a PG-13 (or 15 if you live in the UK) because MONEY!.... I mean candyman; REALLY - you want a 15 rating for candyman? NO!2) Wacky TwistsThey took the original concept and tried to put a spin on it.... This is a no spoilers review so I wont get into it but it REALLY didnt work. It was actually a half interesting idea and COULD have worked if it was handled by storytellers with EPIC talent but we dont have those anymore.... By the final scene the plot is so damn convoluted and lost in itself you're just like ""Yeah, whatever....""3) Tony ToddHe's in the movie.... For about 5 seconds (no joke). Why? I mean it ties in to point No.2 here so I cant get into it but Tony Todd MADE the originals - that dude is literally nightmare fabric personified... WHY IS HE NOT IN THIS MOVIE?.... And yeah - its woke and wants to give you a lesson. This isnt entertainment; its education for the unwashed masses.Do yourself a favour and watch the original 1992 version: it still holds up today FX wise and is genuinely scary in places.... Definitely dont waste your time with this soulless husk of a coorporate cash grab.",Candyman

Believe it, the ending completely wrecked this movie.My girl and i paid for this last weekend. She's a fan of the original, i walked into it blind.Hell, i suggested it. And we were able to look past the negatives that other reviews list, all up until the ending.Someone here mentioned 'driving our country even further apart'.

583,mac519,Trying to give an honest review,5,23 October 2021,"Most reviewers I see saying it's too political. I didn't really have any issues there but I couldn't help but keep thinking how disappointed I was afterwards. In the beginning they bring up Cabrini Green has been gentrified. As someone being around lots of gentrification and its sad effects I thought this was a really interesting issue that really isn't talked about and was personally invested. Moreover, it's perfect for Candyman. How do they explore this? Well, they just kind of say it.Very soon after this is introduced: surprise, we learn why Candyman's face wasn't shown in marketing. Tony Todd is no longer Candyman but it's a new character who was a victim of police brutality. Guess this is the theme now. How is this explored? To the same degree as the last theme. Also they give a shrug and explain it as just they're both Candyman and independently wore the same outfit and had hooks so that this movie can still call itself a sequel.The protagonist goes to the library and gets Helen's notes from the first movie and I was excited to see the reference to the great original film, and now he's going to follow in her footsteps. Her notes are never referenced again. His girlfriend's dad committed suicide we learn in a sad flashback. This is not referenced again. It really just goes nowhere with anything.Ultimately a great Philip Glass score and being pretty looking doesn't change that this movie just for some reason doesn't really seem to understand you can't just mention a theme to have it. You have to do something with it.",Candyman

The original is also political, but I suppose not everyone has seen that. Knowing that Jordan Peele (the writer if you didn't know) is a huge fan of the original, would explain a lot about the similar social commentary. Candyman was always about social commentary. It's unfortunate if societal truths make you uncomfortable as the viewer. Great film, check it out.",Candyman

After my viewing I loved it. It was shot beautifully, it has great acting and it really built on the Candyman legend. It wasn't scary as much as it was a drama thriller for horror enthusiast. I feel like any seasoned horror film fan will not be scared, but I felt very engaged with the overall story and the mythos behind Candyman. It felt very personable for me,maybe because of my love for the original.

I was beyond thrilled to watch this sequel and sorely disappointed because I couldn't watch it last year. When I learned the movie theaters was going to open back up, I bugged my sister to loco about coming with me to the movie to see it. Tonight, I am grateful that she didn't have to sit through with what I watched.Let's start from the beginning. When it first came on, I immediately knew it wasn't going to be a dark film. The music and lighting gave me a sense that I was getting ready to watch a family movie vs an actual horror. Anyways, as the movie continued, I noticed immediately that the Candyman in this movie was NOT Tony Todd. Someone on another thread mentioned that Tony Todd is older now. In my opinion, that would've made it all the more scarier. Then we learn the Candyman we see in this movie came about from policemen beating a candy distributor to death and basically disfigured him.This storyline is NOT in sync with the original movie! This part shouldn't have not been in the script! If it's supposed to be a sequel, the plot should follow the original story.To me, it was like they were shoving the reality of police brutality in our faces. The writers could've easily exemplified the ""original"" origin of Candyman and made it sort of like a vengeance story. Or the very least, the writers could've wrote a death scene at the beginning by the Tony Todd's Candyman after he was summoned. THEN let Antony's life go downhill by making him look like he was the killer vs the flesh eating germ he had. The beginning was very weak and a foreshadowing of what came next.Then there's a mention about Helen Lyles. I'm not sure if the guy gave fictitious information to throw Antony off course or not but I was like where in the hell did that information he gave him come from??? Was this part in the plot a typo??? I kept asking myself this.The string of murders that happened shortly after that was cheesy, predictable, and lame. The four girls in the bathroom included. To me, that was more comical than anything.The writers did Vanessa Williams a BIG injustice by not giving her enough screen time. It was so many ways she could've been immersed into this movie. And Tony Todd appearance at the very end was a little too much, a little too late, and may I add funny asf. Like why??? Why they stained his legacy like this?I can sort of see where the writers were going with the Antony storyline. I really do, but they had an extra year to flesh this movie out. The plot lacked depth, subliminal symbolism as it relates to racism, consistency, clarity, darkness, and scare. It feels like a bunch of people tried to dictate how this movie was going to go which led it to being a hot ass mess.I'm only giving this movie 3 stars because the actors and acting was great and felt authentic. They had to work with what they were given unfortunately. The acting was the only redeeming quality of this movie.

It feels like a bunch of people tried to dictate how this movie was going to go which led it to being a hot ass mess.I'm only giving this movie 2 stars because the actors and acting was great and felt authentic. They had to work with what they were given unfortunately. The acting was the only redeeming quality of this movie. Otherwise, I would consider it literary garbage that completely f'ed up the Candyman franchise.",Candyman
596,ste3457,Extremely disappointing,1,2 September 2021,"So bad it made me write an IMDB review for the first time.I'm a big fan of the original, I've lost count of the amount of times I've watched it. This was unbelievably lacklustre in comparison.I spent a lot of the movie debating whether to walk out. Nearly all gore is off camera, and it just seems to drone on and on about art. The less than handful of times I expected the movie to ramp up, it quickly switched back down to first gear again. The character development felt extremely weak, and the memorable
score from the original felt lost in translation.It didn't draw me in at all throughout. I was really looking forward to this for a long, long time. Such a wasted opportunity. I wouldn't make a cinema trip for it, I regret doing so. Hopefully the new Halloween will
make up for this poor 'horror' showing in 2021.",Candyman
597,torreschristopher030,Not What I Thought,6,6 September 2021,"This review is coming from a huge fan of the original. The original scared me so much and had true elements of horror incorporated into it but this film is nothing like it. I'll start with the cons. The problem this movie has is that it tries too hard to be ""woke"" and to be about race. It's not subtle at all. We barely see Candyman in the film and don't really get a good view of the kills. The movie is also not scary at all and feels more like a drama film than horror. The kills are shot in a way that never fully shows it which takes away the effect and there are barely any kills. Candyman is only seen about two times in this whole film and is rarely actually seen on camera. Another big issue I had with the film is that the third act made absolutely no sense and felt like they were doing anything to finally get some more kills in there. It felt like we were missing scenes from the movie as some scenes didn't match up with others and some things made absolutely no sense. Very confusing and crazy. Now with the pros! The direction was beautiful as it was shot in a very pretty way and made the whole film look like an art piece. The opening shot of the guy coming out of the wall with the hook in his hand was probably the scariest moment of the film. All I can say is this move is not what you think it is and isn't worth the movie ticket!",Candyman
598,Gstrongheart,Amazing,10,31 August 2021,I saw the first Candyman 19 years ago and was hooked.Going back to the cinema to watch this new one was just as great as the first time. The film was beautifully made the cinematography was amazing some scenes blow my mind and the actors were superb couldn't have chosen a better cast. It is one for my DVD collection.Thoroughly enjoyed this film and to see it with my grownup children wax also a treat. Fantastic film Nia can't wait for more of this women films.,Candyman

601,eficzek007,The fact these reviews don't know the difference between politics and social issues says a lot about their ignorance and biased point of view,7,18 September 2021,"The movie was solid, nothing to write home about but good as far as modern horror goes. The social commentary was not at all subtle which is a shame. If you always need to be terrified by a horror film this is not the movie I would recommend but it had some cool kills and the ending was pretty spooky. To address the hate this movie gets regarding it's social commentary - how can anyone who knows the original expect anything else from this movie? Not only is the story based in black trauma, we live in an era where you just can't avoid making this sequel without addressing these issues. As I said before though it was not subtle and I suppose it can get tiresome for some but I didn't feel that way at all.",Candyman
602,edd-martinas,Proof that Jordan Peele's movies are not scary,4,2 September 2021,"I went to watch this movie, knowing the original is a scary classic & thinking a remake would be even scarier. I really thought this movie had potential. But then I realized Jordan Peele is involved in this and even though I still gave it a chance, it disappointed me.This is a big middle finger to the original. I appreciate Peele's values and the way he wants to make the white audience aware of the fact that racism still exists in America, but he forgot to make the movie... scary.The fact that candyman was a ghost visible only through mirrors was the biggest turn off. And also, the way he killed white people only was amusing, even though, in the original, he kills black people too.On the bright side, unlike the original, which scared me when I was younger, this remake helped me get over my fear of saying ""Candyman"" 5 times in the mirror.",Candyman
603,liljess-20522,A Reimagining by a great director/ team,9,28 August 2021,Don't let these negative comments deter you from watching this reimagined classic.

606,mcoley-72325,Yikes,3,31 August 2021,It was bound to happen eventually. Jordan Peeled name was going to be attached to a bad movie. This thing was predictable from the very opening shot If you had seen the first Candyman. Just nothing scary. Mostly just a bunch of absurd nonsense.,Candyman

608,jpgarcia-58806,Tony Todd is what saved the memory of this movie,2,6 November 2021,Thought the visuals were nice and the storytelling good. But they wanted to portray this as such a racist movie that it ruins it. Let movies be movies and save your political views for the toilet. Tony Todd showing up at the end of the movies is all that's saves this movie.,Candyman
609,samuelparsons-05438,6/10,6,23 September 2021,"Before we start, I just want to say I'm a big Jordan Peele fan. I think as a comedy writer he was hilarious and now he has delved into horror films and completely amazed and terrified time and time again. This was a little bit of a let down.First, the plot. It was okay. It follows in a similar vein to Get Out and Us in that it has major themes of black oppression. And I think that's another reason why I love Peele. But whilst the others felt like a natural link between the storyline and this key theme, Candyman felt a bit like it was peg that had been forced to fit a round hole. In the others, whilst the comparisons may have been subtle, this time they were screaming it at you continuously and maybe that was the intent but it felt a little forced. And that in turn, took focus away from the horror element which felt minimal.However, an incredible performance for most of the actors (ironically the one actor Mariah thought wasn't great was one of the only white characters in the film). I really want to but give Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who played the lead incredibly and has now made me want to go through his back catalogue and watch his other films (if anyone has recommendations, they are welcome). I also want to mention Nia DaCosta who really showcased her talent as a director. I've talked a lot about Jordan Peele because of his writing credits but the film is as much DaCosta's, arguably more, and she deserves credit for the enjoyable parts.Honestly, this film was okay. I left it IMDB'ing everything which is always a good sign. However, don't go to watch it if you're up for a horror-based extravaganza because that's not really what this film is about.",Candyman
610,randygray-06576,This isn't a reboot,7,27 August 2021,I really wish people understood that this movie wasn't a reboot but a sequel. Used some of the original cast and story which was about racism if you knew the original story not just the murders. It seems like from what people are saying they're upset because they missed the racial undertones of the first 3 films. Good job on the continued story but the kills seemed tame compared to the original movies.,Candyman
611,randygray-06576,"This is NOT a reboot, it's a sequel.",7,27 August 2021,I wish people understood what the story was truly about in the original films. They clearly seem upset about the racial undertones of this movie when the original was also about racism and how government housing was in Chicago in the 90s. Also the back story about how he was killed was also about how black people couldn't date white people. So the movie is a sequel that uses some original cast and story. Good job telling the story that is the original but I did think the deaths were tame compared to the 1992 original.,Candyman
612,TonyHeisenberg,Can the Candyman?,5,28 August 2021,Based on other reviews I don't believe it is a waste of time. The bar is set extremely low for horror movies nowadays so this movie surpasses most within those elements. It has very enjoyable moments brought on from the direction and gruesomeness of some scenes and good acting from the main cast. But the #1 thing it does do is lack creative writing. It recycles the same story points continuously. The movie is very fast and to the point which isn't bad but it loves to use the same story motives from the first 5 minutes. All secondary characters are written very shallow and just won't move you in any way. The climax is gone before you know it as well and really flops at the very end.Rent it.,Candyman
613,paquettececilia,Low ratings reveal nothing but ignorance and fear,9,30 September 2021,"This was a brilliant piece woven into the original lore of Candyman. They way it attaches itself to the original film is subtle and smart. It was stylish, heart wrenching, and extremely poignant. It wasn't as gory and terrifying as the original, but I think that was one of it's strengths. The sense of dread you feel watching this is not triggered by blood and guts but by real suspense, unsettling images, and the distinct fear that the real root of the problems amongst the characters are the same problems amongst us all. Was it a slow burn like others say? Sorta-as slow as a 90 minute film could be; I was craving more. It's outrageous to me that people walked out of this, but at the same time, it's extremely telling. Those most critical are obviously the most threatened. The poor reviews made me want to see this more and I was not wrong. It was excellent, smart, suspenseful, chilling, and important. Tell.

It doesn't work at all and it's totally cringely pandering to current day racial politics.Bad film, doesn't work, you've probably already seen Candyman but have you read the original Cliver Barker short story?

622,johnschirmer,Disappointing Sequel,3,29 August 2021,"Did not like it as much as the original. It was not scary at all. The new Candyman actor was not as intimidating as Tony Todd. I felt there was too much killing. One of the things I liked most about the original was the low body count, I felt it kept the suspense high. The more violence there is, the less effective I felt it was. I don't know, just didn't care for it very much. Also, the fact the cops did not immediately start investigating Anthony after the first murder was just goofy to me.",Candyman
623,zo-78168,SHAME ON THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS ANYTHING LESS THAN 7,8,10 October 2021,"Disclaimer - I have not watched any of the previous movies in this franchise.My girlfriend who is an avid horror fan was curious about this, then I kept hearing about it from people around - watched the trailer - rented it for 20 bucks after a long days work (on set) and enjoyed every minute of it.The cinematography was beautiful, the sound design was immersive, and the writing was well done in terms of planting seeds and twists and turns. The style over all in terms of art direction and wardrobe was a cherry on top if you appreciate those types of things.If you are looking for horror in the classic fashion, this is not it. If you like suspense and gore this will satisfy your appetite.But why I really love this film, other than the style, is how Jordan Peele has turned the horror/slasher genre into something special. And he's doing it consistently. The subtle social commentary (if you aren't too dense to catch it) is really thought provoking and the manner in which its executed is entertaining.While he did not direct it, I'm sure he knew what the vision was and supported the people who made it happen, which in itself is beautiful.I approve. Well worth the $ to enjoy this in my home with my lady, pups and a couple glasses of Mezcal.*This would be a good intro for people who think they can't watch scary movies.TELL EVERYONE.",Candyman

I do dig how this film has created a mix reaction. I think films with this type of reaction makes me more eager to it compare to a film that's unanimously loved but I think this film is going to grow on people overtime, for example horror films like Jacob's Ladder, Angel heart and the original Candyman. My only really major flaw with this film that it felt too short and rushed. This was a film that was shown to a test audience that's probably why the runtime is somewhat reduce.

All the triggered white reviewers claiming the movie was ""racist"" obviously do not understand the horror that Jordan Peele creates- a mixture of conventional horror with the horrific realities that BIpoc face in within the constructs of white supremacy- mainly the Black experience. Jordan Peele is not afraid ""to go there"" knowing his movies are not for the fragile minded.He also tastefully created a modern addition to the Candyman lore which does not take away from all other Candyman films. 10/10.",Candyman
658,staticsupp,"It sure is funny how the ""low"" ratings seem to come from",6,30 August 2021,"Butthurt white folks? Isn't it ironic that the low ratings and ""wokeness"" complaints all happen to be from the ""this movie is mean to white folks"" crowd? Well, sorry, but welcome to the ""Black"" experience and what we have dealt with for decade after decade. If storytelling from the Black person's perspective is that upsetting to you, maybe you should avoid movies with Black directors and leads, and stay in your safe space..wherever that may be.YES ""gentrification"" sucks.YES it's true that Black people were crammed into particular areas of town and forced to live there with little to no city services.YES rich developers decided they wanted these areas back and raised the property taxes so high that the poor people that lived there couldn't afford them.YES now there's a ""Whole Foods"" and ""Starbucks"" on every corner there now.YES, sometimes the police HAVE ""shot first and asked questions later"" when it comes to people of color.Truth hurts sometimes. And admitting the obvious doesn't make you ""woke""Sorry..Does ANY of that mean ""white people are bad""? Nope, but doesn't make ""redlining"" (google it) any less true.Now, having said all that, the movie itself the was ""Meh"". Not scary at all, and in no way comparable to the 1992 movie. A few plot holes here and there..but the acting was great.",Candyman

It tries to convey certain themes of race and has an interesting twist, that there is more than one Candyman so to speak. Some character decisions are quite dumb at times and the writing towards the end gets pretty bad. Overall a good watch, can be scary at times and the gore is ok, it doesn't show everything all the time and some of the kills are once again shot creatively and amazingly. It is not going to be like the original, the only thing that has stayed the same is the world of the story and Tony Todd, although he is only in it for about 5 seconds.",Candyman

663,williamktf,Flawed Story but well directed and entertaining enough,6,30 August 2021,"Flawed but fine. The direction is very sharp on Nia DeCosta's part. The story and script have their problems. It spends two brief scenes announcing it's opinion to you, which is what people are calling heavy handed. While it could be better integrated it wasn't burdensome to me. There are two characters who exist only to explain the plot in dialogue dump scenes. They overly entangle the characters in small world story telling. One side character (art curator lady) is amusingly bad in her mercifully short scenes. She is obviously just reading lines. The backstory to establish Candyman's motivations doesn't really conclude in him becoming a slasher killer by my logic. That all said it's still a fairly entertaining watch as a horror film and has a message to convey. The people saying this movie hates white people are funny. The film's protest of gentrification is grounded in pretty straightforward history. And if you're paying attention you'll notice the film takes a few shots on goal toward black people too (art judge scene).Good: direction, cinematography, atmosphere, lead actors, atmosphere
Bad: Script, Script, Script.",Candyman

665,CasinoGoodFellas,Triggered are we?,7,31 August 2021,"Mmmmmmm its music to my ears hearing the old white people complaining about the ""wokeness"" of this movie, for anyone who doesn't care what the Tories/Republicans think this film is a pretty good sequel to its 1992 predecessor and does a good job building upon the originals lore with a few pleasing tie-ins while also addressing the undertones from the first film of racial mistreatment and gentrification that the African-American people suffered and continue to suffer under Americas under-qualified police and content boomers. While these issues are more prevalent in the 2021 reboot and brings them further to the forefront, those who call it ""wokeness"" and say the film is ""Too political"" or ""pushing an agenda"" I have some big news for you. Shhhh don't tell anyone but most the films you watch have an underlining meaning a lot of which will most likely be political in nature, However I must congratulate you, it seems you have managed to understand the meaning of this film even if you don't agree with its message I reward you with a gold star ⭐ (it should go well with your childish beliefs)",Candyman

The production, the creativity, the way the old film tied into this one...phenomenalI'm not sure why people are calling it racist? They simply told a story of how black men were treated during my father's childhood. I'm amazed to see how many people dislike history when it makes THEIR ancestors look like the bad guys. To each it's own.Watch this movie! It's dope. I want to see it again.",Candyman
671,carlos-43240,Worst Ever,1,5 September 2021,"This movie was walk out worthy, the only reason we didn't is cause I thought it couldn't get worse. I was wrong. It wasn't scary, made minimal sense and did I say not scary? It also clearly was catering to the racial justice organizations. Horror genre films need to have a villain of some type, they couldn't decide if Candyman was a good or bad guy, but clearly one race throughout the film was made to appear bad, hateful and dumb. Save your time, it's not worth it.",Candyman
672,leonardoairoldi,Beyond the politics,4,5 September 2021,"The movie was quite a disappointment, the scenography was a + and actors played their part well. The real issue was the plot that was flat and ends with one of the most cliche and unrealistic situations.

I'm wondering if the people behind this even saw the original. In the orginal I thought the voice alone was frightning. Nope, not this one. It took me right back to watching a live Madonna concert (looking at my watch wondering when this will end??) I'm wondering if the Marvel Comapny is in talks about making Candyman a superhero??

In classic Jordan Peele style, it is a slow burn and the real horror comes when the viewer understands in a visceral way how terrifying it has been to be black in America since the beginning. Yes, it's political, but they are trying to help us feel the terror. Isn't that exactly what we came for? I loved it. The cinematography, the subtlety, the acting, the freaking timing. It was a masterpiece.",Candyman

680,brittonreid,A Disappointment From Many Angles,4,12 September 2021,"I, as many other viewers were, was very excited to see this film. I love the original film, and I love Jordan Peele's work. However, at the end of the movie, I left feeling dissatisfied at what was presented.Firstly, some positives. I very much enjoyed the slow pans and zooms of the camerawork, and the cinematography was excellent. I thought MOST of the actors played the script they were given well, and the CGI was as good as you'd expect it to be. The soundtrack wasn't anything to write home about, but it did it's job well enough. Unlike many other reviews I've seen, I didn't think the political undertones (if you can call them undertones) were too distracting, but I did think they pulled away from what the movie really should've been.Then, the negatives. Let's start of with some basics: the sound design was horrendous, to say the least. The movie couldn't ever seem to decide if it wanted to have me put in a hearing aid or if it wanted to deafen me, the latter being much too common during the moments of suspense. Note that I saw this film in theaters, so my TV speakers were not an issue. On the topic of suspense, let's talk about how little there was. I did not feel scared even once while watching this movie. Not a single moment where the Candyman was on screen did I feel like I was in the shoes of the victims, desperately trying to escape. This may be attributed to the lackluster slasher elements of the film, in which I can only recall two of the deaths being explicitly shown to the audience, the rest either being at a distance or off-screen. To this point, the Candyman hardly seemed like much of a threat at all. His actions were mostly relegated to the confines of mirrors, contrasted with the original movie in which he could (and often did) move freely. As a side note, I believe it was Brian King's (?) character of Crive Privler (the man who ran the art gallery, one of the earlier deaths in the film) who had the worst acting. His performance was fine enough up until the scene of his death, where either his direction or his acting itself completely drops in quality, with such classic lines as ""Is this real? This is real!"" and, ""Must go faster! Must go faster!"", both being performed with the quality of a B-Movie side character.TL;DR Likely least enjoyed by people who watched the original. Maybe watch it in a year or two where you can stream it for cheap.",Candyman
681,zacharyesanders,What happened to horror...,2,12 September 2021,The reimaging of this sequel to the original was good until the ending. Took a good idea and turned it into all about race. What happened to Candyman being a horror film? It has become like everything else and is about how the white man is bad... This is a shame that all this a political film and NOT a horror film...,Candyman
682,caseyleighmansell,Disappointing sequel,2,12 September 2021,"The film is extremely ambitious but unfortunately misses the mark, was very eager to see this movie, however the plot of the film was long winded and boring. There were clear undertones in the film highlighting racial injustice and themes also highlighting police brutality and injustice towards black people in general in America, likely inspired by recent racial tensions. The film gives off impressions that it is more of an Origin movie telling a tale of who the candy man is more than anything. Unfortunately, in tying this into the film much of the scare factor is lost and the film lacks true fright factor and ability to keep the viewer engaged.",Candyman

I was extremely pleasantly surprised.The Idea that socio-political commentary can't be scary baffles me, ok it's not an unadulterated slasher fest but a) slashers aren't actually scary and b) the original is not a slasher.The truth is we live in an age of desensitization where it is hard to be scared of horror anymore, if that's all you're after then maybe this isn't for you (but what mainstream film is these days?).

The cinematography through out the entirety of the film gave me goosebumps and a major adrenaline rush. The references to the first one also gave me chills.

I couldn't focus on the scary parts of the film with all of the ""white people are bad"" messages in it. Majority of the kill scenes are hidden and you only hear what is going on.

Emotional and a privilege to watch in the sadly empty cinema all on my own. A must-see legend!""I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom! Without these things, I am nothing.

I think the social commentary was definitely very well done throughout the movie and was more than a good watch. The story was compelling, I liked seeing the characters interact, but it's main weakness honestly is the horror. It feels conflicted between horror and thriller. There is some great body horror, the kills are frightening and the Candyman is terrifying whenever he shows up, but later on it becomes more suspenseful and feels like a slow burn until the last third. My thoughts may change if I watch it again.I think a lot of films like this have to strike a balance between being legitimately scary films to watch and also developing complex story and characters for the social commentary they want to deliver. Get Out for example deals with something more subtle and nuanced like perceptions of the black body while Candyman deals with police brutality and gentrification which are more violent and tangible.",Candyman

707,summerwertz,"Peoples' acclamation of blatantly bad movies is bringing us closer and closer to that scene in Idiocracy where they're watching a movie called ""A**.""",1,29 September 2021,"Idk what's going on but I've seen this trend unfolding for a few years now. There's a scene in Idiocracy:(""And the #1 movie in the country was called ""Ass."" And that's all it was for 90 minutes. It won eight Oscars that year, including best screenplay."" Ass is a movie featured in the Mike Judge film Idiocracy. It consists of a man standing in front of a camera, with his buttocks in full view. Occasionally his farts can be heard.)Last night I saw Candyman (2021) and Im glad I didn't pay for it because it's the worst movie I've seen since I saw 'Call Me By Your Name' last year. I incorrectly thought this film was one of Jordan Peele, but he was the screenwriter and producer and a new comer Nia DaCosta was the director.Im a big fan of Jordan Peele's previous horror films. They're more psychological horror and I love that they tackle social commentary that leaves you thinking about them for days and weeks after watching. They're contested by some but I thoroughly enjoyed them and I was even willing to give DaCosta an unbiased watch on Candyman. I was a little worried that the film was short but had high hopes. Case in point, Halloween (1978) by then newcomer John Carpenter.This ended up being one of the worst films I've ever seen and I think the only reason so many people are praising it is because it lead to DaCosta being recognized as the first black woman that directed a #1 film. Which is a wonderful accomplishment but jfc why did it have to be this film?Look, I fully support BLM. I support critical race theory. I voluntarily took and thoroughly enjoyed African American history classes at my college. I can talk about the differences between Booker T Washington vs W. E. B. DuBois and MLK vs. Malcolm X. I can talk about how the Black Panthers are the original creators of the Free School Lunch Program. I love learning about issues we face and doing my due diligence to be an ally and bring change.This movie was pure social commentary. It wasn't subtle and it wasn't deep. I don't mind brutally bare without hand holding to illicit feelings in the audience but this is a heavy handed tool that should be used sparingly to enhance the story and add value without causing everything to become watered down. I don't mind surface level commentary when it isn't the driving force of the entire film. It seemed like DaCosta didn't have enough film experience to execute this film the way she wanted to. She painted the entire film heavy handedly with constant social commentary on gentrification, police brutality, etc. To the point that it became distracting and every other element of the film fell into the background. Characters and themes were introduced and then never brought up again or elaborated on. Towards the end we are running out of time so we paraphrase the film into a lackluster ending.The original Candyman didn't have to babystep the audience through its themes and social commentary. It was artistically layered into the film so that the audience leaves thinking about it after it's over. The remake is like someone elbowing you every few minutes and reminding you that gentrification is destroying historically black neighborhoods and police are massacring black Americans every day. It's almost insulting that DaCosta didn't feel comfortable enough in the audience to trust that they'd get this without making it so exaggerated and theatric. Or she just wasn't comfortable in her own directing experience to execute it more artistically and subtly. Either way it shows.DaCosta should have made a documentary rather than turning a sequel into a poor substitute for one. This movie shouldn't have been one that allowed our first black woman to direct a #1 film. It's a horrible movie. It's just pathetic that this film won the community this award. And I think the only reason it has is because people are afraid to criticize it because they'll be called racist. Some people calling it out are racists because they just don't like the commentary. The commentary isn't the issue. It's how it's executed. That's why it's a bad movie.I just don't understand people. Idk what's going on. Maybe years of daily dosing on social media and tiktok is rotting peoples' brains away. But I keep seeing this trend of terrible movies that are so explicit in their message and surface level being praised. Being called so artistic and deep. You call it out and people are like ""You just don't get it!"" No. There's nothing to get. It's like when people smoke weed and come up with ""smart"" high revelations like ""If I had two left hands but was right handed, how could I write?"" They think it sounds smart until the next day when they think about it and realize that's stupid af. Except people gate keep and simp these types of films without ever realizing they're just bad.

Every piece of the commentary however, was very surface level and added nothing new to the conversation. The artwork in the movie was lazy, and the writers clearly had no clue about art or the topic they attempted to talk about. It focused much more on this conversation than any horror elements and seemed to forget it was a horror movie for most of the run time. It attempted to use cheap gore to make up for the lack of creativity to scare an audience or at least creep them out. It also seems they couldn't decide on if they wanted a story of a black struggle or a tormented artist and failed in both regards. A disgraceful effort by Jordan Peele to capitalize on what gave him a good reputation and a waste of a great character.",Candyman

I was excited for this remake as the first seemed like it suffered from a lower budget but instead was treated to a working pile of garbage, with a bigger budget. All I wanted was a great remake but instead i got a terrible attempt at a remake. If your a true fan of horror movies think terrible remake of nightmare on elm street on steroids.

717,christianmb-83426,Something to pass the time,7,1 November 2021,"This version of Candyman, which you may or may not know, is the supposed direct sequel to the original candy man film from 1992 starring Tony Todd as The Candyman. This new movie had a lot of elements that I liked, especially the opening credits, which featured the song The Candyman by Sammy Davis Junior. All of the logos of the production companies were backward as if one was looking at a mirror, a reference to how one summons Candyman. I wish Anthony were more relatable, his life seems a little too unbelieved, but then again, it's a movie for entertainment in the end.The cameras were a little too perfect and bright. Despite their somewhat shaky reviews, I wish it was more gritty and engaging like Halloween or Conjuring movies with extraordinary filmography and sequence. Moving on, this movie was too self-aware. The original was about the gentrification and oppression of black people and how artists ""white people"" use people's struggles for personal gain. This is evident at the beginning of the movie when they say it straight up. The first movie was hidden in the premise of the original and the original origin story. This new movie felt like I was watching CNN or Fox. There is no nuance. It gave you the message initially and said, this is what we are going to deal with it. I wish this movie followed in the steps of ""Us"" instead of ""Get Out."" Overall I enjoyed it was something to pass the time. I wouldn't put any merit into it to win any awards. Candyman in the movie wasn't an entity till the end of the movie. He was like ghosts killing people, which was cool, but it wasn't satisfying. When it came to a slasher horror film, I appreciate the excellent ol the villain being on screen when it happens. If you are looking for a good movie on Friday night, recommend this movie, but if you are expecting a catching sequel to a great movie, you will be disappointed.",Candyman

So far, I've just felt like I'm attending lectures about how bad white people are. This whole movie didn't scare me, it just constantly had me thinking about racial tensions and gentrification etc etc. I didn't care about any of the characters, white or black or otherwise. It didn't scare, it didn't say enough about whatever his message that he was trying so hard to send to white viewers for that to stick. I mean, what?

723,Sundown93,Two Sides of a Coin,9,29 August 2021,"Finally, a sequel that stays true to the spirit of the original while giving us something new!As a longtime horror fan, I have grown tired of seeing the same stories play out using a familiar bag of tricks (cough cough Conjuring) I have also grown weary of the onslaught of modern reboots which fail to understand the essence of their source material and what makes them special. As a longtime fan of the original, I was nervous...Candyman 2021 is the perfect companion piece to the 92 original. However, instead of relying on nostalgia and repeated story beats, the film serves as an inverse to the story, right from its opening credit sequence. This time, instead of looking down at the Cabrini Greene projects, Nia Dacosta places the camera looking up at the beautifully melancholic high rises of modern day Chicago. This sets the tone for the film's artful descent into madness and ultimately, cathartic journey towards reclaiming a narrative.Alot has changed since 1992, yet many horrors remain just as relevant. Candyman is wise enough to acknowledge this. Much like the original, this new film plays on the broken telephone effect of urban legends. It's a clever tool to expand the story and take things into new and interesting directions.The gorgeous cinematography and unnerving new score (accompanied by the original theme from Phillip Glass) perfectly transpose the spirit of the original film into the modern day. There are no jump scares here. Instead, the filmmakers aim to get under your skin (literally).There's a lot to unpack here but it's best to just let the film put you under its spell. It's a hauntingly beautiful journey that will surely warrant repeat viewings.Nia DaCosta's Candyman is a masterfully crafted, intelligent horror film. There really isn't anything quite like it and in a genre full of oversaturated reruns, this is a real treat.Don't listen to the angry neckbeards who are review bombing. This is the sequel we need and deserve.",Candyman

730,chrismap23,Bitterly disappointed.,2,1 September 2021,"I want to start by saying i am a big fan of the original candyman movie for its uneasy atmospheric tones. It really got under my skin. I had such high hopes for this new take/sequel of sorts to the original and with jordon peele linked to this movie,i thought it was a dead set to be a great. However, from very early on, i realised how politically motivated this movie was going to be. There was some dialogue in the first 15 minutes around race/white supremacy that took me out of the movie instantly. It took me about 10 minutes to think of anything else, but lucky for me, there was not much to miss. By all means, add a wink or nod to your polical views, but i wish this film could have concentrated on being a good horror film and have some decent scares. The plot was all over the place and although the two main actors were clearly talented, they were given such an awful script in this movie. Most of the death scenes were either from a distance or off screen, im actually laughing to myself as i write that. I wish the creators had left candyman out of this film, odd statement for a candyman film, but it was not scary one bit, with too much emphasis on politics. I Honestly feel very disappointed to have gone to see this in the cinema. What a waste of time and money. Its a hard avoid for anyone who loves the original film.",Candyman
731,caponetone14,If you're white your dead,1,28 October 2021,This movie was slow and wasn't even scary the whole focus of this movie instead of horror is racism. This movie only victims are white people if a white person was on screen you can predict they were gonna die the fact that this attacked one race made me sick to my stomach because if it was the other way around about a movie where a white killer only killed black victims there would be outrage from the black community it's a complete double standard and made me give this a low rating I wish I saved my money.,Candyman

While the acting was very good as well as the story, once again Hollywood sticks it's "" wokeism "" fingers in the mix and we see a movie full of blame the police and blame the white man.

733,trftrf,Horrible times for art and creation.,4,26 September 2021,"While Clive Barker's short story ""The Forbidden"", which the first movie was based on, revolved around the British class system, the first movie already revolved about racial problems. However, back in the early nineties, they managed to treat the subject in a much subtler manner. The movie was not as lecturing, patronizing and totally over the top with the subject as the 2021 version. This one is really serving every diversity, race, and ""bad white men"" cliché that have grown into a fashion lately. Everyone killed is white because they are all represented as despicable people:The arrogant gallery owner and his drug addict girlfriend.The condescending art critic who tells Anthony: ""your kind are the real pioneers of that cycle"" (luckily, she added ""artists,"" even though it's clearly implied that she might have meant ""people of colour"").The four white bullyish girls in high school who were mean to the black girl in the booth. Luckily, the Asian girl left the room after the third Candyman, so she was spared.And not to forget, the police officers, who are all racist by nature.The one white main cast member who was spared, Troy's boyfriend, was probably spared, because he was gay.It is really a pity because the movie has nice cinematography and imagery. But none of that will be remembered. The only thing viewers will remember is the over-the-top diversity and racial touch of the movie. The one group because it caters to them and the other group because it is repulsed by this new trend in creation. So, overall, this kind of movie does nothing but further grow the abyss between the one and the other group. Thus, creating more despise and hate instead of reconciling people.Art has often, if not always, been political. But what is currently happening, is just abysmal. Cater to the ""fashionable and correct"" opinion and you are good. But don't you dare create something that goes against currently acceptable opinions, or you are ""cancelled.""Horrible times for art, perfectly illustrated by this movie!",Candyman

735,hogwarts16,"Well directed, not too heavy handed",8,28 August 2021,"Although the argument can be made that this new entry in the Candyman series is not as subtle as the first film, it is no less contemplative. What it lacks in nuance, it makes up for with fantastic directing from Nia DaCosta. I can promise you it is leagues better than anything the first 2 sequels dished out.Some of the visuals are truly haunting, especially the shadow puppetry anytime it comes into play; sit through the end credits is all I'll say. On top of the directing, the cast here is really good, with Coleman Domingo being a particular standout. It interestingly shirks cetrain tropes and cliches. One character in particular I was certain had slasher victim written all over them yet they narrowly avoid a grim fate; you'll know who it is when you see the film.Best of all the film has it's own identity whilst building on the story and themes of the original. At barely over 90 minutes it is a breezy, albeit abruptly short sit. It may come off of preachy to some, but DaCosta and producer/writer Jordan Peele have made a chilling new entry for the horror classic, in the same vein as Halloween (2018), that will definitely have audiences talking.",Candyman

742,ungewinster-452-443523,excellent handling of the mythos,10,27 August 2021,"I just came back from a screening of Candyman and I utterly, utterly enjoyed it.I only recently rewatched the original which this one essentially picks up from, disregarding the previous sequels. It feels very much in the spirit of the first one, sometimes a compelling mystery, sometimes a surreal nightmare - and the audience are never quite sure what is real and what is not.The idea that a story, repeated often enough, gives birth to an entity like the Candyman is established very well in the original and here it takes it to its logical conclusion: Candyman is not one, but is all the injustices staining through reality and bleeding into the present.The impressive imagery of the movie ranges from bizarre body horror to beautiful shots of incredible architecture and some of the ideas for the mirror effects gave me some excellent Poltergeist 3 vibes (I *love* that movie)

750,jaz1216,Not Just a Horror Movie,8,28 September 2021,"Tl;Dr This is a smart film. If you try to come in and turn your brain off like most of these 1 star reviewers, expecting a bog standard horror movie, you probably won't enjoy it.Candyman (by Nia DaCosta) is a stunning critique of, well, critical analysis. Using the fairly well known trappings of the Candyman story, DaCosta states her premise early on that Candyman is used to cover up the real horrors going on in low income, primarily black neighborhoods. The scene in the art gallery elaborates upon this idea by examining how art that is too literal in regards to the real horrors of, say, police violence is considered lowbrow or basic. So you must dress it up in metaphor or subtext but this simply gives critics the power to tear apart your work for its construction and ignore the real problem at the center. All of this is presented through the visual metaphor of the mirror. A tired trope, but well subverted by this work.My only qualm with the film is, ironically, that it is tied so closely to the original Candyman. Or, More so how and when it chooses to dive into that lore and how it connects back to the original movie. This might just be a personal issue, but I found the revelations towards the end of the film more distracting than tension building. I was sucked away from this artfully brushed painting and back into the expositional foibles of a standard movie. But we quickly got back on track.Like I said before, it's a thoughtful movie. There are a wealth of interpretations to be had from the mirror and the film as a whole. But at its heart DaCosta wants you to take in its simplest message: Violence against African Americans is real and has a long and horrific history. Anything beyond that is there to help the message resonate.",Candyman
751,ciarathompkins,Say My Name,8,10 September 2021,"Say my nameThis is not a sequels or a remake this is an original, adding to the mythology of Candyman.The clean cinematography and the ability to turn old fixtures into new designs was very captivating.The ability of the director to tie old cast member into the new mythology with ease in story telling was groundbreaking.There was a little confusion on why this myth and Legend had such an effect on Burk, which I believe should be dived into. However there was no confusion on why Anthony had such a connection with Candyman. Go back and watch the 1992 original and you will understand this version much better.The relationship throughout movie as you dive into it showed great mental health issues and trying to fight the mental health issue while trying to adjust in belong in a industry that is not as inviting.The black and white issue are pulled more to the forefront in the story line, with the black and white puppetry story telling. Also the police brutality and the positioning of racial division with certain comments made, help bring current social issue ahead. How these issue correlate with previous mythology and making the connection with current semantics.This movie was sweet for the sweets!",Candyman
752,edrolo1975,Don't bother,1,16 September 2021,This is most possibly the worst sequel /reboot I have ever seen. It's that bad words can not describe it. Avoid.,Candyman
753,bobp262,People are really complaining about this movies politics?,10,28 August 2021,"I really don't understand what some of you were expecting. If you want to ""keep politics out of movies"" how did you wind up here in the first place? Candyman has always dealt with themes of gentrification and disenfranchised communities. Maybe learn to read between the lines going in so you don't waste other viewers time with unnecessarily low ratings.Anyways, this movie itself is excellent. It's creepy, stylish, well acted, and it does what the remakes of the 80's (The Thing, The Fly) did so well: taking the bones of the original story and housing them in a new exterior of well crafted, modern, rotting flesh. Without really spoiling anything, this movie adds a body horror element that the first one did not have, and it works very well. The actual kill scenes tend to be more stylized and subtle, but are none the less effective. I've heard complaints about the lack of gore, but I think the movie serves up a good dose of creative kill scenes without beating you over the head with it. Again, I think a lot of people tend to forget that the first Candyman was a bit more of a slow burn, and this film very much falls in line.What really makes this movie is it's layered takes on gentrification and black pain. In spite of what other reviews might have you believe, this movie is not simply saying ""white people are bad!"" Sure, it points out the ways white people exploit black pain in the modern era. It also points out the ways in which members of marginalized communities play particular roles in systems of oppression. I felt like the messages about individual aspects of gentrification were clear cut, but given that none of these roles happen in a vacuum, I thought it left an overall message that wasn't black and white. How do members of marginalized communities reconcile with taking advantage of opportunities born of pushing out their own communities? How do we all take part in using a communities suffering as a spectacle to be viewed? Both the main character and the leading woman navigate a world that wants to profit off their trauma while pretending it cares. They have the tough decisions to make of how much they're willing to actually put up for sale, and determine if they're doing a service to their community, or just to themselves.I've heard many critique the writing as being clunky, and I will say a couple aspects of the story don't come together as naturally as they could have. I wouldn't say anything feels forced, but a couple scenes felt a little shoehorned into the movie, though they tend to serve some expositional purpose at least. The details are immaculate though. Several of the lines of dialogue play off of intricacies of the sociopolitical landscape of Chicago. Interwoven with fantastic shots of Chicago architecture, and the all to real portrayal of the Chicago art scene, it speaks to a film that was written with clever intent, even if some elements came out a little half-baked.All in all, this is my favorite horror movie I've seen in a long time. Horror as a genre is not, never has, and never should be just an apolitical gore fest. From the early days of the Universal Studios monsters, horror speaks to the societal woes of the era it's created in. I believe this to be a new and vital entry into that long tradition.",Candyman

Horror is always at its best when satirical or with a deeper or hidden meaning behind it. Although in your face at the end for a moment I think this was clearly something that worked in the movie.In terms of some of the extremely bad reviews written here it does really show that white privilege and racism is very much an ongoing problem.

757,jacklunsford,Another generic horror film,5,6 September 2021,"Great use of sound mixing and audio effects, great cinematography and picture. Unfortunately the above par acting and directing is made forgettable as this is just another basic horror film that lacks originality.The only reason this movie got funding in my opinion was so it could drive the racial undertone of white people bad, black people victim. As almost every white character in the movie is brutally murdered, the only Black Death comes at the end while trying to kill one of the main characters.So if you're a black supremacists looking for some good white people slaughter, you'll love it.",Candyman
758,sadamson-03195,Rotten don't waste your time,3,17 September 2021,I was looking forward to this film so bad rubbish they just don't make films like they used too! Roll on a decent horror! 3/10.,Candyman
759,pedrompagliuso-42923,Say My Name,8,27 August 2021,"🍿 CANDYMAN (2021)INTRODUCTION - Nia Da Costa's second film, a screenplay co-writen by Da Costa and Jordan Peele, and following the reboot trend of the last few years, this is the brand new installment of the Candyman franchise, ignoring the two past sequels. After more than a year of delays, was this movie worth the wait?DIRECTING - Worth 1.0
Right off the bat, Nia does an incredible job in this movie. This movie looks gorgeous, one of the best looking horror movies in a long, long time, that's for sure. John Gulesarian's cinematography is stunning, I'm willing to go as far as to say he deserves at least a Oscar nomination. You can clearly see that Nia knows what she wants, and she gets it. I'm very excited to see what she does next, and I hope it's horror.DIRECTING gets a 1.0 out of 1.0 ⭐SCREENPLAY - Worth 1.0
I'll say that this movie is a very Jordan Peele script, you can clearly see his touch in it. And despite that being imo a mostly good thing, I have to say that he sometimes loses himself in his metaphors, and that's bad to the story. But without spoiling anything, I enjoyed how they managed to add to the Candyman figure, beign original while still following the 1992 classic.SCREENPLAY gets a 0.75 out of 1.0 ⭐CASTING - Worth 1.0
Yahya Abdul-Mateen is the perfect choice for this movie, simple as that. He gives a great performance, the supporting cast is good as well, but I didn't see a standout performance besides him.CASTING gets a 0.75 out of 1.0 ⭐SOUNDTRACK - Worth 1.0
I can't believe this is Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe's first movie score, it's incredible, and let's be honest, after Phillip Glass score in the original, he had big shoes to fill, and boy did he managed. I want to give a special appreciation to the ""The Sweet"" track. Simply great atmosphere.SOUNDTRACK gets a 1.0 out of 1.0 ⭐SPECIAL EFFECTS - Worth 0.5
Great gore. That's it. Now, about the big problem with horror movies these days: CGI... this movie doesn't have any bad CGI, or the unnecessary use of it, THANK GOD, it's barely used/visible. And when you do notice, it's with appreciation, because it's really, really good. One scene in particular at the end (you guys that watched the movie, you know what I'm talking about ;).SPECIAL EFFECTS gets a 0.5 out of 0.5 ⭐EDITING - Worth 0.5
This movie has a simple, yet effective editing, nothing much to say here. It does its job.EDITING gets a 0.25 out of 0.5 ⭐DID I ENJOY THE MOVIE? - Worth 5.0
Hell yeah, but to the big question: does it surpass the original? In my humble opinion, no. But is it good? No, it's GREAT. Great acting, great story, great score and gorgeous visuals. The movie lacks a bit in some aspects, and in one specific scenes, I had some Halloween (2018) vibes, and it wasn't a good vibe (to the ones that watched, I think you which part I'm talking), but besides that, I had an amazing time watching it. And I highly recommend you Add To Your Collection!ENJOYMENT gets a 3.75 out of 5.0 ⭐CANDYMAN (2021) gets a 8.0 out of 10 ⭐!",Candyman

762,cooperbrown-10309,Disappointing,6,17 September 2021,"As a child I watched the original film and was frighten to my core. As I got older, experiencing the sequels I have yet to have that feeling I had with the original. In saying that, I was very disappointed in this film especially with twist in Candyman's narrative and failure to build upon the character of the characters in that guy's life. The film should have been longer and should have worked a bit harder on the narrative, especially through transitions. The only good element was the physical evolution into Candyman. Meaning the bee sting, and the hand, arm, and face thing was disgusting in a good way. Anyway, I feel Jordan Peele underperformed. After he floored me with Get Out, I expected Candyman to have me pissing my pants. Us wasn't wow either. He set his own bar with Get Out. This movie really fell short. Also, I wasn't looking for propaganda. I was looking to be frighten and possibly temporarily traumatized.",Candyman
763,buzero,"Empty, bored, too many racism...",5,28 August 2021,"Great production with a lazy script, very slow pace and a very poor approach, bathed in the same story of the white man is bad ... only suitable for offended millennials.",Candyman
764,random_gyrl,Clearly none of these reviews understood the original,7,28 August 2021,"Scrolling through these reviews, I saw a couple 5 and 6 stars, but mostly 1 and 2, all complaining about the movie focusing on racism rather than horror, and blaming Jordan Peele (even though this is not his solo film). All I have to say is these people have either never seen the original Candyman or failed to understand it. If you think the original didn't have anything to do with race I think you should watch it again. Nia Dacosta did a great job with this film and tying all the legends together, creating a ""spiritual sequel"" as planned. Candyman has never been cut and dry horror, and while I agree there could have been more chilling moments, this is not as bad of a film as these other reviewers would like you to think. If you walk into a black horror film expecting jason vorhees or michael myers, that's your fault, not Dacosta's.",Candyman
765,tombslinger,A true work of art,10,7 September 2021,"For old school Candyman fans that always saw the potential for something even greater, for a mythology that means something more, this is for you. And this movie doesn't wink at the fans and drop cute little Easter eggs for us to notice - it brilliantly weaves threads from the first two movies in a relentless assault on the senses that doesn't stop escalating until the very end. I went in with high expectations, and they were exceeded. One of the few 10/10s I will give in my life, this is a modern masterpiece... a true work of art.",Candyman
766,Grayfox007,Not a Candy Man film,2,5 September 2021,"Look, I'm what some people would describe as ""woke"" but even I cringed at the racial messaging shoehorned into this film that bears little resemblance to it's origins. I went in expecting a great horror film that brings the original formula into the current day, directed by a man who is very good at his craft, sadly I left thoroughly disappointed.Just to add since it was mentioned by several other user reviews - I too witnessed people walking out during the film.",Candyman
767,laurmanolescu,politically motivated movie,1,22 October 2021,"Weak storytelling,no heart,no soul. Just another revival for some political induced reasons without asking the real issues in the black communities.an excuse to kill some white people on screen.",Candyman
768,kjjordan-18247,Pay no attention to all the butthurt bigots,8,17 September 2021,"As expected the bigots are upset, anytime a movie comes out that mentions/dissects racism in any way they get in their feelings and leave bad reviews....they did the same thing when black panther came out 😂I enjoyed it, it was a solid continuation from the original, nothing over the top so i feel like that's what made it believable.",Candyman
769,reggiesmith-88190,I love this movie,10,2 September 2021,"I love this movie, it dealt with black trauma. That many black family try to cover up for one example Brianna said throughout the movie candyman wasn't real but all the while she knew he was real because her father use to paint pictures of him which drove him to commit suicide. Many more of those traumas in the movie. I enjoyed this movie on so many different levels.",Candyman

771,jrchristensen-44025,I really wanted to like it,6,13 September 2021,"I went into this really wanting it to be great. It was visually stunning, but I was left feeling like it was trying to say and do too much. I thought the commentary on gentrification and commoditization of black pain was on point, it just felt shoehorned into the whole Candyman mythos. I get what they were trying to do here, it just didn't work for me. This is one of those movies that tried to say too much and ended up saying nothing as a result.",Candyman
772,gerry_kelly,Boring,1,6 September 2021,"A non scary horror movie, cliched casting, a lack of a story and average acting, although what else could they have done. One of the worst movies I've seen in a very long timeRidiculous and boring.",Candyman
773,wjkelle,Decent way to reincorporate real life.,8,25 September 2021,"I generally liked the film. The expanded mythology of what candy man represents is good. I do agree the pacing and horror is sadly lacking. I did enjoy or appreciate as I could tell the credits seem to show real events. I thought one of the puppet scenes at the end showed possibly Emmett Till story. But I could be wrong. It's the movie scary, no. Is it worth watching and seeing an explanation of why urban legends don't die, yes.",Candyman
774,samlittle-89220,Really bad,4,20 September 2021,Was really looking forward to this movie but clear politicism has got in the way and ruined what could've have been a great follow up to one of the all time great horror movies. Disappointed is an understatement.,Candyman
775,monkeyboy-16950,Got soo bored I almost fell asleep,2,28 August 2021,"I was excited to hear there would be a new Candyman film.However i was very disappointed with this effort.This effort was watered down and over PC'd.Created no real atmosphere, or scares.",Candyman
776,coleccathey-63660,Don't walk but run to your local theater TODAY,10,29 August 2021,"Brooooo this movie is expertly crafted. The story is somehow a rehash of the first films events as well as entirely reflecting current moods, trends, and concepts. It felt a bit short, but perhaps this was intentional as it left us in the audience yearning for more. There were not a lot of people in my theater (Pandemic right?), but those that were there allowed for a brief clap at the end of the film. FYI: No post credits scenes. This film as a whole was a properly paced, descent into madness that accomplishes one thing for the franchise which is ""World Building"". The Candyman universe is pretty set from here as to a myriad of directions it can be taken by artists, writers & directors alike. The first film is kind of required viewing to fully grasp the events of the new film. But it is a worthy, wonderful, accomplished addition that only makes the Candyman concept that much more rich, complex, and sweet as candy.",Candyman
777,neriahofer,Total garbage,2,28 September 2021,"Unlike the original film which was ok, this reboot is not by any standard a horror movie.Political and social adgenda film.Dont waste your time.",Candyman

779,mrpcwells,Good stuff,8,17 October 2021,"The original Candyman was was more than a straightforward slasher. It had an unusually philosophical 'hook', so to speak.Any reboot would have to attempt something similar and, for the most part, I think this film succeeds.It's not perfect though. In particular, the central character's story arc races to a punchline with far too much haste. But it's well made, well acted, the effects are stunning (whereas the original's have dated badly) and looks fantastic. Definitely worth a watch.",Candyman
780,andrzejdavis,Perfect Recreation,9,26 September 2021,"This movie was exactly what I needed to satisfy my candyman itch after watching the 1992 one (one of my favorite horror movies.) It had all the perfect elements of the last one while introducing some new fantastic ideas. I was scared, and excited throughout. Although it wasn't the best movie, and at points the overall message of the damage of police brutality felt forced to the audience rather than put there for us to discover, I personally loved this movie.",Candyman
781,godofwar-99486,Say Their Names,10,26 September 2021,"Did you know the first Candyman (1992) movie cut out a scene where Helen Lyle declared her love for the Candyman because the studio was worried about the backlash over showing an ""interracial couple""? Well, I can assure you that Candyman (2021) does not give a second thought to offending racists this time around.The message of this movie is a very clear and important one. The treatment of black people in America is what the director wanted to convey. Whether it's the 2020's, the 2010's, the 2000's, the 90's, or the 1800's, the message has always been the same one. It's just that now, people are able to finally spread that message without fear of those who are the reason for the suffering of black people in America.Saying that a movie is ""too political"" because you didn't like the message isn't a reason to give it a low rating. Because the experience of others makes you uncomfortable, isn't a reason to give the movie a low rating. You can try to silence the voices of those who speak out just as many others like you have tried in the past, but the fact that a movie with a message like this can even be made speaks volumes to the fact that your tired old methods are no longer working.",Candyman
