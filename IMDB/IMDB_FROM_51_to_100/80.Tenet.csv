0,Leofwine_draca,Not as good as it thinks it is,7,9 October 2021,"Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come.",Tenet
1,SnoopyStyle,relentless filmmaking,7,1 December 2020,"The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a CIA operative. He is captured during an operation in Ukraine. He is able to eat a cyanide pill. He wakes up and gets recruited to fight a new cold war. Someone in the future is using inverted entropy to affect events in the past. He and Neil (Robert Pattinson) start investigating zeroing in on former Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and his abused wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).Christopher Nolan obviously has a thing about time. Memento happens to be one of my favorite films of all time. He is attacking it with all of his filmmaking skills and it is an attack from the editing, the sound mix, the plot, to the structure of the movie. First thing I noticed is that Nolan is relentlessly pushing the pace with every bit of filmmaking. The sound mix is like a heartbeat driving the movie whenever it goes into action mode. The editing is crisp and head-snapping. This is his transport plane deliberately driven into a constructed fake building. He's driving the movie into a fake building and not letting the audience the time to ruminate about the logic of the premise.In the end, that's its biggest flaw. The premise is out there and it's hard to keep track of the plot after the turn. The first part is a movie of one thing after another. When it gets to Kat, it finally tries to establish a connection with the characters. The fun part is the backward action moves but the logic of this premise keeps bugging me. For example, why is he trying to shoot himself in the past? Thinking about it after the fact leaves one with more questions and questions about the questions. The good part is that the relentless great action makes it impossible to dislike. The backwards action is just fun and different. That's plenty good enough.",Tenet
2,Horst_In_Translation,"I did not like it a lot, Nolan seems to be on a downward spiral for me now",4,5 October 2020,"""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind.Then again, Nolan's films are almost always more about the magic of the story and the scientific aspect partially even, the other production values too, and not necessarily about really deep and meaningful characters. It is the case here again. Robert Pattinson is another good example. I definitely think he received a lot of unfair criticism for Twilight and he has been (unlike Lautner) in several good films in the last decade since these vampire films and given strong performances too. He is definitely an option for an Oscar nomination in the near future. But for this film here he felt almost completely wasted. I mean he had a lot of screen time, but barely any significance. The one who stood out a bit in terms of performances here was Kenneth Branagh showing us that he can play a Russian brute very well too. Talented actor and filmmaker without a doubt and his rough take on the role made his relationship with Debicki's character the most interesting component of the entire film perhaps. Debicki did what she had to do I would say, but she never really stood out either. Oh yes, Nolan regular Michael Caine, who is closing in on 90, gets his one scene as well again basically talking to the protagonist relatively early on just like it was the case with ""Inception"" too for him. No material to shine at all though. That's pretty much it with the cast. More familiar faces and names too for sure, but nobody really outstanding.As for the story, you are thrown right in the middle of it all with the concert hall scene. It is tense and brutal, but for me it was too fast and I would have preferred a little more introduction and explanation here. Let's be honest. If you did not know who the protagonist was, simply because JDW is kinda famous (like him or not), it would have felt even more pointless. The idea of the suicide pill being just a test is an interesting one though and also kinda makes sense that it was all staged because, let's be honest, the ""bad guys"" must be utter fools to let such a severely suffering prisoner give his pill to another one caught by them. Still, this was to me the first moment and inclusion that felt good. A lot of the story about travelling back in time, like literally physically back in time felt not depicted in a way where it convinced me. If we are gentle, we could say that Nolan's mind is still too great to make sense to general audiences, but if not, we could also say that his idea here was not good and interesting enough and more for the sake of being genius than actually being genius and that also a lot got lost in translation. I did like the really simple introduction scene to the concept though at the shooting range between the scientist and the protagonist. This was nice. But when they extended this concept to humans and a plot that is about saving the world, then it did not win me over unfortunately. Oh well, like I said, maybe I need to watch it again.Also the final moment between Washington's and Pattinson's characters where we find out they knew each other for a lot longer did not make much of an impact to me. At least not as much as I hoped because this beautiful friendship was supposed to be shown as one of the more emotional twists this film has to offer. I would say that judging from the absense of audible reactions from the crowd during my showing that most others were not really that impressed either. Or maybe I am being too harsh here and really need to rewatch to see if the one reviewer on the front page here is correct by saying that it feels like nothing special on the first viewing, but pretty great on rewatch. Still not motivated though and besides, I rarely tend to appreciate a movie more on television or a small screen than at a movie theater and I will definitely not go again as long as it is shown right now. The only reason that could kinda get me to would be Branagh's performance. Here Nolan proves again for me that he may not really be the best when it comes to truly emotional aspects away from action sequences. I am mostly talking about the talk referring to the female protagonist's son. Like when we hear from one character the world will be destroyed and then Debicki's character says something like that would mean her son dies too. A bit on the cringe side.I am kinda glad they did not elaborate more on a potential romance relationship between her and JDW's character because then things could have gotten really messy. The one scene with the talk about Branagh's antagonist character thinking they could have sex was enough already. Speaking of him, he also talks on one occasion about holes in the neck and what to fill them with. Okay, that was rough. And almost a bit of cult like from a Tarantino movie (where we indirectly could have seen it depicted on the screen even). I won't deny it. Rough, but entertaining. What you think about the terminal disease plot that got revealed later on and as a consequence about Branagh's character developing some kind of god complex is up to you. I thought it was right, but like I said, I believed almost everything about Branagh's character and performance here. It's okay if you think it was too much. The one thing I would not be okay with though is really people saying that this was a magnificent movie or (one of) Nolan's best. I thought it was too much on the underwhelming side for a positive recommendation even and I genuinely hope that the filmmaker can improve again with his upcoming projects. I mean he may have another 30 years in the industry and I refuse to believe that ""Tenet"" (spelled Tenet backwards too, definitely not a coincidence) and ""Dunkirk"" will be on the same level as everything he has coming up in the future or at least I don't want to believe. No need to challenge your audience this much, Chris, sometimes less is more. How about an animated movie for once?",Tenet
3,Prismark10,Tenet,6,28 September 2020,"There are elements of Christopher Nolan's Tenet that has been inspired by other sources. 12 Monkeys, La Jetée, The Red Dwarf episode called Backwards, Steven Moffat's Doctor Who stories featuring River Song.Stripped of its gimmick of inverted time. It is basically John Le Carre's The Night Manager. Elizabeth Debicki appeared in the television adaptation and basically plays a similar character in Tenet.The Protagonist (John David Washington) teams up with sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson) to stop Russian oligarch Sator (Kenneth Branagh) who has found a way to send a destructive weapon back from the future.In this temporal war, the Protagonist needs to get to Sator via his estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki.)The inverted backward effects are eye dazzlingly conveyed. Nolan once again goes for an expensive high concept James Bond type set pieces.However the various going ons in the story is confusing. Not helped by terms such as Time Inversion, Temporal Pincer movement. I found the trick is to follow the forward narrative of Neil and not be confused by the The Protagonist's stories.Tenet is an enjoyable funfair ride. However I also felt that it was something you would quickly forget as you do not want to spend a lot of time thinking about it. I have no doubts that I would watch it again at a later date.Due to Covid 19, the cinema I saw it at was almost empty and I watched it on a weekend. That did somewhat rob the atmosphere.",Tenet
4,nogodnomasters,"You don't work for us, you're dead.",5,11 September 2020,"The film opens with music critics gone bad.May contain plot spoilers as I understand the plot. John David Washington is recruited to save the world from Andrei (Kenneth Branagh ) a Russian oligarch. A secret city in Russia was destroyed and has bomb grade 241 laying about in standardized containers. However, the plot isn't that simple. There is a time travel thing going on. Things move backwards and forwards in time. Both have to happen as not to disturb the entropy. If the algorithm is altered, everything ends. The guy who wants to start WWIII in involved with the time travel.Things were confusing to say the least with too much of the film running backwards to prevent a paradox. Needed to be shorter.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Tenet
5,kosmasp,At-Tenet-ion: Can you feel it?,10,30 August 2020,"Now this movie really begs of you to listen, to watch and to be there for the whole thing. You can get not just the just of it in one viewing, but you can understand it - although as the movie itself tells the protagonist, sometimes it is ok to just ""feel it"". And that is something you most certainly can do. Anyone can do that.One thing I would recommend (if you like the genre that is of course, because if you're not open to this mind bender, than you're wasting your time anyway), is to watch this on the biggest screen possible. The best way to watch this is apparently the BFI in London (IMAX). That is of August 2020 speaking, there are cinemas being build even during the pandemic, one in the south of Germany, which has as a goal to be the biggest screen worldwide. Now just check where an Imax is and if you can attend to a screening there. Otherwise just choose another screen, but try to watch it in cinemas. Hopefully you're not too afraid because of Corona and your cinemas are still open and do everything they can to be safe.Talking about safe. That is one of the goals of our main protagonist. Even if he doesn't know it yet - or maybe he does? Is it complex? For sure and that's a good thing. While driving to the cinema (Imax) we watched this at (with a couple of friends), we got into traffic and were a bit late. So we did miss the first couple of minutes and were told of them. Not just because of that I will watch it again. And yet I still got it. I would even say that if you've seen the odd movie here and there, you will be able to know certain things (""twists"" or revelations).I can not stress out enough how visually amazing this is, but we knew that of Christopher Nolan. The sound design is amazing too, soundtrack heightens everything - and the acting is top notch. Now one of the points I felt was not done very well, was the ""sailing"" scene. You almost couldn't understand them at all. Most of the other stuff wasn't that bad. But again and as said before twice: you've got to feel it - so do you feel it?",Tenet
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"Excellent, even if I didn't fully get it.",8,12 September 2020,"This is the first film in a while where I'm going to watch it a second time, partly because I enjoyed it first time round, but primarily because I wanted to understand it better.It's a very, very good film, I enjoy complex, Tenet takes complex to a whole new level. Great if you have the ability to concentrate, frustrating I would imagine for a casual viewer, I heard several people moaning they hadn't a clue what they'd just watched.I found it rather exciting, and very entertaining, I'm not sure if it was the cinema I was in, but the sound wasn't exactly perfect, the music seemed to overpower the dialogue.Robert Pattinson, my heart sank when I heard he was going to play Batman, however, after watching this, I'm now convinced he'll do a great job, he was terrific in this.Don't be surprised if you want a second viewing for clarity, well worth it, excellent movie. 8/10.",Tenet
7,classicsoncall,"""We are being attacked by the future.""",8,3 May 2021,"Christopher Nolan seems to have this penchant for making challenging cerebral movies that force you to pay attention. This one borrows elements from at least thee of his prior films that come to mind - 2000's ""Memento"", with it's perpetual rewind button; 2010's ""Inception"" that focuses on an alternate reality; and 2014's ""Interstellar"" with it's time travel anomaly. I generally rate his films highly here on IMDb even if I don't quite get what he's trying to accomplish, primarily for the stunning visuals and the clever creativity. With ""Tenet"", we have a protagonist who quite coincidentally goes by the description 'Protagonist' (John David Washington), who's recruited for a 'save the world' mission that requires stopping a single individual who's death would bring about the end of the planet. That facet of the picture isn't really explained very well, unless you want to give some credibility to the idea of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission, in which case it might make perfect sense.At least Nolan created a cinematic universe in which he brings back the idea that one shouldn't come across one's self in the past or the future, a concept that was stood on it's head in ""Back to the Future"". When I was a kid watching sci-fi flicks and TV shows, running into yourself in another reality was a recipe for disaster that was pretty much cast in concrete. Maybe some day the concept might get tested for real, but that's probably a long way off. In the meantime, just go through your old photo albums.The coolest thing about this picture were the handful of scenes where the time loop ran backwards and you encountered the forward moving protagonists running counter to just about everything else around them. Notwithstanding the 'grandfather paradox', one thing that the film makers could have done would have been to utilize a bitemporal response effect to construct additional sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter, thereby locking in the space/time anomaly in a temporal pincer movement. Then, by inverting an object's entropy, you could have had a multi-dimensional acceleration of events resulting in a future unhampered by the past. Feel free to pass the idea along to Mr. Nolan.",Tenet
8,lee_eisenberg,time-tested,7,9 May 2021,"To the pantheon of movies playing with the notion of time we can now add Christopher Nolan's Academy Award-winning ""Tenet"". The plot is a little hard to explain due to the complexity, so I'll say that the cast does a fine job with their roles, and I liked seeing the various places where they filmed (particularly Tallinn).Improbable though the concept may be, it does address the issue of cause and effect (what we do now will affect things in the future). Not a full-scale masterpiece, but still worth seeing.",Tenet
9,jboothmillard,Tenet,4,30 August 2020,"This film was originally intended to be released in mid-July 2020, but was delayed to 31 July, until finally being released in August, this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing all cinemas to close during the lockdown. I saw the five minute footage trailer back in March, and I was most interested to see it on the big screen, so thank goodness cinemas eventually reopened (with guidelines and safety measures), and I went to see this. The dictionary definition of ""tenet"" is ""any opinion, principle, doctrine, dogma, etc., especially one held as true by members of a profession, group, or movement"", I just knew it was a blockbuster that loads of people, including me, were keen to see, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception, Dunkirk). Basically, an unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington, Denzel's son), a CIA agent posing as a Ukrainian policeman, participates in an undercover Russian operation to steal an unidentified object during a terrorist siege on an opera house in Kyiv. During the chaos, the Protagonist is saved by a masked gunman using time-reversing technology. The Russians turn on the CIA members and torture the Protagonist, but he bites a suicide pill before to avoid revealing any information. The Protagonist wakes, learning that the pill was fake, and that all his team members were caught and killed by the Russians, and they have got the unidentified object. The Protagonist is recruited into a secret organisation seeking to track down the origin of ""inverted"" objects, which move backward through time, using future technology sent back into the past. Investigating inverted bullets, the Protagonist is assisted by Neil (Robert Pattinson) to infiltrate the compound of an arms dealer, Priya (Dimple Kapadia). She directs them towards Russian oligarch Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). To reach Sator, the Protagonist approaches Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). The Protagonist experiences the inverted technology during an operation, involving a plane crashed the storage facility in Oslo Airport, where he fights a regular masked man. Neil unmasks and releases his opponent, then stops the Protagonist from killing the inverted opponent, who escapes. Priya explains that the facility contained a time inversion device. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to meet Sator, who the Protagonist saves Sator from Kat's murder attempt. Sator reveals that information sent from the future had contributed to his wealth. The Protagonist offers to steal the object that Sator had been seeking, in exchange that Kat will be freed. After the Protagonist and Neil steal the object from an armoured car in transport, an inverted Sator confronts them, holding Kat hostage to obtain the object. Neil calls in the secret organisation's time-inverting troops to assist. Time inversion devices are used by Sator and the Protagonist and they battle for possession of the object, with Sator ultimately prevailing; and Kat is severely wounded with an inverted bullet. To save Kat from death, the Protagonist and Neil join her in inverted time, but they require the device in Oslo Airport to un-invert in the past. They infiltrate the airport, using the plane crash as a distraction: the masked man the Protagonist previously encountered was actually his future self. The un-inversion is successful. Priya explains that the crucial object is part of a future-developed ""algorithm"" capable of catastrophically inverting the entire world. The algorithm was sent into the past to prevent its use in the future, leading to human extinction from climate change. Kat reveals Sator's motive: he is dying from inoperable cancer and believes that the world should die with him. Sator has the algorithm and travels to a time in the past when he was most happy, where he plans to die peacefully and activate the algorithm. He is followed by Kat and the time-inverting secret organisation. Kat will delay Sator's death in Vietnam, while troops attack a Soviet closed city to retrieve the algorithm. Kat kills Sator prematurely, but the Protagonist and Neil retrieve the algorithm in time. During the retrieval, the Protagonist is saved by a masked corpse who springs back to life inverted. The organisation plans to separately hide the algorithm's components. As Neil and the Protagonist part ways, Neil reminisces about their long partnership, revealing that the future version of the Protagonist had recruited Neil in Neil's past. The Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his backpack, like that who saved him in the opera house. Neil insists he must continue his mission, intending to invert time. In London, Priya attempts to kill Kat to tie up loose ends. Instead, the Protagonist kills Priya, and implies that a future version of himself will be the mastermind behind all of the secret organisation's actions. Also starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ives, Himesh Patel as Mahir, Michael Caine as Michael Crosby, and Fiona Dourif (Brad's daughter) as Wheeler. Washington is reasonable as the lead, Pattinson is fine, Branagh is suitably hammy as the villain, and there is almost point in Caine being in the film, being in a single and very short scene. A character asks, ""Does your head hurt yet?"" to another, that is exactly the feeling you are going have watching this film. You cannot deny that the special effects, editing, and sound design are fantastic to make spectacular scenes with explosions, gunfire and crashes seen reversing and going forward, sometimes in the same scene. The problem is, it is pretty much impossible to try and work out what the hell is going on, it is trying to be too clever that it almost forgets about the audience watching. It's not quite what I had in mind as the first film to watch returning to the cinema, lol. I really wanted to follow and understand it, but it is just too confusing, I admit that I fell asleep at one point, a visually fantastic but mind-boggling science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Ludwig Göransson. Okay, in my opinion!",Tenet
10,Tweekums,Time travels in both directions in this Christopher Nolan thriller,9,31 December 2020,"This thriller is centred on an unnamed protagonist. All we know is that he is a CIA operative who shortly after the opening is recruited into an even more secretive organisation; 'Tenet'. One that is determined to save the world from an unexpected enemy... our future selves! So-called inverted items have been found which travel through time in the opposite direction and Tenet wants to discover who supplied these items. The trail leads to an Indian arms dealer then onto a Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator. It appears he has the technology to invert items and is using the technology to find something which if used could end the world as we know it.I really enjoyed this sci-fi thriller; I think I managed to follow what was going on but will have to watch again to be sure... with characters travelling in both directions though time it can be a little confusing at times. Events we see through the perspective of a character travelling normally through time seem slightly different when seen from the perspective of somebody travelling in the opposite direction later in the film. The action is impressive; with chases, shooting and explosions in a variety of locations it feels like a sci-fi version of a James Bond film. The cast is impressive with John David Washington impressing as our protagonist, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki being very good as the protagonist's handler and Sator's wife respectively. Kenneth Branagh is suitably menacing as Sator. There is some violence but no more than one would expect from the likes of Bond so the film only has a UK-12 rating; it might be a little confusing for younger viewers though. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for fans is smart sci-fi and thrillers.",Tenet

12,CinemaSerf,James Bond lite...,6,9 September 2020,"I have seen this film twice now - once on an IMAX and once on a smaller screen to try and get the most from it - and I have to admit it's just nothing special. John David Washington - manscaped to within an inch of his life - is the ""Protagonist"" - a man who can manipulate time and who is recruited to work with ""Neil"" (Robert Pattinson) to track down a device that could destroy the world. His task is made much the harder because the future seems to be the source of much of the danger as he tries to track down and thwart Russian oligarch ""Andrei Sator"" (Sir Kenneth Branagh). Aside from plenty of action and some really clever special effects, that's about the height of it. JDW is adequate in the lead, but Pattinson is about as convincing as a rubber spider and Sir Kenneth's accent is so thick as to remind me of Cate Blanchett's dodgy wubble-ewes from ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). The star, for me at any rate, is Elizabeth Debicki as the trophy-wife who has an agenda of her own to escape the clutches of her megalomaniac husband, with her son - and so becomes an obvious ally on their quest. The plot is oddly straightforward, it's pretty obvious from the outset whom he can/cannot trust and once the faux-complexities of the story have been laid bare, the rest of the film is just a pretty routine spy drama that looks great - car chases, glamorous scenery etc - but is surely just a superb acclamation of hype over content. Certainly worth watching - and I'd say more than once, but it is by no means the best work from this visionary director .",Tenet
13,grantss,James Bond with time travel,6,29 August 2020,"A CIA agent is given an unusual assignment: track down the source of inverted bullets, bullets that move backwards through time. This will hopefully lead him to the source of entropy-reversal technology from the future.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors, with Memento ranking, for me, as the second greatest movie of all time. Being written and directed by him you know it is going to be clever and complex.Here, however, he lays on the complexity but fails to make it entirely understandable. Twists and cleverness just for twists and cleverness sake. Throw in the fact that the dialogue often gets drowned out by the loud, droning, this-is-a-key-moment-so-needs-loud-music score (a trick Nolan picked up in Dunkirk, where we had that irritating droning sound throughout the movie) and the plot is difficult to follow. At a point I gave up trying to understand the concepts behind the plot, or follow the plot itself, and just went along for the ride.In addition to being not entirely comprehensible, the film is more an action movie than an intelligent thriller. It has many traits of a Bond film: jet-setting locations, find A to get to B to get to C with the slimmest links between the different parts in the chain. This all an excuse for some outlandish scheme or action sequence. Plus the villain has the opportunity to quickly kill the hero several times but chooses not too - very Bond-like. Add in the perfectly-choreographed action sequences, many big, bright explosions and it's more style than substance.This said, it is reasonably enjoyable. The action sequences are well done, it moves at a great pace and doesn't feel like a 2.5-hour movie.Performances are pretty solid, especially from John David Washington (in the lead role) and Elizabeth Debicki. Kenneth Branagh does his best fake Russian accent and seems every inch the Bond villain. I have never liked Robert Pattinson, thanks to that Twilight crap, but was hoping here he could prove he had some decent dramatic acting skills. Sadly, no, he doesn't.More style than substance, and below Christopher Nolan's usual standard, but reasonably entertaining.",Tenet
14,Calicodreamin,"My brain hurts, but in a good way",8,2 September 2020,"There's so much to digest with this movie. Time moving forwards and backwards at the same time is mind blowing.

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"How does he keep outdoing himself, and raising the bar for all future filmmakers?",10,28 August 2020,"The protagonist(John David Washington, a great lead) is recruited to stop a major threat. I won't reveal more detail than that. Thankfully, he won't have to face it alone. He'll be working with Neil(Robert Pattinson, all charm and wit). Hypothetically, if he had other allies, I would not give away here who they are. I won't reveal the exact nature of the role of Kat(Elizabeth Debicki, somehow matching her work in Widows. Covering a lot of the emotional spectrum). But I will say that, if I didn't love everything about this(don't get me wrong, I absolutely do), honestly, even if, in fact, I *hated* every single other thing about this movie, it would still be worth watching for her performance and presence alone. They are up against a formidable threat: Sator(Kenneth Branagh, very sinister). Can they possibly save the world?The director continues to master spy movies. In some ways this is James Bond with a mindbending sci-fi twist. Nolan has returned to the heights of quality of The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Inception. It has the best and biggest action set pieces of his career, and it's the most visually compelling. Even for him, this is incredibly complex. It won't be enough to pay close attention and try carefully to figure everything out while watching. You'll have to go over everything afterwards. It may take multiple viewings. I won't claim I understand everything in this yet.This pushes the PG-13 rating, and contains a lot of exploration of abuse, some deeply disturbing violence(even though it is more hinted at than clearly shown), and a little bit of strong language. I recommend this to every fan of anyone working on this, with the obvious caveat that I would not want for anyone who fears for their safety in a theatre due to Covid to risk harm to themselves or those around them. 10/10",Tenet
16,view_and_review,Big Brain Time,8,24 December 2020,"I had to watch this movie twice to even partially digest it. The last time I had to do that was for a movie called ""Primer"" which was a super complex temporal movie. Whenever you get deep into time travel and temporal loops you open up a can of WTF that can't be closed again.I'm not going to delve deeply into the plot of ""Tenet"" because I'll only confuse you and myself. Suffice it to say that Protagonist (John David Washington) was on a mission. The mission had to do with a doomsday device that involved time collapsing on itself (kind of). In this future there were items that could be inverted; meaning that their movements were backwards (bullets going back into guns). Their ""entropy"" was reversed. There are also ""turnstiles"" that people can go through and ""invert"" themselves. And that's when it gets really head-scratching.Protagonist is helped along the way by Neil (Robert Pattinson) and reluctantly by Katherine ""Kat"" Barton (Elizabeth Debicki). They help Protagonist get close to Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), our antagonist who happens to know very well how to use the turnstiles for his benefit.""Tenet"" was a combination of ""Looper,"" ""The Edge of Tomorrow,"" and many other temporal loop movies with a splash of ""Inception"" level brain melting. I have to say that even though I was struggling to process it all while watching I was still very much into it. If you're going to go over peoples' heads, at least do it extravagantly, and that's what Christopher Nolan did. The movie was good enough with my tenuous grasp that it warranted me watching a second time (I did buy it after all).John David Washington isn't terribly convincing as an action hero or a suave spy. His father did a better job at an advanced age in the movie ""The Equalizer."" The fight sequences were a little lacking as was his acting. Pattinson, on the other hand, was a bit more convincing.The dialog of the movie from all parties was a little confusing. The accents presented some problems with understanding, but more than that it seemed that the script was intentionally vague even when it didn't need to be. I get that the entire concept is bananas and creates a paradox like you wouldn't believe, but there are times when more words could've helped while not frying our brains.In the end I liked it. It made me think, it made me pay attention, shoot, it made me take notes. I only regret that COVID prevented me from seeing this in the theater.",Tenet
17,neil-476,Far too clever for its own good,5,31 August 2020,"Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...Christopher Nolan's latest follows Inception and interstellar and, if you thought they were difficult to understand and follow, you ain't seen nothin' yet.Inversion is a great maguffin. The problem here is that in order to follow the story, you need to have an understanding of how inversion works, and that's exactly what you don't get here. In fact a lady scientist early on says ""Don't try to understand it, just accept it,"" and this is effectively writer/director talking to the viewer. I think this is code for him saying ""I haven't really thought this through completely, so don't expect it to make sense."" Given that it has taken him years to write this...There are various problems. Given that you have time running backwards and forwards at the same time, it's fair to generate an element of ""What's going on?"" to be answered when a reverse-time sequence unfolds in positive time back to its start at the end. But what I just said gives some indication of how preplexing the film is when much of it is told that way. A number of IMDB reviews say it was gibberish on first viewing, made sense on second viewing. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to see a film twice for it to make sense, especially if it takes a frustrating two and a half hours to watch it once.The next problem is that dialogue is mumbled and buried under general noise, making it nearly impossible to hear very necessary exposition.I'm not going to go on about this film which would have been a great deal better if it had been a great deal simpler, and which would have benefitted from Nolan having a co-writer on board to act as the viewer's friend. This film is NOT the greatest thing since sliced bread. I give it 5 out of 10, which is what happens when a 10/10 positive entropy maguffin meets an inversed 0/10 script.",Tenet

Feel it.""",9,5 September 2020,"Seeing Tenet finally being released in the UK,I looked up details of it being shown in IMAX, (well aware of the film makers love for the format) and was thrilled to find that half the movie was in that format. A fan of the director, I booked a ticket at the Manchester IMAX Vue in The Printworks, (the second biggest screen in Europe) and got set to turn back time.View on the film:Later revealing that he based his take on the character on author Christopher Hitchens, (most noticeable in his mannerism and accent)Robert Pattinson gives a exuberant performance as Neil, whose fight to straighten time out is charged by a slippery confidence of Neil not revealing all his cards to the audience.Picking up the mission file from Sir Michael, John David Washington gives a brooding turn as ""The Protagonist"", giving the action scenes a real grit by fighting tooth and nail,along with a intense urgency to turn the clocks.Igniting his experimentation of compressed sound with gunfire landing to Ludwig Goransson's thrashing score, and not containing any green screen shots, writer/directing auteur Christopher Nolan reunites with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, and continues to explore the manipulation of time in film he first clicked in Memento (2000) in a spectacular fashion.Nolan and Hoytema turn the clocks with mesmerising in-camera tricks panning the camera over alterations in time,rising to long crane shots gliding across vast action set-pieces running under a powder keg

19,deloudelouvain,This is by far the most complex story that is enjoyable to watch.,7,4 December 2020,"First of all, did I enjoy this movie from Christopher Nolan? Was I entertained for the entire duration which was quite long? On both questions I have to answer yes. Now I don't concider myself as dumb, but I'm not a genius either, but this movie is so hard to follow, almost at the point you pain your brain trying to figure out what's going on. I'm happy I'm not the only one that didn't understand much of the complexity of the story. Like some other reviewers stated it's probably better to watch it a second time to fully, or at least partially understand, but I'm not going to do that. Tenet is just one of those movies that need your full constant attention, very difficult to understand but that isn't bad for the matter. The cinematography is great, with excellent action scenes, and a cast that did a very good job. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the two main characters are pleasant to watch. In conclusion, I'm surprised I liked this movie as I didn't get it all, but I'm not sure it will please everybody, certainly not the picky viewers.",Tenet
20,siderite,Temporal James Bond,8,29 November 2020,"It's like Nolan is upset that some people understood what he was trying to do, so he makes things more and more complex until he is sure no one does understand. This film is about a very skilled and motivated special agent - think James Bond on steroids - who gets recruited to fight in a temporal war. The technology has been created to reverse the flow of entropy, which means objects and people can be made to travel backwards in time, and by that I mean literally just do things in reverse, not teleport in time, while the rest of the world goes in the normal direction. It's an intriguing concept that generates a storyline so complex that it can't be understood from just a viewing.So the question is: is this movie good enough to warrant multiple viewings, so that people can grasp the intricacies of time travel and of Nolan's twisted mind? And for me the answer is no. I have no idea where are the logic holes in the plot and frankly I don't care, and that for a very simple reason: I couldn't relate to any character, except perhaps Robert Pattinson's. The special agent that fights for the world, who has no history or personal life, a ""protagonist"" bought wholesale from a shelf, is boring as a person and as a character. The amazingly beautiful woman who is the object of interest for both hero and villain, for no good reason other than she's hot, whose motivation is solely related to her son and her own selfish emotions, to the point where she risks the existence of the world on ""not letting him feel he won"", is almost as disgusting if not more as the villain. Everyone else is just a pawn, acting as such, with a few scenes each in Nolan's extensive plot.Another issue with the film is the pace. Having worked so much on the plot, I guess it was a chore to compress it all to the size of a film. And even so it was two ours and a half long. This would have been much better served by a miniseries. As such, it felt rushed with details that you had to think through while other fast paced scenes were flooding in.It was a very carefully crafted film, which makes it well above average, but it failed at the basics: characterization and pace. Perhaps I will think about it some more and manage to enjoy the genius in it, but after just having watched it, I just feel tired and glad it's over.",Tenet
21,ksf-2,interesting premise.,7,7 July 2021,"The only names i recognize are David Washington (Protagonist), Robert Pattinson (Neil), and Michael Caine (Crosby), who's in just everything. It's a spy thrillah, where the protagonist must check out weapons that are coming from the future. Not an easy task. And since some of the weapons work in reverse time, it makes things extra difficult. He meets some people in high places, but has no idea who he can trust. It's written and directed by Chris Nolan, so it's a huge, long, complicated epic, that travels all over the world, like a bond film. Check out the list of filming locations on imdb; very exotic. It's pretty good. Every few minutes, the bad guy threatens to kill his wife... that got old fast. The music was hit or miss... sometimes it was just right, and sometimes it was odd and off the mark. With some parts of the film going in reverse, it gets quite confusing, so i'll probably want to watch it again. There are some fun twists and turns. It would help to know (many) laws of physics. I should have taken more physics in university.",Tenet

23,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A typical modern Nolan film so you must take it for what it is,9,4 January 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAn unnamed protagonist (John David Washington) joins forces with arms dealer Priya (Dimple Kapadia) to retrieve a compromising painting of Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), the wife of ruthless arms dealer Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) by creating a massive explosion at an airport. However, they are unexpectedly accosted at the scene by unidentified men, whose allegiance is unclear. The Protagonist then becomes embroiled in a desperate battle to stop Sator detonating a plutonium bomb in a final act of defiance.After the tight, claustrophobic (and, crucially, short) real time war thriller Dunkirk, it seemed like Christopher Nolan had returned to the vaguely relatable filmic style he began with, in contrast to the cerebral onslaughts he's become known for in more recent times, it's this formula he returns to wholesale with Tenet, his latest filmic epic becoming one of the few big features to go to theatres during the pandemic. I knew what to expect before I started watching, and so had no choice but to sit back and pay attention.Relative unknown Washington is in the lead role, and makes a calm, assured job carrying the project, creating a convincing secret agent (or 'protagonist', as we know him) with support from the likes of Robert Pattinson as his dubious counterpart, whilst Branagh has a scary intensity as the villain, doing a fine Russian accent, as well, of course, as the obligatory Michael Caine cameo. The considerable length is quelled by some ravishing action set pieces, lavishly played out on screen.You will, of course, have to pay attention and use your brain, but you, like me, should have become accustomed to the filmic style Nolan seems to have adopted as his trademark by now, and, while I'm not sure I completely nailed the plot, at least this time I had a bit more fun trying to make sense of it. ****",Tenet
24,MOscarbradley,Sci-Fi silliness that's also hugely enjoyable.,8,28 August 2020,"There's been a great deal of talk about the impenetrability of the plot of Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster ""Tenet"" when, in fact, the plot isn't so much inpenetrable, (the 'plot' itself, for want of a better word, is actually quite simple and is spelled out in the first fifteen minutes or so), as sci-fi silly. This is another time travel picture but instead of time travel it's called 'inversion' which is really time travel by the back door so that about midway through the forward thrust of the plot takes a back seat and we start going back in time or maybe 'back to the future'; at least I think that was what was happening. To be honest, by now I didn't really care. I had long stopped trying to 'follow' the movie and was now just sitting back and enjoying every daft minute of it.Of course, it's not the first time Nolan has mucked about with 'inversion' or just played havoc with our perceptions of reality. ""Momento"" told its story backwards while I'm still puzzling over ""Inception"". This, you may argue, is cleverness for its own sake but I'm sure Nolan doesn't expect anyone to take a calculus or a set of algorithms into the cinema. He knows this is nonsense and he's just messing with us and messing with us on a supersonic level. First and last ""Tenet"", (oh, and the title's a palindrome, geddit?), is just a big, dumb-but-prentending-to-be-clever action flic with some of the most terrific set-pieces in years, (an 'inverted' car chase sets a new high). It's also got a deliberately cheesy script and some bravura tonge-in-cheek performances.If John David Washington is a little too insouciant as the hero, (or the protagonist as he keeps referring to himself), he's ably backed up by a superb Robert Pattinson as his sidekick, a terrific Kenneth Branagh relishing his role as the villain to end all villains, (please cast him in the next Bond movie), and a spunky Elizabeth Debicki as a time-travelling wife, mother and potential love interest. You don't expect performances of this quality in nonsense of this kind so let's just say they are a bonus. The final bonkers, saving the world from total destruction climax is over-extended and the movie tidies itself up a little too smugly but I'll forgive these minor blemishes when everything else is so much fun.",Tenet
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Let's do the time warp again.,7,31 December 2020,"First of all, the sound mixing in 'Tenet (2020)' is all out of whack. The music is simply too loud and you often can't hear integral lines of dialogue because of it. I understand that it's trying to be 'cinematic', but making sure your audience is actually being able to hear the dialogue is pretty much rule number one. This isn't its only issue, but it's probably the one that's the least excusable. Still, it's not like the entire thing is unwatchable. It's more of a headache-inducing annoyance than an experience-halting hindrance. The movie, in general, is a bit of a mixed bag. When it comes down to it, it's an interesting and typically entertaining affair. You can just about follow and enjoy it, provided you don't think about it too much. If you do, you'll quickly get left behind because it affords you basically no breathing room. Even in retrospect, trying to untangle its time-twisting shenanigans can quickly become somewhat frustrating. I'm still not sure if it all works according to its own rules, actually. It's best not to think about it, really. In fact, it almost straight-up tells you this. It just wants you to go along for the ride, content with feeling instead of thinking. At the same time, though, it's always a cold and calculating affair, largely devoid of emotion. Plus, it still spends a fair amount of time trying to impress you with its pseudo science. It has a really strange, consistently fast pace that makes the entire movie seem as though it takes place within a single scene. You aren't given time to properly orient yourself, which leads to an unnecessarily confusing experience. As does the fact that most of the picture's core players just come out of nowhere; it's really hard to know who's who and, even, why they're doing what they're doing (aside from apparently saving the entire world). It isn't just the core concept that's difficult to grasp, it's the plot itself. That's because it only indulges in the absolute minimum amount of exposition. Actually, it arguably uses less than necessary. If you're going to do that and make the experience of watching the movie a puzzle in itself, maybe don't make its underlying concept be one of the most difficult to explain in recent cinema. Still, as I mentioned earlier, you can just about follow it right the way through and it's usually entertaining. It's engaging on an intellectual level rather than an emotional one (certainly the less impactful of the two), but it's engaging nevertheless. It also undeniably contains some remarkable, mostly in-camera set-pieces. The depiction of inverse time, a distinct and often visually arresting idea, is convincing and compelling, at its best during the flick's varied action scenes. The film is interesting and, at times, clever, even though it is arbitrarily enigmatic. Nobody can deny it's unique, especially for a big-budget blockbuster. Though it has plenty of problems and, perhaps, isn't as good as it could have been, it's still an enjoyable and generally well-achieved experience. 7/10",Tenet
26,dromasca,Christopher Nolan Plays Again with Time,5,28 August 2021,"In 'Tenet', the film that became famous for its complicated pandemic launch in 2020, screenwriter and director Christopher Nolan plays again with time. It is one of his recurring themes and the one that ensured his first great success with 'Memento'. More than two decades have passed since then, and the London-born director seems to be able to get any budget and attract the most outstanding acting and technical talents to turn his ideas into films for the big screens. 'Tenet', however, had a strange fate also because many spectators saw it in their own salons and not in cinemas halls that were closed due to the pandemic. It's a film that only Nolan could have written and directed, and like for many of his other films, the opinions of the viewers are extremely polarised. I confess that 'Tenet' left me confused, and this is not only because it has a complicated story, which uses phenomena from a science of physics that I do not claim to have understood.It is one of those films reviewers should write as little as possible about their story, so as not to rob the interest and pleasure of those who have not seen it yet. We are dealing with heroes who save the world as in movies like James Bond or Mission Impossible, and we are also dealing with time travel based on a scientific premise explained in detail. Intense efforts and a lot of money have been invested in both directions. It is an almost non-stop action film, which fits well with the mentioned blockbusters, both in terms of visual effects and geographical sceneries (we are taken through Mumbai, Kiev, Oslo, Geneva, Vietnam, etc.). Time travel is detailed from the perspective of several characters, and lovers of temporal paradoxes can enjoy several such situations. The film has undeniable visual qualities and the originality of the special effects has been deservedly rewarded with an Academy Award.My problem with Christopher Nolan's films is that they fail to engage me emotionally while I am watching. I always appreciate them more retrospectively, when I think about them and when I intellectually decant what I have seen, but I have to make an effort to follow them in real time. This is exactly what has happened to me now. I'm a fan of action movies, but the combination with temporal science fiction was difficult to watch and made the story confusing at times. I am also passionate about intelligent science fiction, but in 'Tenet' the abundance of explanations seemed excessive to me, they did not make the story clearer and there was no need for so much science for viewers who are accustomed to cinematic pretexts. One of the qualities of the film is that the characters evolve or are gradually revealed to us, many of them being more than stereotypes, but even so they did not manage to involve me emotionally.John David Washington is an anti-hero cast in a role similar to those routinely undertaken by Tom Cruise, and the scenes in which he interacts with the character played by Elizabeth Debicki are about the only ones that caused mes some real emotion. Another interesting casting is that of Keneth Branagh as a 'bad guy' like in the James Bond movies. In general, it is a first-rate cast, but I don't think any role here will remain among the 'best' of the stars in the credits. It was a pleasure to watch Michael Caine again, even if in one scene only, especially since he plays a character named Sir Michael. Otherwise, the film was for me visually spectacular, but confusing. I recommend future viewers not to try to understand too much, or to wait until after watching, when the opinion about what they saw will start to improve. I personally miss the simplicity of the idea and the minimalism in 'Memento'.",Tenet
27,ThomasDrufke,"Chaotic, Inventive, Exciting but Perhaps Too ""Inside Baseball""",8,9 December 2020,"It's crazy that it's been several months since I checked this film out in theaters (one of the few times I visited the cinema during the pandemic) and thought that this may signal the return for theaters overall. Of course, we know that wasn't the case, but I'm still not quite sure why I never reviewed Tenet back in August. Perhaps I was hoping to see it for a second time to help wrap my head around my feelings after the first viewing.I still to this day don't know how I feel about this film. I think it's still one of Nolan's weakest films (which to the normal director would be a massive compliment) but I was truly hoping for something spectacular here. To a certain extent, Nolan does give an incredible effort to reinventing certain aspects of filmmaking but was it truly enough? Will the mainstream audience think this film is too ""inside baseball"", yeah maybe. And even for a film nut like me, it is very dense and at times difficult to comprehend. But I would much rather be challenged than see the same old action film over and over again.With all that being said, it's hard not to hope Nolan goes in a new direction for his next idea. I'm not sure if it's adapting a book or someone else's original script (like he has done a few times) or just taking his scale smaller (like with The Prestige) but I'm still looking forward to whatever it is he does next. Here's to the future of filmmaking!8.2/10",Tenet
28,Cineanalyst,The Inverted Tenets of a Cinematic Palindrome,9,24 January 2021,"""Tenet,"" the title itself a palindrome, is brilliantly reflexive. Unfortunately, a lot of space has been given to its financial failure to lure audiences back to theatres during the pandemic--unable to surpass in box office even pre-pandemic duds such as ""Bad Boys For Life"" (2020). Given that the picture's ""inverted"" time travelers wear masks and must avoid touching themselves also tempts one to consider the production as prescient of the coming contagion. But, no, ""Tenet"" may be much more rewarding than that. Considerable time has also been spent on the physics of the picture's time travel to make sense of initial confusion over the plot, which understandable though that is, risks missing the boat. Much, if not most, of writer-producer-director Christopher Nolan's oeuvre is about deception--reversibly, within and without the frame. ""Ignorance is our ammunition."" It's a cinema of illusion--internally consistent in entirety, but not realistic and with initial confusion over plotting for characters within and the spectator without. ""Lying is standard operating procedure."" To accept the premise that ""Tenet"" is merely a loud, action-packed, effects-laden spectacle, confusing because it's senseless, is rather to accept continuing to be deceived. Divided in sections though it may be, together there is an algorithm to make sense of this ""twilight world.""One may as well believe that, say, ""Memento"" (2000) is about Leonard avenging the murder of his wife, ""The Prestige"" (2006) about the unknowability of magic, that Bruce Wayne isn't Batman, ""Inception"" (2016) not a dream, or that ""Interstellar"" (2014) is just about a lonely girl talking to her bookshelf. They're all about the shared, on and off screen, uncovering of the deception. Todd McGowan, for one, wrote an entire book (""The Fictional Christopher Nolan"") about how the foundation of his films are lies--and discovering the truth in them. The lie Leonard told himself, the source of the magic, the false narratives provided by Batman or his villains to save or attack Gotham, the idea implanted and accepted as their own within another's mind, and the intergalactic misleading to save and endanger lives across planets. Figuring such out, including in ""Tenet,"" though, is to just put order to the ultimate illusion that is cinema, an art of deception--actors pretending to be characters, time and space rearranged, recorded for posterity to see. ""Tenet"" may be the most thoroughly reflexive of Nolan's cinema of illusion, and it requires the future spectator to mediate the truth of that lie.From the opening scene, this is a wonderful meta-narrative construction. It takes place at an opera, so we have art on stage as viewed by an audience, as with movies. A performance of constant, loud music, as with the score of ""Tenet."" From the stage, the audience is violently attacked--gunfire, chases, explosions, and all--and put to sleep into a dream--a dream shared by ""wake up the Americans"" protagonist (John David Washington). Enveloping the surrogate audience on screen in a shared dream with the protagonist is even more complex than that beloved other, concussion-inspired time-travel interaction between Doc Brown and Marty McFly after each knocked themselves in the noggin (one of which also involved loud music) in ""Back to the Future"" (1985). Regardless, this opening act introduces us to what the entire rest of the picture will be: a relentless spectacle of a dream assaulting the audience's senses. It's the original inversion, mirror image of the movie--a reflection of the real audience viewing the picture itself.The window motif is clever in this regard, too. There are the ""proving windows"" outside of the ""Turnstiles"" that split the doppelgängers as two reverse, mirror-image films beside each other. This is further reflected in the use of windows as an analogy for the cinematic screen with their use between the regular and inverted worlds otherwise: the protagonist breaks through one at the opera, there are the many car windows, as well as the window through which the protagonist watches Sator (Kenneth Branagh) handle inverted gold. Even two of the exposition-heavy scenes early on are highly reflexive pictorially. The scientist explains inversion by means of a camera, screen and replay--a scientific film given the lie by its construction within this fictional drama. Then, there's Michael Caine's requisite role of elaborating the deception--this time by his Sir Crosby providing the duped, twice-over duplicated fake Goya drawings. This is the forgery at the heart of the inner drama to be saved, of the mother (Elizabeth Debicki as Kat) and son, which seems mostly symbolic (we never really meet the kid)--maybe the Madonna and Christ child (even more mysterious than the relationship with the, perhaps related, white savior of the picture). And all this in case it weren't obvious that ""Tenet"" is about storytelling by its main character simply being known as ""the protagonist,"" villains as ""antagonists,"" which are dramatic and literary terms, or from all the talk by Neil (Robert Pattinson) about the drama of using a plane in their heist.Besides the analogies that cinema is a stage, a story, a window, a mirror, a dream, or the art of duplication and doppelgängers, the metaphor of film-as-death is also present. The protagonist ""dies"" early on, after he symbolically smashes through the opera window into the movie. This goes to the notion that film, especially when on Nolan's beloved, actual celluloid as a series of still photographs, is a kind of death, of capturing living motion as deadly inert images, if only to reanimate their doppelgängers by turbine-like projection in the afterlife on a screen. We discover later that the other manipulators of time--Sator, Neil, Kat--are also marked by death.All this would be interesting enough on its own, but ""Tenet"" goes further by employing especial cinematic techniques for its reflexive, ""inverted"" deception: principally, cinematography and montage, although there's also considerable exploration of sound, from the score to the recordings left for posterity and the backwards dialogue and sound effects. As I've said elsewhere, time travel is a neat notion cinematically, because the reordering of time is analogous to editing. Even linear narratives omit much and may include flashbacks or remembrances such as that yacht holiday in Vietnam that's central to the plot of ""Tenet."" I love how much international hopping this picture does, too. It travels through both time and space. This is incredibly felicitous with Nolan's usual, cutting-on-action, no-lingering, kinetic pacing. One moment, characters are in one country discussing whatever, and the next moment they're in another state executing their plans. Cinema that may go anytime and anywhere, via all the cinematic tricks of editing and photography.There are also some appreciable allusions scattered throughout to this framework. That the protagonist and Sir Crosby order the same meal, but rather in reverse, the security system reversion making the heist at the free port possible, regular and inverted cars driving in opposite directions on the same side of the road, the inversion of Kat's willingness to use the gun, in addition to the aforementioned remembered flashback, and the climactic reversion to the wind turbines and death from whence the picture emerged. Even that the future turns out to be fighting the present because of global warming is a nice touch, as a counterattack to the present's pollution already being an attack on the future. An eloquent symmetry to the algorithm. Furthermore, five words in the film refer to the Sator Square, real artifacts containing an elaborate Latin palindrome.To continue traveling back in time, ""Tenet"" is a 21st-century elaboration of the trick films of cine-magician pioneer Georges Méliès. Under the simplistic dichotomy attributed to film historian Georges Sadoul, the red and blue timelines established since the birth of cinema were the realism exemplified by the Lumière actualities and the illusions represented by Méliès trick films. Later film historians, like Tom Gunning, redefined early cinema as one of attractions either way. While ""Tenet"" is certainly a narrative film--in the tradition of the likes of ""Casablanca"" (1942), which it paraphrases, and a convoluted one to boot, it's also in the service of that early cinema priority on presentation of spectacle. The reverse chronology of ""Memento,"" the magic of ""The Prestige,"" the superhero fantasy of the Batman trilogy, the dream of ""Inception,"" exploration of space in ""Interstellar"" and, now, cinema as inverted space and time travel here. Nolan and company employ form and illusion to conceal and reveal reflections of, to refer to, that very cinematic form and illusion. As they wrote in Latin, ""sator arepo tenet opera rotas."" How's that for a palindrome.",Tenet

Like Seinfeld once said, if you choose your detergent based on its ability to remove bloodstains, you have bigger problems than laundry. If you need to watch the film several times, preferably with subtitles (quoting from one of the top rated reviews here), you are not here for the movie. Or the bear hunting.",Tenet
31,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,TENET --> TENET,7,28 August 2021,"This movie isn't bad.But everyone expects something different from Nolan. I guess not every movie C. Nolan made after ""Interstellar"" will be appreciated. I don't know, I could be wrong. The idea of this movie was interesting. But it was a little weak. The acting was a bit weak, frankly. But still, I'm fine.",Tenet
32,851222,First real disappointment from Mr. Christopher Nolan,6,26 August 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.I just came back from a premiere of ""Tenet"" (2020), a hugely anticipated new movie by Mr. Christopher Nolan - my favorite director. I'm a huge Nolan's fan, saw all his movie in a theater and they all left me speechless and i even consider ""Interstellar"" as my favorite film of this millennium - i'm a real Nolan's fan boy.And with my broken heart i can only say after seeing ""Tenet"" that it was a first real disappointment by this brilliant director. This time Mr. Nolan has outdone himself, and not in a good way. Story and plot were a mess. Its not ""Inception"" by any means - that movie had a very simple idea and plot which was put into this intriguing world and concept - it wasn't difficult to follow because you always knew exactly what was the goal, who is who and etc. ""Tenet"" does not had any of that. While i enjoyed the plot for a around first 40% of its run time, later its just become so convoluted that farther it went the more i was scratching my head and eventually started to rolling my eyes when Robert Pattinson's and John David Washington's characters were describing the plot to each other, jumping for and between, reading between the lines and etc - it was simply way to complicated and eventually convoluted. By the end of this movie i really didn't care what was going on nor did i tried to understand - the movie's plot and storytelling lost me completely. Its not Nolan ""the director"" who wasn't good here, but its Noland ""the screenwriter"" who i think overdone himself this time, and not in a good way. The good things in this movie were for me performance by Kenneth Branagh who was excellent villain, cinematography and basically all the production values in this movie - they are first rate. Unfortunately plot and storytelling were below average - they just didn't for me at all.Overall, unfortunately the year 2020 was a terrible year not only because of the virus, but also it was a year when we got a first flop from Mr. Nolan. Its not that its a bad movie, like i said production values are first rate but other then that you will be scratching your head in disbelieve of how convoluted and cold this movie is. For his next feature Mr. Nolan should slow it down with plot and maybe take his brother as writer to help - together they can put plots and screenplays like no other. ""Tenet"" unfortunately is not the case.",Tenet
33,atlasmb,A Disappointment,6,12 September 2020,"The best word to describe this film is ""disappointing"". This production had so much going for it, and certain aspects of the film work, but as a whole it falls short.On the positive side, ""Tenet"" includes some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in a film. And the concept of the film is adventurous, perhaps too adventurous.Conversely, the entire film is haunted by badly flawed sound editing. I don't know how it could be unintentional, but much of the dialogue is annoyingly difficult to hear. It is muffled or obliterated by a soundtrack that doesn't augment, it competes. And much of the background music sounds less like music than a nearly atonal wall of sound, like a ubiquitous droning. The balance between dialogue and other ambient sounds is also problematic.As for the acting, Kenneth Branagh is very effective as the villainous Andrei Sator. Elizabeth Debicki is convincing as the beautiful wife of Sator, who becomes a central part of the film's intrigue. But John David Washington plays his lead role as ""The Protagonist"" emotionally flat. Bond is reserved, Bourne is stone cold, but The Protagonist shows no more feelings than a robot, despite the fact that he makes existential decisions in the story based on emotions.Still, I am glad I saw the film, if only for its ambitious stunt work and visual editing.The meaning of the tile is crypic, by I suspect ""Tenet""---a palindrome--- was used because it sounds basically the same spoken forward or backward.The time travel aspects of the film have plot holes, but not so many that I could not suspend disbelief. It's just that darn audio problem that drags this film down. And to a lesser extent, some scenes that were confusing because it was difficult to tell characters apart.",Tenet
34,westsideschl,KISS,4,9 January 2021,"Couple of problems. Didn't enjoy the movie. Lacked clarity and despite it being a fantasy the often overused factual science errors made it cheaply implausible. Actors chosen seemed dull, lifeless; not believable. The overall theme of someone in the future traveling to the past (our present) is (a.) not possible; period (b.) to destroy this past (our present) so that there is no future seemed absurd (duh, future us there are easier ways). Although, at the rate we're going with our environmental destruction we're doing it well enough on our own. Didn't get the plutonium angle as it's easy to get a small amount for a single bomb. However, not explained in the movie, but building the fissionable bomb apparatus is no walk in the park. The nine containers of code made no sense. Just an excessively complex script that should have adhered to the KISS principle.
On a positive note extra star for the background to the movie as explained in the special features - the intricacies & expense to create the scenes was more fascinating than the movie. Also, all the site locations: Estonia; Italy; U.K.; Denmark; India; Norway.",Tenet
35,tabuno,Good but Over-Reliance on Time Twisting Confusion,8,4 September 2020,"This new big spectacle sci fi movie from Christopher Nolan (Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk) offers up a temporal twist in a new guise that seems to become so wound up around itself that the movie turns into a sort of jumbled confusion and the redundant initial cuteness of the use of time in the movie loses its original compelling fascination. The contemporary television series Dr. Who dealt with time much better in terms of ease of watching it with more believable compelling understanding. A bold movie along with unfamiliar faces makes an original imprint on sci fi, but instead of a full-blown action sci fi thriller, it would have been more effective as a Solaris-type or Adjustment Bureau production. There was simply too much going on in terms of massive action thrills and over-reliance of special effects that the story couldn't handle well. To Nolan's credit, the movie avoided the typical overt sexual overtures and introduced an effective potent antagonist, one of the strongest and intense in a long time. In some ways Hunter Killer (2018) a powerful underwater, special ops action thriller would have been a great template for this movie Tenet to have followed.",Tenet
36,The-Sarkologist,You really need to see it Twice,9,20 November 2020,"Christopher Nolan certainly knows how to experiment. The interesting thing though is that when it comes to most experimental films, they tend to fall into the category of arthouse, and if they are lucky, they will become cult classics. Not so with Nolan - he makes block busters, while experimenting at the same time, as is the case with this film. Then again, I also suspect that he has the finances that are able to produce films such as this one, and with a steady stream of blockbusters under his belt, we can expect more into the future.Some have suggested that this is a time travel film, and well, it really isn't. It actually has more to do with time inversion, namely that you are able to reverse time, and then travel back to certain points in the past, and then reverse it again. Initially it seems that it only applies to objects, that is until you go deeper into the film and find out what is actually going on.Yeah, Nolan certainly has a gift of suddenly changing the tempo at a moment's notice, and this definitely happens about halfway through the film. Also, you will see things happening, and even events being mentioned, that make no sense until you get to the end. In fact, it is one of those films that you really need to watch a second time to actually pick up on a lot of things that are going on, and have a much better understanding of how brilliant the concept is.Some have suggested that it is like Memento, in that it finishes halfway through, but no, that is not the case. As I mentioned, it is about time inversion, and while there are comments that they are only halfway through the mission, there is a good reason for this, and also you probably don't want to be board with the protagonist going around setting everything up.While the protagonist is good, Neil is even better, namely because there is so much going on with that character, particularly when it becomes clear that these two characters are working on different timelines, something that isn't made clear until the end, but upon watching a second time becomes pretty clear. As I said, this movie needs to be watched more than once to really understand how good it actually is (and it is probably a great way of doubling the cinematic take as well).Honestly, I really do love how Nolan experiments with time in his movies, even in a movie like Dunkirk, where things are happening that you have no idea why, until you get to the end of the film and it all suddenly makes sense. This one goes to a completely different level though, with multiple characters operating on multiple time lines, with things being set up in the background that you simply cannot see, but becomes pretty clear the second time round. Yes, this is definitely another one of his masterpieces.",Tenet
37,briancham1994,The audience is now deaf,6,12 September 2020,"Whoever did the sound mixing should be fired. The sounds and music were far louder than the dialogue which made it impossible to tell what anyone was saying. As for the story itself, I found it gimmicky, simplistic and predictable. I admire the amount of work that went into bringing this idea to life, especially the technical aspect which was perfectly executed with visual amazement and action. However, it felt like an artificial and forced physics demonstration with very jumpy pacing more than a genuine story with an emotional core. At times it dabbles in a bit of character depth (Elizabeth Debicki's character being the real star here) but this is balanced by some rather baffling or blunt moments as well. It was fun to watch this movie imagining that Washington's protagonist is actually the same as his character from BlacKkKlansman (2018).",Tenet
38,Thanos_Alfie,Highly recommend it...,8,29 November 2020,"""Tenet"" is a Sci-Fi - Action movie in which we watch a man fighting to save the entire world from destruction. Real time is something relevant and everything can change when you play with it but it's very important who is in control of it and who is not.I have to admit that I was expecting this movie and I had high expectation by it. For one more time Christopher Nolan changes everything and makes us think about many different aspects of life. He succeeded on making us talk, discuss and think of his movie for a long time since we watched it. I believe that Christopher Nolan for one more time did an excellent job on both direction and writing. The interpretations of both John David Washington who played as Protagonist and Robert Pattinson who played as Neil were simply amazing and they both did a great job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clémence Poésy's who played as Barbara, Kenneth Branagh's who played as Sator and Michael Caine's who played as Crosby. Finally, I have to say that ""Tenet"" is an amazing movie and if you are a fan of Christopher Nolan's movies and especially of ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" then I am sure that you will consider it as a masterpiece, but even if you are not I believe that you will enjoy it too.",Tenet
39,cruise01,Absolutely amazing with an epic storytelling and action sequences.,10,6 September 2020,"Tenet (5 out of 5 stars).Tenet is an awesome spy film that takes action and an epic thrill ride with its story. Christopher Nolan has done it again with a complex story which may require a couple of viewings to fully understand the time inversion concept. I did find the film to be little less complicated than Inception. As your put in The protagonist shoes (John David Washington) who is joined in this world of espionage and time inversion. Like one character tells him. The less you understand it. The better. Which does make for a better awesome experience just enjoying the movie as it goes along.Its better to watch the movies story for yourself without spoilering it. Besides its about a Protagonist who is not given a name. Is thrown in a world of espionage to stop Sator (Kenneth Branagh) from creating world war 3.The plot is epic. The movie is filled with a lot of action. A lot of practical action stunt work. The opening sequence was intense with a shoot out in a opera house. Was confusing on what was going on but well done after a few mins it all makes sense. The action sequences is loud, big, and breathtaking. The music score by Ludwig Gorransson is amazing. His electronic and loud scores really made the movie an amazing ride. Being loud in every action scene. Creating the intense feeling.The cast ensemble is great too. John David Washington is great playing as a mysterious Protagonist who is in a shadowy organization. Robert Pattinson is also great playing Neill who accompany the main character. And is involved in the action. Elizabeth Debicki is great playing as Kat, a lady who is stuck in between with the bad guy and her freedom. Dimple Kapadia playing a character which everytime she speaks. She sounds like a character from the Matrix. Michael Cain in a small brief role was also good. Kenneth Branagh is great as the villain.The visual effects. Cinematography and set pieces are all an cinematic experience that deserves to be seen on the big screen. The 747 plane crashing was intense. The epic car chases with time moving forward and backward was thrilling. The fight sequences was insane. The epic climax. Where it goes crazy than ever where soldiers are moving forward and backward in a battlefield was intense with explosions and shoot outs.Christopher Nolan script and direction is one of the best. Making this one of his best movies yet. Kind of feels like a James Bond kind of movie mixed with a little science fiction. From the globe trotting set pieces. Action and a plot.Tenet is one of the best movies of the year that needs to be seen on the big screen.",Tenet
40,zkonedog,Fascinating Concept That Lacks Humanity Behind It,7,7 September 2020,"Director Christopher Nolan is now well-known for his high-concept flicks, whether dealing with literal magic, the cosmos, the gritty realities of a superhero universe, or even the logic of dreamworlds. There's perhaps no one better at tackling such gargantuan undertakings. Yet, Nolan's films never come off as overly technical, as they all are grounded by incredibly nuanced characters that are just as important as the thought-pieces. Until Tenet, that is.For a very basic overview, Tenet introduces the viewer to The Protagonist (John David Washington), a man who is thrust into one could be called a temporal war for humanity. In the future, humans have learned to change the entropy of physical options or people, essentially sending them backwards through the flow of time rather than how we normally experience it. They are using this power to run covert operations with the ultimate goal of trying to permanently reverse the entropy of the world, killing millions in the process. The presumed leader of this movement is Sator (Kenneth Branagh), and the only ""in"" to get to him is wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), who is trying to escape his entrapment of her and her son.Because Tenet has Nolan behind the camera, it almost goes without saying that it is expertly crafted/shot. A 7/10 ranking is about the lowest I could give it, as it was entertaining to me at the very least.The reason why I have it on the low end of that spectrum? There's no doubt that the reverse-entropy idea is fascinating. A different sort of time-travel from that of, say, Back To The Future. Yet, the film itself goes out of its way to constantly remind the viewer not to spend the entire runtime trying to ""figure it out"". It simply has to be rudimentarily accepted, which is okay because this is cinema after all. However, this approach requires strong characters or dilemmas to take the focus off the un-solvable mystery, and that is what Tenet sorely lacks.The evolution of Kat's character is clearly what Nolan intends to be the ""humanity"" of the picture, but it doesn't hit home as well as similar emotional climaxes from his other films. Perhaps a second viewing would/will change my mind on this point, but as it stands after my first watch I never really felt like this crucial angle connected with me like it should have.Another thing I found odd is the revelation--spoken by a character late in the proceedings--that the reason future-us wants to reverse the flow of time is because Earth become inhabitable due to global warming and thus the only way to continue living is ""backwards"". What a golden idea--yet it isn't even hinted at until the end and even then completely dropped after its utterance in favor of a different endgame focus. It really felt, to me, like that idea needed to be much bigger in this film somehow.Like I said, Tenet is still an entertaining movie to watch. I don't think Christopher Nolan is physically capable of making a ""bad"" movie. Yet, with Tenet, he has a film that tells its audience to not actively solve its central puzzle-box, but then doesn't give them enough to distract them from that very task.",Tenet
41,Floated2,Mind blowing visually but confusing,7,31 December 2020,"Tenet released earlier during the summer as one of the bigger blockbuster films during the pandemic times. Apparently it did not make as much money at the box office as expected. Had relatively high expectations as this is a Christopher Nolan film and his films are always good and highly anticipated.The film is quite lengthy but it seems to be split into several different parts making the pacing feel not so long or as if it drags on. Overall it is well acted, it is well shot but the story is hard to follow and does get confusing. At times it was difficult in fully hearing the dialogue as the instrumental throughout does get loud.Tenet's story and plot is interesting and watchable but overall it seems to require very close attention to detail while paying attention. The sci-fi aspect is well done. Having feel one did not quite understand everything fully on the first watch. This most definitely feels like a film that requires more than one watch. Perhaps in due time will rewatch.",Tenet
42,eddie_baggins,A unique and fast-paced blockbuster event,8,26 November 2020,"Disclaimer - this review is based off the 4K Imax Laser Presentation of the film.After many months, many days wondering if I would ever get to see the film the way in which Christopher Nolan intended to be seen and much thought as to whether or not the film could possibly live up to expectations and save cinema along the way, I have finally seen the famed directors latest mind-bending offering that may've struggled to reach the heights of his previous films in a very different landscape but still manages to be an often jaw-dropping thrill ride that is exactly the type of offering we need at this present time.Soon coming to home release, Tenet is the type of film that deserves to be watched on the biggest screen available to your viewing needs with Nolan embedding his take on the James Bond style action/thriller with ample set pieces, sci-fi oddities and a musical score that will likely have your ears ringing from the moment the films explosive first scene begins.Shrouded in much mystery before release, Tenet's plot points and movements have started to seep their way into everyday conversations but if possible, avoiding these analysis's and spoiler-filled discussions will ensure the film is going to provide you with much entertainment as John David Washington's Protagonist gets caught up in a dangerous mission that will either doom the world should he fail or save it should he manage to get his head around a time-inverting scenario that you shouldn't even pretend to understand on first viewing.It's almost impossible to talk about any further details of Tenet's plot without giving too much away but suffice to say the staples of Nolan's filmography are readily on show throughout with carefully staged destruction, heists, messing of time itself and a disdain for character development or emotional development all found within his latest piece of original Hollywood goodness.It's rare to watch such a high-profile release in the modern era where you never feel comfortable with understanding or predicting where things are or where they may be heading, it may even be off-putting for some viewers who might find themselves frustrated by the films lack of explanation (perfectly summed up by its without context opening set-piece) or rushed delivery of important bits of information but by the time everything ends and you ponder what has come before, you realize Nolan gave you enough to satisfy your questions without giving it all away, something that is likely to be chipped away at as viewers return for multiple viewings in the future.Rollicking along at a pace that would make most films embarrassed, there's barely a dull moment found throughout this eye-popping escapade with Washington and MVP Robert Pattinson on peak charismatic form and Nolan just begging you to come along for the ride, Tenet may not be peak Nolan but its blockbuster filmmaking at its most playful, exciting and original.Final Say -With issues to be found no doubt with plot coherence, audio mixes and a lack of human connection, Tenet can still be enjoyed as a break-neck piece of big budget movie making that provides an endless rush of thrills and spills all centered around a deeply trippy plot that will be explored for years yet to come.4 cheese graters out of 5",Tenet
43,Tweetienator,Not For Everyone,5,11 November 2020,"There is some good action going on, but Inception I found more exciting - action- and story-wise. Tenet is (over-)complicated and I don't know if I really understood everything but I agree with Schoppenhauer (a German philosopher) - nothing is easier than to write in such a way that no man can understand it; but as nothing is more difficult than to express important thoughts in such a way that everyone must understand them. In this sense Tenet is a fail, I was not impressed by the story nor the ""physics"" or world-building, and I dare to say, like most directors, when time-travel and such is in a story involved, Nolan failed. Anyway, still an interesting and entertaining piece.",Tenet

Better watch Terminator 2 or James Bond films.
The character of Priya n the shooting in Mumbai is added jus to attract pseudo intellectual viewers from my beloved country India.
The rote learned physics students from my beloved country will be in awe of this film.
Nolan aint aware that physics students in India need to work more in the laboratories to put the theoretical knowledge to use.
The wannabe critics from my country will unnecessary give this film more stars so that they dont look outcasts.",Tenet
45,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Groundbreaking spy film with Mind-blowing timebreaking theme. Soulless but Nolan's Most Complex film till date.,8,1 September 2020,"Tenet (2020) :
Movie Review -I can say it loud and clear that, we haven't seen something groundbreaking like this before and we may never see something like this. The reason for it is, Tenet is based on a time breaking concept which crosses all the barriers of physics, time flow, inversion, reversion, past, present and future tense. We haven't been introduced to Time-squeezing maneuvers before and in Tenet we get to see multiple dimensions running simultaneously which makes it a crazy visual experience. I mean at one moment it feels like how did they shoot this scene? How did they edited it? How did they even think of writing such a scene? It all goes beyond imagination in this unseen world of Tenet and one must prepare his the brain before watching it because this is going to shake your mind with complexions.The story of Tenet is pretty much predictable and believe me this is an insult of Nolan but the master had some different plans as he tells this predictable story in unpredictable way. A mission of saving the World from extinction is anything but not simple. Tenet is intricate but how much? If i could count it in numbers then it is 11 out 10 i mean one step higher than where your rating ends. When it comes to understanding the film there are different possibilities for sure, like, in first watch you might understand it completely, or you might not understand it and dislike it but then you might understand it in 2nd viewing and find it mind-boggling stuff or something because it is complex indeed. Not just any regular complex show but something really confusing. For instance, i can say that, Inception was lot easier to understand than Tenet and i mean it. I hope you know what i mean, any smart movie buff will surely get it.Tenet has really got lot of good performances from talented cast members. I can't name all but surely the main leading cast is amazing which includes John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh and other supporting actors. The writing, like I said before crosses all the limits of complexity and it took me a little while to realise what just happened, what did they just said and what was it all about. High chances that Tenet needs to be watched twice to understand all the detailings otherwise you just don't get it properly. Thank god it doesn't leave you with any questions at the end as there is a one solid end to all the theories.Technical aspects of Tenet are truly amazing. The background score will win you over in the opening scene itself and then there are lot of it keep coming up. Cinematography is on some next level as we just can't imagine half the people running backwards and rest half running opposite at the same time. The same goes to the visual team as they achieve artistically groundbreaking visuals which were never seen before and might never be seen in future. Dialogues are too dedal and with the help of Subtitles you can keep them in memory. Director Christopher Nolan has left me speechless yet again. I am not sure about numbers that how many times I've said the same thing. If there was anyone who could have thought of handling hell of a complex film like Tenet then it was only Nolan and nobody else and he didn't disappoint. I am shocked and stunned by his thinking and vision that how every time he comes up with something mind blowing and yet makes it feel mind blowing every time? I mean we never feel fed up by his news ideas and we never even get bored of watching the same film Multiple times. Without a shadow of doubt, Nolan is the best director in the world (of his time) and i am proud to be his Fan.Tenet offers something out of the borders even if you think that you are ready for unlimited features and mind-shaking cinematic graphics. The only problem with Tenet is, it feels soulless after all. The emotional angle doesn't work at any level hence the feelings for the characters never pick. Otherwise, it is a complete package of mind shattering concept, groundbreaking visuals, technical brilliance, atmospheric tension and Nolan's timebreaking vision which makes it a wonderful Cinematic Experience. Highly recommended ""But only for intelligent cine viewers.""RATING - 8/10*",Tenet

47,imseeg,Start walking backwards. You think that is cool? I dont. I think it is silly.,5,5 December 2020,"The bad:
This story is completely silly and a complete mess. And it's too long. (2 and a half hours!) Let's face it, how long can a director capture an audience with a gimmick of walking backwards through life? We did it as a kid, walking backwards. It was fun then. But making an entire movie about it and thinking you are smart? Who were they kiddin'?More bad: let's not even talk about the ridiculous editing pace of this movie. A simple conversation between 2 persons is being cut as if it were an action sequence. The actors AND the acting aren't very impressive either: lots of silly accents (Robert Pattison with his ""English"" accent) and lots of B-actors without real charisma.The good:
This movie is really intrigueing at the start. And quite exciting as well. There is lots of frenzy like action from the get go. Although I didnt understand anything that went on, from the very beginning, it all looked quite cool and fascinating. Not understanding can be interesting...More good: the movie looks beautiful. The design is impressive. Some of the camerawork is pretty classy. There is also a frenzy like feel throughout this movie, which I liked.But in the end this movie is a gimmick that failed. It's a wannabe smart movie,that upon closer inspection is rather silly...",Tenet
48,southdavid,? Top Spot ?,8,1 September 2020,"Oh... ""Tenet"" .. where to start?... lets go with the plot synopsis first.
The Protagonist (John David Washington) is a counter terrorist agent who uncovers a monumental threat to human existence in the hands of arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). His investigation gets him close to Sator's wife, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) who hates her husband and only remains in his life for son they share. Only when he discovers the true nature of the threat, can the Protagonist begin to arrive at even a concept of fighting back.
That doesn't really say much. Essentially it's a Bond film in all but name, but with one high concept idea incorporated. That time for an object can be inversed, so bullets can be pulled out of walls and into a gun and crashed cars will flip back onto its wheels to join a chase - to go further in explanation is to drift into spoiler territory, and I don't want to do that. I can't decide if there's too much going in in ""Tenet"" or not enough. Certainly the first half was a bit of a confusing blur of ""We need to talk to this person about this, and then this person about this, who tells them another name of a person. But that does get better, and you settle into a middle third heist and car chase that is spectacular. Then the final third doesn't really seem to do as much with the concept as you'd hoped it might.
Performances are good. John David Washington has been a star on the rise for a while and although this character isn't much more than a cypher for the audience, he's as compelling as ever. Robert Pattinson is great, I think this might actually be the first film of his I've seen since his Harry Potter supporting role and I'm now eager to see more of the work he's done in between. Kenneth Branagh is fine, but his role is a fairly standard foreign villain stuff - as sadly, is Elizabeth Debicki's role, which might as well been the same character from ""The Night Manager"". The film is, of course, immaculately shot and edited. The score is interesting, all reversed notes that you hear in both directions and it's clear that everything in the film is done practically, or ""in camera"", rather than with CGI. One final negative though, which I had prescribed to the screening that I was in, but I see it in a couple of other reviews here, the sound mix was terrible - some dialogue, particularly from Branagh's character were inaudible. Again - this might be just the cinema I was at, but it was disappointing.
Much like with ""Interstellar"" - I won't for a minute try to argue with you that it's not good, but do I love it. Am I eager to see it again? Not really.",Tenet

50,Vartiainen,Nolan dives head first into the concept of time,7,11 October 2020,"Christopher Nolan has quite often examined the theme and idea of time in his movies. How it works, how it could be meddled with, how it could be made to work for interesting narrative. Tenet, his latest, just might be his magnum opus in that regard. It's a story about an unnamed protagonist, who gets tangled into something far larger than anything he has dealt before. Objects have been tampered with in the future and now they're travelling backwards through time, which threatens to unmake the very fabric of reality.A simple enough concept on paper. Well, simple-ish. And while the plot of Tenet isn't the hardest to understand, Nolan does his best to create as much spectacle out of it as he can. The man has always been a masterful visual storyteller. Things happen on screen in this movie that will blow your mind. Entire action set pieces are built upon the idea that different pieces and people within them are moving in two different directions chronologically.And that makes for some really compelling cinema. Visually this is a superb film. Astonishing, grandiose, even awe-inspiring. Structurally it could be better. My friends and I exited the theatre with proverbial smoke pouring out of our ears, asking the simple question of what just happened. To Nolan's credit, he does tie of the strings well enough. The film does make sense if you think about it long enough. But it's far from elegantly told.I also wasn't sold on the characters. Nolan's films are always more driven by concepts and ideas than characters, but usually I still end up caring about them more than I did here. This is not to say the characters in this film were bad, but they also weren't that great either. Although the actors were giving it their all.I think that Nolan bit off more than he could chew with this film. Albeit only just. Tenet is a complex idea wrapped in visual spectacle and some of the finest cinematography seen in years. But it's not a movie I see myself returning to year after year.",Tenet
51,paul-allaer,"""We have been attacked by the future""",9,5 September 2020,"""Tenet"" (2020 release; 150 min.) brings the story of a CIA agent whom we get to know only as The Protagonist. As the movie opens, the Protagonist is part of a SWAT team that storms the opera house in Kiev, Ukraine, to save an exposed agent. All mayhem brakes loose, and the Protagonist is captured by the bad guys. During a rough interrogation, the Protagonist manages to bite on a cyanide pill. When he wakes up, a CIA guys tells him ""welcome to the afterlife"", and that the opera house mission was a test, and that he passed the test. The Protagonist now is tasked with a much larger project: Tenet. It's not long before the Protagonist learns that if he fails the mission, WWIII will unleash and destroy mankind... At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus (don't just call it a film) from writer-director Christopher Nolan, who has been working on this labor of love for YEARS. As I'm sure you've heard, it evolves around inverted objects and people, or some sort of reverse chronology. As soon as the movie starts, there is an immediate overload of information and action, and soon the viewer feels engulfed in a Byzantine plot. TO which I say: don't worry, just let it go. Rather than trying to understand everything as it is happening, just enjoy the experience for what it is: a mind-blowing movie going experience, pure and simple. At one point, one of the characters comments dryly: ""We have been attacked by the future"", and that about sums it up. The many elaborate action scenes are nothing short of jaw dropping spectacular (just try imagining a car chase at full speed, inverted...). John David Washington is outstanding as the Protagonist, but a special kudos to Kenneth Branagh as the Russian Andrei Sator. It's been a long time since I've seen such a great ""baddie"". The movie's production budget is a reported $200-250 million, give or take $10 mill here and there, and the movie shows it. Beware: some of the sound effects are quite overwhelming, and at times drawn out the dialogue. All that aside, this movie BEGS to be seen on the big screen, and I have zero doubt that I will see it again in the theater in the next few weeks.""Tenet"" was set for a wide release in July, but alas, a little thing called COVID-19 interfered with those plans. The movie FINALLY opened wide this weekend (after several days of sneak previews). I couldn't wait to see this, and bought tickets in advance for the Friday early evening screening at the Cinemark here in Cincinnati. Imagine my shock when it turned out there were only 4 people in the audience (including myself). This is terrible news for the movie industry, the theaters, and of course film fans all around this country. ""Tenet"" deserves better than this, and the Cinemark where I saw this at, complied with all required COVID-19 protocols. If you are a fan of earlier Christopher Nolan films like ""Inception"" and ""Memento"", I't readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater if you can, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Tenet
52,subxerogravity,"Eyes glued to the screen for what I see, but the story could not keep my mind from wondering",8,7 January 2021,"Finally watched it!Visually, it's cinematic greatness. No doubt that Christopher Nolan knows how to use a camera. I love that about him. His ability to fill a screen and make a movie perfectly loud does give me the feeling that I missed something not seeing this one in the theaters.Dunkirk gave me the same feeling, but I did not like Dunkirk that much. A lot like this movie Nolan seems to be getting far too into himself. Going down that same road of believing in the hype like M. Night Shyamalan did with Lady in the Water (cause I actually like Signs), but at least he's no Michael Bay, right? I actually like Bay for the same reason I like Nolan, they both know how to move the camera in the way that makes the movie.Also, like Bay, Nolan's stories are lame. Well, let me be fair, Bay's stories are lame Nolan's stories are confusing. It's strange how a man who can paint a great motion picture would tell a verbal story that we need to concentrate on so hard. I have no idea what this movie is about. Memento I got, Interstellar I got, inspection I got. Time travel is too much of a puzzle. I probably will have to watch it a few times to get what's happening, but realistically nothing about what they are doing captured me the first time to do another two and half hours just to get it. It did not feel like two and a half hours the one go around, in fact it was a breeze but I can't say the same for the next sitting (oddly enough, the end credits did not even seem like they were ten mins long)What I did connect with was the relationship with all the actors. John David Washington with Robert Patterson (the new Batman with the Dark Knight's old director). John David Washington with Elizabeth Debicki or maybe I was just into John David Washington. No surprise to anyone that he's got leading man chops. Also loved Kenneth Branagh in it.A lot of cool action scenes with a time travel theme all over them and layered with an awesome film score, but I'm not going to pretend that the story made any sort of scenes in order to sound smart and artistic. A good story and a smart story should be able to be told by anyone and everyone get it, but i lost interest in it earl. Sorry Nolan liked the movie a lot, didn't love it.",Tenet
53,jtindahouse,An amazing film that you will require your brain to be working at full capacity,8,22 August 2020,"I sometimes think Christopher Nolan is too smart for his own good. His movies are truly mind-blowing in terms of the complexity that is put into the story. My only fear is that the average human can't maintain that level of processing for 150 minutes. I know I couldn't during 'Tenet'. I tried so hard to keep up with the story and exactly what was happening and why, but it was ultimately too difficult on a first viewing. By the end of the film I was basically just enjoying the ride for what it was. I think I would need to see this film 3-4 times through to begin to fully understand the storyline and all its interweaving plot lines.Like in every modern Nolan film the action-sequences are nothing short of amazing. As you will have seen in the trailers, there is plane needing to be crashed into a terminal. Now most filmmakers would be happy to use CGI or miniature scale models, but not Nolan. No, Nolan decides to actually crash a plane into a building for real. Just comprehend that for a moment. I remember when actually flipping a truck in 'The Dark Knight' was the most shocking thing he had ever done.Non-linear time has been used in film a lot, but not in this way. This film feels about as original as movies ever come these days. Most of us hear an interesting scientific theory and think, that's fascinating, and go on with our day. Nolan hears one and think, I'm going to make a movie about that. He clearly learns these theories inside out too. You can tell from the complexity of the film that he knows his stuff impeccably well.The movie has a little bit of a James Bond feel to it. I thought that multiple times during the film, and then read afterwards that he was intending for something along those lines. If a sci-fi Bond film sounds like your kind of thing, then this movie is going to be a delight for you.The film does feel a little soulless overall unfortunately. A lot of characters feel like they are just there to spew information out to the audience, rather than actually having any character or memorable aspects about them. It is also a lot less funny than Nolan films usually are. His films are usually filled with hilarious little one-liners, but they were oddly vacant here. Finally, the dialogue can be a little hard to pick up throughout the film. The score and sound-effects are often so loud is drowns out what exactly is being said, which in a film this fast-paced and complicated can be an issue.I had a great time with 'Tenet' but it wasn't quite the masterpiece I had hoped for. It's an amazing production, but it certainly isn't without its flaws.",Tenet
54,elshikh4,When Style is The Tenet !,1,12 September 2020,"Imagine that you are in a hall, and someone is giving a speech by a dead language, for 2 hours and a half. Sure I can conceive your level of provocation. But what if after translating what he was saying, you discovered that he was speaking gibberish? Now, I can't conceive your level of anger!I couldn't understand a thing from this movie. While it's 150 minutes long, I have at least 150 unanswered questions. Every second is unbearable, with rare kind of bore; the bore of watching a running corpse that speaks cryptically and acts absurdly. And I didn't enjoy anything which could seduce me to watch the whole thing again. So as a movie that has leverage, through story or visuals, it doesn't!You read things like how director Christopher Nolan took more than 5 years to write the script. Ok, a right info, or a false publicity, both ways, this is so hasty script that didn't care whatsoever of building anything.As for the story, forget it, because the movie itself forgot it earlier. There is a wife who wants a divorce from an abusing husband, some plutonium, gold bars, a time machine, and unseen guys from the future. Now this gibberish was being said to you by a dead language, since the plot is tremendously arduous like a complicated maze, rather unsolvable enigma. The dialogue savored not telling you one thing clearly; even the pace of uttering it was robotic. And the editing is a villain, forcing me to believe that a computer did it all. Hence, the ugly result was robots that talk and walk, made by robot that writes and directs.It doesn't have the slightest dose of drama, overstepping abstraction to emptiness, transforming the essential into non-existent, and producing tons of confusion and repulsion. Can anybody tell me what's the lead's motive, history, or profession? What he was doing in the opera, or in the airport? And how does he survive death every time? Moreover, who is Neil? How the inverted weapons can destroy the world? What's the future guys' agenda? Just think: the heroine kisses her son, so we know that she loves him, but why not writing a situation to feel that?! The answer of this, and else, is laziness. The same laziness that made the movie's protagonist named simply ""the protagonist""!To save you more pains, let's jump to the climactic sequence: The shootout is a farce. I challenge you to comprehend who was doing what, or who came from the future to save who, and how he did it. The evil man suddenly monologues to the protagonist by a fabricated phone call. Generally, the movie has one of the biggest loads of fabrication I have ever seen. The editing is faster than your attention, and every attempt to understand a thing always ends unsuccessfully. Then a final scene that talks to itself, since the movie lost you already, and still insists on gibberish!Nolan seems haunted by James Bond movies badly. He thinks that changing the scenery, from nation to another, and stuffing the time with action sequences, yet without real plot or logic--can make an enjoyable movie anyway. But you know what? In Bond movies, we have more solid characters, even if paper thin, more comprehensible events, more dazzling action, and - most importantly - no annoying timeline!Speaking of which, the movie is highly annoying for the mind. The matter of moving normally in an inverted world is awfully fatiguing for the viewer, especially with the stingiest expositions, a cold-blooded killer of a dialogue, and that villainous editing!The reviewers say strange stuff. Some said it's about technology in our lives. So how is that exactly? Is it because the leads use cell phones for instance?! Accordingly, every contemporary movie and TV show is about technology! Some say that this movie is a masterpiece. When a movie is understood only by its maker, then is it a masterpiece or self indulgence?! Long story short, these reviewers don't want to look stupid, so they blabber about anything serious, even if it was imaginary.Btw, some reviewers say that the performance of John David Washington is good. What performance then? There weren't characters to be played in the first place. In this case, how come that any actor got the chance to show acting muscles, since there wasn't a body for him?! So when Washington was saying: ""I'm the protagonist of this operation!"" it was the top of naivety and patheticness. For me, his face was mute just like the movie's drama; so if he's praised for that, I totally agree!Virtues: I liked the first conversation between the protagonist and the evil guy. The mere thought of making a thriller through an inverted world. And that's about it.So what's (Tenet) in conclusion? I can't say it is a video game. Video games have more heat and fun. Their target is about giving you entertainment, not headache. And mostly they aren't full of pedantry and recklessness. Honestly, (Tenet) is a heartless, mindless, senseless, and joyless movie. Was it Nolan's hastiness, or ego? At any rate, the aftermath is a stupid movie that thinks itself intelligent, and if you asked me, this is the worst kind at all.It's not ""style over narrative"" as much as ""style runs over narrative"", and the scary part is that it became a tenet in Hollywood lately.P.S: How dare you reference (Casablanca)? It was a great movie, back when things like story and humanity were alive!",Tenet

Action scenes are amazing, and keep you on the edge, and effects here are quite beyond spectacular. There are surprises here that not many critics will see comings.

The film manages to stay within its self-established parameters pertaining to time-travel but the requirement for 'inverted' people to wear oxygen masks or the threat of an annihilation event if you touched your inverted doppelganger make no sense and seem to be added simply for narrative or stylistic reasons (i.e. Visual hints). Emphasising style over substance, there is not much to the story (once the temporal tricks are discounted) but the cinematography and special effects are spectacular. Unfortunately, the sound quality was not up to the imagery - films with complicated story-lines, in which understanding what is going on can hinge on key dialogue, should take great care so ensure characters are clearly heard (director Christopher Nolen especially seems to like tough-guy growling and the menacing sotto voce). I enjoy time-travel yarns but I didn't find 'Tenet' to be as clever as 'Primer' (2004) or 'Timecrimes' (2007); however with a budget likely magnitudes greater than those minor films, it is much more entertaining viewing.",Tenet

This movie is a real head trip. It is an original story-not based on any previous material-that is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who directed Inception, the Dark Knight movies and Memento, just to name a few. John plays a C.I.A. agent that gets recruited by a mysterious new organization called Tenet. Robert is his new partner in this new spy club. Kenneth plays the villain that has some kind of precognitive powers that he uses to make himself a very successful bad guy. Elizabeth plays his abused wife and John decides to try to use her to get to Kenneth and stop him from destroying the world as we know it-like any good spy would do. There are scenes that are shown from different perspectives and you learn things about something that you saw in an earlier scene. I know that sounds a little weird but like I said earlier, this movie is a head trip and needs to be seen more than once in order to catch everything. In the movie, there is a term used a lot called 'Time Inversion' to explain the backwards and forwards jumping around in time concept. Tenet is also a palindrome-the same word backwards and forwards. If you like action/espionage movies with a little time traveling thrown in for good measure, then you should enjoy this one.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 30 minutes.

60,kevin_robbins,Not my favorite Nolan picture but still worth your time,8,23 May 2021,"Tenet (2020) is a movie my fiancée and I caught in theatres during the pandemic as soon as it came out. It was glorious to see in IMAX. The storyline focuses on a time cop of sorts whose agency uncovers a series of events that need to be stopped before World War III ensues. As he uses inner operatives to get close to the target it becomes hard to determine who the agent can trust and who he cant. This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento) and stars John David Washington (BlacKkKlansman), Robert Pattinson (Cosmopolis) and Clémence Poésy (In Bruges). This storyline is very intricate and almost every detail is important. It is definitely one of those movies as soon as it is over you feel you have to watch it again to glue together the details one more time. The acting was first rate and so was the team who put together their outfits. The fashion was outstanding. The depiction of the lifestyle of the really rich and famous was also well done. The acting scenes were as good as any movie you will ever see and felt a little ""James Bond"" like. I do think the premise at times was too smart and this may be a film that goes over a lot of peoples head and doesn't get the awards and recognition it deserves. Overall, not my favorite Nolan picture but still worth your time. I'd score this a solid 7.5-8/10.",Tenet
61,drqshadow-reviews,Ambitious Concept That Gets Bogged-Down in Explaining Itself,6,6 May 2021,"Another mind-bending original from Christopher Nolan, though at this point I'm beginning to wonder if he's grown too clever for his own good. In Tenet, we follow a befuddled special ops agent straight through the looking glass, into a shadowy world of nebulous time travel devices and unseen future acts of warfare. It's a heady trip, a deep dive into several cerebral sci-fi concepts and their influence upon the real world, and for that reason it demands our undivided attention for the full hundred-fifty minutes. No spacing out here, even during the big action sets, or you'll drown in deep waters. That level of insistence can feel grueling and sometimes frustrating, especially when so many essential conversations are spoken in low voices, with a variety of accents, while ominous music thunders and overwhelms the dialog.Where Inception was keen to give us a brief verbal overview and then make with the show-and-tell, Tenet laboriously explains most of its theoretical plot-knots. The wild payoffs are still worth the effort, particularly during the hectic, breathlessly inventive final act, but we've got to earn them. I'm not sure if that speaks to the filmmaker's lack of confidence in efficiently demonstrating the rules before toying with them, or his mistrust in the audience to put those pieces together by themselves. Either way, it's a mildly concerning turn and the indulgent wordiness hurts the story's flow. For every jaw-dropping ""whoah"" moment (and there are quite a few), we'll sit through two lingering expository sequences in a swanky office, luxurious hotel suite or private yacht deck. I suspect these may be less grating after multiple viewings, but at first blush, they're excessive and off-putting.A challenging collage of lofty ideas and wild mental gymnastics that's often very cool, but also too complex for an immediately satisfying explanation.",Tenet
62,GiraffeDoor,I feel like i've watched it forwards and back in one sitting...,6,28 September 2020,"Coming out of this there were so many logistical details I had questions about but never mind them. Other people will talk about them.OK, imagine Inception but more so. That's this movie. Even louder, even more convoluted, even more dense.I didn't hate this or anything, but it's a 150 minute movie I think and I feel that it would have worked a bit better at just 120. It's rather adorable to see Nolan try to recreate Inception (which was really just Paprika in muted colors anyway but I didn't mind it).Back to this movie though: was I the only one who was surprised by how little ""Tenet"" has to do with anything? From the trailers I thought it was all about some kind of shadowy government but it's actually about some kind of retrochronological mechanism.Never mind the plot or the characters. if you're focused on that you don't get the point of this movie. It's a fun action movie with plenty of neat effects, set pieces and general action movie badassdom even if there is maybe too much of...everything (except coherence). The protagonist has really no motivation beyond his job. He was assigned to the the role and now we're stuck with him.Kenneth Brannagh makes a delicious villain. I wasn't even sure it was him for the most part. Though i do wish they'd used an actual Russian. The only other really compelling character is Robert Pattinson's character. Why wasn't he the hero? He was so much more fun.I just let this movie wash over me and didn't question it and I suggest you don't either. Like, half the movie is talk and explanations which felt like twice as much as good story telling should have and yet there still feels like there was still half as much explanation as we needed (I worked on that line a lot...).Overall I feel like they were just throwing idea after idea and only stopped because they met a runtime limit.

63,alindsay-al,A Great Cinema Experience,8,26 August 2020,"So the day has finally come, 5 months after seeing my last film in the cinema, I have returned to watch the new blockbuster Tenet and here is my review for this film. The premise of the film sees a man have to travel the world in an effort to stop World War 3, but he is only armed with a word - Tenet and he has no idea what he is getting in to.Main Character
John David Washington plays The Protagonist here, no seriously that is his characters name. He is really great here, he gives a really strong performance, we follow this guy all over the world on a journey and you will care about him and really want to see him succeed. He has plenty of charisma here and swagger that you buy him as a leading man straight away and will see much more of him in the future.Supporting Characters
Robert Pattinson has had a good week, after the brilliant first trailer for The Batman and now his fantastic performance here. He has so much charisma too, the partnership with him and Washington is the real highlight of this film, they are great together and it is great to see two younger actors thriving in this large blockbuster. Elizabeth Debicki has a large role and I think this is the best I have seen her, her character has the real emotion here, you care about her and want to see her personal story resolved in a positive way. Kenneth Branagh plays the villain, and just like Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit he is playing a Russian and I do think his accent is pretty decent. He does a good job in coming across as the aggressive and intense bad guy and adds to this film very nicely. Himesh Patel and Aaron Taylor Johnson also do good jobs in there smaller roles.Story
Now this is the part of the review that will be really short as I knew pretty much nothing about the plot and that is the way you have to watch this movie. The story is really interesting in different ways that I will not get into, but the film is also really convoluted, most of it makes sense but it is sometimes a film that is quite hard to follow. I think this films plot will be better when you watch this film on its second watch-through.
Script
The character dialogue for the script is really well done. The relationships between them is handled well and you do care about the characters and the perils that they are put into. But some of the dialogue that explains the plot didn't really work for me, I mean there was never a part of the film where they dumb the plot down even a little bit and that can again make it hard follow.Style
The style of the film is fantastic, this is a film that was born to be watched on the cinema screen, don't watch this on a tablet or phone or even your TV, if you can go and appreciate it on the big screen. The action scenes are brilliant, they flow incredibly well and the unique story element allows them to get creative and add excitement. Also this film is 2 hours 30 mins long but I was never bored once, the pacing is great and even though this film is long and a tiring watch it is never dull or too slow.Overall
Overall, this is a great Christopher Nolan film, though I thought it was more in the Interstellar bracket of quality then Inception. However, I think on repeat viewings this film could be better and better, even raising the ranking higher so I would implore if you are a film fan and can, go and see this film and support the cinemas as it is worth a watch.",Tenet

When the concept works, as it does with Inception, the results are spectacular. When it doesn't, as it sadly does not with Tenet, the results are muddled and unsatisfying.As with all of Nolan's films, Tenet is visually impressive. His insistence on shooting on film and using location work, sets and practical f/x whenever possible, help to make these fantastical stories tactile. It's just too bad he wasn't able to present his concept more clearly (not dumb it down, but at least make it coherent) and that he chose to bludgeon us with an oppressive musical score that overwhelmed the material and left me feeling as if I'd just gone 12 rounds with a Casio keyboard.",Tenet

Pattinson is another strong character who shines in the movie and leaves an impression, Debicki with much more stronger character in second half was subtly perfect. Branagh and Kapadia are proven talent and they displays their talent with an ease.Climax of the movie is not like a grand finale kind of something but it's like matching the dots or picking up the very small clues that the genius director had been giving in the movie.Tenet is a movie with a complex plot and confusing screenplay but still have the charm to keep you glued to the screen with pure excitement and it wouldn't be wrong to call Tenet a modern day masterpiece.

INCEPTION was a mind bender. DUNKIRK was stellar. And now he presents TENET.TENET takes place in a science fiction world where we are introduced to a CIA agent known as the Protagonist (John David Washington). The opening segment involves an attack on an opera house where he leads a team trying to take out a team of terrorist who have taken it over and the people inside as hostages. During the battle a mysterious soldier ""un-fires"" a bullet intended for him leaving him spellbound. Captured by mercenaries he is taken in for an interrogation, swallows a cyanide pill and wakes to discover he has passed a test.He is now part of a top secret group known as Tenet. This organization has a group of scientists working to discover where a new weapon has come from, a bullet with an inverted entropy that allows it to travel back through time itself. Their belief is that the bullets are being made in the future and sent back in time. They want him to find out where they are coming from.Aided by another agent named Neil (Robert Pattinson), the pair track down a shipment of the bullets to Priya Singh (Dimple Kapadia). It turns out she too is part of Tenet and she purchased the bullets from a Russian arms dealer named Sator (Kenneth Branaugh). Learning that Sator is keeping his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) on hand via blackmail, the Protagonist approaches her to help him gain access to Sator.She does so and he takes on a job for Sator. But crosses and double crosses pop in and out of the mix here and it isn't long before the Protagonist isn't quite sure who he can and can't trust. The further down the spiral he goes the more he learns about the whole ability to travel in time. Locations that provide the means to do so, rules in place that must be followed and more find him going from place to place, time to time, to try and defeat the bad guy and his hoped for end result, the destruction of the world itself.As with INCEPTION Nolan has created an alternate world in which our characters are allowed to play. This is not some location that an innocent bystander will accidentally step into. It is a world where agents of both sides are trying to work towards a goal, one negative and one positive, and are willing to do anything to see that their side wins. That Nolan could take a story filled with so much to understand and have explained to us and get us involved in that tale is a work of art.There is a ton of action that unfolds here. As I watched the film it made me think of the classic Bond films we all grew up with. Perhaps updated to a different time with the whole concept of time travel included. But that level of action and set design here are comparable and it works well.This is the first film I have seen Washington in and he does a great job here both in his acting and action skills. While many talked of Idris Elba taking on the role of James Bond, Washington feels like he's already done that with this film. Perhaps minus the romancing of an appropriately named femme fatale. Branaugh comes prepared here turning in yet another solid performance. Debicki turns in a nice performance as well and deserves credit for it. And Pattinson proves he has more to offer than being a vampire for the rest of his life. He does a good job in his part here.Some will find it difficult to follow this film and fortunately that works well with it on disc. It allows you to pause the movie to discuss with the rest of those watching with you exactly what is going on. Or you can back it up and decipher it. In any event the movie is entertaining and thought provoking at the same time. For me that makes this one worth watching more than once.",Tenet

Inception was a has to watch 3 times to completely get it and yes in the end it was great, memento was just a 2 times but I got the jist from just 1, interstellar was again a 2 watch but tenet is almost unwatchable just once there's NO WAY you can get it all in 1 viewing and that sucks!! For 1 I dont like the theater as much as I used to so going once is enough so that makes it so i have to watch tenet in the theater THEN have to rent it or buy it so i can understand what the heck it's about. Skip this movie and go see the very underrated new mutants!!! Sorry nolan but enough is enough!!",Tenet
73,kluseba,Intellectually challenging but emotionally underwhelming,7,31 August 2020,"It's simply great to return to the cinema and watch a new movie for the first time in half a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to this, it's not just any movie but the new film by British cult director Christopher Nolan who has just celebrated his fiftieth birthday. As you might expect from his films, Tenet is visually stunning, profoundly philosophical and challengingly intellectual.On the positive side, the visual aspects of this science-fiction film are quite impressive. Especially the battle and car chase scenes are memorable and should be experienced at your local cinema and not on a streaming platform. The story comes around with a few surprises and multiple details that might take some time to sink in. Still, the plot never gets too complex or confusing. You need to stay fully focused for two and a half hours but you will get rewarded with a unique movie that walks off the beaten path. While the overall acting performances are overall average, Kenneth Branagh is absolutely stunning as unpredictable antagonist worthy of a classic movie of the James Bond franchise.Tenet is however not without a few flaws. While the story is quite intellectual, the emotional component is overall rather underwhelming. The protagonist is sympathetic but nothing more and the side characters are often lacking depth to a point when you stop caring about their fates. Instead of adding complex twists and turns to the story, the director should have developed the film's characters as only the antagonist can fully convince. The acting performances are overall unremarkable with the positive exception of Kenneth Branagh. John David Washington is at times lacking charisma and doesn't quite seem to fit the shoe of a blockbuster protagonist and Robert Pattinson doesn't exploit his full potential either and seems almost disconnected from his role as he seems to portray a careless youngster rather than a clever strategist.In the end, Tenet is an intellectually challenging science-fiction drama with stunning sound and visual effects. However, it isn't the masterpiece some people seem to suggest. If you haven't been watching any science-fiction movies recently, then you might be quite impressed but let me tell you that films like Freaks, Upgrade and The Witch are at least as great as and sometimes even better than Tenet.",Tenet

The storyline is average at best, way too confusing for it's own sake, but once you learn everything, it's far not as great as it hyped us.

We even get Michael Caine as a senior MI6 spook. But mainly we see The Protagonist (John David Washington) and his sidekick Neil (Robert Pattinson). Great portrayals of teams of agents moving backwards through time whist other teams move forward. At different times in the film we see some scenes from differing directions. Difficult to explain, you have to see it. Also munitions which move backwards throgh time, nasty if you get shot by them Elizabeth Debicki is Kat, Sator's estranged wife who has her own agenda for helping The Protagonist. Great battle scenes, (watch buildings reconstruct themselves!) car chases, again back and forward in time. I'll have to watch this again to fully understand it.

76,andrewchristianjr,ANOTHER MIND-BLOWING,8,17 December 2020,"I think I need a couple of extra viewing to make this puzzle really fit. Even if I don't fully understand everything, I cannot deny that Nolan is a master at creating a cinematic tour de force. Like a lot of his films the plot juggles issues of time travel and time continuum. Is that even possible? Who knows? It does make for a highly polished messy thriller. At moments time is moving forward and in reverse at the same time. This makes for a visual feast. Well done.",Tenet
77,TdSmth5,Brilliant,9,27 December 2020,"A raid on an opera house in Ukraine is about to take place. An unmarked truck is already waiting outside. When the police arrive two Americans in the truck spring to action, impersonate, and join the police. The police releases gas which puts all the audience to sleep. The Americans and perhaps the bad guys too are after a guy who has some device. The Americans of course get to it first. And manage to grab all the bombs that the bad guys put everywhere. Because they failed their supposed employer, they are tortured afterward and nearly killed.On of them, who later calls himself the protagonist, wakes up in an ocean wind turbine. His handler tells him that his next missions involved saving the world from World War III which won't be nuclear but something else. He tells him the secret password ""Tenet"" and shows him the illuminati Merkelian hand gesture which will open doors.Sure enough, thanks to it he goes to a research facility where they've stored reverse entropy items they've found recently. Such as bullets that fly from a wall into the gun. We actually saw that in action during the intro raid. And the device they recovered there has something to do with it. Research girl also tells him that with this technology the whole world is in danger because it looks like they are being attacked from the future. From the bullet's materials he concludes that they were made in India.So he's off to India where he is joined with a partner, Neil. They intend to meet India's biggest war lord who should be responsible for the reverse bullets. Once they meet him it turns out it's the wife who is running things and who also knows about Tenet. She tells him about Sator, a Russian who should be the one behind the bullets. His wife is an art dealer and through her he can access him.So he's off to England to meet a contact there who gives him a good fake Goya painting. That will give him access to the Sator's wife. She's held by force basically because she got involved with the painter who sold the Russian a fake painting for millions. She also has a son with the Russian and that also gives him power over her.He meets the woman, Kat. On the way Sator, tries to have his minions kill him. He and Kat become close so he tries to help get out from under Sator's yoke. To do that they have to steal the fake painting Sator keeps in a storage facility. This is interesting. The super rich keep storage units inside international airport terminals. Of course the facility itself is impregnable. So protagonist and Neil are joined by some more people. The plan is to crash a plane into the hangar next to the storage company to create a distraction which will activate the security systems and revert them back to something easy to crack. Everything works OK until they are attacked by some type of black ops guys running out of the storage. They do a cool fight backwards in time.Next protagonist meets the Sator who isn't interested in him until he mentions ""opera"" in reference to Ukraine. Sator puts him through some tests which he passes saving Sator's life in the process. The idea is for our group to sell Sator some plutonium and somehow get one of those weird encapsulated devices, both which they will have to steal from a transfer in Estonia. This is a thrilling mission. They will break into to armored car on the road. But again things get weird as cars showing up driving in reverse and people over the radio speaking backward. Sator is in one of them holding a gun to Kat's head forcing protagonist to throw him the device, but then yet another car in reverse shows up.So the handing over plutonium to Sator didn't work. They grab protagonist. On the other side of a mirror is Sator and Kat's been shot. Right there and then protagonist decides to go through one of Sator's turnstiles which allows him to move backward in time to a point before he shot her. The things is that Sator has terminal cancer and when he dies wants to destroy the world with his collection of encapsulates devices which he has stored in Russia. So our team is joined by Yves who runs special forces. As usual for a Nolan movie the plan to stop Sator is pretty elaborate. And involves two military units descending on Russia, one moving forward in time, the other simultaneously moving backward in a temporal pincer movement, where you basically encircle your enemy by flanking him on both sides, in this case, the past and the present. All the while Kat's aims to take Sator to the good old days of their relationship to bring her son to safety and then kill Sator, after our guys have secured the devices.Tenet is interesting and wild. Conceptually it's not that challenging, since the whole movie does this princer movement on the audience. And you can for the most part sit back go along the ride. And it's one spectacular trippy ride visually-speaking. It's of course better on DVD where you can pause, and rewind to understand some of the things that are said, and research if necessary. I do want to see it again, just to see how they handled the two time lapses.The problem is with the writing and the dialogue, which gives Mamet a run for his money. It's devoid of formalities, it's straight to the point, but it offers no access to the audience. Often though it's the times when nothing is said, despite what is happening. Occasionally protagonist has the important things repeated to him. But that doesn't change the fact that it's pretty awful to listen to. These character talk as if they knew what they're talking about even though they are facing something entirely new. That problem is also amplified in the ""acting."" Here and and in most movies these days, actors and actresses instead of acting human behavior are posing and modelling. Mainly a posture of super confidence. Which again, is ludicrous given that their lives are in danger thanks to bizarre and incomprehensible situations. Given what goes on, this movie takes itself way to seriously. Later in the movie, Yves offers much needed humor and common sense, warning repeatedly our main characters to avoid doing stupid things--to no avail of course. The dualism holds also in the casting. Branagh, Pattison, Kapadia, Taylor-Johnson are excellent. Washington and Debicki have no business being in this movie. But Nolan and co. have always struggled with creating a consistent strong cast. Sure Tenet, doesn't offer much of in terms of deep meaning like Interstellar or Predestination (a recommended movie along the lines of Tenet), but Tenet is high on thrills and action. Unusual for a Nolan movie, Tenet doesn't have some long scene that doesn't work. It all works well here and is worth watching.",Tenet
78,s3276169,"Shame they can't ""invert"" the script.....",3,29 November 2020,"I'm not going to mix my words when it comes to ""Tenet"", its horrible.The script is, in my opinion, an incoherent mess, with a story line that defies reason and logic. Of course there's no fixing this core failing, so the train wreck just grows bigger and uglier, as this rather tedious tale unfolds. Or is that ""infolds"".Acting is mostly reasonable but the bad Russian character, in particular, is a Western mainstream media cliche. A misogynistic boogeyman, who might just destroy the world. If you can't read between the lines there, then you might not have been watching the MSM's current take on Russia. Not that I would blame you.Sets are expensive and special effects are above average. That said, there's not a lot going on under the hood, so to speak, so that really doesn't fix this film in a meaningful way.In short, if this one leaves you feeling confused its not you, its the story or perhaps the overall absence of one.3/10 from me.",Tenet
79,Agent10,"Interesting to follow, fun to decipher.",9,17 November 2020,"There is a long tradition in regards to the new age of time perception. While we first saw what could possibly happen in a movie like Timecop, ever since Minority Report, we have seen smarter and denser depictions of time travel. Primer showed us how multiple realties can manipulate a time line. Time Crimes and Predestination expertly weaved events being manipulated by our future and past selves. The only problem these films had was the limits of a small budget, and that is when someone like Christopher Nolan comes in. With the pull he commands and a 200 million budget to work with, what we have is all of the best pieces of the previously mentioned films on steroids. And testosterone. And Human Growth Hormones. Hell he has enough chemicals to start a wrestling league.Now Tenet is not going to squash all of those films due to grandeur and scale, but instead will stand next to them as intriguing and incredible takes on how we visualize time and time travel. Nolan has the capability to bringing something new to the table without making it cheap or too dumbed down.Tenet starts with a pulse pounding action scene that is a loving devotion to espionage movies. From there, we see The Protagonist expertly maneuver through a world of intrigue, danger and back door deals. John David Washington has enough cool and physicality to fully encompass the role of The Protagonist, and why would he not? I mean Denzel Washington is his old man! So anyone worrying about a relative no name leading a massive movie like this doesn't need to worry. I actuallly enjoyed the casting choices, for Robert Pattinson played a very understated character and only Kenneth Branagh has a major role who could be considered a known actor besides Pattinson. And this does make me gush a little about Branagh's performance.Someone might say, why this pasty old guy? I will tell you why. Branagh brings rage and power to a role that needed it. We are not afraid of him physically, but we can be afraid of him due to his actions. He will get his hands dirty but that is what you pay henchmen for. It would have absolute pissed me off if he started doing Kung fu moves or had a fight where he was toe to toe with The Protagonist. Thankfully Nolan doesn't believe in such ridiculousness. Needless to say, I really liked the character and considered it a high point.I will say this, be prepared to get your mind warped the first time around. I did not write this review until I had seen it three times. I still have some questions but then again Nolan leaves these laurels to our own imagination without necessarily insulting the audience. But the final fight scene is interesting as hell and difficult to follow the first time, so yeah, watch it a couple more times.This will probably be Nolan's least accessible movie since Following, but will eventually be appreciated later on once the internet gets to dissect the film more thoroughly. Give this film a try. Not because it is the coolest movie in the theaters right now, but because it is just so darn cool to follow and look at.",Tenet
80,questl-18592,Tenets of Spy Filmmaking,8,5 January 2021,"Screw you 2020. Seriously. Go jump off a cliff into an endless abyss from which you can never escape. Tenet is a movie that deserved a huge theatrical release. I want IMAX, I want a massive screen, I want BWAAAAAMs I can feel reverberating in my chest. Yeah, technically that's all possible, but it wasn't for me which makes me sad. So, had to watch this on the home theatre, which is good and all but it's not the same.Anyhow, 2020 rants aside, Tenet is a pretty awesome movie. It's no masterpiece but it's pretty incredible all the same.The Good! I feel like this goes without saying anymore but WOW Nolan movies are pretty. The effects, the physics bending, the perception altering tricks and skills he employs here are truly sensational and feel reminiscent of when The Matrix first brought bullet-time to the masses. Nolan's temporal tomfoolery will likely be mimicked and copied again and again. This isn't exactly new for him, of course. Inception did the same thing upon it's release. Still, I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on it, the film is just breathtakingly shot, the effects and how they're employed is remarkably well done and really the main reason to see this and why I'm mad I couldn't see it on a huge screen. The mastery is still obvious though and this is definitely a movie to revisit because I just know there are little tidbits and Easter eggs all over this thing. Also, on the good note, the concept of this is wonderful, mind-bendy and definitely wrinkled my brain a couple of times.The Bad. I'll be one of many to say this but the sound mixing is not good here. I watched it at home, with subtitles on and I'm so glad I did because there's quite a bit of dialogue I would've missed if not for them. Obviously, you could just crank the volume up too if you wanted to hear them but again this is a Nolan movie and if you turn it up too loud your neighbors will probably file noise complaints against you. It's extra frustrating though when you consider all the exposition that's given (so much exposition) and without subtitles I feel like I would've missed a lot of it.The Ugly? The worst part of this whole experience to me was the lack of proper character development. It feels like Nolan got a little too held up in his concept and effects and forgot about making well rounded and complete characters. Washington's character feels pretty flat the whole way through and that's not a comment on Washington because I think he's exceptional and gave this his all but he just wasn't given a ton to work with, acting wise. Similarly, Pattinson was wonderful and captivating whenever he was on screen but that wasn't anywhere near as much as I had expected or wanted. This movie is so high in concept, big on effects and then it feels like the characters are all just there to facilitate the story and spectacle rather than being the central, driving force. This is most prevalent when I thin on Washington's interactions with the primary female character of the movie, a character he has some level of attachment to for... Some reason? It seems completely off to me and unearned but maybe I just need to watch it another dozen times.Final verdict is that this is an incredible spectacle of a movie that makes me yearn for the big screen even more. Once again, screw you 2020. But even without all the grandeur of the big screen, this was a very fun watch that not only wow'd visually but engaged mentally. It's the kind of movie that demands rewatching and I'll be happy to oblige it. If only we could've gotten more attention paid to character work this would've been an absolute home run of a film. Still recommend everyone check it out. It's worth a buy but, and I think this may be the first time I recommend this, get it on the highest definition possible and play it in the best setup you can muster. This movie is all about the effects so you may as well get the best you can.",Tenet
81,aidanratesmovies,A Breathtaking Masterpiece,10,1 September 2020,"Incredibly compelling, complex, and with a stellar cast and fantastic direction- Tenet may be a bit overwhelming for some viewers, but once you get the full view of the film Nolan has made, there is no doubt that you are truly watching a masterpiece. The film is lead with some fantastic performances. There is no doubt that John David Washington is great in his role, but the true standouts in the film are Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and most notably Kenneth Branagh in the role of Sator. The cinematography in this film is quite groundbreaking, and i'm sure will be nominated accordingly due to its sheer brilliance. As Nolan has done before with Dunkirk, the film is shot in IMAX, and there is no doubt that the brilliance behind the camera and seen on screen is absolutely outstanding. This is a very hard film to talk about, as I feel the film itself should be seen going in blind to provide for a better viewing. The plot in this film, although I won't necessarily get into specifics, can be quite hard to follow, and though the film does come full circle by the end, there is no doubt that you will be intrigued and wanting to watch it again for a better understanding. I love the look of this film, by providing a reality that is unsettling but also classy, and by providing a world that isn't only intriguing but incredibly well thought out. Every scene is so well done, that even if you don't enjoy the film, you can't help but admire it for its technical and thorough brilliance. It's score is excellent and unnerving, and its atmosphere is James Bond like, but done in an incredibly unique fashion. In the end, Tenet may be a challenging viewing for some. But if willing to give into the fact that, as the characters feel, you may not comprehend everything at first, Tenet will certainly be a breathtaking viewing experience for all.
My Rating: 10/10",Tenet
82,dierregi,Pretentious action movie,1,31 August 2020,"If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks.",Tenet

I had an immensely hard time decoding (it's encoded, right?) the story. It did not help that the dialog was at times unintelligable. It kind of put me in my place and made me frustrated too since obviously a lot of effort was put into this film.Christopher Nolan just may be too smart for his own good attempting to tell this story on film (I'm not sure it could be told on paper either).

Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Taylor Johnson are incredible as well and Kenneth Branagh is a terrifying villiain. The action sequences are phenomenal and the amount of stuff that is in camera is astonishing. Christopher Nolan's direction is superb and with Hoyte Van Hoytema as director of photography results in a reliably visually stunning film. The music by Ludwig Göransson is excellent.",Tenet
85,davidmvining,High Concept,7,19 January 2021,"There's high concept, and then there's Christopher Nolan's Tenet. It's really two movies in one. The first is a standard spy thriller full of twists and turns. The other is a high concept science fiction action epic that is designed to provide the audience a new action experience unlike they've seen before. The complexities of the first piled on top of the complexities of the second create a rather delirious overall experience that becomes hard to grasp as the audience struggles to keep up with details that get spewed in quick order (and, yes, in competition with the rest of the sound design). That being said, I feel like, after only a single viewing, that there's actually a good amount of fun to be had with this film, and that's not really what I see talked about a lot. It's such an effort for audiences to keep up that they largely can't let the ridiculous action spectacle play out without understanding every beat.So, The Protagonist (might as well just call him Hero Boy) gets caught up in an adventure with world ending implications against and with people who can move forward and then backwards in time. Called inversion, it's based on a technology not designed for generations into the future, but the war over its use is being fought today. He is a CIA operative who took his cyanide pill after being captured following an attack on a Ukrainian opera house where he was tasked with extracting an asset and a package. The cyanide pill didn't kill him, but it did get the CIA to cut him loose on a new mission to find Tenet. With newly acquired knowledge of inversion and the Indian source of the manufactured bullets that had been inverted, he goes from India to the UK to try and get an audience with Sator, a Russian oligarch who seems to be at the center of the mysterious inversion. To get to Sator, our hero must get close to his wife, and in order to do that he has to use knowledge of a fake Goya she appraised as real along with another fake Goya in his possession.This is a lot, and it's pretty typical of spy thriller stuff. It's odd that our hero gets the first steps laid out for him from someone he's never met before like M would give to Bond in an information dump about 30 minutes into the movie. I think most audiences would be okay with that, but then the science fiction stuff starts coming in, and it's hard to wrap your brain around. Nolan's offering us a new way of creating action scenes with moving parts that had always remained stationary, and it's all tied in with the larger plot. I do wonder if people would have been more accepting of the film if the actual plot had been more straightforward than twisty, limiting the intertwining elements. I imagine that Nolan plotted this all out on a white board in his home office and it makes perfect sense when you create a flow chart, but that's asking a lot of an audience. And, on top of that, the movie doesn't offer much beyond its plot.That being said, the joys of this film are within the complexities of its plot. Revisiting earlier beats from a new point of view with a different sense of understanding of objectives ends up being surprisingly fun. The movie never really treats any of these revisitations like twists of the plot, pretending that there was no way that the audience could figure it out. We're just shown the events as they unfold, and they end up feeling like fulfillments rather than twists. There's no dramatic moment as we learn the identity of the woman who jumped off Sator's yacht. There's no reveling in the information of who the Protagonist was fighting in the Freeport vaults. I think this matter of fact treatment of the movie's second half will make the second half play better on subsequent viewings. Nolan trusts his audience to not need a holding hand, even if we may to a certain extent.The fact that the movie's protagonist, played by John David Washington, doesn't feel like a character provides some of the film's thinness. The fullest character is Elizabeth Debicki's Kat, Sator's estranged wife. She has a specific motive, to free herself and her son from Sator's grasp which she cannot do at the beginning of the film but the protagonist ends up helping with. It almost feels like she should have been the main character, lost in this weird new world as much as the audience was and with a concrete thing that she wants that we can relate to. The protagonist ends up going through the plot because he must, and as a vehicle for this plot he's fine. However, it's a thin reed on which to grasp.Technically, the movie's as well made as you could imagine a Christopher Nolan production would be this late in his career. It looks fantastic and the trippy action scenes with opposing flows of time are just simply wonderful to look at. There's so much detail and so much going on that when we get to the final battle, the audience can feel confident that the controlled chaos is playing out coherently. The actual objectives may need some explaining, but the action to get to that MacGuffin does not. And there's the source of the movie's fun.No, this is not some deep exercise in the concept of time. Nolan uses time to create a new kind of action sequence, and he does that quite well. Everything else around that is thin but entertaining enough spy stuff. You may need a flow chart to figure out the details of the film, but I don't think you need one to enjoy what the movie has to offer.",Tenet
86,jadepietro,Time Heals Everything,5,23 September 2020,"GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually stunning but emotionally inert action thriller about time travel, done in by a loopy screenplay.JIM'S REVIEW: Let me hereby state that I was totally confused by the storytelling in Christopher Nolan's widely anticipated action thriller, Tenet. Dazzling in its many well choreographed action sequences and technical showmanship, the film is in need of major rewriting to calm its overly complicated plotting. (Research states that the writer/ director sent 5 years re-envisioning his concept. Perhaps Mr. Nolan should have travelled forward to make some sense of his time-jumping narrative.) The film proved to be a minor disappointment for this reviewer.Tenet starts off promisingly with a terrorist uprising at the Kiev Opera House which serves no real purpose other than to wow the audience with a slick opening and introduces the film's protagonist, ironically called The Protagionist throughout the film, the first of many conceits. He is played by a rather bland John David Washington. The actor plays his action hero character with aplomb, but his line delivery and emotional range is lacking in any time frame. He befriends Neil (a winning Robert Pattinson). I truly thought that these two actors should have traded parts, which would have greatly enhanced this movie.This all leads moviegoers to a secret organization named Tenet whose chief mission is to stop a Russian megalomaniac named Andrei Sator from world domination. This cardboard villain doesn't even enter the movie until about 45 minutes into the movie and he is played with some over-the-top gusto by Kenneth Branagh. Sator's menace would make Goldfinger blush. The Protagonist also meets and becomes enamored by Kat, Sator's abused wife. She is played by Elizabeth Debicki in a breakout performance, serving up an icy Grace Kelly sophisticated but seriously damaged vibe.From there, we go to chases and heists that involve time shifts and reversals. Scenes literally move forward and backwards simultaneously which is an very intriguing concept and well executed too. You see, time is being inverted by a MacGuffin called Turnstile and it's up to the good guys to retrieve it and save the world. (A MacGuffin is an object that triggers the plot, a term popularized by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1930's.)No one can accuse Mr. Nolan of dumbing down his movie; quite the opposite effect occurs in this overly intellectualized time travel epic. Characters can't speak mere dialog. Instead they converse in very long patches of expositions about quantum physics and parallel dimensions in order to keep the audience informed between the jaw-dropping action. As some characters quip throughout the movie, "" We live in a twilight world"", as if to justify the gapping lapses of plot entanglements all through Mr. Nolan's screenplay. This isn't so much a non-linear story. Rather, it's a non-story with many action set pieces that are strung together to fill up an hour or two. But the essential plot is still loose and loopy, although the visual images are transfixing.Foremost, the stunt work and CGI are truly remarkable, some of the best work ever filmed. Kudos also go out to the inventive cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema, a frequent collaborator with Mr. Nolan, Ludwig Göransson's tense-driven atonal score, and yeomanlike editing by Jennifer Lame. This film is sure to earn many awards for its technical brilliance and top-notch production values. Nolan's directing skills are bar none, it's his own writing that takes a hit.Tenet is an adrenaline rush of a movie...a visceral joyless ride brimming over with peril and action that unfortunately gets lost in its own ""twilight world"". In this upscale James Bond espionage wannabe film, one character astutely remarks, ""Don't try to understand it. Feel It."" That seems an apt advice in order to appreciate Tenet.",Tenet

Tonight's review is an interesting piece from the mind of the psychologically teasing Christopher Nolan ,the man who brought you Inception and Interstellar in their odd glory. Nolan's work is legendary on many levels as you know, standing out for its weird concepts, mind bending concepts/twists, and true dive into Sci-Fi genre themes. So after all the work up and a very interesting trailer, we finally get to see the work unfold. What's this reviewer's thoughts? Robbie K here to share his thoughts as we review:Movie: Tenet (2020)Director:
Christopher Nolan
Writer:
Christopher Nolan
Stars:
John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki
LIKES:Fantastic Acting
Rather Fast Pace
Clever use of technology
True Science Fiction Plot
Unique Ideas and Fight Sequences
Nets your Attention By Making You think
Good twists
The Visuals and Special EffectsDislikes:The Action Scenes Are A Bit Underwhelming At Times
The Muffled Voices At Time can a bit Troubling
The Jargon heavy descriptions are dense and boring at times
So Stacked Is It Fun?After a wonderful performance in BlackKKlansman, is it any surprise that Washington is able to take a role and run with it? The man works well to take the monotone presentation of The Protagonist and somehow adds layers to it that give him more depth. Around the intriguing mystery of the movie, the Protagonist has mystery behind him that allows for an intriguing performance to be delivered. Debicki as Kat does a wonderful job in her strong role, a complicated chess piece that goes through more emotional spectrum than anyone else in this film and does it so well to be believable engaging, and empowering without being in your face. Kenneth Branagh as the antagonist Andrei has the look, feel, and sinister method that I love to see in a villain, a prime example of Nolan's ability to develop a villain that really fits the title well. Yet the biggest surprise for me was Pattinson, as the former shiny vampire/heartthrob knocks this convoluted role out of the park, making a likeable, complex supporting role that I absolutely loved, and perhaps redeeming other roles I've seen him in.
Acting aside, the movie succeeds on many fronts for this reviewer, achieving the goal of being 150 minutes and not feeling that slow or drawn out (which other movies have failed for me.). Tenet's pace hits the ground running, but manages to balance stride and sprint parts to make a balanced presentation that gives enough details without falling asleep. As many reviews have said, there is a James Bond aesthetic mixed in with several other movies that made for a good use of clever tools that were not too far down the fiction path. It's by not over using the gadgets that the unique plot starts really coming out, allowing the story and concepts to take center stage while the action and stunts serve their purpose of supporting and adding excitement. The fight sequences are not overly flashy, and hold a unique air about them (well most of them do) that circle about the core concept and feel very at home with Nolan's focused theme, while at the same time showing off the technology this film uses so well. Other ideas that seem ridiculous, are somehow layered and fleshed out to stay on the pulse of reality while also not being too stale or boring that so many films fail at. What all this wraps up to is a strong Science Fiction plot, that dives away from fantasy and allows the unique atmosphere to thrive on and keep you hooked on the story that is presented. Tenet's brilliance is the engaging mystery, or in this case mysteries, that you are trying to solve, digging into the complicated world and trying to understand and guess the twists that Nolan has built into the plot. And most if not all of these twists are good... and again fit well into the physics of this bizarre spin on our world. True, I did guess much of them to some degree, but I was impressed at how well-integrated they are and not forced or wedged as some movies thrive in.
Yet the highlight of the movie for me outside of the writing is the technology that was executed super well. Cinematography wise it's beautifully detailed, multiangle, dynamic goodness that immerses you into the film. Computer graphic wise, it brings the Tenet spin to life beautifully in the form of combat sequences, property manipulation, and weird fights with great attention to detail that seldom crosses into fake territory. As for the sound and music, well the bullet sounds are in loud definition and not too out of the ordinary, but pay attention to the music during certain moments and you might be impressed by the audio cues that will help orient you to the maze this movie is.As you know with my reviews though, there are areas of improvement for me I would have loved to see improved if I could. While the action scenes fit very well in the scope of this world, to call this movie an action film is a bit of an understatement. Sure there are exciting parts, but some parts at the end lacked the flare or even aim that I like my thrillers to have. I can't say much to not ruin things, but the end fight has a lot of coordination, but there blind shooting at unseen enemies is not my idea of the perfect ending some say it is. I would have liked to see Nolan's concept with a little more finesse and excitement to help add that tension he did in inception and Dark Knight. Something that might have been due to my theater's speakers was the muffled voices. Nolan's direction for delivering a very jargon filled movie is sometimes quite muffled, almost like a sound bar without an equalizer that can't find the balance between dialogue and special effect scenes. For a movie where details and dialogue are important, I kind of would have liked to have some better voice editing, but again could just be me. As for the Jargon, it's a great way to explain what is going on, but there is a quote in the movie that states trying to understand it will only make things complicated and you have to accept it. A lot of the explanations are convoluted and help shape the world piece by piece, but there are times the technical heavy jargon's attempts get a little long winded, boring, and may make things worse in terms of the trying to understand the presentation. Many of those who don't want complex dialogue and lines are going to hate much of the writing in this film, and even those who enjoy some thought provoking lines may also find Nolan went a little deeper than many would enjoy. Which brings me to the biggest piece to analyze, is Tenet too complicated? He has teased my brain plenty of times in the past, but the level this film does may take it to the level only Sheldon Cooper would enjoy the most. Tenet's layers are deep, confusing, constantly changing, and requiring absolute focus to the movie to get it. Trying to figure out the order of events and all the connections your first go around might be frustrating, which succeeds in multiple viewings, but at the same time is not going to be the best for the casual goer.The Verdict:The wait was worth it for me and I can say that Nolan delivers the same bizarre, truly Sci-Fi themed tale that he is so good at delivering. It's thought provoking, unique, with a layered tale that takes the gimmick, incorporates it well, and keeps you hooked into the plot. So many special effects and sequences support the theme well, and I was impressed by the actors making the characters come to life in a spectacle that was refreshing to see. Yet, this monster film is going to have a lot of layers and if you have a short attention span or only want entertainment factors made famous by modern cinema, this film is not going to be for you. Some unbalanced sound effects, a heavy emphasis on jargon filled dialogue, and action scenes that need some tweaking to help get the full effect. However, it might be the convoluted nature of the film that could be its undoing, the attempt to mess with your mind taken a little too far that I think takes away from the story he has presented. Again, it will lead to multiple watches, but I think Nolan needed to take a step back and simplify things for this project to maintain the balance. Still I certainly enjoyed this film and I agree that it is a movie needed to be experienced in the theater for its presentation, story, and special effects.My scores are:Action/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 8.0",Tenet
90,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Tenet,6,5 September 2020,"""Hasn't happened yet"". Yeah it has. 2020's Tenet has finally hit movie theaters. Time to 'Mask Up', keep six feet, and avoid sitting next to seat-filling strangers.So OK, you got a wooden John David Washington (Denzel's son) in the lead. You got miscued sound editing that's only hindered by a bludgeoning soundtrack. You got a 150-minute running time that flows at a somewhat decent clip. Finally, you got the obligatory Michael Caine cameo that always plays opposite the main persona. Yeah Tenet is the flick that director Christopher Nolan was probably born to make. The question is, were we born to see it?Anyway, Tenet is an out of the box, scrambled spy thriller that might require multiple viewings. And that's even if you didn't enjoy it. Nolan working from his own clunky script, fashions his altered version of Back to the Future Part II except that everyone is occasionally walking and talking backwards.Action-packed yet overly mysterious and lacking in character background within the first hour, Tenet is Nolan at his most ambitious and/or most opaque. Too bad his storytelling sensibilities can't coincide with well, his stark ambition.As something about a secret agent who has to steal a case of plutonium which would adhere to the start of World War III, Tenet is an enigma wrapped inside a coffer wrapped inside a gimmickry bubble. The film is a human Zapruder because you have to rewind scenes in your head just to figure out what the heck is going on (hence the multiple viewings).Christopher Nolan as a helmer, isn't in the business of entertaining you. He wants to educate you, like an MIT professor who's bent on getting a darn Field's Medal. It's his world, his rules, and we're just sitting in the middle while sucking on it for $10 bucks a pop. I'm going with a rating of 2 and a half stars until I see Tenet again, ""tentatively"".",Tenet
91,justin-fencsak,One of the most confusing movies of the year.,3,12 January 2021,"This movie about time travel before World War III has a bad sound mix, confusing action, and a hard to follow plot make this movie unwatchable. I suggest you watch Inception as it is a far better movie. Tenet kinda reminds me of Interstellar where it dragged on for too long and i almost fell asleep at the theater.",Tenet
92,Easygoer10,"Very Good, However...",8,2 May 2021,"(May 2, 2021) I saw this film at the theater when it opened. I was harsh in my initial viewing, even though I'm glad Christopher Nolan went ahead with a theatrical showing during the Covid pandemic. I have since seen it again. It has all the hallmarks of Mr. Nolan's previous works. This film has absolutely superb visuals and the storytelling is great. Because of the complexity, it does require some explanation. However, there is too much verbal exposition. I also have a problem with Kenneth Branaugh cast as a Russian. He sounds like an old 1960's James Bond villain (which makes me laugh). Regardless, this is still a film well worth seeing. I highly encourage you view it twice.",Tenet
93,Rob_Taylor,If only I could reverse the time I spent watching this...,6,13 January 2021,"I'm becoming convinced that Chris Nolan is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is. Most of his movies have fatal flaws in them and are presented in such a way as to deliberately try to confuse the viewer as much as possible.Tenet does this admirably for what is, essentially, a very simple time-travel plot. In short... bad guy finds technology that will allow him to destroy the world and, being a bland, one-dimensional cardboard villain, he decides to do this because he is dying of a terminal illness and ""If he can't live, then no-one can"".
The hero (referred to by himself often as ""the protagonist"") sets out to stop this from happening.Simple, right? Well, of course, Nolan can't have simple when obscurely complex and needlessly convoluted will do instead. So our hero doesn't know he is to save the world at the outset, and only learns it much later on. Along the way he meets others who, it is later revealed, already know him and were, in fact, recruited by him in the future/past.But even this isn't enough for Nolan. His time-travel can't be the ordinary ""go forward and back in time"" like what those pesky normal directors might use. Oh no! He has to gussy it up with the notion that you can actually live backwards through time.So you get the confusing (and at times outright hilarious) scene of the hero and his buds going about their business backwards through time, which is displayed as them moving normally, while the world around them travels backwards.
Sometimes, as I mentioned, this is hysterically funny, especially in fight scenes. It is also a little disorienting, as initially (before you get what is going on) it seems like utter nonsense. Even when you've figured it out, it seems like a cheap trick.As I said, Nolan can't do anything without making it needlessly complex and unfortunately for him, it leaves a lot of his audience scratching their heads and wondering what the hell is going on.Now, there is more than enough exposition (even Nolan couldn't really manage to show-and-not-tell this one) for someone paying attention to figure out what is going on, but that is the problem. A lot of people are going to tune out while watching this. They will miss the cues and explanations and have not clue one about what is going on. And, if you don't know what is going on, this movie makes no sense at all.It's a shame, but the backwards time gimmick (it really is a gimmick) ruins the film for the sake of some clever cinematography. Conversely, without it, as I said above, all you are left with is a bog-standard time-travel, save-the-world story with no real surprises. A couple of twists here and there (which you will see coming) but other than that, nothing new.It was probably a blessing in disguise that the pandemic prevented more seeing this at the cinema. I can only imagine that its current rating would be a lot lower if it had achieved a mass audience.It is not terrible, by any means, but it demands more of its audience than they will get back in return. In other words, not rewarding of your time and effort.SUMMARY: A simple time-travel story given a coat of pretentious gloss by pointless camera trickery. Nothing special apart from the gimmicks, which do more harm than good. With this and Dunkirk, I'm starting to think Nolan is a spent force in cinema. Plenty of better time travel movies to fill your time with than this one. Not really worth your effort.",Tenet
94,pc95,Convoluted with Pseudo-Scientific Babble,5,16 December 2020,"Slick editing and good acting can't save what is too convoluted in the movie ""Tenet"". I've liked Christopher Nolan's other jig-saw movies, but this one is just too much for it's own good. About 2/3rds through my interest level waned. There's too much pseudo-scientific babble trying to explain the movie's own ""movie-verse"". Nolan had a similar problem during Inception, but that movie had more going for it. By the last 20 min tenet has fallen into bloat unfortunately. Done well, twists and turns can spice up a movie, but too much, a gimmick. This one becomes tedious and annoying. As a viewer it shouldn't be required to re-watch a movie to fully understand it all.",Tenet
95,vengeance20,Mass Confusion 101,1,28 August 2020,"Wow. Seriously, just came back from a viewing of this & can tell for 2 hours & 24 minutes I never understood a single bit of this film, that's how much of a mess it was. Hell I can't even explain the synopsis never mind what the film is about it's that bad.Typically this film has got good ratings! Pfft, paid reviewers at it again while the GP takes a back seat in the dark. The fake reviews get catapulted into the public eye while the GP ones only get seen here. Pathetic. How about explaining how the film was like it is? Why lie & say it was good when it wasn't. I can tell you now you'd have to be a Grade A tip top geniuses or have a Masters Degree in confusing plots of films to even understand a gist of this never mind the whole plot. How ANYONE can understand this tripe is beyond me.The plot makes no sense. It was like following a moving trains traveling in a Mobius infinity loop. It's simply impossible when there's is no obvious concise narrative as to what's what. What time they are, in what day it is etc. The plot was a mess & as if that wasn't bad enough you have the time travel crap mixed in, literally. There would be a scene where you were following the action then BAM! ""Something"" already happened & then the whole reversing of what already happened would occur then just fade off into nowhere, then later on you see the same scene this time from a different perspective where what happened is in forward motion & what was in forward motion would be in reverse in the background. Then when you'd see the scene from another perspective it turns out to be the same characters!? Eh!? I know it's suppose to be the alternate dimension but When? Where? How? & What? Even typing this out now makes my head ache with frustration!You'd understand (understand being a strongly stressed word in this case) the plot sort of then the rug would be pulled from beneath your feet when a ""This already happened"" scene would occur, cue more confusing time travel crap. Several scenes in the film would show ships, car going in reverse & it wouldn't be made clear what or when this was happening!The films dialogue was hard to get & understand. The muffled sound, over dramatic music & explosions didn't help. Like with the plot & narrative, the dialogue could've been more concise & easily translated to the audience.The characters were ok, the action was ok. But sadly the films confusing plot, muddle time travel scenes made it harder. This film really sucked hard & is typically overrated. Doesn't the writer & director understand that the film has to be made easy to follow? That's is the whole point in going to see a film correct? I've said it before & I'll say it again! MAKE THE FILM EASIER TO FOLLOW FOR CASUAL AUDIENCES! I mean seriously, not EVERYONE watching this film will be fans of your work! The films pacing & run time were ridiculous & only a secondary insult to injury problem with the film.Overall, DON'T waste you time with this crap. Take it from me a film goer who by the way notice beside him a group of lads laughing & raising their hands much like I did & thinking ""wtf"" every 5 minutes! The plot & narrative makes 0 sense. It's only muddier further with the time travel & plot points which frustrates you more with the film pacing & run time. By the time I got to 1 hour & 30 minutes, I gave up & the film felt like an absolute chore to watch from that point on! 1/10",Tenet
96,moviexclusive,"Big, bold and electrifying, 'Tenet' is Christopher Nolan's cocktail of James Bond with science-fiction, as confounding as it is astonishing",8,26 August 2020,"You won't find a more closely guarded yet eagerly anticipated movie this year than 'Tenet', described as writer-director Christopher Nolan's most ambitious yet. Little has been revealed about its plot, except that it has to do with a secret agent - known only in the movie as The Protagonist (John David Washington) - who is recruited by a shadowy Government organisation to prevent World War III from being wrought by time inversion.Time has always fascinated Nolan, right from his crime thriller 'Memento' from two decades ago, to his heist movie 'Inception' a decade ago, and even to his last World War II movie 'Dunkirk'. Here, Nolan goes even further than all his earlier films, suggesting that time can not only be reversed but also co-exist simultaneously between past and present, such that people can move backwards and forwards through time at the same time.It is an audacious proposition no doubt; but as straightforward as it might sound on paper, you'll know if you've seen any one of Nolan's previous works that it is a lot more complex in practice. True enough, we must admit that we found ourselves rather perplexed by its concepts, comprising algorithms, the Manhattan project and the grandfather paradox among others. Even with a generous amount of exposition delivered by Clémence Poésy, Michael Caine and Hindi legend Dimple Kapadia, we doubt anyone would be able to keep it with its multiple narrative loops at first viewing.That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining; indeed, even as you might end up befuddled, even frustrated, at its physics and logic, there's no denying that you'll be thoroughly hooked from the get-go by Nolan's James Bond-equivalent. Without naming his Protagonist, Nolan has fashioned a Bond-style espionage thriller, with some time-twisting science-fiction thrown in to up the stakes.Within its two-and-a-half hour runtime, 'Tenet' brings its audience on a dizzying globe-trotting adventure - beginning in Kiev with a terrorist attack on a packed opera house; to Mumbai to meet the enigmatic wife (Kapadia) of an arms dealer; to Oslo for a jaw-dropping raid on a vault on the airside of an airport; and to the Mediterranean coast where the film's villain Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) makes his home on board a luxurious yacht. It's as expansive as you can imagine, and that's not even counting the other stopover locations such as the cliffs of Italy's Amalfi Coast or the spare Nysted Wind Farm in Denmark.At least Washington has for company Robert Pattinson's intelligence officer Neil, who proves an invaluable ally in each one of his daring missions; the chemistry between Washington and Pattinson is understated, but their sheer charisma breathes humanity into the otherwise coolly calculated proceedings. Ditto for Elizabeth Debicki, as Andrei's estranged wife Kat; while it would have been all-too easy to paint her as a Bond girl, Nolan's writing gives her character more depth and purpose than you would expect, especially in relation to Branagh's effectively unsubtle villain.Yet more so than any of his other movies. 'Tenet' is propelled by its spectacular action set pieces, most of it done practically without the help of any CGI; among the most impressive include a freight plane that Neil's crew hijacks on the tarmac and crashes into one of the nearby cargo buildings, a freeway car chase with vehicles moving in both directions simultaneously, and a military-style invasion of a private underground complex with explosions happening in reverse. Like we said, even if you do not quite grasp the logic behind it, you can surely appreciate the tentpole artistry in applying 'temporal inversion' to the non-stop action.That almost singular focus on science and kinetics comes at the expense of emotion, and if that is one glaring flaw in 'Tenet', it is that it fails to develop its characters in any meaningful way. The closest one comes to appreciating any of the ensemble is Kat's longing to be reunited with her young son Max, part of the psychological abuse which she endures being in a joyless marriage with Andrei. Yet those looking for the sort of emotional anchor as that which Leonardo DiCaprio's character had with his wife in 'Inception' will come off sorely disappointed, because it isn't clear what Washington is driven by other than to prevent Armageddon.Certainly, those eagerly awaiting the sort of big-scale cinematic spectacle that Nolan is known for since 'The Dark Knight' trilogy will love every minute of 'Tenet'. His blockbuster has been touted as the reason to head back to the cinemas, and let's just say it fully lives up to that promise. What it demands in return is that you embrace its convoluted machinations, including time travel paradoxes, quantum physics and ""temporal pincer movements"" that feed into a palindromic narrative concept; even if you go 'WTF', know that it is part of the experience, an experience which Nolan warns through a character - ""Don't try to understand it, feel it.""",Tenet

98,nancyldraper,Fitness training for your little grey cells,9,29 August 2020,"The premise was a brilliant rethinking of a much covered SciFi trope. It was a spectacular exercise of the mind to unravel its mysteries. The filmmaking and sound track were innovatively executed. The only problem was I couldn't understand 50% of the dialogue, much of which was given through oxygen masks or under the noise of battle by an international cast with all the glory of their divergent English accents. In a film so rooted in complex intellectual constructs and subtle plot twists, it sure would have been nice to hear what they were saying. I'll look forward to seeing it again, for the first time, with subtitles. Although we were in a state of the art theatre, I discovered that one of the other four in the Auditorium was able to catch more of the dialogue from her seat at the elevated back of the hall.

101,Abdulxoxo,Convoluted plot but visually astonishing,7,4 December 2020,"While the ""inverted time"" or moving in reverse, concept is quite fascinating, the plot is very muddled and convoluted, and the music is so overbearing, that it overpowers the dialogue which is irritating and hard to follow what's going on, since the film depends mainly on expositions. The characters are under developed which makes it hard to care for them or what they do. With almost 2h30m run-time, the movie could've take its time and flesh out, at least the lead characters, and also explored the relationship between Neil and The Protagonist. It'd have given the film more grounded aspect, plus their interactions is simply the best part of the movie given how charismatic they are.
Technically, the film is near-perfect; cinematography is terrific; the camera work is spot on, the lighting, color effects, framing altogether contribute to the film's visual mood. The score is also excellent; it elevates the action sequences and overall gives the film a really great cinematic atmosphere, but it's so loud at times, and you might want to keep a pair for ear plugs beside you, just in case.Visually, it's both stylish and beautiful, The spectacular landscapes, collosal set pieces and props, and all, are vibrantly displayed.The performances are good; John D. Washington did a good job in lead role, Robert Pattison continues to prove he's such a wonderful actor, and to some extent, he outperform his co-star. Kenneth Branagh is very convincing in his role, and Elizabeth Debicki is arresting.
All in all, TeneT is visually impressive film, shot with great skill and vision, packed with action and convincing cast performances. Tho, it's the weakest work in Nolan's filmography.",Tenet
102,arungeorge13,It's the one and only sci-fi spectacle of 2020! [+73%],7,29 November 2020,"The Christopher Nolan brand is known for mostly two things: 1. Sci-fi action spectacles that blow your mind 2. Complex, layered storytelling with a host of characters. Does Tenet deliver on these two counts? Yes. Does it feel gratifying emotionally? Not quite.Right from the explosive start, Nolan takes us on an adrenaline-pumping ride that's filled with set-pieces you cannot see anywhere else, plenty of blink-and-miss dialogue that explains storyline intricacies, and a save-the-world plot that only gets better in the final hour. The performances in Tenet are fine; nothing too remarkable. There isn't one character (including the protagonist, played by John David Washington) that gets fully developed or delivers with wholesome intent. Robert Pattinson slips into the suave side-kick role with ease while Kenneth Branagh's Russian baddie (with a fake accent) feels like one of those lesser Bond-film villains. Elizabeth Debicki, the wonderful performer that she is, gets a character that's more like a plot-forwarding device. Dimple Kapadia impresses in the little screen-time allotted to her.In fact, all that character development probably happens in the film's timeline future that we don't get to see. Similar to his other sci-fi flicks, Nolan introduces concepts within his storytelling realm that further explain a character's decisions or actions (in this case, it's ""inversion""). Even though there were quite a few compellingly crafted set-pieces, it wasn't until the 90-minute mark or so that I felt fully invested in the story or the characters' destinies. Nonetheless, this has got to be one of his weaker scripts, with the concept and craft overwhelming the character sketches.By all means, Tenet warrants a viewing on the big screen (preferably in IMAX) to embrace the visual impact in all its glory (Hoyte van Hoytema is the one capturing it all on camera!). Ludwig Göransson's score, a blend of rapid percussion and rhythms, is one that imparts a sense of urgency to the proceedings. Though, at times, it drowns out bits of dialogue (especially if you aren't watching a subtitled version). Tenet would have certainly been a tough film to edit, given its complex visual structure, multi-dimensional plot, and detailed set-pieces. Jennifer Lame did a pretty good job at it, especially in the film's racier second half.While it's going to take a long time for another Nolan film to hit the screens, I'll rewatch Tenet but at a later point when I'd feel like studying its nuances in greater detail.",Tenet
103,saadgkhan,"High Octane, Ambitious and Confusing",7,23 August 2020,"Tenet - B+ (memorable)Another winner for Christopher Nolan as movie is ambitious with mind bending concept of time aversion. The movie kept you on edge of your seat even though the concept and motives of the protagonist are confusing and it needs lots of explanation than Interstellar or Inception.I reckon, people will dissect the concept in years to come as me myself have to watch multiple YouTube to understand the time aversion and time travel in it. Nonetheless, it is highly entertaining and has solid performances by John David Washington, Robert Pattison, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Debicki. This is all and all Nolan's show, the actors are part of his universe but doesn't steal the show. Elizabeth Debicki is the only humanised character to which you can relate to but others especially leads their motives and personalities are never fully explored. Matthew had his daughter in Interstellar and Leo had his wife but in Tenet we do not have anything emotional for the protagonist to cling on too so when the movie ends you feel nothing for character as his relationship with Elizabeth Debicki is nothing more than a saviour or a mission. Robert Pattison's Neil has the most interesting character but all covered in mystery. The connecting dots between Elizabeth Debicki's son Max and Neil makes him the hidden gem in Tenet.Highly recommended for people looking for original concept and tiered of sequels and remakes. I do wish movie was less confusing and took time to explain it's time aversion theory and people didn't have to go online to understand the concept.",Tenet

He just wasn't ""sexy"" and there was little opportunity to be ""sexy"".Robert Pattinson was as stiff as Pinocchio before the magic, a total ""ham"" and Elizabeth Debicki had the look but added little else.The music overwhelmed and was grossly intrusive.The action sequences dragged with the same tedious trick used over and over again.My overall feel is we had little story, little character development and we really didn't care whether the characters lived or died.

110,ketgup83,"Engrossing, Engaging And Yet Unsatisfying",8,5 December 2020,"From the maker of classic films like Memento, The Prestige, Batman series, Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan's latest James Bond meets the time-bending action thriller is the first Hollywood release ever since the lockdown prevented us from entering the theaters. Tenet has opened across India today. Will it be as enigmatic as Nolan's previous work ?Tenet tells the story of CIA agent (John David Washington) who gets exposed in a rescue operation at the opera house in Kyiv. He is quickly sent on a mission to prevent the World War III from occurring after passing some test (which is not explicitly explained). During the mission, he finds out process of inversion where a person or object can have its entropy reversed. As he investigates, he travels across the globe to meet people - Neil (Robert Pattinson) who supports him and Priya (Dimple Kapadia) who is arm dealer and gives him a clue about Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). He also meets Crosby (Michael Caine) who tells him about the abandoned city which is the crux of all the events.While half of the world had already seen the Christopher Nolan's mega event film, India will witness the much awaited action flick today in theaters. The reason I mentioned ""much-awaited"" since Nolan has set a huge fan base in India as his films have done very well. As a fan of his films, Tenet has some marvelous action scenes - the combat scene at the gallery and we get to witness the backward movement again after sometime, the car-chase on the highway is excellent as we witness one of the toppled car come back to its original form adequately supported by Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography which captures each and every frame beautifully and Ludwig Goransson's background score, which gives a feeling as if there was some issue with the audio background score but later settles for good (you will definitely miss Hans Zimmer though).Though the editing is sharp, the film's length definitely could have been cut with few unwanted scenes. Writing by Nolan is clever as he always uses the world of physics, mythology, flip between past, present and this time future events together. However, there is something missing as Tenet ends its high-dose climax sequence and the movie closes with a twist. I also felt the emotional touch was not there like Nolan present us in Inception (mind-blowing background score and plane scene) and Interstellar (when father finally meets his old daughter).Coming to the performances, John David Washington was passable as his expressions were same through out the film. Robert Pattinson did a fine job and was a delight to watch. I loved Dimple Kapadia as she confidently performed in probably her first international project. Kenneth Branagh as villain and Elizabeth Debicki, playing his wife, were good.Overall, Tenet is a solid attempt by the master Christopher Nolan. It definitely loses the bus but the concept, action scenes and thrilling fight sequences makes it up for a nice watch. Good 3.5/5",Tenet
111,Prashast_Singh,Enjoying it isn't difficult; piecing together the plot is.,10,4 December 2020,"How does one make a film no can easily spoil? Well, possibly by convoluting the plot, but it's something only original filmmakers can do. Tenet by Christopher Nolan is just that film. He successfully repeats the sci-fi action formula used in Inception (of mixing blockbuster action with a thought-inducing plot) and emerges successful in delivering the desired product, though the rather intended convolution can be indeed distracting.But as a character said: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" That's what I did. Try to think of it and I guess not even all the characters are possibly understanding what's going on around them, except it deals with time and involves plenty of physical challenges. With that, I found myself stopping to question everything I was watching and rather just get immersed into it. The nonstop action, which was also very well filmed and choreographed like any other Nolan actioner, is the real highlight and one of the reasons the convoluted plot doesn't turn out to be a negative.Since it worked for me that way, you can say Nolan made a right choice with the genre. By keeping it a pure action blockbuster at its core, he has prevented the film from possibly losing viewers to the at-times confusion inducing plot. One thing I can guarantee is that a single viewing isn't going to clear all your doubts. And that's both an intelligent commercial formula as well as an original, intriguing tactic on part of the makers.It has got great performances too, and you possibly know that already. Although the film is long, the focused plot and the constant action and suspense end up justifying it in the end. The score is good, even though it ends up making a good amount of the dialogue inaudible without subtitles. I watched it with subtitles, and still found the exposition hard to follow. But as mentioned before, the action worked big time. Not only because it was beautifully constructed, but also because of how it was placed: just at the time when you're starting to think too much.Tenet isn't a difficult film to enjoy, just a difficult one when the plot is pieced together. But with that, you get two choices once the credits have rolled: to re-watch it or just read explanations on the internet. Since this is an action film, I've got a good reason to re-watch it (although my primary choice would be to just watch the reverse action sequences), but I also can't deny the fact that one of the best things about the film was not understanding everything, just like we don't understand time in general. The makers, in my opinion, have now a good opportunity to also release a linear cut for people to follow it better (although I don't see it happening anytime soon).Just try to enjoy Tenet without trying to think too much (I know it'll be difficult, but still) while the film is still playing. The explosive action sequences are there to help you with it. Once it's over, go ahead and make any of the aforementioned choices: doing that alone will decide how better you understand TENET, a word that remains the same when spelled backwards.",Tenet
112,Jeremy_Urquhart,Another satisfying blockbuster from Christopher Nolan,8,23 August 2020,"Tenet is sure to be a film that's scrutinised, critiqued, over-analysed, and maybe even strongly disliked by some. When a movie gets hyped up like this, and so much of an emphasis is placed on its secrets, some people are sure to get disappointed. Of the disappointed, some are going to be very disappointed, and some might just be a little let down. That being said, these people might well be a vocal minority- I think Tenet does enough right, particularly in terms of its technical quality and spectacle, that most will enjoy it. Some may even find themselves loving it- it's hard to say for sure at this point.The plot is one I won't describe, as I went into this having somehow avoided every single trailer, and it added to my anticipation immensely. I wish I could avoid trailers for all movies going forward, especially for movies I already know I'll see. Somehow, I also avoided reviews, which is something I've never done before. I know there aren't a lot of reviews out there at the moment, but there were enough for me to maybe have some indication of whether or not the movie would deliver.Despite not knowing much about the plot, or even genre, there was still a great deal I was expecting, and in those departments, I was satisfied. I was hoping for a fast-paced, exciting, well-shot, and bombastically scored movie, and I pretty much got all of those things and then some. I think some people underestimate how difficult it is to pull off conceiving and then making a film of this size, and as such, we need to celebrate directors like Nolan, who play around with interesting, often ambitious ideas, but do so on a crazy scale, while also doing so in a way that appeals to wide audiences. Very few directors out there right now both can make movies like this, and will get given millions and millions of dollars to make something like this. That doesn't mean you have to like the movie of course, but I feel like it at least deserves a little respect.I don't think any actor in here gives their best performance ever or anything, but they're all solid. It's not really a movie ""about"" the acting, though the characters have a little more going on for them than the ones in Dunkirk, I can say that. John David Washington makes for a good lead, and Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki turn in solid supporting performances too. If there's anything close to a weak link, it might be Kenneth Branagh, who's occasionally a bit over-the-top, within a movie where no other actor really is. One other minor flaw with the film is a couple of quite glaring continuity errors in the film's first third: nothing major, but if I noticed a continuity error on just the first viewing, it's a pretty safe bet that others will too.I know I haven't said much to justify the fairly high rating I gave this, but I don't want to talk about the specific stuff I liked the most. I can say that it moves at a fantastic pace, never feeling overlong, even at two and a half hours. There are some fantastic set pieces, the action is all very satisfying, the score is great, and there are some very neat ideas that Nolan plays with, and develops further as the movie builds and builds to an exciting final half-hour.If you're in a relatively safe area of the world, and there are cinemas showing this, I can absolutely recommend seeing it on a big screen. It may lose something from being watched on a TV, so it is a shame it's being released at a time when some people need to stay indoors, but I guess that's just life at the moment.Tenet was the kind of big movie I didn't think I'd get to see this year, so I'm thankful for the opportunity to see it and experience it at the movies. There are nitpicks and things that don't fully add up, and things to overanalyse I'm sure, but for now, I'm just not interested in all honesty. There are too many other things in life that are slightly more pressing concerns at the moment.Like it if you like it, and don't like it if you didn't. Either way, Tenet's finally here, and hey, a potentially divisive movie starting a whole heap of conversations will always be better than a merely okay movie coming and going; becoming forgotten within the week.",Tenet

Tenet is intricately, exquisitely designed boasting some of the most spectacular, memorable set-pieces of Nolan's career. And as ever it's lovely to be in Nolan's hands, as he never dumbs down and trusts his audience.This film clearly revels in the futility of the plot. The central conceit is easy to follow, but the smaller details seem deliberately hard to track. With dialogue often delivered in whispers or from behind masks.

This is not properly shown and without mention of paradox. As me story plot is interesting but director and story writer failed to believe us in their theory. A viewer like me hardly will believe in such messy theory. Dimple Kapadia and Elizabeth Debicki have noticeable roles. Especially Elizabeth who has towering height and good looks with well acting.

115,blott2319-1,"Creative and exciting, but far from perfect",7,21 January 2021,"Tenet is the most Chris Nolan movie that Chris has ever Nolaned. From the timeline that jumps around more than a grasshopper, to the big bombastic action sequences (including loads of complex practical effects and ear-shattering music,) this movie is drowning with Nolan's trademarks. There's one thing I certainly cannot criticize about Tenet and that is the level of excitement and engagement. I was never even close to bored by the film, and could not handle any distractions for fear that I might miss something. As is typical with these high-concept Nolan movies, this is a film that will reward multiple viewings to try and piece together what exactly happened. I rejoice in the fact that there was enough thrilling action to keep me interested for those repeat viewings, although there are some repetitive elements to the story that might get old over time.What is most shocking about Tenet is, despite all its complexity, I feel like I could summarize the plot quite easily. It's a surprisingly simple story structure with obvious good guys and bad guys. They even do us the courtesy of abandoning any illusion that the main character is a real fleshed-out human being with a name, instead he is simply labeled ""the protagonist."" However, it's when you begin to examine the minutiae that you realize none of the story really makes any sense. It's like a pointillism painting: If you just stand back and take in the whole canvas, you can see a delightful picture; but if you look too closely at any one part of the canvas, you'll find a nonsensical arrangement of dots. I'm certain some of the confusing aspects can be explained with a whole lot of analysis and maybe a few complex diagrams, but that doesn't change the fact that there are some significant plot holes that will never make sense. These are the kind of things that will nag at me even after I've watched the movie again, and that's a problem.I have some other issues with Tenet that go beyond just the concept. For starters, it is a film that struggles a great deal with setup and payoff. There are some times when the setup is so obvious that I can't believe any film-maker still thinks the payoff will surprise audiences. There are a few times when there is something interesting set-up, but there is no real payoff for it. And, perhaps worst of all, there is at least one time that something is set up in a line that is delivered for no good reason simply to pay off 2 minutes later. I cringed more than once at all of these moments. In fact, there is a lot of clunky dialogue. There are too many scenes of people stopping everything for massive speeches that are lazily dropped in so the audience can try to keep up with the story. Tenet is far from a perfect film, but Nolan has made worse movies. He's having fun playing around with a new idea, and it works well enough to be entertaining.",Tenet
116,IonicBreezeMachine,Christopher Nolan falls victim to his own excess.,6,27 December 2020,"Following an extraction in Kiev, a CIA agent (John David Washington ) commits apparent suicide, as it turns out the pill the agent takes was a loyalty test for his recruitment into a clandestine organization called Tenet. The agent is briefed that the appearance items such as bullets, guns, and other objects that have been ""temporally inverted"" making them go backwards through time is believed by Tenet to be remnants of a third World War that will happen in the future that the agent is assigned to prevent, but as his investigation continues the revelations become more far reaching than he could've anticipated.Written and directed by Christopher Nolan who's proven himself with audiences time and time again with the likes of his Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and The Prestige, it's easy to see why Tenet was one of the most if not the most anticipated blockbuster of 2020. It's unfortunate that it doesn't live up to the standards of Nolan's previous films.The movie has an absolutely fantastic cast and all of them (for the most part) give good performances. John David Washington as the credited ""The Protagonist"" turns in a commanding performance and even adds a nice touch of humor to his performance that gives life to a very underwritten role. Robert Pattinson is similarly good as Neil, The Protagonist's handler and both Pattinson and Washington have great chemistry and bring life to even scenes of dry exposition. Elizabeth Debicki is also quite good as the wife of a Russian oligarch who serves as a reluctant asset for Tenet who's trapped in a loveless abusive marriage because she can't leave her son. Debicki brings to life the struggle of her character quite well and is very engaging. Kenneth Branagh as Andrei Sator is slightly more mixed, while not a bad performance by any stretch, it feels very much like his villain performance from Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit and certain aspects of his character feel like they aren't expanded upon as much as they should be.The movie's plot is aggressively convoluted. The movie is so heavy on plot and inner workings of temporal inversion that it's easy to get lost and lose the forest for the trees. Not only are there multiple parties with multiple agenda's as typical for the espionage genre, but there's also different sets of rules for temporal inversion that are inconsistently applied and are either over explained or not explained enough. The movie makes the mistake of substituting detail and plot for character and emotion. The fact that the main character is nameless leaves much of the proceedings lacking in impact or dramatic heft and an overdone climax involving one team moving forward in time while another moves backwards is so needlessly complex and overdone that it was hard to figure out who was doing what or why.The action sequences are okay for the most part. The opening opera house shootout is probably the best sequence in the movie because despite a lot of balls being juggled in the air, it keeps up the momentum and there's a clear objective as to what's going on. The rest of the action sequences aren't nearly as good. Either they're built upon flimsy logic such as a freeport set sequence halfway the movie that involves a plane that has very loose logic to put it mildly, or they're reliant on the gimmick of temporal inversion which isn't nearly as engaging a gimmick as Nolan seems to think it is. In many ways Tenet feels like it's set in the same universe as Inception, but completely misunderstands what made Inception work. The visuals in Tenet are visually unappealing as there's many scenes of industrial areas with a grim color pallete of predominantly rust, grey, and tan resulting in a dreary looking experience with very few visual flourishes. The central gimmick of Temporal Inversion is also underwhelming as the sequences where people, objects, and etc running or moving backwards loses its novelty rather quickly and there's really not much that can be done with the gimmick other than expanding it to bigger scales with the same general idea.Tenet isn't a bad movie, but it's a disappointing movie giving the level of talent and budget involved. The narrative is so convoluted and the world logic so inconstant that it's hard to get a handle on how the story moves from one beat to another, and the characters are so thinly developed that it's hard to get much emotional investment either. While the movie is grand in scope and has a few decent set pieces, it greatly misjudges the appeal and potential of its central gimmick and doesn't know how to establish a satisfying payoff. It's worth watching once for its scale and performances, but you won't get much beyond that.",Tenet

There is nothing to understand other than realise that Nolan is so far up his own anus that he can't actually see what he's directing.

I'm usually pretty good at unraveling a Christopher Nolan movie when I watch it for the first time. Not since Memento (2000), have I had such a difficult time piecing together the intertwining timelines. At least with Memento, I was aided by the black-and-white sections. In Tenet (2020), time moves in both directions in the same scene. Sure, this is a visually-stunning feat, but it's often a slap in the face of the Grandfather Paradox, which Tenet simply waves away with a shrug and a ""don't worry about it.""What's interesting is how moments of foreshadowing in this film triggered my ""lightbulb reflex"" each time the corresponding portion of the plot came into focus and gave me the ""aha moment."" I'm sure I'll pick up more of these when I watch it a second time. As it stands after a single viewing, my mind was exhausted by the end as I tried to keep track of everything that was happening. Sure, it helps when the movie revisits a few key scenes in forward and backward time (thus giving the audience more time to piece together everything).I think the main issue I had with this film was how it was trying so hard to sell the ""time travel"" concept within the standard action film framework. Why did the antagonist want to destroy the world? Narcissism, probably-which isn't that strong of a motivator in my book. I'm sure this would be the type of film Nolan would make if he tried his hand at the James Bond franchise. As it stands, I feel there are some logical plot holes that weaken the movie as a whole.

That a man who has been making movies for over two decades would think lines like the title quote are acceptable is staggering.But it's not just corny, cheesy lines that are the issue... a complicated (yet not complex) film, Tenet exists on almost 100% exposition. The cast deserved better, as the film, between car chases and gunfights, is basically two-and-a-half hours of John David Washington being told the plot.There are some good performances, with Kenneth Brannagh almost completely submerged in his character, but the characters are little more than ciphers to facilitate the plot. In this sense it's not dissimilar to Nolan's previous effort, Dunkirk, the technical side of things taking precedence over any real emotion or human psychology.In all honesty Nolan, once quite a talented filmmaker, had been going off the boil for some time. Whether it was Batman getting his spine punched back into place or Blade Runner's iconography being mined for the astonishingly overrated Inception, the wheels were clearly beginning to fall off.Tenet plays out like an Alice Through The Looking Glass for Top Gear fans, and despite multiple reviews on the IMDb suggesting it needs to be watched at least twice, many of the ""twists"" are ones that most viewers would see coming an inverse mile away.",Tenet
124,Anurag-Shetty,Blows your mind to smithereens!,10,5 December 2020,"Tenet tells the story of the Protagonist(John David Washington). With only one word, 'Tenet', to connect the dots, the Protagonist travels through a world of arms dealers & terrorists, to save the world from a potential third World War. This mission will take place, beyond the regular norms of time and space.Tenet is an awe-inspiring movie. It will leave you absolutely gobsmacked, from start to finish. You need to pay very close attention, to grasp & carefully understand the multitude of details & concepts explained to you, during the course of the film. Writer-director Christopher Nolan strikes gold, yet again! Tenet definitely warrants multiple viewings. The action set pieces are eye-popping. The inversion scenes are edge of the seat, non-stop action-packed thrill rides & they're the highlight of the movie. The background score by Ludwig Goransson is epic. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is breathtakingly beautiful. All the locales around the world, have been captured perfectly. John David Washington is spectacular as the Protagonist. Robert Pattinson is outstanding as Neil. Elizabeth Debicki is fantastic as Kat. Kenneth Branagh is unforgettable as Sator. Dimple Kapadia is brilliant as Priya. Himesh Patel is awesome as Mahir. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is superb as Ives. The supporting cast is great. Tenet is a must watch in theatres, preferably in IMAX. Go & feel the joy of watching movies on the big screen again, in the midst of this nightmarish pandemic. Can't wait to watch it again & again!",Tenet
125,bankofmarquis,Nolan's PhD Thesis on time,9,2 January 2021,"And...on the first day of 2021...the BankofMarquis viewed the best film of 2020.Christopher Nolan's TENET is dense, beautifully shot, confusing, wonderfully acted, well staged, mind bending...and brilliant.Starring John David Washington (Denzel's kid - more on him later), TENET is Christopher Nolan's ""Spy Movie"". Much like what he did with the Murder Mystery genre (MEMENTO), the Heist Genre (INCEPTION), the Sci-Fi flick (INTERSTELLAR) and the war picture (DUNKIRK), Nolan takes the Spy film and turns it upside by playing with the one thing we all take for granted - time.While all of these previous films were Nolan's ""warm up"" to this film, TENET is Nolan's PhD Thesis on playing with time - and the audience's expectations of how time works. Not only does Nolan play with moving people and action forward and backwards through time, he also plays scenes where you don't realize that the two folks talking are actually speaking at 2 different places in time.It is a mind-bender to be sure - and I cannot imagine what the filmmakers, stunt personnel and actors went through in making it - but there is one thing I can guarantee you - you will be confused for (at least) the first part of the film while you retrain your mind to forget all preconceived notions on how time works.But, if you are able to get your mind around this, Director Nolan has crafted a strong, well-acted, beautiful, exciting and action packed film that, in the end, is very satisfying.Let's start with the acting - top to bottom the performances are stellar. John David Washington (BLACK KkKLANSMAN) is ""The Protagonist"" (that is how he is billed, we never learn his name) and he is a charming and charismatic screen presence to experience this film with. Washington is a former professional football player and he uses this physicality throughout the film. But he is not a ""lumbering brute"". He is intelligent and thoughtful as he learns things and adapts his plans as the audience learns them and helps lead us through the often complex plot and concepts throughout.Elizabeth Debicki builds on her strong work in 2019's WIDOWS (if you haven't seen this film, check it out). Her character is much, much more than a ""Femme Fatale"" and goes mano-a-mano with the men in this film and more than holds her own. Nolan favorite Michael Caine (ALFIE) shows up as does Himesh Patel (INCEPTION), Dimple Kapadia (a major Bollywood star) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (KICKASS) - all 3 of them bring their ""A"" game to this film and supports the story very very well.Kenneth Branagh (TV's WALLANDER) shows that he still has his fastball - when he is interested - as the film's main villain. He has some very intense scenes where he just acts the pants off the others in the room (this is a compliment). Sir Kenneth has had a long, storied career (including many, many Shakespearean roles) and he plays the villain as a Shakespeare villain - and is very successful doing so. I'm glad he didn't waste his ""villain turn"" on a Marvel or James Bond flick - he saved it for the right film.Special notice should be made to the work of Robert Pattinson (TWILIGHT) - he has spent his ""post-Twilight"" years reinventing himself as a performer, mostly working in small, actor-led independent films, and this performance bears the fruits of those efforts. He is charming and mysterious as The Protagonist's partner and proves that he can, indeed, act.Like most Nolan films, the Cinematography is mesmerizing and beautiful to behld. Hats off to frequent Nolan Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who was able to create a mood and feeling of evil riding just under the surface of beauty - as well as to be able to distinguish those that are going forward in time versus those that are going backwards all while framing shots that are pictures of artistic beauty.Nolan did not work with frequent musical collaborator Hans Zimmer on this film. He stated he felt that this film needed a ""new, more modern"" sound and turned to Ludwig Goransson (the Disney+ series THE MANDALORIAN) and he was smart to do so. The music/sound of this film is another character and helps drive the story forward in so many ways.But make no mistake about it, this film is Nolan's baby - and it is very ""Nolan-y"". The action scenes are smartly put together, the plot and concepts are strong - but very dense - and the performances are strong. All trademarks of my favorite Director working today.This film is not for everyone. The complexities of the plot are going to be too much for some folks, but if you just ""roll with the flow"" when your mind can't quite catch up to the concepts, you will be rewarded with a very rich - very original - film experience. One that, I am sure, will become deeper and richer on the many, many re watches this film deserves.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Tenet
126,spookyrat1,A Self - Indulgent Cinematic Excess!,6,23 May 2021,"It was always likely to happen with Christopher Nolan given his past successes and his rather curious fetish with the concept of time, that he might just lose the plot completely and take things 2 or 3 bridges too far in a later movie project. Such a scenario has occurred with Tenet. I need to stress here, that I hate seeing $200 million budgeted films failing. But that's what's occurred with Tenet, despite the (albeit somewhat muted) critical acclaim and the 10/10 reviews you see liberally splashed around this forum. This is another tentpole blockbuster, that's commercially failed ... rather big time. Sure the influence of Covid 19 hasn't helped it win big audiences, but neither has its impenetrable storyline.Yes, as is usual with a Nolan production, it is visually sumptuous, fully deserving of its Academy Award for Visual Effects. Unfortunately, that's pretty much where the positives begin and end. When all is said and done, there can be little debating the point, that the most important aspect of film - making lies in the film - maker's ability to tell a story. Good luck with following the narrative of this film And like a lot of other movie fans, I had to laugh when I read Nolan's comments, about wanting his audience to see this film more than once. I'm sure commercial realities had no influence on his release of this advice (NOT).Let's start with the really obvious. A 150 minute film and Nolan can't even be bothered naming the lead character who is in most of the scenes? (Let's just refer to him as The Protagonist instead.) Similarly none of the major characters (and clearly none of the minor) have any back stories. They just emerge into this space/time celluloid experience, with the dominant one of course being The Protagonist. But really none of the players have any background details. I'm sure Nolan would say that was designed to make his ""big reveals"" at the end more impactful, but I can't and won't subscribe to that theory. The opposite of that are members of Nolan's acting alumni (e.g. Michael Caine and Martin Donovan) who dutifully turn up for their characters' cameos to possibly sketch out a little exposition. In the case of Donovan's cryptic intelligence boss, it's quite bizarre. He requests/reassigns/orders (Take your pick.) The Protagonist to Tenet, then drops him off at a oceanic windmill, where our star proceeds to climb some ladders for a few minutes, before he heads off somewhere else to get his first briefing on the inverted entropy mumbo - jumbo. On briefings/dialogue etc. Let me at this juncture just agree with many of the other reviewers here (even many Nolan advocates) who admit that again in a Nolan movie, much of the dialogue on the soundtrack is almost incomprehensible. It again gets overpowered by the soundtrack, or props, such as masks and helmets, the actors may be wearing. (Think Tom Hardy playing Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.) And believe me when I say there are lots of instances in this very long film, where a myriad of actors are adorned with impediments to clear vocal delivery.The acting itself is collectively pretty run of the mill, which you'd expect from a cast playing such lightly - sketched characters. Kenneth Branagh amuses us by playing exactly the same type of Russian oligarch, he played in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, complete with the same accent. Elizabeth Debicki as Katherine ""Kat"" Barton, couldn't help but catch my eye constantly, because of the way the willowy, 1.91 metre actor towers over her co - stars. Nice to see black actor John David Washington, lead the cast of this major production, but my honest appraisal is that he brought nothing special charisma - wise or emotively, to his unnamed lead part. I think you could have interchanged him, with second banana Robert Pattinson (the enigmatic Neil) and you'd still end up with the same sort of acting outcomes.What really struck me with Tenet is its lack of suspense. Yes, there are the wonderfully - staged set pieces we always get with a Nolan production, but punters are unlikely to be over - thrilled as they appear routine, in emerging from such a confusing context. This is only increased four fold when we start being delivered the mirror images and red and blue time streams during the second half of the film. This is why I have to laugh at Nolan's requests to consider seeing the movie more than once. Yeah, I probably will at some stage in the future, but no time soon. I just don't look forward to being bored again.",Tenet

128,joebloggscity,So will this sci-fi blockbuster save cinema? It's a fine start down that road...,7,31 August 2020,"First film I've seen in the cinema in over six months (due to the Covid lockdown), and it was a humble experience to be back and supporting smaller cinemas in the hope they can keep alive.However, the cinemas need some big films to bring back the audiences, and little better to attract the viewers than a Christopher Nolan film. What we have here is a pseudo-sequel you could say to Inception, and that is a lot to live up to.It's quite a convoluted plot with time travel, and so I won't even attempt to explain it as I may spoil it. You'll find plot holes etc, but I'll leave that to the YouTube reviewers for that analysis.Anyhow, I enjoyed it but it's no big classic. The direction, the pacing and acting is mostly superb BUT the plot is too confusing to understand first time. Maybe repeat viewing is needed. It has wonderful action scenes (Bond-like) and it all keeps in balance without the need to outdo each scene. Well done.The lead actor (John David Washington) is superb as the protagonist trying to stop ""the end of the world"" and is surprisingly wonderfully supported by Robert Pattinson. However, Kenneth Branagh is very cliched/weak as the antagonist in this film, and if anything he could be cringing. Elizabeth Debicki? Not yet been convinced of her in her roles to date, and if anything she has played a role no different to what I've seen her already do in other films.This film though will be one for 'geeks' who will pour over every detail, and a good cerebral film is great news for cinema.BUT will it save cinema? It is very much a step in the right direction. I'd definitely ask people to go watch it, to firstly enjoy the film and help support cinema.There's a long way to go to support cinema, but more like this will definitely keep them relevant & alive as part of our cultural heritage. Thanks Chris Nolan, this film is more important now than ever in this difficult environment.",Tenet

132,abisio,Another shallow hot air balloon from Nolan; see with subtitles or you will be lost,4,3 September 2020,"First of all let me explain why the movie has to be seen multiple times to understanding. Basically explosions, sound effects and music are too loud and makes it impossible to understand certain important dialogs.
Most of the ""explanations"" in the movie are not in images but in dialogs between characters so if you did not understand what they say the next scenes might not make any sense (and in fact some of the did even if you understood).
TENET has more whole plots than a strainer; and I am not talking about the time going back and forward but the story around that does not make sense at all.
People from the future contact somebody dying and offer them fame and fortune if he accept to destroy the world.
How secret services are aware about that ? If they have ALL the information why they do not act realistically instead of infiltrate a BLACK guy in a white world.
The obsession of Washington with Elizabeth Debicki's character makes no sense. No spy will destroy everything to save a woman considering the world is at stake.
Elizabeth Debicki is an acceptable actress but she has been playing the same character of a victimized woman who hate her criminal husband and has no way to going out. Perhaps she never heard about divorce lawyers; but in any case a woman targeting rich men, enjoy the good life and then trying to go out are not victims and I do not see ""LOVE"" in the picture.
Washington is decent actor but not enough to be the macho protagonist and carrying the movie. He has some good scenes, but is not Denzel nor Sean Connery. Idris Elba could have been perfect (besides everybody talks with British accent here, so why the main character not?).
Pattinson is very charismatic as the good guy and Branagh terrifying as the baddy. Both are really the best in the movie.
Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson is quite good in his very small part (his accent is difficult to understand anyway), but the guy has charisma.
Now from Nolan. I really never liked him as a director. He is able to get spectacular images (and very high production values), but his stories are overlong and very lazy written. If you search the essence of any of his movies, could have been shorter and far less expensive.
He has good commercial nose; he made success of DUNKIRK which was the worse war movie ever. He show a defeated army escaping after the one of the worse military error in history but keep making the soldiers feel guilty instead on focusing on the errors of the commanding offices who never set a foot in near the battle. So basically he tried to make a pro war movie out of failure.
In brief; the movie deserves four points for the spectacular images and scenarios and a few nice special effects; but overall is VERY CONFUSING ON PURPOSE and big explanations are NEVER in images; just in very difficult to hear dialogs",Tenet

Despite its complexity, the film is perfectly paced with its stunning cinematography and immersive score also hold up their weight alongside the driving narrative. The acting is great too.

136,kjproulx,A Great Film That Demands Multiple Viewings,8,28 August 2020,"In terms of fan favourites and just raw talent in general, director Christopher Nolan has been one of the best in Hollywood for many years. Every time he is working on a new project people immediately get excited. Being one of those people myself, I was eagerly awaiting his latest film, Tenet. Now playing in theatres in select areas of the world, Tenet is probably Nolan's most complex film to date. Normally, the complexities of his stories are what intrigues everyone and eventually have them loving it upon multiple viewings, but I believe he nearly went too far with this one. Tenet is a great example of top-notch filmmaking, but it's a lot to take in at times. Here are my overall thoughts.To even attempt to describe this plot in detail will leave people scratching their heads, so I'll simply say that this film follows a globetrotting main character (who is nameless throughout the entire film) who works his way through plots of espionage, all while learning and adapting to the new ways this world works. Playing with the reverse of time in real-time, Tenet is a very heavy movie to take in. There are scenes of expository dialogue that had me incredibly invested and understanding everything Christopher Nolan was going for, but others where I had more questions than any of his films in the past. This was absolutely a detriment to my overall experience, especially upon first viewing, but it also makes up for that in many more ways than one.The sheer spectacle, cinematography, and in-camera effects are truly what makes this film soar to its highest heights. It really was a true marvel to see how certain action sequences were moving both forward and backward in time. I'm not even sure how they pulled off some of the scenes that they did. Although the complexities took me out of it a little, I was still blown away watching many of the scenes unfold. If only the movie as a whole was even slightly clearer, I might have said I loved it. That said, it's also the kind of movie that I can see myself loving in a year from now if many more viewings assist in my enjoyment.It goes without saying that a Christopher Nolan film will make you think very hard about what you're watching and at least be enjoyable to a fault. For that reason, I wasn't surprised at all that I liked this film. I was more looking at everything else in the film. From the very good central performance by John David Washington to the always welcome screen-characters by Robert Pattinson, this cast is littered with talent in front of the camera. It was also nice to see Nolan switch up his composer from Hans Zimmer to the likes of Ludwig Göransson. I thought his work here was very inspired and became a character in its own right as the film progressed.In the end, Tenet is a visual masterpiece that did leave a bit to be desired by the time it reached its conclusion. I was both blown away and puzzled throughout the majority of it, which is why I find it very hard to recommend. It's a very, very well-made film that I absolutely think filmgoers should seek out whenever they can, but be prepared to watch it more than once as well. This is a movie that requires a lot of your time and a lot of your attention in order to win you over. I'm very pleased with the final result, but also scratching my head a day later after watching it. Tenet is a great film that I'm still trying to grasp.",Tenet
137,kuarinofu,"Bravo, Nolan has pushed his idea of non-linear film by cleverly pushing non-linear understanding of time",7,30 August 2020,"While some elements of the film were rushed and out of place and the action was confusing to follow most of the time, the ideas the film was trying to establish worked great for me. The ending was emotionally captivating and though the structure of the film spoiled its own ending, the cleverly played around that and suggested that the end of the film is not the end of the story, only a part of a greater loop, the ending of which might change the perception of our protagonist in the real end of it.This is pretty much all that I can give without spoilers, the story feels complicated when you are watching the film, so confusion is a part of the emotional gamma the viewer will be subjected to. I will surely watch it again, and I want to thank Nolan and the team behind this great film.",Tenet
138,Neptune165,"This movie felt like, me trying to understand mathematics",6,11 February 2021,"This movie was so terrible in every way, for every reason, in the present, past and future n forward and reverse. I didn't think this movie was good. I understood it, but the way they chose not to explain anything and moved so quickly made it seem like they were intentionally trying to be confusing in order to be cool. None of the characters in this movie had any interesting motivations, goals, or personalities. I don't see why Nolan can't find someone to give his characters any life? They're all so, so dull. Sator wanting to kill himself, ending the world, didn't make sense to me. No idea what the point of going to India was? And who the woman was. An arms dealer? I just watched this and all I got was he was saving the end of the world that already happened from happening again, then went further back in time to the point in the film before knowing any of this? Surely an unbalance in the time spectrum and all that would cause literal chaos? I don't know what happened for most of the film and I've seen plenty time travel. The director fails to explain the movie in a reasonable way. The action scenes are average, the fights are not convincing at all. The casting is really bad, it's one of the main issues with the movie. You do not buy the protagonist as a tough guy. Sometimes he is even insecure. Too much stuff happening in a short period of time, like easily breaching a lot of ""impossible"" ´places. The first time you watch the movie, you have the sensation that the ""reverse power"" is useless. This movie can not be compared in any way, shape or form to Inception. Inception is an excellent movie, well explained, amazing special effects, good pacing, casting and etc. Tenet is just bad. This movie was annoying, impossible follow, and I hate it. Who's the bad guys, who are the good guys? It's more complicated than Inception but it's not as impressive or entertaining. Most confusing move ever. Didn't care about the characters, nor what happened to the world they were in. I couldn't get into it where I couldn't even get through the movie. English accents were hard to pick up at times, couldn't understand what they were saying. The soundtrack was absolutely horrible, more loud noise than music. It was also very unnatural to see everything backwards. The plot was to ridiculous, to make me even care what was going to happen. Loved Inception, very frustrating film. the dialogue is terrible, can't hear the actors, the characters just talk talk talk exposition non stop during the first half. The action scenes where boring, including the hall fight and the plane crash. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story. It was just so boring and way too long. The beginning really is so fast its impossible to follow at first, tons of different things happening, new characters introduced every five minutes, constantly switching locations and all that while you're figuring out how inversion on screen works. Found it funny when movie tells you don't even try to understand it.",Tenet

142,msbreviews,TENET is the summer blockbuster we all deserve!,8,27 August 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Christopher Nolan has delivered some of my favorite movies of the century. All the way from Memento to the most recent Dunkirk, I've yet to dislike one of his films, so expectations are always high with him. The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called ""cinematic experience"", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.Nowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I'm not surprised that the ""savior of cinema"" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn't have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it's intended to hype its own movie, so I don't really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, ""savior of cinema"" doesn't mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It's just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It's a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there's a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.I'll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.Nolan said that Tenet would be ""the hardest movie to cut"" for any editor. Jennifer Lame's editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It's relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She's incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I'll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig Göransson's score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.Finally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it's indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It's probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that's only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.Story-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn't mean that it isn't a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I'm not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it's a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can't have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.The need to be vague about plot details doesn't let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that's one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there's an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It's a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it's almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.This last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what's happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character's circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled ""Action!"", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled ""Cut!"". Washington isn't exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn't help him through these moments.However, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn't avoid the ""humorless"" review headlines, and being totally honest, it's surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it's through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington's character traits.On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that's what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he's ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called ""blockbuster of the summer"" that everyone deserves this year.All in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema's riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame's seamless editing, passing through Ludwig Göransson's powerful score and Nathan Crowley's beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn't help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn't the ""savior of cinema"" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone's been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.Rating: A-",Tenet

144,SoumikBanerjee25,C. Nolan could do far better!,6,9 December 2020,"""Tenet"" indubitably deals with a compelling concept. Dwelling in Time Reversal & Paradox theories; This will surely be an enticing yet too difficult of a watch. Reason? Some considerable issues plaguing the overall implementation!
As an ardent follower of Nolan's ventures over the years, I must assert, ""Tenet"" is definitely not the strongest he delivered till date! If I draw comparisons with Inception, Interstellar; this one fall behind in terms of presentation! While I sincerely laud Nolan's righteousness in trying different subject matters with utmost responsibility; I couldn't help but point out their conspicuous drawbacks!Keeping aside the negatives for a minute, shall we praise how technically well made this film is.
Mr. Nolan has always been aberrant in regards to the technical side of his works. Visually its a stunner with van Hoytema's customary touch in adequate detailings. Few scenes are Choreographed adhering to Inverted Time theory! They look grotesque to say the least. Soundscore being surprisingly one of the focal points in here! A glaring absence of Hans Zimmer is tellingly filled by Ludwig Göransson; who has done a terrific work, no complaints whatsoever.Performances are decent, yet nothing compare to what we already witnessed in Nolan's erstwhile projects. Characters lack depth, emotions; needlessly to say very unlikely of typical Nolan! Therefore, I was unable to root for anybody. For a Espionage thriller; it was imperative to do so. Screenplay is tedious, with inscrutable transitions taking place oftentimes; ultimately adding up to our destitute interpretations.The intellection is undeniably purposeful but a vague elaboration on the same; sticks out like a sore thumb.",Tenet
145,mahmus,"Impressive set pieces and ambitious concept, but bland characters and boring story",6,12 December 2020,"The first half is really boring. Full of expostion and very little inverting.The second half is much better, but unfortunately, the story throughout the whole movie is extremely uninteresting, the characters are boring and the villain is just a striaght up cartoon. And I know it's because of IMAX, but the changing aspect ratio annoys me.The inverted action scenes are awesome, but I had no emotional investment in this movie, though I did enjoy it purely based on its action.""Don't try to understand it.

146,0w0,"It's a fantastic display of cinematography, but not a fantastic film...",8,2 December 2020,"Inception was fantastic and Interstellar was fantastic as well, in terms of cinematography, but also in terms of being fantastic films... Tenet however isn't a fantastic film, it's just a good one.For the vast majority of the film, the viewer is left confused and confuzzled. The start is confusing, the end is confusing, and most of everything in-between is confusing too... It's just a very confusing film. With that being said, it's a very visually impressive film (like almost all of Nolan's films). The sequences that feature the 'Tenet mechanic' are very impressive and without it the film would barely be a 7/10 film.Throughout the film, there are supposed 'curve balls' or 'plot twists' that are thrown at the viewer, but I managed to predict at least 4 of them, which really blunted any of the 'surprise' that the film makers intended on inflicting upon the viewer. This doesn't really come down to the viewer being 'smart', it just comes down to the film makers not being smart enough.Overall it's a good action film: Lots of fighting and lots of explosions. It's not anywhere close as being as good as Inception or Interstellar, but it's still pretty good. 8/10, and would even warrant a 2nd viewing since you probably would be less-confused on the 2nd viewing and thus things would make more sense.",Tenet
147,RussHog,Mind Bending Time Travel Noir Thriller,9,2 November 2020,This is the first movie I saw in a movie theater in seven months. I loved it. Nolan's best film since Inception. It is about a guy who tries to stop the world from being destroyed by a time bending device. This film has battles where characters move forward and backwards in time at the same time. The cast is great. The action is awesome. The plot is very hard to follow. This is a nearly three hour long movie but I was never once bored. It's not a film with a lot of deep character development but it never pretends that it is. It's just a super unique crazy bold cinematic experience.,Tenet
148,MrDHWong,Yet again proves that Christopher Nolan is one of the best modern filmmakers,9,27 August 2020,"Tenet is a sci-fi spy film written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, it yet again proves that Nolan is one of the best modern filmmakers and that the craft of his work should never be overlooked.In Kiev, Ukraine, the unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington) is working undercover for the CIA to help pull off a heist to steal a mysterious object from the Russians. When the Russians catch wind of him being a double agent, the Protagonist is tortured but manages to take a suicide pill before he reveals any classified information. Some time later, the Protagonist wakes up discovering that the pill was fake and that he has now been recruited to do a job for a secret organisation, who provide him with the codeword ""Tenet"" and a new technology not yet known to the general public.There's a reason someone like Christopher Nolan is held in such high regard by many cinemagoers - he is part of a dying breed of mainstream filmmaker whose unique view of the world around him has brought us a plethora of fascinating, memorable, and often surreal movies that have endured pop culture for several years. With ""Tenet"", Nolan has once again challenged the audience's perception of the way they may see things, in this instance, time in motion. Right from the get-go, we are thrust into the bizarre reality of our Protagonist as he tries to come to terms with this strange time-related technology that only a limited amount of people know how to use properly. He is just as confused as we are, and that makes him all the more suitable in having him guide us through what would otherwise be a complicated and convoluted story. Of course, like Nolan's 2010 film ""Inception"", it is required that we pay attention to every intricate detail in order to fully understand everything that is happening and this includes every action, every reaction, and every line of dialogue. Naturally, this will prove off-putting and frustrating to some viewers, especially newcomers, but I believe anyone who has been following Nolan's work for as long as I have should have little to no trouble.As to be expected, Nolan doesn't hold back on the action scenes and large scale setpieces. In spite the film's long runtime of 150 minutes, it never felt like there was any filler or padding. Every bullet fired and every big explosion served a purpose, not merely being there for entertainment but also to advance the story forward. It is difficult for me to go into detail about what action scenes stood out to me the most without spoiling the entire story so in the spirit of this film, I will use a codeword to signify what my favourite part was - ""airport"". The brilliant use of editing and the lack of CGI during ""airport"", the latter of which Nolan has gone on record saying he strongly dislikes putting into his films, is up there with the likes of The Joker's truck flipping over in ""The Dark Knight"" in terms of how visceral it felt. This is further proof of how far a filmmaker like Nolan will go to entertain his audience and how much he values our time as a consumer, unlike others who are all about show and no substance.As previously seen in 2018's ""BlacKkKlansman"", John David Washington is more than capable of holding his ground as a leading man, even in the shadow of his famous father. Washington plays his role not simply as a man with a gun shooting at bad guys but that of someone constantly questioning his own reality and whether he has picked the right side or not. His interactions with the other characters made for some great conversations about existential topics like how we are responsible for our own destiny and what the future could hold for us if we keep going down the same path we are already on. Robert Pattinson also gave a nice complimentary performance to that of Washington's, bringing something of a nice balance to any moments of tension the movie may throw at us. The friendly chemistry between these two actors makes me hope that the two will work together again in a future project.After eleven films and three decades in the business, it seems like Christopher Nolan's knack for telling original stories and offering commentary on life itself is in no danger of waning. Like ""Inception"" before it, ""Tenet"" seems like it will be the talking point of many conversations about one's perception of time and reality for several years to come. Of course, there will be the usual detractors who label this as ""pretentious"" or ""boring"", but that is to be expected of someone as bold and daring as Nolan, who isn't afraid to try new things. How long until we can expect to see Nolan's next epic? At this point, I can only wait patiently in great anticipation.I rate it a solid 9/10",Tenet
149,eva3si0n,Perhaps Tenet is the weakest film in Nolan's career,7,31 December 2020,"Perhaps Tenet is the weakest film in Nolan's career. He looks great in the trailer, and is no longer so intricate after 20 minutes of viewing. Yes, the denouement is excellent, the camera work is done at an unrealistic level. But there really is no plot here, the cast is not the strongest, perhaps only Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh stands out. I expected something more, apparently Nolan raised the bar too much. If you compare Tenet with that Inception, then complete degradation in all aspects is on the face.",Tenet
150,Alexander_Blanchett,Memento meets Inception,8,28 August 2020,"I am still a bit sceptical about this film. Well first of all its a great effort for all the creative minds involved with it. Its stunning to look at, excellently written and very well directed. The acting is very good and it is absolutely memorable. But one thing bothers me is that the film tries to be too clever for its own good and I think its prime reason to exist is to confuse. Now, movie puzzles like this are my speciality and I love them, and even after solving this I can't share the same enthusiasm about it as many others. I figured it out ( well I think) but its conclusion and ""cleverness"" doesnt really excite me on the same level. And this comes from a major Christopher Nolan fan. Maybe multiple viewings help - at least thats what I keep reading. Nolan invented his own physics here and I adore the creativity about it. So yes, I do like this movie but did not love it as much as I expected or as many others do.
The acting is great. John David Washington really makes sure Denzel's talent will live on in the future generations. He really nailed the role and played it like an absolute pro. Kudos for this casting clue. I also liked Robert Pattinson. I really like him more and more and I am so happy his crappy ""Twilight"" days are gone. He nailed Neil from the bones... and added a lot to the character. Elizabeth Debicki was also good and had many great moments. I really liked Kenneth Branagh although he overdid it from time to time but he was menacing and unpredictable in this role which I loved. One of his better performances in the recent years. Michael Caine had a glorified cameo which is always enjoyable in a Nolan film and already a nice trademark. The score was fantastic, although often felt Ludwig Göransson tried to copy Hans Zimmer. Brilliant cinematography and action scenes. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the weird Scene-to-scene editing. It often takes you out in the middle of the action and puts you into a totally new scenery. Oh well not Nolan's greatest diretctional effort but a must see of the year for sure.",Tenet
151,TheTruthofItIs,"Tenet: so much potential, so little realized",3,1 January 2021,"Tenet is one of those films that comes along every ten years or so that aspires to greatness but fails in its confusingly convoluted execution. Is Chris Nolan, writer and director, more intelligent, more clever than his audience? Maybe, but it's his job as director to make his point, his story accessible to his audience. Does he thrill that he published a film that flies over everyone's head? That would be the ultimate in narcissistic egomania. I've heard of people, reviewers re-watching this film a dozen times, but I'm not doing that, none should have to do that just to understand it! I'd say I'd watch again but at its core it just wasn't that interesting or enjoyable, the actors weren't appealing, their performances were tepid, zero humor or comedy relief, etc. It's ashame that it's just a disappointing C- experience when it had the potential to be an A+.

153,cardsrock,Nolan is the undisputed king of high-concept blockbusters,9,1 September 2020,"What a film to welcome audiences back to cinemas. If you thought Inception or Interstellar were headscratchers, what til you get a load of Tenet. This is probably the most complex film I've ever seen. Christopher Nolan has recently become fixated on the concept of time and he takes his passion to mind-bending new heights in this film.The plot is, let's say, complicated. There's a whole lot going on that takes time to grasp. It will definitely take another watch to fully untangle, even with picking up on some of Nolan's classic subtleties.Simply put, the visuals are jaw-dropping. The way he films the time inversion in action scenes is stunning. I found myself amazed at how he managed to choreograph so many of these sequences. We're without legendary Hans Zimmer for this Nolan film, but Ludwig Goransson takes the reins and exceeds every expectation. His pulse-pounding, breathless score was terrific and fit the film perfectly.I have to mention my biggest issue with the film: the sound mixing. A sizable chunk of the dialogue is inaudible due to the blaring score and background noises. This really hampered understanding and the overall experience. Nolan seems to be getting progressively worse about this ever since Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.I found Tenet to be extremely entertaining and stimulating. I appreciate that there is a director in Hollywood who loves creating challenging, yet rewarding movies for filmgoers. Tenet is a fascinating puzzle to unravel and I'm excited to put more pieces together on future watches.",Tenet

Well, I have only watched it once, but I have an observation: The movie hinges on paradox...and reviewing it is a sort of paradox too. Is it brilliant or silly? Yes. And it cannot really be either without being both. Nolan is an exceptionally talented filmmaker with a penchant for convoluted timelines, big reveals, and action sequences made cool via cinematography (and well-tailored suits). He uses all his tricks here. It is like Inception had a lovechild with a Bond movie, but the baby ended up wearing a time-turner from the Department of Mysteries. I found myself really enjoying the ride even when I had very little idea what was happening...then I figured out what was happening and was like ""Wait, that's it?"" The movie tries way too hard and makes way too little sense, but I mostly enjoyed it anyways. Maybe a second viewing will help, but more than likely it's a paradox.

158,asda-man,A palindromic WOW,10,26 August 2020,"If there was one film that was going to put a halt to a pandemic then it was always going to be Tenet. A film so Earth-shattering in size and spectacle that people would pop on their masks, sanitise their little hands and sit one seat apart from everyone to experience the first blockbuster since corona came and ruined our lives.Christopher Nolan tends to divide opinion with people thinking he's the next messiah of the film world or a pseudo-intellectual bore who places big set-pieces above multi-layered characters and a meaningful plot. I'm very much on the former side of the scale. I rarely give a film 10/10 but I have given every Nolan film this rating post The Prestige and therefore regard him as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 21st century.Reviews for Tenet were decidedly mixed when previews were given to critics last Friday and so I did have some creeping doubts when I sat in front of the gigantic IMAX screen in Nottingham today. However, these doubts were put to rest within literally the first fifteen seconds of the film starting where I quickly realised that there was simply no experience quite like watching a thunderous Christopher Nolan film.The plot is almost impossible for me to spoil because my teeny tiny brain could barely comprehend any of what was going on. It also didn't help that half of the dialogue was lost due to the booming score. Not sure if this was due to the cinema I saw it in or poor sound mixing which Nolan has been criticised for before, naughty man. Frankly, I didn't care. A clue is given early on by an exposition-friendly scientist character who tries to help us understand the whole time inversion basis of the film where she quips, 'Don't try to understand it. Just feel it.'The concept does become slightly clearer as the film goes on, blowing our helpless minds in the process but it doesn't matter particularly. Part of the fun of watching a Christopher Nolan for the first time is getting as lost in the labyrinth of plot as the protagonist is. Inception and Interstellar felt almost as impenetrable upon first watch and have now been cracked thanks to multiple views and countless explanation videos on Youtube.Even if you can't be bothered to think, you're bound to be in awe of the spectacle of it all. Nolan never does anything by halves and by Christ he's pulled out every stop for this film. There's a string of insane action sequences which had me scooping my jaw off the floor countless times. The behind the scenes extras are going to be fascinating because I still can't wrap my head around how half of these stunts were done.Things only get more spectacular as the film goes on with sequences playing backward and forward sometimes at the same time. The intensity is also ramped up to 11 thanks to Ludwig Goransson's thumping, headache-inducing score. I was a little worried that things might feel a little odd with the absence of Hans Zimmer, but fear not, this is still the relentlessly thrilling Nolan blockbuster we all want be immersed in. It's a real cinematic experience which cannot be put into words.Detractors are always going to find things to criticise. One review called it 'humourless' which I find a little bizarre. Do they really want Kenneth Branagh to perform a tap-dancing routine as he's plotting to destroy the world? In actual fact, I was surprised to find quite a few witty lines which allowed us to stop holding our breath and breathe for just a second or two. If I were to find any criticism with the film then it would be that Kenneth Branagh's character (although brilliantly played) is a bit of a two-dimensional villain. However, he's so memorably vile that I found myself actually being quite terrified of him.During the explosive third act, my head was completely scrambled and I found myself wondering whether this whole film was the work of a genius or a madman. Who the heck could conjure up something this intricate and convoluted, yet remain so blissfully entertaining? What ever your opinion of Nolan you surely have to admire the sheer ambition and innovation he brings to the world of film. I can only imagine that the layers of Tenet's genius will be revealed upon multiple viewings and they're viewings that most of us are going to want to take. My head was completely spinning when I stepped outside into the real world. To sum Tenet up in a one-word palindrome, WOW!",Tenet

160,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,7 April 2021,"The stage curtains open ...The director of ""Tenet"", Christopher Nolan, was also the screen writer. According to sources, it took him over 5 years to write - that after over ten years of deliberation. And it shows. As I was watching the movie, I became so dislodged and lost, in fact, I became ""inverted"" to the point where I wondered if even the screenwriter knew what the hell was going on. Because, I sure didn't.We start the story off with a bang, immediately drawn in to this world with an amazing opening scene that literally involves hundreds of extras that I won't soon forget. A CIA agent, who we come to know as the Protagonist, is hired by a secret organization called Tenet to find the manufacturer of inverted bullets, bullets that can travel backwards through time, and stop a possible paradox that could spell the end of the world. These bullets are being made sometime in the future, which takes the Protagonist on an unprecedented trail of action and intrigue.That is basically what I got out of it, and believe me when I say I was paying close attention because I had been warned going in that you needed to. First, the positives. The cinematography, special effects and visuals were simply jaw dropping in parts. There is enough eye candy here to boggle the mind, and that is the strength of this action film. The acting was good as well, with well choreographed fight scenes and action sequences. However, the sound mixing was awful. While I was straining to hear the dialogue, the film's score was too loud or distracting, so I lost out on a lot of the actual plot and had to read about it afterwards to catch up. It was already moving super fast, and they didn't make things any easier.I honestly cannot justify recommending this film. If all you want is 2 hours of mind blowing visuals, then this is your thing. If you need to be clued in along the way of what is going on, you will be lost and will probably end up feeling as I did - a lost opportunity. I give this a solid 6 stars out of 10.

Basically, you need to have an open & introspective mind while watching this film otherwise it is not going to make any sense.
As usual, like other Nolan film's, this one is also to be understood only by analysing few things on our own & watching others' explanation/perspective as well.",Tenet
162,ronakkotian,Nolan's most complex film yet,7,30 August 2020,"It felt so good to be able to watch a film in a cinema again and hopefully Tenet can keep cinemas afloat during this time of crisis in our world.In Tenet a Protagonist, armed with only one word and the survival of the world, journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.I honestly did not know how to summarise this film's plot. There was a time where people told me how complex Inception was and after viewing it, I thought it was fairly straightforward and easy to follow. Tenet, however, is on a whole another level. One viewing is simply not enough to understand everything that goes on in this film and that makes me so much more excited to watch it again. The first hour or so, Tenet leaves so many questions in your mind and it's not until after that where a few things start to get cleared up. To an average moviegoer, this film may be inaccessible due to how hard it is to follow and because of that I can see a group of people not liking Tenet. Despite not understanding everything that happens, I had a complete blast watching it.If we're talking about technical aspects, what Christopher Nolan was able to accomplish is astounding. Nolan loves time and the concept of inversion creates some very impressive action sequences. The action scenes are so unique and extremely well put together. Some people move forwards whilst others move backwards and when they fight together, it becomes so gripping and entertaining. Two particular sequences taking place at an airport and highway were mesmerising. Nolan's choice of using practical effects has created so many memorable scenes and Tenet is full of them. It's a shame Hans Zimmer couldn't do the score for this film but Ludwig Göransson fills in his place brilliantly. The score and music fits the film really well and there are hints of reversal which matches the theme of the film perfectly. The only technical flaw was the film's sound mixing. Remember how hard it was to understand Bane in The Dark Knight Rises without subtitles. Tenet suffers the same issue. At times the music is so loud that it becomes difficult to decipher what characters are saying.The performances are also great. After BlacKkKlansman, John David Washington delivers another terrific performance. Robert Pattinson has been really impressing me lately and he does a great job once again. I haven't been exposed to Elizabeth Debicki much but from this film she shows her capabilities as an actress. Dimple Kapadia does well and I think Kenneth Branagh played the villain role well. The problem with these characters is how distant you feel from them. Debicki is the only one you really connect with and care for. In Inception we felt connected to DiCaprio because of his wife and in Interstellar there was a connection with McConaughey due to his daughter in the film. Our lead in Tenet doesn't have anything like that so it became hard to resonate with him.Tenet is certainly not Nolan's best film but I would rather watch this film again over some of his other films. This is a puzzle I would love to solve and I'm in complete awe at the effort that went into the story and visuals. I was consistently entertained and cannot wait to give it another watch. If you don't want to risk going to the cinemas that's completely understandable but definitely watch Tenet when it comes out on VOD or Blu-ray.",Tenet
163,Stanlee107,Mind imploded,7,20 September 2020,Wow what a thought provoking film this is. I feel as though you need to have a good grasp of the laws of time travel & telling you all about it out of sync to fully understand and appreciate this film. Christopher Nolan took the complexity of Inception & pushed the idea to the next evolving/ inverting level for this film.There are great performances from all the cast. You will have to watch it more than once to fully appreciate it.,Tenet
164,johannes2000-1,Much (impressive) ado about nothing.,5,2 September 2020,"I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person, and I love scifi-movies, but I didn't understand a thing of what the hell was going on in this movie. Sure, something with people from the future playing people in the present by ""inversing"" persons or things or situations in time, a villain who tries to use this to annihilate the whole world and a hero who's gonna prevent this. But all the sparsely disseminated info on the what's, who's and why's was totally incomprehensible mumbojumbo to me, and all the goings-on totally eluded my modest brain.This was all the more a pity, since cinematographically this actually is a very entertaining movie. The action-scenes were spectacular, as were the special effects, the settings and locations were impressive and the acting was great: I loved John David Washington, tough, tender and authoritative
at the same time (wouldn't he make a great 007?!), Robert Pattinson was a real surprise in his intriguing role and Elizabeth Debicki is not only a classic beauty but also a very talented actress.But alas, this is not enough to make for a good movie, I would say that an understandable and coherent story is a basic necessity. If not, what remains is a case of much impressive and entertaining ado about nothing.",Tenet
165,statuskuo,Christopher Nolan Is A Magician,9,6 January 2021,"We are sorely going to miss stylist directors once corporations take over all cinema. And you bots who can't engage are going to...well, you guys will never know. But in today's entertainment world, we're being pacified by superhero garbage.
Stylist don't exist anymore. Tony Scott, Stanley Kubrick, Alan Parker, Francis Ford Coppola and so on...
These are filmmakers whose handprint is on the movie. You could argue David Fincher..but his movies are so cold and sterile, it's hard to see the humanity behind them.
So, admittedly, having finished watching the film, I was deeply confused. Absolutely engaged, but utterly baffled. I did some research on social media (which is one of the few benefits of it) and discovered great insight into the film. So much so it elevated the film to a gem of a puzzle.
Now should people have to explain a movie to me in order for me to ""get it"" It doesn't hurt my feelings. For a lot of critics of this flick, it seems they felt cheated. I do feel sorry for you. Because upon second viewing, it becomes a more amazing film.
Movies like this will have longevity over anything Marvel has done. That's a fact.
It has a human element that transcends spandex and iron suits. And though the goal in this film is corny, the journey to get there is incredible.
A film should make you watch repeatedly to get the nuance. For those who are more disposable...again, I pity you.",Tenet
166,trinaboice,Your head will explode,10,2 September 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Director Christopher Nolan serves a cerebral plate of action and sci-fi intrigue, perfect for those who loved the brain-scratchers Inception and Interstellar. The director is a huge James Bond fan, which shows in the film. He intentionally did NOT watch any Bond movies while he worked on this film but chose to rely more on the feeling he remembered he got from watching them.At a budget of $205 million, this is Christopher Nolan's most expensive film and the first major studio film to be released during the Covid-19 pandemic.This is one of those movies you have to watch twice to fully appreciate. The more you understand it, the more you appreciate it.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

RealityTHINGS I LIKED:
The movie starts off with a bang...literally.
I love movies that play around with the concept of time. The working title for this film was ""Merry Go Round.""
John David Washington was an athlete in college, so his physicality for the action scenes was completely believable. He said he could hardly run for a month after filming. I thought he was excellent in the movie Blackkklansman. You can see my review of that film here. Did you know he's Denzel Washington's son? Sometimes he even sounds like his dad in this movie.
I think James Pattinson is a very good actor and was overlooked for his outstanding performance in The Lighthouse. You can see my review of that film here. Christopher Nolan offered him the role because he was impressed with Pattinson's performance in Good Time. He refuses to use his own London accent and says he would feel like a fraud of an actor to speak like himself. He also said that the secrecy surrounding this project was so strict that he and co-star John David Washington were only allowed to read the script in a locked room at the actual Warner Brothers studios. Even worse, actor Michael Caine was only allowed to read the pages of the script that had his lines on them. He had absolutely no idea what the movie was about until its release!
Be impressed with the effects because no green screens were used. To make the inversion scenes, director Christopher Nolan shot each scene twice: forward and backward. Yes, that means that the cast how to learn how to speak backward! Kenneth Branagh had to learn how to speak Russian backward! But wait, those stunts also had to be performed backward!
Speaking of Kenneth Branagh, he was excellent.
Be equally impressed with the soundtrack because it was pieced together online from the individual recordings of the musicians in their homes after the Coronavirus prevented them from practicing or performing together. This is actually the first Christopher Nolan movie NOT to be scored by Hans Zimmer. Zimmer wasn't available to do this film, so he suggested his friend Ludwig Goransson.
In order to get that unique sound from the villain, composer Ludwig Goransson recorded and tweaked Christopher Nolan's own breathing.
I loved seeing the car chase scenes filmed in Estonia. I visited the beautiful city of Tallinn. They used the Kumu Art Museum in Tallinn as the fictional Oslo Freeport. The opera house scene was also shot in Tallinn at a venue that was falling apart so much that the crew had to practically rebuild it.
Elizabeth Debicki was outstanding. The first time I ever saw her was in Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) where she looked like a real goddess. Christopher Nolan offered her the role without auditioning but she insisted on auditioning to show herself she could do it.
That catamaran scene was crazy. It's an F50 foiling catamaran, the fastest racing class in history, reaching speeds over 50 knots (more than 60 miles per hour.)
I love that the title of the movie is a palindrome: TENET, which is perfect for a movie that illustrates things going forward and backward. The word ""TENET"" actually originated from the Sator Square, a puzzle that spells 5 words in every direction when rotated: Tenet, Sator, Arepo, Opera, and Rotas. All of those words appear in the movie as people's names or locations.
I love it when a director uses carefully thought-out details. For example, in this film, the color red is used to indicate time going forward. Blue is used to show the time inversion. The color motif is actually based on the Doppler effect. The musical score also changes to indicate the inverted time. But wait...there's more. In the final battle scene, the red team and blue team both have ten minutes to complete their missions. That's TEN forwards and TEN backward. Wow. Did your head just explode?
Non-stop action and pacing.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I remember the first time I saw the trailer about a year ago. I had no idea what the movie was going to be about. Some viewers will still be very confused and wonder what the heck they just saw.
Christopher Nolan went to great lengths to film scenes in IMAX, so it's a shame that so few people will actually be able to see the movie in IMAX in a theater.
Sometimes it's hard to hear what people are saying, which makes it even more difficult to understand what's happening. Watch this film with subtitles if you can!
The soundtrack was often overbearing with the potential to give you a headache by the end of the movie.INTERESTING LINES:""We're trying to prevent World War 3."" - Barbara (Clemence Poesy) ""Nuclear Holocaust?"" - The Protagonist (John David Washington) ""No, something worse."" - Barbara

167,dilipbts,Tenet,10,10 December 2020,"As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.",Tenet
168,rubenm,There is so much wrong with this movie,3,28 August 2020,"Most people are familiar with the effect of a film clip being played backwards. You see bullets flying back into the barrel, or buildings magically rising from a pile of rubble, or cars driving in reverse at breakneck speed. This gimmick is the central theme 'Tenet' is built upon.
Of course, director Christopher Nolan uses complicated words like 'inversed entropy' to make it all a bit more interesting. The way he plays with time going forward and backwards at the same time, is an original and intriguing storytelling technique. It also gives him the opportunity to show off his abilities as a director. Filming a car chase with cars going forward and backwards simultaneously on the same road is definitely a tour de force.
But the bad news is that Nolan drowns his original concept in a bloated action movie with clichéd characters and a screenplay that's going nowhere. A creepy Russian oligarch threatening to end human existence, a shootout in a crowded opera house, a Boeing 747 crashing into a large building, and of course a damsel in distress - it's all terribly Bond-like. But the difference is that 007 can get away with that sort of thing, because in Bond movies, things are not meant to be taken too seriously. In 'Tenet', on the other hand, everything is dead serious. Not a single moment of comic relief is to be found in the whole movie.
Instead of concentrating on the inversed flow of time, like he did in 'Memento', Nolan has packed this movie with so much ideas, locations, fights, chases, twists and turns that the viewer loses every sense of direction and desperately wonders what he is looking at.
At one point, the Protagonist is climbing the inside of a large offshore wind turbine. But why? We never find out. And what is the point of the female lead? Difficult to believe that she is the Protagonist's love interest, because they hardly spend any screen time together. And what is the purpose of the Michael Caine character, apart from including Michael Caine in the film? The viewer is left with so many inconsistencies and unanswered questions that he almost forgets there are also good parts.
Tenet's budget was 205 million dollars. I think it would have been a much better film if Nolan would have spent half that money, and focused on what he really wants to tell the audience.",Tenet
169,AvionPrince16,WOW!,8,11 May 2021,I expected really nothing from this movie. I was interested only because christopher nolan directed the movie. What to say about it? Its really one of a kind. I never watched a movie like this. So incredible with the reverse thing. We can see an authentic movie without the CGI and we can appreciate this. This is so pleasing and believable. The story confused me sometimes but this is a movie who need to be watched twice or more. Its defintely worth it.,Tenet
170,andrewroy-04316,"An exciting execution of a wild premise, but there's not enough beneath the concept",7,14 September 2020,"It's been almost a week since I've seen the film because I really wanted to fully process it before writing this. Nolan is easily my favorite director and Tenet is my most anticipated movie ever, so this is a difficult review for me to write. I love Nolan for his ambitious, high-concept ideas, and Tenet certainly has that (time inversion? I love it), but I also love him for the way he blends this mind bending story with characters you care about and extreme depth of themes. My two favorite of his films, The Dark Knight and The Prestige, are perfect showcases of this: they have an interesting central idea, but the beating heart of the films are their fascinating protagonists and the many themes they allow Nolan to explore.In Tenet, you have a wild idea: what if you had objects and people who could move backwards in time? It's a great sci-fi premise and Nolan does an undeniably amazing job creating the action scenes through practical effects. Ultimately, I do think it's more of an exploration of how this premise could happen in an action espionage setting than a backdrop for a more human story. The best way to describe this is: many of the people who love Tenet talk about how perfectly everything fits together, how rewatchable it is, and how you keep thinking and puzzling over it after it's done. I completely agree that those are great signs for a film and one of the things I love about Nolan movies, but I think it underscores Tenet's shortcoming actually. After you finish watching Tenet, all the questions you have and things you keep thinking about are purely mechanical - what was the timeline for this event? How did this happen when it did? There weren't any emotions I felt for the characters afterwards, characters I wanted to consider and dive deeper into, or major themes that resonated. Maybe on a rewatch some minor themes would reveal themselves, perhaps along the lines of how perfect information or perfect technology doesn't really make the world a better place, it just raises the dangerous stakes by making everyone, good or bad, more powerful. Even then I feel like I'm grasping a bit. The one character piece I did like was the relationship between The Protagonist and Neil. We see how loyal Neil is, and in the ending we see all of their interactions in a new light, which I love. Kat was definitely intended to be the emotional linchpin of the movie, and I do love Debicki's performance, but thought the script gave her a generic and over-the-top view. She is more desperate to save the world than others because she wants to save her son? Alright. The movie does for the most part make sense as you piece things together, but when you finally see that full picture it feels more like ""okay, that's what this movie is. What's interesting about it now that I know what happened in it?"" and less ""oh, that's so satisfying, now that I understand the film I'll really want to revisit and reconsider it.""Now this isn't to say that I think Tenet is a bad movie. I think it's a great premise and is extremely thoughtfully made, but I think the focus was so much on how to make an intricate plot that they didn't make it a resonant one. To tell the truth, Tenet felt far more like a Bond movie than I would've liked. I don't hate the Bond movies, I just think they're mediocre - fine action and a pretty generic plot (with plenty of misogyny), but nothing really exciting or anything deeper to explore. Tenet is certainly more riveting than the Bond movies I've seen - it's still a very well shot and acted film, and the plot is an interesting one at least. It does suffer from the same problem of being more flashy action than nuanced themes and characters, though. I do appreciate that Nolan plays off of Bond tropes in certain ways - not having scenes where the protagonist seduces a girl just for the sake of it, for instance. That general feel of prioritizing plot and style over substance is the biggest reason Tenet was a letdown for me.I will remark on the much maligned sound choices made by Nolan here. I do see both sides of the argument - it is an interesting conceptual exercise to treat the film as an experience and let the audience imagine as though they are experiencing it, so sound is loud as it is in real life and you don't always hear everything perfectly. Most viewers also do have a point that making a film whose primary source of intrigue is its intricate plot and premise have sound design that makes the audience unable to hear a good amount of dialogue is a problematic choice. At the end of the day it's not a huge issue for me, and I do like the way the gunfire in action scenes sounded very realistic, but I would've preferred sound design that prioritized understanding a bit more dialogue.I do think all three main performances by Washington, Pattinson, and Debicki are all very good. Washington is especially great in the action scenes, and the choreography and editing for those are absolutely stunning. The movie also does have several legitimately funny moments (my favorite being Pattinson's ""it wasn't impenetrable last week"" line). I also like Nolan's attempt to tie in the Sator square, but after thinking about it I really don't think it actually holds any deeper meaning and was just thrown in to add another level of parallelism and easter egg. I definitely do recommend the movie, as it is not easy to execute such an ambitious premise so well, and I was not bored for a second. At the same time, it's hard to look back on Tenet and not be disappointed when there's not much left for you to go back to and think deeper on, especially when I consider my level of anticipation for the film and how amazing it could've been.",Tenet
171,sbweightman,A mind bending and time bending experience,8,29 August 2020,"A Nolan film through and through, with plenty of his trademark style, spectacle and anxiety inducing bass heavy soundtrack. The action scenes are spectacular and cleverly put together, the acting is great and the plot comes together superbly by the end, but there is a lot of muddled exposition and the editing leaps make it harder to follow than it should be. In hindsight, the plot isn't really that complicated, but the presentation and subject matter overcomplicate things, and throughout it pushes you out of your comfort zone and really makes you think at times.",Tenet
172,Littleman95,Nolan Masterpiece!,10,28 August 2020,"Core: do you like science fiction, action, intricate plot? Well, if it is so this movie is a must-to-watch!I think that with this movie Nolan outdoes himself!
The story can freaks you out (in a good way), the acting is unbelievably good (yes, I had some doubt about Denzel's son and Pattinson). The soundtrack is good too (but this is just personal taste).The first half of the movie is pretty much not understandable because of all the information that you'll be receive is a lot and disjointed. So you'll be a lot to process.
During the second half all the pieces connects to the other and it will be more clear.
Anyway, to comprehend it more I think I'll have to watch it at least another time!If you had watched also other Nolan's movie I think you'll can spot some similarity to his older movies blended together and a particular reference to his other movie (The Prestige). Or is it just me?So, Nolan with this movie does an unbelievable work. And when I'll watch it the second time will be better and more clear.
Thanks Nolan for this masterpiece!",Tenet

174,judywalker2,not as interesting as it should have been,6,26 September 2020,"There have only be a few movies that were able to do time travel right, one was Momentum and the other Edge of Tomorrow. Tenet wasn't as interesting as it should have been. The cast was good and of course because it was the Inception director the visuals were seizure inducing. But, the plot and dialog was dull and boring. I had most of the answers before the movie was halfway into its plot. You know you're in trouble when you start checking your watch to see when this movie will be over. Only Neil was an interesting character. I got tired of emphasis on certain characters instead of on the plot to destroy the world.
Note to directors, just making a movie complicated doesn't make it interesting. I should have given it a 4 but I gave it a 6 because John David was good and I didn't get upset seeing Pattison (which I usually do).",Tenet

Oh, what just happened? Oh, wait a minute I don't think I'm quite keeping up with this ridiculously clever plot.Actually, it was quite the opposite that happened. It simply got to the point where you stop caring and I know that when I get to the point where I stopped caring whether or not the world survives, then I've become completely indifferent to a story. This film was simply too clever, it was too complex, it was too over-the-top, it was too Hollywood. It felt like a $200 million comic book.It was stupid, it was mindless, this film made me feel numb, this film made me feel nothing. I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters.

Not Nolan's best, but another home run from the best and most Notorious director of our generation.",Tenet
178,Xavier_Stone,Interesting film with many flaws,6,30 August 2020,"This is definitely a complex film in line with Interstellar and Inception and I feel that Nolan has to keep upping himself with each film. This one he over does the complexity and it requires several watches to fully grasp what's going on.This works with some people and is a disappointment to others. The characters and acting are actually good, however the sound mixing is way off and most of the dialogue is drowned out or muffled. I'm not sure how this obvious misstep wasn't fixed in preproduction, add in theater booming sound systems and this movie has several viewers covering their ears unable to understand any speaking parts. The musical score is nothing but loud bass noises.With a seemingly unlimited budget Nolan has and the fact that theaters are still dealing with virus fears this movie should have been delayed another 6 months and had the sound and editing cleaned up. It could have been a huge money film with a genuine 10 star rating. No reason to rush such and expensive project to an audience that can't/won't pay to see it and then see it with simple sound errors.Very poor management decision to release this.",Tenet
179,PyroSikTh,"""You Feel It"" But There's Nothing to Feel",7,26 August 2020,"Tenet follows The Protagonist (a clever way to eschew naming the main character and keeping an air of mystery over his identity) as he tries to prevent World War III. There's a secret Cold War going on behind the scenes, and this time instead of being nuclear weaponry, it's time inversion. This is explained in the movie as items having their entropy introverted. Entropy is the concept of things decaying over time. Inverting this means things instead seek structure. Instead of firing a bullet, you catch it. From your perspective, the bullet is acting irrationally; moving backwards through time. But to the bullet, everything else around it is moving backwards. If this was applied to the entire world, it would result in the ultimate Armageddon, and this is what the Protagonist seeks to prevent.Nolan always said that Inception was his Bond movie, but ultimately Inception is just a fancy heist movie that shares little traits with a Bond film. Tenet is Nolan's realisation of that. Tenet is Nolan's real Bond movie. The Protagonist is ex-CIA, declared dead in the opening half hour, and sent on a globe-trotting adventure as he tracks down and infiltrates the source of the time inversions. A large portion of the movie is spent with the Protagonist spying, disguising, and pretending to be other people. Sometimes it feels like one long commercial for high society. The first steps of his investigation have him masquerading as a billionaire, and then a US Ambassador. Every time he gets into a bind, he manages to somehow talk his way out with fake deals, and every now and then some fisticuffs. He has his own Felix Leiter in Neil, as well as his own Bond girl in Kat, the abused wife of the film's villain. There are car chases, gun-fights, and the constant suspense of being double-crossed. Andrei Sator doesn't have a physical ailment as Bond villains usually do, but he's as ruthless and world-dominating as the best of them. Take away the whole time inversion concept, and Tenet is just another spy movie.Tenet is a movie that is hard to follow though, and not the reasons you'd think. The time inversion can get janky as the movie goes on, but it remains fairly easy to keep track of nonetheless. In fact Tenet is hard to follow thanks to holes in the film's narrative. We jump around from one scene to another with very little time to transition. He is declared dead early, given some spiel about passing a test, and told that the word 'Tenet' will unlock many doors for him. Why? Who knows. It's barely touched upon again in the whole movie. I'm still not sure what the relevance of the title even is. I've read that it might be the name of the organisation the Protagonist gets involved with, but I can't recall any evidence that there's even a secret organisation at all. There's also a moment where the Protagonist gets blown up in a backwards car chase, and then appears in a shipping container perfectly fine heading to an unknown destination. The action scene just ends without any transition to the next one. Once the time inversion starts getting cooky, these scene jumps get even more sporadic. We follow the characters going forward, and then they're going backward, and then they're going forward again, but no reason is actually given beforehand. We're left chasing the answers in expository dialogue given after the fact.And talking of the dialogue, you can't hear half of it. This has been a problem at least since The Dark Knight (looking at you Jim Gordon mumbling in the mayor's office), but at least some effort was made in the following four movies to make sure the dialogue isn't completely drowned out by background noise (including Tom Hardy re-recording his lines in a sound booth). The reason this even happens is Nolan wants to immerse you in the experience, so everything's turned up loud. The movie opens with such a loud synth crash that I'm glad I managed to go to the loo beforehand otherwise I'd have had damp underwear for the movie's entire runtime. Then there's gunshots in a narrow hallway that are deafeningly loud. But this is fine because there's no dialogue. Once the Protagonist is picked up on a boat and told about 'Tenet', we've got the sound of the rushing waves to contend with. And then there's all the breathing apparatus that gets in the way and muffles everything, as well as a conversation between Protagonist and Sator where one of them speaks backwards and has to have a translator correct it over the top of the response. That's two voices saying three different things all at the same time, and then because of the time difference between them, the question and answer shtick kind of does but also kind of doesn't make sense? In a movie where the dialogue does most the explaining, it just leaves you lost half the time. I don't know, maybe the missing transitions I previously mentioned actually are there but I just simply couldn't hear them.Okay, but what about the actual time inversion? Yeah, that makes sense, ironically enough. Invert your entropy, and you travel backwards through time. From your perspective you're still moving forwards, but everything else goes backwards. Rain moves upwards, you get sucked from blows of air, cars act weirdly because friction is backwards, oh and you need breathing apparatus because breathing doesn't work as intended when everything's backwards. Even when the movie dials this up to eleven with a final climax involving both backwards and forwards fighters (affectionately dubbed a temporal pincer), everything still kind of makes sense. Rocket launchers on both sides occur simultaneously, hitting the same building, and blowing it up in a slightly different way depending on your perspective. Throw in characters jumping between backwards and forwards entropy in the same scene and it gets really spicy. In true Nolan fashion this does lend itself to some really cool revelations though, including a nice River Song moment, but those I won't spoil.But to me the biggest failing of this movie is how clinical and matter of fact it is. Nolan's movies have been as strong as they are because they take the overloud, immersive spectacle merged with high concept, original ideas, and bring it together with a tight emotional hook. Cobb is haunted by his wife's suicide because she couldn't distinguish between dream and reality, Cooper misses the entire lives of his kids when an hour becomes twenty-five years, the dire situation of Dunkirk is saved by brave civilians going out and making a difference in the name of patriotism, the tragic tale of Harvey Dent who lived long enough to become the villain, or Leonard's constant, unending quest for vengeance against an antagonist who doesn't exist. Hell even Will and Walter sparring off over the difference between killing and murdering. Nolan's usually very good at keeping everything fundamentally to an emotional level, but Tenet is absent of emotion almost entirely. Protagonist is stone-faced from beginning to end, never once amazed by the notion of time inversion, lacks any chemistry at all with his Bond girl, and lacks any personal stakes in the story whatsoever. The most emotionality we get is from Kat's need to get her son back at all costs, but in the face of total Armageddon it almost comes off as whiny and selfish. Yes darling, we know you need to get out of this hateful, abusive marriage and get your son back, but we're kind of trying to prevent the end of all things here. The world doesn't revolve around you.But ultimately, we're told that we don't need to understand what's going on, we just need to feel it. It's hard to feel it in the truest sense thanks to the lack of emotional hook. But goddamn do you feel the suspense, the pumping of your heart as you see a real 747 careen uncontrollably into a warehouse, the struggle for air as you hold your breath along with characters as they struggle to breathe. Nolan sure as hell has massive action setpieces down to a fine art at this point. It doesn't matter if it's a shootout in an opera house, or wedging an armoured truck in with a fire engine, or a fistfight with someone in a different timeline altogether. We feel every punch, every gunshot, every dramatic blam of the music.I'm not going to lie, I'm a little disappointed in Tenet on a first viewing. Expectations ruin everything, but Nolan has consistently been making some of my favourite movies for over a decade. Tenet feels like another Dark Knight Rises, where all the ingredients are there, but they fail to mesh together in quite the same way as the rest of his movies. With no emotional hook, dialogue drowned out by bad sound mixing, and rushed editing, Tenet feels unusually amateurish or generic at times. It remains enjoyable by the merit of its concept and action sequences, but misses that little extra that makes Nolan movies as truly immersive as they usually are. I give Tenet a 7/10, which wouldn't be bad coming from any other director. It's certainly not Nolan's worst movie, but it's down there. No doubt Tenet is another that just requires multiple viewings in an environment where I can control the volume myself to reach maximum enjoyment.",Tenet

181,dfle3,"Tenet: An ambitious high-concept film with paradoxical, mind-bending action. '75+%'",8,28 August 2020,"Director Christopher Nolan brings yet another brain-aching story to the cinema, as he did previously with Inception (which I see I scored 75% here). This time the plot concerns our hero, a CIA agent who refers to himself as ""The Protagonist"" (played by African American John David Washington), who must the save the world from destruction. The high-concept of the film, without going into too much detail, deals with what physicists call ""The arrow of time"". Not being a scientist myself, as far as I understand it, these scientists believe that there is no reason in physics why time must travel from the past to the future. In the world of The Protagonist, there is no more arrow of time. Here, the future and the past and the present can, and will, collide. The fate of the world is at stake. I hadn't realised that I scored Inception so well and I thought that I got more out of this film. I think it's a 70% kind of movie but I'm bumping up my score by 5+% to reward Nolan for being so ambitious with his choice of subject matter, which puts the film into 8/10 star territory here on IMDB.The high-concept of the film is something that I have pondered myself and the parts of the film dealing with this are ideas that I had formed myself, namely, the notion that information can hypothetically be able to be transmitted from the future to the past (and how that would benefit people receiving that information). The film takes that one step further than I would want to, which is what makes it an interesting action film.Now, I'm not convinced that physicists would countenance the world of this film, as far as there being localised instances of this high-concept, as opposed to time's arrow just moving in one direction or the other. Perhaps the film smuggles in instances of parallel worlds or time travel and they don't really fit in or make sense when used with the core high-concept of the film. In some ways the time travel aspect is more complex than that of another film dealing with that specific idea, Primer. I've reviewed Primer here and noted how you really need a notepad and spreadsheets to keep tabs on what is happening. Or you could just ask the scriptwriter(s) to explain what the Hell is happening. In that way, Tenet is nowhere near as brain-aching and mentally taxing as Primer...but I would still question Nolan (as well as Kip Thorne) to see whether the scenarios are plausible, which I doubt that they are.A general problem with time travel stories is that I just don't believe them. I don't find them coherent. This feeling isn't dispelled by Tenet but that in no way detracted from my experience of it. If you don't think too much about the high-concept high jinks, there's pleasure to be had watching all the action unfold. Not finding these kinds of stories coherent, I wouldn't be the kind of person who would watch the film again believing that it will all make sense on a second viewing. Personally, this isn't the kind of film that would make me want to see it again just because I found it entertaining. For that reason, I wouldn't see it again just for the sake of a faint hope that everything will make sense on another viewing of it.One way in which a repeat viewing might help to make sense of things better though is that although the film is helpful with regard to the frenetic action of the finale by colour coding combatants, my problem was that I forgot what the two colours used signified! It's for these less than high-concept reasons that I can see value in seeing the film again. But I won't.To be relevant in an opaque way, whilst pondering the significance of the film's title, it occurred to me that it was a palindrome. That's kind of a primer for the film. You get little teases for the high-concept in action but Nolan does make you wait a while before throwing it at you in Hollywood action set pieces, which would be the calling card for it.This brings me to a criticism of the film: at times, people just struck me as being idiots, in the way that characters in Ridley Scott's sequels to Alien struck me as being stupid (I've said that in my reviews of those films here). There were two instances of this that I noticed: firstly, the people in a security vehicle in a heist sequence (and let's not forget the police who appear in a car later in that sequence) and, secondly, a set piece where there is a fight between a man in a gas mask in a corridor and The Protagonist. When this sequence was revisited, I was wondering why on Earth the man in the mask would try to shoot The Protagonist. It's Ridley Scott level stupidity.Another criticism of the film is more practical: at times I found it hard to understand the dialogue for various reasons. Things like people speaking with thick accents, people speaking whilst wearing gas masks or just being off-centre as far as microphone placement goes, I suppose. I didn't quite catch what the Indian woman said right at the end of the film. What was that last thing that she said? Maybe nothing too great is lost by not hearing it. But it would have been nice to have heard it clearly in any case.I can't help thinking that in current times, with what's happening or has happened in America (the #MeToo movement and the police murdering African American civilians), that audiences may resonate with an African American action hero and a key woman in the story. It should be noted that that there is no romance to be found here.Lastly, I thought Daniel Radcliffe was in this film. Wrong! It's another former teen franchise idol.Oh, I forgot to mention, maybe this film is a bit like the video game ""Braid""?

183,ethanbresnett,Films can be confusing and fantastic - they aren't mutually exclusive!!,8,28 December 2020,"Ok... lets get the negatives out of the way. There's way too much exposition, and it isn't done particularly well. It sticks out like a sore thumb and does mess with the pacing of the film a bit. As a result, Tenet is maybe 20 minutes too long. The dialogue isn't up to usual Nolan standards and is quite clunky in parts. I also don't think the characters were as intriguing or developed as in other Nolan films.Then we come to the big question. Does it make sense? No... sort of... maybe?I understood the headlines, and was pretty much up to speed with the general gist. There are gaps and intricacies that need to be digested further, and elements that would benefit from a second viewing. To quote one character at about the 15 minute mark - ""don't try to understand it"". That definitely rings true to some extent. In fairness though, its only a tad more complicated than Inception and on a par with Interstellar in my opinion, so don't let this put you off. It's a thoroughly engaging story, and I love films that get you thinking and mess with your head. Tenet does not fail in this regard.Now lets dive into the positives. As confusing as it is, the concept is really cool. I appreciate it could be a bit marmite, but I loved it. I was hooked and was fully onboard with Nolan's vision. It was very unique, very stylish, and engrossing. That's what I love about films that are confusing and that have their own rule book to play with. You never know where the story is going to go, and I find this uncertainty exciting.John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are both fantastic actors and, despite not being at their best in this, it is great to see them both on screen, and they were very solid.The cinematography is always exceptional in a Nolan epic, and Tenet is no exception. The film looked flawless and was a feast for the eyes. The way the film messed with physics allowed for some gripping set pieces and very cool effects, which were well done.Tenet only gets an 8 purely because I think it is one of Nolan's more unrefined films. All of the right parts are there, but I think maybe Nolan got wrapped up in his own vision at times and couldn't see the wood for the trees. Still fantastic though, a fine addition to my blu-ray collection.",Tenet

Not to forget to mention that it lasted for 2.5 hours, which is a way too much. Except the story, everything else (especially the action scene and, again, bad Russian one-dimensional charachter) is already seen and familiar. Ultimately, I felt disappointed because the movie was overly complicated and too clever for its own good.Rating: 5+/6- because as a result, it's a let down.",Tenet

It's a shame the only emotion is found in yet another Russian villain and a simply modernized damsel-in-distress (Debicki's turn remains excellent though).

186,TwistedContent,"Awesome, But Not Without Flaws",7,12 January 2021,"Christopher Nolan is a name every self-respecting movie-going person knows, a man who has directed 10/10's then and again, including such awesome movies like ""The Prestige"", ""Inception"", ""Memento"", the Dark Knight trilogy, and more. This name also brings high standards with it. Nolan has seemingly always been fascinated with the idea of time and all the paradoxes it brings with it & ""Tenet"" is, perhaps, the pinnacle of that fascination. Personally, plots about time-travel, time-distortion, any time shenanigans etc., to me often seem endless. You always can drag time-related ideas endlessly, and end exactly how you want and when, because time is so paradoxical and flexible in any and all philosophies, that there simply are no right or wrong answers. To me, ""Tenet"" proves that these concepts are not always enough to base a solidified movie on, and find satisfaction in. ""Tenet"" is an absolute spectacle, but also possibly the most flawed Christopher Nolan film. Couple spoilers ahead.Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time - that's the synopsis right here on IMDb. Fact of the matter is, it doesn't fundamentally go much deeper than that. It is indeed in core a good, old-fashioned espionage thriller, with the cliché storyline and everything. The evil man gets stopped, and the evil powers (in this case a device that can mess up time) get buried so no one can used them - it's an ending we've seen before more than once. But this espionage adventure has a strong sci-fi backbone, and Nolan has a grand time manufacturing a complicated plot & making the movie feel as palindromic as its name. Despite the mystery and complications that radiate from ""Tenet"", I see it more as a rollercoaster with sharp twists and turns, and less like a puzzle. For a movie with a runtime of 2 and a half hours, I found that some characters are quite shallow, some supporting characters underdeveloped, and the main protagonist is struggling to maintain constant care for him. Certain layers of film are left unfulfilled in favor of sci-fi and explaining time.However, performances are on-point, everyone seems to be more than happy working in a Nolan movie. John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki all provide grounded, relatively subtle characters in an offbeat world, and that's perfect. On a technical level, much like previous works by Nolan, ""Tenet"" is impeccable and beautiful, an IMAX movie for sure. Cinematography's so polished, the original score (as per tradition in Nolan movies as well) is excellent, this time by Ludwig Goransson (The Mandalorian, Creed) & there are many stylized, interesting fight/action scenes, because of their reverse nature, though even this gets a little old...""Tenet"" is a loud (or silent when it comes to dialogue), expensive, visceral experience where Nolan takes You through time and timelines, has fun with quantum physics and blowing the lid off the fabric of reality - it is, all together, cinema-through-and-through, a blockbuster that's still emotionally and intelligently engaging, even if it feels like there could've been more. The wheel is not exactly re-invented, but it is spun like mad. I have no doubt second and third viewings find more details - whatever happened, was always going to happen. My rating: 7/10.",Tenet

188,david-meldrum,"Visually Stunning, But Nothing's Really There To Move You",7,31 August 2020,"If ever a film was going to collapse under the weight of what's expected of it, then it's this one. Nolan's been playing in the big leagues for some time now, and this was always going to be a big-budget summer tentpole type film; now the task it faces is to save the cinema industry. No pressure, then.Given all that, a degree of disappointment is inevitable. This, at the end of August, was my first trip to the cinema since mid-December last year; I've watched plenty of films since then, but none of them in the cinema, Being an immune-suppressed person, I was also nervous - would the cinema be safe for me; would the staff there be COVID compliant. No worries on that latter score, I'm pleased to say. But still, it's very 2020 to come out of the screening to see cleaners in something closely resembling a HAZMAT suit; so one's mind is never entirely at peace.But what of the film? It looks (several) million dollars, of course; we all know Nolan knows how to show you things you've never seen before and could scarcely have imagined in visceral, tangible ways. It starts with a relentless action set-piece and barely stops until the end of the film - even when the scenes are dialogue rather than action-driven, there's a breathless quality to them.Which is just as well, because the plot it all over the place; if you stop to think for a moment you'll see it's not there. I mean, there' s a whole lot of Science (that first letter should be VERY BIG) about entropy and multi-verses and the like. People say they don't understand that, and I know what they mean; but I think what they really mean is that they don't understand the story (because there isn't really one at all); the science makes some degree of sense. I know that because I'm a science idiot who can barely count, with two humanities degrees, and it seemed to make some kind of sense to me scientifically. Endearingly ridiculous, of course, but the science did add up on its own terms in as much as it needed to.But the plot is a bunch of stuff thrown together to give an excuse for some cool action set-pieces to string together. Thanks to Tenet, you haven't seen what a car chase can look like until you've seen this car chase. Trust me; you really haven't seen anything like this before.I understood the peril at stake in the movie - the end of, well, everything. On a micro-scale, there's some stuff about a marriage where abuse is worryingly skipped over, and a bit about some other stuff. But it's the macro that matters here, and there's the rub. Nolan is often criticised for making cold, unemotional films. I think that's unfair; The Prestige is deeply moving, the more so with every rewatch as you gather the full extent of what's going on and what's at stake. I find each of the Batman films moving in their own way, and there are emotional journeys to engage with in Dunkirk. But here? It's all too big to grasp and everything happened without it ever meaning anything for the heart or soul. An aimless ending voiceover suggests an interesting idea about no-one noticing the bombs that don't go off; there's rich thematic material to be mined about doing the stuff no-one notices. But it doesn't land. Stuff will happen and has happened, and that's it. It happens with visual flair and you'll want to see it again, but your heart will be pretty much where it was before you saw it the first time.All of which explains the performances. Everyone seems stilted and a bit wooded; even the always engaging Kenneth Branagh as a VERY BAD person. Even he didn't move me, but I don't think it was the performer's fault. It was just that nothing really connected. Nolan has thus far not made a boring or bad film; this isn't one of those, close as it comes to those twin pitfalls. It's just one to see, forget .... and to see once or twice more for the car chase if nothing else (did I mention it's an incredible car chase?).Where Nolan goes from here, heaven knows. There's no way this, or any other film in cinema history, could do what is asked of this film. Heavy hangs the head, indeed. We all hope, fervently, it does enough to provide the boost on which so many jobs depends. So go see it, for that reason alone if you can. But as Nolan films go, you've seen many better",Tenet
189,Lebowskidoo,"""Don't try to understand it. Feel it.""",9,16 April 2021,"Tenet is an extremely inventive and impressive sci-fi action thriller adventure from the wondrous mind of Christopher Nolan. It's so imaginative and creative that it may just be a bit too much to absorb all at once, this might take a few more rewatches in order to fully understand. This level of film mastery doesn't usually come along every day. Nolan has been working on this story for twenty years, I'm sure even he was confused at several points in the creation of this.John David Washington, who is excellent here, plays a secret agent who learns of an attack coming from the future to potentially destroy the present world. That's as simple as I can word it, it just grows more and more complex from then on. It was like a puzzle or math problem that really strained your brain, but in a good way.Even if you never fully understand what's happening, the movie is a thrilling visual treat with insanely extravagant action sequences and the acting is top notch. Kenneth Branagh redeems himself for certain recent flops by giving a great performance as a truly despicable villain. Robert Pattinson is great, but his role is more of a sidekick. He probably took the role in order to work with Nolan, smart choice. A few familiar faces from previous Nolan movies appear, like Michael Caine and Martin Donovan.It's great knowing that someone cares enough to go to such lengths to create a movie on this spectacular level. Nolan is clearly a leader in the industry, pushing the boundaries, inventing newer ways of telling stories, like James Cameron. I'd hate to think where movies would be without visionaries like him. Okay, this is turning into a gushfest.Watch Tenet, if you love a challenge and adventure.

Lush settings and a phenomenal cast pull off the task of drawing you in to a save the world plot involving arms dealers, plutonium, and time travel (inversion).
My only real complaint comes around the final big action scene with two swat or military like teams with separate objectives on a desert-like battle field where you can't really see the antagonist which felt a little First person shooter video game like (think Call of Duty).

192,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,No story...no characters...no movie,2,3 August 2021,"This is the first movie I have legitimately HATED in quite some time. The 2 and a half hour bore fest has almost zero winning elements. It's got a very effective music score. Outside of that, the movie has a couple of MILDLY amusing combat scenes occurring in reverse, as advertised, and one impressive death scene. That aside, what does Tenet really consist of?To me, it feels like Christopher Nolan decided that this film's schtick would simply be featuring a lot of reverse action footage - and that would make it stand out enough to win people over. Well, it did work in the sense that seeing it in trailers did at least pique a lot of interest. But, somehow he thought that his asinine plot would somehow validate all the reverse footage enough to keep it intriguing, and sellable? Absolutely not.By the time you're 45 minutes into the movie you realize you're simply caught in someone's really bad idea that just doesn't work. So, how can the film cover all this up? Apparently by giving the movie as big of a cast as possible, and making sure that each cast member is from a different part of the world, in order to make the movie feel more worldly, and thus by default, more sophisticated. Then, we consistently place these characters in the largest, most obscure vehicles or machines that we can possibly get our hands on, in situations that physically present very high stakes, but otherwise leaves the viewer asking ""wait, why are they here though? Like, why are they doing this right now?"", and then blow up as much stuff as possible. EXPLOSIONS, MAN. But, none of it works - no matter how big the boat is, or how big the explosion is, no one's going to care or feel a thing if the plot and the film's characters are so insanely vapid. And that is precisely the case here.I recall a lot of people complaining about the audio in this movie, that they ""couldn't hear what they were saying"". I honestly believe that's because the dialogue is so useless, so void of all relativity & void of all humanity, that their brains were actually just blocking the information from being processed because it was such waste. Subconscious filters at work, if you will.I appreciate a good ambitious, original movie in this day and age, but holy lord, this is simply not cinema to me. It's a wank fest through and through. No story, no characters, no movie. It's gotta be my least favorite Christopher Nolan movie. Definitely my least favorite movie of 2020. I would say avoid at all costs.",Tenet

Putting the circumstances aside, 'Tenet' is a franken-film that tries to incorporate so many elements of past films that it ends up feeling like a hollow shell of what it should be.In a nutshell, 'Tenet' is a cross between a modern James Bond journey and Nolan's own 'Inception,' trying to capture mind-bending magic as a sci-fi spy thriller. The director's signature style is apparent throughout the entire film - from the heart-pounding symphony scene at the very beginning to the visually-impressive travels through time that the Protagonist (John David Washington) finds himself and others in. As with any Nolan film, the plot appears to be some extravagant concept, but when boiled down to basics, it's really not as complex as it's made out to be. We get the whole ""guy is tasked with saving the world"" storyline, and even though we're asked to empathize with characters like the wife of a Russian oil oligarch named Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), everyone feels so cold and distant.Sure, people will say the masses are not smart enough to understand 'Tenet.'

You will be lost earlier than know it while trying to figure out what the hell is going on here, but that's the beauty of ""Tenet"". Don't try to figure out the plot during the movie, do that afterwards. ""Tenet"" is a mind game and no one could do it better than Chris Nolan. This film is beautifully shot, terrifically acted and the action is full throttle. John David Washington continues to impress in this complex role and Robert Pattinson delivers sharpness and humour in his terrific performance. Elizabeth Debicki is great and the iconic Kenneth Branagh plays a damn good villain who's obsessed with his Fitbit (keep an eye on that detail). Ludwig Goransson's score is trendy and powerful, a perfect match for this film. You'll most probably never get the answers you're looking for while watching this film but there's no doubt that Nolan is a master of his craft. I'm looking forward to seeing ""Tenet"" again and probably again after that, just to see things I missed the first time around (yes, it's one of those movies).

199,kgprophet,Has the Nolan formula finally burned out?,6,4 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan has a formula for action films to keep you paying attention. It is similar to what classical composers would do. Every so often during a symphony, they would add a loud passage to make sure the audience was awake. In the case for Nolan, he would throw in a punchy moment of action every so often to keep the adrenaline rush going.This worked in spades in ""The Dark Knight"". Remember when there was some expository dialogue in the mayor's office and BAM!, a dead guy in a batman outfit slams against the glass. That kind of loud and abrupt moment catches your attention. Oooh! Something new happened! That formula requires something new and interesting to happen every minute or so. Which seems ridiculously a lot. And it is. But as long as that new thing posed some new interest regarding the story (Our villain is also a victim!), the train's firebox gets fed another shovel full of coal.This also worked well for Inception, where the audience was willing to invest their curiosity in the world of invading other people's dreams. The layering of plots went along with the layering of dream-within-a-dream in such a way that we could keep track of what was going on.However, for Tenet, the next exciting plot point becomes hard to follow sometimes. It is a twist on the time travel concept that I was barely able to keep up with. And I am an enthusiast in the concept of understanding the metaphysics of time. It is my understanding that there is a device that can flip the flow of time, and you can travel backwards in time (in real time) while the world around you still flows forward.It is a neat enough concept to be for a potentially intriguing movie. But I think it was not exploited enough. There is a brief introduction to the concept near the beginning of the film, one fight scene in the middle, and then a more extended use of the concept at the end. So there is a major chunk of the film, primarily in the middle, where we set aside all the science fiction aspects of the plot.What we get instead is a globe trotting adventure that smoothly, James Bond style, jumps from one exotic location to the next, for seemingly no other reason than to have an interesting backdrop while propelling the story. But in the meantime, the plot thickens to the degree that one starts to lose track of what's going on. And I was paying attention. For some reason the concept set forth in Inception was explained well enough, or perhaps kept to few enough layers, to keep track of what was going on. I think one problem with ""Tenet"", is that there is a need to keep the dialogue about what's going on more subtle, which is honorable. But unlike Inception, either too much convolution is going on, or it needed to be explained a little better. I think the former more that the latter.Our supporting characters continue to evolve, almost to the point we are in a different movie than we started with. Even more so when with some of the moments are revisited (via the time travel angle). So, even though the runtime on Nolan movies typically go well over two hours, the quick pace and steady flow of action makes up for it. In this case, however, the big third act feels like it arrives late.This movie was the first time I had been in a movie theater in about 8 months. It was a strange feeling (the showing I went to was a matinee and there were only a handful of people there). But more so, it was the sterile feeling about everything that made it feel less like going out to the movies that in the past. It was kind of too bad that the first movie I watched wasn't a hit out of the ballpark.As much as this movie invites us to rewatch the film to catch the nuances perhaps missed in the first viewing, I am reluctant to do so until I am ready to sit through this long and complicated event film.",Tenet
200,eagandersongil,A visual spectacle and a driving tragedy,7,13 November 2020,"""Tenet"" is a cluster of good ideas with a tiring and confused execution. It seems that Nolan first thought of the scenes and visuals and then thought of a script, which is just a justification for the director to prove to the audience how good a filmmaker he is when it comes to the artistic direction of his work and practical effects.
We do not have an established morality, perhaps a thought about the consequences of the future and the past but that simply do not work or pass through, we see a hint of ""The origin"" in the course of the work, in its ambition to create a grand script and visual spectacle of the scenes and we also feel many characteristics of the film ""The arrival"", mainly in its narrative, moral and even scenes style, but without the same success of Denis Villeneuve's feature.Nolan signs the script alone, which is the great sin of the film, because in addition to the complex being, its narrative structure and editing do not favor it at all, and the Twister plot does not excite, the good part is due to the technical aspect which is excellent, starting with the great action scenes, very well directed, tense and exciting together with a fantastic soundtrack and as always in Nolan's films, a terrifyingly present mixing and editing, the long shots are very well used and the production design of the work in general is great.John David is great as a protagonist, the actor looks like us throughout the work, always confused waiting for the solution, Robert Pattisson is also fine, playing an ambiguous character and that leaves us with a backward moment at all times and Elizabeth convinces how a broken character looking for a fresh start, Kenneth Branagh is a great actor but the figuration and script of his villain is extremely cartoonish and empty, his villain andrei is a typical antagonist of 007.Tenet fits like a good action film, nothing more, its grand script doesn't work and its driving even less, I like complex and dubious films, but tentent it seems like it has nothing to discover, it's just a big empty box with great scenes. 7/10",Tenet
201,akshatmahajan,Nolan's most confusing.....,8,13 December 2020,"TENET is Nolan's most confusing movie. Even more confusing than his INTERSTALLER. It is necessary to watch it twice, preferably with subtitles. But one main thing is that you must watch it in cinemas as cinema experience is lit. You may not enjoy it at home/ mobile.The story (without time concept) was very simple but with time concept, the story was so much complex and interesting. This movie gives you enough for discussion and will enjoy discussing it.Overall, do watch it (most preferably in cinemas) and discuss it with your friends (who have watched it).",Tenet
202,dr_clarke_2,The sort of high-brow modern-day cinematic spectacle that Nolan fans have come to expect,10,24 January 2021,"Released in 2020 after three delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenet is the latest (at the time of writing) big budget science fiction thriller from Christopher Nolan, who wrote the screenplay as well as directing. Despite being co-produced in the UK and USA, it feels very much like a modern Hollywood spectacle, but it nevertheless boasts the high-brow approach that Nolan fans have come to expect.
Tenet follows an otherwise-unnamed Protagonist who works for the CIA but becomes embroiled with the eponymous organisation and finds himself pitted against Russian arms dealer Andrei Sator. Sator has access to technology from the future, which allows people and objects to move backwards in time; dying and embittered, Sator is seeking the components of a physical realisation of an algorithm that will allow him to destroy the world. Nolan's plot dabbles with quantum physics as well as time travel and is possibly nonsensical, but he gets away with it through sheer verve. The labyrinthine plot is enormously satisfying and it helps that the film has as much in common with James Bond films as it does with science fiction, providing a relentless onslaught of high-octane thrills, stunts and fight sequences.
It works, and it works well. Tenet is indeed thrilling and features a winning combination of both effective characterisation and a great cast. John David Washington makes an impressive and charismatic lead as the Protagonist, whilst Kenneth Branagh, an actor capable of considerable ham, gives a superb, restrained and menacing performance as Sator, a violent psychopath who checks his own pulse after beating a man to death with a gold ingot. Robert Pattinson continues to shake off the brooding vampire cliché he played in the Twilight saga as foppish handler Neil, whilst Hindi film star Dimple Kapadia is very good as an unlikely arms dealer and Elizabeth Debicki convinces as Kat, who occupies the ""Bond girl"" role of Sator's estranged and abused wife. This being a Nolan film, aging Cockney knight Sir Michael Caine crops up, this time as aging Cockney knight Sir Michael Crosby.
Visually, Tenet is just as stunning as Nolan's previous science fiction films Inception and Interstellar. Filmed on location in seven different countries and with hundreds of extras, this is old-school cinematic spectacle, with stunning cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, flawless special effects and a vast scale. The scene with the stolen aeroplane is a visual feast, as is the lengthy car chase. With Nolan's regular collaborator Hans Zimmer unavailable, Ludwig Göransson composes the soundtrack, which occasionally has a fractured discordance that reflects the interrupted flow of time.
Science fiction always draws a dedicated following, and Tenet is exactly the sort of science fiction that obsessive fans will analyse and debate for years; with a multitude of influences inspiring the story from Sator squares to theoretical physics (Kip Thorne, who worked with Nolan on Interstellar, again acted as consultant) there is plenty here to digest. But you don't have to be a science fiction fan to enjoy this heady blend of action, great acting and winning characterisation: Tenet succeeds just as well as an example of hugely entertaining filmmaking.",Tenet
203,nicorip22,Boring movie,4,17 March 2021,"Honestly, I find this movie a bit boring, it doesn't seem like a big deal to me, disappointing.",Tenet
204,fciocca,"Unnecessarily complicated, way too long. Very disappointed considering all the hype generated during last months",5,30 August 2020,"I had big expectations for Tenet, since I first watched the trailer. Instead, the movie is very confusing and maybe in order to understand it, I need to watch it more than once. I managed to follow halfway through it, but then I was completely lost. Except the main two characters Neil and The Protagonist, the rest of the cast is pretty flat and Kat is really annoying, especially towards the end. At least actors were good enough to maintain the whole thing afloat.From a technical perspective the movie is good, and there are a few good scenes here and there, but I would say that special effects were cheap and lazy. I mean, from a visionary director such as Nolan I wasn't expecting for sure a bunch of reversed clips. The ending had no sense at all and you cannot actually understand what is happening.If this is the movie that was supposed to relaunch cinemas, after the lockdown period, well, I suggest to look elsewhere. Tenet is unoriginal and uninspired, Nolan already made movies about space and time such as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", so I think that in this case he could have change the topic.A real pity. Movie's definitely too long and there are many stretched out sequences and useless story lines. Instead of deepening some details, which could actually make understand something about what's happening. I suggest to give it a try, but do not expect a masterpiece.",Tenet
205,Puroo,Too complicated for even Nolan to handle,7,1 April 2021,"Christopher Nolan has done movies explaining concepts of space (Interstellar), dreams (Inception) and society (The Dark Knight Trilogy). This time he made a movie on time. Although I like the fact that he made a movie about time travellers which is nothing like what we would have done if we were given a chance, it wasn't done properly. A lot of people who are writing praises for this movie are accusing the critics of not being able to understand the concept of the movie. It's not that people don't understand the concept; sometimes the rules of the universe are established and then they themselves are not being followed.Think about it. If suppose someone is being shot. So they get hit with the bullet and then they bleed. Simple, right? Now think of this in reverse. They will have to stop bleeding and then the bullet will pass through them. But in this movie they bleed AFTER the bullet passes through them, as though their blood is being affected by the reverse bullet. It would have made sense if this was said at some point but it isn't. I'm giving the example of the gunfire because that's about half the scenes in this movie. The car chase scenes, however, were done absolutely correctly. The sailing of the ships, the explosions, the part where The Protagonist meets himself, everything was done in absolute perfection.There were many times when the movie brought up things that were never talked about later. The movie began with a scene about an anti-terror squad to show the protagonist. But this was never brought up ever again. They said they need to have committed an act for the positive entropy to work, but most of the times they don't do those acts, especially in the fight scenes or the ending when Kat shoots Sator. Neil is said to have come from the future, but he doesn't act in reverse the way other people from the future do.Filmmaking should always follow the rule of ""show, don't tell"", which this movie had to continuously violate because of how complicated it was. This is a movie that was too complex even for Christopher Nolan, such that even the ordinary audience can easily pinpoint the mistakes. He bit a lot bigger than he could chew. Let's hope the next time he makes a movie that is complex to look at but easy to grip over like how Inception or The Dark Knight were.",Tenet
206,Med-Jasta,"I hate to say see it twice, but...",10,2 May 2021,"It's true. I watched it two days ago and wrote a review, which is my thoughts after watching it once. I watched it again and my thoughts on the movie changed. I had to write a new review to reflect my changed opinion. I kept the first review here to show just how different a second viewing it. If you want to hear what I actually think just jump to the second review.First watch:I had heard a lot about this movie from everyone that I know. And they all said it was awful and that you couldn't understand anything. Not only did I have to judge for myself because I often differ from the masses but it's Nolan.I was super into it at first. I didn't know what people were talking about. And I could understand every word! Of course the mix was messed up. There was too much distance between the dialogue and everything else. I was straining to hear them and sometimes couldn't make it out and then judging by the next thing said figured out what was said.The plot was set up with the chick and the rock and that was great. And then the kitchen fight happened and I thought I was in the clear for a great movie. But then everything slowly became more confusing and kinda dumb.I'm not sure if they ever explain how the bad guy can do this? I'm not sure why his death means the obliteration of the entire world. Why his watch will do that. And his motivation to destroy the planet because he's going to die was so so so stupid. And I have no idea what that hole at the end was.The whole traveling backwards and forwards thing never really made sense. Every time I made sense of it something would happen and I was like, ""Wait how does this work?"" I think Nolan thought seeing stuff happen backwards was way cooler than we did. The hallway fight was cool but by the time you get to the giant battle at the end (for some reason) it lost its wow factor and just became annoying and kept reminding me that it didn't make any sense.Yes even the backwards music got old pretty quickly. I kept asking myself, ""Why are they doing this?"" Also the wife killing her husband before she was supposed to, which meant Earth's annihilation, and she does it anyway but it works out was stupid. It felt like, especially towards the end that things were happening just for suspense and not for logic.It was so dumb and cliche that the main character set this all in motion. Does every time travel movie have to do something like this? Is it a rule?And this is the first time I've ever heard myself complaining about this but the main character was nothing. There was nothing about him. I couldn't tell you anything about what he was like. I have no impression of his character. I don't need a backstory or some arc or explanation of motivation but he had literally no characterization. He did nothing that gave him any kind of personality or anything.The faults here are excusable because Nolan is always flirting with this anyway. His movies always have some level of confusion but are explained. This time he just went too far. I don't know if he's too in his world where no one tells him what's wrong or if he is getting out of touch with the audiences perception. Dunkirk had the same problems for me. I didn't like that one at all. But at least this one I enjoyed the ride and only didn't like it until the last half an hour or so.I hope Nolan learns from this and has a few honest friends read his script first or something. Every director has hit and misses and he definitely has earned the right to have a few misses. I just hope Tenet isn't the beginning of the end for the greatest director around right now. Because we need him. And without him there's no one else.Second watch:Something about this movie hadn't left my mind. I just couldn't get it out of my head. And while I had heard people say you gotta watch it twice, I didn't care. I don't think a movie should be viewed twice to understand it. I still do. But Tenet was so enjoyable on the first viewing and I liked everything other than what I didn't understand. So two days later I decided to try it out with my hand on the remote ready to shut it off and watch something else. At first it wasn't a whole lot different. People made it sound like you were seeing a whole new movie the second time. But then in the first scene I realized that Neil was in the opening scene. That was new. And that was just the beginning. Things like that don't really happen it's more of having a base knowledge of what is happening helps. Because when they explain stuff you don't become lost. You already have an idea so you can keep up with the explanation. Because the first time I felt like I understood what was happening after a scene but there so much other exposition happened that the knowledge I had just learned but pushed out by this new information.The biggest difference was Sator. I understood this time that the people from the future wanted to destroy the world, not him. But that he was okay with it because he was going to die anyway. And I got that the hole in the cave was where he received things from the future. And that he was going to destroy the hole so they couldn't get the alga rhythm. And that the people from the future wanted to destroy the past so that the horror's of the time travel couldn't happen. And the fact that the main character's didn't understand the technology made lines like, ""Don't try to understand it,"" much easier. That wasn't a writers trick, (Maybe it was) but the people in the story didn't understand the war that they were fighting but they were still fighting it. This time I understood that this was Terminator meets James Bond. And the reason his watch is set up to set off the device is because that was the mission he was going to carry out anyway. And the fact that he was chosen was because he was in Russia cleaning up after that nuclear spill or whatever. And that's what powers the time travel technology. It all made sense this time. Before I thought that he had like a super power to make time travel happen or something.I realized that my understanding of the plot weakened the further the plot went along too. Because I was missing the building blocks to understand the next step. Much like I did in high school math. Because all my confusion gradually built in the movie. I got the ending this time and the whole technique they had. I can't remember the name. Where one group does half of the mission and then informs the past about it. I didn't know what the hell was going on at the end and I got it this time. I could see all the little forwards and backwards things that were happening.People talk about the volume being too low, which it is, but I think the character's with thick accents were the hardest to understand and would have been at full volume. And that the dialogue is so loaded with exposition that it was hard to hear because it was hard to understand and keep up. So those little moments where you asked yourself, ""What did he say?"" could be figured out but but the you had missed half of a sentence which was crucial to the plot. I don't know if it was Nolan's intent or not but I found that the quiet dialogue really grabbed my attention so I didn't miss it. Don't watch this movie while eating pork rinds. Or maybe the story was so enthralling. You should be able to clearly hear the dialogue, there's no way around that. Because whenever people have masks on it's very challenging. I know Nolan hates ADR, he maybe he just didn't do it this time? I don't know. But there's no reason or excuse good enough to make the dialogue hard to hear.And since I enjoyed the hell out of it this time all those little things that I really didn't like were only minor nuances. The girl killing Sator at the end early was still dumb. I guess it was there to create suspense that the world was going to be destroyed? I don't know. But this time it was minor. The main character is nothing but it's not really a big deal. I'm not sure if it's the writing or John David Washington. He was kinda flat. But I think he was supposed to be this way. Since this is the only movie I have seen him in I won't judge him off of it. The end where Neil tells him that Washington sent him back seemed a little on the nose but it wasn't too bad this time. He sent Neil to help, it's not like the whole plot was because of him. Like Terminator where John Connor needs to be killed but the guy that comes back to save Sarah Connor is impregnated by him? So how does that work? Time travel movies love to do that kind of stuff. Of course I love Terminator. Duh.I don't know if a longer edit of this movie would help or it's just the dialogue. I think some breather scenes would have helped. But I also liked how fast it was. It must be hard when you write, shoot, edit and then mix something to get if people are going to hear it. Because after all those steps you can't divorce yourself from wondering if you can hear it. No matter what you know what's being said. But is there any other movie that has this problem? Nolan needs to get his ears out of his ass or something. His techniques and style are starting to become a little familiar I must say. His movies all kinda have the same style and I hope he doesn't get stuck in this. Even some of the camera angles were the same as other movies.My favorite part was the kitchen fight. When he slashes the guy with the cheese grater and the guitar riff is playing was pure cinema as Hitchcock would say. That's one of the reasons I watched it again. I at least wanted to watch that part. My conclusion is that if you were like me and liked the movie but also didn't, to watch it again and I think you'll understand the movie like it was the first time. And if you hated every second of it, don't bother. And everybody come on, get a good sound system.",Tenet
207,DeBBss,If Only I Had Ten More Brain Cells...,7,9 January 2021,"A lot of the audience members of Tenet have complained that Tenet is too confusing to enjoy, and that's what unfortunately makes Tenet so unenjoyable at times for me. I already knew that Tenet was supposed to be confusing when going into the movie, so I tried my best to focus and listen, and yet I still got confused. There's a lot of different timelines going on with mashing sub plots, and the film didn't do a great job at explaining everything. Maybe it's just me, but the film was just really hard to follow. I even watched an explanation video, and that was even confusing. The plot is just really complex, and even though I couldn't really follow it the whole time, I still appreciated it because of how smart and deep it is.Aside from the plot, everything is near perfect. The inverted fight scenes were crazy in the best ways possible. There were times where I was just blown away by some of the scenes, and I questioned how Christopher Nolan filmed it Tenet is the first of its kind, and the fact that Christopher Nolan nailed it, I think he deserves some awards for that.Tenet is a really solid movie. With good performances from the actors, great action scenes, amazing direction, and an extremely complex and mind-blowing plot. Tenet deserves nothing less than a 7/10. And if you're going into this film for the first time, then prepare to awake the sixth sense, because this film will destroy every last brain cell.",Tenet
208,W011y4m5,It's all ideas.,8,2 December 2020,"Tenet's main flaw is it simply isn't long enough; for a film as audacious as this, biting off far more than it can chew in a meager 2 hours & 30 minutes, it's clear Christopher Nolan (despite being one of the most remarkable filmmakers working in the industry at the moment) had an impossible task on his hands. However, that doesn't stop him from boldly trying & despite its pacing issues / questionable editing, he still manages to make a phenomenal movie - which is a triumph in both storytelling & technical filmmaking - boasting some truly extraordinary cinematography from long time collaborator, Hoyte Van Hoytema, who captures images with such effectiveness, it's hard not to be impressed by the accomplished result from their $225m attempt.However, this is a project - more than most - which is yearning for an extended director's cut. Emphasizing the point, it frankly necessitates one - that could easily boost its box office numbers if it's re-released in theatres once the pandemic has finally concluded. The vast majority of issues with the feature stem from the fact that characters are severely underdeveloped & scenes are constantly rushing from one set piece to another - with little connective tissue between the sequences to help hold them together. Hence, considering the sheer amount of vital information / exposition Nolan needed to remain in his blockbuster - in order for it to make narrative sense, it's not hard to believe those quieter, character driven moments would've been the first to fall on the cutting room floor, providing extra time for Chris to explore the scientific / philosophical theories he aimed to tackle instead - accounting for the lack of strong foundations in terms of both character & emotional engagement. Adding those back in would undoubtedly improve its quality.However, I fail to sympathise with those who proclaimed they didn't get it or couldn't hear anything... Growing up watching time travel shows like Doctor Who & having fascinated over concepts like free will / causality, this seemed pretty familiar in that regard - so despite its convoluted-ness, the intricacies are detailed enough for people to comprehend - as long as they bother to pay close attention. As for the sound, no complaints either.",Tenet
209,saraccan,A single gimmick movie,6,10 October 2020,"It's as if they came up with an idea to build the movie on and just ran with it. This is what this movie is. A single gimmick movie. It's like a baby of his previous movies; Inception (another single gimmick movie, not that its bad), Memento (timeline moving forwards and backwards) and Interstellar (butchering the dialogue mix). If this film was called Mission Impossible: Time Protocol (or something along those lines) starring Tom Cruise it would just be considered a decent spy/action movie which is what it is.If you have to see the movie 3 times to able to unravel its boring and messy story like that drawer you have full of cables, that doesn't make it a smart movie. And even if you like the idea of trying to unravel complex stories, there have been many movies in the past that did this without needing a billion dollar budget (Primer).I do have to give credit to cool fighting and car chasing scenes though. Very impressive.A bad Russian guy who has a bad weapon is trying destroy the world while the good guys try to stop him from being a bad husband.",Tenet

211,x_manicure_x,Nolan's Bond movie,6,14 August 2021,"""Tenet"" is yet another Christopher Nolan blockbuster that shows off intriguing ideas and spectacular action, but unfortunately struggles at telling an emotionally engaging story. I dig the dark tone and ambitious scale of his films, but always find it hard to connect with the paper-thin characters. Neil might be the only exception here, but it felt like credit should go to Robert Pattinson for his performance. Overall, I quite enjoyed it, and can totally see myself revisiting it a few years from now, but at the same time, I can't help feeling like it was in many aspects also a missed opportunity.Even more than ""Inception"", the film can be described as a more daring take on a James Bond flick. The problem is that Nolan has always been awkward with two of the vital trademarks of a successful 007 film: wit and sensuality. The humor was a bit better than usual, though.Despite its reputation as a tremendously convoluted film, the plot is as simple as ""Avengers: Infinity War"": the bad guy is collecting powerful artifacts that could lead to the destruction of the universe, and a group of heroes travels across time to stop him. The only thing to be really confusing is the way time travel is handled. There is no machine that instantly takes you to a particular point in time: you have to ""invert"" yourself and physically walk your way backward, with the whole world around you appearing as it is ""rewinding"" itself. This results in action sequences that are as visually breathtaking as they are mechanically overwhelming, particularly when you get to see characters moving in opposite temporal directions interact on screen. When it's a couple of characters you can more or less figure out what is going on, but when we are talking about color-coded troops, it gets a bit too much for your eyes to handle.",Tenet

Director: Christopher Nolan
Starring: John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth Debicki etcOverall rating 97/100
Armed with only one word, Tenet. A protagonist must fight with the help of some friends along the way from stopping the whole worlds past and everyone with it being destroyed, but technology called inversion found from the future poses a threat like nobody has ever seen before. Wow what a masterpiece Tenet on so many levels especially visually and creatively one of the best and most unique movies I have seen, let's discuss this in more detail.First of all, the film's cinematography and set pieces were truly phenomenal. Tenets cinematography was truly one of the best I have ever seen in a movie, it was just like other Nolan movies visually captivating, but somehow he managed to achieve another level of visual creativity, with so many different shots and visual elements that I had never seen before and that genuinely left me amazed with what I was watching, it just made you get lost in this new world. The set pieces for this movie were also fantastic, I loved how big this movie went, there was so many world travelling locations with different cultures and set pieces that it added even more visual creativity and appeal to the movie with the movie also having a variety of different characters from different backgrounds and cultures as well which was great and added a good amount of inclusivity and just made the film feel grander in scale.My next few positives would be the action, score, and clever plot. The films plot was one of the most clever and creative things I have had the pleasure of watching, the thought of reversing time or the ability to change the past has never been done in this way before or with so much thought, was It fairly complicated to follow at times, yes but once you understand it, you can just like me really appreciate the creativity and artistry behind the plot of the movie. The action was also fantastic, due to the creativity of reversing time this added to the entertainment of the action sequences, it was so nice to get unique action instead of the generic constant explosions, the fact that characters were often moving in different directions or seeing the aftermath of an action scene before it even happened was just incredible to watch and left me consistently entertained. The score was also one of my favourite parts of the movie. The movies soundtrack was truly captivating, whenever there was a big action scene or big reveal the score exploded into action and it just made the film so much more entertaining and made the viewing experience so much better and with the sound quality at the cinema there was no better way to see a movie of this scale.My only slight nit-pick that stopped the movie from being perfection for me was the lack of depth to the main character. For me the fact that John David Washington's character never really had a name or that we never really knew anything about him apart from the basic role within the film was a slight issue for me, it would have been nice if the character work had the same consistent amount of attention to detail then the movies creativity with it's plot and visual elements.My next few positives would be the script, performances, humour, and great villain. The script for Tenet was so masterfully crafted it blew my mind. Every single little detail was thought out and linked together perfectly and so cleverly it all just made sense by the end. I also really liked the jumbled way the story was told making it even more enjoyable putting the pieces together as they were further revealed. I also thought the performances here were excellent, from everybody which was nice to see. Kenneth Branagh delivered a surprisingly tense and intimidating performance which I wasn't expecting from him but he played the villain extremely well, you never knew what he was up to, and he knew every move of the characters making him a very threatening villain and genuinely making me question whether he would win or not. Elizabeth Dubecki did a fantastic job, she made the character one of the most connectable and her versatility with her emotions when acting made you empathise with her character well. The two main performances from John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were also brilliant. Both had heaps of charm and charisma when watching and were fantastic leads, with John David Washington especially putting everything into his performance. The film was also quite funny as well, the banter between Pattinson and Washington's character as well as the villain was great, with some great one liners and sarcastic humour that landed well.My final few positives would be the tense tone, plot twists and fantastic final act. The movie managed to execute a surprisingly good tense tone, it was a mixture of all sorts of things, the fantastic villain and not knowing whether the main characters were going to succeed was a big factor, but also the movie kept you on your toes not knowing what was going to happen in each scene, therefore for me leaving me on edge a lot of the time. The plot twists were also fantastic, they were so excellently set up, you never saw them coming until they were shown on screen, which is great as so often big blockbusters go for very predictable plot twists that you can see coming from a mile off, but not in this case, these plot twists genuinely shocked me and pieced a lot of the puzzle together for the movie. And finally Tenets final act has to be one of the most entertaining piece of cinema I have seen. I was never bored, with the combination of what made the movie so fantastic, with going all out with the visuals, action, performance and just pure cleverness, everything pieced together perfectly leaving me very satisfied with the end result with the stakes of the plot being extremely high.Overall Tenet is another masterpiece from Tenet, who has made yet another movie that stands on it's, with it's own uniqueness and creativity. Showing some of the best visuals, action and plot's you will see and definitely deserving of a safe but fun trip back to the cinema.",Tenet
213,shanayneigh,Dull,2,19 December 2020,"I love Nolan's films, but this was absolutely dreadful. We get it, you're obsessed with playing around with time. Yes, yes, you're so smart for filming what is essentially a Chinese puzzle box.The story is tiny and quite disappointing. Things happen with zero context or connective tissue. It's just mindless and dull spectacle. I'm sure they were hoping that the ""mysterious"" events or characters (the savior in the opera scene, the woman diving off the boat, the masked man in black clothes during the Norway heist) would be revealed with great fanfare later on, but they were painfully obvious as they happened. There are some good visuals, but not the outstanding ones we have come to expect from Nolan. I felt absolutely nothing for the characters. Denzel Washington's kid couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.40 minutes into the movie I took a look at my watch hoping it would end soon, but by then there were almost two hours left.Very underwhelming movie.This is the first Nolan movie that I have no desire to ever see again.",Tenet
214,gavinp9,Another masterpiece from the best director going round,8,23 August 2020,"'Tenet' is great. And that's not just because I finally saw a film in the cinema again! It's definitely not a ""time travel"" movie - it's a fast-paced, layered the-whole-world's-at-stake spy film, with some added mind-bending ""inversion"" included. For mine, this is better than 'Interstellar' & 'Dunkirk', but not quite the greatness of 'Inception' or 'The Prestige'. Still, Nolan's bar is so high, and this ticks so many boxes.The first 5min are so hectic and unrelenting, and rather than taking some time to pause and fill us in, the plot moves briskly as we follow the Protagonist (Washington - what a beard!) as he teams up with Neil (Pattinson) and are left to fill in some of the gaps - which I appreciate - rather than have them spoon fed to us. We then figure out how the villain (Branagh) - wish he had a better motivation - & his unwilling wife Kat (Debicki) fit in, as they do a Bond-esque globe-trotting - India, Estonia, Norway, England, Italy.Reminds me of 'Recursion' (by Blake Crouch) which I just read, but still a very unique take on the spy genre. Action galore, car chases, high stakes, exceptional score, and some truly amazing cinematography. Some of the ""inverse"" fight scenes and car stunts are extraordinary. It's all helped by how likeable and assured Washington is as the lead. Some of it's a bit confusing, but there's no time wasted getting into physics ""what-ifs"". Long-ish at 2.5 hours, but it whips by.",Tenet
215,thebricks,Christopher Nolan needs to end the pseudointellectual act,1,10 October 2020,"Tenet basically was a confirmation of all of my concerns about Christopher Nolan's approach to moviemaking. He doesn't make movies for people to enjoy; he makes movies to confuse people. All of his movies are a giant shell game.The easiest thing in the world for someone to do is confuse them. It is incredibly easy to ask difficult questions. It's much harder to entertain people. Christopher Nolan doesn't want to entertain; he wants to make movies to prove that he is intelligent. After twenty or so years, he still doesn't think he's proven it enough to everyone.Let's be honest about Nolan's inspiration for this movie; he thought making a movie about videos set in reverse was cool and wanted to find a reason to center a film around this. None of it was entertaining nor did it make any sense. It's a trash movie. You could see around the scene they stepped into the time machine or whatever it was that they lost the plot. It was a contrived mess after that. If someone had $20 for Advil in the theater I watched it in, I would have paid it.It's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted like this. John David Washington has a bright future ahead of him but it was sad to see him starring front and center in a trash film like this that could ruin his career. Robert Pattinson, once again, bad choice of film that will also hurt his career. He needs to cut his hair if he wants to be taken seriously. Everything about him screams IT guy, not movie star. Elizabeth Debicki, loved her as always, would run away with her in 30 seconds flat if she asked me, but she's gotta take better films than this. She's also getting typecast too and needs to do something risky.I have to be honest, in a normal year, I think Tenet would have flopped. Word of mouth would have been bad and it would have been destroyed by the competition. Because it's pretty much the only game in town, it's dominated. It very well may be one of the last films to be released until better fare comes out next year. Everything is being delayed or brought to streaming. Something has to give. I hope Christopher Nolan reevaluates himself after this movie and comes back with something better in his next project. This film was a bit of a mess. He can do better and I would suggest doing movies with a good script and a relatable plot instead of trying to confuse people in an attempt to prove he is an intellectual.",Tenet
216,solidabs,Wow,1,14 September 2020,I'm so out of touch with you Hollywood wierdos. I dont even know who Cris Nolan is. But it's hard to believe this clown ever made a good movie. This movie was just horrible. I feel sorry for people who paid for this nonsense. Lmao,Tenet
217,henrycoles9,Not as expected,7,4 May 2021,"This was probably the first Christopher Nolan movie that I couldn't love outright straight away. It was too complex to be as fun as it ought to. Nolan should get credit for this new innovation, however. The story, time travel of the well-known infinity loop kind, is not new, but what's new is that there are multiple infinity loops within the big loop as well as inversion of time. That is, time travel doesn't occur as simply as it used to in previous time travel movies. Rather, it's based on time-inverting people and objects onto the past and then reverting them back so they could act normally. I think that's why it's not as fun as I'd expected. It's our first encounter with this kind of time travel stories.",Tenet

Ingenious.
Quality.
Entertaining
Spectacular.
The effects are spectacularly done, as well as the action scenes and the stunts.
The script is fascinating.
The performances at the level.
It's one of those movies where you have to carefully see how everything Nolan does to make you understand him or you're going to get lost, you shouldn't even blink.
The only problem is that it uses the same formula in sequences and opening as in the Batman trilogy and it doesn't look as groundbreaking anymore.

This is enough to make a bad film.But it's way worse than that. Tenet is awfully difficult to follow, with absolutely no pay-off. It's just an autistic mind trip with no reason.The characters are one dimensional. The sub-plots are annoying, unnecessary, and almost impossible to follow in real-time.Pack this with top notch cinematography (that earn my 2 stars), unbearable music, hysteric editing and the overall hermeticism, and you have the most pretentious piece of moviemaking in the last decade (ok, Dunkirk was worse, but you get it).Last but not least, some pathetic dialogues about love and free will cement this as the perfect decoy for the wannabe movie critics.",Tenet
221,MogwaiMovieReviews,Tenable,6,3 December 2020,"I think I'm coming around to the realization that I can't really claim to be a fan of Christopher Nolan anymore.Three of his earlier films, Memento, The Dark Knight and The Prestige, are all masterpieces in my eyes, but ever since Inception, Nolan's films have tended towards the overlong, overblown, overcomplicated and incomprehensible. Tenet is no different: it's got a great idea to do with time travel, but it does nothing with it that hasn't been done much better before. There are moments and ideas in this film that are strongly reminiscent of earlier films such as Looper, 12 Monkeys, Back To The Future and Timecrimes, but completely stripped of the story and characters that made those films mean something. You don't and can't care about any of the characters in this film, so all you're left with is a good ""what if"" and a bunch of loud and explosive set-pieces that don't make any sense at all when you start to think about them.John David Washington is solid in the lead role, as a kind of unaffiliated black American James Bond - another series of films Tenet is strongly indebted to - but here again, stripped of the worldbuilding necessary to make it (kind of) believable, what we see is a guy we don't know anything about, starting off alone but uninhibitedly traveling the globe with seemingly limitless resources. You can kind of believe that MI6 have operatives everywhere around the world and money to burn in helping out James Bond. But here none of that is explained so it just seems like a lazy schoolboy fantasy of consequence-free impossible adventures.Although I do appreciate the scale of Nolan's vision, there has to be a meaningful story at the center of it all for it to be worth it, and I wish his next film would be a much more back-to-basics tale, with an ingenious premise but with the people at the center of it being the point of it all, rather than just cogs in a shiny, clanking, whirring but empty machine.",Tenet
222,Brooklynsmagicmike,Eh I didn't like it.,5,16 December 2020,This was one of biggest hyped movies of this year. It was literally promoted on everything and I couldn't wait to see it when it came out on dvd. I don't know what I expected but it wasn't that.The movie in my opinion was draggy and super confusing. Maybe if I watched it second time I would get it but it just doesn't have enough appeal for me to do it. The action was okay but it was by the numbers nothing I haven't seen done better before. Also the most annoying thing about the movie was the incositency in volume. Sometimes the movie was insanely loud others it was like mice were speaking. I don't know what was up with that at all.On the positive side I gave it stars because the visuals were absolutely stunning. Easyly some of the best I've ever seen. The actors did pretty good job with source material just wish this cast was in much better movie.I personally wouldn't recommend but maybe its just because it wasn't for me I diddn't like inception either and alot people loved that. This movie was very similiar to that for me.,Tenet

224,EvanKevelson,A myriad of metaphysical conundrums or something else (SPOLIERS),9,11 January 2021,"A review can't be written for the film that's meaningful without some Spoilers.
If you're not familiar with different concepts of theoretical physics, concepts and theories of time on an elementary level you'll get lost. If you get caught up with terminology like inversion and entropy you're doing yourself and the film Being a disservice.
Despite my headline I will give a very simple explanation of what is happening in this movie's Universe.
The Protagonist and everyone in the world though on different levels are in a time loop. When The protagonist realizes this the films events are inverted with some early scenes elaborated on, and towards the end events that are spoken about are put on Display. So I see no continuity problem at all but a story Told in events like an hourglass flipping over.
Unlike most great mysteries or suspense films that can only be enjoyed once...either do to the emphasis on the twist and revelation towards the end, what comes to mind ""12 Monkeys, and The Sixth Sense"",
This is highly entertaining espionage guided film dealing with Philosophical questions that come about in both theology Monotheism primarily, and in different arenas of Theoretical physics.
Questions like ""Is this one's first time living this life? Or is it happening over and over, and if it is is it a punishment or does something need to be rectified or both? If both than any recollection of previous journeys must be obliterated so free will can continue""
I found the film very entertaining, intellectually stimulating and not depressing, as well as amusing but not on a comical level. As per principle, minimal CGI, 35 mm, Sound that matches the tension or pressure of that moment I question some casting choices Typically like Tarantino and Scorsese when possible Mr. Nolan likes to reutilize certain actors in a large or minor role.
Christian Bale (Batman & Prestige), Anne Hathaway Batman & Interstellar, Michael Cain in Batman, Inception, Interstellar, had what I refer to as a cameo scene in Tenet, and was briefly just a radio voice in Dunkirk, in this film outside the Villain who was in Dunkirk there may have been too much of a change up.
Mr. Nolan has redefined the genre of Science Fiction/suspense/Fantasy as Scorsese did for Crime films, Sergio for Westerns and Americana, and Tarantino in story telling and catchy dialogue. Tarantino writes his movies, Scorsese's best are based with Artistic license on real events top 6 to me Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, The Aviator, The Departed, and Wolf of Wall Street.",Tenet
225,sriramthestranger,Mind blowing!!!,9,15 December 2020,"Christopher Nolan's Tenet is about a spy and a stranger fighting a much powerful antagonist, who can apparently play with time like a music player - forwards and backwards. But, what the Director forgot is the human brain cannot focus simultaneously two actions. That seems to be the problem with the movie - the editing could have been made in a more visually understandable manner. As I am a big fan of the game 'Duet' by Kumobius, it felt easy to focus on both the actions. Definitely, one of the best from Nolan on time concept after Inception and Interstellar!! Must watch!!",Tenet
226,CountJonnie,"Complex, but understandable",8,21 March 2021,"Complex because of the theory about the arrow of time. But you don't need to understand that theory completely to be able to understand the movie. The story is coherent enough, and the actors are good enough to keep you interested in their actions and motivations, so they drag you through this story. Another brilliant choice is to make this movie light on CGI.The only advice is to watch the movie twice because it literally has two layers, and so have the actors.",Tenet
227,movieman6-413-929510,Finally time for Tenet in the cinema.,8,27 August 2020,"Tenet is a new Sci-Fi action movie directed and written by Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk.In the movie, a CIA agent (John David Washington) is recruited by a secret organization called Tenet. Here he learns about a hidden cold war between America and Russia, which can influence time through new technologies. This way they can catch their bullets instead of firing them.
To prevent World War III, the CIA must stop Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), a renegade Russian oligarch. He has foreknowledge of how he can influence time with time inversion for bad and dangerous purposes. The CIA must also train with time inversion to avoid threats to the world.Christopher Nolan had the idea for Tenet in mind and planning for 20 years. He wrote the final script for the film in the past five years. In one of his first directed 2000 films Memento, Nolan also played with the subject of time. It is nice to see how Nolan now, after 20 years, processes the subject of time in a different way in his film. There are scenes in the movie that take place both forward and backwards. To convey these scenes properly, Nolan recorded each scene twice: once in progress and one where everything happens backwards.A fan of the James Bond film series, Nolan has incorporated the espionage genre into this film too, without copying ideas or story aspects from any of the James Bond films. Due to the mix of the espionage genre and the variation in time in the film, the film comes across as a modern, original mix between James Bond and Back to the Future.Christopher Nolan did not use a green screen or CGI for this film. All images were filmed on location and made with practical effects. The explosions and action scenes in the film are all real and credible. For this, they even crashed and exploded a real 747 plane in a hangar.The acting is also done well and credibly by the cast. The cast had to play all scenes both forward and back once. For this they also had to learn how to speak in reverse. Cast members were only allowed to go through the script in rooms so that no details of the films before the film's release could be shared with the world. Due to the corona pandemic, the film could not be released in theaters until months later, and all details and secrets of the film had to be well hidden from the world.Despite the fact that John David Washington largely goes through the film as characters without a name, he knows how to carry the film well as the main character. Together with Robert Pattinson they play a good spy duo, who research and investigate the art of time inversion. Elizabeth Debicki also plays well the wife of the villain's villain, with whom you don't always know if she can be trusted. Sometimes her character is written a bit too selfishly, which can irritate you if she seems to compromise the mission. Kenneth Branagh also plays the villain of the story well. Despite his character posing a threat to world peace, they have nevertheless given his character a good reason for his actions.",Tenet

229,madhukar30,"A movie fit for the year 2032, not 2020 !!",8,12 December 2020,"The beauty of Tenet lies in its complicated plot and a spectacular script. But having said that, frankly speaking I could only comprehend about 30% of what Christopher Nolan dished out on screen, on my first attempt. The more I tried hard to understand the movie, that harder it got. The various scenarios I put forth in my head in an attempt to decipher Tenet, considering my 3 decades of serious movies watching experience were of no use whatsoever.Tenet is a rare script that is far ahead of its time in many ways. The storyline and screenplay is like a brilliantly placed minefield in a strategically important forward position. Editing is in tune with the director's vision. Production design, Cinematography, costumes and makeup is on par with any of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Though Tenet is void of Hans zimmer's music, Ludwig Goransson's music takes off where Zimmer leaves. Casting is a touch let down, in fact a downgrade when compared to his earlier films. Acting levels again were too little off, when one compares Tenet to Nolan's previous films. I felt John David Washington looked a little raw in this movie void of any emotions.Overall, though I was only able to understand only 30% of the movie, scene to scene, I knew all along since it's a Nolan's movie I will watch it many times over the next decade to comprehend Tenet completely. Though Inception, Interstellar and Memento had its own set of complications but much of these movies were easy to understand. But Tenet is on a whole new level. It is definitely way ahead of its time.Out of the 30% that I could fathom, what I learnt was Tenet is more about Time inversion rather than a time travel movie. It doesn't matter Whether we like Tenet or hate it, kids in year 2055-2060 will see Tenet as how I saw 2001: A space oddesy in the early 2000s and will feel it with certain awe. Just enjoy the movie by not trying to understand it but to feel it. Cool stuff 7.8 stars out of 10.",Tenet

No when you rewatch it again and see how the scenes play out then it starts to make more sense and given that this is a movie about time there are repeated scenes that you see from other perspectives that you did not notice before played out different. But while tenant does try to have a more symbolic and philosophical meaning to it like inception it does not exactly flow the same way inception. few scenes do not add to anything even for what the film is trying to set up.,Tenet

Even Nolan's haters won't be able to criticize him on that as those action sequences are already meant to be references. In simpler words, Nolan topped himself in directing action sequences.When I said that Tenet is immense in scale, I meant it, it is shot in many countries, and it is almost on Dunkirk's level in terms of extras.All the elements pointed below brought us the most immersive film of 2020.

239,darkreignn,Spectacle for spectacles sake - and that's a good thing,8,3 October 2020,"Let's be honest. The audio in this movie wasn't even that hard to hear.""Tenet,"" or as most movie goers in America like to call it, ""Tenant,"" is the newest Christopher Nolan mind-bending action thriller. No doubt being compared to ""Inception,"" ""Tenet"" is a somehow more confusing, but equally as riveting film. With intense action, good acting throughout, and a compellingly interesting story, this is a movie that is worth risking COVID for.I've heard a lot of mixed things about ""Tenet"" before I risked death to watch it in theatres. I heard that it was overly long and lacking in character development. I heard that it was too confusing and harder to follow than Nolan's previous works. I heard that the audio was incomprehensible. But I also heard that it was filled to the brim with gorgeous visuals, a euphoric score, and compelling performances. And all of those things are true.The newest Nolan film is by no means the saviour of cinema that so many wanted it to be. However, it is incredibly good. In terms of action, ""Tenet"" has to be one of the most thrilling movies in years. My heart was pounding as hard and as fast as the drums that accompanied the action sequences. With zero shaky-cam, and almost everything filmed practically in-camera, it's impossible to say that this is a bad movie because of how good the violence was filmed. From an absolutely breathtaking hostage situation and shootout in an opera house to a high-stakes robbery that culminates in the very real explosion of an airplane (no CGI to be found there), the sheer amount of set pieces makes this movie, at the least entertaining and watchable. For me, that made up for the lack of relatable characters.It's true; ""Tenet"" has characters that are kept at arm's length, most definitely purposefully. But while the audience may never get to fully comprehend the complexities of each and every character, Nolan gives us enough to understand the motivations and follow the story, and the movie takes off from there. To me, that wasn't a bad thing. This film is based off its spectacle, and when you know that going in, you'll enjoy it in spades. But, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the infamous audio issues that so many others have criticized the movie for.Yes, there are points in the film where the background noise slightly drowns out the dialogue. This can make the already convoluted story even more difficult to follow. However, there was never a point in the movie where I could not understand the dialogue, so for me personally, I cannot mark this as a negative. What is a negative? As I mentioned, the overly convoluted story. I don't mind confusing storylines, but ""Tenet"" seems to take it a step too far, almost reveling in telling a story that it knows the audience will not be able to understand, at least not on the first viewing. However, for all of you fans of cerebral movie experiences, ""Tenet"" will no doubt satisfy.""Tenet"" may not be the most emotionally resonant movie of 2020, but what it lacks in emotion it makes up for in pure thrills. Think of this one as Nolan's 007. It works as an action thriller, as a science fiction movie, as a drama, and as a piece of cerebral filmmaking; I only wish its story was as comprehensive as its set pieces.8/10",Tenet

It's confusing, the characters are not interesting at all and really enjoy walking around looking important and dribbling exposition, and more than anything else in his filmography, it feels like he sat down to write it with the only thing in his head being ""Time, innit?""But I still like it. It's definitely something I'm going to have to watch again, because by god do the events and explanations for why things are happening fly by without even a passing thought for whether or not you're keeping up, but man was my mouth hanging open regardless.It has some of the best directed action scenes of last year without question, that more than makes up for the lack of any characters that are interesting, the soundtrack is pretty good as well, and man is the central ""tenet"", you could say, of time inversion is so much more interesting than just more straightforward time travel.And since that's really all it was trying to do, I guess I can't really ask for anything else. I feel like it could have been better directed in the non-action scenes, and certainly better acted in a few scenes, but the real reason it's only getting a 3.5 from me for now is that unlike other time travel films, I couldn't even tell you whether or not it made complete sense or broke its own rules at any point. Hell, I couldn't even tell you why the characters were doing what they were doing in a good amount of this film, so this is in some ways another one of my famous placeholder ratings until I see this again.But I like it.",Tenet

Unfortunately ""Tenet"" is pretty much that.For the first 2 hours I was loving the movie, and it was really the kind of one of experience you hope for. But the last half hour ruins the whole thing. Rendering it rediculus. I wish they'd just stuck to an original plan here and not twisted and turned too much towards the end.The last 30 minutes are like a different movie.

It's like using shaky camera in action scenes. We get an idea how intense the fight is but we won't get to see who's hitting who.

The narrative is complex alright but once you unravel, unwind and rewind your own mind you'll find the whole story too easy and its world, although multi-dimensional but still as flat as your ex's chest. The visual component though is absolutely perfect and you catch yourself staring at the screen in amaze many times. I don't know why didn't Chris work with Hans Zimmer on this one but it is visible (or to be precise hearable) from the get-go: music at times is just too darn loud and unfitting which disappointed a lot. As for acting the only weak link in Tenet is Kenneth Branagh whose theatrics, over the top dramaticality and godawful attempt at russian accent made me forget almost completely what a great actor he really was; maybe he just didn't get the material he had to work with. Overall the movie feels fresh visually and despite the runtime of 150 minutes holds your attention firmly but when it comes to the whole point of the matter and what this little world is all about it doesn't feel right to be invested in rewatching the movie again because apart from a few scenes there's just not much you'll leave in your memory as soon as you walk out of the movie theater.",Tenet

The Protagonist (a former CIA Agent) must master the art of ""Time Inversion"" to counter Andrei Sator.I guess we are going to find out what Time Inversion is. Let's hope it's an easy lesson. Well, here's the thing. Someone from the future has sent back armaments that can defy known laws of physics and Sator will use them to insure he can control everything on earth once he assembles the correct algorithm. The Protagonist realizes this and that Sator must be stopped. That is basically all you need to know. Think of him being a Bond, James Bond who must stop bad guy, Sator.Time inversion: Here's what you will see: Cars going in one direction and at the same time going in the opposite direction; Troops doing the same. This is Time Inversion. See? Suppose a bullet can change history by going in the opposite direction and what if a nuclear weapon can do the same? The Protagonist realizes this can be done and he knows Sator means to destroy the human race and must be stopped.Yes, much of the movie is confusing. Some scenes didn't need to be shown (or shown too long) that added to the confusion or maybe they supported what went before. Who knows? Like I said: confusing.I found the dialogues to be the most confusing and felt like many were dubbed and I couldn't fully understand what was being said. Clearer dialogues would have helped a lot. Didn't happen.Notables: Kenneth Branagh as Sator, the bad guy who wants to control everything on earth including its history; I enjoyed his almost overly calm approach to everything; Elizabeth Debicki as Kat, Sator's abused wife who is bound to him for fear of losing her son; Robert Pattinson as Neil, the Protagonist's Handler, who tries to explain physics over and over again; Michael Caine as Crosby who makes an appearance to give advice to the Protagonist. Dimple Kapadia as Priya, Tenet's advisor.This is too long a movie. Better, clearer dialogues were needed. The action scenes are amazing and CGI was used perfectly. Have no idea why the Protagonist is called the Protagonist. The title has less to do with the organization Tenet and more to do with Time Inversion (and how to stop it).

249,ivanmessimilos,Modern masterpiece,10,5 September 2020,"We finally got it, Christopher Nolan's new film has hit theaters. The spy action thriller aptly named Tenet really has a lot to offer in its two and a half hours duration. He would say even a little too much for one average viewer. I believe that many will take it as flaw.
Tenet is certainly the most complicated film in Nolan's oeuvre, and that says a lot considering his films like Memento, Inception or Interstellar. The non-linear course of the action and playing with the fourth dimension of our universe - time, is present in all his films. Not only is Tenet no exception, but Nolan has gone even a step further. Many scenes in the film can be freely declared one of the most impressive scenes in film history precisely because of this manipulation of time and the way of shooting.
Let's start with the script first. Nolan wrote it for five years, worked on it, consulted how this concept would make any sense anyway. Lead actors John David Washington and Robert Pattison had to read it in Nolan's locked Warner Bros. office so nothing would leak out. Washington (otherwise the son of the more famous actor Denzel) read the script for a long time because he often had to go back to catch everything. The same thing was with Kenneth Branath who read the script several times. Michael Caine, who stars in almost every Nolan film, only got pages from the script that pertain to his character so he didn't even know what exactly the film was about.
This may not seem like much to you, but it matters to me because it talks about the effort put into the film to give viewers the best possible cinema experience. Contributing to this is the fact that the entire film was shot without a single scene containing green screen. The film contains 280 shots with visual effects (CGI added in post-production), which is below the average of a romantic comedy today. For comparison his Dark Knight has 650, Inception 500, Dunkirk 429 shots. So a lot of practical effects, shooting scenes several times and great engagement of actors in their roles. It all sounds amazing when you look at the final product and the scenes that look impressive and almost impossible to capture.
We see the great influence of the films about the most famous secret agent James Bond as we follow the main protagonist who tries to connect the dots (and the viewers also with him) and save the world.
Many will blame Nolan for the lack of emotion or character development, in addition to the complexity of the film, but I would not personally agree with that because there is less, but quite enough emotion considering the genre of the film.
The film certainly requires viewing on the big screen for the full experience, but it also requires re-viewing so that all the details that could have escaped at first viewing can be captured and appreciated. That's why the film gets a higher rating for me because it gives you the opportunity to watch the film from a different perspective a second time.
I intentionally didn't want to write anything about the plot for two reasons: the first is that it's so complicated I could write one longer text just to explain what it's all about, and the second reason is that I just don't want to reveal any spoilers for those who haven't watched to be able to fully enjoy the film.
Some of the criticisms directed at the director and this film can be understood, but I can by no means agree with them.
Tenet is a masterpiece of contemporary film art that puts us at the heart of the action from the first scene and doesn't let go until the credits at the end of the film. Enjoyment for ten!",Tenet
250,danew13,WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT? : From the first scene convoluted vaguness abounds,5,30 November 2020,"Tenet was terribly written with scenes that don't meld together and action that is unexplained.

251,jackgdemoss,Taking mind-bending to a whole new level,8,1 September 2020,"We are no stranger to movies that reveal a jaw-dropping twist that changes the lens in which the entire movie must be viewed. People will often tell you that these kinds of movies are ""even better the second time around"". Well I am here to tell you that watching Tenet once is like watching half a movie. You simply must watch it a second time to understand it. Even the most observant and quick-witted audience member is going to have trouble piecing together parts in the first half without the information fed to you in the second half. This film takes mind-bending to a new level in the sense that my brain was completely exhausted after viewing.This leads to my one major complaint about the film. The sound mixing. If any background noise or music was playing in the movie while the characters are talking, I found it very difficult to hear what they were saying. If I had to guess, I only picked up on 60% of dialogue and had to use keywords to try and keep up. A lot of my complaints of movies are minor, but this was a huge drawback that pulled a potentially top 10 movie for me down.Aside from the complexity of the story, I also appreciated the top-tier score, high octane action, and stellar acting. All credit goes to Ludwig for producing such a fast paced and exciting score. The quick repetition of notes with the booming bass had me completely amped up at times. It paired nicely with the action style chosen which included aggresive and fast fighting movements. I am not sure if credit goes to who choreographed or to John Washington for such impressively blood-thirsty and efficient attacks.Tenet is the first film I have ever seen that I would advise anyone who has not seen to allot enough time to watch it twice back to back.",Tenet

Time travel has been the subject of many films & TV shows but here Nolan puts a twist on it, going backwards slowly or ""inversion"" ""reverse entropy"", interesting idea yet ultimately dull & boring, after watching Tenet it's clear why every aspect of this project had the highest of security & secrecy, had the details of this movie been leaked to the public they would have stayed clear of this mess of a movie, music score too loud just to hide the awful dialogue, sound effects of weapons & explosions loud & erratic so as to distract & confuse the viewer from realising how awful & messy the plot actually is.",Tenet
253,carlos37andre,Fascinating,9,5 December 2020,"I remember people talking about Inception, before I even saw it, that it was sooo mind blowing, complicated, complex, I always got to appreciate the mind-blowing part of it all, but I always had a feeling it wasn't really that complex after all, and well... I think Tenet definitely proves that point, good Lord this movie is complex and complicated lol.I truly had to watch this twice, before writing or even grading this thing, don't get me wrong, after the first time, you can truly appreciate the action pieces, the acting, the directing, the score, the cinematography, and almost everything else, but I couldn't piece the story I just watched together in my mind, I just couldn't.But well, I can confirm that, the second watch actually adds a whole other layer to the experience, it's almost like you are watching a whole new movie, and at the end of the day, you truly have two distinct experiences, that are, in their own way, good.I love the mystery that you have throughout almost the entire movie, when you don't actually know what the hell is happening, you are thrown into this story from the jump, and they truly won't explain much of it all until mid-way through the movie, and somehow, I was still entertained by it.I loved most of the action here, the air plane scene is insane, and the fact they truly crashed a plain is unbelievable. The whole concept of Tenet, and how these people are in a way, forever connected in a looping of sorts, is fascinating. Some parts of it my head actually hurts, when I try to understand (like trying to piece together if the moves on the fight scenes with someone inverted, and the other not-inverted makes sense, or the car chases). But man, this movie is fascinating, and insanely well executed.Nolan is definitely following a trend with his recent films tho, and I can't say I hate it. With Dunkirk he fully went to a non-conventional storytelling, with multiple storylines, with only two acts, without really a protagonist, I loved the sense of passing the ""in a war, you don't really know stuff about the person besides you, and people die, all the time"" feeling of it, and I thought it worked to perfection.Here in Tenet, he does a similar thing, with having ""the protagonist"" without almost any background, and... well, he doesn't even have a name, is definitely a bold move, and I get the point that, in a way, it makes it hard for us to care about him, or even understand his motivation at times, but well, I don't think it really matters that much at the of the day, and it doesn't make me like the movie that much less. Sure, he could have at least given us something abut the character, but since almost everything around him works (his relationship with Neil, Kat's storyline with her kid, Sator's motivation, and even the concept of the future wanting to destroy us, in order to... use our resources?, they all work, you don't really have time to think about the protagonist that much - in fact, at first I didn't even really he didn't have a name).This is by far tho, the most niched of Nolan's films, when I saw Dunkirk I thought the same, but now... Dunkirk seems like a regular family friendly movie, this one has so many layers, and sure, it has those characteristic ""Nolan scenes"" where he explains a lot of what is going on to us, the audience, however, is the definitely one of his movies that has less of it.Anyways, I love the mystery, I love the acting, I love the different concepts, and that I can't even get my head around some of them, and the repercussions that it might have on the characters, and the surroundings. Like, for example, when someone goes to the past, and then reverts back, the only way ""back to the future"" is by... living in the past for all the specific time? Do they age the same tho? That's all fascinating and weird to wrap your head around, and I love it.John David Washington is so good here, and continues to show he's one of the biggest revelations over the past few years in Hollywood, with BlacKKKlansman, and now this. Robert Pattinson, man... I was wrong, sorry for doubting your acting skills, I can't wait to see what you do with Batman, that's it, I said it. Elizabeth Debicki is also great here. And Kenneth Branagh... well, he definitely went places here, and I loved it. Anyways, the cast is great, I love that we got a bit of my man Aaron Taylor-Johnson too, he's always a blast to watch, the acting is great all throughout, and I loved it.At the end of the day, one has to be insane to not appreciate, at least the technical aspect of it all, I saw a stat on the trivia session here, that the movie has as many CGI scenes as a regular rom-com... I mean, that's insane, this is an action-packed movie, with time travel, all the technical stuff, a war and the fact he can make all this stuff that's happening, feel so real, with as much practical effect as possible is just remarkable. Nolan is just one of the best directors working today, innovative, experimental, refreshing, bold.",Tenet

Often with Nolan's films, you are left bemused until the final moments, where the overarching plot pieces fall into place, just as you were beginning to lose hope. Tenet does not have this - instead, the film is built around one time-travel gimmick that does little more than stage some cool reversed fight sequences, and wholly lacks the substantial plot to warrant a film.I love Christopher Nolan's films (Interstellar and The Dark Knight are two of my favourites), and even those films I didn't like I appreciate for what they are: in kind, I was enthralled by the first 15 minutes of explosions, fights and Nolan-esque drama (try making a torture scene PG-12 like he does, borderline impossible). Past there, Tenet seems more like an idea that spiralled out of hand, playing directly to the director's modus operandi without any studio executives saying, ""Isn't this plot a little rubbish?"". Decent acting (bar Kenneth Branagh as a Russian oligarch - seriously, just cast someone Russian and not awful?) and strong CGI does not mitigate the cardinal sin of films - a bad underlying plot.Lets look at some of the basic flaws. For one, the film gives you zero time to breathe. I would rather a film that is 30 minutes longer and develops the characters properly, instead of this jumble of fights/threats/cutscenes. Further to this, the timeframes in Tenet were so bizarre; no timescale was hinted to in some scenes, making everything even more convoluted when following an already non-linear story. Compounding this issue are the absolutely pointless characters (if you really consider it, the Indian Mafia could have been cut with no loss to the story), along with the mother of all cop-outs, a McGuffin ""algorithm"" object that has no relevance other than to help viewers grasp the potential of nuclear holocaust. There were other bad flaws, but if I keep writing them I might have an aneurism.I wanted to like Tenet - I wanted to love it - but below the surface it just didn't have anything that sets it apart from your run-of-the-mill jumbled story. Even those people I've spoken to who loved it couldn't really tell me why, nor could they fully explain the plot. I think this, however, is something up for debate: should a film be entirely understandable from the first watch? I will happily admit that Inception (another Nolan piece) has improved for me upon further viewings, but there was still enough from the initial watch that I could delineate what the story was. Tenet fails on this count, and I think Nolan should chalk this up as a failure. - HLO",Tenet
258,tfminfl,"Great flick! Rewatchability, way up there!!",10,13 September 2020,"458. Tenet. Well I loved it! I've seen it twice now, and admittedly the first time around my brainium in my cranium kept thinking about the whole technology of it all. I still thought it was a great action flick, but the time manipulation left me scratching the head for a minute or two. Second watch, however, I noticed one simple line as a 'scientist' character explains the tech to our main character: Don't think about, just react to it. Like most Nolan flicks you're thrown into the thick of things right away, the opera house scene from the trailer, and it never really lets up. Story is this, Spoilers, the protagonist is involved in some form of rescue or kidnapping depending on how you look at it, during which he sees something rather odd, a bullet hole in front of his face, seems to eject the bullet, travel right over his shoulder, through the man that was about to kill him, into the gun of another masked team member who quickly darts away, almost travelling back it time, but in regular time. But this doesn't matter because the mission goes south his cover is blown and he's tortured and commits suicide by swallowing a pill... And then he wakes up to find that being dead doesn't release you from your spy job, and because of the tech he witnessed he gets to hunt down the billionaire madman that created it, and like all billionaire mad men he wants to use the technology to destroy the world, possibly time and space along with it! John David Washington was cool, calm and collected as the Protagonist. Kenneth Branagh was a pretty convincing psychopath, his final scene is definitely brutal, deserved and deserves a golf clap.

259,Bertaut,"An aesthetic showcase that's completely uninterested in human beings (and for the love of God, what does Christopher Nolan have against decent sound mixing?)",2,27 December 2020,"Spending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Christopher Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time, a theme that's front and centre in Memento (2000), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.The plot of Tenet is straightforward in outline. We follow a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) as he is recruited into an ultra-secret international espionage squad called Tenet. His mission is simple - at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations.Tenet is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this, the budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, ""they must have spent a lot on catering."" With Tenet, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 VFX shots) - whether it be bungee-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse.It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, ""how the hell did they do that?""; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Along the same lines, the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is stunning, as he mixes 15-perf 70mm IMAX film with traditional 70mm stock and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable. It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema - no other art form could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and Tenet finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the art form can accomplish.Unfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems - most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a cliché, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times.As for the characters, good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cypher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. And there's nothing more to him - he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through-line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. As for Kenneth Branagh as Russian oligarch Andrei Sator, think of the most clichéd Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person - he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role, it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was ""that accent is hilarious."" Robert Pattinson's Neil (The Protagonist's handler) and Elizabeth Debicki's Kat (Sator's wife) fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people.Speaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is obliged to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in Tenet, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.At one point early in the film, The Protagonist is told ""don't try to understand it, just feel it"", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. Tenet is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike Memento (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, Tenet offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is than trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void - all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core.",Tenet

In terms of the story itself, it's the typical ""scratch your head"" Nolan style, during the first act, with very complex dialogues, full of dense information, but as soon as a viewer gets carried away, it's a crazy ride that leads us to connect small details that we saw earlier, that make a perfect loop of stifling action and drama.

263,drunken_munki,This is definitely Nolan's worst film,3,29 November 2020,"Before I pick on the plot and storytelling issues, let us discuss the general presentation. The movie is shot alright, but feels rather lackluster compared to the Batman trilogy, or Inception or Interstellar. The action is average, but there is a serious disconnect here since most of the time you have no idea who is who and what their goals are. So the action becomes boring and noisey.Anyway, the music seems more generic this time around as well. Not sure what is more disappointing, since usually Nolan is careful with his music team and at least you end up with something unique and great. Here you get generic electronic stuff mixed with dubstep and/or rap music.Now the storytelling is confusing. Stunted dialogue, forced technobabble and characters saying things like 'don't try to understand it'... Yeah I got it, Nolan doesn't understand it either, so he didn't bother writing a script that made any sense.Before you go to pay to watch this crap, just understand if you like nonsensical time travel related plots with no time spent understanding the characters or driving any development. If you think that is for you, then great.One of the main issues this movie doesn't work is that Nolan doesn't want to explain a single thing about the plot. Just vague hints dropped here and there. The story fails to pull me in because the nemesis of the story is never met or the doomsday never occurs. It is just an idea, with no payoff anywhere. Just a vague and limp twist at the end.3/10 it is not the worst big budget film of 2020, but it is close and very disappointing.",Tenet
264,Lewis_Heather787,Definitely need a second viewing !,8,31 August 2020,"After months and months of being pushed back and rescheduled due to coronavirus, at last Tenet has been released and wow what a film to experience. That is exactly my first overriding feeling after watching Tenet for the first time, it was such a rollercoaster of an experience. This film is full on from start finish and barely slows down even tho its has a sizeable runtime of 2hr 30mins, it definitely didn't feel like that to me.Tenet on first viewing is extremely confusing! This has got to be the most Nolan esq film ever made as if someone else had made it trying to be like Nolan. There is so much that goes on in this film that it is impossible to remember and connect all the dots on just one viewing. So after seeing it a second time and reading some online ending explainers ( I've never had to do that for a film ever until now ) I am pretty convinced that this is going to be a very divisive film. If you are a Nolan fan and like is methods of story telling and film making you are more likely to be on board. If you like strange films with lots of ambiguity then you'll probably find Tenet good too, however if your just a causal film fan I'm not so sure this gonna be for you. I completely understand why.The second viewing for me helped so so much in understanding and answering all the questions I had from watching it the first time. However some part of me thinks that Nolan has made this film overly complex on purpose so you have to see it a second time. Now that is a clever move. So anyone reading this and didn't like it the first time watching it I'd say give it another go because you might start to see everything fall into place.Personally for me I really really enjoyed my experience watching it, my eyes were glued to the screen and my jaw ajar sometimes and the brilliance of the direction. From an action, scope and scale point of view this film has it all and then some, to me it makes all the James Bond and John Wick films look like child's play. Nolan's persistence on using as little CGI as possible definitely makes the experience feel more real and realistic however when CG is used it is done beautifully......the inversion and the final battle fantastic.John David Washington is quickly becoming a major star, this as well as Blackkklansman definitely showing his range as an actor........brilliant in the lead even without a character name. Robert Pattison is on a role at the moment, once again really good in the supporting role behind Washington. Elizabeth Debicki is the heart and soul of the film and delivers a good performance in her limited role. Kenneth Branagh is 100% the correct casting for that villain, blew me away with such a menacing performance. Lastly of course Michael Caine is in this film, even tho its only for a couple of minutes, brilliant as always.Overall I'm gonna give this a soft 8 out of 10 or 80% out of 100 its definitely not one of Nolan's best films but I think thats because its his most inaccessible, you really have to focus when watching this. Outstanding directing as always, fascinating and overly complex story. Two dimensional characters yes I understand the complaint although the backstory is filled in as the film goes along. Action, tension, spectacle, wonder and mystery this really is the definition of a spy thriller on a huge scale. My advice watch it twice because it is definitely worth it !!!!!",Tenet
265,pensacolacomputer,Bomb,2,1 December 2020,"This movie bombed at the box office with good reasons....Maybe next time try not to make such a ""woke"" movie, and then maybe you will actually make a profit instead of a HUGE loss",Tenet
266,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Is confusing...needs a rewatch.,7,1 September 2020,"I'm kind of at a loss here. I did like the film. It was well wade made, had a good premise, great acting, great action....but I also have to admit how utterly confused I was. Like, I had no problem with Nolan's other sci-fi works like Inception and Interstellar but this one was tough to follow. It wasnt even so much the science aspect, it was just keeping track of characters and the missions. I felt like those other films in question did a better job of establishing characters. And not just establishing characters, but a better sense of team. We follow John David Washington the whole time, but so many other characters just drop in and out randomly (or are just glorified 5 min cameos) that it was just hard to keep track. I did ask myself about 1 1/2 hour in the film ""How did John's character meet Robert's character? I forget"". Or the very end mission, they are basically split into 2 groups and i understood what Elizabeth Debicki's character was doing, but the other team I had to ask myself ""And what are they doing in all of this, again?"". I dunno, I just think the film could have done a better job explaining. And I do want to see the film again (though probably not again until its out on bluray/digital), but I think it also makes it hard to rate the film now. On one hand, I feel like rating the film a 6 is offensive. I dont think its a bad film, far from it. And theres a lot to like. But at the same time, I feel like rating it a 7 might be too high considering its not too concise. Even though I will re-watch, I dont think you should have to watch a film more than once to understand it. A film should tell you what you need to know the first time.",Tenet
267,GraXXoR,Just the perfect amount of WTF...,9,18 June 2021,"Anyone who needs two watches to understand this movie needs to learn how to concentrate better. Really. Or learn a to watch films sober.Anyone who complains that a film shouldn't need multiple watches to understand
has really lost the plot and should just go back to Tik Tok or Youtube Shorts.After reading all the comments, I was expecting something even more complex than Primer, Inception, well at least more complex than Interstellar, but that was not the case here.There are hints and moments in the film aplenty that nudge you in the direction of what's coming which is much more effective than just pulling a bunch of Deus Ex Machinas from your pocket like some films do.Here, nothing was left to chance, the red and blue timelines interlocked exquisitely and the ""science"" was kept semi plausible.Also, there are two scenes, one longer than the other, where this film shows its true genius.... Bravo! You'll know them when you watch them.All in all a top notch watch.Will watch it again, not because I didn't understand it, but because I just want to appreciate the sheer attention to detail that went into this.-1 star because it didn't milk the science mystery aspect long enough...",Tenet

269,Christopher_Reid,"Intense, thought-provoking, time-bending thriller",10,23 August 2020,"I never understand Nolan's movies the first time. They're both more complex and simpler than I initially anticipate. As in, there are too many details to fully take in with one viewing but, at the same time, many events and themes overlap with each-other. The answers were already there but I know I'll have to see it a few times to really get it. In the meantime, this movie is stuck in my head like nothing I've ever seen before.Many of the classic Nolan tropes are here - weird time stuff, people in fancy suits explaining rules and one-upping each-other alternately with threats and quips, epic action scenes with shooting, explosions, cars and planes, jittery pounding music, people looking at watches, seeing events from multiple angles, saving the world coming down to personal relationships, etc. There are also interesting themes of lifting yourself up by the bootstraps and transcending or breaking the rules to kind of have your cake and eat it too. Characters do the impossible and we're not sure if they were on top of things the whole time or barely fluked it.Nolan's movies are sometimes criticised for being too pretentious or laborious with exposition, but they're just very intricate and intelligent. Do people want him to explain everything thoroughly or let you work it out for yourself? It's a fine line between accessibility and mystery, not to mention how bold and original he's trying to be. When brand new concepts are being explored, I think a little confusion on the first watch is perfectly reasonable. It's not like Einstein's theory of relativity was immediately accepted as obvious.The music is suitably intense but it was very loud. I think the balance may have been off at my cinema - I couldn't always understand the dialogue which was already tricky to follow. The plot was very tricky to follow although it keeps you involved and excited about where everything's leading. In particular, it's very vague in terms of who the bad guys are or what's actually at stake and why. But the plot thickens and starts to come together quite literally.There were some touches which I enjoyed like the red logos at the start and a blue one at the end and a scene with trains going in opposite directions from each-other forming a nice visual metaphor (those will make more sense once you see the movie).The actors were all really good. Branagh plays a convincing and very nasty Russian or Ukrainian criminal, Pattinson's an intelligent buddy with mysterious intentions while Washington's a likeable and funny protagonist for us to relate to, seemingly as confused as us for most of the film.The main thing that stands out for me is the concept of this movie itself which has never been done before. It's simple and implied in the posters and trailers but I couldn't predict how Nolan would actually make it work. Even if the broader story still has loose ends for me, I can't stop thinking about it. They apparently consulted Kip Thorne or other scientists (I saw his name in the credits) and the physics seem to hold up pretty well under the circumstances. The implications are fascinating and hard to get your head around.Some of the action scenes echo Inception's hallway fight scenes but with a different twist to them. Instead of playing with gravity, Nolan's playing with time. Again, it makes you marvel at what you're watching and how on Earth they filmed it. A lot of clever planning, choreographing, editing and multiple takes I guess. After Tenet, other movies seem so plain and light, what with their exclusively forward motion of time and entropy. Few movies can match the sheer intensity and intricacy of Tenet which I can't wait to watch again. None of Nolan's movies have disappointed me on multiple viewings.",Tenet
270,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,Tried it but I didn't stay till the end,7,26 December 2020,I dont really know what to rate this movie. I did watch over half in cinema but I couldn't follow the story so I finally walked out. From what I saw it looked really good with great action scenes and camera work very well put together. It was a complicated plot and it wasn't for me but I couldn't call this bad or crap just cause I didn't get it. I would say to everyone do give this at least 1 try. I've seen people say it took them 2 goes so I might try again at some point my self.,Tenet
271,baywoodarborist,First of its kind,6,13 January 2021,I understand this movie was kind of a first. The idea and plot was special. I would think everyone would have to watch it at least twice to begin to grasp it. I looked up the explanation of the movie on YouTube after I watched the movie once. The big problem with this film is that there's no attempt to make the viewer care about the characters. That's where the movie really fails. With no connection to the chapters in the story I have no reason to watch it again.,Tenet
272,elgrampo77,Waste of time and money,1,2 January 2021,"Just pure crap and I did love inception. But that one had a great and understandable story while Tenet is just pure nonsense that leaves everyone confused, probably even the actors themselves. Oh, and most of the action is basically just recorded action played backwards. And the cherry on the cake is the horrible film music that makes understanding of anyways hardly understandable Dialoges even harder. They wanted to make sometime Inception 2.0 but just overdid it massively.",Tenet
273,nidhunmoviebuff,"Not his best, but a thrill ride nevertheless from the Nolan-verse",7,5 December 2020,"#MovieReview #Tenet #ChristopherNolan #SpoilerFreeThe most awaited film of the year did not disappoint. Tenet is the latest potboiler from master auteur Christopher Nolan and true to form is as mind-bending as it comes.The core concept of time-inversion caused many a headache but the thrills and spills guarantee an engaging watch.Spellbinding chase sequences, air-crashes and close-quarters combat, all choreographed to perfection makes for a terrific viewing experience.John David Washington is adequate as 'The Protagonist' while Robert Pattinson delivers another memorable performance as the mysterious 'Neil'.

274,AdrenalinDragon,Nolan's Reverse/Inverse trend of hits and misses continue,6,26 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan has been very hit or miss with me lately, and Tenet was very close to being on the negative side. I appreciated some of the action sequences and stunt work that was done in the film. However, the story didn't really grab me as much as I had initially hoped and I didn't feel I got an emotional connection
with any of the characters. Honestly, I was scratching my head on how the reverse/inverse gimmick sort of worked and wasn't 100% sure it all made
sense or Nolan was full of himself. Maybe I'm an idiot I have no idea, but man I was confused with all the sudden location and time changes and what the hell
most of the characters were supposed to be doing. Inception was very straightforward and cleanly structured compared to this.The acting for the most part is pretty solid, but no one really blew me away or made me go I'll remember that character's name or anything. I also
felt it was kind of sloppily edited? Like some shots didn't clearly show what was going on and it felt a bit rushed I guess? Don't get me wrong the film
still has some solid cinematography and set-pieces, but it's not all very consistent in this film. There were twists and turns that could easily be guessed as well, but I don't feel the payoff is really justified. It really feels like a messy Inception/James Bond hybrid with Time Travel the more I sit to think about it.I also noticed the sound mixing was quite bad in places. There were a few scenes where you couldn't hear what the characters were saying because the music was so loud. I initially thought it was just my cinema screening, but nope other people have reported it as well on the Internet, and it's a big problem because some of that dialogue is explaining crucial information about the story and the reverse/inverse gimmick. I shouldn't have to require putting subtitles on for an English speaking film just to hear what they are bloody saying normally! I also felt like I was missing Hans Zimmer's score and the replacement guy doing this one didn't give us anything nearly as memorable in terms of music.So yeah, Tenet is a major letdown considering it was one of the most hyped films of 2020. Maybe I'm just getting sick of Christopher Nolan at this point trying to tell
gimmicky story-lines that may or may not make sense at all. It's certainly not the worst thing ever, but I was really hoping this would be his major comeback and sadly I think the decline is there and see this as one of his weakest movies.5.5/10",Tenet
275,peeedeee-94281,"A PG, Mediocre Film",3,1 September 2020,"I'm not sure why Christopher Nolan would want kids to see this film, it's not easy to follow even for adults. A movie that requires multiple viewings to be appreciated is not a well-made flick.
I've been following Nolan's films for years, but sadly, his last few films have been more misses than hits. He may want to start collaborating with others, especially when it comes to dialogue and fleshing out the characters, and maybe getting a coherent story.
The concept of reverse time may sound interesting, and look cool in a 2 minute trailer, but in this movie, it's almost like an afterthought, in much of the middle of the film. And when it is used, it's very confusing, the explanations for how it came to be, and the rules of this world, don't make much sense. It's like Inception, you just have to accept that people are able to do what they do, without questioning the logic or science behind it.
This is basically a fantasy film, with a few flaws. For example, there was one scene that was a real head scratcher, when a bunch of trucks surrounded a police convoy. They were literally surrounding this convoy for several miles, and none of the police felt like they were in danger or radioing for back ups?! And by the time they figured something was wrong, it was too late. Too convenient.
Also, I didn't understand why they needed to take an injured friend to a place they were at earlier, only to reveal what was pretty much a predictable twist. And why didn't the people around them notice the strange people walking backwards? lol
None of the characters are all that interesting or engaging. Honestly, I wasn't even rooting for anyone or any outcome, because I really didn't feel connected to the story. Too much work trying to follow what was happening took me out of the film, I didn't feel the world Nolan set up, was drawing me in.
The ending felt very anticlimactic, we basically just have to accept that what just transpired was for the good of mankind.
All very strange, not realistic, not even engaging. Technically, the film looked great. Especially in IMAX. But as many have pointed out, the sound mix is atrocious. Reminds me of Interstellar, with that low rumble hum, passing as incidental music, drowning out the dialogue.",Tenet
276,kenzibit,Another Masterpiece 👌🏾,9,5 December 2020,Another great one from Christopher Nolan. Been excited from the day this movie got announced and finally got to watch and I must say this movie is an extraordinary masterpiece. Story basically centers around time and time inversions all crafted around theoretical Physics thus making it a unique experience. No spoilers here but the whole idea of forward and backwards fighting scenes and interactions make the jaw drop and you will will have lots of rewinding moments. I highly recommend watching this movie more than once with subtitles on and you will appreciate it more when you get the whole concept and plot of the movie. I really enjoyed it and tops my favourite list of movies this year. 👍🏾,Tenet
277,carlos-pires,"No wonder the movie's official tagline is ""Time runs out"".",1,24 December 2020,"Please don't call this science fiction. At most, it's another piece of anti-science fiction. Why? Not only because the main premises fly in the face of all the most basic knowledge science has had about time and space, but specially because the plot hinges on utterly incoherent premises.There is a set of rules science knows govern this universe. Surely, if you want to write science fiction, then by all means come up with some different set of rules. That's what fiction is about. Be creative: create your own rules, or add to what is already known. But the moment you cherrypick contradictory ideas just to serve as a backdrop to action scenes, you fall in the realm of ""anything goes"". This is not science fiction. I't fantasy. It's magic.*I see now that this is one of those movies some people will claim they love, despite the fact they don't understand any of it. But I guess that's just what Nolan is aiming at here. He might have actually hit the motherlode: a formula for movies made for sheeple who think they should say they love, for fear of being singled out as ""the guy who didn't get it"".Furthermore, it is a boring movie. Two hours into it I was already nodding. The plot revolves around time. And Nolan actually manages to reverse it: he manages to subtract 150 minutes of your lives. No wonder the movie's official tagline is ""Time runs out"".---* You don't need a PhD in physics to know that ""entropy"" is measured on a closed system, nor do you need to be computer engineer to know that an ""algorithm"" is not metal object.",Tenet
278,TheOny13,Required multiple viewings!,10,28 November 2020,"The first time I saw this movie I was completely entertained, massively baffled by all the twists I saw but somewhat confused because I couldn't follow up the story closely enough. Needless to say I watched the movie a second time and all my confusion was blown away and replaced with amazement at how Nolan was able to create this movie and plan every single step of the movie from the very begining up until the final poingnant ending. Without a doubt this is one of the, if not the most mind-bending movie ever created, in my opinion at least. So instead of my usual plot breakdown, I'll be going through this movie chronologically, as well as I can. So buckle up 'cause this is going to be rough.So the movie kicks off with the opera prologue. And lets call this moment 0. There the protagonist finds one of the pieces of the algorithm. That is where we first see Neil with his red chord on his backpack. So from here everything goes chronologically culminating with protagonist death, rebirth and hiring in Tenet. He meets Neil for the first time in person and they find out that the person responsible for the inverted objects is Andrei Sator. So protagonist goes to a british contact who will help him reach Sator. So it is here that we get the first temporal clue. It's been two weeks since the opera attack in Kiev. So it is here that Sator disapears from Kat and emerges with inverted objects and starts building his plan to destroy the world with the algorithm. It is also on the same day that Kat sees a woman jumping from his yacht and starts suspecting Sator might cheat on her. It is also here that the algorithm is defused and protagonist and his team stop Sator. So moving forward from this moment (two weeks after Kiev siege) in time, protagonist gets close to Sator and all that stuff, till we get to the freeport scene where Neil and protagonist try to destroy a painting thus lifting Sator's leaverage on Kat. And here things get complicated. Neil and protagonist go into the turnstiles and from them comes out protagonist on his younger version's side inverted and fights with himself while on Neil's side he comes up normal. So at this moment in time, as we find out later, we have two Neils and two protagonists and also two Kats. One of whom is inverted to heal the inverted bullet wound that she gets in the future from Sator. Crazy until now? Hold on, it only gets crazier! So the normal protagonist that escapes Neil goes out of the freeport, signals inverted Neil with Kat to go through the turnstile and revert themselves back to normal and then meets up with normal Neil and Kat who is now almost healed. We will continue that a bit later. Now, the inverted protagonist, we are going to follow him backwards, while following the present day protagonist that fought with his inverted self, normally. So inverted protagonist fights himself gets cut and his wound gets worse in normal flow of time, but because he is inverted from his point travelling back his wound becomes worse until the moment it is created, which is the fight with himself. From here normal flowing protagonist goes even further beyond two weeks past moment 0. He meets with Pryia and finds out about the plutonium 241 which was seen in the prologue and which is now guarded by ukranian security services. So normal flow protagonist meets Sator, saves his life and then goes on the mission to get the plutonium for Sator. Here is where things get a little bit complicated. Inverted protagonist is now going backwards from the ship he was on going back to Oslo, and reaches his trapping inside the car which is blown by inverted Sator after the car chase. All while normal flow Sator beats his wife at the turnstyle and gets in where the normal flow protagonist is being held. So after the yacht, normal flow protagonist goes with Neil and his team to extract the algorithm piece on that truck scene and then they start seeing the grey car going backwards, that being the inverted protagonist. They also see inverted Sator to whom protagonist throws an empty case while throwing the piece into the grey car going backwards. The car chase ends with a shootout and then protagonist is captured by normal flow Sator's people and brought to the turnstile where normal flow Sator was wating for him, while also having the normal team of Sator pick the piece from the grey car based on inverted Sator's info from the past. Before normal flow Sator threatens to shoot him if he doesn't give the location of the plutonium, protagonist sees Kat getting shot by Sator with an inverted bullet. Remember this Kat is in normal flow, picked up by the inverted Sator after the normal one beat her up and carried through the car chase. So normal Kat gets inside the inverted chamber with inverted Sator and she gets the inverted bullet. So after normal Sator threatens protagonist, Neil's team arrive and Sator gets inverted and takes normal Kat bringing her back in the inverted car through the car chase back to where normal Sator left her off. So now we are at the point in time after Sator's inversion. We have normal Kat in an inverted room, that gets brought to the normal room by Neil's team. Then normal flow protagonist inverts with Neil and his team plus Kat in order to have her wound inverted. Here is where it gets really crazy. So from her normal flow of time the wound was made by an inverted object. So now she is bleeding and her wound is as an inverted object inside her. So if an inverted object like a wound gets worse as time goes by, inverting Kat results in inverting the inverted wound which will now go backwards in her resulting in her healing up. Make sense? So here is where everything ties up until this moment in the movie. Remember we are still two weeks after the opera siege and the algorithm defusion. Now we are going to pick up where we last left off, where normal flow protagonist escapes with Neil and Kat whose wound is now a scar. But this happens two days before protagonist's talk with Pryia about the 241. So now we are two days before the car chase. So protagonist talks to Pryia and plans his temporal pincer by meeting with Ives team and inverting to go back two weeks at the same time with the opera heist which was the moment 0. So now we reach the climax of the movie. And here is where it becomes tricky. Protagonist's team split up into 2 parts. One normal flow and one inverted. The one in normal flow has its briefing at point 0, while inverted team has the briefing 1 hour after point 0. So after point 0 going forward in time team red normal flow does the mission while blue inverted team undoes the mission. Here is where Neil improvises while still inverted, when he sees one of Sator's team members planting a bomb. So he inverts and picks protagonist and Ives after they get saved by Neil inverted who dies in order for them to make it out. So in the end when all three escape and split the algorithm we find out that Neil had the backpack with the red chord attached to, and that he had trained with protagonist his entire life and that from this point protagonist begins his side of friendship with Neil. The movie ends with protagonist tying up the last loose end that was Pryia while suggesting also that he might be going further back in time to meet with Neil and start his side of the friendship, until the point where Neil comes to the protagonist.What a complex and fantastic film. From the incredible soundtrack to the excellent acting from most of the cast and to directing and cinematography, this movie is a blast from start to finish, full of twists and turns but also saving the best for the last in Neil's reveal. You know, I think sometimes that people's ability to comprehend movies has significantly decreased in the last decade or so. Many people compared this film with Inception, and while I see how one would do that, I can also say that if that film was to be released around this time it would get the same response as Tenet did. People have gotten used to movies spoon feeding them everything and not trying to do challenging things or to make the audience question themselves, yet alone put pieces together and understand a complex film. And we have to thank the MCU for that. I believe a film like this would have been way better received 10 years ago when people still wanted engaging movies with complex, multi-layered plots. A criticism I often heard about this movie is that it has no emotional core. That might be the most simplistic thing I've ever heard about this movie. This movie's emotional core is the relationship between Neil and protagonist which expands even further than the movie itself and lands an emotional blow right at the end when we find that Neil is going to his death. I felt that the first time I saw this movie in theater and by the second time I saw the movie, tears were filling my eyes. Also what is everyone's problem with the sound design? I watched this in cinema the first time and had no problem understading everything, and second time on PC also understanding everything. As for other criticism, for example about the lack of the main character's name, that is basically done purposefully because he is a new man ever since he dies at the begining of the movie, and because it would be wise that he didn't have a name so that he could see his temporal pincer through to the end. Honestly the only criticism I might have towards the movie is that the first act feels a little choppy with busywork that in a way never has any impact on the plot. I would have liked for the movie maybe to set the rules more elaborately in the begining so it would't be so hard later to follow everything that happens. Ultimately Tenet is a modern masterpiece, a movie so complex and puzzling that it takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate. I certainly did after the second watch, so if you felt somewhat confused after the first viewing, go watch it again, it's a movie meant to be experienced! 10/10",Tenet

I was also the only person in the auditorium so I got the best seat.
For 10 minutes I struggled to understand any of the dialogue. The music was far too loud and bass heavy, speech was muddled. I complained to the staff who apologized and offered a refund saying the audio was poor but that was the way the film was released to them. I could switch to another screening but the audio would be the same.
Knowing the covid lockdown was due to kick in I decided to soldier on hoping for a small improvement (audio was ok during quieter scenes). This was a mistake. About an hour into the movie the 'direction' changes and I immediately started to feel physically unsettled. A few movies have this affect on me (Captain Phillips, Rush) a form of VIMS for those of you who susceptible to it.
I struggled on to the bitter end but my ability to focus on the plot was severely compromised.
I suspect I would really enjoy the movie if I was able to understand more than 60% of the dialogue and didn't have to fight a strong urge to vomit.",Tenet
286,foxtografo,Not sure what rating,6,14 December 2020,"I do like the idea, it's super complex to visualize and I totally see the fun and potential of a second view, when you'll understand many things going on that you couldn't on the first view.
I haven't done that second watch yet and to be honest, I don't know if I will.
Even if the mechanics of the idea are complex and might be confusing, I did get all that on the first watch, but many things were a bit messy, silly and inconsistent, straight forward things that shouldn't be confusing!
The characters jumping from place to place and the over-complex attack plans they come up with (just for the sake of making the scene look original) end up being a bit ridiculous in their execution.
But what brings me down is the lack of presence of the main character, his weird posture didn't project any ""badassness"" as the character is supposed to do, his acting was quite stiff, and there was no chemistry (imo) with the female character, which I also thought was quite bland, unidimensional and clichéd, I felt no connection between them or with any of them.
Pattinson's performance was way better, and the action were forward and reverse, are very clever and cool. Still should need to watch again to see if some of that action makes sense, not too sure about it, but it wouldn't make the movie less enjoyable for me.
In the end, I do enjoy the thematic and the main idea, and how it works for the action, but I didn't like the characters and it feels messy and inconsistent at moments, besides the complexity of the premise.
I might change my mind on a second watch though, will see in time ;)",Tenet

I never enjoyed Inception and never really got into Matrix , if these are your type of films you'll probably love it .For me it was just a plotless confusing mess but Nolan fans ( not the Nolan sisters ) are raving about itThe three of us in the cinema were all scratching our heads after it finished which took an eternitySorry just not my cup of tea , cannot recommend it .Pad.A 1/10",Tenet

Really intelligent but hard to fully grasp everything that is happening. Stylish, fun, great cast, great action sequences. Really felt like I was watching James Bond but in a ScFy movie. My only real gripe was that at times it was a proper mumble fest. Could barely hear what was being said due to characters wearing masks, explosions and a great but crazy loud score. Really enjoyed it. Marked down for the mumbling which made a complicated plot even harder to understand. Feels like it could be a franchise in the making but said that about inception and that was never revisited. Hope this gets a sequel.",Tenet
289,Mivas_Greece,"Unique concept, high complexity in scenario and details, with top-class actors could have been classes superior to Inception. Still, unique and recommended to everyone.",8,9 December 2020,"Action / science fiction movie. A really pioneering idea in the sense of time as a dimension. With suitable devices one can not travel, but move backwards in time. He is reversed and others see him that way, but for him everything else is reversed. Huge and unique idea, highly complex script, and very rapid pace, requires the viewer to be concentrated all the time to fully understand everything. An action movie, which however in the first half was generally missing, and there were some characteristic directing mistakes. In the second half there were several reversed scenes and shot by both versions for the viewer to understand and solve some mysteries. The plot also had some nice twists. The actors were still too mediocre to make such a film, though not bad at all. The film, unprecedented and unique in its kind, could reach and become classes higher than Inception if it had top-class experienced actors to take it to a different level. A typical example could be the experienced in both action movies and emotion Will Smith and with a worthy co-star. Also, despite the complexity in the detail in the reversed scenes, huge mistakes were made in simple scenes, as if they were made in a hurry. I think that with top actors but also with more work in directing / dialogue or even a reduction of the first part which was quite boring in my opinion, it could be one of the top films of Nolan and the genre in general. However, the movie can not even touch the inception which has a relatively simpler idea to conceive, but in which excellent work had been done by both Nolan and DiCaprio. It is nevertheless a movie to watch again and again and one of the very good fantasy / action movies. Recommended to everyone.7.5 / 10 from me",Tenet
290,Slarkshark,I think I liked it,8,13 September 2020,"Actually, I am quite certain I liked it. Though, I am sure I will appreciate it a lot more once I've given it a few run throughs. Perhaps by the third watching, my mind will un-pretzel itself to what is actually happening and when. Also, I will be watching with subtitles! Trying to hear the dialogue, especially when it is trying to explain what is going on was next to impossible. The sound mixing with the dialogue made it that much harder to follow.That being said, Nolan pulled no punches. He was all in on this one, and if it could be described in one sentence... ""The most Nolany film ever"". If that makes sense? It has that feel that all his recent films in the last 15 years have had. The whole concept is very ambitious, which Hollywood needs more of. The cinematography was great, it gives you this grand scale of the world. The effects were also great, especially the middle action heist sequence. I loved seeing Robert Pattison in a huge role where he could actually show how talented he is. Some seem to still be stuck on the whole Twilight era and not realize he has been phenomenal in so many roles since then. Was excited to see John David Washington since Blackkklansman, and he did not disappoint.Missed Hans Zimmer though.",Tenet
291,Zedyeti,Painfully bad and not interesting unfortunately,2,3 May 2021,"Really not into researching and dissecting this movie to ""get it"". We already did that with inception. The idea of forcing multiple watches to fully get what Nolan was trying to do led me to turn off this garbage fire about 30 min in. It's just not interesting at all from the start. The score is weirdly loud at times and the actors mumble, what is that about? It's also presented in an artsy style that makes it more confusing to understand what is truly happening. Inception did work for Nolan but this just seems like inception's drunk cousin and was made with leftover plot lines. It's not good.",Tenet

294,hunter-friesen,"""Tenet"": An Incomprehensible Spectacle",7,2 September 2020,"Spell it backward or forward, it spells the same. From Christopher Nolan - the virtuoso behind ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy, ""Inception"", and ""Dunkirk"" - comes ""Tenet"", an action blockbuster on a scale not seen before and that will never be replicated again.Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real-time.The plot summary I just gave you is the exact one supplied by the studio. I did this for fear of spoilers and because I cannot confidently give out any more information than what has already been covered.""Tenet"" may be the most incomprehensible and mentally straining movie ever made. It feels like taking a whole semester of advanced physics in only one class period, all while being set in a warzone. I have no doubt there will be case studies and theses done about this movie.Nolan wastes no time throwing his audience over the deep end. He begins the film at a breakneck pace, moving from scene to scene in the blink of an eye. You struggle to grasp onto the high concept in real-time and are always playing catchup. This problem only exponentially gets worse as Nolan refuses to hold your hand as he goes further down the rabbit hole. Even one of the characters in the movie says ""Don't try to understand it, feel it"". It's almost as if Nolan inserted that quip just for the audience.The inability to follow the movie can be attributed to the out of the box concept, but mostly it falls on Nolan's embarrassingly weak script. The problems here are the same ones people have been saying about him for years now, that he overuses exposition and under-delivers on the emotional parts of his narrative.""Tenet"" is nearly all exposition and no emotion. Many times the exposition gives more questions than answers and seems to be intentionally leading us astray. It's also Nolan's coldest film as any emotion is forced through cliche storylines that seem included to check off a box rather than tell a story.On a technical level, ""Tenet"" is both Nolan's most and least impressive film to date.The action set-pieces mix both practical and visual effects seamlessly, creating awe-inspiring showcases of movie magic. The use of time inversion in fight sequences, car chases, and an entire battle are just some of the moments that you have to see to believe. Hoyte Van Hoytema encapsulates all the gorgeous chaos in stunning widescreen cinematography and composer Ludwig Göransson overtakes your ears with a perfect hard-charging score.What's a problem here, and has been for some time now, is Nolan's astoundingly poor sound mixing. Without hesitation, I can say that ""Tenet"" is the loudest movie I have ever seen. Every gunshot felt like it went off next to my ear and every explosion shook my entire body. The ungodly loud sound effects made it near impossible to comprehend much of the dialogue, which was already poorly mixed, to begin with. If you thought it was hard to understand Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"", just wait until you try to understand what the characters are saying here.Even with all my gripes, I was still enveloped in the world Nolan has created. There have been dozens of movies where I was lost after a few minutes and checked out for the remaining runtime. With ""Tenet"", I was lost after minute one and completely invested for the remaining one hundred forty-nine. Part of that interest comes from the spectacle and part of that comes from the likable cast.In a star-making lead performance oozing with charisma, John David Washington plays our protagonist, who is literally called The Protagonist. He's our vessel as he enters into this strange new world with no previous knowledge and must solve a deadly puzzle that goes against all logic.Robert Pattinson keeps his hot streak going with another charming performance as The Protagonist's sidekick, Neil.Kenneth Branagh is intermittently good as our Russian villain, Andrei Sator. He's exceptionally menacing in the quieter moments and cartoonishly over-the-top in his moments of outburst.Elizabeth Debicki plays the most emotionally resonant character as the helpless wife of our villain. Debicki is great in the role but is unfairly used more as an object for the story.""Tenet"" is a full-on assault of the senses that contains unparalleled moments of spectacle and ambition. It's nowhere near the top of Nolan's filmography and will surely require multiple viewings to unravel. Make sure to pack some ibuprofen and prepare to have your mind twisted in ways you never thought possible.",Tenet
295,MamadNobari97,What TF Is Happening?,6,29 November 2020,"Seriously, can you tell? What exactly is anyone doing anything? Who tf are they fighting in that last battle? Who are they shooting? Why are the bad guys doing what they're doing knowing what's gonna happen? Why are the dialogues so childish and amateurish?
WTF was the sailing scene? What the actual F was the point of that? Why is the editing so weird?
The ""protagonist"" doesn't know and in his 30 years of life never heard of the grandpa paradox so the other guy explains it to him to the audience can know what it is? Is that the best way you can come up with an exposition? Are you serious? ""The whole world will fkn end"", ""oh no, my son will die too"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!?!
Inception was good because the movie explained the rules of that world and we understood why things were happening and what the motivation of each character was, but this? Yeah, good luck finding anything that makes sense in this. Ask Nolan and even he doesn't know wtf he wrote and what the rules of this nonsensical world is.
The movie is just too fkn fast-paced for its own good. Movie is 2 and a half hours but it's like a theatrical version of a 3 or 3:30hour director cut.
With this rate Nolan's going, I'm thinking his next movie will be just 2 hours of earr*pe soundtrack and we can't even understand with subtitles. Going back to the root of cinema and have ""silent film"" with just music and subtitles. Go and look up ""Confessions of a Christopher Nolan Fanboy"" on youtube to see why Nolan movies are getting more like the way they are now.

It's outstanding how they show us physic aspects that are scary and awesome at the same time, it was ABSOLUTELY complex, and I guess it was even more complex to write and direct, please, an Oscar for every person who put this piece of quantum work together, but, Nolan focused so much in complex aspects that he practically forgot of the humanity level, what we people follow him, or maybe it was a short film and they didn't have time to do it properly, I dont know, but I feel like there was no character development at all, the characters looked barely alive, the main actor, GOD, who is that guy? is he an actual actor?? I don't even know him, he acted like me, and that's not a compliment, Robert Pattinson should have been the main character, even his character was also bad constructed and souless, he got acting skills, I think that mistake was a HUGE thing, by the other hand, there are no hard stories, the kid and the mother were barely developed, I couldn't feel empathy for them, it was like a hard to watch film that had nothing else that a complex physic plot, which, I actually loved, I love sci fi, I studied physics, I love that theme, but, that's not enough for a film like this and with a great director like this, this is the first Nolan's film that I doubt I will watch more than once :/ the 3 points are only because of the EXTREMELY HARD WORK AND BRAIN BURNING the production suffered to make this film, but I would give it a 0 for the story.",Tenet
297,arabnikita,"Trully, a new level of cinematic experience.",9,28 August 2020,"Imagine studying PhD level physics at a night club in the middle of a war zone and everytime you begin to make sense of things, the lecture goes back in time. Essentially, Tenet is a spy movie about some agents trying to stop a global catastrophe. One thing that makes it unconventional is Christopher Nolan and his infinite creativity and skill as a filmmaker.Tenet is a meticulously crafted movie that utilizes every single second of it's run-time to create a packed experience unlike anything that has ever been attempted on screen. The film starts off with a deafening bang and a disorienting sequence of events. After that, it just keeps ramping up the pace in terms of information, action and effects. The colossal scale of this movie is unreal whether it is the practical effects, sound or locations. The action sequences are mind boggling in both creativity and execution.Christopher Nolan has never been a director to spoon-feed the audience and here, he simply threw away the spoon. At first, the complexity of it all seems so overwhelming as he keeps throwing information and action at you with minimal explanation and the characters discussing it doesn't make it any simpler. It's only after you actually see a few things, the events begin to make sense and when some of it finally clicks, the feeling is extraordinary.Tenet is Nolan's most complex film and it is humanly impossible to understand everything and connect all the dots in one watch. However, in the end, it is a movie and not a physics documentary. The key is not to try to grasp every little detail of time manipulation but to go with the flow and by the end you will have it figured out. Much like Inception this is a film that requires multiple viewings to get the full picture so I am definitely going back in a week to catch up on details, relive the entire experience and possibly bump it to 10/10.

300,FKDZ,Intriguing and Fun but lacking Character.,8,3 September 2020,"Walking out of the theatre I still had a few small questions, mainly some in between ''what/how'/plot holes'' but I understood it for about 90%. Still resulting in a fantastic movie. I think my experience with Season 2 of Westworld helped me understand the the way time works much quicker. Without it, I can certainly understand being confused for a much longer time.That said it clicked with me once the camera focused on that little orange strap on reverse time Neil's backpack. This shot was obviously meant to be a clue.Now the performances of the actors are mostly fantastic. I think Kat takes the throne. With Neil behind, Andre after and The Protagonist 4th. And that's not because his performance was bad by any means, it was just written very flat because his eventual final role makes sense for it to be flat so that his transformation would be less jarring. But that also hindered the movie a ton as he was the main focus. And the main critique I have of this movie is that it's just very serious, flat and to the point. Neil sometimes gets some lighthearted-ness in their, but not much.The main villain also felt just a bit lacking for me. Perhaps a bit in line with the main lead, he lacked that special flair to make him interesting.The score is AMAZING, BUT definitely a must watch in theatre or with a good bass-y home theatre. Because most of the suspense and elements used are bass. The impact of most of the action scenes would lose quite a lot without good bass. I say this because there isn't really a motif, or a recognizable tune in this movie. I can instantly think of the Inception or Interstellar theme, but not for Tenet.A thing I can't skip when talking about Tenet is the action, wow, Nolan has outdone himself with all the live action. It paid off, just the viscosity of the events are a thrill to watch. That said, the actual fights and choreography leave something to be desired (not regarding the forward/reverse sections). Also this movie is barely graphic at all and to my opinion it held some moments back.Further on the last final battle scene was intense, a sight to see and just amazing all around but felt messy. You really had no clue of what the enemy was doing at all. The main focus was on the good guys shooting at ''things''. There was no dynamic between the two sides. Which made the entire battle really lackluster in that department.Talking about that final battle scene, that's where the storyline also makes itself a little bit more complex. With Neil going backward and forward in time. In between the two teams going backward and forward.The editing and story overall was not that crazy interesting. And I wish we got more time with the forward/backward mechanic. The first half of the movie is pretty hectic and cuts very quickly between locations. This movie takes no time at all to show any sort of travel or passing of time. One shot you are in India, the next you are in London. That said the film looks really good visually. Shots are nicely set up and the lighting looked fantastic.Overall I recommend this movie, definitely have a good sound system though.
8/10 , negatives are lack of engaging characters and lack of dynamic during final battle.",Tenet
301,gk303007,An appreciable attempt,8,23 September 2020,"Frankly, to choose this movie in my playlist had only one reason - Christopher Nolan and on top of that, written and directed by him. And I also know, when it comes to him, he is master of getting work out from Characters, Screenplay and execution of the script.If it's not an adapted theory like The Dark Knight, it is definitely experimental and he has made a place in proving his theory; either time or quantum theory, dreams or showing a movie in both forward and backward direction. And as the theory prevails, this movie works on time inversion and you really need a lot of energy and dedication to understand what he really wants to emphasize.Let me jump to the pros and cons; as per my understanding:Pros:Theory of Inversion is depicted in a beautiful manner and apparently, we come across the cases when you start understanding what it was really all about, if you really had jotted down the earlier events in the movie.The mystery binds you till core and you remain to the edge of your seat.Only Nolan can think on how portray a character so that he speaks his lines backward and them to make sense.Overall, a totally original idea. At-least i had never come across any such instance where this concept is used before.Cons:Character building is an important factor in any movie and i had seen in his earlier movies, it was done in an appropriate and crisp way. In here, i felt it lagged behind and it became hard to correlate as to the overall reason of something happening. Or why a character want to do something.The background score could have been better.If the inversion theory worked at its level best, some places i found it required a little more garnishing. And because it is Nolan, so i am strict in apprehending this case.Overall, bravo to the creator and direction, and an original idea which came to us.",Tenet

303,Come-and-Review,Just watch it a second time.,10,1 September 2020,"Taking a look around on imdb I've seen several very misleading reviews about this film that claim that it overuses exposition, that it has too loud audio, that the action scenes weren't good enough etc. so I just had to give my thoughts on this film.Let's start with the claims that there's too much exposition. Compared to other Nolan films like Inception or Interstellar there is much less: in those films usually a character explains step by step what is going on, in Tenet there is no such character and there are only tidbits of information given by some lines of dialogue.
It is true that the first 40 mins are sort of ""worldbuilding"" scenes, but that's again something that Nolan had already done in the past: Inception spends nearly an hour to explain the dreams concept, Interstellar takes 40 mins before going to space etc.About the sound mixing: the audio is similar to Tenet, super loud, but when it overlaps on dialogue pieces it's always pieces of dialogue that are unnecessary: a man doing a tour of a facility and telling stuff that is irrelevant to the plot, while the character observes details of the alarm system, for example.A story is defined as well written when it uses all the elements it presents: believe it or not, upon a second rewatch I realised how deeply this thing goes into Tenet, everone and everything is related to the main topic and the plot. You have to be extra careful to look for the connections but they are there (even if just glimpses - it's a Nolan film, a puzzle to recompose).
Once you're able to reconstruct the whole thing, well, you'll realise that Tenet is much more complex than how you deemed it, and so are the action sequences. I'd like to repeat it: if something doesn't check out, you missed something, at the second view you'll understand it better. If being confused by a film means to you that the film itself is not good, well, remember the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that one was super confusing and I certainly didn't understand it the first time I've seen it, yet 2001 is considered a masterpiece.
Tenet may be the most complicated Nolan film: much is implied, much is hard to understand, little is explained clearly, yet details, short glimpses and elements suggest everything. Upon a first view, I wasn't sure if I understood the plot. Upon second view, I think I've understood it all.
So yes, go watch it a second time before judging.",Tenet

My god, another poor idiots deep film by Chris Convolutions Nolan.I imagine people who like this vapid trash coming out of the theatre, having their puny minds blown and going ""Whoa!!!"" with a Keanu Reeves accent, not realizing they have not remembered a single plot point of this flaccid cash grab.First of all, the main protagonist is a massive Gary Stu and the actor is a wooden as they get with his dead-pan dialogue. Also the audio is really bad. Also Nolans casual use of random incoherent mystical symbolisms is obvious, childish and tiring, spray-painting meaningless references to the sator-square everywhere like a chump. It is loathsomely void and dumb.The whole plot gimmick falls apart as soon as you actually have a think about it. Entropy and time are NOT THE SAME THING!!!! It simply does not work. But it works SO badly that it is used in every way possible. It has no actual rules, so it just is a free-for-all McGuffin for Nolan to wind around and around the waver thin plot in a desperate attempt to obfuscate and convolute the script to the point where paying attention starts to hurt and, for most people, lazy complacency takes over and they just absorb the spectacle of it without thinking.Unfortunately one can not blame obvious frauds like Nolan for his success. After all, if the public was not so hungry for empty meaningless escapism without substance, guys like that would be doing some horrid office job, not raping culture with their feeble media chud.It is a bad and forgettable movie.

310,mrpicky,respect the work BUT it has a lot of problems,5,11 September 2020,"Impressive screenplay but falls flat under any analysis. I am not even going to talk about time travel which is paradoxical and stupid. He might say that he avoided causality problems. But no he did not! But again that is not my problem with it. Fiction can force unrealistic ideas to use as artists tool for some bigger idea. And what was the idea here? Exactly! Nolans goal was clearly to write mind bending script instead of creating a good movie. He does not bring any ideas or amazing characters. it's just OCD filmmaker movie. Average camera. Poor music score. Good actors with pointlessly twisted but essential stupid script. It is very much like Bond or Who-done-it movie. Fun, unless you use any amount of critical thinking. And there are huge problems with Neil character and smaller goofs that conflict internal logic. So, movie just rotates around paradoxical concept and goes nowhere. No impressive characters, no music , story is just for the sake of story with stuff just thrown there.",Tenet
311,gcsman,Christopher Nolan does James Bond -- with time travel!,8,7 September 2020,"I have a huge amount of respect for director Christopher Nolan. His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.Among Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.In the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.So the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.For the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.So there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.",Tenet
312,PotassiumMan,"Ambitious and polished, but flawed Nolan metaphysical espionage thriller",7,20 September 2020,"The latest thriller from Christopher Nolan is a sprawling, international-scale spy film about a mercenary who is charged with the daunting task of preventing world destruction through a complex time loop. Handsomely shot, with imposing cinematography, globe-trotting locations and flamboyant visual effects, this film has the look and feel of Nolan's best work. The underlying concept at work here is labyrinthine to say the least.If you've seen any of Nolan's previous two or three films, then you are on notice about some of his more unique foibles as a director, some of which he majorly doubles down on in this one. From a highly intricate plot concerning time intervals to his puzzling penchant for scenes with unintelligible dialogue to his flare for thundering climactic sequences, this is the most Nolan-esque film I have ever seen. Everything I've come to know about him as a director, I saw here in abundance. That's both good news and bad.When the dialogue is incomprehensible as often as it is here, it's difficult to get invested in what's taking place. Here more than in any of his other films, Nolan allows this peculiar, noisy style of acoustics to pervade, which prevents us from connecting with the protagonists. The difficulty in even hearing what's being said is a flaw that Nolan allows to interfere with the storyline much too often. As for the special effects, they are exceptional even though toward the end, I found myself desensitized to their impact and growing impatient with the pacing.I cannot fault the performances. John David Washington, the spy at the heart of the assignment, is even more of a presence in this film than he was in BlacKkKlansman. Kenneth Branagh is a seething, formidable villain and Elizabeth Debicki is quite persuasive as the damsel-in-distress. Robert Pattinson is slightly under-utilized as Washington's partner, but quite compelling nonetheless. Michael Caine's part here amounts to little better than a cameo appearance. But all their acting chops can only do so much with a script that is at times lumbering, often disorienting and a bit too distant to truly resonate in any emotional way. If you let your mind wander even a little bit, you might lose your way. I always admire Nolan's eagerness to tackle challenging concepts in an exciting manner. Unfortunately here, it's possible that he might have bitten off more than he could chew. The end result is a film to be studied, if not necessarily adored. Recommended to those who are patient and open to repeat viewings.",Tenet
313,MovieBuff11732,A Fantastic Nolan Film Deserving Of Multiple Viewings,9,19 October 2020,"Tenet is the movie that had everybody pacing back in forth anxiously to see all the way back since 2017 when Dunkirk first came out. That year people were wondering what will the next big Nolan feature be? Now that moment is finally here for many people to enjoy.Tenet is about the protagonist (John David Washington) finding out about this technology named Tenet that will put people back in time. It isn't like you would expect though. The way that they go back in time is through rewinding everything around them. They do this so they can plant things in certain areas. Sounds confusing right? Also with that, Sator (Kenneth Branagh) is trying to get his hands on this technology and many people will believe that it will start a World War III. The hero gets his help from many people including Neil (Robert Pattinson), Mahir (Himesh Patel), Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), and many more people along the way.Tenet has been a film many people couldn't wait to experience for themselves. It is the newest film from Christopher Nolan. He has made so many marvelous master pieces in the past years such as Inception, The Dark Knight, and Memento. This film was triggering the same level of excitement as those for many people. Although I thought the film wasn't as well put together as those masterpieces. One thing many people keep dumping on this film is how confusing it is. It is a very complexed film. You need to watch this picture many times to fully understand what every line of dialogue means and what everybody is doing throughout the whole film. Although I don't think many people remember that you had to see Inception, Memento and even The Prestige multiple times to fully grasp the meaning of the movie. So I don't think that is a problem with this movie. The problem I found was the characterization. There isn't much of it throughout this picture. Neil (Robert Pattinson) doesn't get his backstory till the end of the picture which leaves you for the whole movie wondering what is he doing here? You don't even know what Michael Caine does in this film. Otherwise Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) and Saton (Kenneth Branagh) have a very well set up chemistry and is executed really well. Although the protagonist isn't really set up too well either until the end. Which is pretty annoying as well because he is the character that you follow. Many people have been wining about the fact that the main character doesn't have a name but that doesn't really matter to me. Clint Eastwood never had a name in the dollars trilogy and that never ticked people off.The action is probably a main thing many people come to this movie to see. As you might know this film doesn't use any green screen which is now hailed by many movie fans because of the overuse in movies such as Jumanji Welcome's To The Jungle and The Avengers movies. It is pretty cool to see a movie that does a lot of stuff practical. And I must say it is really impressive to see how they did those stunts in the behind the scenes clips you can find on the internet. The hand to hand combat is also really riveting. It is intense and gives you a blast of excitement. From this well placed action, you feel like this film never puts the breaks on ever. There was never a time in the movie I looked down at my phone to see what time it was. This film was very well paced from the action and intriguing story (although it is confusing upon first watch).The score is a main thing many Nolan fans were worried about coming into this film. As you might know Hans Zimmer was busy with another project during the time this one was getting made so Nolan brought on the young composer Ludwig Goransson. He was composed many other films and TV shows like The Mandalorian, Black Panther, and the Creed films. I have enjoyed the score for all of those projects so I was really excited to see what Ludwig Goransson would do for this film. Walking out the theater, I found it sounding the same as any other Nolan movie. It was still a great score, don't get me wrong but it was vastly similar to the score in Nolan's previous works. I don't know if Goransson thought it would make most sense for the score to sound like Hans Zimmer or if it was Nolan stepping in saying this is how I would like it to sound. It still sounded really well crafted though.Tenet is a very ambitious film that just barely misses the mark for what I wanted it to be. It had some really well put together action that has been lacking in recent films of the last couple years but failed to give an investing backstory for the leading characters which caused me the viewer, to not feel enthralled to follow them on this journey.",Tenet

318,bastille-852-731547,Christopher Nolan's Weakest Film,5,1 September 2020,"I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and also love spy movies, so needless to say, this was one of the my most anticipated films of the year. Sadly, I was extremely disappointed and think it's probably Nolan's weakest film.The plot centers around a spy (John David Washington) traveling the globe and utilizing ""time inversion"" to stop Sator, a Russian arms dealer thug (Kenneth Branagh.) As can be expected from a Nolan film, it contains stunning cinematography all over the globe--with unique wide and aerial shots throughout, especially in the first half. The film's score can also be very enthralling, such as a tense crescendo during the film's gripping opening scene in which the protagonist must lead a SWAT team to stop a terrorist attack on an opera house. Yet despite its grand scope and scale, the film ultimately feels unsatisfying. The first major problem with ""Tenet"" is that much of the story, especially in the second half, is too convoluted to really understand. Nolan's films have always been complex (which is a good thing,) but there is a difference between complexity and sophistication while delivering a coherent and thoughtful narrative (a la ""Inception"") and this. The concept of ""time inversion"" is not explained well or even executed in especially clever ways. The characters are also extremely thin and poorly developed. The other thing that is very unfortunate is that while Nolan clearly wanted to invert (no pun intended) clichés of the spy thriller genre, he ends up relishing in such clichés. For example, the Sator character is a cliché of the typical spy movie villain: tough-talking, thick-accented Russian, hard-drinking, violent, etc.Given how much I admire Nolan as a filmmaker, this film was ultimately a major disappointment for me despite its sheer ambition. 5/10",Tenet

Inverted world was interesting. All the missing pieces comes together as you go with the protagonist. The acting is great.

Denzel's son does a good job as a scrappy & smart ""protagonist"" with a unique screen presence compared to the archtypical ""tall, dark & handsome"" hero. Even as long as it is , the audience gets no more understanding of the ""reverse entropy"" technology than the film's characters do, who got it from their future. The establishment of ""policies"" to avoid potential temporal (existential) catastrophe and/or mind-blowing paradoxes, was the best they could do as they developed experience with it. That right there is an underappreciated director's technique of the characters in the film asking the same questions that the audience is asking at the same time.

323,Shostakovich343,Tenet,4,11 July 2021,"""Tenet"" is the film Christopher Nolan was bound to make one day -- a film in which all human interaction is reduced to the furthering of plot points and every beat is part of a towering narrative mechanism that serves no purpose but its own propulsion. The workings of its puzzle plot are no more engaging than those of a Rubik's cube: meaningless once put into the correct order.Telling comparison is provided by ""The Father"" (also 2020), another labyrinthine narrative with a form to match its content. Understanding how that film's story is structured directly impacts your understanding of the characters, and greatly enhances the sadness of their story. In ""Tenet"", meanwhile, unravelling the clews of sci-fi drivel only gives you a picture of what happened in the film, no deeper understanding of any kind. There is no room for profundity in a story without empathic dimension. You solve the puzzle for the sake of solving it.This leads me to believe that ""Tenet"" was meant as occupational therapy. Either for the kind of viewer who uploads hour-long analyses on YouTube, or for Nolan himself, who probably cannot put his enormous mind to rest. I hope he'll consider adapting someone else's script for his next film. He's a much finer director than a writer.",Tenet
324,hoernkeem,"Tenet (2020, Christopher Nolan) Nolan's latest outing too clever for its own good... becomes mired in its own physics",6,3 March 2021,"Tenet (2020, Christopher Nolan)
So this will be a tad SPOILER related although the spoiler is really only regarding major plot mechanics that are revealed in the film fairly quickly.
One of Hollywood's marquis high profile film makers returns with his most cerebral and ambitious film to date. This film also comes along at a horrible time as everything is now subject to the fallout of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Nolan's 'Tenet' is the first major motion picture released in theaters since the shutdown attempting to lure tentative yet starved audiences back to the multiplex. We will leave business and coronavirus aside and focus on the film.
The promotional material is cryptic regarding the plot of this film however with a director like Nolan who has done such films as 'Interstellar' and 'Dunkirk' I am at a point where as long as he is attached I will go see it. All that was clear is that time travel or time alteration would be a key component. John David Washington stars and Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh costar in this incredibly challenging movie. There is no doubt the film is well made and I am very confidant that if you sat down and were able to very slowly analyze it that the narrative would make very slick sense, but as an audience member watching this film in real time I found it almost incomprehensible.
Washington is an unnamed CIA agent and by virtue of a very selective ""test"" he is recruited by an ultra secret organization known only as Tenet. Very quickly Washington is introduced to what will be the key concept of the narrative and while simple when stated in action it becomes another matter altogether. He meets a scientist who shows him some objects they have found which have what she describes as inverted entropy. These are objects that instead of traveling through time as we know it (i.e. forward) are traveling backwards through the timestream (or at least that is how I understood it). From here we are introduced to an antagonist known as Sator played by Branagh and his wayward spouse Kat played by Debicki. Sator plans no less than the destruction of the world somehow using this inverted entropy technology. Washington enlists Pattinson as his second and they begin a spygame with Sator. His wife gets wrapped up in the whole affair as Washington attempts to use her to get to Sator, but the matter is further complicated as he develops feelings for her. As far as basic spy stories go it really isn't that dynamic.
What really throws the characters and the audience for a loop is the timestream technology. Not only do they find objects that are traveling in reverse they find gateways known as turnstiles that allow objects, including people, to become inverted and vice versa. Sound confusing? Trust me it gets there pretty quickly. Pretty soon you have characters going back and forth traveling forward and backward in the same scenes and the climax involves a pretty extensive raid combining multiple teams utilizing this concept to a mental breaking point. While the visuals can be pretty amazing with this the concept it is just too much to bog down your brain with while trying to assess everything. They have a few times where they are explaining the technology basically for the benefit of the audience although it is pretty organic in the narrative but even these tutorials are not enough to really figure out how things are functioning. At some point you just sort of throw your hands up, stop trying to figure it out and just play off the cues of the characters. Oh the protagonist liked that. Good! If the bad guy does that the world will be destroyed? What? Okay.... Sure.
This is a difficult film to critically assess because it is technically very well done and I believe if you slow everything way down and are explained everything on a point by point basis the plot will make complete sense. Unfortunately Nolan winds up being a bit too clever for his own good as the concept is just too far reaching to really be accessible for an audience watching a movie in the moment. You can watch it and even enjoy it, but I can't help feel a lot of the nuance of the narrative just blew right by me, and in that nuance, I believe are the keys to truly understanding and enjoying the film.
Eric's Grade: C+",Tenet
325,RIK-22,"Nolans best movie by far, but still a mixed bag",6,9 December 2020,"I will start by saying I dislike most Nolan movies, but conversely, I love the ideas behind most of his films. All his projects try to be clever (with the emphasis on try) yet fall very short. They also suffer from being a bit soulless and empty, clinical, if you will. There are usually a bucket of plot holes and for some reason the start of his movies are pretty boring.Both Inception and the awful Interstellar were examples of this.I will also add, I genuinely admire his technical ability as a filmmaker and I want to like his films, the ambitious subject matters he addresses are right up my street.Tenet is the first Nolan film, I have liked. It is the first film where I have not found myself rolling my eyes in shock about how bad the features were. I got interested in this and wanted to see every part of it and to try to understand it (which is a big ask). I have generally found his previous stuff, dumb, yet trying to be clever.Now this is very far from a 10/10 movie, but I do think it is the best thing Nolan has done (most of his other films are below 4/10 for me).
The problems are:
Some smart arses (liars, let us be honest) say it is understandable. To be frank, it is extraordinarily complicated and hard to get your head around. I would not say it is impossible, but you would need lots of diagrams and re-watches to really get it.Mumbling dialog, what is with Nolan and his sound issues. I would like to hear what the actors are saying.The beginning of the film needed a re-write, far too drawn out, largely needless scenes at the start that could have been much more effective, if trimmed down.Standard paradox stuff, obviously by killing the Kenneth at the start, many other events would not have occurred that resulted in other actions.Motivations, it was very hard to know why people were doing what they were doing, what was the big battle scene at the end, who was fighting whom, there did not seem to be anyone other than two teams there. They blew up an empty building for some reason. What was the benefit of the time pincer operation at the end?Couldn't they have just gone back in time and killed Kenneth themselves rather than the convoluted, unnecessary use of the wife. Just blow him up and his boat some time in the past.The driving scene did not make much sense, why would the forward car effectively follow the reversing car (if you get what I am saying). The reversing car chased the forward driving car, as we learnt, if you are in the reverse-universe, you appear to be going backwards, yet both cars are in sync.However, the reverse/forwards scenes were amazing, it must have taken a huge effort to get those right. I did follow the plot right up to the end, it did retain my interest, the first Nolan film to do so.I will give it a 6, maybe generous, but I did find it interesting.",Tenet

333,dcobbimdb,Interesting take on a time travel movie,7,17 November 2020,"Is it worth seeing in the theaters? Yes, especially in Dolby if you have the chance. This movie thrives with good sound and I know with Covid many aren't going to the theaters, but I'm glad we did...As other reviews might lead you to believe, this movie is confusing as hell. Don't feel bad if you see it and say ""What the heck just happened?"" It's intentionally confusing, with a broken timeline where you start off having no idea what's going on, and slowly as the movie evolves you understand more and more and by the end you'll probably get the overall plot, but not much else. Now I have bad hearing so I'm real hit and miss going to theaters, even with loud sound. Most things I watch with headphones or subtitles, however my daughter said the dialog was hard to follow so I guess I wasn't alone.But if you're like me after it's done, and hours later when your mind is still jello, go online and just search for tenet explained and a whole lot more will make sense. Or just wait another 6 months till you can rewatch the movie again and again until it makes sense, which I'll probably do as well. I do not recommend reading spoilers before seeing it or it will ruin a big aspect of the movie.If you've seen previews or at least read the synopsis, then you get that this is an action movie involving some weird ""time"" stuff, and I'm not going to say anymore than that, other than it's a somewhat original take on it, which is refreshing. That said like most movies that involve some sort of time manipulation you have to dispel belief and just go with it and that's no different here. Now whether or not it being so confusing and hard to follow is intentional to the point where it hides flaws, I couldn't really say until I've watched it a few more times, and with headphones or subtitles so I can actually make out what's being said.Overall it's a good action movie if nothing else, and definitely worth a watch on the big screen if you feel comfortable, if not it's still a good movie on your home TV, just be prepared to not get it the first time or be asking a lot of questions after. But I will say it's entertaining, and a somewhat original take on the idea and I will see it again",Tenet
334,andrew-hill515,Kind of pants,4,30 August 2020,"How to make Tenet:
Step 1: Cool looking visuals
Step 2: Pseudo intellectual excuse for the visuals
Step 3: ProfitI can see why Nolan wanted to wait for a cinema release.
Without the big screen in a cinema with the huge surround sound you would probably notice more easily that the film is stupid. Really stupid.Rules get established, then shown, then sort of changed when convenient, then sometimes abandoned without explanation.Such as they need a piece, then all the pieces, then no pieces of a McGuffin for time travel.Then only future dudes can invert stuff, which you dig up from time capsules. Then that's not a thing then it is and isn't depending on the scene to have motivation.Inversion is for items only, then it's perception only, then it's time travel for people, then it's super common and entire teams do it all the time.It's things moving backwards, then it's perception of things moving backwards, then it's full on time travel.For instance, there is a word and a sign that will open the right doors and the wrong ones... Which is used once on a woman who would have spoken with the guy anyway. Then it never comes up again. I have no idea what the point was.Another total fail is the boat scene; neither version of the blonde woman needed oxygen so that the scene can exist at all, but before that scene it was mandatory to not have your lungs explode or to avoid asphyxiation or something.Overall I would say it was a JJ Abrams level of being cool looking but with a poor and ill-thought-out script.",Tenet
335,kitewizard,"For such a budget, it's amazingly terrible",3,2 December 2020,"The story is good.
Terrible casting for several roles, but great stunts and fighting, which is why I gave it the third star.
John, the lead seems to have been a Hollywood, race-charity, because of the glowing, media praise of the film. His acting is incongruous to several of the other actors.This story is extremely difficult to tell in 2.5 hours.
As a 20 hour series, it could have been good, maybe.If you enjoy having no idea what is going on or why, and random dialogue and fighting are cool, then you might like the movie.
Also, if you like watching movies, many times over, to try and figure out what they are about, this one might be good, because it's probably not possible to figure out.
It's just a slurry of sci-fi concepts, and bad characters. It belongs on the sci-fi channel.If you want a really disjointed, good, movie that throws you for a loop, see ""Memento.""",Tenet

I have had my second viewing of Tenet and maybe it's just me but The Last Scene still makes absolutely no sense to me(Protagonist and Priya) There is no indication throughout the whole movie at all that He Masterminded anything.Also the Neil issue.If John Connor Is killed then he cannot do anything in the Future Right? So what about Neil.I have heard some people say it was a Time Loop but that's too confusing and who would knowingly sign up for a Damn Time Loop?Another suggestion that was put up was that, well he's known Protagonist for years and he did all that just to save him at the Opera because Protagonist was THE Eventuality in the First Place.Others say it's a Multiverse and that is Plausible but would make it kind of drawn out.Another thing is, couldn't they have shown that Ives was from the Future better than that? It was way too Abrupt and like oh well, I guess we will just go with it.What is the Deal with the Russian? Is he trying to reverse time to reverse his issue so that he can live? Or Maybe reverse time so that the nuclear incident he went through doesnt happen?It can't be, he is just trying to blow up the world, how ridiculous is that?Also the turnstiles, What is up with them? It was completely weird and out of nowhere.Highlights° That Last Quarter of the Movie with all those Hidden Gems was so Entertaining.° The Inversion is Incredible to watch at Times.° That Hallway Fight Scene Is Absolutely Incredible, the Movement is out of this World.° The Soundtrack is Awesome, I swear some of the sounds were weird, it was Brilliant.Overall, Look you are either going to get it or you won't and for me you have to assume quite a few things.

He makes great movies but you don't get to sit back and relax, you got to put the work in to get the benefit. This is no different, but (just like Interstellar) it's just too damn clever for its own good. The time travel aspect becomes confusing but some of the backwards scenes are a heck of a ride though.I didn't really know the lead, John David Washington, but he does a great job here and I was pleasantly surprised to see he is the son of the great Denzel.Overall, a bit too clever and a bit too long, would have benefited from a better edit (particularly the second half).

Christopher Nolan's direction and the performances of the actors are all fantastical, but unlike Interstellar or Inception the film does little to keep your interest in the first third, which is all fine and good once the ball starts rolling, but the way the film is structured and the tone presented in, makes for a confusing and rather dull first part. Despite the efforts of John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Dybecki the film at times still feels like a chore. Once again I cannot stress how great the last two thirds are and I think will improve the film upon a second viewing, when it comes to Nolan the creativity is admirable, but I wouldn't dare rank this among his best.",Tenet

I typically love what the guy has to offer, and before when people complained about the confusing plot in his movies like Inception or Interstellar, I never understood what they meant because to me those two movies are nearly perfect.
So, I am shocked at how much I didn't enjoy this film based on my expectations going in. NOTHING happens for a big chunk of time and then we just go back to those scenes again after a while. Nolan is also still incredibly bad at writing female characters as anything but a punching bag or a damsel in distress.
John David Washington is great in this, I hope to see more from him but his characters is just so bland. Everyone else does a fine job acting as well but no actor could have saved this boring and confusing script.
When most of the audience doesn't understand your movie, it's not the audience's fault when the plot is also this boring and self-indulgent to begin with. I could not have cared less about what happens at the end if I tried. Just pure meaningless explosions going back and forth.
Not watching this again but Nolan gets a pass I suppose for me, since this is the first movie I have not liked from him. It's shot well, the score is decent, the acting is fine but everything else is a miss.",Tenet
343,samyoung-82648,Least favourite Nolan,6,31 August 2020,"Honestly, this film pushed politics too hard for my liking. It failed on two major fronts. Firstly, it's too similar to his other works. Secondly, the movie was very distracting because of the (ahem) politics.
The story itself was fine. Nolan had one central idea that he exploited in limited ways. Debicki was Kat was a huge letdown (and quite frankly, very irritating). The music was annoying (which is unusual because I usually love the music in Nolan films).
This film's greatest strength is its locations and visuals. Once you strip that away, there's not a lot left.
Be prepared to be disappointed if you're a Nolan fan. If you haven't watched anything Nolan, you may like this movie.
Inception was a masterpiece. This film was mediocre in so many ways. It's still worth seeing, just lower your expectations.",Tenet
344,theredsky,Tenet Review,7,6 September 2020,"Probably Nolan's most confusing film but I was digging it. Nolan once again knocks it out of the park in the technical category. All the practical effects here are amazing. Especially the plane sequence and the war sequence. I'm genuinely impressed and curious about how he was able to do some of this stuff since the movie deals with time inversion. There's a lot of stuff going forwards and backwards in a scene and I really want to know how Nolan did it. The cinematography is fantastic as always and the score is great. Hans Zimmer is missed here but I think Ludwig Göransson did an excellent job doing his own thing while also throwing in elements of Zimmer in there too. The editing can feel a little bit awkward at points but it's good for the most part and the sound editing is great. The only issue in the technical category I have is the sound mixing. Unfortunately, Nolan decides to turn the mixing up a little too loud during important scenes and it can be hard to hear what some of the actors are saying. Speaking of actors, almost everyone here does a great job with John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Debicki being standouts. There isn't a lot of depth to their characters which can mute some of the emotional weight at points but it wasn't a huge issue for me. The plot is unique and different but definitely is incredibly confusing and will most likely require rewatches to fully comprehend it. If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan or want to see something in theaters, I urge you to check this out.",Tenet

346,Rino_Bortone,AUDACITY AT ITS FINEST. ANOTHER NOLAN'S AMAZING JOURNEY.,8,11 December 2020,"Nolan once again does not disappoint and confirms himself as one of the best filmmakers of the century with his ingenuity and his crypticity. A lot of creativity and a lot of substance, with the usual impeccable direction and the mastery of the full-fledged shots, with an almost maniacal arrangement and capture of details. Inviting, searing, intricate and complex plot dominate throughout the film, guiding minds to the end, leaving more questions than answers, but this is Nolan's strong point: explaining the inexplicable and not explaining the explainable. Perfect cast with two talented young men, already confirmed elsewhere as such, John David Washington and Robert Pattinson who lead the film with excellent commitment; honorable mention to the timeless Kenneth Branagh who always manages to demonstrate his indisputable versatility and finally a decoration of pure female talent with the talented Elizabeth Debicki. Film that finally manages to take, conquer and intrigue, despite some hasty explanation of the concept of TENET itself and its subplots, we expected only a little more in-depth analysis and maybe some little more expectations from Nolan, but in conclusion, this film is nothing more than the umpteenth fantastic vision of Nolan.",Tenet
347,pritol,Mind boggling and brilliant...I think.,8,10 January 2021,"Another astounding Nolan masterpiece! Incredible cinematography and editing, beautiful locations, soundtrack which keeps you on the edge of your seat, A-list cast who all deliver incredible performances, and a story line which is quite challenging / mind-boggling! (As you would expect).John David Washington, shows he can be a true leading man, stepping out confidently from his father Denzels shadow. Elizabeth Debecki again puts out a magnetic performance, Kenneth Branagh is terrifying as the main ""bad guy"" playing a Russian billionaire with secrets, anger issues and a very dark side to him (and fantastic beard)! However the best performance is from Robert Pattinson, smooth, charming, and riveting...similar to Tom Hardy's Eames in Inception. He truly is a million miles away from his Twilight days.To say this is the weakest film Nolan has put out, is a huge disservice to the film itself. Any other film maker delivering a film of this quality would be delighted and incredibly well received. The only issue is that Nolan's bar and track record is so high that the statement does hold true.As mentioned the plot is a little mind boggling at times, and the film moves at such a pace with such little explanation of events, that it is quite hard to follow sometimes. That's not to say there aren't some really well structured moments, that leads back to earlier events laced with symbolic meaning, it's more the literal plot line.The whole thing feels a little rushed...if it had an extra 20-30mins to pace itself then it would score an extra point or two.

350,joshbarton15,"""next level stuff in terms of innovative filmmaking""",9,28 August 2020,"Time is relative. Relative to everyday life but also relative to Christopher Nolan's filmography; piecing together a fractured timeline in Memento, cheating time in the mindblowing Inception, bending time and travelling through wormholes in space in Interstellar, and the ticking clock as time ran out to save the stranded soldiers in Dunkirk. His latest, Tenet, forges a narrative based around time and the results really are quite something to behold.Armed with only one word, Tenet, the Protagonist (John David Washington) sets about on a mission to fight for the survival of the entire world. It's a journey of international espionage and a mission that will unfold in time, just not as we all know it.Tenet comes with a whole heap of expectations with the fact that it is the latest from Christopher Nolan but combine that with the notion that it will be the film a lot of people return to the cinema for since the Coronavirus pandemic shut them down earlier in the year, and it arrives with even more of a fanfare. Expect the unexpected from Nolan with every film he makes but with Tenet he takes it to new extremes because it really is next level stuff in terms of innovative filmmaking.Getting into the plot of Tenet too much would make my head spin more than it did when I was walking out of the cinema but I can say that once I had the time to walk away and really think about it, Nolan really has created a film that challenges its audience to really think about what they are watching. There's plenty of exposition throughout however, you still have to pay plenty of attention to the details or you could find yourself in limbo.It's another Nolan film that plays around with time but Tenet does so in a way that I don't think anyone would be able to say they've seen before. The action sequences are simply breathtaking, flowing both forwards and backwards in time, sometimes even at the same time. The ingenuity of it all is astounding and the idea of trying to choreograph fights and car chases backwards hurts my head enough yet alone actually executing it flawlessly, so there has to be a special mention to the stunt teams involved.Tenet is led by a magnetic performance from John David Washington, who is quickly becoming one of the most exciting screen presences around. His physicality in such a demanding role really shines through as does his undeniable charisma, giving his father Denzel a run for his money in that department. Robert Pattinson has forged an incredible career for himself after the Twilight series and as the blandly named Neil he brings a lot to a character who could just be seen as very throwaway, saving the heavy hitting for when we see him cracking skulls in The Batman next year.Elizabeth Debicki is the best of the supporting cast as Kat, trapped in a loveless marriage and held against her will by her villainous husband Andrei Sator, played by Kenneth Branagh, who thankfully doesn't ham it up as much as when he played the villain in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the man everyone forgot was in the film as a military commander and it's good to see Himesh Patel doing so well for himself after years of playing the nerdy Tamwar Masood in EastEnders.I didn't find myself taking to Ludwig Goransson's score so much throughout the film, obvious similarities to some of Hans Zimmer's work on previous Nolan films holding it back. The one major complaint I have with Tenet, and I feel it was always going to eventually happen in a Nolan film, was that there were a few moments where it was just too loud and dialogue was being drowned out by an incredibly uneven sound mix.That being said, Tenet marks a return to the cinema in quite triumphant fashion. It's big, loud and easily Nolan's most ambitious film to date, crescendoing to yet another emotional, if rather subtle this time round, finale that will make you sit back in your seat and feel like you've just had a cinematic experience like no other.",Tenet
351,martinpersson97,Another masterpiece by Nolan,10,26 August 2020,"Much mystery and anticipation led up to the release of Christopher Nolans new thriller, and it definitely did not disappoint. I can't say it exceeded expectations, since basically everything Nolan touches becomes art, and this is not an exception.Directors of these kinds of movies likes to play around with chronology, and this one takes it one step further, making things that happen simultanious, and yet out of order - it feels more in tune with Inception, Memento and The Prestige than The Dark Knight or Dunkirk.The special effects are fantastic and complements the narrative in effective ways, and so does the characters and the actors portraying them, one character stands out as one you may hate a lot.The plot was a mystery before release, and frankly, still is. It is not a straightforward tale, so it does not work for everyone, much like Nolan's other works, it requires thinking an analyzing to be appreciated, and if you give it just that, you can't help but love it.Hopefully this will end up on IMDb's Top 250 list after more have rated it!",Tenet

355,i_odin,Classic Nolan with hits and misses,7,11 December 2020,"Tenet is as ambitious as any other Nolan film out there (or perhaps even more) and there is no doubt about that. It has all the necessary ingredients that one can find In a Nolan film.Whoever has watched the trailer will be aware of the fact that the film's USP is its unique idea, but to those who haven't watched the film, the film has surely more to offer than that.Mindbending action (reminiscent of Inception but in a much larger scale), trendy score, beautiful cinematography -- this film ticks all the boxes.But having said that, the film has its fair share of misses too. Nolan's films are known for their strong emotionally driven characters. Be it Inception's Dom or Intersteller's Cooper or even Alfred and Robert in Prestige. All those characters are strongly driven by pure human emotions and that in turn connects the audience with those characters. Nolan's films are mindbending and often trendsetting but they also have simple and pure human emotions present for binding them all and creating magic on screen. Tenet, unfortunately DOES NOT have those.None of the character has strong emotional backing nor do anyone goes through a prominent arc. All the characters are surprisingly dejected and indifferent with little to none human bonding and conflict. Washington's performance (along with others) doesn't create magic. Sometimes the dry humour among characters is out of tune of the over all narrative.Even the plot disappoints, although Nolan is not known for making plot-heavy films. But still Tenet's narrative is out of depths. One strong idea is apparently not enough to lift otherwise bland and
mundane plotting.Overall the film could be watchable once (twice if not understood in first watch) for its idea, but unfortunately does not have the magic to be one of the best of what Nolan has created until now.",Tenet

The problem...this film is incredibly hard to follow. The ""time travel"" aspect, which was really ""inverted time"" or moving in reverse, was an interesting plot but the movie was very convoluted. That, in and of itself, wouldn't have been too bad if you could have understood what was being said. Between the heavy accents, fast pace, and conversations through their military gear/masks, you can only grasp about 30% to 40% of the dialogue, and the verbal communication is key to understanding what the heck is going on. That being said, the acting was impeccable. This is the type of film you'd typically want to rewatch to catch everything you missed the first go-around but honestly, with the manic script, frenzied editing, many plot holes, and dialogue problems, I'm not sure I'd bother.

And from start to finish, this is what keeps the viewers engrossed... not because they care about the characters or the plot, but to try and figure out how this universe works. This is its biggest asset and also its greatest strength. And every technical aspect that compliments this... from the VFX to Sound and set design, are done masterfully to bring life to this crazy concept.But the story that is built around this idea is very 2-dimensional and depthless. The characters are almost robotic in their motivations, as if being programmed by the writers to obey the personalities that come with being a cliché good guy or bad. But though this be the case, neither the plot nor the character developments were able to overpower the concept that they compliment, and therefore pretty much never ends up hindering the viewing experience in any way.It was a fun movie overall, but is definitely one of Nolan's weaker films.",Tenet

All movies which face with this argument tend to fall in absurdities, incongruities and contradictions unable to manage the events. So happens in this one. This movie exceeds in absurdity. At a certain point a person moving in the present-past, who should see the past people in reverse deals with them in forward. Nolan treats the argument by forward and reverse commands, but at a certain point the movie falls in stupidity because of the too many absurdities. I save just a movie based on the time travel: the terminator. But also in this one: the first time of the loop, John Connor's father who was? First of all, time is a human convention used to measure the events and the change. It's not like the space. What humans live is the present. If the past could be changed humans would not be responsible of their actions, not only, everyone could change their events also changing the other lives irreversibly. Would be an endless chaos. Why this movie is stupid: it is just focused on the aim to amaze the viewer making believe the viewer to not understand the logic of the plot. Indeed, what is absurd cannot be understood. Nolan fails because he tries to manage a complex argument increasing its complexity. Just an example: the viewer sees the meeting between the present event and the event coming from future intertwined by reverse and forward way but the woman which goes in the past interacts in forward way. Ahahahah. Now how many of the same woman are in the same place? Where they should live to live?

I found it confusing and the characters incredibly dull at the beginning. But after a while, I did find myself getting more engaged with the story. You have to really follow it or you will get completely lost with what's happening. It's definitely not a movie you can watch while doing something else. The visual effects were cool and it was well acted. I think the time could've been trimmed down a bit, but all in all I'm glad I watched it.",Tenet
367,seanhmoss6,This is the same reason I didn't like Momento,7,20 June 2021,"A spectacular concept which became too muddled. The film has great pacing for the first half. As usual, Christopher Nolan has one of the greatest actors never seen on screen star in this film, Hans Zimmer.As the movie progressed into the second half, in my opinion, the pace seemed to slodge through mud. The script became too weak.I know it is a very good film. I just didn't care during the last half. Wanted it to just end.That said, WATCH THIS MOVIE.",Tenet
368,mattrochman,To much complexity for a complex concept,5,28 March 2021,"Chris Nolan's wife said that Leonard DiCaprio made a very big contribution to the script from Inception. In a nutshell, it sounded like Leo found the original script to be too complex and confusing for the viewer, and helped them pull back to a script and series of scenes that the relatively intelligent audience member can understand, appreciate and enjoy.... even if somethings require a second watch or a long thought at dinner after the movie.Tenet is a good example of no one picking up Nolan's script and not pulling it back and doing the same thing done with Inception.Enough has been said about the sound issues with the film - definitely if you run it through a good home theatre system, the voices are under done while the background noise is massively overbearing.But the main issue of this film is that it took a workable time-travel concept and added some unnecessary complexity to it. Further more, it ran a questionable plot with emotional dimensions and character motivational complexity that made things even more baffling, but for no great payoff or benefit in the end.I do ""get it"" and appreciated Nolan taking on the challenge, but topping it all off with the temporal pincer move is really where the whole thing became way too complicated for the viewer to piece together on the first viewing.I watched it 3 times and while the second time helped me clarify or correct my understanding of various elements, I actually decided the film was over done on the third viewing and lowered my opinion of it.I'd love to write up what they should have done, but let's just say that the plot line need to be simpler so the focus on the temporal concepts were given better treatment.",Tenet
369,Keemshave,An extremely challenging film.,9,7 September 2020,"Tenet is a very complicated film and I definitely felt that overwhelming confusion during my 1st viewing. However, after the 2nd time I was able to grasp so much more and truly appreciate what Nolan was going for.This is by no means a perfect movie and is not particularly one of my favorite movies by Nolan, atleast not yet...perhaps this film will only get better with repeat viewings.Some of the exposition given to audience is heavy-handed and can be alot to process. The nature in which many of the characters communicate does not come off as completely natural and can definitely throw you off. I cannot wait to watch this on blu-ray so I can put subtitles on to decipher all of the dialogue and grasp everything going on in each scene.Despite this minor flaw I had, the film picks up to a super fast pace during the second half of the film and had my eyes glued to the screen. Some of the stuff Nolan does with the camera is ingenious. Truly some of the coolest scenes I've experienced at the theatres.All technical film making aspects are top notch besides maybe some of the sound mixing as it can muffle some of the essential dialogue between characters.Overall, I had a really good time during my first view and a great time during my second. I don't think this is one of Nolan's masterpieces, but I do think it is a smart action spy thriller with cool twists and turns.",Tenet

Cuz John Wick 1 is one of my top 10 movies of all time. But when I saw the movie finally I was disappointed.The story and the characters in the film tenant are not even close to John wick. John wick is the bogeyman for goodness sake! Tenet main character is just a hero who'll save ppl from ppl in the future.That being said I don't think the comparison is fair because they're two different categories. I did not notice that this film was sci fi Until 20 minutes of it.The idea is not very compelling to me. That someone in the future is making bullets that could travel past time to kill certain enemies but then certain people have abilities to use those bullets for their benefits and those people who would use those bullets would walk backwards drive backwards.I vaguely understood it but it's just not for me.Many reviewers are saying you have to watch the film twice to really like it. Well. In my perspective simplicity is key i dont think making the film complicated to the point were the viewer has to watch it a few times to like it is good for it. I see the contrary.Overall:
Film has Complicated features.Not a major fan of the idea/story.A little bit boring
Not into sci fi that much.I was going to give it a 6 out of 10. But the last 7 minutes boosted the film to 7 out of 10. Yes. I enjoyed the ending that much.",Tenet

Only two action pieces that you'll forget as soon as you leave the multiplex, and they only seem like fillers to move along the story somewhat. If you thought 'Dunkirk' was awful, it almost seems like David Lean next to this mess. Call this a 'social distancing' movie. Just socially distance yourself FAR away from this fiasco.

Tenet sees Nolan exploring his favourite concept ""Time"" in reserve flow which is Time Travel but with ""objects"" moving in reverse. Like every other Time Travel film Tenet also has its unanswered paradoxes.John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debecki and Kenneth Brannagh completely knocked it with their performances. Ludwig's score is so good that you wouldn't miss Hans Zimmer in a Nolan film. Tenet definitely is bound to win multiple best editing and best visual effects awards. The biggest disappointment is the sound mixing, in some parts of the film it's very hard to understand the dialogue with the background noise.The name Tenet a palindrome itself gives away a major spoiler in the film. It's best to watch the film without thinking too much about how the reversal flow of time works as it's not the key part of the film but just the way the world is set in. This requires multiple viewings and with each viewing you would like it more. Tenet is not Nolan's Bond movie but rather his latest addition to the universe of Time after Memento, Inception and Interstellar.",Tenet

The piece that your present self thinks it needs is already taken by the future or past. Try solving that.It's no surprise Nolan was able to tell this utterly confusing multi linear reverse jumbled story and put it on screen. Whether the execution was perfect or not is subjective. For me, the spectacle on screen was so awesome I didn't or couldn't pay attention to the details and logic. On second viewing I could absorp a little more. My third viewing made me appreciate the acting, film making, cinematography and just the visual stitching more. I know the what, the why and the when ... The how is still .. uh nevermind.Yes the sound design is more weird this time. Background score, sound FX overshadows dialogues and other stuff so good thing I always watch a movie with subtitles. Fhehehe.Clearly this movie isn't for everyone. And to be honest I don't think this counts as a piece of entertainment. If you're renting or buying tickets for this, make sure you know what you're investing your time and money into. This is 80% Nolan flexing his story telling prowess and 20% what just happened. Call it pretentious or oversmartness but this movie exists and no one can or should recommend anyone to watch it. Make your own decisions.",Tenet
381,chong_an,"Preferably, see the spectacle in IMAX",7,2 September 2020,"This is an action movie where you can't think too hard, because it then won't make sense. At its heart is technology that makes time reversal possible - you can (slowly) go back in time, but not jump around in time quickly. Still, that can give interesting special effects, when the forwards and backwards time streams occur ""simultaneously"". The ""grandfather paradox"" is mentioned in passing, but the whole movie is such a paradox.

Tired of Christopher NOlan at this point...",5,6 December 2020,"I've seen Tenet, Interstellar, Inception and The Prestige because I'm drawn to ""science fiction"" in general. Christopher Nolan's modus operandi is pretty clear at this point in my opinion: take a high level but perhaps difficult to work with concept and make THAT the film's MacGuffin. In other words, he's a sci-fi faker. The front and center concept is just an irrelevant plot device.In The Prestige, it was Tesla's absolutely world changing invention. In Inception it was the fantastical dream sharing device. In Interstellar it was all of human existence on the line. And in Tenet, it's time travel and an attack from our future generations. In all these cases we are presented with those amazing and limitless concepts and made to believe they are what the films are about. Uh, NO. In all cases it's obvious Christopher NOlan couldn't actually handle the concepts so he just dropped back into the safe zone and we get just a normal drama/thriller with a thin, fake sci-fi wrapper.Tenet is really simple, you go in a spinning thing and when you come out you're traveling the other direction through time. There is talk of reversing entropy, but it's physics gibberish and it's better to think you're just moving backwards through time. OK, awesome, the ideas we could cook up around this concept are massive. Again, NO, we just get an idiotic story about a guy who wants to end the world because he's dying. You could have just had his kill switch on some huge nuclear arsenal or a deadly virus sprinkled around the globe and left the time travel out of it. What a complete waste of time, hah.In reality the fights between people going forwards and backwards in time are pretty stupid. It makes far more sense to simply go backwards in time through the event but just observe, and then reverse again so you're going forward. Then you could know what will happen first-hand instead of relying on scarce intel.Also the oxygen masks and other feeble scientific explanations were idiotic and just further solidify my claim that Christopher NOlan has no grasp of the concepts he's leveraging to try to be cool. Even The Big Bang Theory did a better job of pretending they knew what they were talking about.",Tenet

At first I'm not even sure how to write a review about this movie! Complex, strange and annoying at times, and I cannot even tell if the scenario is smart or is it just complicated?
On the positive side, the acting was perfect, especially in terms of Robert. And his acting is perfect. This is clearly his best movie ever.

The union of backwards timelines, makes the whole movie rather complex but not incomprehensible, despite the obvious paradoxes of time travel.The movie is extremely well done, meticulous, and full of action. Nolan manages to create original and unpredictable movies like the shared (matrioska) dreams in ""Inception"", and it is not the first time he has played with time travel as seen in ""Interstellar"", but in this movie he takes the concepts of time travel a step further by introducing behind the usual time travels, not just overlap time travel but also timeline that goes backwards by an entropy algorithm.Yes, it's clearly cerebral, but spectacular to recreate and to watch.Underrated",Tenet

It never made any sense to me.3) I never saw them get what they were after in the tunnel, so I don't understand how they stopped anything.I would really like to understand this, but too much didn't make sense.

390,DrTuvok,Phony controversy like everything else,7,7 February 2021,"Well, now Christopher Nolan has completed his mind-mush trilogy of reality, space, and time (Inception, Interstellar, and Tenet respectively). I appreciated Tenet a lot more than Interstellar, if only for the mind-boggling plotting that was beyond what any other director is even trying to do. Comic author PG Wodehouse once said something along the lines of 'whatever people say about my work, I want them to admit that I have worked excruciatingly hard on the plot'. The same principle applies to Tenet. You may be bored with it, you may despise it, but good grief, look at all the intricate detailing that Nolan must have diagrammed and charted just to get the script for this thing finalized. Other 'I'm so great' pretentious directors don't even try to go to these kind of extremes.The phony controversies around this film also raise it in my esteem. It was released during 'the GLOBAL PANDEMIC' (you know what I'm referring to), which caused a lot of hand-wringing from dweebs too chicken to see it in theaters. (I saw it in the theaters with no problem and didn't get sick afterwards; and there was almost nobody in the theater to spread disease anyway.). Nolan was slammed left and right as a literal madman trying to murder audiences for money. Give me a break. People should be allowed to use their own judgement to decide whether to go to a freaking movie theater or not.Then there's the sound mixing. The dialogue was a little hard to understand sometimes (I heard one of the first lines as 'we live in a toilet world') but only in some scenes, not throughout the whole movie like people were complaining. I think this criticism originated from people furious that it got a theatrical release and desperate to slam it any way they could.As a final side-note, what is up with this anti-theater conspiracy that is all over the Internet? Is it funded by the streaming services, which want to dominate pop culture with a flood of mediocre 'content'? People keep saying now that 'movie theaters are dead' but when a boring slop like Avengers Endgame can become the highest grossing movie the year before, this statement rings false. There is something else at work here.",Tenet

It felt like random scenes were cut & pasted into 1 movie.2 The dialogue was tricky to follow as everyone was mumbling.3 I didn't care for any of the characters, so I also didn't care about the outcome.

However it will take a few watches to let everything sink in, but it will be worth it. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece.A lot of complainers out there asking why do you have to watch on more than one occasion, and I bet these are the same people who watch their favourite movies time after time and pick up things after the third and fourth time of watching not seeing first time around.If you like 'The Matrix', 'Inception', 'Minority Report' and the Denzel Washington movie 'Deja Vu', then you will love this. If you hate time travel movies, then don't bother watching. Has a bit of 'Back to the Future' esk to it, when traveling through time to get plutonium.My only gripe, and other reviewers seem to be of the same concern, is that the dialogue from the conversations are somewhat muffled in various scenes.

Apart from one rapid early scene, there was almost no effort made to explain itself but I think that was a deliberate way to tell the audience not to dwell on it and just enjoy the ride. It was typically Nolan-stylish with several incredible set pieces which were brilliant to watch. The character motivations were not always convincing to me and I found the film lacking compared to films like interstellar and inception but it was certainty unique and ambitious when compared to the blockbuster field more generally. I also found, as with many Nolan films the dialogue was extremely low in the sound mix so, I found myself meddling constantly with the volume.

But this was awful.,1,25 September 2020,"In my opinion this is the worst of all of the bad Christopher Nolan story ideas all rolled into one big turd. Don't get me wrong, I like the first two Batman movies, Dunkirk, Momento and really like the Prestige. It's just the other 2 Christopher Nolan movies that I've seen that I just cannot stand. (Inception and Interstellar)The universe in Tenet is so divorced from reality that at a certain point it's easy to get bored and not care about the characters or the world that they're trying to save. And even if one does care, it doesn't make any sense anyway. I read the plot synopsis after it ended to be sure that I didn't miss some important story development that explained all of what appeared to be nonsense to me. Nope. I missed nothing. The synopsis described pretty much everything as I saw it. And it made no sense.And I've yet to read a review from someone who could explain what about this movie's story was good, bedsides it being original. And original can only do so much if what makes it original also makes it MAKE NO SENSE!!!Tenet legitimately makes much less sense than interstellar or inception. And I think both of them are annoying at times. But the skeleton is at least some recognizable resemblance of reality. Tenet never offers a very clear sense that it works within a regular world. No news story ever talks about people experiencing people doing things backwards. And how crazy it all is. There is none of that.And it's sad because this production wasted a lot of cool visual special effects, and some talented actors.Also, the sound mixing is AWFUL!!! Half of the time the music is too loud and obnoxious to hear the dialogue. Probably to cloak the audience realizing that none of anyone was saying could possibly make any sense.I wonder if the Nolan cult fans have a left side of their brain. Because it seems that all the story sophistry that makes his bad movies bad is what makes his bad movies good to his cult of supporters.If you're tempted to see this because I roasted it so much, please remember what I said about it being boring. It's really boring. Not just bad. Don't waste you time or money.It tries to be way too clever. But just comes-off stupid, inconsistent, and nonsensical to anyone with the slightest skepticism. It lures you into hoping that it will all make sense in the end. But if anything, the end offers even more questions than answers. Just stay away.",Tenet
400,Dello_,Visually stunning but not Nolan's best,8,27 August 2020,"""Tenet"" is a very good movie that I greatly enjoyed but it has some flaws. Starting off with the good stuff: ""Tenet"" is visually stunning, one of the best movies I've ever seen as far as visual choreography and it's pretty remarkable the fact that the majority of what's on the screen is practical and not CGI. Furthermore it has a great score, frenetic action and a masterful direction (I really hope Nolan can finally win an Oscar for best director). All this pros had left me really excited and I can't wait to see it again. Having said all of that ""Tenet"" has two major problems: the hardly comprehensible plot and at times a very bad editing. The plot is good and very interesting, don't get me wrong, and I'd say I pretty much have in mind what happened in the movie, but there's too many intricate things and the rhythm is fast and you will certainly lose some details. I have a genuine curiosity to see the movie at least other two times in order to comprehend clearly what happened. To give an example regarding Nolan's movies I found Inception more accessible at the first view. The second major problem is the editing that is criminal in some scenes: people talking that change positions after a cut, some cuts that interrupt important dialogues, missing links between scenes. But other than these two things, ""Tenet"" is a very good movie and we only can thank directors like Nolan that have the bravery not to choose a safe movie but try to experiment with this art in a blockbuster movie. So go watch it if you can and if you are safe!",Tenet

John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are PHENOMENAL in this film. Their dynamic duo and they both give their A-game for this. Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Aaron Taylor Johnson, and Fiona Douriff are also great and did a good job doing their parts. The cinematography is excellent. The music, however, I do agree, is too loud, and sometimes I can't understand what they are saying. For a second time with a friend, we both realize how good this film is, and the last act is the most fun you will ever get in this film. Is it the best Nolan film...... NO.

403,evan_harvey,"Loud, choppy, obscure and not as great as you want it to be",6,22 August 2020,"***** Potential SPOILERS *****Tenet follows the great Nolan tradition of really bad sound. It annoyingly loud and at times you can't hear what characters are saying. Nolan, fire your sound mixer. If you're mixing it yourself, fire yourself and get someone who knows what they're doing. Really s#!t work.It's also really badly edited (whether that's strictly editing or the script itself, who knows?). Some scenes happen with zero segue, and then at other points the movie gets bogged down. Unfortunately it's hard to care about the characters and story. Everything is a bit too rushed, and you don't have time to really soak it up and enjoy it.The time-bendiness is classic Nolan, but it's obscure and difficult to get a grasp on. Maybe the film will fare better with repeated viewings, but after a one-off watching it's potential tantalizingness is significantly diminished. Yes, there are some great things to ponder, but the core narrative of the story is buried so deep that it becomes a little ineffective. There is a reason for the time-bendiness, but it's obscured and to be honest I was a bit weary by the time it was all revealed.The basic plot of the film is okay, but I didn't really dig the ""inversion"" part. It's clunky and odd. Some great ideas and scenes, but overall it was difficult to follow clearly.Plus, the time-bendiness is never really explored in a way that lets you revel in it. Rather, it's hidden and revealed bit by bit which unfortunately means that you don't get to fully enjoy it.There's no theme here, at least in the way that other Nolan films have; Inception was about redemption, Interstellar was about the power of love or something, the Prestige was about revenge etc etc. This one doesn't really have that. Not a bad thing, though.The acting is okay, but Nolan never gives the audience time to settle in. The relationship between Washington and Debicki's characters seems to be important, but why? Who knows? Neither character is given time to answer that question sufficiently.This is really the main problem here. The pacing of the film is a bit all over the place, and it's hard to get involved with it. It jumps about from scene to scene at times with no explanation. I mean, I was able to follow it, but a few times I was asking ""What are they doing and why?"" and it took a while to understand (I'm not talking about the time-bendiness here either), which really diminished the film. In one scene, they're trying to get to a particular character. Why? You don't know till the scene is halfway finished. So instead you just sit there and watch them do some admittedly neat action scenes, but it's undermined because I have no idea what the goal is.Overall, it's okay. It spends too much time trying to hide it's big reveals for them to be effective, and it's too rushed/badly paced to get into. I hope that repeated viewings (on Netflix) will make it better.",Tenet

The performances are solid, but the plot is so fast moving there is no time for character development especially of the lead.

407,ansharora-12638,Nolan with a hint of Bay?,7,29 November 2020,"Okay, so not a perfect Nolan. But still, in my top 3 Nolans(yes like a painter). Tenet is a very complex movie which at times will feel like it's wrong or it has changed the scenes or the sense of it, but after studying those scenes, it will become clear that some of the scenes were correct and actually made sense.Some still felt a little wrong at point but I don't know maybe I didn't get them. We know it was classic Nolan- Mind bending Sci Fi with smooth action and shots of landscape. But, where it was not Nolan, I'm listing those points-1. It was weirdly loud and some words were lost in it. Though I watched with subtitles and it was easy then.2. The story arc was not great and was a little repetitive- Saving the world from ending.3. Dialogues were fairly weak- ""If I can't have you no one can"" or comedy ones like ""Where I'm from you buy a dinner first"".4. Acting was not a stront suit of the movie. Dimple Kapadia fell flat absolutely flat and I didn't think John Washington was ready for a titular role of this calibre yet.5. Absence of Hans Zimmer.I want to give this movie an 8.5, not a complete 9. I watched this movie only once in it's entirety, and then rewatched some of the scenes to grab the sense. Still, I think some scenes didn't make sense. For example why they went to Oslo when they could have switched back to the timeline in the same garage area because they already switched once when they brought the girl back. Idk.I won't be searching for answers on youtube or google though. I like the way I understood the movie. Ans yes, great cinematography by Hoyte, as always.If you liked my points, give a thumbs up. Cheers.",Tenet

409,riadmsh,"Inception 2.0, definitely, with a better, clearer storyline, logic and ending!",9,2 September 2020,"It was tough, intense, smart and, as usual, mind-bending. In my opinion, Mr. Nolan probably knew that he screwed up Inception at the end and he tried to fix it this time. The good news is he does it! With even better storytelling, logic, a more plausible ending and most importantly, without any loose ending.Tenet is tough to understand at times and I'm not sure whether I got it full or not. In fact, is it a scientific possibility or not I don't have any idea about it. And Christopher knows that too. He teased at the start: ''You don't understand it, right? Don't try to!''Matter-anti-matter, body-anti-body, version,-inversion, x-1/x, symmetry with the exact opposite, reciprocal, palindromic.... whichever term you use to define things, it's all in here. Christopher, once again, created the anti-universe in reply to the universe, where time is the only constant and you can't create any anti-time! I have seen movies with parallel reality, alternate reality or history, and, here, this one is about anti-reality. It also got elements from Back to the Future and Terminator at some points. And it leaves you with the feeling that you just watched another James Bond movie!Liked it, loved it and definitely want to re-see it!",Tenet
410,am-by,Very Average,5,10 January 2021,"The Sound was as bad as i anticipated not through the whole movie but most of it. Its like a sound engineer tried to sabotage the movie. A sound track plays loudly while there is dialogue. Try watching a movie on tv with a radio playing underneath the tv louder than tv volume and you will get an idea. That aside the movie isnt that great , the reverse action sequences feel like a gimmick after a while and almost ridiculous towards the end. Glad i didn't see it in the cinema as intended. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I found it boring.",Tenet

412,SimonD1900,Cool movie,6,2 April 2021,"Nolan's films looks amazing. And this might be the best looking one yet. The locations, the vehicles, the wardrobe. That's it's almost all shot in IMAX. And no cigi, just all real practical special effects. Makes this movie visually stunning, it's worth seeing just for that but the story and characters are very interesting too.John D Washington is great, what a guy, I hope he has a fantastic career. Elizabeth Debicki is really good too. The two had great chemistry also, I think, the movie missed out on not having a sex scene with the two, that would have been HOT. Also, I really liked the villian, what a good villian, just a human of pure malevolence, kind of like The Joker but very different style. Joker is better though off course.Movies like this cost a lot of money. But I think it's worth it. It gives you as a viewer an expirence you can't get from anywhere else. If you're not a billionaire and can travel to all these places and get all these gadgets yourself off course. But then, who can take part in cold war with the whole world at stake, were time traveling also is a major factor?Now, the story. It's cool. But I'm going to be honest, I didn't get it. I just hade a vague sense of what was going on. But I actually thought it was enough, like I was just taking in the expirence and didn't try to hurt my head. I wonder if that's might had been the reason why Nolan put in the heavy overbearing music, kind of like he was saying: don't worry so much of ""what and how,"" just go along with it, go with the flow of the movie instead overthink the technicalities.Over all, I really liked this movie. It's entertaining. It looks great. And the main character is slick as hell. The girl is stunning. The villian is terrifying. The side characters are interesting. It's entriging and complex but moves with a steady pace and constant flow. But, more then that, I ""sadley"" have to say, this movie doesn't really stand out to me so much. It's just a very nice looking futuristic spy flick.This was my second viewing of this movie and I liked it as much both times. I will watch it again sometime, definitely.

416,Caglatureray,Disappointing,4,15 December 2020,"I think I had extremely high expectations from this movie after Inception and Interstellar. I'm disappointed.Problems:
1- script is difficult to hear. First reason is the stupid sound mix, second reason is the vague pronunciations of the actors/actresses.2- no character is likeable. I mean it. There is no real story to any of them. Nolan tried to make it similar to interception characters, but failed miserably. None of them is interesting.3- conceptually, it's extreme fantasy- fiction (which is good) however it is too PUSHED. there is a saying: ""If u can't explain something simply, then u don't fully understand it."" I assume even Nolan in his own head, didn't fill in the blanks 100% about his own concept so he couldn't explain it simply.4- at the beginning of the movie, I said he was fighting himself, at the airport, one in and one out, timeline, inverted, I was right, I could see what was coming, it was not difficult to understand the movie and predict what would happen next. To me, it was easy and boring.4b- this proved to me that they really tried SUPER HARD to make the storyline work and make it look super smart or something. However it was honestly PUSHED!!5- the woman and protagonist. This relationship (whatever it is, love or pity or empathy) has lost me. Boring. What was in that relationship that made the woman so special to protagonist ?

The characters are unfortunately wooden and very shallow, lacking any form of normal human behavior/emotions which reminded me of an average James Bond movie where the bad guy is super bad, the hero is fearless behind a stone face, the partner is smart and reliable, the old man is wise and the woman is a victim. The time travel twist ruined it by being overly complicated to the point that I didn't care about the plot anymore. There are ""Tenet Explained"" videos on Youtube and after watching one I realized that not caring was definitely the right decision. I strongly recommend reviewers claiming they ""get it"" to watch one of these as the time travel BS is in fact way more complicated, which I seriously doubt they get.",Tenet

I am a fan of conventional film makers who believe in story telling with a straight and simple narrative . This movie was anything but this.30 minutes or so into the film there is a dialogue ""Don't try to understand this, try to feel it "". I took the hint and tried but it didn't work and I got more and more perplexed as the movie progressed. The mumbo jumbo of reverse timeline in the plot had me gobsmacked. The action however kept me awake.The action, editing,cinematography, sound, and special effects were superb but there should be a plot which binds them ,flows naturally and is interesting. For Indians however a pleasant attraction was Dimple Kapadia in an important role.Sorry Mr Christopher Nolan I just don't dig your type of film making.

In the cinema with the full effects this was one of the most enjoyable movies in a long time to concentrate and understand the complexity of this movie.The enjoyment of this movie doesnt end at the final titles, the theories and details that have been sprinkled throughout this film is what makes Nolan a master writer and director. Schrödinger's cat and the Sator Square help to understand the inversion of the movie to ensure that this keeps you on a level with the brilliant mind-bending situations that the protagonist finds himself in. the concentration level you have to keep in the first 30 minutes are be tough but the pay offs seem low key but so effective.The tag line of Bond on acid is one of the move actuate reviews i've seen. Cool slick fight scenes (once you've seen the movie the first time) as this will baffle some initially. The car chase from the trailer has a whole different dimension in the movie. All acting was perfectly cast, as all Nolan films are, Washington has stepped out of his fathers footsteps, Pattinson's first main stream film in a while shedding all perceptions of previous films, Debicki, perfectly innocent until the going gets tough, Branagh, a manic with the ability to let lose.Its been a long time since being able to see a new film in its natural habitat but a great one to kick start!",Tenet
425,JeanMoniette,1 minute explanation of the movie. It's really not that complicated.,9,31 July 2021,"Tenet isn't that complicated to explain if you stick to Sator timeline, which is the viewer's timeline.200 years in the future a team of evil people decides the grandfather paradox is BS after all (i guess they bet on the multiverse theory instead) and send back wealth and instructions in time for the villain, Sator, to find pieces of an artifact that will trigger a time-reversal once he kills himself thanks to a simple killswitch. Sator has a god complex and terminal cancer so he decides to follow the instructions of the evil future scientists.ONE part of the artifact is missing however, so he uses time traveling technology given to him by the future evil scientists to keep an eye on everyone he hires. Using this trick, he spots that a protagonist who just happen to have offered to get the last piece for him isn't here to help him at all, but to stop him from rebuilding the artifact and ending the world. In fact, even his wife Kat has been recruited by the protagonist to go on time travelling shenanigans alongside Neil, the protagonist's sidekick.But the protagonist is very clever, and double cross the villain by arranging for the artifact to appear to have been buried for the future scientist to use by organize a decoy op where the device is hidden. This leads the villian to decide to kill himself as planned, but nothing happens as the protagonist fooled him.**THAT'S IT**.That's pretty much the basic story. The only three 'twists' added to the move to make it more interesting are:a) time travel occurs in real time, just like in primer, so you age normally even as you go back. This allows for Neil to be maximiLIEN, Kat's son. Honestly there's no reason for him to be kat's son, it's just there just for fun.B) in one scene, the protagonist, not having realized that Neil had switched from 'moving backwards' to 'moving forward' in order to jump back in the battle, is heartbroken to notice that the person that has saved him by taken a bullet for him is no one else but Neil. Sad panda face for the audience.C) Future Kat has a change of heart at the last minute and kills her past villian husband, almost triggering the end of the world, but that is narrowly avoided by having neil doing the switcherroo mentioned above.The movie is a reflexion on freewill and obeys 'Primer"" time travelling laws, and therefore gets away with the grandfather paradox by simply not indicating how the protagonist gets involved in the project in the future, and also pointing out that even the scientist from the future prefer the multiverse theory.Another movie, 'predestination', actually closed that loop rather magnificently.It's a brilliant movie, but it's not the insane mind bender everyone depicts.",Tenet
426,TheAnimalMother,LMAO What A Joke! The DUMBEST action film EVER!!,3,9 October 2020,"Only Dunkirk was somewhat impressive out of Nolan's last many disasters, and even the story in that film was severely lacking to say the least. However at least it was an entertaining film, and I understood the story because I had already seen the old original film. This guy has completely lost his mind as a filmmaker. The kids still seem to love everything he touches ever since he made that constipated Batman trilogy. Bored nerds is the only way I can explain it. I'm going to go on record here and say that Sylvester Stallone's 1980's cheesefest action flick Cobra, was a far smarter film than this one. Seriously though, who the hell could ever even consider that this story would make for a good film? I'm at a loss. I'm giving this film a 3 out of 10 and honestly, that's pretty generous.

It took away from the movie. There was also a lot to take in when it came to temperal pinsar movements and the way inverted moved through the surroundings. Who was inverted and when? How they moved relative to everything and everyone else?I'd say this is Nolan's 3rd movie about Relativity especially regarding time along with Inception and Interstellar.

428,levybob,I'm not Stupid. Really I'm not.,1,30 September 2020,"I'm not stupid, really I'm not. College grad, career in computers. I have, in the past, watched and understood all of Director Nolan's other films (albeit in the case of 'Inception' this required a second and third viewings).
But this film, this 'Tenet', nope. Oh maybe bits and pieces but overall ... very little. We've all seen the film or TV episode dealing with time travel: If one could travel back in time and kill Adolph Hitler what a boon to mankind that would be. Well, Christopher Nolan takes this time travel scenario and explodes it into dozens of pieces, questions, possibilities. There's forward travel to the future, backward into the past, then the more distant past. And of course, there's always the present, the 'now'. But in this complex set of universes I just never fully understood what was going on, this made worse by the fact that much of the important early dialogue is spoken through face-masks which served to muffle the words. And as I did not know what was happening, I did not care, and as I did not care, I should have walked out. Which I did not. And so at film's end, when a voice-over makes certain statements meant to be profound and enlightening and yes, surprising, I felt ... nothing. Not a thing. And an hour later, I still do.Which raises the question, Will I watch it again? Sure.
And if I do, will I pay the admission? Oh, no.
So hey, HBO. Hey, SHOWTIME. STARZ ....
I am waiting.",Tenet
429,Benslie,Definitely recommend a second viewing,9,30 August 2020,"I feel like whenever somebody talks about a Christopher Nolan movie they have to mention the directing and how great it is and this movie is no exception. The directing in this movie was outstanding and I can't think of any other director who would be able to help bring this movie to life. From the epic action scenes that pretty much had zero CGI involved to the story that's mind-bending and requires a second viewing in order to fully understand what's happening and pick up on small details. There were so many shots in this movie that just had me going wow at how gorgeous they were and thinking how did they do that. I want to talk about the action scenes that sure might not be the most original but Christopher Nolan helped make them just that. While watching this I was just thinking about how they filmed so much of this with little CGI and from what I could hear not that many injuries. I wish I could watch the behind the scenes of the making for this movie because I really want to know how they filmed these scenes. There are so many movies about time travel out there but this story takes that and makes it original in a unique way. The story had me captivated from the opening scene to the very end but I will say there were times where it lost me. This movie is two and a half hours long and for the most part, you don't feel it but there are parts where I was like alright let's speed this up. This isn't helped by some awkward editing choices. For the most part, the editing in this movie is completely fine but there were some times where I was like why did we cut away just to cut right back to the same scene? It doesn't take anything away from the enjoyment of the movie at all but just me nitpicking. One thing I won't complain about though is the score in this movie, composed by Ludwig Goransson. The acting in this movie was great and you could tell that everybody was at least attempting to give it their all. For me, there was one real stand out and that was Kenneth Branagh, who plays Andrei Sator. Every time he was on screen you could just tell he was giving it his all and he made an intriguing villain. In the end, Tenet is a movie that for me at least needs to be viewed two times in order to fully grasp what's going on and it's best to keep your brain turned on while watching instead of turning it off.",Tenet

431,freddy_at_home,Nolan only did ONE mistake!!,7,30 August 2020,"After watching Interstellar six times, reading a lot of material on the matter, black holes and so on, I now feel like I got a pretty good knowledge in the quantum physics department. The most important thing I learned from all of it is that time/space can only be measured or controlled, if you will, by one constant thing... (Is it constant?! Some might argue) If you have not seen that movie yet, I will not reveal anything to ruin that experience for you.Now, the movie at hand. I had really high hopes for this movie. But I was left down leaving the cinema. At first everything was just forth and back, after that I started to understand it all and it got too predictable for me, and then I lost interest. It had some really good scenes, but somehow it all felt pretty cold and the dialog got boring, to the point that I wondered if I should take the rest of my soda back home with me or not, so I can recycle the bottle.It sad, because I really wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's previous work. I love sci-fi and time travel as well. This one left me thinking, something is missing. It has to be more than this. I'll tell you this much, Kenneth Branagh did an EXCEPTIONAL job. I loved his part. Bravo! He really is an artist.To be honest, following the logic of Nolan, he did one obvious mistake. He messed up the timeline for his own creations. Not all. But he presented Interstellar before Tenet, it should have been the other way around. But as all great artist' he can only have the imagination before and results after the fact. With that said, this is in no means a bad movie. It is just not that great. That might be my own fault, as I am projected into the art as a missile on the run from it's main target. It will never be easy topping your own great creations. It's a challenge few really experience, I believe. By the way, while I remember it, the soundtrack was not bad, but nothing like the ""meet God"" soundtrack he had implemented in Interstellar.I would have been more happy watching this at a PPV service at home. I don't believe the hype of this being THE cinema movie. We left the cinema, going ""neeh"" to each other. The biggest insult an artist can get, I know. But I suppose we all want the truth in the end.These kind of movies are hard to put on a scale 1-10. Mostly because if you think like this: The Shawshank Redemption is a 10, Interstellar is a 10. But The Fast & Furious (Not the first) but the rest is a 5 max a 6 maybe. So where do this go? I feel this should get better, but not max.

432,petera00,Nolan is getting better with age.,9,27 December 2020,Outside of the length and the over action... I liked this a lot more than Inception and his overrated trash interstellar... Very fast paced and dialogue but awesome structure... Dunkirk is Nolan's best and second will either be this or the prestige... He should do a giallo or film noir next... He would give movies like Chinatown a run for their money.,Tenet

Outrageous concept, incredible effects, thrills and suspense topped-off with high caliber performances and embraceable characters.I won't try to get into details because the film is cerebral and it takes time to wrap your mind around the concept. You will have 2.5 hours of amazing FX, thought provoking and mind-bending intrigue and an insatiable desire to watch it again-it IS that good!Kudos to the brilliant cast, Director, and writers. This film excels in a potentially new genre that inspires people to do things like; walk backward, re-think time, and pay closer attention to the way we treat our planet.",Tenet
434,darius_sutherland,Not a helpful review,1,15 December 2020,I USED to love Nolan and then I woke up or grew up. Tried to be philosophical but fails. I've come to realise he just cannot right decent dialogue. He's trying too hard to be clever. He should get somebody else to come up with the idea and someone else to right the dialogue and should just direct. That might be a better option.I just don't care 25 mins in because I'm know I'm not going to be what he wants me to be which is impressed with how his amazing mind works.....NOT,Tenet
435,mickdansforth,Fun Spy Action Movie,9,14 January 2021,"The definitive way to enjoy Tenet is at home (on a biggish TV) w/ the subtitles on, broken up into 2 parts, w/ at least a day in between. The 2nd half has more action/answers, so you will have a good time and forget how bored/confused you were in the 1st half.",Tenet
436,radhrh,OK but drags on a bit.,7,12 September 2020,"Tenet isn't a bad movie, but it's a very long way from being a great one.
It's your basic action adventure with a lot of busy work and going places to achieve goals so the Protagonist can get to the main bad guy ( a rare phoned in performance by Kenneth Branagh ). The time travel narrative feels a bit superfluous, something added so that forwards/backwards special effects could work but it isn't really explored in detail. The acting is just about OK with the exception of Robert Paterson who steals every scene he's in. The characters are 2 dimensional at best and it's difficult to invest in any of them which makes it hard to care what happens to them. Oh and it way over long, at least 30 minutes could be cut and the movie would be better for it.",Tenet
437,yellowmarlin,Falls short of the bar set by Inception,5,31 August 2020,"Nolan is undoubtedly one of the movie industries great talents, but he produces almost as many misses as he does hits. For every Inception there is an Interstellar. For every Memento there is a Prestige. Sadly, this is a miss. It promises much, and aims high, but falls short of the bar set by Inception. The problem is not in the concept, which is genius, but in the execution, which is clumsy. For long periods, this film is an incomprehensible shambles, the plot is incoherent and the effects are bewildering. Then it reverses direction and begins to explain the previously inexplicable but only some of them. It leaves glaring plot holes scattered liberally throughout the narrative and finishes with an unsatisfying pat on the back. Nolan overreached on this occasion.",Tenet

It's quite a dense movie and it's too easy to overlook critical items such as a backpack.That said, it's just not engaging; the characters don't have much development nor is there some kind of backstory. We're just shown random people doing stuff. I found myself wondering who those people are and why do I need to care.",Tenet
439,RJBrez,Nolan does it again,10,12 October 2020,"The only bad thing about this movie? That it had to be released in one of the worst years of our lives. This movie is so beautifully written and produced, and the execution of it all is really mind blowing. One of my favorite things about Nolan? He doesn't use CGI unless he absolutely has to. He loves the big set pieces and he is a genius at pulling them off. My next favorite thing about Nolan? He doesn't dumb down the script to satisfy a majority of people. He makes his art the way he wants to. I read this quote recently and I can't remember where but it basically said "" if you want dumb action, with no consequences or even a plot, go watch a Michael bay movie"". Perfect way to respond to some of the comments on here. It's simple, if you didn't get it, watch it again, maybe a few more times until you can appreciate it. If you still can't, stick to the simple movies. But don't get on here and bash this incredible movie. Nolan is a genius. The cast and crew did something remarkable here, and I wish it could have been appreciated by bigger audiences. Thanks China.To sum up, see this movie several times and you should absolutely love it, and more importantly, appreciate the work put into it.",Tenet
440,Criticalstaff,Truely Mindbending,7,30 August 2020,"If Chris Nolan was a musician this would be his best-of album. If you know who he is, what his style is, the themes he uses, this movie will feel familiar. Here, Nolan is re-using a lot of the same things from his previous movies. If you are not familiar with him then this movie will be a challenging puzzle to decipher. And, it will leave you with more questions than answers.On the surface, the movie is a succession of heist action set-pieces, inter-cut with character development which, for some reason, leans heavily on scenes of domestic abuse. The core of the movie is spectacle. It is a big show. It is fancy lights and impressive sounds. However, the movie is built, not unlike Inception, on a very intricate plot that is challenging to understand. At heart, neither the plot nor the story matters: the movie is an excuse to crash a real-life plane and have bullet impacts in reverse. Yet, the story his build like a Rubik's cube, where the mystery of what is going on is being revealed in a non-linear fashion.I left this movie satisfied and entertained. Technically it is a very good film. No complaints there. However, for all the perfection on the technical level the movie remains quite shallow. That is a criticism of Nolan in general as an artist. He is very competent as a director, but less so a writer. He knows how to tell a story very efficiently, and he is clever enough to construct these high-concept scenarios that challenge the sense of reality and fiction. Yet, this movie does not really have a point. The movie has no meaning. The film is exciting but it is rather dumb. The plot is intricate but who cares really? In other words, the movie has interesting mechanics but has no heart.It is something that I also noticed in Dunkirk. There was no reason really to care for the protagonist of that movie. There needed to be a stronger reason for him to survive: a girlfriend, a family... Similarly there is no prevalent reason for us to care about the protagonist of this movie except for the generic save the world motivation. He has no name, no identifiable attributes, he is barely a character. Halfway through the logical inconsistencies started to turn some scenes into involuntary comedy. All along the movie insists that the fate of the world is at stake, but it is nonchalantly swept aside to save some lady and her son. There is a scene where someone says: ""This will end the world"", the lady asks: ""What about my son?"" I am not happy to laugh at victims of domestic violence but this is what the movie brought out of me.
It is bothering how a movie that is so big in spectacle is so small in story. There are fantastic scenes of helicopters flying in formation and landing down in a war zone while others do the same in reverse. There is an impressive ""war ballet"" in the third act of the movie. Yet, the movie fails spectacularly when it's three people in a room having a conversation. That is the truly mind-bending thing: With a 200 million budget it fails with the scenes that costs nothing.At the end of the day, it feels as if Nolan is trying too hard to impress the audience. It is not because you have time travel that you have a good movie. It is the characters, the motivations and the tension. I was more impressed by Palm Springs, than I was by Tenet. It almost feels that the science fiction stuff was added to mask the emptiness of the story.SPOILERS: In the third act Nolan gives the keys to understand the plot. The ""whole thing"" was a temporal pincer movement. With the red and blue motif being present from the start. There, you don't need to watch it a second time.",Tenet

442,ThomDerd,"If you are into movies, Tenet is your jam.",9,28 September 2020,"If you want to enjoy an intriguing and interesting film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, then TENET is a great choice.My IMAX experience:
A bit of a headache at start but 20min later the headache gets bigger. About 1 hour in the film, it turns into a migraine. And about 1h 45m in, the head explodes!So... I had to go again and watch it.The 2nd time was very rewarding. No headache and i could see through many details and respect the effort making this film.Overall, this is an outstanding filmmaking effort by Nolan and Co. There is almost no green screen mambo-jumbo, real stunts are a fact and you can enjoy a plot which will keep you thinking what the hell is happening at 50% of the film. Rewatching is also fun; I had the pleasure to watch it in IMAX twice (it's all shot in IMAX cameras btw).Kudos to the score, it really coated the action and the entire film in a fantastic way, keeping pace at all times.I don't think I have seen something similar before in terms of non-linear filmmaking and although I was very confused at start, I got into it halfway through and that was very rewarding.Now I guess many of you are still confused.I was too.

443,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"Technically I Didn't See Tenet, I Am Forgetting It In Reverse.",6,17 September 2020,"Tenet, Christopher Nolan's latest, is a James Bond-style spy action film with a fresh sci-fi concept. From its teaser, Tenet played like a parody of Christopher Nolan clichés; the high concept with mind-bending visuals, large action set pieces, and a booming soundtrack. Admittedly, it was the first time it seemed like the cracks were showing and I distinctly felt like I've already seen the film.Christopher Nolan's brilliance is his firm grasp of what only cinema can do. He inherently understands that cinema isn't a story that is told or just seen, but something that has to be viscerally experienced. It's in that experience where he builds surprise in his stories.The most prominent example from my memory is how the Tumbler was introduced in Batman Begins. When the audience first sees the Tumbler, we are verbally told by Morgan Freeman that it is a bridging vehicle that can tow cables and make rampless jumps. That piece of information is understood and easy to picture, but has no visceral impact in that expositional moment which only acts as a setup. Later when you see the Tumbler ramming over cop cars and actively jumping through rooftops, your jaw drops.There are a lot of jaw-dropping cinematic set-pieces littered through Tenet designed with that mindset; an opening action sequence in an opera theater, a plane crashing into an airport that is done for real (move over, Face/off), a highway car chase, and more. The action sequences are technically impressive; for example, the actors and stuntmen trained to perform their fights backwards which is mind-blowing to see. Even amidst all the visual spectacle, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography conveys a realistic immediacy as if the events are unfolding before you.Where Tenet drops the ball is in how it conveys its exposition. Inception spends its first hour teaching the audience the rules of the dream world and uses visuals and cinematic language to reinforce the audience's understanding so they can take part in the more complicated schemes and gambits that Leonardo DiCaprio's team comes up with later in the film.Tenet is much more eager to get going and spends considerably less time teaching its science fiction concept to the audience along with very little reinforcement throughout. Much of the issue is all the exposition is given in dialogue and it's a chock full of made-up sci-fi terms and spy code words that craves some cutaway visuals to help explain what's being said. Add that with a roaring soundtrack (scored by Ludwig Goränson this time) that gobbles up the entire sound spectrum and what's left is a hazy elusive experience that leaves you cold.John David Washington has the presence of an old-fashioned action movie star, just a tough silent customer you don't want to contend with. Both his onscreen presence and physicality play very well to his role as The Protagonist (it's incomprehensible why Nolan couldn't have given his character a real name as if the movie wasn't complicated enough). I think Washington will become a movie star after Tenet, maybe in some actor-led action franchise on the horizon.Robert Pattinson was good as Washington's sidekick who seems to be having fun spouting the sci-fi dialogue with a playful facetiousness which reminded me of Tom Hardy's Eames in Inception. Kenneth Branagh plays his villain like a slightly campy Shakespearean version of Gary Oldman's Russian villain from Air Force One, the epitome of 90's action villains.Elizabeth Debicki has the job of being the film's emotional anchor and tries her best to pour life into an otherwise underwritten role as someone Washington's spy has to save. Added together with the labyrinthine plot and all the math that's required figuring out whether what you're seeing is forwards or backwards, it was difficult to emotionally connect to any of these characters and care about Elizabeth Debicki and her plight.The lack of an emotional connection to the characters also means there is no theme driving the story or a bigger question for the audience to ponder about and chew on. In Memento, it was revenge. In The Prestige, it was obsession. In Inception, it was guilt. Even though the theme seems like it's about time itself, Tenet is just an action film and it just does not hook me on the same level.Watching Tenet gave me a glimpse of what old age might feel like. The complicated dialogue hindered by its pounding soundtrack was inaudible. The story became increasingly harder to follow as if the plot structure suddenly decided to play a game of hide-and-seek with my brain. By the end, I was too slow and tired to follow what was happening and just wanted to go home and go to sleep.In the past, Christopher Nolan has shown great timing on the audience's brainpower and knew when to give exposition whenever our movie RAM was running low. Remember the scene in Inception where Ellen Page asks, ""Wait, whose dream are we going into again?"" That was so perfectly timed. In my theater, people burst out laughing because it was exactly what the entire audience was thinking. So there are really no excuses. Christopher Nolan knows Tenet is too much but supposes the audience will get it eventually on a rewatch. I feel half-cheated by this.People are talking about how this movie needs to be seen more than once. I heard it being murmured countless times in the men's room in the cinema after the film ended. The marketing campaign even seems to be selling that idea.Someone tried to talk me into joining a Ponzi scheme once when I was seventeen and I did not take the bait then. If an idea is the most resilient parasite, then I am Cillian Murphy's militarized subconscious projection with an automatic weapon holding the fort and still fighting the good fight. No, I do not buy into the idea of rewatching Tenet, at least not without a pause button.After the movie upon discussion, I could recite the plot, no problem. The clue is in the film's palindromic title, which is the equivalent of spelling ""race car"" forwards and backwards. What would only be clarified on rewatch is working out pure logistical issues, figuring who was when during which flip flop moment. With no emotional anchor or narrative clarity or theme, and even though I'm enjoying the water cooler discussions with friends and colleagues, Tenet is not fun enough to revisit. By default, this automatically puts Tenet at the bottom of Christopher Nolan's filmography.""Don't try to understand it. Feel it,"" says Clémence Poésy's scientist Barbara during the film's opening inversion training sequence. Well, Barbara, I tried. I really tried to feel Tenet, but in actuality, it seems it was more important to understand it. You lied to me, Barbara.",Tenet

Most of this movie is all practical with special tech we seen before but not computer generated which is mind-blowing to watch. The hard about watching this movie was the story and the rules it tells. Christopher Nolan is known to making complex movie with little understanding to it until it all makes sense. Tenet, on the other hand, is the type of movie you might need watch over again to understand everything. I left the movie with a bit of understanding, but mostly brain-dead. This isn't any chance a bad movie, but I would say this is the least favorable Nolan film he has made. The acting is good, the effects is crazy, the sound is...sometimes off (I watch this movie in subtitles so I can read what the characters are say), and the story is complicated. That is all.",Tenet
446,Waedliman,Pretentious waste of money and time,1,29 April 2021,"Tenet is Christopher Nolan's next example of plot emptiness concealed with surface stimuli. I know that many will rave about how innovative the film is, but they won't be able to explain the plot to anyone. As a result, we have a handful of actors who are more bad than good in leading us through a story that can be quickly forgotten. Kenneth Branagh plays the evil Russian, completely exaggerated once again, as has unfortunately often been the case lately. Elizabeth Debicki as his wife should take speech training. She mumbles and you have to be familiar with her accent or you won't understand her. Please apprentice with Michael Caine, he knows what he's doing. In many scenes of the film nothing happens. There are two people facing each other, narrating about the plot so we get something of what we then see. This is futile, however, because of the film's 2 hours 30 minutes of overloud music, so that the dialogue is often inaudible. Poor craft on many levels makes this film a prime example of pretentious waste of money.",Tenet

The idea is good, but almost impossible to understand while you are watching the movie (luckily we always have the ""Tenet explained videos"" on Youtube, ha, ha).

I don't want to hear about how it's a masterpiece and you need a second, third or fourth watch to get it. That is not the point of a film. No film should be required to be seen twice or more to understand what the F is going on by the end. I don't always mind open endings or films that make you think, but by the end of this film, you understand just as little as you did when you started it, and THAT is a scam in my book. At least with Inception, by the end you generally understood the plot and while it did have a rather open ending, IT STILL MADE SENSE. This movie is so confusing and entirely too long, not that I would've expected less than 2:30 hours anyway. I mean, it's Nolan. He loves to waste your time with exposition and unnecessary plot points. It's almost as if Nolan insists on making every new film as complicated as possible to ""one-up"" himself, but instead it just makes him look more and more pretentious. Even after reading up on the explanation after the film, I am STILL confused and I am annoyed I wasted nearly 3 hours on this travesty.

456,MovieWarfare,A mind boggling yet visually stunning and entertaining spectacle,8,26 August 2020,"It's weird to finally be watching a movie in the cinema after so long but Tenet was a film that I have been wanting to watch for ages! I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and watch nearly every single film that he has made. Even his less well-received movies such as ""Interstellar"" still wowed me in some capacity. Dunkirk, his previous movie, disappointed in some ways and not because it was bad, far from it, but because it was rather tamed and grounded compared to his crazy, mind-bending movies such as Inception. Tenet was him bringing back this craziness and return to the time concept again. The question though is if this film was worth returning to the cinema for? The premise is simple, a secret agent embarks on a dangerous, time-bending mission to prevent the start of World War III.Firstly, I got to praise the originality of this movie. Yes, it is a spy espionage movie and borrows a lot of element from the previous movies of the like. However, the use of ""Inversion"" really adds a layer on top of this movie and makes it feel like no other movie has. This ""inversion"" is best seen in the action sequences which result in some visually stunning spectacles. On that note, the action sequences are phenomenal from the car chase to the plane crash and my favourite being the fight scene between the protagonist and an inversion soldier. It's even more impressive when you realise that most of these action scenes are practical and not CGI which benefits the movie by not taking the audience out of it and keeping as glued to what's going on.Unfortunately, legendary composer Hans Zimmer does not return for Tenet and is instead replaced by Ludwig Göransson of Black Panther and Mandalorian fame. Despite that, Ludwig gives an impressive electronic score that elevates every scene and is deafening in a good way. If you didn't know Hans Zimmer was not scoring this movie and watched it, you still probably would think Hans Zimmer was still scoring it.The story is also intriguing enough to keep the audience engaged. It is simple with the agents having to prevent the ""Russian"" bad guy from dooming the world! However, the inclusion of inversion does add an extra element to the plot and makes the audience think about the movie. Even after it was finished, I was still thinking about the movie. The inversion adds an element of unpredictability to the movie and starts to change the way the movie operates. However, this inversion doesn't take focus until halfway through the movie. For the first hour, it is just a spy espionage movie with a lot of exposition and setup but the second half goes into high gear and is when it gets really good.The actors are for the most part give really good performances. Special mention to Elizabeth Debicki as ""Kat"" who gives a emotive performance of a woman who is practically in a domestically abusive relationship. John David Washington as ""The Protagonist"" (yes seriously...) has the suave and coolness from an agent spy, Robert Pattinson as ""Neil"" gives a lot of charm and wit to his performance and Kenneth Branagh as ""Andrei Sato"" is frightening in his performance as the villain.One major flaw about the movie, in my opinion, is the characterisation. You can already see this when the main character's name is never mentioned whatsoever in the movie. Apart from Kat (Elizabeth Debicki ) and Neill (Robert Pattinson), to a certain extent, are very bland and one dimensional. The protagonist (John David Washington) is the ""good guy"" and doesn't have anything else from that. We don't know his backstory, his feelings or even his real name for that matter. The character doesn't even have that big of a reaction to the inversion thing either and can feel rather robotic. Andrei Sato (Kenneth Branagh) suffers from a similar aspect to the protagonist is an over the top Russian bad guy and wants to end the world and wants to control his wife. There are some other supporting characters introduced in the movie and sadly they also are lacking in depth. The only emotive aspect in this movie is the abusive relationship between Kat and Andrei Sato. However, apart from that the movie very lacking in a lot of humanity and emotional moments.The second major flaw is the sound mixing in this movie. The voices of the actors are just so muffled or rather low sometimes which makes it hard to hear what they are saying. This gets even more difficult when the characters are wearing a mask or have incredibly strong accents like Kenneth's Russian accent. Occasionally, the loud music score is really loud during conversations between characters. This is quite detrimental to the movie as every dialogue is really important to understanding the movie and not being able to hear it because of weird sound mixing is not great.A minor flaw is the ""inversion"" explanation. It is still quite confusing to understand and while it is explained in the movie to a certain extent, it can still leave you rather confused and dumbfounded. It isn't a major problem as it gives a rough idea of the concept and in the end, this rough understanding is all that's needed to enjoy the movie. Just like a character says in the movie ""Don't try to understand it, Feel it"". Although, that is kind of a blatant reason for the director to not explain everything...Overall, the movie was a blast to watch. It is a bit weaker compared to Nolan's previous movies but is still stunning to watch. It is a grandly entertaining movie that is an absolute spectacle. I highly recommend considering watching it in a theatre as this movie is the best experienced there in all its glory.",Tenet

461,sujanfaster,Like a beautifully woven complex maze,9,13 December 2020,"Tenet, yet another Nolan's masterpiece had to hit the theatres at unfortunate times. I finally managed to catch a show after 3 months of its release when it was finally released in India.
Tenet's probably is the most complex Nolan movie yet with its main theme being around the flow of time. Some may like to call it a time-travel movie but it is much more than that.The movie like it's title gets going from the word go. It is hard to catch a breath and keep up with its storylines as you are into 30 minutes of the film. I'd be lying if I said I understood the whole movie in a single watch. I had to obviously read and watch videos around the concept. Although complex, the movie manages to keep the viewer well entertained and on their toes. The inverted action sequences messes with one's head but is something like you have never seen before. Just like most other Nolan movies, its the visuals and Ludwig Goransson's crisp composition are the ones which add to the wholesome experience.John David Washington effortlessly handles the 'protagonist's role. His subtle emotions at times are just about perfect for a film like this. Robert Pattinson seems as if he is in already in his Batman element with the shade that he adds to his role. The usual suspects of Nolan's case Michael Caine and Kenneth Branagh add to some good performances along with the prima donnas Dimple Kapadia and Elizabeth Debicki. The complexity of the movie leaves the viewer hardly any time to check out the acting performances :)Tenet is the most intense movie I have seen in 2020 after 1917 (pun intended). And it was definitely worth going back to the Cinemas after 9 months even though I had a little idea what was going on throughout the movie.",Tenet
462,Chrimle,Quarantined protagonist,7,22 September 2020,"Starts off with action, but little to no explanation. The characters are distant and completely flat. The main character remains unknown and makes it very difficult to sympathise with or simply understand his reasoning.The story's premise is intriguing, but not well executed nor explained. Furthermore, rubbing the audience's nose in it with dialogue like:
""-Do you understand it?""
""-Not at all.""
This is an unforgivable move, to expect the audience to simply accept that they will not understand it and not even attempt to explain it...The sound mixing is terrible, so much so, that vital information is missed - which is often via dialogue and not visual. There's very little visual story telling. The music is not spectacular, but fit the movie well.So, the dialogue is difficult to comprehend but is vital to understand the story, but the characters are extremely boring. Therefore, it is difficult to be interested in the story, but it does not end there... The goal for the main character is ambiguous and his relationship with other characters are confusing and unexplained. There is no sense of time whatsoever, except that the main character changes outfit in every other scene. There is no sense of urgency either and the drawn out final fire fight is baffling - since the conclusion is extremely hasty, dull and not at all emotional.",Tenet
463,catdogmanfish,Terrible,1,8 June 2021,"I'm not a Nolan fanboy, he makes some good movies, this is not one of them. There are some Nolan sycophants who will say you need to watch it multiple times to really get it, one guy legit said five times. I'm all about deep films with layers for the audience to discover, however, if a large portion of the audience is scratching their heads about what the film was then the filmmaker didn't do their job.",Tenet

But story is average.",Tenet
465,Schuriken,Boring & Confusing,1,21 September 2020,I started yawning after 10 minutes. At the 15 minutes mark my eyes started closing from boredom. After 15 minutes I just stopped watching the movie.Movies are made to entertain us. Not to confuse us and tire us with storylines so complex nobody wants to even sit and solve riddles and philosophical questions.I would rather watch Bambi on my old VHS player again. By now I don't even care who the director is or the actors for that matter.For me if you can't even beat Bambi on an old VHS tape then you have absolutely no right to be making any kind of movies whatever your name is.There is so much CGI in movies lately. Technically they are not live action films. They are cartoons. Therefore your competition is Bambi. Deal with it.,Tenet
466,GazWatson,"Thinks it's clever, isn't",5,27 August 2020,"This film is so far up its own arse. Yet again Nolan thinks he's being clever, yet again everything is telegraphed and obvious. It was that bad I fell asleep in the cinema at one point. The main guy is brilliant, the rest of the cast are pretty poor. The love interest was bizarre, and served no purpose than to make the mission more exciting. In reality he'd have let her die and finished the mission far sooner and easier.",Tenet

It's not just a movie, it IS cinema.
It's like one, long advertisement for the new techno-fad of temporal flipping. They go about it as casually as a young technology sales person explaining the latest smartphone to you. You only kind of understand what they're saying but what they're SHOWING you is so cool you just go along with it.
It is a good film to help understand TIME as potentially the next great expanse to be explored.
There's a scene in Avengers: Endgame where they belittle concepts of time presented in Back To The Future and almost every other time-related sci-fi movie. Well, TeneT makes Endgame's own concept of time travel seem rudimentary.

No idea what is going on as everytime someone tries to explain the plot, they're drowned out by background sounds & music especially with the cast whispering everything.
I've seen The Matrix 10 times & still don't understand it, but love it. This is just dreadful. Kenneth Branaugh is the only thing any good about it",Tenet
469,Naoufel_B,Not Nolan's best but still holds his unique directorial style,7,8 December 2020,"Switching between gorgeous visuals and bad audio mixing, this is definitely not Nolan's finest film, but you could handle it if you are familiar with his previous works. Due to its unique nonlinear structures and convoluted narrative you need more rewatches in order to enjoy it.",Tenet
470,suprabhattacharya,Tenet has cons in it's every pros,8,9 December 2020,"The first film to open in theatres worldwide in 2020 in the pandemic period clearly reflects the position of Nolan in world cinema, tauted to be Nolan's most ambitious project the anticipations were high. Where other big boys of world cinema surrendered to the streaming platforms for releasing their films, Nolan managed to get a theatrical release.
Tenet is a huge film , and also a comeback for Nolan to his favourite genre Sci-Fi. The film clearly shows the amount of effort and dedication the entire cast and crew have given to make this film. Hans Zimmer's absence was a disappointment as a composer but Ludwig Goransson has not only filled that void but also shown brilliance in not imitating Zimmer but creating his own enigma which has elevated the experiece of watching the film. The film technically is brilliant but as I said the cons are in the pros,the editing is abrupt which restricts the audience to involve with the characters. The characters are not to root for but just to merely follow except Elizabeth Debicki's character
who has the only emotional arc in the film. There is a line in the film ""Don't try to understand it, feel it"" but the film is the complete opposite of it ,you would to have to re watch it couple of times to understand it and after you have,the film looks great but you will feel like solving a complex equation only nothing more. The impact of the film is short-lived because the characters are distant so one will not feel their urge to do whatever they are doing in the film .The film has also the weakest ending in a Nolan film just like Dark Knight Rises which also suffers from a bad third act. Like Inception ,the film involves several cities but unlike the former the flavour of cities or even the transitions between them are hardly noticeable. The absence of a proper back story, a clear objective made this film a mere andrenaline sci-fi spectacle,you will enjoy it while you are watching but after a few hours or days it will be a distant memory.
The concept of time inversion involving thermodynamics is properly used in the film, the minute details in that department is genuinely appreciable, the action sequences are well choreographed and executed. Hoyetma Van Hoyetma has done a great job as a cinematographer. James Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki gave the strongest performances in the film.The opening sequence of the film will really vibe you for an immersive experience and particularly reminds me of the scene when Bane raids a rugby match in The Dark Knight rises. The film is clearly not one of the best of Nolan but still very expertly made and executed.",Tenet
471,Mike_O_Dwyer,Nolan Jumps The Shark,3,1 December 2020,"It had to happen, Nolan's finally made a duff movie.Not because of the dodgy sound-mix, something Nolan doesn't give a damn about getting right so suck it up.Nor the Camembert laden dialogue.Nor the trippy concept of time, which isn't anywhere as interesting as it thinks it and is downright clunky in how it is used as a premise compared to how time is so elegantly and satisfyingly used in Arrival or Interstellar.The problem with Tenet is that it looks like a bunch of set piece concepts held together by a protagonist so utterly devoid of screen presence that he doesn't even warrant a name. He even calls himself the protagonist of the operation at one point which...I mean, come on, that's as laughable as Clint Eastwood saying 'I'm the man with no name"" in The Good The Bad and The Ugly. John David Washington just doesn't work in this role, there's absolutely no conviction there for the part - although he's not served well by pancake flat supposedly snappy bite-back dialogue - other than looking that damned good in a suit.The villain's plot involves the old grandfather paradox (if you go back in time to kill your grandfather how do you get born to kill your grandfather), which Nolan came across in the bargain bin of Plots R Us. Apparently, the result would be apocalyptic, which will be news to writers in the 1930s (and every decade since then) when they find out they were wrong. The villain is basically a spoilt brat billionaire who wants to throw everyone's toys out of the pram because he can't have his. Like Trump, he's the kind of crap villain you just want to slap and make stand on the bold step until he sorts himself out.You would think a big old airplane ploughing into a hypersecure building would be exciting, but it kind of trundles along before gently rolling into something that looks like it was built from tinfoil and papier-mâché before inexplicably blowing up stuff because explosions.It all looks pretty, but awfully vacant.",Tenet
472,alanpuzey,A much enjoyed second viewing,8,4 January 2021,"I'm a Nolan fan. I knew I would have to watch Tenet (and all his films) at least twice to enjoy them more. I don't mind watching any good movie more than once.I watched Tenet in the cinema during the summer of 2020 and gave it 8, mainly on anticipation of seeing it again. Round to January 2021 and I've just watched it again - via video on big home screen, which enabled me to stop and rewind a few times, plus I had subtitles. All this helped understand the film much better and I enjoyed it a lot, still giving it an 8 rating.Not outstanding, but a well-made film with interesting story, in the Nolan tradition. Many critics slam 'the science', but hey, it's a film!",Tenet
473,jakerocks,A noisy mess,1,29 March 2021,"This is science-fantasy, not science-fiction. So Nolan can twist the rules any way he wants. It's a silly film with just enough story to tie the reality bending visuals together. As usual Nolan goes for a masculinity affirming amount of violence and torture tropes.Torture is employed here just to increase the tension in meaningless films like this. Persistent threats of violence against women is an action movie trope that needs to be retired. It's outdated. Using it as a recurring theme only reestablishes it as authentic in the minds of young male viewers.We finally see the important hand gesture but it's of no consequence. Or is it? I don't care enough to figure out Nolan's latest puzzle to watch it again.The sound is so loud but you can't hear the dialogue, especially at key points. Not telling you what's going on doesn't make it sophisticated. The entire movie is a lot of macho nonsense.",Tenet

Its not even that it's pretentious (which it is), or bad acting (which is had) or a storyline that you dug your heels in and waited for the payoff (which never arrives), its just a bloated waste of time with the sploudies and a script unraveling in real time (not the future), or maybe it was...I don't even care, the credits couldn't roll fast enough.Hard pass.",Tenet

To me it's overall plot is not beyond comprehension and I personally quiet get it: it's basically a James Bond-esque movie where the hero try to save the world from some maniac, minus the cool gadgets and the make out scenes, with a special touch of Nolan's version of how time travel supposed to be in order to make sense: Reverse Entropy.I don't quiet get why some people disappointed with this, even calling it the worst Nolan movie, but I enjoyed it. Kinda felt sleepy when I watched it tho (since I watched it from my smartphone and my eyes got a little bit tired from watching two movies from the same gadget before) but I think I will enjoy it more had I seen it on the theater.

The conversation between the characters feels really forced. I know some of the line are hard to deliver, but it seems like the actor didn't even try. Not to mention there are numerous corny lines. OH MY GOD. The fact that it was written by Christopher Nolan, The Master himself is mind boggling.Tenet is basically a failed spy/action film with splash of sci-fi. The fighting scene is like done by an amateur and looks extremely awkward. At some point, during the fight scene, it looks like a guy having a seizure on the ground.The only good thing i can say about Tenet is probably the visual.

490,mvahidalizadeh,Another great movie from Christopher Nolan,8,3 September 2020,"This is the story of a soldier who gets involved in saving the world from a disaster worse than the world war 3. In the movie, both sides of the story have access to a machine that changes the entropy of the objects. When a person walks out of the machine the time and objects are backward for him (the cars are driving backward and people are walking backward). The story is incredible. I watched a lot of movies about time travel, but this one is unique and novice. John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh were awesome. The sound effects, background music, and special effects were incredible.
The action scenes are great. I have never watched action scenes with objects moving backward. The movie is well-directed. I can see the evolution of Christopher Nolan as a director by looking at his movies Memento 2000, Batman Begins 2005, The Dark Knight 2008, Inception 2010, Interstellar 2014, and Tenet 2020. He is one of the incredible directors of our era.

495,ablack90,Disappointed and Loved all Other Nolan Films,7,30 August 2020,"I'll watch anything Nolan writes and directs but Tenet is nowhere near the beautiful storytelling of Inception or Interstellar. I felt no emotion other than impatience watching Tenet. It's a cold film with spartan set design and little time for character. It's all action or expository dialogue. While I felt disappointed, I also appreciate the world building Nolan did in Tenet. I'm a sci-fi afficiondo but I felt cheated I didn't get enough of Tenet technology.Some pros and cons ...
Pros: Pattinson is always cool and has charisma and Debicki is like a new Vanessa Redgrave - she has presence. I like her as a strong woman as in The Man From Uncle vs a femme fatale. I felt somewhat connected to these two characters in Tenet.Cons: soundtrack was WAY too loud as to render dialogue inaudible. What good is that if you make film and people can't hear the dialogue? I actually felt ripped off. My son had to insert ear plugs. I'm not sure what experience Nolan is trying to induce with this type of sound mixing..?Not enuf Sci-fi technology: The audience learns things along with the Protagonist played by John Washington. Tenet organization recruits him from the CIA to get close to a Russian oligarch, Sator to stop him using Tenet technology to end the world. He recruits Pattinson's character Neils to assist and then befriends Sator's estranged wife. She sold a forged painting to Sator who is using that to control her contact with their son. Our Protagonist & Neils steals the painting from storage to free her from Sator's grip.As the story progresses, we learn pairs of turnstiles enable people and objects to entropy themselves in time travel, either to invert (go backward) through a previous time, thus necessitating a gas mask or, to enter another turnstile to be able to move forwards in a previous time. The film spends very little time explaining this technology. There's a scene about inverted bullets (which are sent from the future & sold on the black market). There's hints in a few scenes that people and objects are moving backwards. But we don't see the actual turnstiles well until an hour into the film. And even then it's through quick action sequences so you're like oh but! oh but! Eh it's past.Plot: The film ends with a glorious action sequence where military from the Tenet org assist our Protag & Neils in stealing 9 pieces that form an algorithm from Sator, who plans to end the world because he has cancer. Apparently the future is bleak due to climate change and they communicate with Sator he should end the world. Does this strike anyone other than me as a seriously flawed plot line? We have a virtually invisible antagonist character in the future using a Russian oligarch to end the world. I'm shocked Nolan went that way.",Tenet
496,blackoutH,Nolan cannot disappoint,9,4 January 2021,"The greatest director alive (possibly of all time) graces us with his latest installment in a rough year for cinema.I can't deny it, personally there isn't a single Nolan that I didn't love, some of course more than others, but a lot of them are in my top 5 movies of all time. This guy manages to do something that I cannot see other directors make, he makes a movie for the masses but at the same time they are far from what you would refer to as a ""commercial movie"" in the sense that, you get a complex, original, well crafted and amazing story probably not for every viewer's taste, but at the same time you make a huge box office success.
Of course the love for Nolan still sits today in one of the best movies of all time and the best super hero movie adaption in cinema history, the Dark Knight, but he is way more than the Dark Knight trilogy director, he is a brain picker and goes to extreme lengths to make sure you have pure art given to you.Getting into the movie, Tenet is an unconventional spy story, with a lot of the elements you see in other action flicks but the approach that it takes is completely different from what you've seen before, it's hard to describe it without giving in much spoilers, in summary you follow the protagonist as he unveils a major conspiracy that will make you question the natural laws of the world.
So being an original movie is the begging, then you are graced with out of this world practical effects and you can't help but smile while you realize that what you are seeing has no CGI whatsoever.. You know the feeling, even in a good movie where you clearly see the CGI there, and you let it go but still bugs you a bit? Not with Nolan, not even when deciding to crash a plane into a building!
Adding to the practical effects, we have of course your typical choice of amazing actors, and I have to say although John Washington was incredible specially considering most of the insane stunts were performed by him, I keep getting surprised by Robert Pattinson who beautifully delivered in this movie.
Stunning (real) locations are also what makes this movie so engaging, and that makes it even more organic, I have no lack of good things to say about this as you can clearly see.
Now, there are also of course some small critics I have to make, since usually 10/10 is the mark I go for in Nolan's films, this one I didn't do it simply because I didn't feel the rush that I felt on movies like Interstellar or Inception or even the Dark Knight trilogy, and I guess the main reason for it (small spoilers ahead) is because a plot revolving around time travelling as some expected outcomes that take a little bit of the fun out of the story.
Even with the original take on this topic, it's a mind twister but not at the level of previous Sci-Fi made by Nolan. Aside from that, it's just another unmissable movie coming from the master himself - the low rate people are giving simply because it's confusing is ridiculous, if you didn't get it at first watch it again, the clues are there",Tenet
497,jackbanister16,Huh?,6,14 January 2021,"After reading through some of the reviews, I'm glad that I'm not alone on this. I was confused, disoriented, and at times overstimulated.I was able to pick up the general gist of the conflict, including how time travel/inversion worked and what Andrei was trying to do with it, but I felt like trying to follow the visuals of inversion and the ever changing nuances of the plot at the same time was highly disorienting and unenjoyable.Furthermore, I am a guy who loves rumbling and loud sounds in movies (when it fits the scene), but this movie pushed my limits. I may be exaggerating, but it felt like there was a loud synthesizer blasting every other couple of minutes. Nearly every inverted fight scene featured loud synth blasting and it became fatiguing.The movie, is undeniably nice to look at and visuals were on par with some of Nolan's best work, but story wise it felt like one of Nolan's weaker pieces. I enjoyed the performances of all of the main characters, including John David Washington, who I have never seen in a film before.I did not enjoy Interstellar or Inception the first time I saw either of them, but I really came to enjoy them with subsequent viewings. Maybe that will happen with Tenet? Nolan has earned enough credit for me to give it another shot.",Tenet
498,curzon_dax,The script is dumb.,6,6 December 2020,"Most people will feel dumb that this movie confuses them: but the reality is that the movie itself is dumb: in the sense that by design it frustrates the user with a premise that is not inherently hard to understand but it is extremely hard to enjoy. In my experience I had little difficulty understanding the mechanics of the story - mainly because I'm a die hard science fiction fan and a literal scientist - but I felt that while the story was mildly original the core of it was mostly an exercise in mental gymnastics for a concept that didn't progress much and it could have been only one small part of the story and not the entire thing because at the end of it I felt like I watched an entire 3 hour long thing that was mainly a ""look at me: I think I brought up a confusing concept"" (which wasn't that much really) so this story should have concentrated more on making an interesting story rather than a self-congratulating repetition of a concept that was clearly explain with exposition on the first few minutes (also the Direction was mostly soul-less since it felt like mostly created by committee).",Tenet
499,Crystal_Dive,It is actually EASY to follow,2,4 September 2020,"Just think of it as an adaptation of a 'classic-comic book' . The silly and funky type of comic book.You're not meant to understand the concepts presented in this film , because the in-universe explanations don't make any sense in of themselves. Explanations are 'just as it is'. It is deliberate that it is not explored with different perspectives in the film nor is there an attempt to actually explain things in a clearer manner , cause Nolan could not explain it other than on face value, to himself either.Perhaps the sound mixing was done this way too to muddle whatever explanations that was attempted in the film. And to pass off any confusion in the film's concept as being too intellectual for the viewer to comprehend.Zany time travel ideas which makes zero sense, but looks cool? Supervillian and superhero motivations? Shallow characters and conveniences? This is pretty much the whole shtick of the film. Expect nothing more.
-----A good time travel movie (or novel) is a movie which does not make the whole time travel the center piece of the movie. (cause any time travel is inherently an impossibility, and the said story will fall apart if that is the sole focus) The good ones make the stories about the characters and their motivations.The bad ones just use time travel as a SFX showcase.",Tenet

This movie had the continuity of throwing a puzzle down a garbage disposal, running it for 5 minutes (with the water on), then TRYING to make that puzzle into ANYTHING that makes sense!I wondered about the movie editing and whether it was even pointless to attempt to edit it into something that anyone could follow!Shots were pretty... and effects were good. Audio was very good and production values high. But acting wasn't great.. and story was a fricken mess!I saw this with my 19 year old daughter (who is into parallel timeline stories and such) and even she said it made NO SENSE!I LOVE sci-fi and adventures.. and this had both.

Visuals and effects are stunning. Set pieces and camera work stunning. Plot - was there one? Nolan kept it well hidden, perhaps all will be revealed in the sequel. Huh.Didn't care about any of the characters, not one remotely interesting or who you became vested in. If this was anyone else than Nolan and people said you have to watch it 3-4 times to understand it then I'd say, fair enough. But it seems that since the Dark Night Rises, Nolan has decided that being clever is preferable to being entertaining. Interstellar did for the wonder of the universe what Clive Dunn ('Grandad') did for the joy of music. Interstellar was just a maths puzzle. Dunkirk was like a dispassionate documentary with the focus on Harry Styles who played another of Nolan's ciphers. Only Tom Hardy's cameo at the end had any heart. The rest of the film is just so detached.Nolan hit a home run with Inception. It was another mind-bender but it had heart. You felt for the characters and their fate came to matter to you. Nothing he's done since has the warmth of Inception. In a hundred years the posters for Tenet and Interstellar will be on the walls of every Android fanboy.

Watched 2 hours and 9 minutes and gave up right when the ""action"" started (decided to read a few spoilers instead - which I should have done instead of watching this film). The only thing this movie had going for it was some kind of time traveling tech but the implementation was beyond sloppy and the visuals (backward scenes) nonsensical.So you have ""basic action plot 101"" (rich evil villain vs government operatives), a few juvenile secret handshakes (ie, the use of secret phrases), enough blurry accented english to give it an international flavor (and frustrate you further) and finally... a (failed) gimmick (maybe the worst I've ever seen) to hide the fact that this was just a bad script.If this was a 10-minute web episode, I'd give this a 4 rating for effort (and for spending 200 million on a 10-minute web episode).As it stands, a 2 rating is fairly generous (and it's for the performance of John David Washington as the Protagonist - I thought he was the film's only saving grace).",Tenet

I dont think it would have been half as boring if the lead had an ounce of acting talent. Seriously, John David Washington CANNOT act to save his life bruh.

""Tenet"" just felt like a forced Nolan product. The premise is cool and as expected for any Christopher Nolan product, mindbending, but only on the surface. The cinematography and effects are stellar but these elements are profusely overshadowed by its convoluted plot and stale monotonous dialogue. The soundtrack drove me crazy because I was aware the great Hans Zimmer wasn't available but my ears couldn't handle this obscurely forced and lazy Zimmer knockoff sound environment. For me, this is a bottom tier Nolan film and maybe the worst creation of the illustrious filmmaker. I was also quite underwhelmed with the performance of John David Washington.

The difference between Tenet and ""Memento"" (2000) is that in ""Memento"", Nolan just reverse the different parts of the movie from the last part to the first but in Tenet we see the reversal in itself!!
The most important difference between ""Inception"" and Tenet is that in Inception we can enjoy the action parts and understand movie at the last minutes of the movie despite the complicated story that it have... but Tenet just confuse audience and they can't enjoy the action parts of the movie because they can't understand what was happend exactly!!

The whole film plays out with these kind of tropes and paper thin characters we've seen hundreds of times in other films. Perhaps this would be okay if it did something new with them... but it doesn't.Its well shot on clearly a very large budget, has a fine cast who are all doing their best but the dialogue is dull and the 'plot' nothing new. As a concept you can see why this might make a good film but it gets tied down in too many big set pieces and the finale with lots of soldiers running around while things explode just feels completely dull and uninvolved.Clearly a talented director but perhaps less so a writerr, much like Quentin Tarantino, the more self indulgent his films become the less enjoyable to watch they are.

I loved Nolan's other loud and complex movies, but there is a BIG difference between being willfully confusing and obscure, as opposed to being clever and thought provoking (as in Inception). The plot would have gotten a 10 if it had been well executed.Now let's talk about the sound. The music was fitting, but the music and sound effects were so loud they obscured the dialog. We HAD TO use subtitles for God's sake! Sound gets a 2 out of 10.The acting was great, especially as to Pattinson, Debecki, and Branagh. I'd give their acting 10's. But Pattinson and Debecki and Washington talked low and as if they had marbles in their mouths. I assume they were told to talk like that, because I've never noticed that tendency in them before.Overall, very disappointing. I've watched Inception multiple times, not to figure it out, but because it is enjoyable. We'll never watch Tenet again.",Tenet
515,andrewburgereviews,"Time travel... no, wait, literally!",7,1 October 2020,"I often wonder when I think of Christopher Nolan and his high-concept ideas why is he doing this to himself? The plots of movies like ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" were hard to follow for the viewer--albeit, after wrapping your head around them, they were genius--but just imagine how difficult it must've been to write them. And this one is the most complex of them all.If this is enough to convince you to watch Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" then you might as well stop reading at this point. From a Nolan-esque point-of-view, you will be satisfied--as will be all the internet film theorists who are just scrambling to untangle everything there is. For them, this is the most satisfying work perhaps since ""Mulholland Dr."" but for me, I can't be bothered. For all its complexity, the most amazing thing that Nolan did here was making his concept comprehensible enough for people to follow the plot--that is fine enough for me even if I often find myself retracing each character's steps, trying to tie everything together. But when I happen to grasp the realization of his ideas, is like my mind can't handle it--trying to fully unwrap this movie is tiring, hard work, and it's not even the point anyway.The title of this review might also seem like a blur to you if you hadn't seen ""Tenet"" but once you see it, you'll get it. One of the reason Nolan's concepts are so intelligent, creative and interesting is because they are often based on scientific taboos. He knows that, and he is not afraid to show off. This is one of the most opulent, disgustingly luxurious movies I've ever seen. Some of these set-pieces, the stunts, the amount of polished metal that gets blown away feels like it would cost more than most studios would agree on. But this is Christopher Nolan. He doesn't want it any other way. Denying 3D and computers as much as he can, I bet it wasn't hard to convince Warner Bros. to throw him a 200 million dollar check--although I am sure this wouldn't have happened looking at the state of the world now.So, I am glad this movie managed to get done. And as much as I am appalled by the elitist suits and designer brands, I also kinda like the cheekiness. But Nolan did not do this because he could. What bothers me about all this luxury is the reason why I think is there--is not because of a show of attitude, but because of Nolan's compulsive need to be taken seriously. This is a director whose constant brooding sometimes gets the better of him. It rarely happens, but here it did the most. I was even wondering if a scene containing gold bars falling from a plane had actual gold bars. They weren't real, were they? They were? No, they couldn't have been.This presentation extends to the characters, which are often charming. I won't get into the plot but just know that it's a big deal: espionage, billionaires, World War III, The Apocalypse--all the good stuff thrown into the blender to create the sweetest orange juice possible, almost to the point where it's childish. But if the lead, known only as The Protagonist, is played fluidly by a flamboyant John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh's Russian oligarch Sator could pass as a bond-villain undetected--Russian accent included--then it's a shame that Elizabeth Debicki's Kat comes out as a loser way too many times--there was even a scene containing domestic violence. It was odd, out-of-place and unnecessary, especially coming from a Christopher Nolan movie, and it left a really bad taste in my mouth.Overall, the script is efficient. There is barely any chit-chat, every line serving to forward the plot. It has to! Nolan's script is complex enough, and while the dialogue serves its purpose of trying to help us make sense of what's going on in front of our naive eyes, then its lack of human connection, albeit inevitable, only serves to thicken the screen separating us from the characters. Everything is about Nolan's formula. It's amazing how it sustains this movie, but then again it took him over five years to write it into a script.",Tenet

I saw it in a newly remodeled theater so I am only docking a star as it may have been the theater sound and not the movie. The foreign accents were very thick and hard to understand, including that characters all wore masks from time to time. If you hated Bane's mask in the DKR, than Chris has a whole new level of that irritation for you. Then the soundtrack was constantly playing throughout the movie. Sometimes they highlighted the track over the dialogue, and it wasn't so distracting as just another problem with hearing the dialogue. AND I think I needed to hear the dialogue, because I was lost so much of the time, in a good way, but I definitely missed the explanations for some of the things that were going on. It was wild and complex, and I'll need to see it another 5 x before I completely understand it. But the characters and the cinematography and editing, really did make you want to understand it.

I think a 60's Bond film has action sequences more believable than this film. So much of this comes from millennium film making; too cautious to offend any demography, age etc. The violence scenes have become outright laughable. I am not trying to condone violence., But in that case do not make a movie that requires a lot of it. These 'tough' Russian mob enforcers are politely tapped on the nose, or it is implied that something vague just happened around the throat area, and voila you have 2 unconscious bodies. Which are then safely deposited in comfortable air mattress. The scene of them ""sailing' was so plainly edited w/ green screen, and stock sailing footage. The big airplane fire; the Indian pilot was stepping idly off a ladder; while this supposed machine of infernal doom was careening into the vault. I understand the longevity now of standards like 'Die Hard' or Tom Cruise flics. the reason these movies are exciting because you are sitting on the edge of your seat. I easily was able to hold my breath as long as they did in the vault. It made me think of a scene in 'Lost' when a character drowns, and it is excruciating

A grandiose cinematic achievement unlikely to be matched anytime soon. It took balls to pull this off and not get lost in the process. Kudos to the editor and the cinematographer as well. Nobody would dare to try this in the past and probably won't in the future. It's bold and unique. Multiple views required to fully grasp the concept. However I don't expect the general public to love it as much as Inception or Interstellar because in those cases he leads the audience and explains quite a lot. Tenet's script relies upon the intelligence of the audience and Nolan doesn't help you along the way. It's a must watch, ideally in IMAX if possible. A movie in which you can see his love for cinema in almost every scene. The pace is fast and 150 mins fly. Music and sound in general is amazing.Tenet will stick with you long after you have left the theatre. You will have a myriad of questions unaswered and to some of them you will find answers after multiple viewings.

I agree it's not the best to watch in the cinema though. But some people take it a step further, and basically hold that since they didn't understand it, the movie sucks, which seems a bit unfair imo. It may be confusing, but it's not that it doesn't make sense. Anyway, as long as you can keep up (I recommend doing what I did, and pause when needed), the movie is great. Very interesting plot, good acting, and good action. There's not too much exposition either, don't know why some people say that. But I agree with everyone else, the poor sound mixing in this one is a big issue. Whoever was in charge of that did a poor job, and it's the biggest problem in the movie, one which is made worse by the fact that this is a movie where you need to hear what people are saying. You basically get SUPER loud music, but super low volume voices, it's really weird. So DEFINITELY use subtitles when watching this (I always do anyway, since English isn't my first language).

Michael Caine had one scene and he had to talk with food in his mouth for the entire scene. It was a deliberate directors choice to garble all words.Not just in that scene, but in all of them. When they were having a conversation, they had removed all the structure words (the, and, a) and just had a ""baby talk"" conversation using long scientific terms that they didn't understand themselves.If a conversation ever started to make sense, he would cover it with loud music and aeroplane noises. So loud, I literally had to cover my ears it was hurting.The mix was dreadful. One moment it was super loud, then the very next they were mumbling in whispers. I never experienced such a bad sound mix as this.As for the plot? Again, it makes no sense. Gunshot wounds don't ""heal"" in reverse time.

Nolan's obsession for tech details made the Inversion the main character shadowing the human characters, which are shallow, irrelevant and non-memorable some apparently important, like Target who does nothing remarkable.
Then to observe the recipe for classic cinematographic conflict Nolan sorts it out bluntly by naming the protagonist, well the Protagonist, but then never revealing the real Antagonist, the people from future? I know, Sator was the bad guy, but the reason for inversion tech was a failing future planet, and that story is missing.

They're not connected to anything, LOL.Storyline is convoluted as hell. Oh, so I'm supposed to watch this twice to ""get"" it? Hell no, that's BS.Even the convention of inversion (and inversion ordinance) or backwards action(s) isn't even realistic. It's like some stupid idea that a fifth-grader came up with, that makes no sense and has no possible ""realism"" in science fiction.75% of the dialogue is unintelligible. Accident? Intentional? I don't know and I don't care. That's BS. Bad, horrible filmmaking. WTF has happened to Christopher Nolan? Has his ego grown so huge that he just doesn't give a crap about the audience anymore?Oh, and when the sound effects, score, etc rise in volume, and there's still dialogue? They raise the level of the dialogue too. Okay, I get why, but all the background sounds/effects/score/etc should not go SO loud that it drowns out the already-unintelligible dialogue. Ridiculous.Acting is pretty weak from the leads (except for the bad guy, Kenneth Branagh, and his wife). Especially John David Washington. Is he horrible? No. But he's mediocre.We don't care about any of these characters. Story is such that, despite all the exposition in this movie, we really don't care whether any of these people live or die -- or whether the world ends or not. That's an epic fail in storytelling.And speaking of exposition... WTF? Probably 80% of this movie is exposition. That's an epic fail. If you have to keep stopping the story to tell us and explain what is going on, then you've failed in the writing and making of the movie. Hey, I'm all for complicated movies that have time travel in them. ""12 Monkeys"" (the movie) is one of the best. But no one HAS to see that movie twice to understand WTF is going on. And that movie doesn't stop its story every 5 minutes to explain to us what is going on and what has to happen next.Such a shame. Waste of a movie. This is not ""The Prestige"" or ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Momento."" So don't expect that if you take the plunge.",Tenet

529,Diablo1616,favourite Nolan film?,8,5 September 2020,"Tenet is certainly an extremely ambitious project even for a director like Nolan, who will use any means necessary to achieve his vision. The film is supposedly shot using zero green screens, not to mention less CGI than most romcoms, and it really shows. The spectacle is absolutely off the rails this time, with some of my favourite set pieces from any film ever. There was one action sequence in particular that I won't spoil, but I even preferred it to the infamous rotating hallway sequence in Inception. However where Tenet absolutely excels in it's action and scale, it completely fails to miss the mark with its exposition. I cannot count the sheer number of times a vital piece of storytelling was explained in a quick exchange that, if you somehow didn't hear, you will most likely not understand half of the proceeding events. They even used the classic 'fish out of the water' technique, in which the character is introduced to a new world of sorts, and taken through it step by step, but somehow the audience will still somehow not feel like they're learning with the protagonist. Maybe it's just the case that the brilliantly complex narrative is simply too hard to instantly comprehend in your first viewing, but I firmly believe it could've been handled better. On the bright side, Tenet doesn't rely on deep meanings in its story (unlike interstellar which felt almost like a Terrence Malick film), but rather leans into what Nolan is good at; Weaving intrigue and intricacy into the plot, and like in all of his previous attempts it works wonders. The film has perhaps one of my favourite iterations of the time travel formula, and once you to an extent understand what's going on you feel instant satisfaction. I'm certain the film will demand several viewings to get what is happening at all times, but for now I simply don't have the intellect to tell you if it makes 100% sense. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson make a fantastic duo, and I enjoyed every minute they shared on screen, however none of the other characters really resonated with me. Kenneth Branagh is a decent villain but at times it feels like he's just forcing his lines. Elizabeth Debicki was the pretty much the only character I could sympathise with, but at times she only felt there like a damsel in distress or a plot device, and they even took the time to try and flesh out her relationship with Washington, but then decided to take it absolutely nowhere. Something I realised when I walked out the cinema, was that I could barely remember any instance where the musical score was memorable. Ludwig Görrason's soundtrack is simply quite unremarkable. It's certainly not bad, and it suits the atmosphere well, but in comparison to both Zimmer and Julyan's work in other Christopher Nolan movies it just feels lacklustre at times. To sum up, Tenet is certainly a highly enjoyable action movie, and for spectacle alone it's worth seeing on the big screen, but a mediocre script, convoluted plot and an altogether forgettable ensemble cast prevent it from being anywhere near my favourite Nolan film.",Tenet
530,adamstommy,Disappointed.,1,27 August 2020,"First of all, I don't understand the ""hype"" around this movie. I went into it with an open mind not knowing what to expect and I was VERY disappointed. The music score was horrendous, the acting was a mixed bag, and the story is hard to comprehend with your first watch. This movie tried to succeed, but it crashes in burns in a ""stylish"" fashion.",Tenet
531,verminhater,Probably very good but how can you tell?,5,30 November 2020,With such a massively convoluted plot why is the sound so bad that mumbling and incoherence add to an inability to follow the plot. Such a mind bender needs very careful explanation and this viewer simply didn't get that leaving me clueless as to what was happening and why. When you confuse the audience there is no chance of them appreciating the film and I don't think that thought ever occurred to the makers of Tenet. A shame really as I suspect that it could be turned into a really good film simply by allowing the audience to follow the plot.,Tenet
532,sahebabdullah,Very messy & confusing movie,5,23 May 2021,Tried to like Nolan's Tenet but it is so much mess with a very confusing story/narrative.

535,phelectric,"Can't hear the dialogue, and you need to.",5,18 December 2020,"There's some serious issues with this movie.1) Horrible sound (see next points)
2) You can only understand about 50% of what they say. It's like trying to listen to people mumbling extremely fast, and they are spewing out information that is critical to understanding the plot.
3) Loud music is played right over some of the talking, like it wasn't hard enough already.
4) Sound effects and music are at max audio levels.
5) Plot line is a little weird. It just goes straight into it and fast and it's pretty well just mushed all together, and you can't hear any of the details anyway.
6) Casting, not the best. Pretty weird choices. Pretty bland and mechanical acting. Didn't care about any of the characters, mainly because all stories ans scripts both sucked.
7) The inverted people??? How would that really work? Your driving and walking forward, but it's actually in reverse, everyone else sees it in reverse. But it's not really reverse for you, just the physics are reversed? Wouldn't you need to be walking backwards and doing everything backwards.
8) It aims to be complicated, and it is, but also equally confusing and that makes for an unpleasant experience.
9) you will need subtitles.... even if the movies is in the same language as you speak. Only way I could understand what's going on. Also read fast.
10) This movie is almost good, but at the end it's just forgettable. Does not have the blockbuster effect. It's just a mess.
11) this movie is the Cyberpunk2077 of movies. Huge budget, extended release time. However once released just falls flat and makes you think this was all just way to overhyped, they never got to finish the movie. I think they were running out of money and just had to release it. I sincerely regret paying $20 for it. I feel as I should get a refund but won't ask for it as I did watch it all.
This will go down as another Hollywood Covid disaster. Really how bad is Hollywood these days. I haven't seen a movie that I thought was just a terrific movie in quite sometime. These actors and directors are making millions. All they can do it reboot old ideas as no one had an original story in their brain. I'm so sick of Marvel movies and remakes that sucks. To me I'd rather just pay $12 month to streaming services and watch their decent content than drop $20 to watch 2 hours of some Hollywood mess.It's just a joke these days. And I'm sorry peeps. I really am. I feel for all of you having to stomach this junk they feel so highly about. It's just plain trash.",Tenet
536,sme3,Excellent Nonsense,8,13 March 2021,"Early in the film, one character explains that this makes no sense. Indeed, this is a film that makes no sense while nonetheless seeming like it might.

Everything about the production is top-notch.",Tenet
537,ayushparasar,An acquired taste,8,3 April 2021,"Christopher Nolan's got this thing of blowing audiences' minds every now and then. He did it immaculately with Inception and Interstellar and he's tried to go a step further with Tenet, so much so that he's missed a few basics! One of them being character development. In Inception we cared about Cob(Leo) and we cried when Mal(Marion) died. We cried even more when Cooper(Matthew McConaughy) meets Murphy(Jessica Chastain) in Interstellar climax. But in Tenet, we couldn't have cared less for the characters including the strong John D. Washington and the charming Robert Pattinson! Paper thin characters and unrelatable stuff makes it difficult to perceive the message of the film, one of the things Nolan keeps saying - ""it's always about the message"". Bit disappointed that he might have failed himself here.Ignore the above mentioned flaws and voilà- this film's a masterpiece- perhaps one of its kind. And it keeps getting better with every view. Thrilling acting, intense action, chilling score, alluring locations and do we even need to talk about Chris Nolan's direction?Love it or throw it away but you definitely cannot miss it.",Tenet
538,Akira-36,Memento on Steroid,6,28 September 2020,"I am at once entertained and confounded by Nolan's latest escapade. At its heart, Tenet is an ambitious retelling of the old time travel thriller genre, however it feels convoluted and seems to be deliberately confusing upon first viewing.After reading an online story beats and some fan theories, while combining them with my own, I've decided to stick with my original rating of 6.5 and perhaps in time it will change.The movie was shot with sophistication and style, but there are too many plot contrivances with narrative bogged down by the weight of its own logic and inability to be coherent.The sound and dialogue seem to be designed to make it hard for viewers to understand and thus enjoy the story arcs and its conclusion. Characters were talking with heavy accents, behind masks and exposition upon exposition that were dominated by the background music or sound effects.And like Nolan's recent movies, Tenet is almost bereft of emotion, where he seems to delight in the technicality of his sci-fi world more than telling a good story. There are drama and violence for sure but they were delivered with such cold precision and calculated structure that the amazing action pieces actually takes away from the story's cohesiveness.And by the time you reach the final act, either you are on board and are in awe with Nolan's masterpiece or totally dumb founded and feel the entire movie is one good looking mess that works only in his mind.Nolan makes incredible and thought-provoking movies but for me, his last truly great movie was Inception. And I feel that it has been a steady decline in storytelling quality and an increase of cold logic/technicality.In essence, Tenet is a revisit of Memento but on steroid. The muscles have taken over the healthy man within.",Tenet
539,inioi,Nolan didn´t do it again.,1,8 September 2020,"It´s a shame that Nolan has ended up being carried away by Hollywwood's silly action films.The script is at the service of the action scenes, (and not the other way around, as was the case in the excellent Memento), so what you can get is not more than the old same boring story: Good guys, bad guys. The good guys have to save the girl in the middle of many shots and explosions that shred your ears ..... as you can see, just another Hollywood action flick very similar to a video game.",Tenet
540,007Waffles,Predictable,6,13 June 2021,"Easy to solve and understand. The plot is as old as movies themselves. The timer is counting down and the world will end if you don't stop it, with people running backwards. Nothing new. I expected more.",Tenet
541,FabledGentleman,Quite spectacular,8,29 August 2020,"Early in the film one of the characters says: Don't try and make sense of it, just feel it. So that's what i did, and thankfully so. If you see this movie for the first time, and you try and make complete sense of the plot without having a doctors degree in astrophysics, your head will probably hurt. Your first viewing should be to just pay attention, and let the movie guide you forward (or backwards), don't try and put all the pieces together, because you can't. This is Nolan doing what he does best, which is manipulating time.It's a complex new film from Nolan, which previously has played with time in several of his films, but in different ways every time. From Different speeds in Inception and Interstellar to different time windows in which a story unfolds in Dunkirk, and the back and forth in Memento, Nolan seems to be obsessed with time. And by sticking to his guns as he calls it, he manages to make movies that looks like nothing before it. This is yet again, a movie only Nolan could have made.What i truly liked about this film is how Nolan from the very beginning show us hints about what's to come, but we don't yet know it. But when these small hints and sequences are finally revealed as the plot moves along, it's incredibly rewarding. It proves that he is a master of manipulation, which is a skill he truly needed to make this film, and movies like The Prestige. I'm not going to go into specifics how time works in this film, but it's a new take, from the trailers you already know it has something to with time inversion. Time that is moving backwards.For decades scientists have been discussing time, and how it works. For us humans, time moves forward. But does that mean it does that for everyone, or every thing? No. In quantum physics, there is no time, things move in all directions, and we humans are made up of atoms, which then does not move in one direction. But yet, we feel it that way.This movie's plot is anchored in these laws of quantum physics. Just like Nolan also used laws of physics in Interstellar for example, to describe how a spinning black hole can slow time so much that 1 hour close to it, equaled many many years on Earth. So even if Tenet for many people, won't make any sense, just see the movie for the first time with an open mind.If you can just enjoy the spectacular action sequences, the constant tension, the pounding music and the beautiful cinematography, this movie delivers pure and solid entertainment.I tried to put myself in Nolan's shoes after i saw this film. I thought to myself, if i had come up with this story, i would likely have doubted myself on every turn, because i could not let go, the amount of ifs and buts would explode my cranium.But I felt i understood the time trickery quite well in this film, and i enjoyed the entertainment for what it was, and i think it's one of the best action films, probably the best so far, this year. But i also felt like this movie was missing something, it might be a lack of character development, in which this movie has almost none. It might also be that i took a close look at some of the scenes closer to the climax, which was without doubt very difficult to coordinate and film, but i saw several mistakes.But all in all, what a spectacular film. Nolan is the only one in the industry that can make a film like this. It's just a bit sad he values plot and action more than connection with the characters, in which this movie needed a little bit more.8/10",Tenet

545,pugheaven,Absolute Drivel,1,23 January 2021,"WOW, I never ever thought I'd see the day with Nolan, however, here it is. I've turned this absolute drivel off after 1 hour and 30 minutes of boredom.... and this becomes only the 3rd film (as in a proper budget film) that I've ever turned off...So, where do I start:1). The sound and musical soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever heard going from one extreme to another with zero flow or class (watching the 4k version disc). It's a crass bombastic noise fest one minute (even when not that much happening on screen) and then it's a muffled mess.2). The lead being John David Washington is one of the dullest leading me performances I've seen in a long long time. Absolutely no screen presence or charisma to be leading a film like this... astoundingly bad.3). What the hell is it with Nolan and flipping between aspect ratios. I love the fact that for years (used exceptionally in The Dark Night) he uses IMAX footage... however when he's done this in the past and gone full screen he's done it at the right time where it enhances the film in action scenes etc. In this, he's just randomly flipping the aspect ratio, switching between 2.20:1 and 1.78:1 at the most seemingly random momentswhenever he feels the need and it becomes tiresome!4). If I get 1 hour and 30 minutes into a film, I expect to have a story... absolutely nothing here of interest... I'm sure it all becomes clear later on and we actually get a story, I'm sure we do. However, I simply don't even want to know what that story is.This to me is the first time in his career he's produced bloated, bland, noisy incomprehensible garbage and I'm still in shock, I've been a fan of his work for many years now and he's never let me down but this... this 4k disc at £20 will be used as a frisbee for the dog.1/10 it will be getting from me and how the hell this has peoples attention is beyond me. I reckon we could've just started the film where I left it after 90 minutes and carry from there lol.

546,MooWoolf1,Nolan wanted too much,5,30 August 2020,"I would like to point out that I'm a Nolan fan.The movie starts out good, some elements might be familiar to you from previous Nolan movies.It goes pretty well, it's interesting, it's understandable but not simple, the characters keep going and suddenly a scene comes in with the unnecessary purpose of explanation. While providing explanation of the plot, visually becomes extremely confusing. (I heard people saying they totally lost how and what is going on.)I also would like to highlight that important questions about the plot do not get answers, while I was waiting for it.So after that scene the story went on slowly because the movie heavily started to focus on action scenes. Which was entertaining but it became boring pretty fast.The cinematography due to these action sequences suffers a lot. I was not satisfied with the visual atmosphere neither.During the third act the action sequences going to confuse people totally. In my personal opinion the movie during the third act did not cared about it's own rules. You see 3 groups running back and forth, shooting and not shooting, the main plot goes on and Nolan distracts you for no reason with a nonsense subplot. Extras and actors running around not knowing what they do. It is literally visible on screen.At the end our characters end up without real characters. They do not feel like real people in a world. They do not feel like important people. They do not act like what they should have. All this filled with an OK dialogues at best! Sadly..So when you watch Bale in a Nolan movie, you see and believe you're watching Batman. When you see Matthew, you see and believe he is a father and wants to save the people and his kids. When you watch Leo, you believe it. When you watch Hugh, you believe it even tho, he plays a magician!In this movie, a character from the movie was highlighted for that he would die for people, basically. Later in the movie, he would sacrifice the whole world for one person, who doesn't matter at all in the story. And it didn't feel right in the story. You'll not feel and believe these actors.. Their characters are just too weak for that, the movie focused too much on the action and less on the plot and the characters that made Nolan's movies successful.The people giving it more than a 6 are DID NOT UNDERSTAND what they were watching. Their eyes liked what they saw and that's all.I also highly doubt that there was a test screening. Otherwise the movie would have been 30-40 minutes shorter. More focused on the story. Nolan wrote this script in a few weeks. Not years..",Tenet

The plot is simple enough, but the central idea is exceedingly complicated.

Fortunately, the requisite for understanding is all there, and following some supplementary reading and a second viewing, the film is extremely satisfying. It's not for everyone, and it's not easy, but it is brilliant.

552,cristinalinderman,A uniquely fresh mind-blowing masterpiece.,9,2 October 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The brilliant director Christopher Nolan brought a mind-blowing masterpiece and I love how he keeps his films uniquely fresh. To really have a more of understanding what is going on, one needs to be open-minded, and the most important piece is to sharpen the senses of sight and sound. One can't even blink because there are several important details that it will be coming back to. This story sets an interesting take of time and how magnificent it was projected. What fun it was noticing the details and putting it all together before the film reveals it, and some things are not officially revealed but it is still there for one to place everything. I think this movie became my favorite film by Christopher Nolan! because it was profoundly complex and he likes to intensify our minds, how I love to analyze everything. This is one of the best time movies ever because he is not only applying known thoughts of time, he did it with his own distinguished twist. The inverted scenes were thrilling, every effect was intense and kept me completely on the edge. The title TENET was another bright puzzle, the significance was very clever. The director always manages to sneak in the major emotional theme behind the literal one, like he did in his latest films and it is one of the things that makes him my favorite director.The composer Ludwig Göransson sets greatly the sci-fi in its thriller and the concept of time. I liked the theme and not only the script keeps one on edge it was also with the help of his music. Even though I liked it I wanted something more and ever since it was known that Hans Zimmer will not be the composer I was on the fence for the music of this film. I love the partnership between Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer, both of them help each other to create greatness. Even though Hans Zimmer wasn't the composer Ludwig Göransson did a great job but still, his music was missing a lot of things. Ludwig Göransson had set the TENET theme but the composer failed to create themes for one to feel the emotions of the characters through music, a mistake that Hans Zimmer wouldn't have made because Hans Zimmer is known to have more than one theme in a film. I will always wonder what would Hans Zimmer bring to the table for this film, such a shame no one will ever find out.I was disappointed in the end credits because I always love to stay until the very end to enjoy the music but I was shocked that the first music was a song called The Plan by Travis Scott. The rhythm syncs perfectly with the film and the lyrics but the vocal music didn't fit at all. This film shouldn't have vocal music no matter if it was only used on the end credits. Thankfully it was only one and the second music was the score for the film that was the way that should have started the end credits.The cast was out of this world! especially John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and Kenneth Branagh, they all deserve to be recognized for their phenomenal performances. The scenes between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson flowed naturally and their interactions are an absolute enjoyment. I hope that Christopher Nolan's future project would add Elizabeth Debicki since he is known for using the same actors. She was mesmerizing I wanted more scenes for her but I understand that in this kind of story her scenes were fair but she deserves to have more and hopefully, this wouldn't be the last time he cast her in his films.",Tenet
553,igl-55560,Well... pff,8,20 December 2020,"I'm a huge fan of time travel theme movies and that one didn't impress me much.
When Robert Pattinson's character let the attacker go and begged for the life of the other, I had already got the twist and wished I was wrong.
The only element that got me off guard was the first meeting with the wife when she explained that another woman was diving from the boat and I finally got that it was her : that scene was interesting.
Apart from that I couldn't careless about the end battle for the algorithm and at that point I really didn't care about the protagonist explaining how and why he would try to undo what others wanted to do.
I was disappointed on many levels but I still rate that movie an 8 out of 10, because seriously I wasn't aware that I had spent more than 2 hours watching it (I really thought it was just 90 minutes, even less).
While watching it, I was thinking about Idris Elba, James Bond movies, great ideas.

A few times scenes are cut midway and just splice into the next one.. you are like, wait, is this supposed to be intentional; did we just skip forward 30 seconds during a chase? The answer is no, not intentional movie design! It is just bad editing and somebody not wanting to reshooot scenes OR tryin to cut down on time. It is after all, 2h30m long! Could have actually kept those 5 minutes in and had proper transitions but it is not my show.....At the end of that long production, nothing is explained, nothing, nothing really matters and you are left with something of a cliffhanger for a sequel.Such a pity... this could have been a cult classic.

555,realalexrice,I've seen it 3 times.. and I love it,8,8 June 2021,"He's called the protagonist so that people can never trace him back originally to who he is and undo the whole plot that has started before the credits. He controls the whole narrative through the future, even if he doesn't know it at the start.I'm sorry but really it's quite dumb how people who like Nolan's movies always harp on how necessary it is to view his movies more than once but it seems everyone has skipped on returning to this, which is definitely a mistake. I will continue to revisit this one, Ludwig's score is addictive alone. Nolan's best and that's not hard for me to say but still...16:18 into the movie: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it.""25:03: ""Started without you. Hope you don't mind""
""I'll catch up.""It's an absolutely great time that is genuinely undermined by Branagh's simultaneously awful and hilarious performance. Is it intentional? Is he chewing the scenery? I don't know... But, I am pretty much down with everything else in this movie, even the absurdly massive finale. It's safe to say as well after watching this another time that I'm not into this movie for anything other than the entertainment value and excitement it brings while watching. It has so many of Nolan's best moments, with the opening to this film probably being my favorite thing Nolan has done yet.It's also truly refreshing in rewatching this in a place where I get the dialogue and Ludwig's absolutely awesome score properly mixed to my ears limit. I do recommend watching at home if you can with a better (or at least customizable sound system), subtitles aren't really necessary though after a second watch.",Tenet
556,TheProteanGirl,Enjoyable but has plotholes,5,28 August 2020,"I'm so confused about something. Just like they teach in chemistry if you break a glass there's a million particles everywhere of said broken glass, to reverse that you'd need to do the EXACT (mirror) same thing in a backwards motion to redo the action so how is this possible in the movie? When the protagonist is fighting hinself from the past in that freeport room with the 3 bullets in the glass he isn't doing the reverse of what he did he is just defending hinself against himself to get through (outside) to see Neil bring Kat who is now saved. This makes no sense to me, idk if I'm missing something. Also, how unrealistic is it to expect hin to remember every fight move he did in the forward direction to do it backwards?? They chuck it up to instinct but never explain wth that even means... Just a feeling but ok what is that feeling is it a superpower or something? Makes no sense.Also, if Neil just meets the protagonist in the future but dies after meeting him in that bomb area where we see the string how can the consistency of the theme of infinite loops (which is what this movie is alluding to at one point protagonist says to the indian woman ""you have to stop thinking linearly"") be possible? He died there so how would he ""un-die"" to then reverse again and meet him in the future? Neil is basically going in reverse since he met the protagonist? So how does that work when he switches while hes with the protagonist in different scenes? They play around with grandfather paradoxe but then show that fate is kinda playing a part here because Neil changes direction from when he leaves the helicopter with blue team and saves the protagonists life by shooting the guy at the gate of the detonation and in turn dying himself there.Idk I read explanations but I'm still lost. Maybe it's cause I question everything and the more complexe stuff you delve in the more plotholes it generally has (I mean this fantasy and wishy washy pseudo-science as explanations on how this time thing originated they chuck it up to ""we don't know someone in the future does don't question it""). I get it's Nolan, it's still a cool movie and all and I loved many others of his a lot, but when you get into these questions it becomes clear there's many plotholes (beyond what I mentioned as well). Enjoyable, but not consistent (imo).",Tenet

558,mr_sharma,Chris Nolan's least accessible film,6,1 September 2020,"There were four of us who watched this and we all agree on this film.I think I've watched all of Chris Nolan's films (except Following - was that his? I'm not googling it).Like almost everyone I've enjoyed them all.I'll get to the point.Chris Nolan should take a long time out and fix scripts, he writes, before presenting them to us.The central idea in this film is novel. It actually, once you understand it, is straightforward to understand, unique and clever.When you write a script based on this central idea (I am trying not to say much about this film in case I spoil it), you should really attempt to educate the audience better.It took almost half the film (and may be that is the point artistically - the halfway point) before I sort of understood some of what was going on. Then when you understand it, you have no time to digest or be explained things as the plot eventually gets everything and kitchen sink thrown at it.May be concept requires a second viewing to appreciate it. May be the concept was not explained well enough when you did watch it the first time.You see characters, in films, should be asking questions that the audience want answering and explaining. There is a storytelling technique to handholding an audience through a plot. It's not easy but that's why we have screenwriters there to do their magic to get the information to us.And here is the problem. Christopher Nolan is not a screenwriter who deals with audiences taking a breather. He is one who works out the machinations of what's going to happen and presents it logically. It's like a formula being presented where you have to go over it many times before you get it and it gets more complicated to understand if the writer, who presents that formula, isn't very good at understanding the audience. Audiences aren't in on it and nor are they super whizzes. They need things explained in a manner that allows the story to flow and in a way that doesn't lose them.Now you could say, Chris Nolan's is a great writer...he did Batman, Prestige etc but you're missing the vital ingredient here and that is his brother Jonathan.He's really the showman. He's the one that takes a complicated idea and writes a screenplay that gives the audience ample time to get with what's being shown. You may have questions sure but not questions like ""what the hell was going on?"".In the case of Dunkirk, there wasn't a complicated idea, and it was a film for a director to sink his teeth into. Music was great. Visuals were great. Plot was easy to follow and didn't distract. It wasn't ""inception"" in it's mind bendiness and even then you followed most of what was going on in ""inception"".Tenet not only has the problem of a over (or is it very?) complicated plot, but it also fails in the use of sound and visuals.The print is so contrasty that there are scenes, in the film, that you can't make out who is who. A dark face in a dark room for example. The sound is so loud at points, that you simply can't hear what is being said so you lose the thread of what's going on. The editing, in parts, is so quick (especially the last third), you miss what's just happened.This all adds to the problem of following the plot.You simply can't.And I feel that when you have to google a video to explain the film to you, there is something wrong in the way the film presented itself.I mean we all do that with twisty turny plots, google after, BUT when the person explaining it had to watch the film multiple times to understand it themselves then I think the plot is too complex.Don't get me wrong, this is not a boring film. It keeps you engaged but most of the time you are left scratching your head hoping that someone will explain what just happened.It's got a spy thriller vibe and you can see the Batman influences.Ultimately, this film is an interesting classic in the making not because the film is a classic but because you will need to buy the blu ray to watch it again and again to understand all the different things that happened and why....and even then you'll still need someone to explain things.Chris Nolan has really worked hard on putting the pieces of a puzzle together (there is a certain circularity to it) but what he has failed to do is present that puzzle that makes people want to buy it.It's not so much a Rubik's cube or Jenga but more Klingon Chess....the rules are not obvious.Pity. I personally would wait for the Blu Ray so you can rewatch it.",Tenet

Conceptually, the premise is solid, however without going into chapter and verse, it seems like Nolan tried to 'outNolan' himself.
The script lacks character development, it arbitrarily seems to jump all over the place, without the finesse of a Bourne plot.
Rather than guide you through I felt like the action scenes were my adrenaline shots to make up for forgettable and poorly handked script.I know most will suggest that I rewatch to understand the detail, the nuances - I might be odd but I rewatch movies because I loved them, the journey was extraordinary - not rewatch to understand it.Two of my absolute, all time favourite movies are 'Interstellar' and 'Inception' - sadly Tenet is not.",Tenet

565,j-madej,"Perhaps 'T E N E T"" is Nolan's audition for the next Bond movie.",8,30 August 2020,"T E N E T review by Janusz Madej
One cryptic sentence seemed to be used constantly in marketing of the latest blockbuster the 'T E N E T"" written and directed by Christopher Nolan which has been shown it trailers:
""All I have for you is a word: Tenet. It'll open the right doors, some of the wrong ones too.""
When last year first teasers were relisted the audience were privy to a few scenes shrouded in mystery.
The plot was largely unknown and all we knew is that Nolan is working on a film which will center on the world of international espionage.The veil of mystery and ongoing rumors about the plot drove the anticipation of the audience to the limit and in times of pandemic T E N E T was touted as the potential savior of the film industry.
When expectations are so high it is easy to get disappointed...
I really wanted to like this film, in fact ever since the filming started I felt that this was the most anticipated movie of the year for me. Lensed by current frequent collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema with depthful Nolan script writing I knew we are looking for a treat. The plot is hard to communicate without trying to explain too much:
""Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.""
Let me start by saying that the T E N E T is not Nolan's best work.
In essence the premise for it is more enchanting then its execution. As with Nolan's previous movies this one feels a bit overindulgent. When director maintains full creative power over film making process he is running a risk of disconnection from the audience.
Chris always makes movies for intellectual audience and expects them to do their part by being as smart as he.
Sadly that is the problem with most of Nolan's cinematography. It seems that he makes movies for himself first, ""I want to make a movie I would like to see"" type thing. By trying to communicate very confusing story line we get plenty of expositions through the dialog. Basically characters are sitting around and explain to the audience the plot.
Nolan removed plenty of the over emotionality which he used in ""INTERSTELLAR"" and kept it very emotionally dry.
Considering that this is espionage story we get very little background stories about the characters which limits our emotional attachments as the plot thickens. The protagonist of the story John David Washington (son of Denzel Washington) is credited as exactly the 'Protagonist"". After his success in the ""BlackKlansmen"" Washington seems to be on the row securing lead role in this action blockbuster. Although not as charismatic and physically imposing as his father, John David does a good job of trying to connect with the audience. However to some extant I find his presence not strong enough to carry the movie. The action fight scenes work, but the height difference between him and his potential love interest Elizabeth Debicki is very noticeable and creates romantic disparity which audience can feel. In general all the scenes which forward plot through dialog don't seemed to work very well. That has been a key criticism of Nolan's movies, that he uses too much dialog based exposition and just like in 'INCEPTION"" it can get very confusing specially with the sound mix which puts music and sound FX in foreground making dialog almost inaudible. By keeping the backstory of the main characters to minimum 'T E N E T"" offers type of emotional dryness. Although the stakes are high we don't seem to care much about our characters, because we are not emotionally invested in their struggle.
For this type of movie to work you need powerful antagonist and Kenneth Branagh does not disappoint.
Every scene he is in he is ""chewing"" the scenery but to be 100% honest as Russian impressions go his is good but not great. Russians have this masculine heaviness which is hard to duplicate and I don't talk about the accent because Branagh did well implementing it.
It just that for a man who has nothing to live for he haven't fully inhabit the mafia boss avatar.
Other performances seems solid specially Robert Pattinson although he still lacks bravado and charisma.
Groundbreaking in its concept of time reversal it feels like
T E N E T has been a concept movie.
""Would it be cinematic to revers things in the scene and make things visually impressive? ""
Yes, lets based the whole film on that premise and so Nolan did.
By replacing frequent score collaborator Hans Zimmerman with Ludwig Göransson, Nolan took the emotionality away from the movie and brought a sense of dryness.
Perhaps 'T E N E T"" is Nolan's audition for the next Bond movie.
Considering actions scenes they are done very well and with epic scope without use of green screen mostly captured in camera.
But the action finally of the movie felt disappointing for me, staged as a sort of large scale confusing 'paintball match"" with building and explosions detonating and being reversed in time. All of that looks visually impressive but somehow not truly fulfilling.
T E N E T was shoot using 70mm IMAX camera and I would suggest to see it in IMAX as Nolan intended.
I avoided writing about the key plot spoilers, specially by the end as we are nearing conclusion we are confronted with twists and turns which feels a little forced and confusing. Due to that fact I see the audience having to come for multiple viewings which should enhance the box office.
Perhaps another line from the film is fitting here.
""Try to not understand it, feel it""
Bottom line T E N E T is one of these movies which might gain more acclaim as time passes and who knows perhaps 5 years from now we will truly understand an impact T E N E T had on post pandemic film industry.",Tenet
566,isabellacheng,Why do people say they have to watch it multiple times to understand?,9,5 December 2020,"No spoilers here, we already know from the trailers that the movie is about time moving backward.In the movie, regardless of whether time in the environment is flowing forward or backward, we as audience are always following the protagonist's point-of-view, which is always going forward! What's there to be confused about? The usual fallacies in time travel, like time loops and paradoxes are discussed but entirely avoided in the movie!Furthermore, there are more than enough visual cues and expositions to let the audience know whether the protagonist is currently moving forwards or backwards. My only gripe is there being too much exposition! After the protagonist's recruitment, four full minutes of explanation of how time is flowing backward. After a confrontation in the middle of the movie, there are another four minutes of exposition. The climax of the movie begins with over three minutes of exposition of the plan! Unlike Memento (2000), there is no puzzle to piece together in Tenet, because the characters always explain everything in complete sentences without even trying to be mysterious!Tenet is one of those legends that takes one concept, then explore and extrapolate and exhaust everything possible with this new idea. Everyone learns basic geometry in middle school, and quoting Wikipedia's first paragraph on Euclidean Geometry: ""Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these."" Hundreds of theorems were derived from only five axioms! Such beauty! Tenet also reminds of the computer game ""Linelight"" (2017), which takes a glowing line of light moving in a one dimensional path, and turns it into an amazing puzzle-solving experience. I would love for more people to appreciate this masterpiece, but that wouldn't happen if people don't even bother to try.",Tenet
567,lukecon-63436,"Visually impressive, weak on story/plot",4,4 May 2021,"This is one of those films in which you will be impressed by the engaging visual effects and the action sequences that are frequent in the film, but you will probably find yourself struggling to keep up with the plot. This isn't an easy film to understand, and certainly one that will leave you scratching your head and wondering: What was Christopher Nolan thinking when he wrote this?Now, first of all, I love Christopher Nolan and he is a very talented filmmaker and writer. However, this film just didn't work for me--and for many reasons which I will explain here.1. Don't expect too much action in this film. As a matter of fact, a lot of the film is really just dialogue and characters talking about things that don't make sense to the viewer. Now, why is that? Well, first of all, the film doesn't keep you engaged/interested in the characters and the storyline. Second of all, the dialogue. Oh, dear, the dialogue feels very boring when the characters are doing nothing but talking and walking around. Now, there are moments when I was indeed engaged by the dialogue, but maybe those moments were in the first 20 minutes of the film.Because the first 20-30 minutes of the film indeed are perfect. It sets up the conflict and characters just fine, and the action sequence is visually impressive. However, later on in the film is when things start to fall apart. And I mean REALLY fall apart.In terms of story, the film doesn't do a very good job at explaining its story--and I started finding myself increasingly distant from whichever situations the characters were encountering.2. Watch this film with subtitles. If you don't watch this film using subtitles, it will probably be very hard to understand, especially since a lot of the time, you need to really be listening and paying attention to what characters are saying.However, a problem I have with this is that I like when a film is able to effectively explain something to me WITHOUT subtitles. That proves to me that the writer was able to engage me into the storyline without me having to turn the subtitles on. The story should just be engaging and understandable without me even having to see it a second time.3. You just can't catch up to whatever it is that's going on. This is a major problem I have with the film. For example, the inversion scenes. A problem I have with these scenes is that a lot of the time, you can't tell who's who. What I mean by this, is that in one inversion scene, I was trying to figure out whether the inverted subject was fighting the security guard or whether it was the un-inverted subject fighting the guard in reverse.Things just happen too fast in the film for you to even be catching up to whatever it is that's going on. In another scene, a woman is repeatedly shot--and it appears that the reverse effect may be used in this scene. However, it is very difficult to tell because Nolan just speeds it up without even bothering to explain to us the audience.4. The characters weren't explained well enough. First of all, we don't know a lot about the main character (played by John David Washington), and most of the time he doesn't have much of an expression on his face--he is a very stoic and dull character, and this doesn't really offer a lot to help us understand the character. Other characters were better developed than this character, but at the same time, the film could use a lot of rewriting.Essentially, to sum it up in one sentence, this feels like it was a first draft that needs some rewriting, because it certainly doesn't feel like a final draft.",Tenet
568,Bek204,"""Don't try to understand it, FEEL IT""",8,10 September 2020,"The protagonist (John David Washington) is set in a time-bending, dangerous mission to prevent World War 3 from happening.Tenet is a complex and a powerful movie, it's not Christopher Nolan's best movie but it's also not his worst one, for those who are saying that it's not as good as Inception or Batman: the dark knight, I agree but let's be clear, I don't think there will be a movie in the same level as Inception or Batman: the dark knight, these two movies are for sure Nolan's masterpieces, so I won't compare Tenet to Nolan's past movies.John David Washington's performance was so powerful, he was truly amazing and can't imagine the movie without him, Robert Pattison (plays Neil) was also amazing and surprised me with his great performance, and Elizabeth Debcki (plays Kat) who I wasn't surprised how amazing she is in Tenet and that's because ever since I saw her in ""Widows"" (2018) I said that the next time she'll be in a big movie, she'll do a great job with her performance, and that's what happened in Tenet, her facial expressions and the way she wants to introduce or express her character's feelings whether it's happiness, sadness or grief, she'll know how to express it perfectly. In the end, the cast of Tenet was so amazing and every choice was perfect except for one, Kenneth Branagh (plays Andrei Sator) who has a big / important role in the film, I didn't feel his acting that much especially that he plays the villain and I felt like he was trying so bad to show us how his character is the villain but couldn't, I think many other actors can give us a better performance.The music that was so amazing and when you hear it you'll think that it's composed by Hans Zimmer but you'll be surprised that it's not. The music in Tenet is composed by Ludwig Göransson who I think will have a great career especially after I heard the music of Tenet, I mean he already composed the music of ""Black Panther"" (2018) which was great and he won an Oscar but what's saying is that I can't wait to hear his music in the upcoming movies, great choice of music. And also the song Called: The Plan by: Travis Scott was amazing, really loved it.Sound mixing and sound editing were bad, felt like in some scenes I was struggling to understand the speech, I don't know if it was me or the theatre that I was in, or is it the movie itself?? In some scenes felt like something was wrong and the words weren't clear and the music was louder than the speech.The production design was fascinating, and the camera angles made it look way better.The opening scene of the movie was a perfect way to start the movie, loved the action in it and it'll make you feel that what's coming next will be better. The action scenes in the whole movie were so impressive anyways they might seem normal and in many movies but in Tenet they were different because to see people who are moving backwards and moving onwards fight or are in a highway chase is just so impressive and mind-blowing.Cinematography & colors were great, especially that room that the lights in it were red and blue was very cool.The fact the movie didn't use green screens is just mind blowing, i mean it's not a new thing for Nolan but it's just so shocking that all these scenes were ACTUALLY filmed, that airplane crash scene is just crazy and can't imagine how it looked like in real life, or the chasing car scenes, or all the reversed scenes, amazing and shocking work.Christopher Nolan is a director that likes his movie to be so complex and make his audience ask many questions that's why Tenet in a movie that you have to watch more than once, and you have to watch it on the big screen (way better if it's IMAX) to have the perfect experience. The movie is a complex one and very hard to understand, but with all of that, I enjoyed watching it and it's such a powerful movie with powerful action scenes and story that I didn't find anything to hate about.My rating is: 8/10.",Tenet
569,nlgthunder,A good idea that could've been developed and explained better,7,10 January 2021,"I think that Washington and Pattinson did great with this film. Their performances were really good for what I felt each of their characters should be. The production value was also high (aside from the sound editing. My husband and I stopped thirty minutes in, put subtitles on and restarted) as I have come to expect for a Nolan film. Visually appealing with great directing style and choices.Now to the plot. I think the overall idea is cool and has potential but I'm not totally convinced it was executed properly. The introduction to the point of the film is choppy and off kilter. I feel as though there was a lot of time wasted, introducing some characters we never see again that piecemeal us closer to figuring out what's actually going on. I think if the beginning of the film had focused more on getting to the point, the other two hours could have been used to make that point more believable. I appreciate the concept, and I will most likely rewatch this film as I have every other Nolan film. But it definitely has its weaknesses that can't be overlooked. To call it a bad movie feels unfair, but it does seem like there is a lot missing, not that I'm just not getting it.",Tenet
570,breathedirt,Ridiculous plot with many holes and boring/unlikeable characters. Read if you want to know why.,5,8 December 2020,"So if for humans, an increasing entropy means growing older (or moving 'forward' in time or, if you will, getting 'disorganized'), Nolan perhaps thought that reversing it to decreasing entropy by having his movie's characters enter certain devices would mean growing younger (or going 'back' in time). I could freeze my body and 'slow down' the entropy but the freezing would hardly make me younger. Apart from the fact that Robert Pattinson is a terrible actor and the other guy was also nothing special, there were many plot holes even if we accept the idea that one could go in the opposite direction (I.e. back in time) if they reversed their entropy, for example, why were objects such as cars moving backward with them if they did not enter the said devices with those objects? Why did fire become ice? Why were they able to see other objects in the 'past' normally? Did they take the sunlight with them along with the oxygen masks? Sorry, Nolan, this one was not good.",Tenet
571,achmoye,A disappointing mess,2,2 December 2020,"As many here noticed, it is incredibly frustrating to need a second watching to understand a movie. So I won't do it. Because when you do this kind of movies, you need to be sure that the first watching will already be a pleasure. It's not. Compare it with the sixth sense. When you don't know the end, you miss some details, and if you watch it twice it can be interesting but you don't have to do it. Here, the first watching is a pain and you HAVE to watch it twice to understand. Not because it's very intellectual. Not even because it uses some SF concepts. I've read a lot about time travel, I'm not scared of theses stories. No, it's the horrible dialogues and exposition scene that messes up the movie.
I have no idea why the dialogues are that fast but it's beyond ridiculous. Characters are almost cutting each other off, like they're gonna miss a train or something. And this for the whole duration of the movie, so I had to use subtitles, like I suddenly forgot the English language.
So I won't do my homework and watch it again because I wanted an experience, not a working task.The music is overly dramatic. It's good to have overwhelming atmosphere when the scene is important and intense, but there is heavy music all the time for 2 hours, so it loses all signification. It's rare to see epic music so badly used.Also, Robbert Pattinson is pretty good, but the MC has no emotion whatsoever. You might as well put a robot. It is a SF movie anyway.
Let's mention that the first scene is a mass shooting in a concert hall, like the 2015 attacks in France. It was very shocking to see that, and Nolan couldn't possibly ignore this fact. That is such a low-key way to make his movie stand out.The whole thing reminded me of the new brainless James Bond movies, when MC need to get some item to prevent the world from total extinction, which require a lot of pew-pew (that is the official term) and car racing (there is even a blonde). I hate this ""rich"" visuals with big cars, big boats, even planes, just to make things look expensive. Where is the story ?So, Nolan added some time reversing stuff to make things complicated and intellectual, but it doesn't really make sense. Maybe it does to him, to the writers even, but if it doesn't in the spectator's eye, then it doesn't matter. And the exposition scene doesn't explain anything, except that some object are time-reversed thanks to a future technology.
why does this work with people too, after half ot the movie ?do they stay reversed forever ?Does this property depends on the material ?what about the paradoxes ?What about the Tenet word ? They didn't use it a single time. Did they actually read their own story ?How reversed object are gonna possibly interact with normal objects ? The whole movie is based on this object having their own arrow of time but it cannot make sense. Some physicists argue that there is no arrow of time, like Minkowski's cube, but things still have to go ALL in a certain direction. Nolan's movie is just pure chaos.Because of the movie story, fight scenes are used twice and I couldn't believe it. I have to watch this again ?? Even if you watch the movie once, you get some stuff twice. What a scam.I hate the pseudo-scientific talk that is supposed to make everyone asleep and fall for it. So the objects are time-reversed because of some future radiation stuff. Yeah sure. I'm sorry but I love science, so I can't love this movie.The idea that some kind of formula is gonna suddenly make us able to violate laws of physics is so childish.We know gravity's law, are we able to control gravity ?The moral at the end is so pseudo-philosophical and forced that it shouldn't make it to the second draft.

In that regard is not his best moment.I like Robert Pattinson in the supporting role, he turned out to be a very charismatic actor.Elizabeth Debicki is a beauty to behold.The ""protagonist"" doesn't have a motivation, is sort of a plot device, could have used some script treatment.John David Washington has no charisma. Bad choice. Idris Elba could have done a better job.I watched it with subtitles so I cannot complain about the sound.Travel in time concept is entertaining.Great special and practical special effects as expected.Worth wachting it one time.

574,lhunt-9,Nolan's best since Memento,10,24 December 2020,"Interestingly, Mr. Nolan returns to many of the themes of Memento here, obviously with an unimaginably higher budget, far more action and technical events, and an even more complicated story line (Memento was mind twisting enough!). I watch all movies with subtitles, and will agree with other viewers that I would have had no idea what anybody was talking about without them. I also watched about ten Tenet overviews before watching the film, many with ""heavy spoilers."" Believe me, the spoilers don't matter. The film is so challenging to figure out, that even with a printed plot outline in your hands, it would still be tricky to decipher the action and intrigue the first time through. Despite this, there is plenty I still don't understand --- though this is in itself no concern at all.That is, this is an astoundingly finely crafted film. As many have commented, Tenet is certainly never boring. Despite the overwhelming complexity, it actually does still mostly make sense, as far as I can make out.But most importantly, and in conclusion: (1) this is an absolutely epic scifi story --- these come along rarely, and there are none most years; (2) the characters are developed sufficiently in my view (their backgrounds are intentionally left mysterious, so don't get led off base by that plot device); (3) the concepts are logically and even scientifically interesting (I thought this was the problem with Interstellar, as the central premise was not even remotely scientific, it was a fantasy movie, not a science movie); (4) the time travel concept is unique, innovative, and requires some scientific awareness, even if the premise is, again, not itself a scientific one; (5) the acting is tier one all around; and (6) the total experience is immersive, substantial, engaging, thought-provoking, and humanly interesting.Nolan has therefore knocked it out of the park with Tenet. This will stand for years as one of the great science fiction movies. It will probably be taught in film schools and other venues far into the future. Bravo, and congratulations, Christopher Nolan!A truly great film....",Tenet
575,actaction,"Big concept, small characters and plot",6,1 September 2020,"The film is heavy on concept, but light on plot and character... it paints in broad strokes, though it has plenty of time to develop both. There are whole sequences where they are shooting at an unnamed military that you never see, it doesn't think it's important enough to show that for some reason. That missing element is a good example of a lot of crudely drawn figures that move in and out of the concept, which barrels toward a likely conclusion without much to get in its own way, thus even though the set pieces are BIG, REAL, SHINEY... the action never gets the pulse going and never raises its own stakes or even proves, in raw emotion, it's promised stakes of preventing WWIII. I saw Inception a week before I saw Tenet, of which I'm a big fan of, mostly because it is so much better at reminding us why the fancy effects and large concept *matters* & always bringing it back to Leonardo DiCaprio's obsession with his wife and the rich man's troubled relationship with his father. In Tenet, you don't know much about the two leading males, know and care a bit about the leading female (just enough to make us like them) & the film's villain seems more suitable for a James Bond film than a complicated sci-fi human driven story. Still, with all this, the beautiful look and technical perfection keeps you watching & the concept keeps making you want to thrill to it... similar to Matrix's bullet effect or Nolan's mind-bending Inception... but the film arrives and ends flat, going through motions, without the possibility of being more. It is better than Intersteller in it as far as something actually happens, not as good as Dunkirk as it manages less character than even that film's short vignettes... but it totally misses its own emotional mark and thus all that is left is a brilliantly crafted concept that holds meaning, but without allowing you to enjoy it viscerally as the trailer promises it will. It means more than it actually is. The experience of seeing it is not amazing, not essential movie-going in theaters (at least I could say Dark Knight Rises was an amazing experience even if it didn't meet the heights of the Dark Knight or Batman Begins before it). The film doesn't completely fail and no doubt the concept is mind blowing enough to do it for a large part of the Nolan audience, and I appreciate that part too (which is why my rating is as high as it is), but if a film can't thrill, with all that technical expertise and smart concept, the film in which fails to execute the concept in human terms ultimately fails. 6 outta 10Following: 6 outta 10

576,filmsploitation,A film you just cant love...,5,27 August 2020,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review:
Tenet has a lot resting on its shoulders. Cinemas have literally been waiting to reopen for it to release. It's a film that HAS to work. That HAS to get people to the cinema. And in that regards it will... a big director with big ideas, a great cast and LOUD. So loud. But as a film Tenet is a strange one. I felt like I was a passenger not a participant - at times dragged along in a story that never cared if you could followed it or not. The thing with Inception was that it was made so well that you always knew what was happening, when and how. Tenet is not that film. You are lost, the action is confusing, the sound mix making most dialogue inaudible, the story makes no sense and it's often spectacle for spectacle's sake. But all that aside it was the films total a lack of heart & warmth that left me cold, not caring and certainly not in a rush to see it again. But please see this on the big screen as at home I fear it will probably make even less sense...Best Bit: The planeCinema, Stream, Avoid: CinemaIf You Liked this Try: Inception, Memento, The Dark Knight",Tenet

583,gdeangel,hot garbage,2,7 October 2020,"It is the eve of the indefinite closure of Regal cinemas, and with the looming obliteration of one of the institutions that saw our homefront through the Great Depression, a World War, and countless other crisis... I scrounged around for an excuse to see a film on the big screen. And it was a choice between Tenet and Hocus Pocus (a film that we project on bed sheets in our neighborhood around Haloween... yeah, not gonna face Covid for that).Anyway, this film is just trash. It's James Bond meets Edge of Tomorrow, only it wasn't born out of a love for cloak-and-dagger international espionage, nor a nerds homage to sci-fi. No, this film was clearly born in the editing room when somebody doing frame by frame reverse playbacks of CGI got the idea of superimposing a reverse reel onto a forward motion reel.It doesn't work. The initial premise is fine -- some simple machines are flowing through time backward. But then the ante just keeps getting up'ed higher and higher so that the earlier stakes kinda seem pointless. And through it all there is a kind of ridiculous ""lets stop saving the world to save the pretty girl"", and then the ""I am doing this for my son"" schlock. Imagine James Bond saying, ""I had to kill him so he wouldn't think he'd won."" No sir. Not professional.20 minutes in to this 3-hour pile of trash, it became clear what makes a Bond film exciting... the thing that brings a tear to the forefront of your eye, or makes you feel like you need to run to the little boys room and tinkle. It's the space between the set-pieces. It's not exactly plot transition. Plot transition is when two main characters have to be show hanging out in a storage container talking so that the audience can be let in on the secret of WFT they are doing. The think I'm talking about is visual and auditory transition. We go from M's office to a wide shot of the Alpine ski resort... or Bond in his Jaguar tearing along a winding road. The audience's eye is traveling with the camera, and there is definitely traveling music announcing your pending arrival somewhere cool.Tenet has none of that. I don't even think there was any music. Just lots of explosions and baritones blasting ""WHOOOOMMMMMMMMM"". Yeah, putting the same spice on every dish is kinda like hitting the same musical note in every scene.Here's another tip to the production team -- don't spray darken your leading actor's beard. His beard is the equivalent of Groucho's eyebrows, only pasted over the entire lower half of his face. If James Bond had a beard, it would not look like this.I sat through this garbage in I-Max. I almost wish I had gone for that tepid looking rom-com, which was the only alternative. So as the curtain falls on my local cinema, all I can do is blame Hollywood. This isn't because people are scared of covid. I see them out at the pickleball courts, not wearing masks -- the senior citizens even. I see them in the restaurants drinking a beer and not social distancing. I see the teachers, afraid to be in a classroom with the kids without plexi-glass cages, milling around in the parking lot running through the daily gossip.

If I wanted to solve a puzzle I would have bought a proper tool. But as I said, you may like it to solve a puzzle movie. And one more thing, do not look for mystery in this movie. nothing like a mysterious concept reveals no matter how much you dig in or watch again. the mystery is the time complexity itself. As I said there is nothing more. As for the scifi aspects, there is only one hint to an algorithm from the future that is making things happening the way you see them. that's all.

588,mayurpanchamia94,Truly Tenet.,8,2 April 2021,"Well, in a single line to put, it's a great and enjoyable film but not as intense and deep as Nolan's other work.Even though I am a adherent fan of Christopher Nolan and his work but this one seems haphazardly made and also with lot of screenplay issues.There are very few movies where if it's plot is complex, difficult to follow and understand because of it's too fast storytelling style but still we get glued in with a genuine interest and excitement without even bothering to look at if any flaws are there or not.The film's plot revolves around reversing the entropy of things and people, resulting in time reversibility. Tenet makes reference to physics concepts including the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, and Feynman and Wheeler's notion of a one-electron universe, but Christopher Nolan stated in the film's press notes: ""we're not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate"".Few scientific concepts which has a base of inspiration in T E N E T are :Epistemology the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge.Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical thermodynamics, where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics, and to the principles of information theory. It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.Objectivity in science is an attempt to uncover truths about the natural world by eliminating personal biases, emotions, and false beliefs. It is often linked to observation as part of the scientific method. It is thus intimately related to the aim of testability and reproducibility. To be considered objective, the results of measurement must be communicated from person to person, and then demonstrated for third parties, as an advance in a collective understanding of the world. Such demonstrable knowledge has ordinarily conferred demonstrable powers of prediction or technology.T-symmetry or time reversal symmetry is the theoretical symmetry of physical laws under the transformation of time reversal.Since the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases as time flows toward the future, in general, the macroscopic universe does not show symmetry under time reversal. In other words, time is said to be non-symmetric, or asymmetric, except for special equilibrium states when the second law of thermodynamics predicts the time symmetry to hold. However, quantum noninvasive measurements are predicted to violate time symmetry even in equilibrium, contrary to their classical counterparts, although this has not yet been experimentally confirmed.Metaphysics the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality.Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are. Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions:
1. What is there?2. What is it like?Entropy predicts that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.The arrow of time, also called time's arrow, is the concept positing the ""one-way direction"" or ""asymmetry"" of time. It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and is an unsolved general physics question.CIA agent, the ""Protagonist"" as they call is played by John David Washington S/O Denzel Washington is impressive and the former footballer does great and riveting action sequences.Robert Pattinson does a real nice job along with Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Michael Caine. Dimple Kapadia seems unnatural to me but again Himesh Patel seemed graced.Hamilton watches are advertised much and same feels for the BMW.The protagonist finally does achieve his mission how and why of the questions has just one answer - Tenent.Don't forget to r e a d the trivia as much truth uncover there.Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His work is permeated by mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. With his wife Emma Thomas.The difference between shooting Following with a group of friends wearing our own clothes and my mum making sandwiches to spending $4 million of somebody else's money on Memento and having a crew of a hundred people is, to this day, by far the biggest leap I've ever made.Nolan (in 2012) on the jump from his first film to his second.If Nolan taught physics none would hate it.Someone rightly pointed out that Nolan's resume is so strong that he need not find the need to mention Interstellar on posters. 😅
Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, ""knowing and respecting that Chris Nolanis one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama.""Nolan uses less of CGI and green screens infact next to none. That also adds value to the movie as most of high budget movies are just computer generated graphics.There's a possibility of sequel too. But no one knows apart from Nolan himself, maybe he should use his time inversal theory and find out.. Haha..Streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Pleasant warning, Don't watch it with popcorn as you will be struck to the movie and popcorn will be left alone.",Tenet

Debicki & Taylor Johnson were good choices but both given very limited scope.We need to be honest; the lead protagonists David Washington can't act, is unconvincing and Patteson looked out of place throughout.
We also have English actors with an American accent and vice versa
and casting Branagh with a phoney Russian accent in 2021 is just a ridiculous cop-out.

What we have when stripped down is nothing more than a B rate rip off of a formulaic 70's James Bond down to the Russian baddies on a yacht in the Mediterranean.

591,ZuhayrRoha,You either love Christopher Nolan movies or live long enough to finally understand & appreciate them,9,31 August 2020,"Nolan is my favourite director and I love him more than any Actor, Franchise or Studio.I wanted to understand this film on deeper level, how Nolan processed it, breaking it down by everybit. But on first watch it was too much to handle, contrary with movies like Inception and Memento: you understand the exposition and continue on with same elements. While over here stuffs still went on, unfolding still happened. I took the 'don't understand, feel it' route for 3rd act. Didn't even know what was going on. Silly me thought they triggered the grandfather paradox.Then I read the wiki plot and a much more in depth plot from a different site, understood it and gave another rewatch within 24hours.As I slowly unrevealled majority of things, I loved it. I understand earlier plot points being established. I adore Memento very much because I like to connect the dots, this was same with much complexity. I spent hours walking and thinking about this film from multiple character's perspective, those small details are what makes this film so much better for me.I am science guy so I love real science being used by filmmakers to help there storytelling, even if impossible science - they stem from real science: entropy, reverse radiation. For Fission, fusion exist... Newtons 3rd law is action:reaction... so entropy might decrease even thou that destroys 2nd law of thermodynamics. I loved the Oxygen-CO2 reverse... friction of tire. I upload daily content about science in movies on Twitter- @science_moviesMasterpiece of action sequence choreography. The amount of work that goes into creating that, sweet. The reverse cinematography was also gold.JDW had class, Robert Pattinson was charming- a bit more character to him would have been great but Nolan lets audience finish the puzzle. Kat was stunning and I thing I needed more her and her son screentime to fully care. KB as villain was great, good but not great motives.At first I thought it was more of point A to point B to C to D with forced action sequence like a bad action film but Nolan is the smartest film maker.Spoilers-
Love the multiple twist this movie had. Didn't expect to see Protagonist vs Protagonist. The Neil twist was heartbreaking and brings full circle to many things. The final twist of Protagonist being the mastermind and he will be doing things 'over and over again' was okay but I have seen similar things on multiple movies: Terminator, 12 Monkeys etc.Watch this film with subtitles, rewatches are mandatory.",Tenet

But what makes tenet so special is just how unique it is compared to say Christopher Nolan's other movies like Dunkirk and the dark knight movies and other movies he has directed because I have to say I haven't seen a movie like this before. What also makes this movie so Great is the cast and I have to say everyone in this movie is fantastic from John David Washington to Robert Pattinson to Elizabeth debicki everyone just kills it in there roles. The action in this movie also is fantastic and super well shot and with the time manipulation concept it helps cause some amazing fights. The music also is just amazing from Tyler Scott's original song the plan to the fantastic score by Ludwig Göransson who obviously takes inspiration from some of the best. The story even though it's not the most original adds some super unique concepts to this movie that sets it apart from other movie and I love that. The villain played by Kenneth Branagh is fantastic and super Threatening. The movie also is super wellshot and looks fantastic. The one problem I have with this movie but it's a very small nitpick is at times it's very hard to tell what the characters are saying because of the audio mix it's a very minor problem that only happened once or twice but it didn't really take me out of the experience.

595,Stewball,The unintended consequence of this chaos may be that it disproves time travel.,6,5 September 2020,"I've been a big fan of Christopher Nolan, especially with his superb efforts like The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. And I've been looking forward to this for almost a year. But my first theater experience since Covid was something of a disappointment due to both conceptual and technical problems that interfered with presenting a coherent story. From the opening sequence in the concert hall (which they never really explain), to problems with understanding the dialogue due to voices being muffled/distorted by gas masks and competing ambient noise, not to mention accents and diction, is a recurring problem throughout the film. Things might be better with headphones, but I suspect not much.The other major problem is how it deals with the idea of time travel or reversal of time. They talk about the grandfather paradox, where someone goes back in time and kills their grandfather, but they never declare how that might be resolved. I think, if the movie accomplishes anything, it shows that such time travel would result in rationally unresolvable chaos-which I guess you could say, the movie portrays pretty will, and perhaps even disproves. Yes, observational travel back in time may well be possible, where all you can do is watch, like replaying a video. But interactive time travel in our 4-D universe is apparently not possible. Taking the grandfather paradox to it's extreme, someone from 10 billion years in the future could figure how to go back in time and cancel the Big Bang....(sigh).It's a stellar cast, with Elizabeth Debicki being a dominant presence in every scene she's in; and Denzel Washington's son, John David, is excellent, especially given that he has the best diction of the lot-something I probably wouldn't normally have noticed.As for plot questions: I never understood the significance of Plutonium 241, or what exactly the role of the woman from India was, except that she was the antagonist to Washington's protagonist.On the positive side, the visuals were as excellent as the audio was garbled. Some of the action sequences worked despite the time-vector confusion, and the scenes with the hydrofoil sailboats was a visual highlight of the film.

597,Dibyayan_Chakravorty,An Average Film With A Challenging Subject,7,22 December 2020,"Handling the topic itself is a great challenge and Nolan and his team have done it nicely. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is a great treat for the eyes. The movie score is pretty bad and the film misses it's golden touch due to Zimmer's absence. At some point I felt the score it too loud to hear the actors' talk.Overall it is an average movie with an extraordinary and challenging subject and I won't count this film among the greatest creations by Nolan, yet it is pretty enjoyable to watch.",Tenet
598,littleging12,Another Nolan Masterpiece,9,24 September 2020,"Tenet is a work of genius. Christopher Nolan delivers again with another heady action blockbuster. Like some of Nolan's previous efforts, Tenet is original and not a sequel, prequel, remake, or book adaptation. The film's story can be described as James Bond meets Inception, or Bond on acid. With new talent at his disposal like John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and musical composer Ludwig Göransson, Nolan proves yet again his mastery of cinema.Nolan continues to create original concepts for each of his films. In Memento, the story unfolded in reverse. In Inception, he had multiple dream layers all moving more slowly in time the deeper the layer. In Interstellar, time was relative to space travel. In Dunkirk, time was disordered and then later reordered at a single climactic moment. In Tenet, characters and objects become inverted and travel backwards in time against objects moving forward. Only Christopher Nolan could come up with concepts so revolutionary and brain busting, only to make all of them work. It is even more astonishing that he makes these remarkable films only two or three years apart from each other.Tenet has Christopher Nolan written all over it. It features a lot of his trademarks like practical effects, gorgeous visuals, a talented ensemble, savvy banter, heady sci-fi themes, heart-pounding action, and an obsession with time. The characters were cool with the standout being Robert Pattinson. Pattinson was witty, stylish, and sophisticated in typical British fashion (he has come a long way since playing an albino vampire). The soundtrack from Ludwig Göransson -- doing his best to mimic Hans Zimmer who's absent due to commitments to Dune -- was epic and exciting. The sound design was loud yet immersive. The pacing was electric with an exciting set piece around every corner. The inversion concept humbles your own intellect. It leaves you in awe that Nolan could concoct such brilliance and make it work cinematically. The action, visuals, and music is a sensation for the eyes and ears, but the inversion is an all new experience for the mind.Tenet also features some of Nolan's worst trademarks like inaudible dialogue, extremely complex narrative structure, and emotional coldness. All of Nolan's films since The Dark Knight Rises muffle dialogue, the worst being in Tenet. Perhaps Nolan does this on purpose to intellectually mess with the audience, and hinder their ability to solve this cinematic Rubik's cube. Or maybe he wants to emphasize the visuals and the music instead of the dialogue. Either way subtitles are a must. To say Tenet is difficult to fully comprehend is a massive understatement. Events unfolding in reverse while action unfolds in real time is a brain buster in itself. Tenet wastes no time and spends much of the infrequent downtime explaining the plot or the physics of inversion. Many of Nolan's previous efforts are difficult to fully grasp after first viewing, which only increases the likelihood of watching the film again. Nolan's films are highly rewatchable thanks to this complexity, and of course the spectacle. In defense of this film being too difficult to follow, the scientist girl from the beginning said it best, ""Don't try to understand it, just feel it."" The spectacle and the theatricality feel incredible, yet is there an emotional core? There is attempted emotion, but most people do not go to see Tenet for the character relationships, and emotional catharsis. In defense of the film feeling emotionally empty, most films probably feel this way to people. All of Stanley Kubrick's films are emotionally cold. Nolan likes to stir our imaginations, our brains, and our adrenaline glands, not so much our hearts.Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time because with each film he makes he manages to thrill his audience with surface level action and drama, as well as layer each of his films with meaning and depth. There is always something new to pick up on after each viewing. Nolan combines the best elements of art house and commercial films to create the best kinds of films. Essentially, he combines the depth and intelligence of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the entertainment value of Star Wars. Tenet is another welcomed addition to this breed of artistic entertainment.",Tenet

601,matt_hew,Temporal Soup.,4,10 May 2021,"So...
The actors and crew didn't understand it (JDW is 'still learning'about it).Post production didn't understand it (as Nolan has joked about).The majority of critics and the audience didn't understand it.So...
The general consensus is that you will have to watch the 2 1/2 hour movie multiple times before you will be able to understand it.So... why bother?Or at the very least what is the point in going to the cinema to see it as it will be a waste of time if you're going to have to watch it again? Surely shouldn't the filmmakers consider this for their audience and for the films success or does that not matter?The film does try to explain itself along the way usually by having a 20min action scene followed by a 20min lecture of what has happened which seems to be repeated throughout. 'Two people attacked us. No, it was the same person using a turnstile - Now here's the lecture about turnstiles...'It just gets annoying and pedantic. And this is before making any comments about the wooden acting of John David Washington, Kenneth Branagh being a stereotypical British bad guy impersonating a Russian crime boss or the dreadful audio throughout.What's also interesting is that those who have persevered in a quest to understand it have just found more and more plot holes as to why the premise doesn't work that you're better off watching it and leaving in a state of confusion!If only Christopher Nolan had some way of going back in time to contact his former self before he started work on this temporal soup of a movie!",Tenet
602,SureCommaNot,Work of art,9,1 September 2020,"Nolan's films are works of art, meant for multiple viewings, and I appreciate that about him. (He directed my favorite film, Memento, and films like Inception and The Dark Knight are high on the list, too.)I didn't find the time-chronology elements confusing, because I'm already accustomed to thinking that way. What was harder for me were the political and interpersonal interweavings, but you see the same sort of thing in many political action dramas. Just leaves room for plenty of rewatchings!Bold move, making the main character nameless, so you care much less about him than a Cobb or a Leonard Shelby, but I think this helped keep the film more abstract.

Now, that might be true...but I've got other films on my list and (maybe I'm mad but) I like to understand a film first time round.I dont mind getting a greater understanding on a second watch, or picking up a few hidden details. But if an ubergeek like me was struggling with central points of the plot, then I suspect a large portion of the audience is going to be very unsatisfied indeed.My non ubergeek missus was definitely left very unsatisfied (trust me, I know that look anywhere...I've seen it often enough).In summation, it appears Christopher Nolan has made a visually great film with interesting concepts...but he's made it too smart for it's own good and to its own detriment.",Tenet
604,LiamCullen6,"Stressful, Confusing, and Utterly Frustrating",7,26 August 2020,"The year is 2020. Coronavirus has taken over. Lockdowns and quarantines have been imposed worldwide. Masks are essential. Cinemas have been closed for months, and - for many - TENET marks the big blockbuster which signals the opening of cinemas again in many countries, and perhaps a return to some sort of (new) normal.I believe many moviegoers will, like myself, enter the cinema feeling so excited and yearning a new Nolan movie, and will leave feeling rather deflated and disappointed.I went to the cinema to see this with a friend today (in IMAX), and both he and I (not to toot our own horns) would like to believe we are (at least mildly) intelligent. We are cinephiles and thoroughly enjoy our cinema visits, and are careful in which movies we select to see on the big screen.Unfortunately, given the utter perplexion this movie bestows upon its audience, this leads to a displeasing dichotomy: either we are not as intelligent as we thought, or this movie isn't as well-written as Nolan's other movies. Both conclusions are equally terrifying to us (nerds).About just over an hour after the movie begins is when things start to dissolve. At this point, I began thinking: ""Gosh, I wish I could start the movie over again, but with subtitles on this time."" And I felt that way for the entire rest of the film. There's many moments where I had to turn to my friend and mouth the words: ""What did (s)he just say?"", only to be met with repeated shrugs. The movie is 2.5 hours long, yet everything is incredibly fast-paced (to the point it has poor pacing); if you blink, you'll likely miss something very important.Maybe it's my fault - maybe I briefly, for a few critical moments, let my attention slip, and therefore I'm to blame for my own confusion. Maybe this is another Nolan instant-classic, but unfortunately I'm not sure that's the case (for context, many didn't like Dunkirk for a number of reasons - I loved it, for many other reasons). I'd love to get into detail as to some of the specifics which truly baffled me in the second half of the film, but as I want this to remain a spoiler-free review, I won't delve in.And, for the avoidance of doubt: the action set-pieces, the soundtrack, and the cinematography were all phenomenal. Just not really too sure the plot was quite up to standard, or necessarily well-executed. It was almost like a bad Bond movie, with a sup-par villain and a random Bond girl we're supposed to care about, but don't because... well, we just don't, and I think the script/dialogue is largely to blame for these characters we feel apathy towards.I do hope if you're reading this and you do decide to go see it, that you understand it better than I did. I will rewatch it at some point, but I certainly won't be paying to see it a second time in the cinema! I'd rather not pay good money to be put in a bad mood. If I wanted that, I'd go do some mathematical equations.And finally, for those saying this is a movie you have to go see twice - I don't doubt that that's true. But I don't think it's fair to expect an audience to be disappointed in a movie and only appreciate it on second viewing. Inception, Memento and Interstellar were clever films too, but you were able to follow them and didn't need to see them twice to enjoy them.",Tenet
605,kelvynchin,Over complicated and confusing.,6,30 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan's grand blockbuster arrives in multiplexes during Covid 19 to much anticipation. However, as far as critics go, I think the Guardian's Catherine Shoard got it right - it's a bit of a dud. Most guys will find this movie awesome - it is like a tinkly bling Mercedes with gull doors, but ladies might dislike it's deliberate intellectual posturing.Never has such an obviously fantastic looking film been so intent on sabotaging itself. I think Mr Nolan has to remember that in the end, such movies have to be entertaining. So we have the first half of the film, which is a fantastic nod to a Bond movie - it's gloriously and excitingly done - suddenly morph in the second half of the film into something like Back to the Future part III , but without all the excitement or humour. People move forward while everything else moves backward. There are large scale action sequences where half of the people are shooting bullets (going forward in time), while another half of the people are catching bullets (inverted in time), ALL THE WHILE with the background objects in the scene moving BACKWARDS in time. I have also been having an issue with Nolan's big actions sequences - since Inception. Scenes of people running around shooting at each other become repetitive and lacks coherence. Its just not exciting - compared to the final battle in ""The Outpost"", as an example. But the final action sequences in Tenet, although obviously handsomely and impressively mounted, is a dead bore. Mainly because we're trying to figure out who the hell are going back or forward in time (made worse by the fact that everyone is wearing combat fatigues). I also have issue with Nolan purposely filming key conversations in a deliberately undecipherable manner (lots of fury and background noises). A key conversation between the hero and the villain is shouted out above the roar of wind and waves on a speeding catamaran, for example. Why would you do that? I can't hear!! Again, maybe that's the point.I think the director needs to remember that these kinds of movies need to be exciting. And it can't be exciting if the audience is scratching their heads for most of the climax of the film. Telling your audience to ""don't understand it, just feel it"" is fine, but I just didn't get the excitement. I was just sitting there trying to figure out who is going forward or backward in time.This is not to say Tenet is a bad film. Far from it, technical execution is virtuosic in complexity (all the backward forwards action is used to amazing effect in several gunfights and especially a superb car chase), John David Washington is unflappably suave (just like a Black James Bond) and Robert Pattinson has morphed into a charismatic performer, a far cry from his Twilight days. I just felt that the time bending narrative is just overdone, and it kind of spoilt the show.",Tenet
606,rklemm05,Nolan's recurring problem,4,23 December 2020,"At least to me, looks like Christopher Nolan once again fixates on a concept and then tries and make up a story that matches it, instead of having it the other way around.Memento (which is my favorite to date) was: ""let's tell a story in reverse order""
Inception was: ""let's tell a story that happens in a dream within a dream within a dream"".
Tenet is: ""let's tell a story that goes backwards and forward at the same time"".Problem with this method is that the concept should be serving the plot, not replace it or be the plot itself. Having an original story-telling form is great, but if it's at the content's expense, it's a no-go.Memento was great at both: the story's unfolding was great, the narrative option taken was remarkable. Inception was a little far-fetched for me. Tenet takes the cake, it is so convoluted that I'm not even sure that Nolan himself could keep track of what happens all the time.JD Washington's performance is so disappointing, he seems as lost as I am in the middle of all this, and that's saying something.",Tenet

I understood it, for the most part, on one viewing. There were a few parts I had not quite figured out. But. A second viewing remedied that. As far as the audio goes. I had no issue in my theater. Watched in a Dolby atmos. And everything was fine. I guess a lot of people are used to playing on their phones while watching, since movies like the avengers don't need any brain cells to understand.

After the reveal (if one can say that) this film requires a second viewing for those who are Nolan fans or fixated in science fiction about time travel .

Overall, I found the film underwhelming in the end.Other reviewers mentioned the characters were like cardboard cutouts. I don't disagree with this sentiment. The protagonist, Kat and Neil were there in the service of the main conceit of the film, time travel and its ramifications. A film that isn't character driven should have better backstory/dialogue than this, however. As an aside, Pattinson was very good in the film. That was a welcome surprise.After Inception and Memento, I should have expected something like this. Not a film like the Batman trilogy with Christian Bale. According to two talking heads on network television, this film ""underperformed"" at the box office. During the worst pandemic in 100 years, that was bound to happen.I expect Chris Nolan to be up to his not so old tricks in the not too distant future.

I have watched this movie Twice the first time 5/10
1.What is let down by the film is that doesn't explain when you are inverted and go backwards in time for a week a year etc.When you come back to your normal time, there are 2 of you and your re living the same time forward as you went back! Understand
2.So this creates an inverted one of you , a non-inverted you and you in your normal timeline.
So that's 3 versions of you understand?
3.This what makes Tenet a hard to follow movie
as what your watching already happen, as the end you could say is the beginning.
4.Another thing that makes no sense is the bad guy ( You see his been basically paid to destroy the world in his time) that's why he is so powerful and rich.As he's been paid in gold
5.The reason why the future wants to kill the world in the past , is to fix it in the future.
6. Example if you go back in time and kill your grandfather (Would you seek to exist or not) but if you didn't exist how would you go back in the first place?
7.Here we have a paradox, everything has already happened and your watching it un-fold, in only one type of prospective the main character that he doesn't completely understand.
8.Certain things in this movie is very well done yet fails, the actual twist is (Robert Paterson) has been inverted , he's seen the whole thing backwards and forwards and in one time line.
9.I hope this makes a little more sense as the weapons that are inverted is another story.",Tenet
619,darklydreamingrahu,"Not Necessary to Watch Twice, but....",9,29 December 2020,"You may need subtitles. It depends on your system and setup.Like most Nolan films (Dark Knight, Interstellar), the music and some of the effects are noticeably overbearing. Tenet is definitely the worst offender of this yet.And, that's a shame, since a ton of exposition and explanation is given through dialogue (another Nolan staple).That said, Tenet is a unique sci-spy thriller that has some interesting concepts and mind-blowing visuals.Just to put an extra touch on the visuals, Tenet REALLY has some cool eye-candy.It's a concept film through and through. Some people are gonna like that, some people aren't.There's some good acting here. Spy dialogue is delivered with the perfect amount of intrigue and fluidity to mostly hold your attention, if you're willing.That's the crux of Tenet. It's time travel. Some people are instantly going to nope out of it. Its interesting visual presentation but lack of cohesive structure will divide fans.I think it's a film that is technically exceptional, but it lacks the mainstream appeal of some of the director's previous works. This is for a niche audience, but for that audience, it's a no-brainer.If you like films such as Looper, Edge of Tomorrow, Timecrimes, or other time-travel related action cinema, then you'll probably enjoy Tenet.Provided, of course, that you can hear the damn thing and that you're awake enough to not miss one of its many subtly revelatory scenes.I liked it though.8.5/10",Tenet
620,creator301,Straight up insulting.,1,1 September 2020,"For Nolan this movie is horrendous. A syfy original but from the 80s without the cool action to make up for the lack of sense and script. Heartbreaking waste of a fantastic cast and cinematography. Budget must have also been huge but shamefully wasted. If you can't predict what's going to happen in this movie you've never seen a movie before, and this movie is not appropriate for younglings like this. Fake reviews are worse than ever unfortunately and I'm fully convinced Hollywood has been ruined. Its sad in this case because we havent seen a big budget film from a promising director like this in a few years and he just destroyed his own project. We see the events occurring from the forward moving timeline and anyone paying attention will understand. The second half of the movie simply replays this, wasting hours of possibly fun time travel stuff. Garbage Nolan. You fanboys need to quit it with you need to watch it twice. If you try pulling that on actual movie fans theyre going to laugh at you as if youre a sidewalk screamer. Get over it, its just a bad movie.",Tenet
621,huntersmithx,"Nolan's new time-travel (but not) thriller is style over substance, but impossible to repel.",8,1 September 2020,"There's a ballfield of opinions on director Christopher Nolan, one of the most honored working today and especially for his unapologetic ambitions and unconventional storytelling: Those that think everything up to Inception is the end of the line in terms of quality, those that believe everything up to The Dark Knight Rises is it, those that love everything he does regardless of how good it is, those that only appreciate his individual films or early prospects, those that think he's overrated to terrible, so and so forth. I've been prodigiously impressed by most of his films to date, even his lower efforts Insomnia and Following that are still prestinely made. Tenet falls into the latter category right between those two just mentioned; style over substance, maddening, but you can't take your eyes off of it.The Protagonist, played by John David Washington of recent Blackkklansman fame, is the mirror of the audience in this journey of preventing a nuclear holocaust and navigating through a wave of international espionage to do so. With the territory comes the fact that his backstory isn't elaborated on as much; he doesn't have time to reflect on his life or past memories, but the mission and his strive to do good keeps us engaged. John's performance is strong for what he has to work with, body-language driven but also witty and shrewdly tuned. He of course doesn't hold a candle to most of Nolan's other heroes- Interstellar's Joseph Coop and by extension his wonderful daughter Murph, Inception's Dom Cobb, Bruce Wayne/Batman and even Leonard Shelby. Robert Pattinson is irresistible as Protagonist's partner Neil, determined as all hell but also funny. Nolan's regular acting confidante Michael Caine has a small but important role, his most notable scene is imbedded with some British humor (contrary to the IndieWire review that labeled this film ""humorless""; seriously, would you use that in a criticism of a Scorsese or Malick movie?). Kenneth Branaugh gives it his all as the antagonist Andrei Sator, whose sinister presence and bits of backstory are thankfully given time to shine. Like our hero though, he doesn't shine as much to Nolan's other excellent villains who have much more character, and his motives are somewhat unintelligible. The best performance is Elizabeth Debicki's Kat, who in some ways being the deuteragonist is an emotionally resonant balance to John David Washington. She needs to be rescued at times, but nonetheless has plenty to do and contributes in battling the main threat to the preservation of humanity. Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia and Aaron Taylor-Johnson also have notable presences, though nothing too much comes of them except for Aaron's towards the end.With Nolan breaking his tradition of usual cinematic reference points for this film, instead this plays somewhat like a Christopher Nolan's Greatest Hits Collection, as somewhat suggested by the second theatrical trailer. There's dating back to the timeline breaking mechanics of Memento, good vs evil in an elaborate and constantly shifting world like in The Dark Knight Trilogy (and another terrifically staged plane crash sequence to add), and of course Inception. This is visually astonishing and dense; if repeat viewings become your gig with this, then I bet there will be many things to gaze at in the time inversion sequences. It makes for some breathtaking action and fighting set-pieces, the sound design adds to how hard the punches are felt and the practicality; including an astonishing battlefield sequence. The score by Ludwig Goransson continues Nolan's usual streak with his composers, (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception and Interstellar being the best for my money).If you thought that some of his other films like Inception were too complicated, then you'll probably not enjoy this, which makes everything else that came before for Nolan seem like a day at the office. I don't know yet how it will shape in his filmography, but this is by far one that's probably the hardest to grasp. I never had an issue understanding his films nor their sound, even with the enhancements from IMAX technology, but Tenet is the exception to that because a good amount of the dialogue and scenes were hard to follow with the pouncing score and sound design. I hope that he'll improve on this in his next project if he decides to continue this hail mary experiment.Given the current state of the theater business and how much our culture is shifting, a good getaway to the movies is just what many have been wishing for. Tenet might not be the one we deserve, but the one that's needed. Perplexing and worthy of his slate despite being a lesser outing.Grade- B/3 out of 4 stars.",Tenet

Sound design is so bad it's hard to hear the campy dialogue over the music.This is exactly how high concept movies should not be. As a viewer you don't care about the actors because they don't generate any excitement or thrills. They are just like robots.",Tenet

But when you understand it you realize that it doesn't make sense.
Usually love Nolan's movies, but this one was trying too hard to be ""smart"" movie. Ideas were cool, actors are great, but couldn't fit an sense into this.Plus in this movie all the time when you try to catch it's hard plot, you don't have time to just enjoy it.",Tenet

I get the intention of the movie, but it just didn't persuede me. The characters all lacked a likable personality, the story was grey and dull and I think, that if you'd remove all the diffusion and timeplay, the acting wasn't that great either.There's a small part in me that has lost ""movielove"" because of the current hype in movies and I don't really ""connect"" anymore with most of the modern day actors, so that might be at play here.",Tenet
626,bethlori,C. Nolan's most confusing movie yet!!!,7,18 April 2021,So... I just watched this for the second time still enjoy it only the good quality of the movie I enjoy not the dialogue.. like we live in a twilight world no friends at dusk??? What the ????? It's like Nolan is making us strain our minds to understand like Inception half of us understands it and the other half not so much please Nolan just go back to making simple plots like insomnia did or momento did!!! Not about confusing time travel and weird dialogue!!! So nerds if you like Nolan go watch momento or inception or Batman begins!! Goodbye nerds!!!!,Tenet
627,Liam3011,Christopher Nolan Does it Again!,9,23 September 2020,"I understand some people have been left confused or disappointed with this movie. I'm not one of them.Honestly? I had little idea what this movie was about going into it. All I really knew was that it was, and I quote, ""Bond on Acid"" and that it dealt with reversing time. That's really about it. However, there's much more to this movie than what meets the eye from the trailers.Is it loud? Yes. Very loud. (In fact, I jumped out of my seat within the first few minutes). Does it require a second viewing? Most likely because of that fact alone. Even though I understood it, I still feel like there were things I missed. But that isn't so say my first viewing wasn't extraordinary. This movie had me on edge at times; I was incredibly invested. The action was loud, fast and intense throughout. ""The Protagonist"", while we're not given his name (marked for spoilers for that reason alone), was incredibly charismatic and pretty funny at times. The use of the ""inversion"" was incredibly clever and made for some awesome action sequences.Typical Christopher Nolan, things tie into each other. Except with this movie, everything you see ties into each other. That is just incredible on it's own. Every event in this movie means something; everything that happens is an event that matters. Nothing is really just there to extend the runtime.The performances are great. John David Washington is great; Robert Pattinson is definitely a great actor. Everyone in this movie delivers an awe-inspiring performance, with intense drama and action and witty comedy at times. And I love it!The score, despite it not being Hans Zimmer (which is rare for Nolan nowadays), is incredible. Really sets the scene. And if my hearing is right, when the reverse portion of specific scenes are shown, the same score is played in reverse. Nice touch!Last but not least, the climax of the movie is incredible. The cinematography throughout the movie is incredible, but here it is second to none. The use of effects, sound, shots, the lot. It's simply incredible.Honestly, the only gripes I have with this movie are that the audio can be a bit too loud for it's own good in certain scenes. That or, depending on the scene, speech can seem a little muffled. On top of that, it's incredibly complex. Not confusing, but complex, so for some it probably won't be for them. But all in all? Fantastic cinematic masterpiece that requires your attention if you're willing to give it your time.And to wrap this off. No. It is not ""Bond on Acid"". It's ""Nolan on Acid"".Well done, Christopher Nolan. You've done it once again.",Tenet
628,UncleTantra,"""Tenet"" -- the Christopher Nolan is a total dick review",2,9 September 2020,"I just finished watching Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet."" Color me not impressed. If you want my honest opinion, the film strikes me as a monumental 300-million-dollar ego trip, one that may have even been intentionally designed to kill its audiences.I mean, think about it. The film's villain, Sator, knows that he's dying, so he engineers a multi-temporal plot to use future tech to take everyone else on the planet with him. This villain, played by Kenneth Branagh, is so warped and humorless that he's actually looking forward to this.Now think about the film itself. It's two and a half hours of utter humorlessness, so confusing that it almost *requires* multiple viewings, just to figure out WTF is going on. So what does Christopher Nolan DO with this film, when he finally finishes it? He releases it *only* in theaters. During a pandemic. To audiences who are going to find it so confusing that they'll have to go *back* to those theaters over and over to figure it out, in the process potentially exposing themselves to a fatal virus every time they do.I'm tempted to think that in the five years it purportedly took Nolan to complete this movie, he turned into his own villain, and is now consciously or subconsciously trying to kill his own audiences, while ensuring that they have as little fun watching the movie as humanly possible.That's my theory, and I'm stickin' with it. 🙂I *get* it. The dude loves James Bond movies. He's been wanting for years to make his own. But, being the egomaniac he is, he couldn't be content with just making an everyday James Bond movie. Noooooo. He had to make one that would make people think, ""My, how clever Christopher Nolan is."" So he made the film as *serious* and as twisty-turny and as incomprehensible as he possibly could.Color me not impressed by how clever he is. Sure, the action scenes are neat, almost all of them done in real life and in real time, as opposed to with CGI. And sure, the film is *almost* worth watching just for the opportunity to see 6'2"" Elizabeth Debicki walk across the screen in high heels. 🙂 But now that it's over, I find myself thinking not about how clever Christopher Nolan is, but about what a total dick he is.I mean, what's up with creating a film that almost requires Cliff Notes to explain it, and that is no fun even *when* you understand it, and then on top of that forcing audiences to go to a theater during a pandemic to see it, and thus possibly die? I'm telling you...total dick.Makes me glad I pirated the film and watched it at home. That way I get to live, write bad reviews like this one, distribute them widely, and possibly keep a few people from seeing it, thus keeping them alive.Heck, the way I see it, I'm more of a James Bond hero than Nolan's protagonist is. 🙂",Tenet

No way to casually watch it, you really need to pay attention or you will get lost in a hurry.

Every Nolan Movie Is different, Fresh & Unique but this time tenet movie is a average movie for me. Because this movie has many fall and sometimes you feel during watching the movie this is not good. Which we do not expect from Nolan's films. because this movie plot very simple but so many confusion.The general plot is comprehensible enough to enjoy the movie, try to dig a bit deeper into all the intricacies and you'll probably lose yourself really fast. The movie's premise is actually interesting, but at some points it gets a bit tiring trying to connect all the dots. Nolan's movies tend to think they're smarter then they really are (a big problem I had with interstellar), and this one suffers from the same problem, but 2.5 hours passed relatively fast, I can't say i didn't have fun watching it, however i don't plan on rewatching it. good.
That's Why My Rating: 7/10",Tenet

While lockdown may have warped people's perception of time, nothing can quite prepare you for the brain-addling time distortion on display in Christopher Nolan's latest feature Tenet.From its heart racing opening to its dual-timeline finale, Nolan pushes the boundaries of how film is presented and meant to be consumed. Playing fast and loose with chronology, Tenet is built like a puzzle with a story that folds over itself enough times to make you believe the screenplay was built from origami. Put simply, the film demands numerous viewings to untangle its interwoven narrative and will undoubtably attract a myriad of interpretations.Tenet also arrives at a time where cinemas are facing an uphill battle attracting audiences as they begin to reopen around the world. Luckily, Nolan has never been one to compromise the ambition of his films by doing things by half-measures. With its operatically staged action sequences and Ludwig Goransson's pulsating soundtrack, Tenet is a complete sensory overload that offers a cinematic experience not to be missed.",Tenet
632,jared79,Not as hard to follow as some say.,8,11 April 2021,"Sure, I will need a second viewing, but it wasn't that hard to follow in general and by the end, it all falls into place.Movies about time travel will always confuse people because that's the premise of time travel, it's confusing. I won't call you stupid if you can't follow it. These things take an IQ greater than the average human, so it's not your fault if you don't understand, it's genetic.Anyway, good movie if you concentrate, action is good and the the reverse stuff is great.Soundtrack wasn't too loud like people said, but I didn't watch it in the cinemas because, you know COVID, so maybe they fixed it for home viewing.Is it as good as Inception? No. But it's still good. I like a mind bending movie and Nolan knows how to make them.",Tenet
633,pm_unnikrishnan,The premise is nonsensical. Nolan is milking his market value.,2,1 September 2020,"Too bad that Nolan is just milking the stuff he is famous for. Being confusing. We have this totally nonsensical premise of reversing entropy being shown in it. If you think for a few seconds about the concept being shown, you'll see that it's stupid. It can't really happen in that movie's universe. They're contradicting their own internal logic. But it has become like the Emperor's new clothes.The stunts and action scenes were kind of good. But not so great. Some scenes with the reverse action scenes were interesting to watch but they couldn't sustain that intrigue. Seeing one such fight scene was enough. They have overdone it.
Music too was good. That was the only thing telling the viewers the supposed importance of some scenes I guess. Without the compelling music, more people would've seen the bluff.They've added that mandatory female character who is supposed to get all the sympathies from the viewers. As if the nonsensical premise was not enough. In Inception we have the dead wife in memory form. In Memento, it all revolves around him going for revenge as they killed his wife. In Interstellar, it's the daughter. They don't even acknowledge the son's presence. Why does Nolan have to have such a female character with all those family emotions added to it? The world is going to end in Tenet and are we supposed to care about this woman and the son whom she loves? They don't even show that son I guess. And the villain behaving badly to her doesn't evoke sympathy at all.
As for acting, John David Washington is not so great. Barely does what he is supposed to do. Robert Pattinson is good. As is Elizabeth Debicki. Kenneth Branagh too is very good. Aaron-Taylor Johnson delivers, unlike the last time, when he played an army guy in Godzilla.Due to the stupid and pretentious premise, the whole movie becomes a pain to watch. Should've at least made a few cuts to make it bearable. This is just him throwing crap at us knowing very well that disliking his films would make one look stupid in others' eyes. Skip this one. He reached his highest point in Inception. Haven't really topped that one later.",Tenet

636,actualbookworm,"""Tenet""",9,20 December 2020,"This is another mind-boggling and time-bending film by Christopher Nolan. Relatively speaking, this movie has a more difficult plot than what ""Inception"" has. It's like watching the German series, ""Dark"" that you need to pay close attention to every single detail. Nonetheless, this film is terrific. It has beautiful, new shots that we've never seen in other movies before and great fighting sequences. This film is like a person dressed up in a nice and sleek suit. When it comes to characterization, the protagonist is very charismatic and likeable. At first, I thought that this movie didn't have a lot of emotions, which was fine in a Christopher Nolan movie because most of his films focus on the bigger picture. But in the end when everything was revealed, the connection between John David Washington's character and Robert Pattinson's character kinda tugged my heartstrings a bit, so that was nice. I hope this movie gets more buzz because it's definitely worth a watch.",Tenet
637,michaelxqh,Nolan Missed,5,23 December 2020,"Five stars literally isn't a high score especially for Christopher Nolan. I think the piece was trying to mimic Inception, but spending too much paragraph describing the abstract technique of inversion equals to the requirement for the audience to figure out what happened, to the characters and the world in the story. Loss of motivation, few display of ordinary perspective, fast but confusing scenes, made me lose interests of the plot, but watching it as an action movie. Second time going over, the puzzling storyline seems to be fathomable, but there're still places unclear and needs imagination. Positively, the special effects were cool enough to catch my eyes for the first time(2 stars), music was brainwashing(2 stars for Ludwig Goransson the awesome composer), and Neil's sacrifice was really touching at the end (1 star). The movie has lot to explore and analyze, but I'll leave it to fans who are interested.",Tenet

But after ""Tenet"", I thought about the movie nearly 24/7 for a whole week and I immediately wanted to watch it again. And this is what a great movie have to make me feel. I want to use my brain, analyse the plot, watching videos about ist and going to the cinema again only a few days later. And ""Tenet"" did that to me. If I don't want to think a lot, I watch a good comedy or romance, having a nice time watching it and when it ends I'm happy and it's over. But not with a Christopher Nolan Film.

639,m0rg16,Peak Nolan - and not in a good way,5,30 August 2020,"This feels like the epitome of what a Nolan-movie is. It's stylish, action-packed, inventive and epic. However the other side of that coin is that it's also drab, unengaging, contrived and too long for it's own best.The film is built around one quite clever idea of time travel which is then used to throw our characters from one inventive action-scene to the next. A lot of the film is explained through dialogue - in fact almost all of the dialogue is just exposition - and functions as a way to set up the next action scene. Too bad that the film is also so confusing that the action scenes themselves have almost no tension to them whatsoever. It's never really clear why the bad guys are doing what they're doing - or why it's bad. Or who they are. Our protagonist is just fighting a gimmick (sometimes with a gimmick of his own).Zero emotion, except for maybe thrills in some scenes.

Laws of physics (or magic) created by writers are beyond reproach no matter how crazy or how chaotic the movie is. However, such laws have to consistent and can't excuse plot holes. Now, Tenet has no blatant contradictions or plot holes. It's more like a PoA level (where time travel was pretty OK but the plot had a bootstrap paradox problem at the end). Tenet is way more chaotic so it's harder to pick apart, especially from watching in a theater. Still, the plot-line does have some weak points where the story is forced into a certain scene just so the movie can have those cool scenes (insert spoilers here). The same with characters - some of them are overrated by the story just for the sake of diversity and there don't seem to be much rationale why or how have they gotten involved with Tenet (insert spoilers here).Rating: 6.5 (rounded up)",Tenet

I think that the storyline needed more improvements, it is not easy to deal with inverse actions inside real world, so it could have been better with more planning.",Tenet
645,ingmarbeldman-753-927212,"great idea, wrong genre and execusion",5,9 September 2020,"Nolan is using the wrong genre. He needs - as he always does - a drama or action-drama to establish his complicated theme's properly. A drama has a slower paste, which gives the viewer the opportunity to follow the difficult theories he wants to discuss and get familiar with them to enjoy the story. It's about information-provision.
Nolan does that very well in Inception and Interstellar. He uses various tricks for this, so that the information provision is in balance. But with Tenet he chooses action and action, my goodness, it is! Problem: as a viewer I am not carefully introduced into a world that I do not understand, but I am immersed in it in the first 20 minutes and I have to believe the arena he wants me to, without understanding it.
My brain boils over and it stays that way for the rest of the movie; I do not get it. Mission failed.Secondly, the theme - the relativity of time (and space) - is not reflected in the very framework of the script. I just get a linear story (which is a curse in a film over the relativity of time, right?:-))). But worse, the story is an ordinairy Hollywood-formula, hence predictable and cliché (hero finds problem and goes from A to B to C through various action sequences and then we go into the belly of the beast with a lot of guns). Consequence? Tenet is a B-movie with just some unclear circumstances that don't affect my understanding.This is rounded off by my third point of criticism: the acting is mediocre and the bad guy - Sator -, like his wife, is not worked out clearly in the script at all; i don't see clear needs and aim's. Besides, what is suggested as an extremely mysterious figure - for which our hero even has to bungee jump to get through - suddenly turns out to be a sad man on a boat and a suicidal tendency. At the very end, he also babbles something about his concern for the climate. People from the future choose, of all there is of living creatures......him????? Come on, Christoffer! Sator is a joke - with joke-rhetoric . His character is supposed to be the gateway to a mystery. With a joker like that the mystery is a joke too.Tenet is unworthy of Nolan and hopefully his only blunder. But everyone - especially a talent like Nolan - is entitled to a slip.",Tenet
646,Victor_Fallon,I enjoyed the croutons that came with this awful soup.,4,1 September 2020,"Visually it is occassionally spectacular, with some truly exceptional techniques on display that are worthy of praise. Everything else is the usual Nolan fare, ie. not very good.The characters are uninteresting, the script is a bloated chore (endlessly over-explaning it's exceedingly simple premise, similar to Inception) and the sound mixing is shamefully amateurish. All of Nolan's films have terrible sound production, but this is by far and away his most egregious example. This man really needs to get his hearing checked, or employ somebody who knows what high-pass filter does.The soundtrack is ok (I think?) - there are flashes of creativity here and there, but they are unfortunately swamped by the aforementioned mix. The production design is decent, with quality sets and excellent lighting/camerawork, so definitely worth seeing if you're into cinematography as a craft. It's just that all of the other elements let it down.I've seen all of Nolan's films once and never felt compelled to return to them. This fits neatly into that trend.",Tenet
647,shawthingproductions,Big Nolan fan but this is a no from me.,2,26 August 2020,"Spoiler-freeThe editing is confusing in places. One minute we are in one area and the next, the same character is in another area. Now this isn't part of the inversion process but just a general cut from one place to another but it was done so jarringly it felt as though it was thrown together quickly to reach a deadline.The plot is all over the place with a lot of loopholes but I guess the whole thing can be explained by saying ""Paradox"" a few more times.The acting is nothing special. In fact in some places I really struggled to hear what was being said because of a sudden loud piece of music drowning out the actor's one line. Again, was it thrown together? A decent sound mixer / composer would have avoided this issue.The action is ""meh"". Yes there are some cool inverted scenes but not enough to warrant the long run-time and at the end with most people in full riot gear, I really struggled to tell who was who and, more to the point, to care about any of them.More annoying is the film follows this pattern:1. do something cool.
2. explain how
3. talk about doing something cool
4. explain how
5. explain again for the people at the back
6. do something cool
7. explain what happened just in case people still aren't following.
8. explain again.
9. talk about doing something cool...It's the same process from start to start and, quite frankly, it is boring and that is something I never thought I would say. Inception was mesmerising from start to finish but this is misfire after misfire.Christopher Nolan thinks he is a clever filmmaker but, in this instance, he has just tried too hard.",Tenet
648,greg-goremykin,Too complex for its own good,7,3 December 2020,"I'm definitely a Christopher Nolan fanboy, ""The Prestige"" is my 2nd favourite film of all time (after ""Brazil""), and I've loved all his films on multiple levels, that is, until this one.It has all the makings of a great Nolan film, all the ingredients, but the story is so narratively ambitious that it forces way too much of the dialogue in exposition trying to explain itself. Any movie I've seen that falls into this trap messes with my suspension of disbelief because a story that is mainly about explaining itself is the very opposite of realism.Along with this, the characters become more like the chorus of a Greek play and much harder to be engaged by emotionally, and if that doesn't happen it's darn near impossible to care about the characters or what happens to them, leading to disengagement from the film altogether.I would still call this a brilliant and exceptional film, and I love undoing the straps of puzzles Nolan builds around his big reveal of his films generally, but again this story was just too ambitious for my mind to keep up with, or maybe I wasn't compelled or persuaded enough to bother. Again, overly-talky pictures that spend out of necessity not just a large portion, but the majority of the dialogue explaining what is going on is very 1980s primetime soap-opera-ish.I can see where a very good idea for a story, just a kernel, could be build upon and only when so much time and craft have been invested does a fatal flaw emerge, and dialogue is a handy tool for trying to paper over those fatal flaws, but we sacrifice getting to know characters as a result.One thing ""Tenet"" did for me was show me how quickly and organically I made emotional attachments to characters in other Nolan films, all without much set up as far as personal history or background or the other tools used to draw a viewer to being invested what happens to them. In the aforementioned ""The Prestige"" I felt bonds and understands with each of the characters very quickly in a way I just try as I might could not with the characters in this film.And as another point of comparison, ""The Prestige"" held a great mystery with all the clues available right to the end as to whether it was primarily a period piece about rivalry and envy, or a fantasy film. With that film Nolan trusted the audience enough to be able to follow along through some pretty quick twists, as he does in all his previous films, and by ratcheting up the abstract nature of the plot while simultaneously dumbing down the narrative by having that excess of exposition, as if to try spoon feeding the audience the philosophical subtleties of a Dostoyevsky novel, the complexity literally doesn't translate into language well in the setting of a film.I'd actually loved to have read ""Tenet"" as a novel as it's just one of those rare ideas that may just be too big to be effective in the relatively small bounds of a movie. I feel a bit the traitor for not enjoying too much one of those directors whose upcoming work I wait on anxiously, but despite having all the right ingredients this was just more ambitious than cinema or the cinema goer can handle.",Tenet

The white knuckle tension of this stylized sci-fi thriller begins at once as it's opens at a packed opera house in Kiev the capital city of the Ukraine, where the audience awaits for the show to begin, suddenly they are gassed with a sleeping agent knocking them out by a small army of heavy armed men in gas masks and black tactical gear who plan to exterminate them all with multiple explosives. An unnamed special CIA operative only known as the Protagnist, who is brilliantly played by John David Washington in an intense ultra-cool performance, will help save the day, but after being caught and nearly tortured to death, he is rescued by a mysterious government organization called ""Tenet"" who are a super secret shadowy group who are tasked with saving the world. The Protagonist is recruited by them to go on a dangerous international mission and is partnered with another operative named Neil, sensationally played by the charismatic Robert Patterson, to prevent a powerful time-inversion technology from the future which is the hands of a ruthless Russian megalomaniac named Andrei Sator, superbly played by Kenneth Branagh, from the destroying the human race, It seems that Sator has a twisted death wish of causing Armageddon. Can the Protagonist and Neil stop the villainous Sator before it's too late, well there in lays the tale. Masterfully written and directed by Nolan, who gives his film magnificent visual effects and action set-pieces that are absolutely jaw-dropping with amazing sequences of car chases and all-out gun battles some of which are done impressively in reverse, including a show-stopping crashing of a real 747 jumbo jet into an airport building. The pulse-pounding score by Ludwig Goransson is sensational, and the striking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is breathtaking.

It definitely tries to surpass inception but simply couldn't. I expect more from Nolan's casting crew as some characters simply lacked the depth to such a compelling narrative. This is one of those moments when a story is so good but characters simply couldn't add depths to it, for example the way Leonardo or Matthew would. The main character apart and Debicki(Cat) simply fell flat alongwith Andrei. Props to Nolan for such a creative feature. Please Cast better next time.",Tenet

Ladies if you want a nap during date night, watch this film with your man. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 mins. Only time you won't be confused during the movie is the ending credits.

All the actors do a fantastic job, the cinematography is amazing, the action scenes are top notch and the two and a half hours fly by.
The one thing I would say is this film needs to be seen on a big screen with no distractions as yoy need to be focused in what is going on to follow it, it is not a small screen film that you can watch indoors, or at least I couldn't because I would be distracted by my phone or the kids or the cats, it needs your full undivided attention and maybe even a couple of viewings but it is well made and I thoroughly enjoyed it, I may even rewatch it again this week myself",Tenet
659,tinyfordst,The first time Nolan doesn't get a 10/10,7,2 September 2020,"Access my profile and see for yourself, every other Christopher Nolan film ever made has a perfect 10/10 from me. Needless to say I probably expected too much from this one, but within the first 5 minutes I adjusted my expectations because I saw that this film is not going to be an epic like the ones we got used to.Christopher Nolan goes back to his Memento roots by telling a story backwards, because if this film has to make sense to you, you need to know what the ending will hold. That's why people claim it's so great the second time around... The only problem is, a film that isn't great the first time you see it, usually isn't worth seeing a second time.This film had 3 major problems.
1. The music: it was terrible, the sound balance was wrong and the music didn't tell any story related to the film. No Soundtrack CD sales will come from this, where the OST from Interstellar and Inception became legendary.
2. The framing: The shots were flimsy and seemed more like a Shane Carruth budget than a big studio backed film. It broke the story's most important part and never draws you in.
3. The bad writing: Everyone will agree that the film was not great the first time around, it doesn't make sense, not because it's complex, but because you aren't informed of whatever is going on. The leading male understands concepts that aren't simple to grasp, as if he has an IQ of 250+ but an audience member with a higher IQ than Nolan (that's rare) will not even grasp it as quickly despite knowing what the film is about.The acting wasn't great if you take into account John David is the leading role. He was perhaps the only actor who disappointed. Pattinson and Debicki really impressed though, but they didn't get all that much screentime.The first part of the movie is hard to follow, mainly because the music is so extremely loud and overwhelms the dialogue without telling the story together, but also because the viewer isn't given any info about what's going on, and you have to watch until half way for things to make sense. The problem then becomes that the second half is extremely predictable.I didn't enjoy this film. The action sequences were great, but even John Wick pulled that off with minimal dialogue and no complex ideas.P.S. I'm not dumb and it's not as if I didn't understand the film, I did... My IQ is in fact higher than Nolan's, but he could've done it so much better if he took a bit more time on it.",Tenet
660,bbv-69237,Gnab Gib - Big Bang : Nolan missed this time,3,2 December 2020,"Was it a rushed release that caused the massive plot holes and inconsistencies? It looks to me that Nolan was attempting to combine Pulp Fiction and Inception, but he failed badly. Every single part of the movie was great - except for the massive holes in the plot and continuity. This movie proves what Ryan Reynolds said in Deadpool: The Writers Rule. This movie also proves what we all knew before we saw it - there was something not 'right' about this movie. While other movies like Avatar, Iron Man, Intersellar etc. were good before we saw them, this movie was like the ending of Game of Thrones - before we even saw it, we knew something was not right. I do not think that there will be a sequel, despite the ending clearly leaving that option open.",Tenet

And here comes dollar-wood here to exploit it giving no credit to the real survivors or having any sympathy for the families of the victimsReally really bad. I'm tired of these Nolan movies giving people the illusion that they are super intelligent. No one who has ever put together a jigsaw puzzle has said afterwards ""look how smart I am"". No if anything they congratulate themselves on having patience and then to do something that doesn't make them feel so empty inside. Also I'm not sure how he can get away with making a 200 million dollar movie with only 5 actors in 95% of the movie, the remaining being the ""big"" action scenes that make James Bond movies look like the most active thing in the world. But anyways if this movie is some kind of benchmark that the world pandemic is some kind of over with then yes, this movie is a master piece. But as far as I'm concerned people are still sick and dying all over the world so it turns out this movie is not smart, it's a lie to the same people that the director is trying to empower.

Finally gave in to the movie but every time I felt I finally understood something, the scene jumped and I was back to being lost. But I think you can finally understand things after one and a half-hour into the movie, but that's just beginning to understand it, you can't really understand it. Thank God for netizens who understood the movie and decided to explain it to the rest of us.But after all of that, how was the movie? It was okay. I somehow preferred Robert Pattinson over 'The Protagonist' and felt it could be made better.

However, It's not the kind of movie that you need to see on the big screen. You would be better off watching at home with the subtitle so you can understand what they are saying and maybe you have to rewind. A few times. The science was off but which made the movie more confusing plus made some of the sequence out of place and did not make senses. But it was a cool concept that is for sure. Denzel Washington son did a good job. It was a hard movie to watch at times. This kind of movie would do well in a tv series where they have time to explain and take their time develop the plot more.

670,harineem-209-525488,Pretentious trash,3,10 May 2021,"I have watched Nolan movies from Memento and liked them. I even loved Interstellar which was strangely disliked by some of my acquaintances. The good part of Interstellar for me , was the kids in the house were excited to know the Physics of the movie. But this movie is just pretentious trash. The director wanted to show himself as some pseudo-intellectual. No I will not watch the movie 2-3 times to understand it, already regret the time lost watching it once.The fundamental thing in a commercial movie or a fiction book should be the story. You can add other elements like what happens in the world it is set in, like the domain(science, physics , law or magic) but your whole movie cannot be the manual on the domain then its a documentary.Here the director is fascinated by some areas in Physics and tries to build a loose plot around it, that never works. Interstellar worked because there was a strong story of a father longing to see his daughter and the physics happens in the background.The casting is horrid. You never admire or empathise with the lead character who is dull as ditch water. When Daniel Craig gets trapped as James Bond, you know he is going to get out of it somehow. But in this movie you are positive the guy is going to get caught or beaten up. Who picked this guy to be an agent? And who picked John David Washington to play this role? He is really awful, zero charisma!The 3 points given is for the Sator guy and his wife, the only saving grace.I truly feel sorry for Dimple Kapadia who is a very good actress, getting cast in a badly written role for her first Hollywood venture.

While this movie should be viewed twice, I feel like that a movie should not have to be viewed a second time just to understand the basic plot. While I understood who the characters were, and what they were doing (for the most part) I still did not understand everything.

680,jan_kalina,Christopher Nolan Loses His Way With Tenet,5,8 October 2020,"As a self--proclaimed Nolanogist, Nolan is one of the greats to me. Almost every of his films is a masterpiece to me (there are only a few exceptions.. coughs.. Dunkirk and Quay are awful..). Tenet looked very enticing. Nolan tackling time--travel after all. Only he calls it something else, time inversion. (More on that later.) Given the current circumstances, the film was proclaimed as the savior of the cinema industry. So nothing major. Just the first big film event after months of nothing, of this dry season. It slowly became the film to save the universe, the film to save the film industry. It became synonymous with the word 'hype'. If you were to look in a dictionary and find 'hype' there, it would give you the definition and underneath there would be a picture of the Tenet poster.
Christopher Nolan has been accused of making films too convoluted for their own sake, and perhaps the biggest criticism of them all, would be that he makes films without emotion. Hollow at the core. I always disagreed with this statement, however Tenet is that very film that critics accused him of making the whole time. Only this time it is true. Tenet is a bland nothing of a film.Tenet starts out in media res (in a similar fashion to a James Bond film), at an extraction mission of sorts that goes awry. So awry that it ends in torture, and our main nameless character (sometimes referred to as The Protagonist, i.e. John David Washington) biting on a cyanide capsule. Only he wakes up afterwards, not dead, only to find out he has been recruited into an even more covert agency than he was at before. This one cares about saving the world from what could happen. He is given a word and a gesture to help him. That is all. During the opening mission he encounters the casing of a bullet, going backwards from one of the seats. He is then tasked to find this inverted ammo. And its origin.
In order to get to a meeting with an arms dealer, The Protagonist meets the affable and dapper Neil (Robert Pattinson), which further leads them to Andrei Sator (Kenneth Brannagh who speaks in an dastardly diction and fashion, using threats about cutting someone's balls and stuffing them down someone's throat). The only way to get to Sator and find out his motives and plans is through his abused and exploited wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki).
The film spends its better half filling the story with action scenes of great scope (opera houses being blown up, bungee jumping on a building, airplanes crashing into hangars, a boating trip gone wrong) yet despite all this, it is not particularly engaging. There are no real stakes presented, the lead actor is strangely emoting nothing. Not in a cool, suave way. Just no emotions. Pattinson tries his hardest to be the likable core of the film, only his character is not presented to us in any way. Neil just drops in to see what condition the state of the world is, and it is obvious he knows a little more than the rookie Protagonist. Those two leads are just one--dimensional figures. There is no reason given to care or root for them.Elizabeth Debicki as Kat continues Nolan's Dead Wife trope, only to give it a little twist this time. Brannagh is really delightful as the bit over--the--top villain, only again, his character doesn't offer much nor creates any real stakes, only posing a threat over the life of Kat, who ends up being a pawn in the game of these men: Sator, the husband she loathes but stays with because of their son, and the nameless agent, who exploits her for his own gains.
The stakes are never really quite established---only as something worse than armageddon. Later on we hear Branagh's plan and it isn't that enticing. The fact that the film doesn't try to make the audience care about any of the characters makes any world--ending stakes utterly meaningless. Sator is after The Algorithm, a glorified MacGuffin that is described, acts like and looks like the AllSpark cube from the Transformers franchise.
Nolan knows how to spend the studio's money. No doubt about it. The film is big and doesn't shy away from big scope and spectacle. Only the film does this at the expense of the story. Nolan is masterful at using practical effects. The airplane crash scene is practical effects galore. Only that it is absolutely nonsensical. An airplane crashes and blows up, just because Nolan wanted it to be so. The characters are staging a heist and then one of them has an idea to just ram a plane into the airport. Now ain't that a new heist concept?
This is a bad noisy blockbuster that tries to imitate the scope and grandeur of Michael Bay. (I am a Michael Bay fan.) The James Bond, Bay, and Mission: Impossible influences are obviously there, but the action scenes lack the emotional punch or tension. It all ends up as an empty shell of a film that just tries to be as good as those mentioned above. Tenet has got nothing on the scope and the grandeur of the last M:I installment. At some points it feels as if watching a parody of a Christopher Nolan film. The film cares too much about staging these elaborate cool, generic action scenes but forgets any story or characters. To further emphasize the generic nature of the action, the film's climax features a lot of gunfire and military--clad figures.
The use of practical effects is nice but if they don't serve any story, they just end up as an interesting tidbit the PR team can use in a featurette or people in a pub can discuss how cool it is that the actors actually did that stunt on set.
The film is a time travel story. No matter what Nolan says. It is a different time travel than usually featured in films, yes, but time travel nevertheless. Nolan is just using his old tricks here and since it is a time travel film, most of those tricks are easy to figure out. During a retelling of an event in the film Kat spots a mystery woman jumping from Sator's yacht. Who could it be? Of course, only her time travelling/inverted herself. A mystery assailant attacks The Protagonist and is moving in reverse? Of course, it is himself time travelling/inverted (that scene pales in comparison with the Inception hallway fight). If you have seen a time travel sci--fi movie then you can figure these out on your own as quickly as they are set up.
Yes, and now we are getting to time--inversion, which doesn't really come into play until very late in the film. Time inversion really doesn't move the plot forward, it is just a gimmick, a way to reuse some scenes in the film. There is a lot of discussion on the internet about how the film unravels, and people trying to study the mystery. The film offers very little exposition, only that of a scientist who tells The Protagonist: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it"". That's it.
The exposition you get in the film is the same as in the trailer. Nothing elaborate. Apparently it all works on instinct. And then there is a time travel machine, in this case a turnstile, and it just causes the characters to move backwards in time. Easy. The film is so blatantly vague that it borders on comedy. It is as if the film refuses to tell us some information, denying us the name of the lead character. It is as if asking someone for answers they don't know the answers to.
The film is not confusing as some make it out to be. It is pretty simple in narrative. No jumbled up chronology. What it does is it attempts to look smart and throws some buzzwords or tries to create a sense of confusion through the nonsensical dialogue. At one point the characters just start to talk about the Grandfather Paradox just because they feel like it. The conversation doesn't lead into anything, nor does it have any meaning or reason to be discussed. The Protagonist refers to himself as The Protagonist and the antagonists are referred to as Antagonists. Analyze that as you will.
A lot of people are once again complaining about the sound mix and not being able to understand the characters. Now I am a person who has a hearing aid and loves going to the movies for the mere fact that I don't need to have one in my ear because I can hear it in a cinema. I saw the film with subtitles and also understood everything everyone said in the film. No complaints on the sound mixing from me.
Tenet is simply a disappointment. Nolan is not progressing himself forward, he is moving backwards as fast as the inverted characters of Tenet. Tenet is merely an exercise in style, absent the intricate plotting of Memento and The Prestige. Tenet is in no way the film that saved the world, the universe or the film industry. It's just a big, loud, brainless action blockbuster. That is all. Nothing more.
I hope Nolan returns to something more low--key next time. After the abysmal Dunkirk, now there is Tenet, a disappointing hollow film. I hope next time there will be another Memento, Inception, Interstellar or Insomnia in the cards.",Tenet

I don't know what to write in the review, so here is my honest opinion. I started with great hope( bcos Nolan). As the story moved forward, I started getting confused. I was trying to understand what the filmaker was trying to portray. But I failed. It's been a week and I still don't know what happened in the movie.
Generally, Nolan's movies have a certain panache or mystery around it. So you need to shut everything down to watch his movies. But this cuckoo flew over my head( pun intended)",Tenet
692,johnny-89987,"An expensive, complex but weak film",6,23 February 2021,"Tenet is a very bad movie and probably the worst movie of Nolan's whole life so far. Not every movie that confuses the audience and is complex or has a budget of $ 250 million is a good movie. The film suffers from a lack of characterization, the audience can not communicate with the characters. The action movie is not real and in many places it is in the form of computer games. In general, I think this is a commercial film, just like Marvel films, as opposed to saying that it is not a commercial film. But the problem is that this is a bad commercial film and not a good one. At the same time, the film is captivated by Hollywood stereotypes, like the Russian anti-hero, which has been heavily seen in Hollywood movies. That the Russians are bad and the Americans are the savior of the world! This has become very ridiculous and I wonder why Nolan went for such a ridiculous cliché. 5/10",Tenet

Inception
The Dark Knight Rises
James Bond filmsChristopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. Not because his every movie is life-changing, but because he uses the art of cinema itself to its fullest extent. You are familiar with his work: Memento; The Dark Knight; Inception; The Prestige; Interstellar; Dunkirk. Throughout the years he has proven that he is not afraid of experiments and mind-bending challenges. He isn't afraid of complicated stories that the general audience might not ""accept"" because it makes their brains hurt. He doesn't just set the technical bar of filmmaking high, he basically is that bar. He is the Elon Musk of film. This is cutting edge cinema: always on top, never failing to amaze.I took a long pause from writing, and thought that his long anticipated ""Tenet"" would be a perfect movie to start again. How someone could write, film and direct something like this is beyond me. It famously took the main leads 5 hours just to read the script.
Now to what should you expect:It is a modern and intelligent espionage movie inspired by the James Bond films. I usually don't like spy movies, but this was very organic and never corny.It is fast and dynamic both in a sense of action and in how the plot itself unfolds. Just like with ""Inception"", you cannot watch it half-asleep, you have to pay attention throughout its whole 2,5 hour running time. It is a carefully crafted puzzle and should be viewed accordingly.It is a film that is 1000% worth watching at a cinema.In my opinion, the casting was also just perfect. There are obviously no huge tear-jerking Oscar-worthy dramatic performances, but the chemistry between the characters was perfect for the sake of that film. Huge shout-out to Robert Pattinson: even though he was not the main character, he just always steals the show from everyone once he is on the screen. His evolution from a teenage vampire to one of the best actors of today is worthy of another post which will come in the future.And above all it is just awesome. Go watch it.",Tenet
694,AW_McGOWAN,Nolan's Latest (and Largest) Mind Blow,7,20 February 2021,"Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" is a labyrinth of a movie like no other. The renowned auteur's eleventh feature, it has all the elements of a Nolan film amplified to the nth degree: a layered plot mixed with a deeply original screenplay, stamped with mind-blowing visual effects and an ending that leaves us scratching our heads. To say we fully understand it - or even partially understand it - after a single viewing would be entirely false.""Tenet"" is a time travel movie, but the audience hardly recognizes it as such until the final act, and even then we still question what's going on. In a nutshell, future entities have created weapons that operate on inverted time scales. Somehow, these weapons have made their way into the present and it is up to John David Washington's character (simply known as ""Tenet"") to disarm them before they cause global annihilation.At least that was my takeaway understanding of the highly intricate plot.Time travel is a fickle topic that many filmmakers have failed to tackle. However, if there is one director suited for such a complicated challenge, its Nolan, armed with his sharp writing and reputation for digging into thought-provoking concepts with grace. ""Tenet's"" time travel thus comes with a dignified originality. Characters interact with each other on different temporal schemes simultaneously, some going with time and others against it, and the audience must listen carefully to figure out who is operating in which reality and when. It is such a dense and novel execution of the theme that audiences might struggle to recognize it at first.In terms of temporality, it echoes ""Momento""- Nolan's 2000 indie breakthrough film-but while ""Momento's"" use of inverted time was purely stylistic, ""Tenet"" handles it in the diegesis. The director briefly played with diegetic time travel in 2014's ""Interstellar,"" but in terms of narrative, ""Tenet"" most firmly follows in the footsteps of ""Inception."" The the varying timelines operate very similarly to the 2010 film's portrayal of dreams. Unlike in ""Inception,"" however, audiences do not arrive with a preconceived notion of how ""Tenet's"" logic works. Everybody has experienced dreams, but nobody walks into the theater with a preexisting grasp on Nolan's inverted reality.The logistical science behind ""Tenet"" could fill shelves of encyclopedias, so perhaps it is best to move onto its more filmic elements. The special and visual effects are superb. Once again Nolan combines the best and boldest of practical and digital stunts for something truly spectacular. It may not have the visual scale of ""Interstellar"" or ""Inception,"" but it has just as many moments where the audience wonders how they made it happen. The fact that only a handful of viewers were able to see the film on the big screen is a real tragedy, albeit one that almost all 2020 theatrical releases had to endure.Furthermore, John David Washington is the latest to portray a slick Nolan protagonist. The actor plays the part with appropriate level of cool, complimented by an on-point aesthetic thanks to costume designer Jeffrey Kurland. Alongside Washington, Robert Pattinson plays somewhat of a sidekick, filled with knowledge and witticism to bring a touch of levity to the film's intensity. In contrast, Kenneth Branagh provides a deliciously menacing performance as the main antagonist. His severity serves the plot well, and it demonstrates his ability to play someone on the opposite end of the casting spectrum.Lastly, ""Tenet"" is also Nolan's most action-packed movie to date. Outside of the time-travel archnarrative, it is a spy movie dealing with international espionage, perhaps the closest thing that we'll get to the director's fabled Bond aspirations. There are racing fist fights, prolific car chases, and an epic war scene of a climax, all of which incorporate elements of inverted time that make them visually stunning. It is essentially the hallway scene from ""Inception"" done many times over!In total, for those who admire the Christopher Nolan's work, ""Tenet"" will be a feast of familiar quality and daring originality. However, for those who find the director's narratives cumbersome or overly serious, this might be a nail in that coffin of distaste.Personally, I am an enormous fan of Nolan's filmography, and therefore believe that ""Tenet"" is the latest example of how he stands out not by subverting the language of cinema - as many of his contemporaries do - but by pushing its boundaries to new, incredible heights....Still, I must say that I left ""Tenet"" thinking ""What?"" just as much as I was thinking ""Woah!""",Tenet
695,AxProductions,Complex yet simple,7,19 July 2021,"I'm incredibly torn when writing this review, as there are many things about this movie that I love, whilst there being a giant amount that I hate.I'll start with what I loved;The CGI was absolutely incredible, with shots that looked stunning and lent well to the story, and the story though complex, is an easy to understand one. I personally don't get the people who find the story un-understandable.The basic concept is traveling to the past and future to stop the Russian guy from killing himself, and intern ending/stopping time and destroying everyone.The story is incredibly well-done, especially the section where the past and present link perfectly, I appreciate the amount of planning that goes into creating scenes like that. The scene that stands out the most is the fight scene against the Protagonist fighting himself, it's a twist that straight up got me out of my seat. That entire section of the film blew my mind.The other part that was straight up incredible was the ending where we find out that Neil knows The protagonist from a different past, whilst simultaneously showing a shot of the bag suggesting to us, The audience, that Neil is going to die. That was an impeccable use of cinematography, and a perfect character development ark for both characters.Re-watching the Film also reveals the fact that Neil knew the protagonist before hand, with scenes such as where they first meet, Neil knows what drink the protagonist takes, and I'm guessing that's because they he actually knows him. There are many more hints such as this one when you re-watch the film.However, there are quite a few things that this film just did not get right.For one - let me get through the 1 gripe which I have with all Nolan films, and that's the audio just changing volume throughout - if you constantly change your headphone volume though, you can easily understand everyone's dialogue, took me out of the film enough to notice, which isn't good.The second, this is probably a combination of both cinematography and editing, is that every single conversation between two characters in this film, had bad editing. Cuts done for no reason. There didn't seem to be enough coverage for the editor to cut to close ups when important information was being stated, and cut away when something wasn't important.Even though the story is amazing, the script falls apart at points, with some incredibly cringe lines such as ""can the future speak back"" - There is also way to much exposition which would never be said by a normal person talking, such as the scene where The protagonist meets Sir Crosby. Crosby asks if the Protagonist knows about the secret Russian cities, and then the Protagonist explains in insane detail about it. If two people know something, they do not need to explain it to each other, there could have been a way more interesting way to give that exposition to the viewer.Scenes with characters explaining exposition to each other that they already know is common place in this film, and is incredibly annoying when there could be a multitude of ways one can explain things instead of just stating them.The Visuals are beautiful, but the cinematography doesn't actually say anything. There are way to many medium shots, and close ups, for the close ups to have any specific meaning, this may be a problem with the editing rather than cinematography though, but I wasn't shooting this so I can't say. These issue's may be caused due to the fact that half that film had to be recorded backwards, and so it's understandable for other areas of the cinematography to lack.Overall this is an amazing film, story wise, however it has many ""technical"" issues, such as sound, editing, and weird cinematography choices. The Cgi is however insane, and the film is very re-watchable.Cinematography - 7/10

696,politicidal,Complicated but still entertaining science fiction thriller,8,3 March 2021,"Christopher Nolan's time travel themed action movie TENET will probably anger alot of people because it has a lot of his familiar tropes cranked up to eleven. As if he's deliberating trolling people.There's the endless exposition, the dry sense of humor, and a ton of plot twists. And while the Nolanized version of time travel is more grounded than other movies dealing with the subject matter, it's still pretty darn trippy.But I'm not gonna lie I still found it quite entertaining. The performances are pretty solid across the board but Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh are probably the best. Pattinson plays the sidekick to John David Washington and he's pretty cool in this. Branagh is the villain (a Russian oligarch that seemingly has insight into the future) and he's pretty intense in this. He's really acting his butt off.Elizabeth Debicki shifts back and forth as a damsel in distress and a more proactive character from scene to scene but she's not bad per se. I can't say it was necessary to cast Aaron Taylor-Johnson in a minor supporting role; he's boring in his part anyway.The action scenes are great. Nolan remains a top notch action director and it appears that a lot of the stunts and effects are practically staged. A highlight being a plane crash scene (and that's just meant as a distraction no less!).I'm not quite sure if the internal logic of the time travel rules set up will hold up. I'm being honest. But the way that Nolan presents it in this story (called inversion in the script) is intriguing.",Tenet
697,tarekali-19909,"peeling an onion from the outside inwards, and from the inside outwards",7,1 December 2020,"Nolan continues to challenge our established notions of cinema, especially of linear storytelling and cause effect. Watching Tenet is like peeling an onion from the outside inwards, and from the inside outwards. Towards the end of the film you have some notion of meeting in the middle, but you know many viewings are needed to connect the roots and branches of this complex tree.As a visual storyteller Nolan continues to deliver, his set pieces and action sequences are adequate, though some moments seemed repeated from previous outings especially Dark Knight. Some vistas seemed like fillers lifted from random Bond films.The underlying technology of inversion was not adequately explained to a science buff like me, and seemed somewhat glossed over for convenience. The communication between present protagonists and future masters could also benefit from additional expansion. The abusive marriage in the center of the plot seemed a distraction and not conducive to the conclusion.The movie is a challenge to watch in trying to keep diametrically opposite timelines unified in the mind. There are several aha moments when you get the satisfaction of realizing or predicting what just happened, but long stretches of head scratching in between.

As a screenwriter, one of the most important things you ask yourself is...did it make sense? Would the audience understand it? This is ultimately where Nolan dropped the ball. Good effort, horrible execution. The timelines were insanely hard to figure out.Music was a bit out there but it seems Nolan was experimenting with a new composer than he traditionally works with. They had a unique path that many seem to not resonate with.When i heard about John David Washington getting the lead role, i was pretty excited. He looked good in the trailers. To my dismay, his lackluster skills in acting for this particular role was absolutely dreadful. It was literally like watching someone directly reading off a script during rehearsal.

703,monsterhunt-94296,A complicated time-bending film from Nolan.. but lacking powerful heart and soul,8,16 November 2020,"Alright so I finally got to see Tenet and here are some of my thoughts on the film. This, being a Christopher Nolan film, offers an absolutely incredible theater experience. Feeling the bass of the score on the floor, the loud gunfire, the incredible image, it offers one of the most immersive experiences out there. The cinematography here is incredible, and the fight choreography is so impressive. I'm assuming most of you know about the ""inversion of time"" stuff in here and the movie incorporates that so well, and it's even more impressive just how much if it was actually done practically (this IS Christopher Nolan after all). The movie is long, but it is very entertaining and doesn't really drag. I wouldn't say it's to the levels of Inception or The Matrix where time absolutely flies by, but it's still very entertaining. As for the plot, this is probably Nolan's most complex yet. It was on a whole different level compared to Inception or Interstellar, it's basically Primer levels of complex here (but of course Primer takes a mathematical and logical approach to time while Tenet takes a cinematic approach). Although it can be very daunting at first, as the movie goes along things make more sense and it all really starts to come together in a clearer way. I would definitely need to watch this several more times to understand it all, but that wasn't much of a problem to me as I've already learned through various movies that simply understanding everything isn't always the point. Tenet delivers all the spectacle that Christopher Nolan is known for, and it could very well be his biggest movie yet. There certainly isn't anything else like it. All that being said, I'd say there's one flaw that really sticks out here. The spectacle and scope get so big that Nolan sort of forgets about the human side of things. This was basically my main fear going into the movie, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be.
There IS a human story in here, and it has some incredibly human moments, but I think these moments are really lost. I think some more time could've been dedicated to really fleshing this out, and creating not only an awe-inspiring huge spectacle experience, but a story packed with humanity and emotion (see: Interstellar). I think that this is pretty common with filmmakers like Nolan, as they go on moving away from their small scale human narratives and just keep getting bigger in scale they forget about that emotion. Like I said, the movie has a little bit of that emotion but honestly I wouldn't mind if the run time was cranked up even more to make more room for those emotions and make this a true epic. In the meantime, I'll probably be trying to figure out the plot of this move, and I 110% recommend you going to the theater to get that experience. 8.3/10.",Tenet
704,MaverickV,Meh...Meh!,5,7 December 2020,"Nolan is surely a brilliant director, but he misfired this bullet...probably the inverted entropy concept, heightened/increased the overall Entropy of the movie ;) , thereby creating more disorder!In Asian spiritual culture, we say that in this world every good thing taken to extreme can also become more a burden, a deficit, a liability! Nolan is now maybe taking it too seriously (not sincerely!) and this has backfire here. The story is unnecessarily confusing, abrupt and uninteresting...on the acting front also we don't see any better outcomes. It felt actors were just blurting out the lines and seemed more disoriented, probably they themselves cdn't digest the concept...I will look out for the next one from Nolan.

I get the sense that Nolan loves the smell of his own farts. I think his ideas are way too ambitious, and I think he needs another writer to reign him in.

The backstory is nearly nonexistent, the character development starts and ends in a short lunch scene with Michael Caine.Acting? Again, comparing with Matthew McConaughey, Leo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page... The leads are OK but not that interesting, with an exception of Dimple Kapadia.The villain is a stereotypical Russian mobster-type oligarch with a generic bad guy motivation. He sends his team of muscle mountains, by the looks of it, freshly recruited from Russian penitentiaries, to follow his wife and beat people up around London. No one bats an eyelid or makes a fuss. Somehow, his wife is a classy British art expert, although somehow pigeonholed into a generic suffering trophy wife stereotype.The protagonist is a generic tough guy. That's it. He doesn't even have a first name.Kapadia's character is probably the most interesting.That said, some bits are simply mind-blowing, especially the last part, when everything starts coming together.Otherwise, it's a great feeling to be able to visit a cinema again, even with a mask and nearly empty.",Tenet

I also had a really hard time figuring out who the characters even are or why I should care for the first half of the movie....I also thought the sound editing on this movie is terrible and unfinished and it should not have been released in this condition.After a second viewing, I still think the sound editing is very bad to the point it makes it hard to understand the dialogue in places. It is pretty much inexcusable that a major studio would release a movie with dialogue you can't even understand. I also still think the movie is badly missing needed character development particularly for the lead characters near the start of the film.But the story is kind of a fun puzzle to solve if you can suspend your disbelief about the preposterousness of the time travel. I think that is all Nolan was really going for here, and its a decent escapist mystery thrillride if that is all you are looking for from the film.It is far from Nolan's best film....Memento still holds that honor. But Tenet is not as bad as people say. When I got over the initial disappointment from heightened expectations as a result of a lack of other movies to watch during the pandemic, I had fun the second time I watched it.",Tenet
726,cary_howe,Confused mess,2,6 June 2021,"The top reviewer says be patient. What for? To give them time to learn how to tell a story? I made it ten minutes in and I have no idea what's going on, I learned nothing about any of the characters. If the film gets better then obviously they need to cut the first ten minutes because it doesn;t accomplish what it's supposed to accomplish, engage the audience in the story not throw a lot of crap at us that makes no sense then promises if we stick around is may or may not make sense. Here's a thought, hire a writer! I;ve stopped giving films a pass for bad scripts. This one had a 205 mill budget and it barely held my attention for ten minutes!!!!!!! THERE IS NO EXCUSE!!!!!",Tenet
727,v_sttr,I was surprised.,8,30 August 2020,"Good Movie with no time to get bored and loved the Way Nolan tied every question up thoughout the Movie. One could have.
And i was surprised by the performances by all the actors.
Go watch it.",Tenet
728,penofinspiratin,If it wasn't Nolan I would rate this lower,6,31 August 2020,"I think Nolan wanted something to overwrite the Dunkirk failure and ended up using his best idea before someone else dropped something along it's a genre.To me, it felt like I was watching avengers whereby Thanos wants to snap but iron man actually controls the gauntlet.Then we watch the whole story like the vantage point movie but this time from 2 perspectives
One on rewind the other- real-time.Overall this would have blown half my mind
But since it's Nolan's work, I was disappointed once more.Please do not piece this with interstellar or inception.Maybe piece it with memento add a few jokes cook in some 007And I was left wondering why didn't Nolan take the CONTACT '97' route or infuse a bit of primer into the algorithmQuestion Tenet using pie or Infinitum algorithm

729,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,Inventive New Take on The Spy Movie Formula,10,1 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan never fails to direct a groundbreaking, awesome movie, and Tenet is certainly no exception. The film explores some interesting ideas of flip flopping an objects or persons direction on time, and while reverse footage isn't anything new, it's still an interesting mechanic in the film to watch. The film is very reminiscent of old spy movies, John David Washington's nameless character only known as ""The Protagonist"" cracks lots of one-liners and wears a very contemporary suit. The other actors are good as well in their job of bringing life to the world and carrying it along through the runtime. Kenneth Branagh's villain is very reminiscent of old evil villains such as Goldfinger. The action scenes are entertaining, both backwards and forwards. There are a few confusing bits in the movie I couldn't follow and some characters have muffled speech due to the use of gas masks throughout the film, and some things felt unexplained but it draws me in to see it again. Overall, the film was very inventive and proves that even after 20 years, Christopher Nolan is still reinventing the living daylights out of cinema.",Tenet
730,AnAverageNerd,Give it a chance,7,17 September 2020,"Upon entering the cinema to see this film i had my doubts; previous reviews i'd read did not suggest that this film would be enjoyable upon first time watching. A claim which i believe to be untrue! This film is more understandable than expected throughout many of its parts and does a good job of focusing the viewer's attention on details which are important to the story later on. Whilst a second watch will only further this understanding, I personally feel this is not a necessity. However, this film is a challenge to follow perfectly and I'm sure that most viewers (including myself) will leave questioning certain details. The sound mix is also not as bad as many suggest and is only noticeable in energetic action sequences which may be a choice to immerse the viewer as I'm sure it is hard to hear clear dialogue whilst bullets are flying! If you have the attention span and like a film that challenges your understanding of the world then this is definitely worth a watch!",Tenet
731,Silfiriel,Incomprehensible and not because of any complex science,5,8 December 2020,"The acting is great, in which Robert Pattinson excels in this one.
The action sequences are also nice, effects on level, but who'd expect any different.What's really bad is the storyline, the plot, the pretentious ""science"" explanations etc. It is impossible to follow when or how or why.Many reviews here say to watch it second time, now why would I do that??At one point someone says ""everything that existed destroyed"", response was ""and so is my son"". I laughed really hard there :).It's bad.",Tenet
732,tloader-1,Another Nolan masterpiece,8,27 June 2021,"This movie is another testament to Nolan's talent as a filmmaker - to create a story this complex and ensure that it is still (mostly) understandable to people like me! While it is hard to follow, I didn't feel like I was missing anything vital to the enjoyment of the movie.It's crazy how you can see a battle with people going forwards and backwards in time and still get a sense of what's going on!While I'm still not sure I got everything in the end, I definitely found it entertaining and engaging.",Tenet
733,Camerenth,After seeing it twice...,8,19 September 2020,"This movie is a marvel of spectacle and originality. Christopher Nolan is still one of the best directors working today. I am very pleased to see him continue to produce original experiences like this movie. But if you like or dislike his work I feel you'll find the same praises and flaws of his previous works. This movie can easily be compared to inception based on its concept (from the trailer) and rightfully so. What this movie lacks is a strong sense of emotional attachment to the characters you are following. This flaw seems to come purely so that the concept of ""inversion"" is fully explained and carried out by the plot. And trust me, it is a sight to see by the end. Worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find open during our pandemic.",Tenet
734,KissMyAss31193,Mediocricy at it's most Obnoxious,5,5 October 2020,"This movie is annoying. It has a very simple plot, premise and sequence of events and yet it psychotically scrambles every story beat with a thick of fog
of ""COOL!"" and ""SMART!"". And yes it does so, shoutingly.
Courtesy of the sound mixing. Yet it does these things while forgetting about any action films single most important rule: Motivation.
I couldn't understand why anyone did anything because I was never told the reason. Even when it came to the stakes of the story I was not told what it is I need to fear or why.
And I want to be clear on this.
I was actually told ALL of these things, but I wasn't shown.
A good 70% of this film feels like Chris Nolan is reading his script to us like we are his teachers, who'll fail him if he doesn't try hard enough.
But an action film, which this is, that is as convoluted and confusing as this is, rarely delivers an impact.
I like the premise more than the execution.
This should have been simple.
There was no reason to make Tenet that long or dreadfully pseudo intellectual.
I felt pretty mistreated, by this director whom I've come to appreciate as an effective artist.
Anyways, after watching it a second time, I realized it wasn't me that didn't get it, but there is just an overabundance of plot-holes.
So don't pat yourself on the back if you ""got it"", because you can't.
It's a dumb action-time-travel-movie pretending to be so much more.
I hope the next one doesn't suck, Chris!",Tenet

736,dyingrepublicofpanama,Typical Nolan,6,30 August 2020,Can't hear anyone speak. Ear bleeding in parts. Huge practical set up effects. Intriguing and original story. But ultimately soulless.The lead actor is really really bad at acting he gives such a stale performance it looks like he is acting. Like he is on screen and you can tell he is trying to carefully remember what he's doing. Terrible.Storyline is clever and it's visually brilliant but it is a run by the numbers nolan flick.It's worth going to see on the big screen but you will come out of the cinema with a sore head from having your eyebrow raised to the roof for 2.5 hours.Nowhere near Nolan's best.,Tenet
737,LaundryMatt20,Just take a second,8,17 December 2020,"I had a much differently-written review here before, but I read people's reviews and decided to change mine a bit.First, I went from 9 to 8 because I agreed with the complaints after reading them. Nolan is in my top 5 favorite directors, so it's hard to count off stuff for his films when I see them because I'm always super excited for a new one. I still love TENET and think it's impressive in so many ways, but I agree that Nolan has an issue with exposition dumps, telling us instead of showing us. I think the music drowning out the dialogue was only in one scene and it was a scene in which you weren't supposed to hear the talking anyway, so I disagree with that, but I didn't see it in theaters and I know the sound mixing is different so I'll give them that. It's by far not one of Nolan's top 5, but I still think it's extremely creative, overflowing with ideas and great action, but yes it is flawed. The man's too dang creative for his own good lol",Tenet

They do try and explain what's going on but 2 hrs is nowhere near enough time for this to make sense. The general plot is another timeline inverts to ours ( I think) hence you get scenes shown going backwards, forwards and even backwards again. It's almost like they had enough time and budget to shoot one hour and to extend it to normal running time the just show most of it in reverse. Sorry but this is the most confusing film ever, no wonder writer and director are one and the same cos noone else will have a scooby, and that includes all of the Matrix films.

740,WillsFilms,Tenet Is As Convoluted As The Flow of Time,7,1 September 2020,"Tenet is a very interesting movie. John David Washington is good as the protagonist, rather unimaginatively named 'The Protagonist.' Robert Pattinson is fantastic as the mysterious handler; Neil. Pattinson has really proven himself recently as a genuinely fantastic actor and I can't wait to see what he does next. Kenneth Branagh is a genuinely terrifying villain and his insanity shines through his disturbing interactions with his wife, Kat, played by Elizabeth Debicki, and the dynamic between those two characters is definitely the best part of the movie. The action is the clear selling point of the movie and it definitely delivers. It's incredibly exciting, heart pumping and thrilling, whilst being superbly shot. However the weak point for the film is the extremely complicated plot. If someone asked me what happened in Tenet, I would honestly struggle ro answer. I feel like I'll be spending the rest of my life frantically trying to figure out the plot. As well as being confusing, I'd say the film's runtime is also an issue. It's half an hour too long and, as it result, it leads to the film dragging a little at certain points throughout the runtime. As for weather or not I'd recommend this movie. Yes, I would. If you're brave enough to face the cinemas then the action should help take the current world issues off your mind for a while. However, just prepare for you head to be spinning like a wheel afterwards.",Tenet
741,World-viewer,A meditation on turgid self-absorption,2,13 December 2020,"I love sci fi movies in general. This movie however is just a confused mess that takes itself way too seriously. I doubt if anyone, including eminent physicists, would be able to understand this shambling mess - precisely because it IS a shambolic mess. When the plot is so impenetrable as to successfully avoid comprehension no matter how many times you watch it, you begin to wonder whether it is a actually a movie or a modern Enigma machine that has successfully encoded a top-secret message. I would write a synopsis of the plot, but it continues to eludes me, like a well-oiled pig escaping the clutches of a hungry Kentucky farmer.Most sci fi movies require you to suspend your imagination - the science environment is in the background - humanity is the focus. Characters, their development, their conflicts, are the focus. This movie seems confused about what it is trying to do because we develop no relatable connection to the characters, the premise is just ridiculous, the story is told in a haphazard ""off-chronological"" manner that just makes one feel like they are on a psychedelic acid trip, and to top it off the postulated physics itself is nonsensical.The movie however is directed in a very serious fashion, no expense spared. The dialogue unfortunately, is muffled and the direction is poor - whatever flimsy story there is, feels disjointed and rushed. The film seems primarily focused on big action sequences, but I would hazard most of us watch movies for the primarily for the story - and this movie has none - no matter how many times you watch it. There are people writing exquisite reviews about just how intelligent the plot is, justifying it in their own varied ways, but if you need to read reviewers' (subjective) versions of what they feel the story is, just to make sense of the mess you just saw, the director and film have failed in their mission. The action scenes, no matter how cool, no matter how Michael Bay-ish the explosions, just do not make up for that fact. Pass.",Tenet
742,jaredkjacoby,Quite the Experience to Watch,8,11 October 2020,"The plot of Tenet is a little hard to explain. John David Washington's character is forcede to swallow a cyanide pill after an operation at an opera house, but he wakes up in a hospital where he is told that he is a part of the organization, Tenet and his mission is to save the humanity. He is sent to a scientist who shows him that he can bend objects backwards in time. He teams up with Neil to find out what and who is threating the survival of the world.This is the first movie that I went to see in theaters since the movies opened back up. Just being in that auditorium and seeing a movie on the big screen today felt so weird, yet more magical than usual. It was pretty exciting! I have been excited for this movie ever since I saw the trailer and even before that. I try to go out of my way to see blockbusters with screenplays made from scratch. This film is very ambitious and there was a lot at stake here both for the quality of the film and the box office. How does Christopher Nolan's latest film fare?One thing that I can definitely say about Tenet is that it is original, especially for a big blockbuster. The story itself is not the most unique, but it has some of the most unique physics, world-building and scripts I have seen from a big film in a long time. There is a lot of complexity to the story and while it is confusing at first, the longer it goes, the more the physics and story makes sense. It helps that Tenet is one of those films that you need to pay attention to every step of the way. It moves at a brisk pace and details are easy to miss. While the film can be confusing at times, I was never bored by it. I had a blast watching this movie.The world in this film is insane. It revolves around the fabric of time and what going in the past can do to you. There are a lot of scientific terms used throughout and the stakes are high. Just the fact that you have a character who has the ability to go back in time and suck up the bullets they shoot is nuts. I love it personally. There are not that many films like this one in terms of world-building.The action set pieces are even crazier. They are so well-done and so beautifully shot, that my mouth was on the ground during these set pieces. Not only that, but it looks like the film had some great stunt work. There was one point where John David Washington was riding on top of a fire truck and the best way to describe that scene is badass. I could really use that word to describe that entire sequence. The most insane parts of the film are the scenes that have the set pieces go in reverse. They look stunning and they reveal a lot in the story. The twists are great and some of them genuinely surprised me. The film is filled with action so if that is what you are looking for, you will get plenty of terrific action here.As for the performances, John David Washington is great in the film and his character is given some really good development for someone that is shrouded in mystery. He does not even have a name! Robert Patterson is terrific and he has the best dialogue in the film. Elizabeth Debicki is good in her role, but her character did not do much until the end. However, she was very sympathetic with her relationship with her husband. Kenneth Branagh plays the villain and he is menacing beyond belief. He is pretty scummy too, but Branagh did an amazing job here. The villain is pretty good because of his presence and the way he plays mind tricks on his opponents. The supporting cast is really good as well.I need to mention this even though it is minor, but the dialogue is excellent in this film. It is well-written, it fits the tone of the film and it is very clever. There are several scenes that had me wanting to laugh because of the delivery and lines. It is a lot better than it would be for a film like this. The tone is pretty intense, but the film does make fun of the insanity of the world from time to time. It feels very balanced which is rare in films like this. The script treats the stakes seriously, but it does have fun with itself when it needs to.As for the technical aspects, the cinematography is gorgeous in the film and the set pieces are shot beautifully. There is some shaky cam and there a couple moments with some odd editing choices, but it is a great looking film otherwise. The sound design is great as well. In a way, I felt like I was a part of the action at times. It could very well be my theater, but the sound added intensity to the film. The musical score is awesome as well. It was original and it was powerful. There is a piece at the first reverse set piece that blew my mind a little bit.As far problems with the film go, it is a style over substance film on my first watch. That could easily change but there is so much action in the film, more than I ever expected. While the story is really good, some of the characters could have used a little more development. Lastly, I wish Debicki's character got to do more in the film.Other than that, I thought Tenet was great. It feels very different from most blockbuster films story-wise and tone-wise. It brings a unique world to the table and it matches it with a story worth telling. The action alone makes it worth a watch at least once. This film has some of the best set pieces I have ever seen. All of this makes Tenet a joy to watch.",Tenet
743,ReliableReview,High concept sci-fi action,6,7 December 2020,This could have been a masterpiece. Concept is original and fresh take on time travel. Action scenes and big budget effects are there. Acting is good. But the exposition and plot was hard to follow so I was lost and had no clue what was going on. But it's good if you don't think too hard and just know who's the good guy and bad guy and the basic gist is they're trying to stop a time travel weapon. I find Nolan's recent films hard to understand. Memento Batman Inception are great and I can understand. Interstellar and Tenet are a tad beyond my intellectual reach but that's not to say others won't enjoy this and you have to respect original stories which is so rare nowadays. This is definitely a novel take on time travel. Other time travel movies I enjoyed more are Edge of Tomorrow and Predestination but this one is a fresh take with backwards time travel.,Tenet
744,Deux_Vega,Nolan went too far ...,4,8 December 2020,"Look, i'm a big Nolan fan. I consider him the best director of this time, but with Tenet I felt he went too far in both concept as the storytelling.The style is very much like The Dark Knight and especially Inception in presentation. So in that regard it wasn't very original in experience.Nolan also has a unique way of giving information and don't make you watch long dialogues that state the obvious. But in Tenet the cuts and storytelling are just so messy. I couldn't help but thinking; ""what?"" most of the time only to figure it out later, or not at all. It went too quick. It's just ruining the experience.Actually It felt quite pretentious. Like, look at me doing all super intelligent with smart dialogues and super sharp cuts. Aside from some scenes in the beginning I found the dialogues quite boring.Another typical characteristic of Nolan is time ... Many of his movies are about playing with time and I dig it usually. But with Tenet he went to a very tricky concept that's so unbelievable it instantly felt like fantasy to me.It's so hard to wrap your head around it together with some scenes I feel like, so ... how would that work in real life? It doesn't make sense If you would apply this in a wider scope real-world setting or what the impact would be on life itself. It only works in this situational settings of the movie ... and even then, It still doesn't hold up well.And that's one of the things Nolan was always so good at, making It believable. But with Tenet I can't help but consider It a lot of non-sense.Even some scenes don't hold up If you would think about the real-life situation. He skips on these parts and with focus on what's happening you're not realising it, but out of that scope, looking it from the other persons perspective ... what? No way!Aside from that, the production is top notch. How he even was able to bring this wacky concept into picture Is an achievement in itself for sure, because it's pretty insane he was able to pull it off. That's why he still gets 3 points. But enjoyable? No.I found this one a big miss. The music wasn't as great as his previous movies either. The acting was fine, and started out well, but started to get hurt by the story and almost made the characters parodies of themselves. Especially Branagh (Sator).It's not a movie I would consider watching again. He went the direction I was already hoping towards the ending in Interstellar he wouldn't do, but then he did. And then he made It even wackier in this one.Nope. Memento, The Prestige, Batman 1 & 2 and Interstellar up until the end are his absolute highlights for me, but this Is his worst one to date in my book.Hope he doesn't continue this path.",Tenet

The editing and the way the story is told just complicates instead of helping the audience to understand. Also the way some scenes and characters move from one encounter to another feels like lots of pieces of the movie we're left out. In general is such a mess of a movie, not enjoyable at all, specially if you try to make sense out of it.Somewhat 10min into the movie one character says to another ""... don't try to understand...""

747,deager,A Brilliant Film,9,13 September 2021,"Think of using the old Abbot & Costello bit of ""Who's On First"" as a way to explain the space time continuum. And then take that idea, boil it down a bit to a James Bond style thriller to save the world from WW3 that is happening in the future (add a mother and her child as a side plot to boot) throw in art theft, plane crash, moles within the secrete service or maybe not, transference of time with a character catching up with himself leaving as he is arriving and various other bits of fun then you have this extremely entertaining, often confusing, but ultimately understandable, brilliant nonlinear movie from the master of such movies himself, Christopher Nolan.If you listen and pay attention at the beginning when we have our hero, John David Washington in discussion with the head of the Indian industrialist.(as well as other things), Priya - Dimple Kapadia, explaining where the bullets from the future are coming from you will get a sense of the premise of the whole thing. Reverse Chronology.This movie requires your utmost attention, your openness, your ability to listen. All is explained and there are clues along the way. The acting is superb. Washington and Robert Patterson have great chemistry, friends who do not trust each other but would go in harms way for each other. I found the storyline with Andrew Sator, played with the utmost evilness by Kenneth Branagh, and his captive, beautiful wife Kat, played with defiant fear by Elizabeth Debicki to be the weaker part of the plot, even if necessary to the overall story. However it does lead to a most satisfying conclusion.Yes it might take two watching's to grasp it all, but it is worth every minute. One of the best movies to come along in a long time. Nolan never loses sight of what he is about, nor control of the story. He knows exactly where he is going and how to get there. The script takes us on a wild journey of time out of wack, megalomania, saving the world from a war that is to be. Each actor brings their A game, committed to the story and the telling. Give it the time it deserves. You won't be sorry.",Tenet

So people get confused whats happening. He should have given more hints, eg protagonists entering and leaving the inversion machines, to make it easier to follow the plot.I got it after the third run through. I think a movie should always make the main plot clear in the first run. The script failed here a bit. Inception made it much clearer.",Tenet

It's obvious they spent millions on special effects-unfortunately they paid amateurs to tie it all together. What a freaking mess of an action film! If that wasn't bad enough you can hardly tell what they're saying due to their strong accents at times. A lot of scenes are of them talking sooo softly it's just difficult to hear them. They couldn't even get to volume right in the movie. It's ridiculously loud at times then it's back to normal. The so-called background suspense music quite often overtakes the actor's lines. This is basically a poorly thrown together, extremely confusing and hard to follow movie that some people will think is pretty neat and others, like me, will be happy the movie finally ended. I think it's time for me to watch Inception and remind me there actually are really good movies that do well with a complicated plot.",Tenet
752,NarniaIsAwesome,Tenet is... Fairly Original Yet Murky,4,20 September 2020,"I hate it when film makers treat the audience like they're stupid. We don't need to be handed every piece of obvious information; we can figure it out. We have a brain. On the other hand, a film's job is to present a story to us, from beginning to end. The movie is supposed to be the entire experience; why make a film if people will have to Google the plot afterwards? If your story needs further explanation, you haven't told a story, you've told a snippet of a story.This is one of the main reasons 'Tenet' is underwhelming. A confusing story is one thing, for it can eventually be figured out. But this script is actually murky, reasons and plotlines hidden and distorted with no explanation. What's worse, the characters always seem to know exactly what's going on all the time. They don't help guide us through the maze, they drag us through behind them.The film's other flaw is how wasted the idea is. As stated in the movie, it's not time travel, it's time inversion. Quite different, but the only payoff we get is fighting a rich dude who's a jerk. I honestly didn't think there would be a stereotypical world-hating villain in this movie, but that's what we get. His presence mucks up what would've been a more interesting story. Also, the rules of going into time inversion are hilariously cliched - things like ""Don't touch your past self or you'll explode"" or ""Hey, that person I saw earlier was actually ME!""That being said, there are a few exciting action scenes and the reverse fights are kind of cool. The actors are doing their best and it's not their fault that you can barely hear some of their important dialogue (thank you, sound mixer).I get the feeling this was almost a vanity project on Christopher Nolan's part. It's been a little while since he made one of his signature ""complicated"" features and wanted to make this one as artsy-fartsy as possible. Two or more viewings would be required to understand it properly.As I wrap this up, remember that a good movie isn't one you have to watch twice. A good movie is one you want to watch twice. 'Tenet' is the former. If you want a good film that messes with time, just watch 'Back to the Future' again.",Tenet

I almost got out of the cinema but decided to keep on my seat until the end (unfortunately). I can't say much more than this - the two stars are from some nice visual effects and a couple of moments in the story , but all and all I consider this one as a complete disaster.",Tenet
756,neoclone07,Nolan outnolaned himself... to a downgrade,6,30 November 2020,"Well, just watched the movie and I gave 6 stars due to the already renowned technical achieveness Nolan is well-known, and Tenet has it all around. But as mentioned on several other reviews here, the movie is very confusing. By the way, throughout the movie I felt so dumb due to the fact that I simply couldn't understand half of what was going on. Luckly, I was not alone at that thought.
There are some predictable moments which I won't mention here because of its spoiling nature, but, com'on, the airport fight sequence? That was waaaay too obvious! That ""we're not alone here"" line just said everything (oops, I said I would not mention any spoiler, maybe that's just me doing a reversed review).
Anyway, as I'm from Brazil, though I speak english quite decently, I was well-aware of the complex storyline, so I paid total attention to the subs, and that's why I couldn't realize how sound design was loud and filled of mumbled lines (what makes me think it's kinda a Nolan's trademark, having characters you barely understand, just like Bane from third Batman movie). That loud sound throughout the movie and low speeching is a common issue on severeal reviews from english speaking audience, so I thik it was even harder for them to understand what was going on screen than it was to me.
Back on the movie, it is not bad... but with such a hard-to-get story and long screen time, I don't feel inclined to watch it again any sooner, let alone pay the outrageous ticket price just to understand it.
I loved (and still) several Nolan's movies... Memento, The Prestige, Interstellar, Inception... they all have plot twists, or a final resolution or no resolution at all... but they're gems, you watch them and will watch again because they all make sense in the end. As for Tenet, I don't believe I will ever understand it. The final sequence almost made my brain squirmish in a selfdevouring blackhole.
Perhaps that's exactly Nolan's point here... make a movie no one can understand... not even him, I guess.",Tenet
757,mutantdani,Really?,5,27 August 2020,"I value the courage to accept the challenge to do a movie like this but unfortunately it does not work. The idea in which the plot is based is not well explained, making the movie incomprehensible. The spectator just disconnect from the movie and the plot does not make any effort to make it less complex. So you just watch at explosions and action with some aha moment in the climax.I love Nolan's work and I risked my life during the pandemic to go to the theater for this garbage. I respect the experimentation but this plot should never gone into production.Don't get fooled by the great trailer and previous Nolan's masterpieces: this is a failed movie.",Tenet

But Tenet is without doubt the worst movie he's ever made.Its like he took the complexity of Inception, the Time jumping of Dunkirk and remade ""The Night Manager""... Everything was reused.Christ you've been got Batman's butler making a Cameo albeit thru badly fitting false teeth. Maybe Michael was doing a homage to recently departed friend Sean Connery?Again we are ""treated"" to Ken Brannaghs Russian oligarch, Pattinson appears to be doing a Tom Hardy impression from Inception and the whole thing is shot like its sponsored by a yacht club.I love Chris Nolan.I hope he has spent lockdown writing something new and dare I say it... More linear in storytelling?",Tenet

762,dtrani,Confusing at first; satisfying at the end,8,19 December 2020,"A movie that never lost my attention but somehow was confusing right from the start. For the common audience, this film may seem like it makes no sense and may even become boring. You honestly have to force yourself to watch through the entire film to completely understand everything.
But even with everything being thrown at you in a weird, confusing way, the film makes you feel extremely satisfied when you do finally figure everything out in the end, and man, is it worth it.
Nolan never ceases to make something worth the money and time and this is no different. Definitely one of his more complex and mind-bending concepts. The only thing I found to be a nuisance in this film was the constant changing of the aspect ratio. Well over 10-15 times do we see the film change aspect ratios as the letterbox (black bars top and below the film) disappears during different cuts. It can be annoying seeing the letterbox appear and disappear during the film.
Other than this, Tenet was definitely worth it!

765,berndgeiling,Playing with time,6,17 September 2020,"Nolan is certainly one of the most brilliant film makers of our time. I loved Inception and Interstellar. Both are breathtaking examples of his concept of highly entertaining movies on an equally high intellectual level. But, and now that's the difference to his latest film Tenet, they have a touching emotional background as well, which turns them into masterpieces.
In my opinion this time he overdid it a bit. Technically brilliant of course, breathtaking sequences, but you can reach a point of intellectual smartness, which quickly can turn into simple boredom, when you forget to deliver a heart and soul too. Sorry, but this time it didn't work for me.",Tenet
766,emailmadhurimasen,Christopher Nolan's James Bond,6,10 December 2020,"It is an entertaining watch; it will give you great adrenaline rush. It is a thriller till the end. All that's good. But in spite of it, the film ends up being more of an action film like James Bond. It is very difficult to emotionally connect with any of the characters. And, like almost always, Nolan sucks at creating rounded relatable women characters.
Cliché female lead plus the most obvious kind of Russian villain, topped with a hero with a swagger. Add to it a dash of science fiction. And voila, you have 'Tenet'!
I do not think the story line is difficult to follow for any moderately observant and attentive viewer. What I don't like is how the film appears to want to bamboozle and befuddle you and act too smart, if you know what I mean.
Loud, explosive scenes which seem like a globetrotting adventure travelogue sewn together. One mission follows close at the heels of another like some video game. With plane crashes and countless explosions, it is a big spectacle which I personally found empty of enough substance. But keeping all this aside, it's definitely fun to watch. Once.",Tenet
767,ue-53660,Overly Complicated and a Bit Boring,1,30 August 2020,"Not an absolutely terrible movie, but overly complicated and not very exciting to watch. I was bored half way through it. I have found the acting not good at all, almost robotic from all the actors. Lines were muffled and difficult to understand between the loud background noises. At one point I thought the characters were speaking in Russian behind the cheaply designed plastic masks or the words spoken backwards due to the story line. But no, it was English the right way apparently. Some action scenes were all right and kind of interesting when going backwards and forwards at the same time, but that's about it. Set design looked cheap to me. I was glad it was all over at the end, when the usual Hollywood movie end scene line was: ' Thank you, you saved the world! '. There must be a way to finish this type of tired blockbuster movies with a different line.",Tenet

770,jacoblawrence-19058,Revolutionary Effects; One-Dimensional Characters,7,18 July 2021,"It's not the confusing timeline that keeps this movie from being one of the greats. Nolan is a master of nonlinear storytelling and I actually don't mind the fact that this movie is not 100% comprehendible the first time around. Sometimes cinema is supposed to challenge what we believe to be reality and we shouldn't give a low rating simply because the movie reminds us that there are people smarter than us.The camerawork and visual effects are simply stunning. If watching a battle scene simultaneously unfold both forward and backward in time isn't revolutionary for the world of cinema, then I don't know what is. It gave me the ""I've never seen anything like this"" feeling that was reminiscent of the first time I watched The Matrix.It's the script and the acting that hold back this film. The protagonist, ironically, isn't overly likable. There's little to no character development about him. I mean, he literally has no name and refers to himself as ""The Protagonist."" His emotional range is also limited. He gets hypothermia from a car explosion, wakes up wrapped in foil blankets, and just goes about his usual overconfident and unphased behavior. There were no ebbs and flows to his demeanor whatsoever. It's worth noting though that Pattinson delivers a strong (and even more ironically, a more protagonist-like) performance.The script also fails to go as deep as its subject matter. We're talking about a ""temporal war"" and the best line we can give Debicki after Pattinson says every single person on the planet will be destroyed is ""including my son."" Yea of course your son is included in ""everybody on the planet."" It's like Nolan ran out of things for Debicki to say or care about and just wore out the age-old ""you're a mother and you're looking out for your son"" identity.Overall, Tenet is definitely a spectacle to watch. The idea behind it will stay with you, but the characters and script keep it from being on your all-time favorites list.",Tenet

The problem is - it's trying to be too clever.
So clever it's way too confusing!
Now, let me say, I had anticipated this from reading various reviews beforehand, and armed myself with a blow-by-blow story synopsis to help me along the way.
It didn't help - and I had to keep pausing to think it over!
So... imagine watching this in a cinema, where you have a one time chance to try and understand what the hell is going on!
Of course, you could spend a small fortune and go see it multiple times!
I gotta say, some of the action sequences are actually really cool, but mostly it's like you have suffered from instant amnesia. You've just seen something but you can't seem to remember what actually happened!
Christopher Nolan has somehow made a movie that's far too complicated to fully understand. Furthermore, to make things even harder, the dialogue is so far back in the mix, much is indecipherable.
For those who can be bothered, I guess multiple viewings on bluray (with subtitles and a notebook) will clarify everything.
Then of course, there are those who totally get it - or at least they say they do!
As for me, if I could have time travelled and seen my own future reaction, I would have not bothered seeing this movie at all. With a running time of 2 hrs 30 minutes, once is enough. I've now lost interest and erased this movie from my memory.",Tenet

Tenet takes the same practical efforts as usual Nolan movies to explain another mind blowing concept. Tenet has numerous pros ranging from the opening sequence to the aeroplane and highway inversion scenes. Another scene to watch out for it the red filtered confusing scene which is another delight to watch. The turns more and more confusing but ultimately provides some sense and understanding near the end which saves the movie from much damage.Tenet suffers some a lot of major setbacks including improper acting performances,convolution of the story as it goes on and the underutilization of several characters. Tenet felt a bit dry and out of juice at times which has the potential to give the viewer a sound sleep.

777,scorpiogemini,Nolan has lost his edge,6,21 February 2021,"It pains me to write this as Nolan is my all time favourite director of my favourite movies; His Batman triology. We know by now that Nolan likes to keep the tempo fast and fluid, that he with Hans Zimmer has an awesome soundtrack and also unfortunately the dialogues in his movies are not the best. But it does not matter. In Tenet though, it did matter.The dialogues are very bad. The script is not strong. The worse thing for me was how the characters fell flat. Many of the scenes are so improbable, the way lead female for example, opens up about her life to a total stranger in just about 1 minute of dining with him. Or the scene where the lead character meets the female scientist and both are as cold as robots while she demonstrates something out of this world that would make anyone freak out.In fact, this whole movie seems devoid of all emotions. There is only one emotion though; The hunger the lead female character carries around, her hunger to kill her tormentor, and her feeling of being poweless and in despair and weak because, she is a mother ad has to protect her child. (I have watched my fair amount of time paradox movies ,mostly indie movies so I did not struggle on that aspect of the movie).I don't know what is happening to Nolan, but since his movies Batman Begins and The dark knight, he seems to slowly have lost his touch. I just hope he will find his way back, and also let someone else work on the dialogues in his scripts.",Tenet

779,maidwell-45616,"Could do with an ""inversion"" to correct huge issues",5,22 September 2020,"I'm a massive Christopher Nolan fanboy.... Memento, The Dark Knight and Inception are 3 of my favourite movies of all time.Tenet however will not make it on to that list.
At times its pace is far too rushed, giving you no chance to digest the plot ideas thrown at you mid explosion, at other times its frustratingly slow, for instance focussing too intently on the dynamic of the married couple instead of explaining what the hell is going on in the world ending scenario.Even as the movie finishes you are left to fend for yourself and make up your own idea of what's gone on.. but not in a satisfying way like inception's brave and ambiguous spinning top finale.I feel like there was a truly great film in there somewhere, it has all the ingredients but it got lost along the way in the jarringly loud explosions and score, too sparse screenplay, paper thin characters and convenient/ confusing plot devices.There is a lot of talk that the only way to appreciate this movie's intricacies is to watch it at least twice, this was partially true with memento too but the difference with that film was it was still understandable and incredibly rewarding on its first watch, in my view Tenet just isn't, I see it as a flaw if a story can't be thoroughly enjoyed on any level without repeat viewings or by trawling the internet afterwards for fan theories and explanation threads. I love a film that makes you think but it has to give you something intelligible back and it's themes should at least be consistent.Such a shame as I was really looking forward to watching it and was pretty convinced I'd absolutely love it.
Instead it's a 7/10 for me for the admirable original concept, cinematography, acting and the (failed) mental workout. Could've been so much better though and doesn't come close to hitting the giddy heights of inception.",Tenet

783,ChrisInMiami,A masterpiece of filmmaking but it will frustrate mass audiences,8,3 September 2020,"Critique first and movie story/spoilers further down.So Christopher Nolan delivers another mind bending movie. If you watched Inception and thought 'Could he have made it any harder to follow?' Christopher Nolan just responded 'Hold my beer'.I understand the script was 10 years in the making and you will see every bit of that detail on screen and you will almost certainly only understand half on first viewing. As visually stunning and intellectually stimulating as it is, it is hard to imagine it will appeal to a mass movie audience...the Marvel Cinematic Universe it is not. The biggest shame is that for all the time spent on the concept and creating a script that truly captured those details, the sound editing almost destroys it. One of the plot devices requires the characters to wear masks (a Nolan trademark by now) through most of the movie and there were several scenes where whole sections of relevant dialogue were unintelligible. There were also sections where the amazing score by Ludwig Gorranson completely drowned out the dialogue. It became an exercise in frustration, trying to understand the plot through the context of actions that do not play out linearly. For all the times I ever railed against poorly delivered exposition I am now ashamed. I was not alone in this opinion, the 15 friends that rented the theater with me felt the same way. I recall seeing the Matrix for the first time back in '95 and knowing it would take two or three viewings to get it all, when virtual reality was still pretty conceptual and not a part of our daily lives as it is now. Know this now; the Matrix was kindergarten and Tenet is your college thesis.Nolan is a master filmmaker and Tenet is no exception. Every second on screen serves the story. The acting is phenomenal and I loved the way the dialogue was delivered quick and to the point, invoking the feel of a David Mamet movie.They were very tight lipped about the story and after the first 10 minute trailer dropped a year ago everyone assumed it was a time travel action movie but it is better understood as a time reversal movie. If you are traveling through time you are skipping over time and landing in another; in the Tenet universe you can travel backwards and forwards in time but no faster than you normally would; you cannot skip time.SPOILERS
Having only seen the movie once I hope I can convey the story accurately without giving too much away. The story opens with an amazing raid/rescue on an opera house where we learn the protagonist (really, that's his name) is part of a team that is so clandestine no one person knows the whole mission and you can only know who is on your team with preplanned code phrases. The rescue goes awry and he is captured. Facing interrogation and torture he chooses suicide by cyanide pill but to his surprise wakes up alive and well having been rescued while unconscious. The pill was a fake, a test it seems to determine how committed he is to a mission he does not even know. Having proven his loyalty, he is made next level, that is he gets to know what the clandestine operations are all about... inverted time. Sometime far in the future someone has discovered how to 'invert' objects, that is how to make them travel backwards through time. Inverted objects are being discovered all over the world, mostly moving on a black market controlled by an arms dealer, Kenneth Branagh as perfectly sinister and menacing as any villain ever was . Inverted objects have reverse entropy. An inverse bullet will return to the gun, but only of course if you fired it sometime in the future and inverted explosions suck people toward ground zero instead of away. Our protagonist must make contact with the dealer and trick him into revealing his connection to stop objects from traveling backwards because the more inverted objects invade real time, the less stable it becomes. Along the way the protagonist roots out other members of his team (Robert Pattenson) for help and coerces the dealer's reluctant wife into the cause.This inversion plot device is the catalyst to amazing action sequences where car chases must occur backwards, you have to run away from the fight to engage it, you must un-fire a gun to kill your enemy and the damage you see around you foreshadows the conflict to come. Each plot twist sends us deeper into time reversal where we discover that not only objects can be inverted but also people. And if people can be inverted so can their plans. And if the plans come backwards from the future how can your mission succeed if everyone in the future knows what you are going to do? The story explores many such questions posed by the inversion concept.Tenet is a masterpiece but it's also a big pill to swallow even if you could understand everything the characters were saying the first time.I give it a 10 on concept, 8 on execution and a 5 on mass appeal.",Tenet

That's it!There is no point going deeper into it.Nolan just added a ""rewind"" gimmick while the characters time travel to the past. This is the only thing that makes this movie different. Take out this gimmick and you realize how thin and cliche the main story is.I am sorry to say but I did not like the lead actor. His presence was dull.Wow!! The movie had a budget of 200,000,000!!

788,Yvie81,"""Just because an idea is over-convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool."" - Sharon, South Park",3,12 December 2020,"I wanted to write a whole thing about the lack of interesting characters in this movie, but Bertaut (other reviewer) has basically already said all I wanted to say.
Maybe it's because my 'female mind' is not interested in solving any plot-puzzle when the characters are unlikeable cardboard figures. It already starts in the first half an hour. All the main characters to me felt like they were catapulted into the movie (some almost litteraly, like Pattinson) without any backstory, and then you're just expected to care about them and their destiny. Well sorry, but I didn't. Even when the movie lasted for 2,5 hours there was no decent character arc for any of them. It was all about the complicated plot and how cool the action scenes looked when part of the scenes were in reverse and going forward at the same time.
And sure the cinematography looked amazing but that alone doesn't float my boat.
This just felt like a James Bond movie with an overly complicated plot, but at least there's some sense of humour in James Bond movies!I'm sure if you watch it a second time things will make more sense (as some people adviced), but the problem is, I'm wasn't intrigued enough the first time to actually want to sit through that 2,5 hours again. And yes, the extremely loud and obnoxious music score is definitely another reason why I don't want to!When Inception came out I remember it was spoofed by South Park and totally dissed by one of the characters (Sharon) saying ""Just because an idea is over-convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool."" Well, Inception was só easy to follow compared to this! And actually, Inception did at least make you care about the characters (at least in my opinion)..
I for one can't wait until the South Park spoof of Tenet comes out though!",Tenet
789,alcosta-197-774442,Poorly constructed,2,3 January 2021,"This is a movie based on some interesting concepts about physics (such as a mention to the positron), but which is poorly deployedCharacters which pop up and disappear without us knowing exactly their roles and purpose, dialogues which make no sense, storyline which is confusing and poorly thought ofThe producers should do a tenet and try again, this time with a solid storyline",Tenet
790,Educhico,-,3,27 February 2021,"Tenet seems to be Nolan's justification for his own cinematic contribution. However, we recognise the loss of a necessary emotional focus at the expense of a presumed originality in the narrative structure. Which is also not thought out in the totality of the proposed experience, as if instead of constructing the narrative around the mechanical proposal, he had to build a film around an initial visual idea. In the end, it neither recalls the nostalgia of its influences nor offers really anything new apart from the initial curiosity.The biggest flaw of the film is the lack of a clear idea of what it intends to be, with a narrative that does not revolve around the temporal utensil that the director introduces (as already happened in the previous Dunkirk), rather functioning in parallel to this and trying in points to justify its inclusion. This means that, if the used trick is apparently an integral part of the narrative told, as an objective for both sides of the barricade, its replacement by any other device would not modify in any way the story told here.
In a duration of about 150 minutes, with what seems material for several episodes, we recognise the emptiness of a story that during the first hundred minutes only jumps from place to place, without any notion of characters or consequences. And, in the end, it is just a variation on stopping a mechanism that will end the world as we know it, concept to this point already as tiring as it sounds.At first, what is presented as a spy film from its prologue, derives in its most basic form, resembling the worst examples of the famous British spy's saga on which Nolan admittedly grew up and was inspired by. Nevertheless, at the same time it tries to show a certain level of (non-existent) drama taken from a Le Carré's novel. In fact, we see in the character of Elizabeth Debicki her exact interpretation from The Night Manager; as the wife of an arms dealer, controlled through her relationship with her son and unaware of the real implications of her husband's business, in an attempt to offer an otherwise absent level of humanity.Unfortunately, if in that mini-series we could rely on Hugh Laurie's occasionally creepy charisma, in a narrative cleverly told through the relationships between the central characters, not only is there no time here for it among so many scattered locations and events, but Brannagh's interpretation as a one-dimensional villain is simply bad. From the needless Russian nationality (with the correspondent accent), accompanied by violent and empty threats and incomprehensible motivations, his lines are the greatest sin of a character who makes us turn our eyes with his ineptitude in this story. In fact, when we hear the line ""If I can't have you, no one else can"" addressed to his wife, we question if we have entered the wrong room (remembering, however, the lack of films for such a mistake and immediately the sadness of knowing we are in the correct room).As for the temporal mechanics that the director proposes this time, as at the end of Interstellar, the unnecessary justifications only remove us from the immediate appreciation, trying to understand the concept and meaning of its formalisation, instead of simply enjoying the mystery and entertainment of its visual execution. Because unlike Inception in which they served as a framework for the rest of the film's action, the explanations here serve as pieces of information about what is really a more complicated concept that it is complex.
Because, what we end up seeing on screen is the same kind of time interactions and paradoxes that James Cameron used in Terminator. But, instead of a narrative affected by that device or a drama for which it is dispensable, we're presented with a manual on it, hidden behind a generic film without any memorable characters or events.
In addition, the hypothesis of revisiting past events in our timeline through access to a second timeline that works independently and contrary to the first, ends up bringing together different concepts (time travel and parallel timelines) and not justifying the sudden evolution of the idea.And if Nolan has never had the particular ingenuity to shoot action scenes, creating instead interesting scenarios to shoot, that ineptitude is clear in this movie. Apart from the sequence passed at the airport (still with an unnecessary and uninteresting real plane crashing) - even later revisited from another point of view, where we can see the temporal ingenuity and understand the action in its entirety -, no other scenes provide an equal level of enthusiasm.
The third act, apparently taking full advantage of the mechanics at stake, does not allow a complete understanding of the action, with a series of similarly dressed soldiers running through a deserted environment, without notion of objectives or who to follow beyond the Protagonist (also hidden behind a mask). In the end, this even results in an empty exchange between the main character and the villain to prevent the activation of the device before the final countdown.Even the most casual action sequences reveal a lack of inspiration from the director who does not know how to take advantage of the practical effects he cares so much for. It isn't more obvious than in a van heist, boring in its editing and execution, where each action takes too long. And then, you even hear Ludwig Göransson's musical composition trying to offer the scene the rhythm it lacks, highlighting our boredom.
Also the chance of the meta-linguistic nomination of the Protagonist (literally called as such) does not serve any purpose. If his role as a mere pawn between other characters' intentions is called into question for a few seconds, in the end his ""revelation"" as the real protagonist brings nothing to his character, since he has always been an active participant throughout the narrative.In the end, the real time exercise is the waste of time Nolan put us through. As immemorial as dated, the director finds himself increasingly lost in the ever increasing budget, without the genius of his early work that told a story around the mechanics of time that couldn't be told any other way. Not saving the current cinema crisis, perhaps it can retrospectively remind the author of what led him to initially devote himself to this industry without losing himself in the process.",Tenet

794,Gorillaboi,Is Nolan losing his spark?,6,28 December 2020,"I was tempted to give this 7/10. But then I asked myself.... ""Am I giving it a higher rating just because it's a Nolan movie?"". Because, truth be told, I didn't actually enjoy this movie. Instead I felt like I ought to enjoy it because I'd already convinced myself beforehand it was supposed to be good. And I feel this is a problem that other reviewers (that have given it a high rating) suffer from.In my opinion, a good movie shouldn't have to be watched 5 times (along with commentary) for its plot to be understood. And a movie doesn't need to be over-complicated for it to be clever. But Nolan tried to do too much and gave an end product that....Had a poor lead character/actor. He may well be his father's son, but he doesn't have his acting talentsPacing was bad. Typically, this Nolan movie gets the plot moving too quick and as a result it skims over important pieces of information. The cynic in me thinks this is done to mask its many plot-holes.Dialogue - short, quick, vague.....yet every character suddenly becomes an expert on a very complex topic. It leaves the viewers waaaaay behind.Editing - makes the dialogue and acting even worse, with its over-editing. Does a 30 second conversation (between two characters) really need the camera to cut/switch between the two 10 times? Whatever happened to leaving a camera fixed on the person doing the talking, and letting things be explained with a well-paced and well-acted bit of dialogue?Action was average. And made difficult to appreciate when the viewer is still trying to figure out what the hell is going onSo yeah, Nolan has taken a time travel movie and made it more complicated than it ought to be through poor pacing, acting and dialogue. Oh, and again an over-bearing score which makes it even more difficult to follow what the characters are saying!",Tenet

796,TheOvereducated,High quality B movie,6,6 March 2021,"The film clearly copies from other science fiction movies. There are similar scenes and ideas with iconic films such as the Back to the future trilogy and the Matrix trilogy, as well as recent ones like Looper and Nolan's own Inception and Interstellar. With that aside, the film had some good characteristics, but also many bad ones. The more you thought of it afterwards or in my case after seeing it twice in the cinema, the bad ones dominated, making the film a high quality B movie.Having also seen Inception, The Dark Knight trilogy and Interstellar, Nolan's directing and writing style are found here too. He often has ambitious ideas, can build impressive action scenes and create entertaining cinematic experiences with high production value. However, as a screenwriter, his dialogue and representation of human relationships often lack depth. The dialogue often feels inauthentic, unnecessarily complex, superfluous or shallow and compromises an otherwise impressive scene (e.g. ********* SPOILER: Extremely important scene towards the end, where the character portrayed by Debicki kills the bad guy sooner than planned, knowing that this could destroy the entire planet! And then she says on the phone to her colleague, ""I killed him earlier. I couldn't wait. It won't matter, unless you didn't do it (the thing he was suppose to do). Tell me you did do it, huh?"" **********).The lead actor's performance (Washington) was okay I guess?... whether intentionally or not, he highlighted the story instead of the character. Pattinson's interpretation was weak and Debicki's annoying. Branagh's performance was bad - he didn't feel like the character but rather like putting on a performance for the role. That's why his performance was the same from beginning to end (same voice, same look) and he weakened a very important character that should have been riveting since he was basically the core of the story.On the contrary, what was impressive was the ""time reversal"" scenes mixed with real time. The editing, sound effects and music enhanced the action scenes and they were impressive, without any noticeable CGI.Overall, the film was ambitious. The acting was BAD, yet the film somehow managed to be complex and entertaining during my 1st screening at the cinema. The fact that important information about the plot was revealed slowly during the film and that there were things we were contemplating even after it ended, are what kept us engaged throughout. We did leave the open-air theater entertained and I decided to watch it again in the cinema. Now, knowing the story, the bad acting and the shallow dialogue dominated my experience and worsen my review of the movie.Maybe Nolan should give up screenwriting.

Thank god Robert Pattinson was cast as Neil since he was the only thing elevating those Neil + Protagonist scenes.

The acting is great and the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat. Loved the music score and every moment of the story.
My biggest issues with Tenet was that it felt a little bit too long from the first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes, if it was shortened a little bit then it would have been perfectly fine pacing. Another thing is that sometimes the audio with explosions, gunshots, or intense music scores made it hard for me to hear any dialogue and maybe if there were subtitles it could have been acceptable.

Then on top of that some of the scenes seem to be cut short and jump straight into the next scene without any context leaving me wondering how we got there and what it has to do with the previous scene.That being said I thought the idea of not only going back in time but traveling though time in reverse was really really cool. I can only imagine how strange that must feel. Super cool to think about. And then I was also impressed by the practical effects used throughout in the action sequences.

820,catebaum,The most plot holes ever,3,1 January 2021,"There are so many issues with this film. Firstly, apart from John David Washington, Aaron Taylor Wood, and Robert Pattinson, who do their utmost, and at times manage some charisma through the opaque screenplay, I cannot say anything positive about the other main actors. In particular Elizabeth Debicki, who is as lifeless as she is tall, and Kenneth Branagh, who seems to be doing an impression of Antonio Banderas with the worst lines imaginable delivered with most schlock in film history. Why these two lesser tier actors were chosen for this movie is beyond me, but then again, perhaps all the good actors turned it down based on the horrendous script. It's the only explanation.The script is so bad I can't believe anyone dared tell CN it sucked. I can't imagine how he thought it was OK. Inception and Memento do the same tricks with time travel, but they work because they never break their own rules.Exposition is king here, with terrible Netflix-movie quality lines being spewed without grace or poetry: balls through the neck, really? And the fact that the actors agreed to it? What? They must be embarrassed. The beauty shown in filmmaking in Interstellar and Inception is lost entirely, and this is for several reasons:
The characters are paper figures, no backstory. We are asked to root for a woman who is hateful and bland.The scenery is bland and un-Nolan-like.Masks again. People speaking through masks. Serious, Nolan? Much of the film is lost in rambling dialogue, massive amounts of exposition, and a lack of continuity. At one minute, something's important, then something else.So, issues:1. Why would The Protagonist risk his mission saving the entire world to sort out this boring housewife and her son, who is of no importance in the grand scheme of things? Never explained, maybe the most elaborate courtship that never gets him laid anyway.2. Why bother with her, when she married an arms dealer/gangster and knew all about him? What kind of person does that? And yet, The Protagonist runs all over for her, and only her.3. If the future Tenet organisation knows about the technology, why not just go back to an orderly time and destroy all necessary inverse technology?4. Why does the future Protagonist not warn himself about everything? Why does Neil not just tell him immediately who he is and how they are best friends? He loses nothing by doing so.5. Why would Kat not tell TP immediately that her husband wants to end the world? Instead of 2 hours into the movie?6. Why does Priya tell TP about the algorithm 2 hours into the movie? THIS WAS THE MOVIE7. If the CIA pills are fake, then the fact Sator plans to kill himself with it has no effect on the end of the world, as he won't die.8. Why do we meet a scientist who says they have only found a few backwards bullets and a piece of wall and a drawer of bits n bobs with inverse technology when clearly there are whole armies of hundreds of people who have been using the technology for years and know all about it? WHO IS SHE? Feels like she is the scientist mentioned by Priya that killed herself after discovering the technology in the past, and if so, then TP met her way in the past and time travels between her lab and India, but this is not mentioned at all in the movie and we never find out.9. The scientist clearly knows about Tenet, and is part of it, because it's their password, so if she is, she would have to already know something about it as Tenet was formed to deal with inverse technology. So why would Tenet have her in a lab with no information when they already know about inverse technology enough to have formed Tenet? And even if they did, what, TP in the future sent her the bullets and wall? In which case, he already time travelled enough to set up Tenet and knows exactly what the bullets are! UGH.10. If the Grandfather Paradox is not seen as true in the future then why would they think what they did in the past would affect their future anyway? DOH11. Who are these people? In the scientist scene we are told it's like WW3 but then it's one man killing himself. Makes no sense.12. If the only thing that matters is the algorithm, stored in the thing in the city, why doesn't the team go back in time and wait until a quiet moment to go and fetch it instead of going bananas and having an all-out battle with WHO by the way, who are they?13. If this battle went on so publicly, the CIA would have known about Tenet for years already. No secret to anyone.14. Why crash a plane into the Freeport when all that Neil and TP have to do is contain one weakly man and pick three locks to get to the turnstile?15. Why does TP fight with himself in the Freeport when he knows it's himself? Why does he not question Neil about this, who clearly knew already?16. How does the turnstile work? They seem to be able to go anywhere at any time, when surely the point is you can only go back in time on your own timeline, i.e. you have to have already lived it, and you have to see yourself in the proving window going in, or you'll disappear, and yet this rule is ignored immediately by all, who seem able to go anywhere at any time through the turnstiles without saying how.17. If you can only go back on your own timeline, the battle scene and the Freeport scene is undoable as the characters have not already been there and done that.18. Why does Priya live in a castle in India she never leaves for her own safety, but firstly is seen walking about in the street when TP visits her, and then goes to London in a car to oversee the death of this very boring Kat woman of no value to her, especially after promising she would leave her alone? And she is immediately killed! DOH19. How can Kat go back without a mask? Everyone else is inverse then they go back. The soldier says it to TP the first time, that if you go back you have to wear a mask. She's just going forward, being herself. If people can only go back in time inverse, how can anyone be time-travelling, especially Neil, who always appears to be going forward?20. If the algorithm is solid chunks of metal, then whatever it is has to have been copied by now. Ridiculous.So many other things. So many. Just lazy, terrible filmmaking. Just awful. I had to write this review because I waited months to see this, and was so disappointed that I woke up today upset.And to boot, no Hans Zimmer soundtrack! Boo!",Tenet

I love a number of Nolan's films, chiefly the prestige, the Batman films, memento and inception. However, this one... I didn't love it. I respected it and to a large extent I think it's a very well made film, but for Christ's sake, I should be able to enjoy it 1st time. I'm sure I will grow to like it more, but based on 1st viewing, it's a 6 for me. That's all down to the spectacle. The story was complicated and not helped my the sound mix.

823,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,A movie that will make your brain hurt and ears ring.,7,28 August 2020,"Finally, a new movie out in theatres, and a good one at that. Christopher Nolan returns with his latest mind-bending spectacle led by another fantastic cast. As might be expected in Nolan films, this was a visual feast for the eyes. The uniquely crafted action sequences mixed with the amazing score by Ludwig Göransson make for some of the best moments in the movie. However, this might be Nolan's most confusing movie. (This makes Inception look like it's for children.) Not only that, but the sound mixing was audaciously bombastic. In other words, the dialogue was a muffled whisper whereas the music/sound effects were a roaring thunder of a jet plane. It made it impossible to hear everything and follow along making me wish I watched it with subtitles. There's no doubt about it, to fully appreciate this piece of cinema, it demands multiple viewings. In fact, a second viewing would probably improve my score for it. (I just don't want to abuse my hearing again.) But as it stands now, this was a good movie with moments of greatness.Score: 7 out of 10

For me it was two and a half hours of unreal theory distorted by sound and SFX.Everyone I ask say that I'll understand in the second, third or fourth viewing. But why? I couldn't sit through it once.If a lesser known director went with this script he would've been thrown out. The best part is the film will still collect a billion at the box office. I wish I had such diehard fans.The two leading actors - John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were just not believable in their roles. Dimple Kapadia has an important role.

I feel like I need to watch a 3 hour documentary about it first. I do however think I got a basic grasp of the over-all plot, and it didn't seem impressive enough to justify the mind-bendingly hard work to understand everything that happened (on first viewing at least). Maybe it could have worked better drip-fed as a TV show, with a bit more explanation.As an intentionally clever and complex multi-dimensional film for physics theory majors it might have been a success. but as 2.5 hours of cinema entertainment i'm inclined to say it was a failure.",Tenet

827,wesseldj-48581,Comical,3,26 December 2020,"If you ever have watched the 2003 indie movie ""The Room"" then you know that that movie was labeled as one of the worst films ever made. However it was said by the actor and director of the movie himself, Tom Wiseau, that the movie was intended to be black humor, hinting that the awkward dialogues and bad acting were put there deliberately to create confusion and was not meant to be taken seriously.TENET felt like such a movie. But what worries me the most is that TENET was probably in fact a serious attempt at being a pretentious movie. The plot and dialogue were absolute nonsensical that it slowly became comedic, were it not that Nolan intentions probably was to make an intelligent movie, however done it so that it was deceiving and played games with the audience perception, but underestimated the intellect of the audience, meaning you cannot cover up nonsensical plotlines with confusing dialogues. Now I am all for absurd dialogues in the style of maybe like Quentin Tarantino's movies, but it needs to be executed smartly, not randomly.Therefore as a deliberate black comedy, I would have given this movie a 9, if it was intended that way, but I think not. So I give it 3 stars and this movie might end up in the list as one of the worst films ever made next to ""The Room""....",Tenet

829,Grismar,Don't listen to the nay-sayers,8,22 August 2020,"You're best off not reading too many reviews - Tenet is best unspoilt. Sure, like any ""time travel"" movie (air quotes needed here) it's not always easy to follow and Tenet does a real job on you. I feel some of the reviewer hate is really just anger at not getting it on the first 'third movie I watched today' viewing. And no, I don't think I'm spoiling anything by telling you it's a time-travelish mind bender, because you're tolled in the first scenes going in.There's definitely some flaws here - I didn't particularly like the innocent mother and child motivation of the protagonist, although I feel the kid might turn out to be more important in a sequel. Then again, Tenet is finished and I hope it doesn't get a sequel. It does a good job of exploring a really interesting sci-fi fantasy idea and I think it'll be on lists of 'favourite time travel movies' for decades to come.And like any time-travelley movie, there's some glaring plot holes and paradoxes that aren't really dealt with in a satisfying way. Then again, there's already more than enough exposure here and these kinds of movies are partly fun because of the figuring out you have to do after you walk out the theatre. Most of the holes, I could find some explanation for, but it would have been nice if there had been more subtle clues leading to those explanations. Perhaps upon a second or third viewing, which I'm likely to go for.If you're going in for an uncomplicated broody action romp, expecting the next Dark Knight, you may be disappointed. If you expect a mind bender with the clean simplicity of Memento, you may be a bit overwhelmed by Tenet. But Nolan delivers another movie that fits his oeuvre well and I think it's extremely enjoyable, although it may have a bit more cult appeal than blockbuster potential, which may be surprising given the budget and Nolan's director superstar status by now.",Tenet

834,mikeburdick,Life's too short,6,21 June 2021,"I really wanted to like this film. John David Washington is a terrific actor with a magnetic screen presence, and I was able to finish it because of him. However, ultimately, the film was not worth the investment.This isn't the first Chris Nolan film I've had issues with. I was a huge fan of 'Memento' and watched it a couple times in the theatre, then rewatched it recently with my daughter. (It holds up quite nicely, I might add.) It was clever and fresh, yet wasn't simply a protagonist going through the motions. In this film, like 'Inception', I find he tries far too hard to be clever, and misses the basics: Why should I care about these people? What's their motivation?Are the action sequences fantastic? Totally. Can you follow the basic plot line? For the most part. But the sci-fi gimmick that the story is built around, while interesting, makes the action difficult to follow and the plot points difficult to connect. And unfortunately, the action and plot points are all the film has to offer, since you end up not really giving a damn about the characters by the end.It's worth adding that even the sci-fi gimmick isn't that fresh. 'Coherence' is a low-budget film that has a similar idea, and 'Looper' isn't bad either.Wish I could give this a higher rating, but action and gimmicks do not a film make, especially with so many great though-provoking films in recent years, such as Villeneuve's 'Arrival', Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite', and Garland's 'Ex Machina' and 'Annihilation.'",Tenet

842,INTXb,Fantastical production but nonsensical,6,27 August 2020,"Nolan's experimentation of time in all of his films is fantastic but this one went too far to trying to look ingenious. It ends up being nonsense disguised as something intelligent.Nolan pushed the boundaries of sci-fi into fantasy in Inception, and it mostly worked, but this one is more fantasy then sci-fi. You will have to suspend belief the size of a mountain to be entertained. Apparently just willing an object that is reversed, such as a bullet, will make it work in reverse, huh? It's also explained in the film that the heat from an explosion will have the reverse effect on a person travelling backward in time (i.e. being frozen instead of burned) but this should mean the reverse laws of thermodynamics would apply in all other manners as well, even just a warm day should felt as a cold day, etc. The parts where people are travelling backward in time also don't seem to make sense but it is difficult to decipher what is actually going on most of the time.The two leads execute several fantastic plans that seem impossible without a lot of time and resources, but somehow you're supposed to just accept that they are these exceptional spies without ever getting any details, including character development or backstory.Most of the production is fantastic though, especially terms of the cinematography and the color palette of the film.By the way, don't expect much humor, there was only one part where I heard anyone in the theater laugh.The audio was also extremely poor, I had to strain myself to hear most of the dialog.",Tenet

Score, editing, cinematography, Washington, Pattinson, the kitchen fight. Absolutely awesome and thrilling in every scene and aspect.
The plot and story will leave you feeling puzzled but why not? I would love to be able to make absolute sense about the plot and if it really needs 10 more screenings I am up for it.
I love Nolan's work; but I am also able to look beyond the hype. Just remember Inception. All these layers and levels within the story, for what? To get some industry espionage on the way? So, why does Tenet have to be much, much more than what we see?
Don't get fooled. It is a great film, and if it makes you think and wonder, just enjoy it even more. Remember the hundreds of films you watch and forget. This won't be one of them.",Tenet

847,MovieNinjaGuy,"Disappointing, which is what I was expecting.",4,29 August 2020,"Awful like all of Nolan's non Dark Knight movies (which in contrast I think are spectacular and probably the only reason why I keep giving Nolan a chance).
Muffled dialogue. Intentionally obscure I reckon and too much of the whole tell but don't show stuff most of the time.Zombie female characters acting with that sort of annoying attitude as if they have seen everything that has possibly happened all before so they don't care and constantly have an advantage over the male characters but at the same time being physically useless mostly. Old fashioned in that sense. Female main character is only concerned about one thing whilst the world is ending and her motive is the constant tell but don't show approach which doesn't work in movies to make you feel even remotely invested.No sensible motive for the main ""villain"", who sort of appears out of nowhere 1 hour into the movie. By then it's almost too late to even care what you are watching. Far too loud music at times, like Dark Knight without the essence of threat or stakes being raised. Nonsense ""plot"". Nonsense MacGuffins which make totally no sense. People screamed from roof tops when there were a few MacGuffins in Star Wars. Here we have inverting machines located at weird locations, an algorithm that looks like a nuclear bomb spread all over. These things are used to explain some major reasons for things happening (Well you go into this machine / revolving chamber so... just forget everything we told you earlier too btw, hmmm why?)Why was the revolving chamber at the airport, near the fake painting storage facility? Why if the female character could heal from a gunshot wound by being inverted could the main character not get rid of his cancer and just invert himself to a healthy 20 year old? What is the limitation of the inversion? It is not well explained. How was the villain going to achieve WWIII exactly? It is all so vague to be honest. A sci fi movie works best if you set the stage and set some boundaries of the reality you create. Whenever you break those boundaries too much or don't set them clearly you've lost me, as a story writer can then just get away with doing anything (See the likes of Endgame introducing a second time travelling device which I think is an example of very disappointing or lazy story telling too).On the plus side this movie has some good looking effects and good Imax cinematography. Maybe Nolan should have been a cinematographer for a better story teller director or something. His Dunkirk I thought was bizarre and emotionless, his Interstellar is the most boring non fun and pretentious Sci Fi movie I've seen in the cinema. Movies can be serious but even Schindler's List had a few jokes in it to keep you captivated and entertained and more importantly see that there is light even in the darkest of times in human history.Don't bother unless you are a Nolan superfan. You will no doubt think this is another ""masterpiece"" as almost every second review states here.To me it's mindless nonsense wrapped in a shroud of ambiguity to pretend it's clever somehow.Tenet might be the only 2020 movie I will see in the cinema as the mask wearing is just not a pleasant experience for near 3 solid hours with trailers. I wanted Nolan to make it worthwhile but I just don't think he pulled it off.
The movie will find an audience I guess but I don't think personally I'll bother with another Nolan movie again.",Tenet
848,pete-murphy97,A cryptic watch that reveals itself with time,8,3 September 2020,"Tenet is not an accessible film at first glance, which may be its biggest flaw but also potentially its most redeeming and enduring quality; it dares to be different against all odds.Nolan's latest entry grants only the most stolid and doggedly determined viewers the right to absorb its dense esoteric subject matter, material folded over itself multiple times again, like finely assembled origami.
Beset with sound mixing issues, an at times impassive tone, and a concept that almost foists a quantum physics tome into its viewers hands, and a tome on Greek mythology too, for good measure - the motion picture explores the very 'motion' of the picture, leaving behind the casual many that are unable to keep up with its higher-brow exposition. One line that sums it up is there's a ""technology that can reverse an object's entropy"". On first viewing, it's perhaps better felt than understood.Well-cast Robert Pattinson as The Protagonist's (John David Washington) sidekick, Neil is a suave, fairly louche character. He is rather contrasted by Washington's steely character, who has moments of wit and muted panache coming through, although not often enough to be truly felt. Michael Crosby (Michael Caine) makes a brief, but standout performance. Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) also shows notable acting flair, caught in the eye of the storm of the plotline.Nolan took more than five years to write the screenplay after deliberating about Tenet's central ideas for over a decade, so it's abundantly clear that some significant thought went into this project. The very title word 'Tenet' is a palindrome and a reference to the 4-way symmetrical Sator Square, the oldest datable representation of which was stunningly found in the ruins of Pompeii (a location referenced in the film). Numerous references to the occult square feature throughout the film, with each word of the square holding significant meaning in various areas.'Sator', the surname of the antagonist arms dealer Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) is a reference to 'Saturn', and is a word of the Sator Square. It refers to Cronus or Chronos, the personification of time. Cronus maintains the course and cycles of seasons and the periods of time. This mirrors the role that Andrei Sator plays in the plot, as an arch manipulator of time. Cronus represented the destructive ravages of time which devoured all things, a concept that was illustrated when the Titan king ate the Olympian gods - the past consuming the future, the older generation suppressing the next generation. As shown in Sator's conflict with his estranged wife over custody of his son. The wider plot is an allegory for this great conflict between the future and the past, colliding at every moment without us realizing it, deciding the fate of 'posterity'. A jealous Cronus and the mythological theme of castration features, as the metaphor for vanquishing posterity (the future) runs deep through the plotline.The score departs from Zimmer's brand of expertise, exploring instead the pulsating, roaring, mechanically crashing sounds of Ludwig Göransson's fierce, and at times, tender, effort. The soundtrack, by many people's accounts, drowns out parts of the dialogue; almost seemingly a trap expertly placed by Nolan and his sound team in order to beckon a second, more detailed, viewing with subtitles. And that you should.8.3/10",Tenet

850,YouTubeblack,A great brain teaser!,8,5 September 2020,"This a very fast pased action movie which also uses sci-fi elements. The events which take place in the film are in forward direction in time as well as in backwards direction in time simultaneously.I can see a lot of people comparing it with previous Nolan films about how it lacks depth when it comes to the characters and the overall message of the film, the underlying theme etc. But don't see it like that. This film is made specifically to show how the scenario would be if we perceive time in a different way. It's like a thought experiment, but on film, Don't dig too much into it (as a character says in the first half of the film, feel it.) and just enjoy the cause and effect of the events which turn into great action sequences.Instead of comparing this movie with inception, see it more like Keanu Reeves speed/ mission impossible. It's a fast pased action film with a very generic plot which is, 'save the world before the bad guy blows it.' A generic story but with a Nolan twist. This movie atleast needs 2-3 rewatches because it is presented like a puzzle, some of you might get it in the first viewing some of you wouldn't and thats fine. (In fact it's based on worlds oldest puzzle, the stator square) After watching this second time, I was really fascinated about how they came with such complex concept and actually put it in action.Again, not a perfect film but quite an experimental one. If this wasn't made by Nolan it would have been called underrated. But the fact that Nolan made it, people are now critial. So we can say Nolan is actually competing with himself by now just like what happens in the film, because the bar he set for himself is pretty high.I really wished instead of a film they should have turned this into a series, Nolan's brother already has experience with shows like Westworld.

I saw it three times, understood about three quarters of the plot, and have given it eight stars.I do have a question though.

It seems like every single reviewer was either completely impressed or completely hated this movie! Either rating it a 10 or a 0, nothing in between! The reviews are extremely polarized! It makes it extremely difficult to decide if this is worth watching or not?! Considering it's around 2.5 hours long and requires a fair amount of risk, (with regards to catching the wuhan virus) by going to the theater to see this, it would be nice to know if it's actually worth seeing this, who would like it, and why?!

854,guyau-399-68372,Big budget flop drowning under incomprehensible dialogue and plot,1,12 December 2020,"This is by far the biggest disappointment of the year. I saw Christopher Nolan bagging the studio for releasing Tenet on HBO - he's lucky this movie made it anywhere near a cinema release. I'd be demanding my money back if I saw this in a cinema.It's hard to know where to begin listing this film's failures. Dialogue is the main problem - hard to hear, but also far too much of it, trying to explain and build the silly, over-complicated plot line. They forgot the movie maxim: show don't tell, and the actors also struggle with their lines, particularly John David Washington who often looks as confused as the audience, and a miscast Kenneth Branagh is unconvincing as the Russian heavy. Only Elizabeth Debecki delivers any depth in her cliched damsel-in-distress role.As for the plot, who knows what that was about, saving the world from Armageddon or something, wrapped in another time warp theme represented lamely by reversing the video. Only the exotic locales and action scenes, a la Bond but not as good, kept me watching, the only thing to justify that huge, wasted $205 mil budget.",Tenet

I can't believe Time travel could be pulled off without plot holes. I would be lying if I said I understood it when coming out of theatres but more I thought back on it, the better I understood it and clearer it became. Nolan always brings something new to movie industry. This time he pulled off not naming the main character stunt. Movie has wonderful character development as well we can see views of main character changing as movie progresses. Inverted characters interacting with forward moving character, I haven't seen anyone pulling this off. Just processing this scene in my mind took days, while Nolan directed it! A brilliant mind indeed. I don't believe I have seen such an exceptional movie in last 3 decades of my life. Please don't give bad reviews to the movie if it's too complex for you to understand.

858,Weirdo-Magnet,"If you don't understand it, watch it again.",9,7 January 2021,"The amount of people giving this movie a low rating because they didn't understand it, or turned it off, is so unfair.
Just because you couldn't be bothered to pay attention or are unable to follow an in-depth plot, doesn't make it a bad movie. If you didn't understand it, I recommend watching it again. If you turned it off, why are you rating a movie you haven't even watched?????
Maybe, these are the kind of people I see looking at Facebook or taking a selfie on Tik-Tok while the movie is on, then complaining they don't understand what's going on.
This movie is amazing. The story is a bit complicated to understand, but the concept of the movie is so good.

865,guasco-2,Nolan's first BAD film.,5,27 January 2021,"As a huge Nolan fan (he's easily my favorite director of all time), I'm deeply sad to say that this is Nolan's first ""bad"" film. I use the term ""bad"" to indicate that the film is not enjoyable. That's the whole point of films, games, comics, books, etc right, to be enjoyable to the audience?Enjoyment from a film can come in all forms. Some films are enjoyable because they speak deep truths about society and demonstrate a sense of catharsis for its characters to characters. These types of films emotional resonate with audiences. We can see ourselves in the heroes' journey, so to speak.Some films are enjoyable because they are exciting. They stimulate the audience with huge action set pieces and comedy. They put a grin on our faces as we escape our own worlds.Tenet, sadly fails in both.The film gives us so little (virtually zero) character development in its main characters. So much so that the audience feels alienated and continues to ask themselves the question ""Why?"" ""Why don't I care about any of these characters?""
Whereas Inception gave us a deep emotional character study in Cobb and his demons, we know virtually nothing from the ""Protagonist"". He doesn't even have a name. Sigh.Tenet fairs better on the popcorn side of entertainment, but falls extremely short due to one reason alone, technical proficiency. Yes, the film has some good set pieces and some really well done choreographed scenes. But these scenes are drowned out by a terribly mixed score that's blaring in almost every single scene.
To top that off, the film cuts so quickly between scenes, that action set pieces mean nothing if we don't, A- understand character motivations and B-understand the extremely complex motif (inversion). We are left with nothing but loud action scenes that we don't understand and don't care about.Inception and Interstellar both gave us complex plot devices in dream worlds and the theory of relativity/gravity/time. But both films were mixed better, had deeper characters who we cared about, and had a slower speed to help us catch up with what we just watched.Overall, Tenet fails as a ""film."" For it lacks the ""tenets"" of what makes a ""good""/enjoyable film.
Perhaps it would work better as an expensive music video or short concept film.",Tenet
866,nyshrink,Gibberish,5,27 September 2020,Even for Christopher Nolan this film makes no sense.

Great to see Tallinn albeit from the main roads and Linnahall.
Have to give huge credit for Nolan attempting a complex structure of a premise but within it a cartoonish plot akin with villain in funny threats. Don't really need those plots or characters (Branagh loves playing Shakespearean type role play).
Still didn't get a sense of emotion from our main lead. But he's charismatic and a good looking chap that can helps being the opposite to the villain's main character. Too many silly type Bond roles would've spoilt it for me.It's really good. Better again.",Tenet
870,BlizzyFoxTF,Dense intellectual Nolan passion project that baffles more than it inspires,6,12 September 2020,"Nolan is mixed bag. This comes from a person with a deep deep appreciation of Nolan's works. By integrating intellectual elements and creative narratives into mainstream films, Nolan is arguably the 21st century's greatest director, becoming a household name synonymous with Spielberg in the 70s/80s. He is one of my favourite directors, but as my taste for cinema changes over the years I underwent a re-evaluation of his works (The Dark Knight is no longer a 10/10). While he can always churn out intellectual concepts, dense scripts and mind blowing non-CGI action set pieces, his films also suffer greatly from choppy editing, overstuffed exposition, awkward direction, and most of all, giddy confusion. Tenet is no different. It is a typical Nolan fare, exemplifying both his genius and flaws to a tee.The first half of the movie is one of the most lackluster pieces of cinema Nolan has ever concocted, though at this point in his career it is nothing new. Nolan can bore people at the beginning of his films. However, I would argue that Inception did a better job at its ""inception"" than Tenet, albeit sharing similar conceptual goals. The movie is not impressive until it introduces a core idea around halfway through, and when the film enters a this new realm where it plays with its established internal logic, it becomes a hell of a ride. Overall, Tenet feels like the veritable mind twister like what Memento did two decades ago, and to some extent the last decade's fan favourite Inception (which I absolutely adore).The crazy plot of the film will take multiple rewatches to decipher. The ambition of Nolan might have eschewed other crucial elements of good filmmaking, and it may come off as full of himself, but at the end of the day, Nolan films are must sees. A solid recommendation.",Tenet

875,shabanavdulaj,Muscular filmmaking!,6,30 November 2020,"Tenet is Nolan's visually most breathtaking film, but it lacks heart and emotion. Think of it as a bombshell you'd like to be seen around with, but not as someone with whom you'd want to spend your midnights talking.Nolan is one of the few directors who can bring everybody to watch his films and create a cinematic momentum in the film world. And he is doing that consistently, ever since he made The Dark Night, the movie that elevated him to the stratosphere where he takes residence to this day. Now, although his films are some of the biggest money-makers in the business, I consider Nolan to be a slightly above average filmmaker.I used to love Nolan's films, but as I've been rewatching some of his movies lately, now I think that they are some of the most boring films ever. The concept and the story are exciting, but all the freaking dialogue ruins everything. Gallons and gallons of exposition that feel forced in the mouth of the characters is not good writing. Nolan's characters feel very cartoonistic. If you check, except for Heath Ledger, none of the actors portraying Nolan's characters hasn't been nominated for an Oscar. Nolan has worked with some of the best actors in Hollywood, but he has failed in pushing them to give their best.His writing is always on behalf of the plot. He is a cerebral, plot-driven filmmaker, and the concepts he comes up with for his movies are mind-consuming, but something lacks in his films. To present his invigorating and complicated ideas, he has to sacrifice his characters. His characters are just pawns he uses to explain and further the plot. They don't feel real. They feel robotic, out of touch with the way people act in their everyday life. There are so many cringe lines in his writing that sometimes come out of nowhere. I can't forget this vomit-worthy moment in the movie Interstellar. I'm talking about the ""love transcends dimensions"" scene. That is more painful to me than the slow-motion moments in the Indian telenovelas. But it seems that the average audience has no problem with Nolan's lovey-dovey touch on the dialogue.Tenet is nothing new in terms of how Nolan approached the storytelling/plot-structure. Here Nolan decides to keep us in the dark for a bit more than usual, and I think that's what drags this film down. If we would have known more about the characters and about what this story is about from the very beginning, we'd have felt for the characters more. We get to know everything only later on in the film, when Nolan explains in luxurious details, as always. Nolan doesn't believe much in his audience. It's like he creates these very complex stories about scientific stuff, and then he sits down and thinks: ""Oh wait, I'm not making this movie only for the people who have a Ph.D. in physics."" And then, in his attempt to make his movies accessible for broader audiences, he ruins them a bit.What I liked here were the mesmerizing color palettes. I think that the color palettes in most of Nolan's films (Dunkirk excluded) are a bit messy, not very well thought-out, but here they are very alluring. I liked the whole look of the film and the vibe of the images. Also, the score is almost as good as in any other Nolan film. Ludwig Göransson was very important in giving Nolan a better grip on the overall theme of the film. The score is gripping, suspenseful, and exciting. Yet another exceptional piece for Göransson to add to his body of work.I am very disappointed. I was hoping for Nolan to keep up at least close to the level of Dunkirk, but nope, he goes old Nolan here again. He went back at the Nolan that strikes for grand audiences by being politically correct and sentimental in the cheesiest way. Yes, those are the two most important details for a blockbuster movie, Nolan style.",Tenet

877,kooldddon,Another headbanging experience,10,4 December 2020,"Trust Nolan to use this medium to amalgamate time, story, space, emotion, reality and idea and just dish out a thorough blockbuster. And he does that with aplomb again. I wasn't much too impressed with his last venture Dunkirk. But as it is with every Nolan film, it's not much about the story he sells but the entire experience of watching it on the big screen. And boy o boy Tenet does that. Armed with a story of altering reality and time with the usual 'save the world' plot, Tenet follows protagonist (Washington) on a journey to prevent WW3. Pretty standard Nolan stuff happens, time and realities begin to mix up making it tougher for the audience to grasp what is happening. There are a couple of dialogues certain characters mouth, ""Don't try to understand it, just feel it."" Follwed by one towards the end, ""If you can't stop thinking about time in linear sense, this is not for you."" These 2 dialogues should pretty much sum up the film for you. Because one will understand the story after multiple watches, or if you are lazy you will just google 'Tenet explained'. But there is no fun it. Trust me, there is no fun in googling the answer instead of watching it and rewatching it again to understand a Nolan film piece by piece.Now the acting by the lead cast of Washington, Pattinson and Elizabeth are decent. I have seen them perform better. They do the job well. The tight screenplay does allow them to mask some shortcomings. Dimple Kapadia has a very good role, it's not a 2 min dash and she has ample amount of dialogues but I just didn't feel her enough radiate through the screen. Music is definitely the highlight of the film, Ludwig Göransson is a freakin' genius. The entire film reverbs and vibes on a different level as soon as his BG score begins. My heart literally thumps and I got goosebumps whenever any music erupted. Editing is top notch again by Jennifer Lame. I mean to edit a Nolan film is no easy task. The film is tightly edited, there are no bogged down moments. You will always be on your toes and figuring out what will happen. That's where Nolan's writing also shines. To be actually fair, the music, editing and camera (Hoyte van Hoytema) lifts Nolan's screenplay several notches.Tenet is something that has to be experienced on the big IMAX screen. I don't think so it will be the same when you watch it on your tv and laptop. It's a wholesome experience. As it goes 'don't try to understand it, feel it.'",Tenet

I've also seen a few that just blow your mind. Tenet is definitely a blow your mind one. Good job Mr. Nolan. Best one since Interstellar. I hope you find another good scifi concept to do.

Nevertheless, I was able to get the bigger picture and the action scenes and the effects were done amazingly. So, I actually did enjoy it on my first watch, but still I thought that some parts were missing. That's probably because I didn't expect such a complicated movie and when I realized it, it was kind of too late. And the fact that Tenet hits the ground running from the get-go didn't help.But, here comes the interesting part.Something told me to wait some time and give it a second shot.

882,mha-89327,An Over Ambitous Failed Attempt At Trying to Be Clever and Entertaining,6,5 February 2021,"Tenet is a movie driven by the fame and popularity of its creator's prior successful productions. However, evaluating this production on its own merits, there is little to justify such vested enthusiasm or expectation. Rather, the plotline is a fragmented and dizzying stream of action sequences which leaves the viewer wanting to hit the pause button, or wishing to flee for the exit.Tenet as a story is just too much of too much. Structurally, a single premise, merges into a multitude of dependent sub-plots, all driven by a mechanism which can affect time reversal. Thus, shooting a time-reversal-bullet at glass affects events starting from their logical end then regressing backwards.Thereby, scenes become confounded as characters simultaneously experience and interact with a scenario moving, respectively, and interactively, forward (normally) and backwards in time. This produces a visual spaghetti. While clever in conception, visually and semantically it successfully only produces confusion. Further, this narrative device is a poor tool for advancing the storyline. It is just too complex and technical for any real fulfilling sense of story progression.Consequently, this movie is a concept, and execution of an idea, which just does not reproduce well on screen. Essentially, the viewer merely is exposed to a sequence of streaming scene changes which are justified in pursuit of a single allegedly important aim. Frankly, I just did not care by the time I was half was through the movie. The characters were robbed on an opportunity to make any real visceral impact or connection with the audience. The action scenes themselves were the primary protagonist through the production, the characters, the story, and the objective all seemed to become, secondary.This production, for me, felt like a preview of a previously rejected iteration of a motion picture still in production and awaiting proper creative direction and infusion. Disappointing. Tiresome and uninspiring. What potential remained with the creative inspiration behind this movie was lost in mindless semantics and visual technological soup. Sorry, no. It was just wrong and wholly unpleasant to engage with.",Tenet

I think you should just lay back and enjoy the action, it is a quite catastrophic, long and strange film.The movie is overall pretty confusing but good, the music is loud and a lot of bass, but it fits, most of Nolan's films have intense crazy music that mostly fit the scenes in the movies great.

886,FattyBoomBatty,Visually spectacular,8,6 September 2020,"As well as being visually spectacular, as only Nolan knows how, and married to amazing music, the characters I thought were really well developed (though my wife would disagree).The sound track is intense with gun shots that actually sound loud compared to the dialogue, (which in so many films has been compressed to death to the point everything sounds as loud/quiet as everything else and all sense of dynamics has been lost). Also the vocals are reasonably coherent by the standard of Nolan movies, so do expect some mumble. Music-wise the ratcheting synths/samplers, fluid time signatures and dramatic composition make me think Nolan has found another composer for when Zimmer is busy.The plot requires some suspension of belief and after reading previous reviews I was quite please with myself to get 3/4 of the way through stage and still understand what was going on, however the last 20 mins threw me a curve ball.

It's like they had some good ideas for 10 minutes of action but no idea how to string them together.
I must however address the background score. I assume applied by a child. No consideration of the tone of the film and swamping the dialogue. An awful synthetic noise almost randomly distributed across throughout the film. It really put me off and will state it is the worse background score I have ever heard.
Chris Nolan has a tendency to be a bit arty-farty in his work, but he misses the point here.
They released this during the Covid pandemic to redraw people back to the cinema and keep the film industry alive. They should have chosen a more crowd drawing title me thinks.

892,Theodor16,Soulless piece of action,3,28 November 2020,"When you substract the incessant action scenes, the CGI and the quickly-thrown-in dialogs that have no permittance to linger, this movie leaves you with an empty stomach and an ADHD sickness. Don't look for anything scientific or any further ramifications from the gimick with the time inversion, it's just an unexplored idea to make the movie sound interesting.

893,srdikano,A misfire for Nolan,4,19 February 2021,"This movie has a laundry list of problems: script, plot, pacing, acting, casting and a thoroughly disappointing ending being but a few of them.I gladly give Nolan a pass though. He tried something innovative and creative and, this time, it didn't quite pan out.",Tenet
894,jdowney-57-371157,This Movie is Really Bad.,2,2 April 2021,"As has been noted. The sound is bad. Hard to understand what half the characters are saying. And what they are saying is further impeded by not making that much sense. The music for the action scenes is also bad. Mostly bad techno beat music, but just found it overdone and annoying.The story is bad. A Secret Agent from the CIA is pulled into a giant conspiracy that requires a James Bondian world-traveling super spy to act based upon a mostly unknown set of facts with the feeling he is being manipulated. There is a woman for whom he develops feelings towards. And she is married to the bad guy. And the Bad guy controls her as ruthlessly as he does everything else. Ya..nothing new here.So, he / now they travel from action scene to action scene. This means some car chases, big explosions, etc. One super contrived scene has to do with a bunch of vehicles surrounding another vehicle to trap it so they can do break into it. Just have seen it before and it was so obvious it is remarkable the bad guys didn't see it coming.Kenneth Branaugh overacts as the bad russian guy. The hero, JD Washington, is badly miscast. He lacks any physical presence. He can't act. (Check out the lame climax scene where he tries to talk the bad guy into not ending the world....really truly bad). He has no chemistry with the heroine (Elizabeth Debicki), who towers over him. Robert Pattinson is another really over-rated actor, here he babbles about time travel and its implications. He seems bored mostly. Michael Caine in three minutes of screen time acted rings around everyone else in this cast.In the final third of the movie, it turns out the bad guy is dying from cancer, suddenly. So that somehow explains his behavior. I mean, WTF?I don't want to tell you the plot, which is convoluted by itself, but I will tell you that every convenient thing that needs to happen at the time it needs to happen, happens.Very rarely does a movie with this many big action scenes seem boring, but this one manages it.I truly thought 'Monster Hunters' was better than this.",Tenet

898,TheDragonTrader,Overshooting an incredible concept,7,15 April 2021,"In a modern opera building, the orchestra is tuning and the final guests are being seated. As the director tells everyone to be quiet with one gesture... a shot is fired! Unknown soldiers terrorize the audience and the musicians. Other soldiers, who were waiting outside, barge in and pump the opera hall full of gas. One by one the audience falls asleep. But the attackers came prepared and put on their gasmasks. We follow one of the soldiers as he finds a man in a lodge and uses a code phrase to identify himself. They jump down just as someone starts firing at them. As they try to get away, one of the attackers realises this soldier is not one of them. We see bombs with timers, a bullet that's reversed and what looks like a weird thin can.Yes, this is very much like an opening scene from James Bond, which - as I understand it - was Christopher Nolan's intention. The concept of this film is absolutely thrilling and well thought of: time inversion. It makes for an incredibly creative and striking visual experience.John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh fill the screen with nothing more than decent performances, but when your character doesn't even have a name, I get it that it isn't self-evident to put down a top-notch acting performance. Michael Caine is sadly wasted, for he's only seen in one single scene. The soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson is clever, using reversed pieces of music when appropriate, but misses finesse and memorability. The rest of the production design, cinematography etc. Is exquisitely put together.The biggest problem of this movie is it's tempo. The first part of this movie moves too fast. We are being bombed with dialogue-heavy scenes that try to explain the plot and what's at stake, but we are not given the time to let things sink in. Then the middle part does all the justice to Nolan's genius it can with clever uses of the concept and exhilarating action sequences. After which the finale is so bombastic and chaotic that it is hard to tell who is who is where is moving in what direction and why this or that fits together with what's at stake.Tenet is a thrilling, fast moving, action movie that is more than pleasing to be sure. I fear, however, it will lose much of its entertainment value when played outside of movie theatres. It's also not Nolan's best work. Great fun, great concept, great execution, but not quite a ""great"" film.",Tenet
899,MovieSoup,A hard watch but enjoyable.,7,19 January 2021,"I, like many, have had to watch this movie a few times to really get a sense of what this film is actually about. Now I stress that this is a masterful movie in the casting, cinematography, directing and technical sense. Nolan knows exactly whta he is doing and works with only the best actors/film producers to make his films really stand out amidst the awful films that have been coming out in recent memory.
However the reason I'm hesitant about giving this a higher rating is mostly down to the plot of the film itself, I just find it needlessly complicated and hard to follow in a quite a few places. The plot of this film just doesn't suit me as I belive all of the truly great and timeless films are ones that have a simple plot that gets straight to the point. Whilst watching this film all I could think about was the saying ""brevity is the soul of wit"".
I think that the plot of Tenet will be pored over by many and some will try to pass it off as a intellectual powerhouse of a film however the truth is that most average joe's will find it unneccesary confusing and slow paced.
In conclusion I think that it is a stunningly technical, masterful film with one of the most flawed and convoluted plots in film history.",Tenet
900,benmundie,Very Interesting Despite the Confusion,9,8 September 2020,"Tenet is the newest movie from legendary director Christopher Nolan who delivers the intricacy of the story that he brings to all of his other films. The concept itself displays what Nolan does best which is swinging for the fences and it pays off once more. I can guarantee this is something you have never seen before. The plot is full of twists and turns which work because of the stellar acting from John David-Washington (the Protagonist), Robert Pattinson (Neil) and Kenneth Branagh (Andrei Sator) and the writing by Nolan himself. The mix between practical effects and CGI work perfectly together and they blend really well. The score is brilliant and exactly what you can expect from Oscar winner Ludwig Göransen, it is perfect for the story they're telling and I'm sure it will bring more awards his way. The film never lets up and the pace is rapid with the audience having to pay full attention at all times. The decision to not give the main character an actual name is perfect and explains what the organisation (Tenet) is to the viewer in a very subtle way.
Overall, I loved this film, for sure parts of it were confusing but it is still an incredibly entertaining ride which I highly recommend to anyone who loves to watch something they have never seen before.",Tenet
901,Gatsby81,"Great Story, weak main actor",7,4 April 2021,Nolan is a genius as everybody knows. The story is great and I was surprised of Pattinson. But the main actor Washington was definitely a wrong choice for a blockbuster movie.

I will watch it at least once more and may well up my rating.I agree with some of the feedback already given,
the Movie was very loud, and during some scenes I actually had to cover my ears and I could still hear everything I needed.During other scenes the dialogue was mumbled and I couldn't hear it, this is common in Hollywood now though, I reflected on watching movies at home on demand where I can rewind or even switch on subtitles briefly, not wanting to miss important information, or possibly I'm going deaf because of paragraph 2, above.I felt the story was interesting and unique, looking forward to understanding it more, wish there was still IMDb discussion forums, would love to hear other people's opinions and theories",Tenet
907,ksb77,Pretentious !,5,27 August 2020,Looks like people are just saying this is fantastic based on the name of Christopher Nolan. He's a fantastic filmmaker and has made some brilliant films. This ain't one of them. A very pretentious movie that's beautifully shot with an excellent thumping soundtrack. However it feels unnecessarily complex with a lot of exposition none of which explains anything making you think you missed something. Well you didn't it's just designed to make you think you did. You may feel thick with a need to rewatch but if you think about it the plot is not that complicated. It's just put together in a fragmented way. Performance wise Washington Is good but not consistently brilliant throughout. Patterson lacks something and the posh British accent is a bit fake. Kenneth Is alright nothing special going on with him either. Aaron (kick ass) looked like he didn't really care delivering his lines like he was in a hurry to go home. After this I watched 'Unhinged' enjoyed it much more plus Russell Crowe was horribly awesome. Take care folks ...,Tenet
908,hakan_respect,"""don't try to understand it, feel it""",7,28 August 2020,"I have seen Tenet on IMAX as always I prefer to watch his movies on IMAX. I avoided spoilers before I watch the movie in this sense I'm lucky. Since I have seen the first trailer my hype increased. After I heard news about the movie like flowing of time backward , it worried and excited me at same time. After I have seen the movie 2 days ago, I feel I have seen good movie but not as good as Inception.
I really liked the action of the movie and tone of the was very satisfying, you nearly never get bored of the movie however its long runtime around 2 hours 30 minutes. Nolan's whatever is possible don't use CGI policy works in this movie too. They really crashed a real plane as you can see in the 2nd the trailer.(may be the in the last trailer). Ludwig Göransson did a good with soundtracks as you know Hans Zimmer was not in this movie as composer because of the scheduling conflicts. Nolan again uses complicated storytelling it is as ambitious as Inception but it was not as impressive as Inception. There some things I really haven't liked in the movie. In some scenes dialogues are cut short and sometimes can't be heard clearly because of the intensity of soundtrack. Going back time was very confusing and it also resembles parallel universes like in a film named ""Dejavu"" which is starring Denzel Washington. Whether coincidentally or not Denzel Washington's son John David Washington is the protagonist of the movie.
Future generation's role was ridiculous and they sent Tenet to destroy humanity. The villain's motivations are very ridiculous to help future generations. He is also very straightforward and cliche however Kenneth Branagh's performance is very good. I really didn't like godlike power of future generation and the villain simply it didn't work for me.Briefly, It is a solid action/sci-fi movie it sometimes is confusing but as a characters says ""If you don't try to understand and try to feel it"" it is a good movie. Although character development lacks in the movie performances of the cast was very good. Washington, Branagh, Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki gave good performances. It may not be a masterpiece but it is a damn good movie that you'll watch at least more than 2 times.",Tenet
909,miromoman,Inconsistently dumb,4,10 December 2020,"Let's say that Inception was an overhyped but interesting barrel with three big holes. Then this thing would be a huge hole with a couple of interesting barrels floating here and there.I wasted the painful two hours and a half hoping it was going to get better. It does not.The marketing trick is that you are supposed to feel stupid if you do not understand it. The reality is that it is precisely when you understand it when you realise how dumb and inconsistent it is.That said, it would not be so extremely annoying if it was not so pretentious. It could in fact become a decent parody of itself.The bottom line: boring and hollow.",Tenet
910,felix-wyderka,Tenet is a typical Nolan movie with an entertaining and highly confusing plot,7,31 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan is a director who often splits viewers. He has his unique take on things and his movies are often highly complex and require the audience's full attention.
Movies like ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" are proof that Nolan knows how to use special effects and a complex plot and make it watchable and highly interesting. They also give the impression that Nolan has a very big interest in time and time travel.
When I first heard of ""Inception"" a few years ago many people told me that it is confusing and unwatchable. Now I think it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the last decade.
Nolan is a very capable director and someone who trusts his fans to understand his motives and ideas. I am a supporter, if not a fan, but Nolan's newest film ""Tenet"" is more complex and, at times, confusing than even ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"" might have been.
""Tenet"" deals with time and time travel in a most creative yet peculiar way that I could not possibly explain to you here for it would take too long. The gist of it is that objects are inverted. If objects can move along in time with us they can also move backward. If that sounds ominous and confusing to you, don't worry it is all explained in extreme detail in the movie.
The movie wastes no time and starts with an assault on an opera where a target must be eliminated by a Special-OPs commando. The main character, throughout the movie only known as The Protagonist, is played perfectly by John David Washington. The Protagonist tries to save the target and gets captured and tortured. He takes a cyanide capsule, like he was taught, and awakes just to find he has been promoted, kind of. The Protagonist is taken to a facility where he is introduced to the concept of inverted objects. He is shown bullets that travel back in time and is told to investigate where these bullets come from.
Along the way, he teams up with the mysterious Neil (Robert Pattinson) who has been sent to assist him and they track the weapons back to a Russian arms dealer named Andrej (Kenneth Branagh). The Protagonist decides to get close to Andrej though his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Kat is being blackmailed by her abusive husband to stay with him, by threats that she will lose her son if she tried to leave.
The rest of the movie the Protagonist and his team try to figure out Andrej's motives and how to stop him.
""Tenet"" has a lot of dialogue and spends a lot of time telling us what's going on and why. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but after an hour it gets a little tedious and I wished Nolan would just let the movie speak for itself. The plot is hard to follow as it is and even all the explanation of the confusing time travel doesn't make it better.
I know this is what most Nolan fans like, those confusing twisted plots but I for one prefer a straight-lined plot that has emotional depth, thrilling action scenes, and emotional stakes. I am missing all this here.
The action sequences, as in all of Nolan's movies, are state of the art and the incredible cinematography and editing make the movie fast-paced and exciting. I would have liked to see more of that.
Hoyte van Hoytema is a regular Nolan collaborator and one of the best cinematographers in the world. His incredible wide shots and color schemes make the action sequences glow with excitement.
Luckily Nolan chose very fine actors to compensate for the confusing story.
Washington is one of the best actors around right now. He has so much depth in his performances that it is easy to root for him.
Pattinson, who I have never considered a great actor, has really shown a lot of good performances in the last few years. He is charming as Neil the mysterious but smart and capable partner of The Protagonist. He has come a long way since the Twilight movies and with his British charm, there are few bigger roles in the future that would suit well (I am thinking of a British secret agent that will need a new face soon).
I don't know how many people know Kenneth Branagh in the USA outside Hollywood but I know he is a big deal in Britain and rightly so. He is one of the most underrated actors and just when you might have forgotten about he turns up and delivers another splendid performance.
I admire the boldness and creativity Nolan put into ""Tenet"" but he got a little overenthusiastic throughout the movie.
Nevertheless, ""Tenet"" is an entertaining movie that requires your full attention but comes to a satisfactory ending. It is full of Nolan's trademarks and after you decide to just enjoy the plot and go with the whole time-traveling concept you will definitely find this movie very entertaining.
I for one will have to watch the movie a few more times to properly understand it but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.",Tenet

912,nicolasmaczk,Nolan at it's lowest isn't too bad,6,30 November 2020,"I absolutely love Nolan's work, usually, this one, however... Not so much. I couldn't follow 80% of the movie, and not for the reasons you might think. Every dialog in the movie is annoyingly mumbled, and this is not to help a ""plot"" that's supposed to be complex. There's some clever editing that tries to make you ""feel"" that the consequences precedes the causes, like when the protagonist shots a ""reverse"" gun for the first time he has almost no reaction, but when he tries the second time, he's surprised. Unfortunately, it feels more like bad acting than a clever move, I like the idea, but the execution should have been thought over more deeply. The concept is real good though, but it felt way to hard to be translated on screen, what a shame. Maybe a re-editing could make it better, but who knows at this point.",Tenet
913,lvanderwindt,A masterpiece,10,27 August 2020,"Wow, that is to be honest the only word that can describe this movie. I had heard so much about it, from the behind the scenes to all of the info about the actors, so when i went to the cinema i had high hopes. This movie started with immediate action, Nolan draws the attention to the viewer, which i love. Through the first half of the film Christopher Nolan just throws the viewers through the whole storyline. He decides when you get to understand stuff and when you cannot. It's only in the second half that things actually start to make sense, for a lot of people this is not an exciting way of filmmaking because you don't really know what's going on but i would simply say 'ignorance is our munition' because you know so little about the whole story in the beginning you're really getting on the edge of your seat. You couldn't possibly know what was going happen next. And i got the feeling that when The Protagonist fully understood it, so did I. John Washington did the most amazing job, just like Robert Pattinson. The way both of these actors played together was immaculate. I loved every second of the screen time they had together, the slight ominous feeling mixed with a little humour and a small doubt in trust for each other really did it for me. Kenneth Branagh's screenplay was also so good, he is such an amazing actor. Elizabeth Debicki was such a good character, she played her role really well, she was such an intimidating character until she was with her husband, then she would crawl up into this little ball al to protect her son. I could've not suspected anything else from Christopher Nolan but the cinematography was out of this world, the way of filming was so mesmerising, the long moving shots were so beautifully made. The way how the first half was so played in onto the second half was the best part for me personally. You'd look at all these loose ends at the beginning but didn't really pay attention to it because the storyline was so complex, you barely had any time to pay attention to anything else. You feel so stupid because in the second half it all starts to make sense. Him fighting with himself, him driving the car, him being hurt in his arm. Small details that made the movie so much better. I also loved the music, Nolan sometimes uses so little music and other times such barbaric tones, i personally love it. I notice that most of the time in Nolans films he barely uses any music in dramatic moments, such as fighting scenes or emotional ones. It's honestly so much different and i'm here for it. This movie is a masterpiece and i'd definitely watch it again!",Tenet
914,LansTaylor,Good but could've been great,7,7 September 2020,"The concept of going forward and backwards was really interesting and I throughly enjoyed how they made it happen on screen. The plane crash, to me, was very underwhelming from when I originally heard that Nolan wanted to crash (another) a plane. But then it went backwards and I was amazed for what I just saw. The whole fight scene from the Protagonist the first time was really cool but the second time in reverse was even better considering that he knew the moves he used the first time and was countering everything. 10/10 cinematography.
The plot, on the other hand, was kinda boring but I guess it could have something to do with me not being able to hear what the characters were saying a lot of the time; I think Christopher Nolan may be going deaf.
The score by Ludwig Goransonn was off the charts. That opening scene in the opera was so intense and the score really set the mood and tempo for what was about to take place.
If there's one thing that you can expect in cinema, it's that Nolan will always give you a kick ass intro.
Overall, the movie was more on of the side on interesting and visually stunning than good. I would 100% watch it again with subtitles.",Tenet

916,j889,Robert Pattinson's Performance Prompted Me to Write Review,5,26 September 2021,"The dialog and the music are just awful. This film is terrible with out Hans Zimmer. The music director is terrible. Robert Pattinson is probably the only good thing coming out of this film. The film is awfully complex and confusing. The plot is somewhat tedious if you really think about it. It is a logic mess. Christopher Nolan utilize a simple concept (time travel again, and traveling backwards) into a needlessly, tried-to-be mind-blowing film (like Inception), which he failed. The film is about beautiful bro-love. Neil loves Protagonist, and ultimately he dies for him (or the mission, but you have got to love someone to die for him, right?).John David Washington's performance as the protagonist is just boring. He's emotionless. Christopher Nolan put John David Washington there just to ride on the BLM movement of Hollywood. You see more acting from Dimple Kapadia, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Robert Pattinson. Personally, Robert Pattinson's performance really shined, and it prompted me to check out his other films (minus Twilight). The protagonist is not the protagonist, in many ways, Pattinson is.If you have watched some of Christopher Noland's films, Tenet is quite easy to understand.

Sad to say -- and I have a very open mind when it comes to new sci-fi -- it fails immensely in those expectations.First, the story creeps along at pace slower than a turtle, never really giving its viewer a reason to get hooked into it.Second, and the biggest disappointment, the ""special ability"", the superpower are so poorly explained that you never -- and I mean NEVER -- truly understand how it works, what triggers it in one instance and not another, and so on. It's like ""Wow, check out this visual effect, and don't ask why!"" Thus when the effect happens it's impossible to know why it happened, what you can predict from it happening, and you just get pissed or worse, bored, with it all.I stopped watching with only 20 minutes left in the film. That should say it all. I tried to hold on, but finally was so insulted by the poor storytelling that I gave up not even caring what ultimately happened in the end.",Tenet

925,Paradroid78,"One point for good acting, another for looking pretty",2,3 January 2021,"As someone who really enjoyed other Nolan movies like The Dark Knight, and Interstellar, this movie is just categorically bad.It's basically a bland James Bond knock-off with a secret agent taking on a villain on a yacht, except there's a confusing time travel gimmick meaning the characters sometimes move backwards in time instead of forwards. The way the movie presents this is complete and utter nonsense, but fine let's suspend our disbelief.When I say confusing, the reason is not that it's a particularly hard concept to grasp (it's not), but because the film goes out of its way to make it difficult to understand. First of all, all the dialog is muffled so if you want to understand more than the occasional word you have to watch it with subtitles. Then when you watch it with subtitles, you realize why they muffled the dialog - it's because it mostly consists of incomprehensible gibberish.After a lot of meandering and the occasional set piece, this all this culminates in a badly choreographed big battle scene where the movie fails to actually show you who the good guys are fighting against, making the whole thing look like a live fire exercise instead of an actual battle.By this point though it's hard to care anyway. Even though the acting is as good as you'd expect, there's little character development and once you strip the time travel gimmick away, the plot boils down to a straight forward hunt for a McGuffin.Wished I'd followed my instincts and stopped watching before I got to the end.",Tenet
926,mohammedsalehali99,Confusing Masterpiece.,8,11 December 2020,"It's really hard to give this movie a review just from the first watch. I've yet to rewatch the movie but here are my first impressions.
Overall, Tenet is a great movie. This might be Christopher Nolan's boldest movie in terms of complexity, it makes Inception and interstellar look like child's play.
The idea behind this movie is pure genius. The problem is that the movie is very complicated and really hard to understand. You'll most likely spend most of your time confused, having no idea what's happening and why.
The movie doesn't do a good job at explaining what's going on or why it's happening.
The soundtrack is really good as usual with Nolan's movies.
I honestly didn't like John David Washington as the protagonist, I thought his acting was a bit poor compared to the others. Pattinson and Debicki are both great.
You might begin to understand the movie after a while but by then it would be too late.
This movie definitely demands a second watch and full concentration.
Even though I didn't fully understand it, I knew that I saw something incredible, I just have to fill in the blanks to fully get the Tenet experience.
Well done, Christopher Nolan.",Tenet

Every few minutes I had to stop and rewind and kept rewinding some parts over and over trying to understand what was happening. I also had closed captioning on but was still left confused. What a bummer. I had really looking forward to this movie.I was also rather disappointed in the protagonist - John David Washington. He was not expressive, didn't show enough depth, and sometimes seemed awkward delivering his lines. I don't think he was able to carry this movie on his shoulders. (Even though he does have quite strong shoulders! - as we were certain to notice from his 2 pull-up scenes. Seriously, an aerial shot of him doing pull-ups on a massive tanker ship!? Come on, we get it, John David Washington is very fit guy.) I'm happy that the main character wasn't the standard white dude, but I can think of a number of other guys who could've done a better job (Idris Elba, Will Smith, Bokeem Woodbine....). On the other hand, I have been very impressed with Robert Pattinson over the years. He stole every scene that he was in.I enjoy getting lost in movies, but this was the wrong kind of lost.

939,RayCharles81,Your Future Self is Going to Return to Rate This Higher if You Didn't Like It Your First Time Through; It's Way Better Than What the Negative Reviews Have Summated,8,9 September 2020,"Do not listen to the negative reviews; that's what I did when I just glanced at them prior to viewing it. My expectations were incredibly low as a result, but by the end of the movie I literally felt like this was easily the best film I've seen in at least 4 years- again, easily.Many of the negative reviewers will return with their future self inverted to change their ratings once they better understand the movie. Some of the most regurgitated arguments are simply untrue. They may sound good and may appear true on a superficial viewing, but once you really grasp what everything means, some of the most popular critiques fall apart.I actually want to go back and check out every negative reviewer's other reviews and see what movies in recent years they are raving about and rating higher than this and how they are criticizing this. In fact, I did that with a few of them, and just as expected, they rate some real stinkers and dumbed down popcorn flicks higher than this one, to say the least.Furthermore, I mean, let's all look at the last 4 years of movies that have garnered critical acclaim of any widespread consensus or that has been nominated for awards; think about the movies that have received high overall grades and ratings in the last five years. If you are honest they are all stinkers and pretentiously and desperately overrated. ""3 Billboards....""? ""The Shape of Water""? This is just to name a few of the forgettable, but overrated and overrewarded movies in the last several years. Most people will never rewatch these movies again, including ""1917"" and for many, even the well-made ""Parasite"", which admittedly was a pretty good movie.What Nolan has done here is returned filmmaking to the ""classics""- movies you want to rewatch over and over again. I've already watched this movie 2 times, and I am looking forward to watching it again. It's so well-made it is arguably a masterpiece.While the mumbling and slurring of the English language was definitely confusing enough by several of the actors (honestly, thank God for the lead actor Washington because if it wasn't for his clear English dialogue, I wouldn't have been able to hear or comprehend most conversations at all), the biggest issue I had was regarding how they were able to time travel in the final action scene.Earlier in the film, they show the portal that allowed them to invert themselves so clearly that was the mechanism and appeared to be the only mechanism to do it. But toward the end of the movie, people and characters are time traveling it seems at different locations without seeing them enter the portal. I suppose you are supposed to just assume they used the portal, but there was no clear explanation of how they got to those locations.Another issue that should also be touched on is how the significant lines of dialogue that may help expand on the stakes or consequences of the time travel are spoken so quickly (and then completely abandoned and forgotten about).Speaking of which, the girl, after being ordered not to do something ends up doing it anyway. I thought that was weird that they had her potentially ruin the mission on impulse. It seemed like it didn't totally fit the narrative to that point. She could (and should have) ruined the mission, but only a second later, it didn't even matter anyway. Anyway, the point is, this movie has some flaws and some inconsistencies so it is not a perfect movie from a writing or narrative standpoint.However, with all of that being said, I enjoyed all of the special effects, the acting was very good, the directing was good, the action scenes were fun, the overall idea and concept was cool and more intriguing than I expected it to be, and the music was solid.It's probably a solid 7/10 movie, but out of sheer ambition and mind-****ery attempted to get you to think and analyze which is unique and unconventional for a summer action blockbuster, I'll give it an 8/10 based on that entertainment experience.Also, should note: this has many similarities ironically at times to the The Dark Knight Rises, but also Memento elements. Finally, definitely an Unpopular Opinion, but I easily liked this movie more than Inception.",Tenet

951,jacobsperling,There will never be anything like it again.,10,1 October 2020,"I finally got to see Tenet last night (and in IMAX, no less), in an enormous AMC that had 10 out of 125 seats filled.And, holy smokes, my mind is STILL spinning.This is a phenomenal film. Christopher Nolan is an absolute genius-there is almost no way any film of this kind will be made again, no matter what you think of the film itself. It is enormously complex, and there is no possible way to understand all of the film without seeing it more than once (or at the very least, seeing it only once it is released online/on DVD with the subtitles on and slowing down and analyzing the scenes where the rules of the film's world are explained). But the amazing way Tenet succeeds is that if you actually sit down (with a piece of paper or a laptop) and write out the rules of time that Nolan sets for this world, the film makes sense. There are no plot holes, no ""but according to this, then that scene doesn't make sense"", no cheap tricks that the movie pulls for convenience. None. It is absolutely masterful.The acting is superb. John David Washington gives a controlled, smooth, very well-balanced performance as The Protagonist (and while it may seem weird and annoying that no name is given, it's extremely clever how the film almost seems to poke fun at the audience for this-he's asked ""Who are you?"" or ""Mr...?"" several times, never giving a straight answer once), Robert Pattinson blends into his role as The Protagonist's partner (or more accurately, his ""handler"", as the espionage world goes) and physics expert with an assuredness that makes you wonder how the heck he possibly managed to understand half of what he was talking about, and Elizabeth Debicki fits the part of Kat (art dealer, and more importantly, the estranged wife of Branagh's terrifying villain) supremely. But it would be shameful not to give a special mention to Kenneth Branagh; his performance as Andre Sator-an immeasurably powerful, merciless Russian oligarch and Kat's husband-is unbelievable. There are shots of his face that filled the 70x50 foot screen last night that would send chills down one's spine; he is brutal, terrifying, and extremely intelligent (Branagh's best performance in a decade). The rest of the cast, from Clemence Poesy to Michael Caine to Martin Donovan, play their roles perfectly.Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is spectacular. It is quite possibly the best of the year (the movie should definitely been seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX), throwing you into the midst of the action while still being beautifully vivid, detailed and meticulous. I was worried about Lee Smith (Nolan's brilliant editor for every one of his films since Batman Begins) not being available for this one (although, in fairness, he was unavailable because he was doing last year's masterpiece ""1917""-enough said), but Jennifer Lame was up to the task, doing a brilliant job all the way through. Ludwig Goransson's score really grew on me-it's pulse-pounding, yet emotional when it needs to be; on the whole, it makes one feel as if they are in the film itself (that score of his being played over that wide-angle shot of the 747-holy smokes).I have seen people complaining that the sound mixing was unclear. This is untrue-it is hard to make out the dialogue at times, but the reason for that is because in several scenes (notably the opening 10 minutes, which are absolutely incredible), the characters are masked, and while we can hear their voices just fine, it's hard to make out what they're saying without subtitles; while this may be a difficulty for first time viewers in the audience, it's not a flaw in the filmmaking.It is, yet again, sheer mastery from the greatest living director and screenwriter alive, one Christopher Nolan. He is simply on another level. The enormous dedication and effort he puts into his films is jaw-droppingly phenomenal, especially in this day and age (when things have unfortunately become all about money, cheapness and wokeness), with real, true, quality filmmaking almost nonexistent. It is because of filmmakers like Nolan that movies of this caliber still exist. His otherworldly direction, writing, and attention to every minor detail are on full display (once again) in this masterpiece.Make no mistake about it: Tenet is unlike anything ever made, and the likes of which nothing will probably ever be made again. Aside from that, it is an astonishing work of art.",Tenet
952,sebastianschlicht,"Despite the ambitious idea, Nolan's film seems limited!",6,4 September 2020,"First of all: No spoilers!Christopher Nolan is one of the few remaining directors who make independent, original films with little CGI and thus attract masses of viewers to the cinema. I'm no exception either. Nolan could show me a two-minute trailer from a simple meadow and I would run to the cinema! Now it is the case that his latest film ""Tenet"" from 2020 is more than just a new, spectacular action film: Since march the corona virus has influenced everything in the world, including cinemas of course. Release dates have been delayed and especially the big movies like ""Black Widow"" and ""Tenet"" are in great demand. Now Nolan and Warner Bros. decided to reopen the world of cinema with one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year.
As expected, I was very interested in this work, so far I have really enjoyed all of Nolan's films and have been entertained and touched by these in a special way. Unfortunately, ""Tenet"" is something ""special"" in this respect: I left the cinema disappointed and confused. On the one hand, ""Tenet"" is certainly one of the most impressive films of the last few years, but the rest left me pretty perplexed and empty ...A CIA agent gets a very strange job called ""Tenet"". He learns that there are so-called ""inverted"" objects that move back in time. He is supposed to get to the bottom of the matter and quickly realizes that the whole thing is bigger than initially assumed ...I don't want to reveal much more, because the story is mostly a secret and that's always a good thing in my opinion. And to say it straight away: ""Tenet"" is one of those films that will polarize a lot. Some will love it and celebrate it as a masterpiece, others will shake their heads confused. Unfortunately I belong to the second group, although I have to admit that this film might get better with time (I know, pun!). At the moment I have to say that ""Tenet"" is Nolan's weakest film for me.Why is that? First of all, ""Tenet"" is without a doubt breathtaking from a technical standpoint. Nolan is notorious for using as little CGI as possible. For this he is valued and respected. And here, too, his talent shows when it comes to staging spectacular action. The mix of backwards and forwards running images is unique in its presentation. ""Tenet"" is without a doubt one of the most impressive films of the last few years and for me it definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for the cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema was responsible for this, who has worked with Nolan since ""Interstellar"") or the set-design.
This time the score was not composed by Hans Zimmer, but by Ludwig Göransson, who already surprised me very positively with ""Black Panther"". However, his work is hardly inferior to that of Zimmer. Its soundtrack is impressive and has melodies running backwards over and over again, which fits perfectly into the concept of the film.In terms of sound, however, I have to criticize a few things: Not only is the music mixed very loudly, but above all the sound effects are in the foreground. Nolan has been doing this for many of his films, but it has never been as exhausting as it is here. Dialogues disappear in the noise and the performance in our cinema in particular was absolute horror! We had to cover our ears in the action scenes, that's ridiculous. But of course that could be more due to the cinema than to the film ...Let´s get to my main problem of the film: The empty and overly complex story. Nolan's brother Jonathan wrote the script for his movies up to ""Interstellar"". Since then, Christopher Nolan has been working alone in the scriptwriting business, and not always to his advantage. While ""Dunkirk"" was specially designed to work with just a few dialogues, ""Tenet"" almost exclusively relies on heavy-weight exposition chunks to explain the story. Unfortunately, Nolan hardly manages to get his ideas and concepts across to the audience. Here I also draw strong comparisons to his 2010 work ""Inception"". Nolan always has similar structures and tension arcs in his films, but for the first time I noticed that in a negative way. Although ""Tenet"" has different themes in the story, its structure is very similar to ""Inception"" (not to mention that Nolan has obviously been obsessed with the concept of time since ""Memento""). But where ""Inception"" had a very easy to follow plot despite the complex dream rules, ""Tenet"" gets lost mainly in uninteresting characters and confused attempts at explanation. Complex actions are not a point of criticism in my opinion, but you have to be able to follow them. So far, Nolan has always been very good at it, no matter how complicated the action was. With ""Tenet"" this doesn't seem to be the case anymore and I kept wondering what was happening. Especially the question of what which character actually wants was not answerable for me until halfway through the film! For me, that makes large parts of the film almost lengthy. It doesn't matter how spectacular the stunts are, I lack sympathy for the characters.The actors are not to blame because the cast is not only well chosen, but also talented. Despite his uninteresting character, John David Washington is convincing, as is Robert Pattinson. Perhaps above all of them, I liked Kenneth Branagh the most, especially the relationship with his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). For me, this was the most emotional part of the film and (above all) the best understood.Without spoiling something about the time travel elements: Nolan presents us these in a really unique way. Visually all of it looks great. Nevertheless, I strongly doubt that there are fewer time paradoxes here than in other films of this kind. Nonetheless, one notices that Nolan and his team have put a lot of meticulous work into planning the whole spectacle. The only problem is that it's hard to follow, especially in the finale ...Conclusion: From a technical point of view, ""Tenet"" is undoubtedly another milestone for Nolan, I have no doubts about that. The sound was exhausting and poorly mixed, but the visuals alone made the ideas of Nolan's film strong. If you look at the story, you will unfortunately not be convinced that directly. Maybe you have to watch the film several times, but maybe the execution is just poor. The dialogues and the script just have some flaws in my eyes. As huge as the action and the plot seem, at the end of the day ""Tenet"" sadly seems very limited in its possibilities for me ...",Tenet

Even the acting was questionable. I would have been more tolerant and consider it an experimental exercise if it were a low-budget indie. Sure there are some extravagantly staged action beats but I had absolutely no emotional investment in the story at all. At a certain point, I gave up even attempting to understand what was going on despite the interminable expositional dialog that tried to explain at length everything we had just witnessed. Wow, $300,000,000 spent here, and this is the result? The finest talents in the movie industrial complex?

958,TheFilmFreak1,Sixis out of Tenet,6,4 December 2020,"It has finally happened. Christopher Nolan has pushed me, a longtime admirer and irate apologist, over the edge. This madman cannot expect me to develop superhuman hearing just to discern his incredibly complicated, armchair temporal physics theory exposition over Ludwig Göransson's droning base. That's 80% of the film!Top marks for spectacle, medium marks for suaveness, low marks for pacing. Nolan's films usually go at a breakneck pace, but with a new editor working on this one I think Chris' worst impulses were indulged a bit too much. The film never allows itself to breathe, which for a film that revels in exposition should be impossible. The reason is that only Elizabeth Debicki's character is provided any screen time just to convey her character's state of mind, and even then that time is precious little. Another is that the film doesn't indulge in its travelogue elements; the audience is transported to about six different countries and barely gets a sense for any of them.

959,inc-133-70013,The compilation from the trashcan of Nolan's discarded ideas,2,27 August 2020,"Something's happening at Kiyv opera building (which is really in Tallinn). Terrorists or something. Who knows?Then a protagonist dude (of unknown origin and employer) is introduced to premise of time going both ways. By someone. For some reason.Most of the movie he's after plutonium, but also a piece of art, because it's connected to time travel. How? ""Need to know!""There's classic Russian oligarch villain and his trophy wife. Wife cares about her son. Villain cares about time travel. And can end the world somehow.This all makes protagonist (of unknown origin and master) team up with Robert Pattinson (a mercenary of unknown origin and master) to hop around in Tallinn, Oslo (mostly still shot in Tallinn) and Italy to chase nuclear material because it's connected to time travel. How? Psst!After some time, they end up in ""closed city"", Russia (which looks nothing like Russia or any of it's ""closed cities"") with tons of soldiers (of unknown origin and master). The soldiers proceed to fight enemy that simply doesn't exist. They also get shot at non-existent enemy and so on. At this point I was thinking I'm watching Charades or pantomime - movie seriously shows zero enemies - zero!, aside henchman of the main villain.There's some stupid time travel twists that don't work as twist, because by that time, entire lack of any comprehensible logic is a huge ball of twist. Nobody cares about a lit match in full house fire.Now, if any of it makes any sense, I'd like to get in contact with your dealer, because those drugs must be at least as good as Nolan's.Tenet was absolute garbage. Perhaps it truly takes three times of re-watching to get any of this, but movie is too poor to even sit through it once. There's nothing good in there, despite all the action and open-ended questions.Basically, think of ""Inception"", shown in reverse, and without all the star power. Hell, it'd still be better (although I hated Inception).",Tenet
960,koralrosecancion,Better than Expected,6,4 September 2020,"The premise of this movie is fascinating and left me and my husband discussing it for a good hour. Would definitely recommend time buffs to see. I would have rated it 7/10 if not for the poor acting by Washington. His unchanging facial expression and monotonous delivery made the movie drag on. Patterson's performance gave the movie some much needed energy.I honestly think a better leading man would have made the movie more interesting and understandable. There was a lot of information given to you and a lot of things only partially explained. While I think a lot of that had to do with the whole concept of time and was done on purpose, it did make the movie confusing. . . For example the difference between those that are inverted verses just jumping through time.",Tenet
961,carry-on-man,Dedication's what you need,10,17 May 2021,"Let's make no bones about it, this film is hard work and loads of people will simply give up. On first viewing I thought it was boring except for a few scenes and, had it not been a Nolan film, that would've been the end of it, BUT because it is a Nolan film I took the time and watched it twice because I knew it would be worth it as that's what I did with Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar etc (not the Batman films though, Superhero films are just garbage in my eyes, regardless of who's directing).It's a brave director that makes a film that requires multiple viewings as he knows that will alienate over half of his audience and risk many negative reviews, especially online reviews like the ones on IMBD, but he's confident enough that the viewers that understand it are worth the effort and will give good reviews to balance out all the negative ones from people that watched it once and gave up.Just watch it, be confused, give it a couple of days then watch it again. It all makes sense, especially if you turn the subtitles on for the second viewing like I did.Dedication is all you need.",Tenet
962,csj123,Great action...but doesn't make sense,6,17 May 2021,"I understood the movie the first time watching it. But it makes zero sense. If you can imagine a world where objects can travel backwards in time, then you get the gist of the movie. Problem is...there are still massive holes in the story. The action scenes are fantastic and worth watching the movie. Just accept that the story won't make a lot of sense.Kenneth Branagh is great, so is Robert Pattinson. But John David Washington seems to be bored and just reciting his lines, or just mumbles through them, through half the movie.. He also spends too much time trying to be cool, instead of just being cool. Think of how Sean Connery or Idris Elba are just cool...no matter what they do. They don't try, because they don't need to try. Washington is clearly trying to be cool...and succeeds at times, but fails miserably at others. Not saying he was miscast...saying his performance was not good. Elba would have knocked this out of the park.Overall, not a bad movie, but one that could have been much better with an even performance from Washington and fixing the plot holes.I love Nolan movies, I respect how he pushes the envelope, I admire his talent, but this wasn't his best.",Tenet
963,nscoby93,Great,10,12 September 2020,"At it's core Tenet is a classic spy/espionage/thriller but in traditional Nolan fashion he has to throw in his twists and curves but that's what makes Nolan, Nolan.I've only seen Tenet once so far and definitely have plans for multiple viewings as the inversion part of the film is rather complicated. It's made more so with how hard it is to understand/hear the dialogue. I saw this film in IMAX so the loud affects and score drowns out the actors. This made even more annoying due to how short exposition scenes are for a concept that's rather complex. I felt the explanation of what is the films feature concept ""inversion"" to be poor, but this could be due to how difficult at times it was to hear/understand making me wish for subtitles. Other than this issue I thought the film was great the characters, the actors delivered great performances especially John David Washington as ""the protagonist""The films score while I thought was great personally I felt Hans Zimmer's absence and this will most likely not even be something the general audience would recognize. Cinematography phenomenal, special affects beautiful especially in IMAX. I would highly recommend watching this film in IMAX usually I would believe how you choose to watch a film in whatever format is an opinion and personal preference. This is just not the case in my opinion for Tenet I saw it in IMAX but not true IMAX. I could see and feel I wasn't getting everything so I would say this is a must watch in 70mm IMAX. After seeing it I understand why Nolan is adamant on his film being viewed in theaters and in 70mm.Overall while I thoroughly enjoyed this film I find myself feeling somewhat disappointed and left wanting. Which is a very foreign feeling for me when it comes to Nolan as I have loved every single film of his immensely. Perhaps this is end of my honeymoon phase with Nolan but I'm hoping after multiple viewings I will understand and enjoy it more.8/10",Tenet

The rest, well who cares, really, when they're in THIS movie?The ""let's-be-cleverer-than-the-cleverest-ever"" editing is a mess.Here's an idea: let's have a plot-critical conversation take place on an insanely fast (and weird) catamaran when everyone's yelling and panting over the sound of wind and splashing water.Here's another idea: let's have the characters explain each little mission they're about to do in minute detail like it's the planning scene in Ocean's Eleven.There's no need to watch this a second time to see ""the genius"" of this film. It's not difficult to figure out during the first viewing. But that first viewing is a long, boring, tedious, annoying experience.

967,mnogogaloshi,Time and time again,7,13 September 2020,It seems that the exploration of the concept of time is one of Christopher Nolans primary obsessions. Weve already seen him play with it multiple times.In his latest movie Nola has created a complicated script and backed it with a solid 200 million dollar budget. While the visuals are indeed great at times the complexity of the story seems too self serving.A lot of people are complaining about the bad sound mixing and at times it is truly difficult to understand some of the lines. Despite that Tenet is still an enjoyable film and will certainly be enjoyed by the fans of the action and and thriller genre.

The second is something one of the guys I chat to a lot at the cinema said, did I find the sound okay because they thought it was off, which appears in a few reviews, personally I found it fine.I turned to my friend I watch a lot of films with and after 15 minutes said the biggest flaw with this film is I don't care. I found it hard to invest in the dry boring characters. The lead and his side kick were two people I didn't find engaging at all.Obviously it looked great and flowed amazingly well. But the plot wasn't clever and certainly not as clever as it thought it was. It was riddled with predictable elements, such as the scene where he ends up fighting himself.
The oligarch's reason to do what he was doing was flimsy to say the least.Was it really time travel? I thought it was a time loop? But like I said I was losing interest fast and stopped following it as I slipped in and out of it.I'll file this away with inception in 'It insists upon itself'.",Tenet

972,flopezgraziano,I think it's the worst film by Christopher Nolan,4,19 September 2020,"Nolan continues to show some ingenuity in creating stories, but the form and body of his narrative is not strong enough.Tenet is not as complex a film as it seems. What seems to add to that complexity is how poor its narrative remains, unfortunately, in terms of film language and script, lacking any feeling and whose only purpose is to convey information to the viewer. It shines in the action, without being overflowing, but it does not bring any emotion in terms of the really important moments in the story.It uses its already known temporal tricks to tell a story of spies that covers past, present and future, but despite the interesting idea, its development is clumsy and monotonous.I still feel Nolan's narrative is very artificial in both text and editing. The vast majority of his films have a very big problem of rhythm and tempo in terms of directing and editing; but the fault of this is his own text, which is only used to exchange dialogues with data, data and more data, without providing a minimum of empathy or depth to any of the characters... They all act just because he puts it in the script.The action, although ingenious, sins from these problems. They work only because of the music track that accompanies them, which is what generates the tension, but beyond that it also feels quite artificial.It is a pity that a film with such an original and interesting idea is left empty by the ways of bringing it to the text and the screen.Tenet is not a complicated film to understand, but the alleged complexity of the idea is compounded by the neutrality and hollowness of the narrative.",Tenet

It had potential, it looked really slick. The actions scenes were awesome, some of the coolest action sequences out there. I wasn't a fan of the villain, Kens Russian bag guy routine was extremely heavy handed but he was probably written that way. It was cool to see Edward, I mean R Patz in an action role and John Washington was amazing so the movie was well acted but it was just too damn hard to follow. You can't really sit back and enjoy a film when you have to work on your masters in experimental physics just to understand what's going on. Ok, is that guy going forwards? Who's going backwards? If he's been through the thingy why is he moving in that direction, not this direction? How'd they fit several dozen people through the thingy? Why aren't people noticing other people going backwards? Bad editing also got in the movies way, as did bad sound. The music and explosions were WAY too loud and the talking way too quiet. They were probably explaining something important about simultaneous backwards/forwards timey wimey stuff during the many, many chunks of dialog that I couldn't hear. The time travel machine was also way over simplified and was basically just a smallish revolving door? That somehow got several dozen army people and their equipment through it?? If they had simplified the time travel stuff a bit, it would have been a really really fun action movie. It was also a very long movie, too long to be trying to puzzle out what's going on. That being said, it's been eight months since I saw a movie in the theatre and so I was just happy to be there.

However, despite the cool backwards chronology and generally well-delivered action sequences, they are not enough to save Tenet from its poor writing or its atrocious deliveryA palindrome it may be, but it does not mean you will want to watch it twice!

978,agof,'tis an alright watch.,7,3 December 2020,"A generic time-travel movie with less layers than usual. The gimmick of the real-time traveling instead of the instant transition of other movies is used in just one short scene and a half. So that makes it less USP-scenes than already sparse Inception had. Because we get barely three ""timelines"" and a most of the traveling they did hide without interacting with the plot. Yes, just like Primer, but without all their plans going to the dogs in the last part.The simplistic story is more or less okay, but the plot is really weak and that drags down the characters too. We have an irrational cowboy Commando-like protagonist in a movie about a very tight spec-ops operation, where everything goes according to plan. The intro is slurred, the viewer never knows the amount of autoritah or clearance the protagonist has. Despite being a spec-ops guy with gorilla warfare he never even for a second questions why everyone supports his idiotic cowboy ideas which threaten the whole fate of the world just because of one stupid girl. Therefore the whole lore and setting are garbage.And this film answers my old question. Yes.

So many ""oh my godddd whaaaat"" moments from beginning to end. Especially the ending 45 minute sequence, mixed with the tense score, will have you feeling like you just took molly and you feel the back of your head all tingly from the stimulation.Robert Pattinson is amazing in this and you will love him like a close friend.

About 45 minutes into the movie I started yawning. Never a good sign. I was absolutely bored and had no idea what was going on.But the issue with this movie is that I didn't personally understand it, the issue is the story is completely nonsensical and made worse by the poorly written and meaningless dialogue. Every 5-10 minutes the lead encountered a new character who added very little substance to the movie. The plot lacked solidity and cohesion, the protagonist is so void of personality, I had no idea what his motivations were (nor the motivations of any of the characters) and I'm given very little reason to care as they were so severely lacking in relatable human emotion.Christopher Nolan did a few things right. For example, bonus points for the production value. The opening scene, for example, seemed tense and big which was heightened by Ludwig Göransson's powerful music score, yet it quickly turned into watching keystone cops who mix, mingle and do their best to confuse the heck out of you. The fight scene in the restaurant kitchen was well choreographed and kinda cool to watch, even though it was short-lived.I'm giving it a 3 because I'm sure someone will enjoy this poorly conceived yet expensive film.

His movies are intelligent, under the surface and puzzling but there is a certain limit to all of that. Like for instance Inception or better yet Memento, these are complicated movies but yet comprehensable. I think that Tenet crossed the line where the plot is too complex for people to really be entertained with the movie.
Of course I have to give credit for excellent acting, direction and visuals but this is in my opinion one of Nolan's worst, not a bad movie but not nearly his best.",Tenet

I was sad to see that Hans Zimmer was absent for this film, but Göransson did an excellent job and really was able to enhance the experience of this movie.

You have characters whispering to each other with loud background music, so its nearly impossible to hear what they are saying.The characters were boring and one dimensional, they had absolutely no background story whatsoever and a real lack of emotion was displayed.This movie basically falls flat on its face, the movie could be interesting if it made sense but it did not.",Tenet
988,dhanisingh-40445,Complicated.....worth the watch,6,9 February 2021,"The plot of Matrix was complicated so it took most of the first movie to explain how the Matrix functions. Therefore no one that watched the Matrix movies was left confused. Tenet has a complicated plot. It has characters moving in time. It has interconnected storylines and timelines. It has parallel realities and scenes with duplicate characters. Yet the movie devotes very little time explaining to its audience how its world and its technology functions. This is why in my opinion so many people are confused. It does not need multiple watches; it just needs a basic understanding of how the Inversion technology works and how characters are able to use it to move back and forth through time and manipulate the outcome. This is explained in the movie; but not very effectively; with pieces of information given as the story progresses. If you don't keep up or pay attention it will get confusing. This movie should have been 20 minutes longer so that it could set up the scenario so that the audience would not always be trying to keep up or catch up.
So, if you want to watch this movie make sure you pay attention so you don't end up confused like so many.
The VFX are amazing, the cinematography is epic and the action sequences second to none.
Like many Nolan movies, this movie is in a league of its own.
I would say definitely watch it.
It only gets a 6 from me because I thought it was unnecessarily confusing. There are people analyzing this movie all over the internet. I am sure there are a lot of plot holes. I am sure not everything in the movie makes sense. Its a fictional tale about a fictional technology. Its a complicated story that should not have been so confusing.

The acting is fine, the dialogue is pretty decent (if only it would be a little bit louder?), the action is ok but nothing groundbreaking and Robert Pattinson is nice to look at but again, there's this ""been there, done that"" feeling throughout the movie.

990,mikeferguson,7 stars for the half I understood...,7,4 May 2021,"I'm a fairly intelligent guy. For example, I know that regardless of what nutritionists say, kale is a weed, and so I avoid it. I also know that some movies require the viewer to think quite hard while watching, in order to understand what's going on, and to follow the story. ""Looper"" is one example that springs to mind; others too, like ""Predestination"", ""Ex Machina"", and ""Dark City"" fit the bill.And then there's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a film that is simultaneously so beautiful and mind-bending that upon its release in 1968, Bayer aspirin sales tripled overnight.And now, to this Pantheon of Puzzlement we can add ""Tenet"", whose director, Christopher Nolan, has a long history of making movies that you can never truly fully understand, like Inception, Momento, and Interstellar - which isn't to say they're not good or even great movies - only that they require viewers to become comfortable with the reality that in whole or in part, they are beyond comprehension.But with Tenet, Chris has raised the bar, kicked out all the stops, and created something entirely unique...a film that is at once amazing visually, maddening to listen to, and impossible to understand the key element of, which is time manipulation.It's really gorgeous to look at, but the dialogue is so often muddled that I just about wore out the button on my tv remote called ""closed captioning on replay"" - but on the bright side, it did make me feel like I was one of the characters in the movie, since I kept going back and forth in time to hear what was being said!As for the script's attempts to let us poor viewers even begin to comprehend the whole time travel element, I'm afraid the film is a pretty complete bust. Now I know it's common these days for bright fellows like Mr. Nolan to put out films that amateur reviewers like myself say are wonderful precisely because they ARE incomprehensible, and laud the fact that they are so deep and complex that it is only upon the tenth or twelfth viewing that one can hope to grasp their meaning, but I think that's frankly a load of rubbish. Sure, repeated watching of most any film will reveal things we missed the first time, but that should be because of our human habit of letting our minds wander - not because the presentation is unclear. I don't want a degree in Tenetology - I just want a story I can understand.Here's what probably happened: Nolan spent so many months/years in the writing, pre-production, filming, and editing of this film that he ""knew it"" inside and out...but in assuming that we would or could share in his level of understanding, he was wrong. But hey, it was a bold attempt, and for that, I congratulate him. Peace! Mike Ferguson/Hawaii 5-4-21.",Tenet

He speak softly, doesnt articulate and he is always muffed out by either a mask, an incredibly loud ambiant sound or even both. This movie is complex and the dialog are crucial to understand it or at least to get a glimpse behind the curtain. It doesnt give you the time to absorb information, it switch scenes like SNL on steroid : Complex dialog, action scene, complex dialog, action scene. I was craving for setups, a coherent development between scenes or characters. What is worse is that everybody in the movie seem to follow this crazy plot quite well, wich make me feel like a dumb idiot who have not the brain cells to keep up with all those smart people. It is the first time I was genuinly disapointed by Nolan. I always love when i get out of the theater and say : ''I never saw that before'', I could count on both hand the number of time wich that happen : ''the matrix, dark knight, inception, memento, interstellar, vanilla sky, fight club, avenger infinity''. Many Nolan movie in this short list. I never saw a concept like Tenet before. But it was so messy, so loud, so rushed, so complex that i felt lost and didnt enjoy the show despite a promising initial setup. I get it Mr Nolan, you are smarter than me. But i feel like he is just barging at this point.",Tenet
993,DezmoTheMovieMan,My head hurts and I lost sleep thinking about this movie,8,28 November 2020,"The movie is very interesting, and the concept has me wanting to watch it again. When I first started the movie, I was lost. Thirty minutes later, I was lost, an hour later, I was lost. Then all of a sudden, the movie starts to make sense and you wish you could rewind.The acting was incredible, I'm not used to seeing Robert Pattinson or John David Washington in a role such as this and they did an incredible job. I was equally impressed with Elizabeth Debicki, I've seen her in a few roles such as Guardians of the Galaxy and I think she's beautiful. Now I realize she is equally talented.This action thriller will take you on the ride of your life, similar to the like of Memento and Inception (both also by Nolan) or The Matrix. From the start of the movie, you're in a puzzle and your mind is playing tricks on you to the likes of ""Gheto Boys"". LOLThe movie has enough action to keep your sound system up and running, but the mind game is where its really at. While I have a lot to say about the movie, I can't provide spoilers and will leave my opinion at ""wow what a ride, can't wait to watch it again"".Bravo Nolan for creating a high quality movie that leaves you thinking.",Tenet
994,listofnames,Overly complex time wimey business,7,27 August 2020,"I mostly enjoyed this film but was also quite exhausted by the end of it. I'm not sure it would be possible for anyone to watch this film and understand it first time round, or I suspect ever. That's because it's so ridiculously complicated, probably doesn't actually make sense on multiple levels and the simultaneous moving forward while traveling backward in time thing makes utterly no sense in any conceivable way. But are they actually moving backward in time? Or is inverse entropy (or whatever its called) something completely different? Who knows. It really is rather impossible to understand. And I think that's the big big problem with this film. It's central concept is way too complex to understand.But at least Nolan still manages to make an epic action packed spectacle of it all. It does (very) roughly make enough sense that you can just about pretend to follow it that you can still enjoy it. Just about. But i found myself very frustrated (and feeling stupid) that I couldn't really grasp what was going on most of the time. It really doesn't help matters when the dialogue is frequently difficult to make out.One other big flaw that really impacted the enjoyment for me was the actual action sequences that involved the simultaneous backward and forward time interplay. They just weren't enjoyable to watch. Again because you are trying so hard to understand what is going on that you can't let yourself enjoy it. It's just all so mentally taxing! The final 'epic' battle scene at the end just exhausted the life out of me and I really wanted it to be over quickly.The three main actors are very watchable particularly Pattison and Debicki. Washington is a very cool and suave lead. The most affecting element of the plot is the relationship between Debicki and Brannagh. Love gone very very sour and dangerous. I also really enjoyed the scenes between the Indian actress and Washington. I could actually hear what they were saying too!I also enjoyed the score. It really pumped up the adrenaline to go with the action. Han Zimmerman is getting a little samey these days so this new 'epic electronic' guy really works much better.So yeah it's another great grand ambitious conceptual piece of eye candy from Nolan. But perhaps he needs to tone down the complexity for the next one. For all us average intelligence people.",Tenet

You really have to watch this movie with subtitles. If someone were to pause the movie and have them explain to them what was going on, you wouldn't be able to do it.The thing with Nolan's other movies are, yes, they can be confusing, but since they are good, you *want* to watch them a second time.

Excellent as John David Washington's raffish, British sidekick.+ Some excellent special effects. A 747 crashing into an airport warehouse.+ The usual fun, spy-thriller / action adventure toys: yachts, catamarans, helicopters, fast cars, airplanes.But, so much wrong with this film.-- Incomprehensible plot. At two places in the movie, a character says something to the effect of: ""You won't understand this"" referring to the time travel ""science."" So very true! I got lost about five minutes in. And no, I am NOT spending another two hours watching this mess. The director has one chance to tell the story and Nolan blew it (or, more cynically, filmed Tenet in such a way as to cultivate a hardcore group of repeat viewers.)-- Too much exposition which really clears up nothing. Was Michael Caine's cameo really necessary?-- Bad sound. The dialog is hard to understand. I switched to subtitles 10 minutes in and, given the complexity of the plot, had to pause every 10 minutes or so or even go back a few minutes. And I was listening on a high end, state of the art home entertainment system set to ""cinema.""-- No chemistry at all between Washington and the female lead, Elizabeth Debicki.-- Flat cinematography. With locations like Amalfi, Ravello, and London how could you possibly go wrong?So basically, a waste of time. I am certainly not returning to see a sequel or watching this again. Pity.

At times, he overshadowed the lead, the Protagonist, John David Washington, who was overly exposed, and wasn't vulnerable enough. But I got it, it was part of the puzzles to this movie.

1006,Snowgoat,Nolan's $200 million reverse car crash,6,7 September 2020,"I fully appreciate Chris Nolan's talent - specifically how he builds films around intriguing concepts using a uniquely muscular visual and audio style. But while I love so much about what he does, I find a lot of his recurring habits when it comes to pacing, editing and exposition deeply annoying - and that they detract from his obviously massive talents in other areas. Maybe I'm not on his natural wavelength of pacing, but on first viewings I usually find his films too rushed and choppy to properly connect with - though I almost always find I come to appreciate them a lot more with subsequent viewings. This was especially true of Interstellar (left me underwhelmed on first viewing, but have since come to like a lot) and to a lesser extent Inception (really disliked on fist viewing but came to appreciate). And given what I'd read about the advised ""multiple viewings"" for Tenet I went in aware this might be the first step of a long journey to appreciation - rather than a shot of instant gratification.I also went in arrogantly assuming that I'd be able to follow a plot many have claimed lost them; I've got a background in science and philosophy and have spent years writing about time travel and other possible worlds - so how hard could it be?I even went armed with a pair of earplugs to deploy should the sub bass of the score and sound effects start to overwhelm the dialogue on the already notorious soundtrack mix.And so, equipped with all this foreknowledge - as if preparing for a mission or exam - I went excitedly into my local IMAX for the first time this year.Sadly, I was still ill-prepared.The first hour or so flew by nicely. Despite the reports I'd heard about the soundtrack, I could hear pretty much everything that was being said fairly clearly, and I was managing to keep my head above water on Nolan's typical choppy editing. I quite enjoyed the pacing actually, and liked the way the sci-fi concept was kept bubbling under in the background for the first hour.But then the wheels started to fall off.I think it really began around the (beautifully shot) catamaran sailing scene, in which Kenneth Branagh's character starts relaying key plot points over a microphone and earpiece - over the sound of the sea and flapping sails. You literally cannot hear a damn word.From then on, I was playing catch-up. And sadly, things would only get worse. From this point it seems, every line of dialogue is barked through either a mask, mic, or walkie-talkie. Pretty soon the whole thing sounds like a Bane convention broadcast on shortwave radio.But just go with it, I told myself. ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it!"" Sure, you can't hear everything, but you can pick up enough to get the gist, right?Well, kind of.The problem is that pretty soon the gist itself seems to make no sense - even on its own terms. Well-worn musings on time travel get barked by characters (who weirdly seem to lurch between knowing everything and nothing about such concepts) - bearing no resemblance to the questions you actually want answering about what's unfolding on or off screen.Scenes and shots start to crash into being without warning or context, and pretty soon the whole thing starts to feel like someone got you drunk and is making you watch a foreign film without subtitles. Backwards.Though the weird thing is I never actually switched off. And I have to say the 2h45m flew by. I guess this is some testament to the technical aspects of the film (which stays looking pretty gorgeous throughout, with Ludwig Göransson's score always interesting) - as well as my faith that Nolan would somehow find a way to make it all come together and pay off in the end (though I can't say I really found any intellectual or emotional closure in the ending).I suppose I should say a bit about the performances - but the general incoherence of the film (not to mention some truly wretched dialogue) kind of overshadows all of them. The only thing I'd seen JDW in before was BlacKkKlansman, and I was a bit underwhelmed by his performance in that. Sadly he felt very similar here. He just always feels a bit passive and vacant - which is weird since his father has such a commanding cinematic presence. Branagh managed to be fairly menacing - but mumbled his way horrendously through this film - which is ironic given he used to be a standard bearer for Shakespearean theatre. Pattinson was okay, though is cut-glass accent was a little shaky; and Debicki was good - though it was a little too familiar seeing her basically redo the role she played in The Night Manager.The horrible irony is this is the film that was supposed to save cinema - when it could very well be the film that ends up being blamed for destroying it. After six months away, what kind of joe-public audience-member is going to come out of this thinking anything other than ""I should have just watched this at home with subtitles""?When I got home, I naturally looked up a bit online to try and find some explanations of the plot made by those with minds (and ears) superior to mine. Frankly I was disappointed, and it seems maybe I didn't miss all that much in the cinema after all. Either that or the online analysts simply failed to understand the same things I did. It seems the time-travel story here isn't actually that complex - it's just the incoherently telling of it that makes it seem that way.Either way, the problems with this film clearly go far beyond unintelligible dialogue. Nolan seems to have neglected the art for telling a story in a coherent fashion - and perhaps even for a coherent story. One of the key problems for me was that most of the interesting stuff about the story seemed to be happening off-camera - away from what we're actually following (or not following, as the case may be). Characters spend a lot of time talking about the (frankly nonsensical) threat from the future, and the brilliant plans devised to prevent it - but what we seem to get served is unintelligible scraps of a small part of this plan.Given how my opinions of some other Nolan films have changed, I would certainly like to see Tenet again - but heading back to the IMAX for a second viewing seems utterly pointless, since I can't imagine ever being able to decipher the dialogue I couldn't hear the first time without the aid of subtitles. Sadly, although I may well be wrong, my suspicion is that this film isn't going to get much better with subsequent viewings.I look forward to seeing what my future self makes of Tenet in ten years' time after seeing it a few more times, but for now I can't really give it anything more than a 5/10.Mainstream cinema should never be this unintelligible.",Tenet

I am starting to get a feeling that the director doesn't want people to know that he isn't smart as he would like people to believe.

This is the high-brow, much-heralded movie that was supposed to save the 2020 music theater biz?Inception worked because its ""science"" concerned the enigma of dreams and consciousness. You could allow some artistic license. It challenged you a bit. But Tenet deals with very real physics, and objects, and turns them into unknowable magic. There is no sense to make. The movie literally tells you not to bother. There is a lot of sci-fi like this, and this is no more special than any of it. It might as well be Godzilla v Kong.I can't say anything for the acting or the direction, it's such an immature-feeling throwaway movie.

I got into Tenet barely knowing what it was about. I knew it had something to do with time and I knew it was a Nolan movie. That cripple all of my lack of expectation about it. I expected a Memento, a The Prestige or, at the very least, Inception.
In the first 20 minutes, I had to check twice if it was a small studio that somehow landed Nolan (it is not). I really, really, tried to like it. But, in the end, it is something quite simple: A great concept, wasted in a generic action movie that could very well be the next Fast and Furious.
The amount of exposition forced during the movie is absurd and the character development is as thin as it gets. The motives never really make sense and even the action gets boring. I had to google who the protagonist was fighting against in the biggest action piece of the movie, because they simply shoot at the air and run forward.
The worst part of it is that a movie this bad has a concept this good. Most of the scenes about time inversion are great and some really clever things happen because of it. But all of the rest makes it so you can't enjoy it, instead looking like you're watching two different movies at the same time.

1013,demented_peruvian,The mystery solved: it's simply very derivative.,6,1 January 2021,"""Tenet"" = ""Mission Impossible"" + ""The Night Manager"" + 007 (e.g. ""Thunderball"") + ""Primer"" + ""Dr Strange"" + ""Call of Duty"" + ""Bill & Ted"".That's all there is to the mystery. I am a Nolan fan, but not a devout fanboy. I don't mind derivative movies as long as the copycat nature doesn't distract me, and there's something new added. Nolan's usually original or provides a new spin on well-worm territory. Nolan-wise, this comes closest to ""Interstellar"": many copied elements, with high-level physics added, and dialogue often obscured by the soundtrack and mixing. However, at least that had some intriguing visuals and innovative scenarios. ""Tenet"" offers nome of that. Additionally, it lacks the heart at the center of Nolan's movies that take the tales to another level: he makes us care for the characters and their internal struggles. ""Tenet"" doesn't bother with that; it's all plot/action.The first 90 minutes are a Cruise-era M:I movie, with Nolan trying to pull off action scenes akin to ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"", but not as interesting. A villain and his wife are lifted straight out of ""The Night Manager"", and our hero approaches the situation like a classic James Bond. Occasionally things reverse, as in the trailer, but rarely in an impressive way.Then the movie switches to more typical cerebral Nolan time-twiting territory. Characters are allowed to grow a bit. They carry out concepts from ""Primer"" but in a more entertaining way. It becomes more interesting, but loses itself with unconvincing explanations for the motivations of the villains. They lift entire dialogue from ""Timecop"" and the latest MCU movies.The final act centers around a raid that is supposed to impress us with time mixes, remiscent of the final act of ""Dr Strange"", but just feels like watching someone play ""Call of Duty"" or a similar game. And the characters engage in time-travelling one-upmanship straight out of ""Bill & Ted"" movies, but serious.I am flabbergasted why Mr Nolan insisted on this being seen in theaters in the widest screen possible. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematographic talents are underused.Here's hopong a return to better Nolan.",Tenet

1023,NonSequiturL,"Put on your brain-bending pants, cause it's time for Tenet!",8,15 September 2020,"Put on your brain-bending pants, cause it's time for Tenet! Christopher Nolan's long-awaited time traveling blockbuster is in cinemas despite COVID-19 ravaging the movie-going public.With everything that's gone on in 2020, the act of going to the movies feels anachronistic. It's like inverting time and going back to when it was okay to inhale popcorn aromas and other people's air without fear of suffering a horrible death. Is Tenet worth the health risk?Well, no. If you live in a place where COVID-19 is looming large, DO NOT GO TO THE CINEMA and risk yourself, or others! But in a safe environment (preferably at home, or a drive-in) Tenet is good, and I'm not just saying that because as a cinema fan it feels like I'm starving in the desert and someone threw me a cracker. It's actually genuinely good.Like the majority of Nolan's filmography, it's grand in both scale of production and ideas. He's always played with notions of temporality in film, but not quite this much since 2000's Memento. That film operated on the novel concept of telling its story in reverse, and the only clear way to one up that is to run a story both backwards and forwards at the same time, right? Enter Tenet.John David Washington plays a secret agent known only as ""The Protagonist"". He's sent on a mission to find the source of mysterious weaponry that's seemingly travelling backwards in time from a war destined to happen in the future. With the help of fellow agent Neil (Robert Pattinson), he ends up on the trail of a notorious arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) and his wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Sator is up to all sorts of temporal-no-good, and the race to save both the future and the past is on.As usual, Nolan dazzles with a Bond-esque world tour of locations, an array of ambitious practical effects, and prodigiously filmed chase scenes. The incredible visuals are underscored by a head-splitting soundtrack that's so loud it might actually reverse time on its own. The action is dizzying, like being hit with a flashbang, but then again, maybe I've just spent too much time in lockdown and I'm no longer able to handle the stimulus? Either way, it's impressive stuff.Where Tenet shines most is in its concepts. Ideas are packed so tight it feels like the movie is going to explode and collapse under the sheer weight of time travel theory and philosophy. A vast majority of Nolan's screenplay appears to have been written on grid and graph paper, with more interest in mathematical technicality of scenes rather than characters. But, if you're a veteran of the man's movies, you'll already know to expect this going in. His weak point has always been the clinical nature of his human drama.Nolan's characters are always so busy shooting thick expository dialogue and plot all over each other that there's no chance to develop real chemistry. The dramatically crucial relationships between Branagh and Debicki, and Debicki and Washington, both fail to crackle. There may be a tiny spark of real chemistry between Washington and Pattinson, but they're always so pressed into action and plot that whatever was there gets buried, and when it should be paying off toward the end, the audience feels nothing.Washington's character has the charisma of a two-by-four, but that's most likely the direction he was given rather than the actor's fault. Pattinson doesn't fare much better. In some instances, the movie actively works against you connecting with its characters. During one of the lengthy, pivotal action scenes, our heroes are lost amongst a platoon of soldiers wearing masks. It makes you feel like you're watching someone play Call of Duty.Yes, Tenet suffers from many of the same problems as Nolan's other work. The issues are perhaps amplified here by the absence of Hans (currently tied up with Dune) Zimmer's emotionally charged bombast that gave their previous collaborations a boost in the heart department. Ludwig Göransson is a decent replacement for Zimmer, and fills the air with some intriguing reversed music and sounds, but still doesn't quite hit the same heights as Zimmer.Sure, this is a ""thinking person's"" action film, but, don't think about it for too long. Tenet invites second, or third viewings to understand all of its time traveling nuance. Maybe I'll figure it out eventually, but after a single viewing? I'm convinced the story doesn't make a lick of sense. For example, when a hole is punched in a wall by a bullet from the future, at what point in the past does that hole first appear? Cause and effect doesn't work that way, Christopher! I don't care if you had renowned theoretical physicist Kip Thorne in the credits! It doesn't make sense!But despite all the whining and complaining I've done here, I had huge amounts of fun with Tenet. I was engaged for the entire two and a half hours. The film throws so much at you, there's no chance to get bored, and it gives us things we've never quite seen in a movie before.With the state of cinema at the hands of coronavirus, Tenet feels bittersweet, like some kind of finale for blockbuster cinema. Or maybe more like a funeral dirge. In 2013, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg prophesied the death of the blockbuster, albeit under different circumstances. COVID seems to have made that prediction come true, at least for the foreseeable future.Unfortunately, Tenet is an experience that deserves to be fulfilled on a big screen, and in glorious 70mm, but therein lies the problem with Warner releasing it right now. While so many parts of the world are overrun by COVID infection, it's impossible and irresponsible to recommend people go out and see it today, especially in virus hotspots. By all means, go and see it at a drive-in, but in a traditional cinema? Don't risk it. Wait until you can pop some corn and relax on the couch at home.",Tenet

Also, the film could have been reduced to 2 hours as it is heavily reliant on dialogue and can get tedious at times. Otherwise, great film to watch during COVID times.

We don't need CG, all we need to do is run our scenes backward"".This was a very cheap and very ineffective technique to film an action movie. Shame on you Christopher Nolan. Inception this is NOT.If that weren't bad enough, the plot is about as clear as a Mississippi swamp.Those fans that are saying ""watch it 2-3 times then you'll get it"" need professional help.

There is no problem to confuse movie watchers. Alfred Hitchcock was the first and the best in that field. His style was to clarify all the mysteries at the end of the movie. Nolan has the same attitude. Memento is the proper sample of his movies but not in Tenet, he sacrificed excitement for confusion .
Tenet had a very interesting idea which was wasted. Nolan used all of his capabilities to confuse and wonder watchers. Even, there are no characters in the movie. all of them are paper characters , the dialogues are so boring. Action scenes are no not exciting.
The mainstream of the story was explained in few sporadic dialogues. So I was never excited in any scenes, especially in action scenes because of confusion. I myself found out the story after five times of watching, and when I was watching it for the sixth time, there was no excitement for me. Tenet has no important message to say except for an interesting story which was grinded .",Tenet

1036,BoshArrow,A better spy thriller than most Bond movies,8,4 November 2021,"Confusing and complex plot, lots of exposition, people nervously trying to find any reason for what is going on: yes, the movie has many issues and it is far behind other Nolan's masterpieces such as The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, Memento or The Prestige but it is still an engaging spy thriller.Christopher Nolan manages to greatly recreate the intense spy atmosphere from the best Bond and Bourne movies and delivers really entertaining action sequences. Washington and Pattinson form a successful partnership which is the key element throughout the entire plot, while Branagh stars as the formidable and influential Sator. His character is certainly better developed than Rami Malek's Safin in No Time to Die.Tenet is a visually stunning movie since most of the locations are quite well picked with scenes in India, Vietnam, Estonia, Great Britain and Ukraine. In addition, the visual effects are significant and essential aspect of the film and their execution is outstanding.To sum up, you will probably need to watch Tenet more than once in order to fully appreciate it. It definitely has more positive than negative sides which makes it a good movie! Don't rush into conclusions and be patient while watching it!",Tenet

The score VERY loud while dialogues were on a quiet side).The movie was slow, in spite of very fast action sequences (seems like a paradox but it's true). You know when movie is bad when you start nervously looking at your watch counting minutes to the end of the movie. 150 minutes - WAY too long.To be frank, I am not sure how this movie could be fixed as it was very hard to follow.

I watch all movies with subtitles when available so that's probably why I understood the first go round and during the final wrap up of the characters I thought it was brilliant. Not only for the story but watching the scenes from a different perspective was like a ""I see it!"" moment. It's complicated and some people just won't get it.This movie is made for fans of Interstellar (2014), Arrival (2016), Signs (2002) and the like.I deducted stars simply for the problem with dialogue clarity.",Tenet
1039,lucaslw-93145,Currently a high 8/10 with subtitles; A good audio mixing and mastering session away from being a low to solid 9/10,8,26 December 2020,"Everyone's got the same criticism for Nolan. Your audio needs work. It was an issue with Saito in Inception, Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, everyone in Dunkirk and now, in a movie so heavily plot driven, with complex world-building reliant purely on actor dialogue, Nolan hits us with a poorly mixed audio track. It's baffling, because the whole issue would be solved very succinctly with better voice work from the actors, better mixing from the audio team, or (very simply) the addition of subtitles in Helvetica Neue along the bottom of the screen. Nolan has a penchant for casting foreign actors in roles they absolutely nail, unlike a handful of other directors who do so solely to pander or fulfill a socially progressive quota, but holy cow Nolan. Go the extra mile and give them subtitles if your audio team can't get their act together.Ok audio aside, the cast was put together phenomenally, everyone killed their end of things with performances from Robert Pattinson and Himesh Patel deserving a bit of extra commendation. There were moments of expositional dialogue in the beginning where John David Washington's delivery felt a little stiff, but I'd chalk that up to oversight on direction or a misstep in the post-production editing. Special note should be made for Washington's fluidity with a firearm. The firearm usage in this film was quite immersive and felt really well executed. The training that the actors went through was clearly reflected in the firefight choreography of this film.Ok the plot. Without saying too much, it's very captivating. Once you flip on subtitles and can understand what's happening and all the explanations, the film takes on an interesting edge. The complexity characteristic of a Nolan time-themed film plays out as you could expect, but does fall short of Inception or The Prestige by a few inches. As the plot gets more complex, so too do the questions, particularly in the last 10 minutes of the film where the resolution of the film leaves a few loose ends that we'll no doubt have questions about for years to come. It's not as clean from plot-holes as Inception or Interstellar was, but for the most part, Tenet does a fairly good job of answer questions the audience has for the first 90% of the film.Oh also, Ludwig Goransson killed the soundtrack for this film. Despite Nolan's best attempts to sabotage the audio of his movie, his composer sweeps in to save your ears with a powerful Zimmer-esque symphonic masterpiece that not only fills the large shoes Zimmer left for him, but may even (in my opinion) exceed the best of Zimmer's work on Nolan's films. I don't know, Goransson is obviously a newcoming force to be reckoned with, but I think he may be only a few films away from being the greatest movie composer of our generation.",Tenet

The plot , frankly, doesn't make sense. Or maybe it does if you view it enough times. Or are inebriated. But it isn't possible to understand exactly what is happening and why. If you think you understand the plot of the film, you don't.That said if you like action films, watch this movie. You will find it awesome as well as confusing.

1046,frezeframe,Worth it- but intensely cerebral for 2.5 hours with no break in tension,8,14 September 2020,"I respect the cinematic art that is Tenet. It's just something you experience- and if you try to follow the plot it will be confusing. But in this case, that confusion is intentional and one thing is obvious, this film is an intentional well planned out vision of Christopher Nolan. That confidence and certainty of a director is what you respect. Many great filmmakers make strange mind bending films. I think the action in Tenet was entertaining and the concept was interesting. But I feel it came up short given the storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan.I think a top tier director like Nolan has a responsibility to level the tension. A film that's super intense for 2 1/2 hours straight is stressful. The audience has to do a lot of work to try to figure out what's going on and it's exhausting. You need to pull back and let some of it simmer. I think Nolan has entered the echo chamber stage of his career. No one's going to tell him no, or that somethings not right.**this paragraph doesn't have spoilers per say, as no one knows what this film is really about- but it you haven't seen the film, spoiler alert. I feel the Indian lady (aka oracle master weapons dealer) was flat and her entire subplot could have been cut out. And I wished the opening opera scene tied into the plot more- and I think there was too much plot being revealed through dialogue. The actors were having to explain the plot- and it still didn't make sense even to them! HahaI did enjoy it. Judging on a Nolan curve, I would give it a B+. I think it's probably his fourth best film. They will probably shower it with Oscars, but 10 years from now I don't think anybody's going to be quoting Tenant or talking about it, because it's unclear what it was about- without having it explained to you in a director's commentary. And Inception and Interstellar both played with time better than Tenet.Even though it was clearly visionary, a unique piece of art that plays with the rules of the medium and the backwards action stuff was innovative... in the end, the bad guy wasn't charismatic enough and the good guys were too busy explaining the world to each other, and the ending wasn't amazing.

1048,onze-kris,Don't enter,1,15 April 2021,"So first of all. Where is my love for the director?I loved the bad knight trilogy allthough I wouldn't call myself a superhero movie fan. And I thought Memento certainly had its moments... it dragged on for me and would have been great as 25 minute short.Now I don't think Nolan is the best storywriter by far. He takes something and seems to get lost himself before he finishes the loose ends quickly. Job done.And there is some particularly badly written dialogue in the movie... It's forced at times.I won't spend much time in writing this ""review"". But I think of a filmmaker as someone who tries to tell a story. To me the story doesn't have to be explained. It doesn't have to be logical sound even. Like looking at art or listening to a song... How does it make me feel. What do I take away from it.I am sad to say he fails miserable in telling the story here. And i end up walking away with nothing.I get the story I can explain it very short...the earth is doomed by our own doing People from the future have left a device that consists of 9 parts in our timeline. They use Kenneth brannagh to reassamble that device.If Kenneth brannagh dies before the ""protagonist"" secures the last part the world ends...Most videogames nowadays have better storylines.There is more to it. And it sort of makes sense (most of the time) And if not you can explain by bending time that if it doesn't succeed at first you would be able to try again. In the movie they sort of make it possible in one go by an inverted team and a real time team. This allows you to anticipate what is happening by what is learned from the inverted team.What doesn't make sense is that the protagonist has his priorities wrong at times.And thus the story dwells on for a long time without much happening. Only to conclude very quickly near the end.I don't think the last ten minute action is shot (or edited that it seems 10 minutes) in real time for example and to me that would show Nolan's love for filmmaking more than using different aspect ratio's through the movie.You heard that right different aspect ratios..
and to me there wasn't a reason as to why different aspect ratios where used to improve the story telling.I think Nolan as a filmmaker shines as he gets material and has some sort of freedom with it .Frankly I found this a bigger mess than inception. I am in the minority of not liking Inception here. So don't take my word for granted. But if you didn't like Inception certainly stay away from this one..",Tenet

The problem I had with it, was they had this really cool idea about time, and how people can move forward or backward through it for some nefarious purpose, then they muddied it up with a story they never explained, and kept going without ever connecting the dots. The grand moral at the end was ""a mother's love is stronger than anything, and she'll do whatever she has to to be with her son."" Like was that why this movie exists?!?!? This is a masterpiece?!? Grow up.I started getting pissed when the characters had to construct this elaborate plan to break into that high-security vault to steal the drawing. The heist was actually interesting and there was action present. Afterall that drawing (for no legitimate or logical reason) was forcing the girl to be a slave to her abusive husband. So protagonist and Neil construct this plan and go into the vault, dodging the suffocation gas that puts out fires, ultimately finding future protagonist and scuffle. And that's it.However long later, girl is on cloud nine cause protagonist stole the drawing. But he didn't really; he lied, for some reason?!? Girl finds out that he lied because abusive husband serves her the drawing on a silver breakfast platter. So here we are, an elaborate heist, a failed mission, a lie saying they succeeded, but no clear reason as to why any of that mattered or why protagonist would lie to her. And back to the drawing... how can a shiiiitteee piece of paper of two people hugging (or something) force girl to be a slave?!!!!?Again. This is no masterpiece. You're not interesting, enlightened, or an intellectual for using that word. You appear the opposite because ""having to use my brain"" does not make it a good movie. If anything, your brain swindled you by creating a fantasy or an explanation of this film that is incorrect. It was entirely incoherent, and while it had a cool premise, it failed completely. I might watch it again so I can at least remember character names when I go to talk badly about it. After 2.5 hours of watching four characters spin in circles around each other, the only memorable name was Neil. Goes to show how poorly these characters were written and developed.

1054,mohammadhoseinjj-867-566623,Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus,10,4 September 2020,"Tenet is Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. On the technical side, few films in history have anything like the action of this film. Every Scene is Magic, and you will think, ""How making this is even possible?"". And that ""No Green Screen"" rule is paying off. Because of that, you can believe the most unbelievable things are happening on the screen. Tenet never looks like animation or something full of CGI effects. And when you watch it, You will probably accept that fact is so important.
Suppose someone mutes this film and watches it. It's perfection. If someone shot the picture off and only listen to the sound of this film, It's Perfection. So When they get combined, Tenet has become an experience like no other.
Ludwig Göransson's Awesome Score has been synced with every scene and is adding to all of them. I love Hans Zimmer, but right now, I don't think even that great man was capable of doing this. The reason is this music feels different from anything I've ever heard in any Christopher Nolan Film.
I've watched Tenet twice (So far); the First time, I loved it, and the second time, I loved it. The script does a great job of presenting everything to you in the best possible way. And at the same time, Tenet has fewer exhibition scenes than Interstellar or Inception. So every time you watch it, you will be focused on more things. But It's understandable and self-explaining. The reason that a lot of people will more like The Story for the second time is the fact that THE FILM IS UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL. It has some shots, which made me speechless and gave me pure joy. As much as I couldn't focus my mind on the story and wanted to be just thinking about the Perfect Picture, I'm watching.
This film will stand the test of time. I don't want to spoil anything, So I can't talk about how much I love some of the characters and how the actors have got chosen with no miss fire.

1062,jamieaster,An incredible roller coaster time travel inversion ride from beginning to end,9,26 August 2020,This film started off slow and about half way through it really picks up the very first scene where you see the protagonist trying to safe those people was such an awesome action sequence it is one of many amazing action sequences throughout the film what the director presents us with is to question reality and the concept of time which makes you rethink both of those possibilities with all of this in mind the cinematography and the characters within the story and everyone involved in the making of this film drives the story forward as there are many twists and turns and as you get through the story slowly everything in front of you starts to make sense and everything slowly gets explained to us the viewers I would highly recommend checking this film out,Tenet
1063,jahn-00325,Another espionage action movie with some incomprehensible sci-fi,6,4 January 2021,"Tenet is a controversial meal: it appears delicious but cooked as indigestible. The main premise of the movie is time travelling, and, apparently, it's a very fertile topic capable of giving birth to many curious combinations of ideas. However, the subject should be handled with caution because it's very fragile: one wrong step and the whole work is at risk of crashing under a heavy construction of paradoxes and flaws.Nolan seems to have predicted it all and that's why spent more than 5 years working on a scenario for the movie. Unfortunately, during the process he might have forgotten that we're supposed to absorb the ultimate outcome of years of his thoughts in a little more than 2 hours. As a result, we watch a whole lot of actions taking place on our screens immediately following one after another without pauses or proper explanation. The heroes are rushing through the plot almost unemotionally: except for the main female character the others' emotions look akin to those of Buddhist monks. To cap it all, the sci-fi aspect is easily lost among all this swift constant flow of time peculiarities, and in the end we're left with merely one more story about James Bond attempting to save the world again.To sum it up, Nolan appears to have got so engrossed by his own ingenious puzzle that he produced the work not for spectators but rather for himself. If you exclude this incomprehensible mystery, there is nothing more than just one more action movie about spies with some elaborate graphical effects.",Tenet
1064,MorpheusOne,Some potential; too convoluted.,5,1 August 2021,"I enjoyed the premise for this movie; overall, I think that the plot for this movie is quite good. However, it just isn't explained well enough to justify the script or the movie as a whole. How objects move through time, in particularly how they move backwards, has everything to do the radiation, or whatever it is, that makes them 'inverted'. Yea, it comes from the future; but, it is used & controlled by the good guys, in the present, to fight the bad guys - so, how do they do that!? The story does not explain this and it doesn't even try.Ultimately, the story is to convoluted to really appreciate this movie; although, it's not a complete & total disaster - I do appreciate the multi-racial/ethnic cast. And the movie was acted rather well. While the story/script was pretty bad, honestly, the choreography and the directing are the two worst things about this movie. Christopher Nolan is skidding downhill. Fast. After his complete FAILURE with Interstellar...I am amazed that this movie even got made. His family should put him in a home. Today.",Tenet

So Tenet is not a spystory, or sci-fi: it's a travesty.Tenet is what happens when an artist becomes so big that nobody can tell him anymore when he is going off track. I enjoyed very much all the other Nolan works, but this one looks just like a collection of his worst defects.Since time travel is not available in our reality, I suggest to hold on against the hype for a couple of weeks and to not waste your time in watching this movie: you will have spared a couple of precious hours of your only life.",Tenet

1071,Steve_Holt_,If you didnt get it maybe it's you thats dumb and not the movie,9,2 September 2020,"Its hard to say much without giving away key plot points (dont worry, no spoilers), but Tenet is a great movie that is perhaps too smart for the average moviegoer. The story deals with personal struggles, friendships, beginnings and endings, all set against the hypotheticals of time play. It's kind of like a crazy, beautiful dance that you wish you could do with someone you love. It's a real good movie.To be fair, it probably needs to be watched at least twice. But as is said: real art requires you to look at it again. This isnt the time-travel story of Avengers Endgame, though it may be a commentary on the state of movie going today when a movie like that breaks the box office and and a movie like Tenet is complained about for being to complex and having no heart. And perhaps that can be your gauge; if you thought Endgame was amazing, then maybe stay away from this one. But if Endgame drove you nuts with all the silliness, then perhaps this one is up your alley. It definitely demands your attention, and even so, it's almost impossible to get everything. In the end, though, it's worth it.One note, however; the sound is so loud it was difficult to discern what were explosions, what were gunshots, and what was musical score. I highly suggest a person be prepared to ask their theater to turn down the volume, or wear some ear covers to dampen the sound and make it more discernible. I held my hands over my ears a few times and it really helped when I did.This is not a ""check your brain at the door"" movie.

John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were exquisite and Elizabeth Debicki added much interest to the story.However, it left me wanting more information and explanation.

Due to the complexity of the narrative, there was little scope for acting, and the characters were talking all the time to explain the situation. The dialogues might actually sound normal if the movie is slowed down to 0.8x. It has ten hours worth of story-telling crammed into 2.5 hours.

1077,heinigrunbaum-786-20424,Worst Action Scenes Ever in the History of Cinema !!!,2,31 August 2020,"Now, if you check out my other reviews and ratings of Christopher Nola's movies, you will understand that I absolutely love his films and great cinematic talent.But I have to be honest with myself and I am not afraid of the future for Mr. Nolan and his future films. Even Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola have made a few not so good movies.The Tenet is a very, very bad movie. In all aspects. The story is really bad. In fact so bad that I don't understand it. I don't get it what so ever. And Nolan's visual style in this movie feels like he didn't even try. It seems like he was bored with himself and this film, but that said, being a filmmaker myself, he might just have been blinded by issues with the whole production and these things happens, even to the best Film directors.Why do we need a scene with Michael Caine that lasts no more than a minute and a half? Why? Doesn't make sense, not even for the story, the script. It's like Nolan thought to himself that Michale is old and he might die any day now and he wanted his last movie to be his movie.But what really brings this movie down to the most horrible film I have seen in many, many years, besides the story that I don't understand (sorry, I don't understand the Tenet's story) ---- SHALL I REPEAT MYSELF???? What really brings it down are the horrible actions scenes THAT ARE BACKWARDS, because something from the future travels back in time and moves BACKWARDS because it is from the future?????THIS MOVIE IS BAD - BAD - BAD - BADSorry, Nolan, I don't get it and I was almost falling asleep during some of the action scenes. I had to fight hard to keep myself awake and this has never happened to me since watching the stupid long ending scene of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) which I rated with one (1) Star.In fact, I believe the only reason why I rated THE TENET two (2) stars is because I have a deep respect for Mr. Nolan and his work - but NOT this time because I don't get it.

1083,Mikheil-H,Nolan's masterpiece..... on the second watch..... maybe?,7,14 November 2020,"Armed with the word Tenet and an overbearing threat of the end of the world, we follow John David Washington (Blackkklansman) as he discovers the power of time inversion and all the visually spectacular prospects that concept can bring. However, the real draw for film fans is the question of what happens when Christopher Nolan takes Memento, Inception and James Bond and merges it with top-of-their-game actors, a Hans Zimmer impersonator and full monetary backing from Warner Bros. The answer is Tenet, the newest time-based sci-fi action film from Christopher Nolan.Tenet, to put it mildly, is a lot to wrap a first-time viewer's head around. It acts, in a bizarre way, like an educational course. The first act is the lesson, exemplified by characters throwing heaps upon heaps of exposition at the audience in an attempt to get them ready for the coursework of the second act and the exam of the third act. As such (like with exams) it helps to know the answers beforehand which is why that (perhaps by design) Tenet is improved greatly upon a second watch. Trust me, the opening concert scene makes more sense with a second viewing.If there is one thing Christopher Nolan is a master of, it is spectacle and Tenet has this in spades. With its' central concept of inversion and time reversal, Tenet can put visual twists on common concepts to make them feel new, exciting and viscerally thrilling. Whether this is a fist fight, a car chase or a full-scale armed assault, Tenet is able to use its' time reversal technique to keep the film visually impressive, regardless of whether audiences understand what's going on or not. Thankfully, along with impressive (and mostly practical) visuals, John David Washington inhabits a charismatic protagonist that rarely fails to lose the audience's investment in the plot. Furthermore, Robert Pattinson successfully crushes any doubts surrounding his upcoming role as The Batman/ Bruce Wayne with his supremely sophisticated yet deadly 'Neil'.However, Tenet is far from the best Nolan has created. It lacks the emotional attachment that inhabited Interstellar, the perfect pacing of The Dark Knight or the innovative storytelling of Memento. Furthermore, any praise that could be given to its' dialogue is not possible as multiple scenes have background music and sound effects which drown out voices via some horrendous sound mixing (did anyone hear the boat race scene in its' entirety?). This does all unite to make a film that, whilst techinically, visually and narratively (insofar that it's not completely incomprehensible) impressive, is ultimately very hollow in executionOverall, even with the aforementioned limitations, due to the film's ability to consistently provide additional information upon re-watch, I would not be surprised if Tenet slowly crept up the ranks to become a classic amongst Nolan's collection (or at the very least a cult classic). Still, regardless of my thoughts on the film, I was just happy to be back in a cinema again tbh.",Tenet

1087,hugues-talbot,"Good SF thriller, unusual storyline, bit gimmicky",8,6 September 2021,"This film features a storyline that goes a step further with Nolan's obsession: time. In this storyline, a device makes it possible for objects and persons to go both forward and backward in time. Only the arrow of time is changed, not the rate. This makes it a ""time travel' SF movie but with interesting constraints that may not be entirely inconsistent with known physics.It's very clever and makes for a film which was for me very enjoyable, if you like Nolan's style. I loved the way he introduced elements that complexify the story little by little, and still manages to surprise, to include humanist philosophical elements, and more. In this way it was similar to Inception.Nonetheless, there are some unavoidable inconsistencies and ad-hoc explanations. The plot is complex and I think at least two viewings are necessary to understand and enjoy the whole plot, which may explain the relatively poor ratings compared to Nolan's other recent films like Interstellar.In terms of real physics, a particle traveling backward in time is interpreted as an anti-particle. And so ""logically"" a whole person travelling backward in time would be made of anti-matter which would cause all sorts of problems, like being unable to interact with normal matter without causing particle annihilations, associated huge bursts of radiation, etc. This is hugely simplified in the movie into one forward person not being allowed to touch their reversed version (anti-person ?) but otherwise there is no plot, so this is forgivable.Nolan continues to come up with unlikely but wholly enjoyable, clever scenarios, excellent cast and actor direction as well as a sure-footed direction that does not overly rely on special effects.Recommended.",Tenet

1091,gigitville,Not as Good as it Could Be,7,17 September 2020,"Tenet had a lot of the ""new Christopher Nolan movie"" hype, and the people who enjoy his movies were quite excited. There has always been, and always will be, that group of people of see Christopher Nolan movies as pretentious and bland, and while I've always enjoyed his movies, Tenet really felt worthy of that critique.
The most widespread problem with the whole movie was that it felt like Nolan was leaning on the concept of ""If I make the dialogue, exposition, and concept sound super complex and smart, no one will realize they don't know what's going on."" An argument can be made that all of his films fall under this problem, but in movies like Inception and even Interstellar, the complicated plot and subject matter could still be deciphered by the audience. And, there was enough to readily latch onto to make the audience want to piece things together. Tenet was confusing and very fast paced from the get go, and never really gave the audience any time to breathe. Not to mention that 70% of the dialogue was exposition dumps, and due to the sound mixing drowning out the dialogue more often than not, the convoluted explanations of what was happening never actually made things easier to follow. And you can have a complicated plot and premise worthy of the most elite and pretentious audience without making things confusing. In fact, complicated shouldn't mean confusing.The plot and pacing also didn't assist in the audience's ability to follow and be invested in what was happening. At least for me, it was pretty sporadic that I really cared about what was happening on screen, mostly due to that I often wasn't sure what the characters were working toward or trying to prevent. And I'd like to think I can follow movies pretty well, and if this were just a case of the plot and filmmaking being ""too complex"" and going over my head, that'd be fine. But it really seemed that the writing was problematic. Because things were not clear enough, soon enough. The rules of inverting were explained in a very dense exposition dump at the beginning, and around 2/3's into the movie after a shift in the plot, and for a premise as interesting as this one, the audience should know the rules concretely early on. And this isn't synonymous to the audience being babysat through the whole plot and needing their handheld through the whole film. Back to Inception, which is a reasonable comparison since it's another complicated thriller by the same director and writer, the rules of inception and dreaming were explained effectively and well early on. This could've been the same in Tenet, but we only had rushed exposition dumps. Not to mention, we have an action scene right off the bat and subsequent secret agency drama that is never really explained. Starting the audience with something chaotic and plunging them into the action isn't inherently a bad thing, but this was a confusing start. And The Protagonist being a part of the Tenet organization is just sort of thrown in there after he proves his loyalty to them? To his old team? Did he have an old organization or was it the same as the Tenet group? Anyway, he learns about the time inverting and then just...starts doing things to, prevent the impending war? Honestly, one of the other biggest problems is that the goals of the characters and of the story in general, aren't that clear until the end of the second act.So the character and plot goals, the way the Tenet organization and rules of inverting works, and what our characters were actually working toward with the drawing/Andrei shenanigans, all needed to be clearer sooner. It was difficult to latch onto the plot, and therefore, become invested in the story. You don't necessarily need to be limited by a three of five part story arc, but there really didn't feel like any story arc, whatsoever. It felt like meandering and random plot points that were working toward something that wasn't clear, until the lights were turned on and we learned what the characters were trying to prevent, and what they needed to do to do so.Now there are still pros along with these cons. They didn't outweigh them, but they were there. The performances, especially John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh, were amazing. JDW has this unique, reserved charisma that made watching him on screen very captivating. His chemistry with Robert Pattinson, who also had a great performance as Neil, made their scenes together the best of the movie. Elizabeth Debicki is criminally underrated as an actor in general, and she gave a great performance. It was a bit of a bummer that she was the only consistent female character in the movie and was also a victim of an abusive marriage, but she got a fulfilling arc where she defeated her husband when she couldn't in the past so, that's good at least. I guess. I wonder if Christopher Nolan will ever write more than 3 female characters in one movie, one of which not being a dead or victimized wife figure.Anyway, there were also some really interesting action scenes. There were two early on that were pretty traditional but done very well and not gratuitous. And the premise of inverting time is a very interesting one, that fostered a handful of very interesting half backward action scenes. In all honesty {spoiler} the action scene where Neil and The Protagonist go back to the Oslo airport and end up being the two they were fighting against in the past, was really interesting and satisfying to watch.Overall, the whole viewing experience was okay. There were enjoyable things, yes, but the movie was overwhelmingly just exposition dumps that didn't really explain things enough, some cool action scenes and music, decent cinematography, and great acting performances. It's not terribly memorable, and you certainly felt the long runtime a few times when the pacing lagged. Christopher Nolan is a name that comes with high expectations, and unfortunately, this didn't live up as much as it could've. 7/10.",Tenet

The movie is just spectacular in every way imaginable and is 100% worth the long wait. The movie centers around the Protagonist as he makes his way through international espionage armed with only the word Tenet. The action in this movie is some of the best ever shot and I would argue is even better than Inception's. The use of time in this movie is in depth and logical, while also being extremely enjoyable to watch. The performances in this movie are all top notch with John David Washington being simply outstanding. I will admit that the movie does fall into a lot of common Christopher Nolanism, but this is not a bad thing. The cinematography in this movie is just beautiful and expansive. The score is also extremely powerful with it being used extremely well throughout the movie. The movie makes me want to watch more Nolan movies, but maybe after a day or two. The movie is also thrilling throughout its whole 2.5 hour run time. I was on the front of my seat the whole time and when the movie makes reveals about what was happening almost always blew me away. The reveals were all cinematically and pleasing story wise because Nolan gives the viewer just enough to know what is going to happen while also making it difficult to predict. The movie is one of the best this year and a movie I think everyone needs to see immediately.

You have to watch it with subtitles though, the sound editing is not that good. You can understand it if you want carefully, not doing other things. Yes, sometimes voices are not that audible, but that does not make the movie bad. And I want to say other reviewers that if you can't understand or if you don't like it, it doesn't mean its bad. For example, I did not like Fight Club, but it is still one of the best films. So, be adequate.The cinematography, score, visuals, performances are incredible and stunning.

Dialogue very complicated and many of the violent scenes gratuitous and made no sense.

1107,anthony_ian,"Mind-Blowing But Yeah, It'll Take More Than One Viewing",8,2 September 2020,"Just saw it at IMAX. If YOU CAN SEE AT ON IMAX, DO IT.Some of the scenes--even static ones--are simply breathtaking on the huge IMAX screen in a way that wouldn't I think translate to a smaller screen.Anyway, this is most definitely a Nolan movie--the cinematography is top-notch as always and the whole thing has a moody, weird, altered state reality vibe that's most reminiscent of ""Inception"". The time and science angle is more reminiscent of ""Interstellar"".And boy oh boy does this movie start with a bang. I don't think it's even 30 second in before all hell breaks loose.That said, while the action sequences are insane and the backwards-moving scenes are something you've never seen before, it's almost a Bond film in that the heroes are trying to stop the Russian bad guy from unleashing a doomsday device. That's really the gist of it.The backwards/forwards thing sometimes makes sense, but often times I got lost and decided just to roll with it, to ""feel"" it was one character says. I'm guessing the more views, the more this movie will make sense and those are the *best* kind of movies. I can say, having seen it just hours ago, that you can't stop thinking about it.Minuses: like every Nolan film, it's 30 minutes too long. The final battle scene is often confusing and chaotic--and long. Not quite as tight and easy-to-follow as the end of Inception. There's a lot of monologues that could have been trimmed. It can get extremely complicated (kind of like Interstellar did if you don't know anything about relative time). If you know the TV show ""Dark"" it can get that complex.But oh, how it looks.

1109,fmt-96-787608,Limitations to the Willing suspension of disbelief,3,2 October 2021,"Like King Midas in Greek mythology, Christopher Nolan has earned a reputation for turning everything he touches into gold, even when he tackles those convoluted subjects he's so fond of (Inception, Interstellar). Unfortunately even geniuses can sometimes go into pieces... Tenet is made up to divide. I, for certain, assume a clear-cut judgment: this film is abstruse, sterile, pretentious. Alas, a complete wreck.Nolan like a dream factory. And the dream factory gives birth to a two and a half hour blockbuster... that falls apart within the first hour. Cruel. On reflection, it is perhaps due to its long gestation (20 years) that might explain the failure of the film. Immersed in his research on the inversion of entropy (don't ask me to explain what it means), the filmmaker ended up losing sight of the fact that a film is no PhD in physics.Tenet is not a failure because its story is complex. It is a failure because the filmmaker does not want us to understand it - if that was possible. Due to a lack of basic information and knowledges, we are not capable of investing ourselves because nothing encourages us to do so: neither the characters, nor the interpretation (excepting the brilliant Robert Pattinson), nor even the so confusing action. Let's concede that the film is nervous, its aestetics is amazing, which allows us to stay awake during the two and a half hours of projection.If Tenet is the Nolan's James Bond, then, good Lord, in your infinite goodness, please don't let Christopher ever have access to this franchise.

1112,SenorLengua,"Inverted ranking of the ""time trilogy""",7,20 December 2020,"Christopher Nolan likes his characters to have an experience with time in his original and unique movies. We see that in Memento, The Prestige, and most clearly in Inception and Interstellar. And to a lesser degree, he does this in is other movies as well, such as Insomnia (lack of sleep) and Dunkirk (the silent last flight). So, once again, we see him exploring time in Tenet.What is obvious from the trailer is that the main characters experience time backwards. This presents a difficulty in storytelling in that the script needs to keep moving forward, yet bring this ""inversion"" into action. Of course, Nolan is skilled at this, and he does so very well. Then non-linear timelines of the four main characters are not possible as far as the story goes, yet there is not much confusion as to when the characters are in the script Again, this is credit to Nolan, clearly building on his past experiences.Unfortunately, Nolan tries to do too much with this movie. He has to bring in ideas like ""inversion,"" ""time stile,"" and ""temporal pincer movement,"" ideas which are not laymen's terms, if they've existed previously, and not only explain them, but keep them consistent throughout the movie. Sure, this is possible if not wanting to go into any detail about what could happen to the characters, but Nolan has never been that kind of writer/director. While the consistency is present for the first half the movie, the second half lacks this consistency. Understandably, this could be practically difficult to achieve, but with a director like Nolan and a budget of over $200 mil, this should have occurred.Additionally, there are other unNolan like gaps in logic and expectations that he wants the audience to accept. As an example, if you have seen Inception, think of the top that Cobb has. He takes the time to explain its meaning. In Tenet, the thing they are after is just a thing, yet he wants it to have some great meaning and power, yet it is hardly explained. (He also gave it a rather ordinary name considering his ability to come up with unique names.)Of course, it is easy to point out the problems. After watching the movie, it seemed like it was the third of some kind of ""time trilogy,"" the first two being Inception and Interstellar. That being the case, this was by far the worst of the three. But it is still a Nolan movie, and still rather good.As for the actors...well, I'll be brief. John David Washington as the Protagonist (actual character name) is good but underwhelming more often than not. Robert Pattinson as Neil, the partner, does well and seems to have fun with his role. As does Elizabeth Debicki, the female lead (though in a movie as bold as this, her delicate subtly gets lots from time to time). But the best of them all, probably not unexpectedly, is Kenneth Branaugh as Sator, the antagonist. Watch the movie for him alone, as he outshines everybody. (I also liked the small role that Dimple Kapadia played as Priya.)Despite all I have written, this movie is definitely watchable, and enjoyable, and just like both Inception and Interstellar, you will have missed something the first viewing. It is also long at two and half hours, and the last 30 minutes are quite intense, so be warned. I'm also reviewing this in the context of the excellence of Inception and Interstellar, both as stories and with actors. The three movies, together, make up what I'm calling his ""time trilogy.""I rate this 6.5 (rounded up) out of 10 - This is a Nolan movie, so critiques are based on his own high standards.There is no sex, and some profanity, and as stated, the last 30 minutes are quite intense. Be warned if watching with kids under 15.",Tenet
1113,sfx-882-826031,2 1/2 Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back,2,29 September 2020,"Gave the two stars for the opening sequence in the opera house, which was intriguing and tense. After that, it was all downhill for me. I described this film as a James Bond film, where James Bond (Washington) goes to somewhere to meet someone, then he goes to somewhere else to get a thingy, and so on, and in every location, there's a plane crash, a car chase, a boat race and so forth.Here, interspersed we have some sort of inverted time plot that tries to be intelligent but is really quite nonsensical.At 1 hour and 45 minutes into it, I had lost the will to live.Previous reviewers mentioned the bad sound choices, explosions and sound track too loud, dialogue muffled and usually unintelligeble (if ever it made any sense, which I doubt sincerely, still, it would have been nice to be able to hear it).I will also add the total lack of human traits in the characters, notably the two main protagonists, notably the star/hero (Washington). I'm shaking my head as I'm writing this.I would also say that Brennagh's performance was incredibly disappointing. Not once did I feel real menace from him. I have no idea what happened, he has proven he can act, and I think this may be an indication of the essential problem with this movie.The director failed to elicit performances from the actors; had no interest in the characters, was too focused on the special effects and clearly in love with this inversion thing.If you go nuts at the idea of time inversion, this is the movie for you. If you don't, well ... good luck to you.",Tenet
1114,thezonda,An Amazing Experience!,10,2 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan may have out-Nolaned himself with Tenet. It has every element you've come to expect from a Nolan film, and some that you don't. Saw this last night in Imax and still can't quit processing it in my head. While admittedly confusing at times, the twists unfolded with such beautiful precision that somehow manage to blow your mind and send chills tingling down your spine at the same time. I can't wait for a second viewing to try and dissect more of the clues hidden throughout the film.I was disappointed that Zimmer couldn't compose for Tenet, as he is a true regular in Nolan's world. However, Ludwig Göransson did a more than admirable job laying out a tension filled score in his absence.Tenet is the rare film that has enough shock value and wow factor to truly inspire and leave its viewers in awe. Much like Inception, it requires the viewer's upmost attention and a second (and even third) viewing are likely to be just as exciting as the first as you figure out more and more. Tenet might not save movie theaters from extinction, but the experience we had seeing it perfectly illustrates why we would really be missing out if theaters start to close down throughout the world.",Tenet
1115,agferg,"Just OK - poor sound editing, mediocre acting and storyline",5,5 February 2021,"John Washington, as an actor, has a lot of potential I believe. However, in too many scenes in this movie he looked and sounded like he was just reading lines. That's disappointing for a movie of this stature. The sound editing was also subpar, admittedly based on the fact that oftentimes in the movie characters are wearing masks. However the dialogue channel relative to the special effects really needs to be increased. Finally, the storyline while fun and provocative, was more than confusing. Multiple times it was illogical and broke with its own internal rules and conventions. I have no problems with movies that create a ""new universe"" with new rules, but when they then break those rules as they do in this movie, it's frustrating at best. I would not recommend this movie to most people.",Tenet

1117,pablobiedma,We've had enough pseudo-intellectualism,5,2 October 2020,"If you are a Nolan fan, wait, before hitting the dislike button, read the whole review, please.Marketing has been destroying cinema for years, and this movie is a clear example of it.For some reason, today's generation thinks that the more plot twists a movie has, the better it is. They couldn't be more wrong.Christopher Nolan became famous for making dumb people think they are smart.Please note, that I am not against movies that are difficult to understand e.g. ""Blow Up"" (Antonioni) or ""Persona"" (Bergman). As long as it's a meaningful difficulty in a good movie. And this one is not. Here's why:The acting was really poor. The main character had a very small screen presence, he didn't look like a badass like he was supposed to, he didn't even know how to walk like one.The only kind of interesting character is perhaps Robert Pattinson's character. The rest, are tremendously dull.This movie is not pleasant for cinephiles to watch as it doesn't have any of the two main things we look for in a movie: 1- It's not appealing technically, and 2- it has no emotional depth since it doesn't empathize the principle of intention and obstacle due to the poorly developed narrative.The first part of the movie, or most of it, where nothing happens, seems like a bad campaign mode from a shooting videogame.Some scenes are so dull that Nolan had to add the soundtrack for action scenes to them. This music was so annoying as it wasn't properly used.In the highway scene, the protagonist stopped the car with two fingers... Everyone in the audience was laughing at that scene...The use of fake science to try to justify the narrative is just a lame element.Nolan spent more narrative effort, trying to make you realize, you didn't get something in the plot, than actually presenting it in a good way in the first place. A clear example of this is the scene where he zooms in an 'orange string' from a character's backpack and then he does it again later, to reveal that it was the same character. (He did it for an unnecessarily long time so everyone could realize). These sorts of scenes are extremely unenjoyable for me and unproductive for a good narration of the story.He just does this to increase the ego of young people watching this film who are probably just a bunch of pseudo-intellectuals.In conclusion, again, this is a clear example of how marketing, hype, and pseudo-intellectualism together with many other elements, are destroying the film industry.",Tenet

This was action-packed, brilliantly paced from the get-go, and filled with plenty of ""A-ha!"" moments that felt both surprising and inevitable. I'm docking one star off because at times it felt a little emotionally uneven and I found myself wanting slightly higher emotional stakes besides the thrill of the action. A re-watch would probably be a 10/10 experience (no spoilers but it's one of those films that probably hits different once you know the ending) but as it stands I was left wanting a little more heart.

While Inception a visual spectacle, Tenet was a 'how did they do that?!' type movie. All performances were stellar, the camera work was spot on, stunts were mind-blowing at times, enough comedy to cover for some of the darker moments, and a soundtrack that threatens to match Hans Zimmer with Ludwig (I'm too scared to spell his second name), fresh off the iconic score to The Mandalorian.

If it comes complexity and perplexing screenplay Tenet is the best of all even in Nolan's direction. This movie is visual feast and I'm so lucky I got to see it in IMAX . Very well acted ,flawlessly choreographed and wonderfully shot Tenet is just like it's name a world where a protagonist must prevent sudden attempts of the greatest threat leading to World war 3 but he has to do it in an inverted world where he is conventional but world is running backward . Christopher Nolan, again proved himself one of the most innovative directors working .My only issue with this movie is its emotional aspect , frail in that section.....
. if we talk about The Dark Knight trilogy each movie villain has a reason a philosophy behind them and a dialogue ""I will come to you when you won't be needing that mask "". In Inception Cobb accepted the offer because he made a mistake and he couldn't do the same to his children, the Guilt of a father when he didn't listen to her daughter and got stuck in a never ending loop ........ the same Guilt of another father who sent her daughter for hope knowing there is none left , the fear of death experiencing it every second on a beach in Dunkirk........ those emotional threads Nolan tied in his previous works were fully ignored in Tenet . The concern of a mother protecting her only child , betrayal of lover; these things weren't built forcefully ........and the villain who I thought was doing all this because love of his life left her but it turned out something very simple I won't reveal it but it's not that important he plays a pure evil person that's it. Apart from this Tenet is a thrill ride extraordinary visuals ,things inverting and moving in normal order together I don't know how they even managed to edit that it's so great I can't Express my feelings for them.This time not Hans Zimmer but oscar winner Ludwig Göransson thrills us with his astounding score , I'm 100% certain Hoyte van Hoytema will win an oscar this time .

The positive point is the amazing production of the movie and great camera work (I have absolutely no idea how you can create such a scenes and how can you act or film events like that) and the performance of all cast are great and believable

Pretty simple isn't it?The result may not like to many, and that's fine, it really doesn't need to, as long as some of us does.I really didn't like it much Dunkirk thoug, so i took this one as an improvement. But this is just my taste.I do recommend it but watch it more than once, if you can.",Tenet
1138,SimonsRants,Honest Review from a Fan,8,1 September 2020,"Tenet - 8/10Edit: Gets better with a second viewing, but I've left in my initial review notes that are still applicable.The biggest problem with the film - as many have pointed out - is that it is hard to understand. No, not because the ideas and plot are too complex (keep in mind, I am a big fan of his work) but rather because the story-telling is honestly sloppy at times, especially during the first act. It feels like Tenet is either missing an hour of footage that the studio forced Nolan to remove or it has an hour too much footage that only serves to muddle the plot. Either adding or removing could have fixed this issue. But how it is, the exposition comes in fast and heavy while seemingly pointless actions are being acted out. I just saw the movie yesterday and components of the plot are already slipping away into obscurity - why did he visit the arms dealer? What was the point of the painting? And so on. It all seemed like it was leading from one thing to another without any clear goal in sight and could have all been cut from the final version without missing anything. And as we introduce new characters we never get to know any of them or anything about them and are only convinced that they have any sort of importance because they are played by well-known actors and simply continue to exist on the screen. We are supposed to feel as connection between Washington's and Pattinson's characters but it never becomes apparent why as they never seem to have any sort of chemistry or bonding whatsoever.Of Nolan's strengths it is well known that character development is not among them, nor is getting great performances out of actors - Heath Ledger's Joker being the outlier. He is a much more idea and story centered director and is fabulous at coming up with unique, different, and complex ideas and then crafting equally complex and astounding stories around and through those ideas. Case in point - Inception. A brilliant idea told beautifully with an equally brilliant story that embodies the idea that it is there to present. The ideas in and behind Tenet are equally unique and fascinating, but the story? The story is quite honestly a non-factor. It's muddled, confused, and ill-paced as it breezes by at times and drags at others. So without a sufficient plot of interesting characters we are left only with the idea behind Tenet which is fascinating, but not enough to make this movie worthy of Nolan's reputation.Definitely worth a watch, especially so for ""Nolanites"" but will not have the impact or staying power as Inception, The Prestige, Memento or The Dark Knight. Furthermore, I don't believe it to live up to Interstellar either and possibly even not Dunkirk or Insomnia. Not to say it's his worst film - I leave Following and the Dark Knight Rises to fight for that prestigious title - but farther from his best than his worst. Yet still, a middling Nolan film is good enough to rank as the best film of a catastrophic 2020 thus far. Hopefully, however, we cannot still say the same by the time our Top 10 Films of 2020 lists start coming out.",Tenet

I have to admit I watched only the first 45 minutes of it. I gave up, no clue what I was watching. I hate that, I don't like puzzles. A movie should not be a puzzle, maybe for a short time in the beginning but then at some point it has to draw you in and that makes you keep watching. It didn't happen with this one.

That was cool. Really, I'm all for some fresh experimental stuff, but I had some issues with this movie. Yeah yeah, downvote this if you like but here are my reasons why I didn't like this movie:* The science and physics don't add up. I understand scifi can stretch things as far as they like and movies about magic or even Superman don't make any sense either, but reverse time by seeing bullet holes before they happened.. come on man. They're trying to be smart but it's just dumb. Past, present and future.. at the same time.. during action, when one influences the other... yeah maybe inside of a black hole but unless I missed the setting completely there was no black hole to be seen.* The music was aweful and distracted me from the movie.* Did you ever watch a movie and you could just see an actor acting.. like you weren't feeling it? You just saw a man trying too hard to be a character? Yeah, I had this with that billionair.In the end it's a matter of personal taste I guess. It's ok for people to like this movie, as it is ok for me to think it was a stupid story with bad acting and very bad music. Seriously, 7/10? For this? Nah.",Tenet

1149,faerlian,"Necessary to watch twice, preferably with subtitles. Original Review 28/8/2020",8,16 September 2021,"It's somewhat ironic that a movie about time travel can't be reviewed properly until your future self rewatches the movie.It's bold of Nolan to make such a thoroughly dense blockbuster. He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or a 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also wayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:""Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen"").I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.It's worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand what's going on the first time around.",Tenet
1150,beeblebrox-2,A Challenging Masterpiece That Expects Much of its Audience,10,27 September 2020,"Original, enthralling, challenging.Nolan does it again. Like his other two time-bending masterpieces, Inception and Interstellar, Tenet asks a lot of the audience. You won't get the plot if you don't also grasp the director's approach to time as a literal physical property and that information is forever.If you don't want to be challenged by a complex plot intertwined with a scientific ""what if'"", then this isn't for you. You'll leave the theater and write a one star review of the movie saying stupid stuff like ""this isn't scientifically possible"".With Tenet, Nolan solidifies his status as Hollywood's leading auteur filmmaker.By the way, Tenet gets better with subsequent viewings.",Tenet

The third act is full of glorious action and its very hard not to be entertaining even though you have absolutely no idea what it going on. The plot is nearly impossible to understand and the film feels unnecessary confusing. Its hard for me to enjoy films that I cant understand which kind of ruined my enjoyment of Tenet and I liked the film a lot more the second time around where I was able to understand it a little bit better.

1158,tinjo23,It's simply insane to watch the sheer scale of these ideas unfold on screen. Price of admission insane!,9,23 August 2020,"Ouch, Ow! My simple human brain..For those who feel Nolan is a director that makes his movies unnecessarily complex should be warned, he could honestly care less. 'Tenet' is as complicated and mind boggling as it gets.Though for what has been something of a staple for Nolan, however intricate his movies may be, the plot is actually almost always a simple one.'Inception' is about a man trying to get home to his children. 'Interstellar' is about a group looking for an alternate planet. 'Batman Begins' is about Zap, Boom, Pow and also about facing your personal demons and such.'Tenet' is about saving the world and that's all you really need to know.The real question is, does it work? The answer, ironically, only the future will tell. There is too much too compact in a single viewing to really know if it all makes sense (at least in the case for my tiny man brain). First round opinions may come down to how much faith you have in Nolan. His past movies have proven he's a director all about the details, so it's hard to believe there isn't logic and structure all up in this beast.About the only thing that is for certain is the scale and blockbuster pizzaz. People fight forward in time, people fight backwards. People move forward in time while fighting people moving backwards. It's simply insane to watch the sheer scale of these ideas unfold on screen. Price of admission insane. The Nolan pizzaz has yet to disappoint.***No spoilers, but I will hint at the standout moment..... A bleeding arm, a helmet and a call back. Genius!***Also on screen are a cast of gifted actors, working hard to make insanity seem rational. John David Washington earning a future action-star persona, Pattinson earning his soon-to-come Batman persona. Elizabeth Debicki earning the film it's heart and soul and Kenneth Branagh doing all that he can to tear down that heart and soul...and Batman and the action star.Emotion wise, this may be Nolan at his most straight forward. Most character's have little backstory or emotional stakes to the game other than doomsday = bad for everyone. But there is plenty of life breathed in from the characters acting based mostly on instinct or reaction to whatever's been placed in front of them. A pretty apt way of looking at Nolan's latest as a whole to be honest.As Clemence Poesy's scientist Laura states early in the movie 'Don't try to understand it... feel it.'",Tenet

1160,buckybit,Tedious technical exercise which lacks humanity and purpose.,1,11 June 2021,"Yes, you read this right. Christopher Nolan's TENET is way overrated. Much so, by an audience who wants to convince you that 'you just don't get it'.But we all do. Especially, if you know your movie history and have watched your way from the beginning until today.Let's start at the beginning.Kenneth Branagh gets to replay his Russian oligarch from the Tom Clancy movie. Poor Elizabeth Debicki get's to replay her exact same character from ""The Night Manager"", only this time, she gets to do a lot less. In another cameo, the exact same gas masks from the time travelleing video game by Remedy Entertainment, called ""Quantum Break"" appear again. A video game. Yes.What is Nolan doing that is so original? Nothing.""Reverse shots"" have been in movies since the beginning as a technique. In TV advertisement they are commonly used and even mockingly by actors walking backwards in the background, just as easter eggs and for amusement, for those who took a closer look.What Nolan is doing - and has apparently written - is an excuse for him to solve some technical puzzles, he seems to be interested in. Only him, and his 'followers', who swallow every shot as it was a brand new taste of something else. But it is not. This movie has no purpose. The characters are more caricatures. ""I always wanted to make a Bond movie"" is something I read Nolan saying about ""Tenet"" in an interview. Well, even the worst Bond movies have something that this movie lacks completely: a human touch. Characters which are obsessed, but also in pain.Nolan's version of reverse shots as a feature length movie only boggles the mind of the weak and willing, I am afraid.",Tenet

1162,doalvarez2002,Was the camera crew drunk?,3,1 December 2020,"I couldn't make sense of this film even with subtitles, not because of the constant dribble they talk, but due to the lack of clarity in pronunciation. Some of the actors, like J.D. Washington, badly need enunciation lessons.Then the scene with Michael Caine and JD Washington at the restaurant seems as if the two actors hadn't filmed it together, because there is not a single camera frame showing they are seated at the same table at the same time. Check it out and you will see for yourself. Then in that restaurant scene the cameraman drove my eyes nuts: the camera was trained on either of them for every single line they said. In that single short scene the camera bounces off from actor to actor more than thirty times. Crazy for the eyesight. It puts you to sleep in the hours of darkness if you are lying in bed or lying on the couch after a copious lunch.The storyline unfolds at the speed of light which makes it so convoluted that even subtitles won't help you make sense of it all. You have to have a degree in physics. I don't think that will even help.If you are having trouble getting off to sleep one night or have run out of sleeping pills, play this film for five minutes and the constant switch in camera angles will make your eyes roll and you will be out for the count in less than five minutes.Do not waste your time on this film which could have had more potential if they had dumbed down the script and hired a different cameraman.",Tenet

""Inception"" took a few viewings but now it's one of my favorites. ""Tenet"" could have been the same, but lead actor John David Washington absolutely killed it for me. Dull, unemotional, uninteresting, sucking the life out of every scene he's in...which is almost all of them. What was Nolan thinking with this guy? In my mind's eye I kept trying to insert Idris Elba or Chiwetel Ejiofor in the part, but it didn't help. What a shame. Although the story was incredibly complex and hard to follow much of the time, a better lead actor could have gotten me much more invested and willing to maybe even give it another try.",Tenet

I can't explain it if I tried... And its understanding will probably hinge on 30 seconds in the dead center of the movie (literally the mid point in the mid third of the movie). Miss it, and you'll need a second, maybe even a third watch.
Nolan is as always a mad genius... Washington is keeping on cementing his presence in the industry and Pattinson is a calm, consistent pillar to the movie! Debicki provided that emotional weight to the story brilliantly and Branagh is a solid villain.
Music is one of the best aspects of the movie and the cinematography/effects deserve an Oscar unequivocally.

1166,lawrencep0,Bonkers but brilliantly realised,8,6 September 2020,"The retrocausality of our reality being the cumulative interactions of fundamental particles travelling forward and backwards in time is an actual scientific theory/speculation. To translate this into macro objects and people is bonkers. However, Nolan has brilliantly imagined and realised this into something of a consistent storyline. Deep respect and I really enjoyed it. Who doesn't love a pincer movement in time?The cinematography, acting and action scenes were spot-on.Understandably, there are some plot issues. How can there not be when positing a deeply paradoxical reality? I list the following simply because I like coherence and these strike off-notes and not simply to be accepted as paradoxes. Also, I have only seen it once and possibly have missed something and so am ready to be corrected.1. Whilst the overall premise is somewhat shielded by repeated reference to the Grandfather Paradox the evil intent goes beyond this i.e. apparently expecting the future environment to be changed for the better but their own existence to be unaffected. Seems incompatible thinking to me unless perhaps they selflessly intended some sort of blind reset hoping for a better future for the universe?2. The explanations also mixed QM interpretations with reference to many-worlds to sidestep a question from our protagonist.3. Our protagonist sees the start of a fire and experiences a fire but we are meant to understand that he was going in the opposite direction in time so it was actually cooling?4. It is mentioned that under no circumstance can a time-traveller physically touch their other-selves but this seems to posit some special status to our constituent particles rather than others which is unwarranted.I like the method of communicating to the future by simply writing something down! Communicating back in time by sending something inverted. Presumably people going back 20 years would have to travel back for 20 years? One gets inverted by these turnstiles and presumably can only stop going back in time with a turnstile? Unclear what happened to people travelling backwards before the 1st turnstile was created - presumably kept going back? Also seems as though there will end up being multiple simultaneous copies of a time-traveller going in the same direction? For instance, the blue team must have switched back to going forward and their original selves must also be going forward in the same timeframe? Or a timeloop?I am also not sure about this hiding of the algorithm in time. Presumably just 'before' the algorithm-creator decided to destroy/hide them in time that was a vulnerable spot for a future time-traveller to intercept them without the need for this dead-drop?I probably need to watch again and may update this review. However, as stated, it can never actually make sense of course and is mainly just great fun.",Tenet

I will always be a fan of Nolan for bringing such unique movies to the table where sequel prequel remakes and even other source material adaptation (books or comics) are becoming the norm, he always brings something people have not seen or heard before. His movies are an experience at this point and this movie is no exception. The way Nolan films ""inversion"" and the action sequences which it brings along with it are some of the best you'll see.

Tenet is just mind blowing, intriguing, a-can't-miss from Nolan I think it's the most beautiful concept to this time he ever done even know I love Inception more because of the cast, production design and costume design and maybe because it was bit easier to get than Tenet ahah but Tenet's concept is definitely more complex and beautiful. I'm not gonna lie I came to a point in the movie where I gave up trying to understand and I was just watching till the end so I can't wait a few days to watch it again I completely get everything only in my third watch this is just typical Nolan he's the only one you have to watch his movies at least twice to get it and you'll obviously forget this understanding so after 5 years you'll have to watch it again if you want to understand so that's the case with Tenet.The only thing I didn't like in Tenet would be production design and set decoration but after that it's just a wonder to watch.I would totally recommend it if you dig into those kind of story and while we're at it try The time traveler's wife, Mr Nobody, Predestination all great ones.",Tenet

Also there are some scenes that movie just asks to turn off your brains, because some things just doesn't make sense. But in other scenes it asks audience to think and carefully follow what's going on. So it makes the experience unpleasant. Director himself said that it requires multiple viewings to appreciate it. But every movie if you see it around 10 times you would know it by heart and get it, but the movie going experience for me isn't about that.",Tenet
1179,delsoca,The most complex sci fi movie I have seen,9,4 September 2020,"Went to see ""Tenet"" last night.The acting is good, lots of action but it's seriously complicated. It involves time travel and you see the past, Present and future in some scenes at the same time.The score is a bit loud in places and in some parts the actors mubble a little.If sci fi is your things it's worth a watch, but it's a difficult film to understandThe set piece action scenes are amazing and it's a film which will require a second or third viewing.Nolan has a vision which is unique so different to any other director, his films are always thought provoking.Washington and the rest of the cast are excellent, Pattinson, Debicki and Branagh are faultlessBranagh is very menacing and puts in an excellent turn.I have scored the film an 9, but I feel this will go up on further viewings.Somethings are not meant to be easy, if you want simple watch Disney......... don't let the negative reviews about complexity put you off, its worth a watch.",Tenet

I know Nolan is a master of complexity like running 3 scenes at the same time but due to the poor audio mixing, couldn't follow at all. In addition Branagh as a Russian! That was a joke!

Just a lost cinematographer masquerading as an intellectual. Intelligence is making the complicated understandably simple, not the opposite. Without Jonathan's scripts and sense of direction, a Christopher Nolan movie is nothing more than a mess of fancy and expensive nonsense.

1183,crsunblast,"A Good, Solid Movie, but a bit Derivative",8,8 September 2020,"First of all, I must say that Tenet is well worth your time. It's a good, solid, spy thriller with a bit of twist on time travel. However, it seems that the movie struggles a bit with the intelligence of its intended audience. The most disappointing thing to me was that I correctly guessed all of the ""twists"" in the plot long before they were revealed. The script just seemed a bit naive and ham-handed in that respect... they were just too obvious. Maybe I've just seen too many ""time travel"" movies. I knew how the movie was going to end about 30 minutes in, and I think a lot of other people will, too. Definitely don't watch ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" prior to seeing Tenet, if you haven't already seen it, as a lot of the same concepts are re-hashed.On the bright side, it is an engaging movie. The performances of John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Elizabeth Debicki are solid. Washington does a great job of portraying a ""newbie"" intelligence agent... at first you think it's just bad acting, then you realize it's part of the character. It was great to see Pattinson in an intelligent, adult role... and he does quite well in it.",Tenet
1184,tk-72543,Disappointed,3,28 December 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie but this is really different from other Nolan films such as Interstellar, Memento or Inception. Looks like Nolan has passed his golden ages, this movie was boring, confusing and with no character development at all. I forced myself to watch the whole 2h 30 minutes of the film without any sense of enjoyment. People rating this 6+ would be because this is a Nolan Movie.",Tenet
1185,Nick_Milligan,"7 stars for the staging, but Nolan has jumped the shark...",7,1 November 2020,"Christopher Nolan has flirted with calamity, most apparently in the flawed Interstellar. His desire to over-complicate narratives, deep dive into lofty concepts and surprise his audience with ""how clever am I?"" twists has, at times, been at the expense of characterisation and sustained dramatic tension. It smacks of Shyamalan.
Nolan's mostly gotten away with it until now, because he's superbly talented, but in Tenet he serves up a convoluted entanglement that likely makes sense upon fine dissection, but doesn't work dramatically. Tenet feels like a two-hour physics lecture, albeit one delivered with Nolan's undeniable visual flair and robust penchant for mind-bending in-camera effects. But this is ultimately a writer-director in an act of self-aggrandisement in which he treats his loyal viewership, perhaps subconsciously, with a level of disdain.
#Tenet might have worked better as a limited TV series, which would have given Nolan more time to deepen the characterisation and make us feel as if there's something at stake. But Nolan still takes 150 minutes to convey Tenet and its palindromic idea. He reduces his characters to bloodless pawns, filling their mouths with expository dialogue that is often delivered so quickly by the cast that it's actually unintelligible. By forcing his audience to run maths equations in their mind as the action unfolds, essentially confused by what is happening, the kinetic, breathless set pieces don't have the same dramatic impact of those in his far more successful films like The Dark Knight, Insomnia or Inception. Tenet is a cool idea, and the spy thriller meets heist flick is a great framework, but the writing is messy. Nolan's core audience may soon become quantum physicists.
Despite these criticisms, John David Washington and Robert Pattinson are required to do a lot of heavy lifting to bring gravitas to the story and they're both excellent.",Tenet

1187,pluem_chaisiri,"Super original, as expected from Nolan",8,5 September 2020,"Not as good as I'd hoped it would be, but still above standard, as you would have expected from Nolan.This film has a very smart concept. It's super original, but it's quite complex. And, if you're not paying attention, you'll probably end up walking out of the cinema confused. It's definitely not for casual viewers. I suspected that is why the film doesn't have higher ratings.The casts are good. Robert Pattinson played his character pretty well, but his character could had been developed more. John David Washington is great as the lead. Never watched any of his film before, so I didn't know what to expect. At first, I find him to be too plain for the role, but as the story progressed, he turned out to be quite charming.The ending of the film felt a bit anticlimactic. I was expecting an ending that is unpredictable and left me wanting more like Inception. This one didn't make me feel like that at all, but nevertheless, it was good overall. I probably need to see it again though.",Tenet
1188,Grey_rainbow,"Rushed, doesn't give time to absorb, savor, and wonder.",6,29 November 2020,"Tenet, like Inception, is a very creative sci-fi. But in Tenet, unlike Inception, you will just understand what's happening but not absorb it. When you absorb something you wouldn't have to consciously analyze what's happening and carefully interpret every word the characters say, it all becomes an instinct, like driving a car.In scientific publishing, one of the main objectives is to write one's findings in as simple a way as possible and provide a sufficient amount of introduction so that the reader has developed an intuition for the stuff by the time the main findings are presented (I should know I am a scientist). But this sci-fi movie presents the main ingredients in such a rushed and messy way that it takes away the fun of watching a movie by forcing the viewer to put them all together even near the climax as if by consciously processing the steps of a long math problem. Everyone will understand what's happening, but at the cost of not enjoying it. And also movies are not books, you don't get to reread or pause whenever you want. So a movie, by design, has to either dumb down things or not present too many things. Tenet tries to present too many things and not in an easily perceivable form (like all the plans and the lingo).Another thing that bugged me a lot is that the movie does not spend enough time on reverse time flow in the beginning. There is just one scene at a wall in the beginning that's the whole Tenet world building in the movie. This is the main reason why the subsequent big things fail to impress or rather register at a deeper level (like in matrix or inception).Nolan has misfired twice since Inception now, Interstellar had a daft climax (I mean love in a sci-fi, I am still p**sed off about it) and Tenet was even worse (because Interstellar can be enjoyed until the very end). Hope the writing gets better in the future and we get another Inception or Prestige.",Tenet

In my opinion, he failed to express the concept of inversion thoroughly by making the story line too much complex and rushing everything!! I think the idea of such an extraordinary concept is amazing and pretty heavy and require better scaffold to engage the audience. I was totally lost to the point that I was having a headache from the unnecessary complexity and very poor sound quality. The background music was super loud and you could barely here the dialogues!
Sometimes a great movie is not only about being super confusing bc that will disengage the audience!!

The techinal aspects of it were really good, particulary the action and the effects, and the acting was, albeit not something stellar, was a more than decent one. I liked the characters, for the most part, even if they are a little sketchy, and stereotypical at times (particularly the evil russian TM). The first half and hour of the movie felt a little rush, but I don't complain, since the plot is already pretty complex for a 2 hour and a half movie, but they managed to get it right and never make it seem to long in the end. About the time travel aspect, as I said, it is well crafted, although it may have it's flaws. Overall, a pretty decent blockbuster to enjoy. Not outlandish, but solid and thoroughly enjoyable.

The great scoring with shepard tone is also always his favorite part when working with great composer.This masterpiece's scoring was composed by Ludwig Göransson instead of Hans Zimmer but everything feels all right.
This motion picture is as confusing as how it is supposed to be though it has great script and non anticlimactic story.The build up does not feel to tell the audience about what's going on also the direction is intense in every single scene even with lack of details throughout the film that bothers the audience. It should be watched more than once to make up audience's mind and in order to understanding the plot. ""Preventing World War 3"" part does not really catch audience's attention in my opinion because we only wonder the motive behind every character does.It is Sci-Fi titled but reversion and time travel are captured realistically better than any movies that have done the common formula.

If you know Chris Nolan and you are not smart or like an intense experience, don't watch it, but don't give it a bad review it only speaks bad of yourself not the Movie.First off the one major complain this movie has is that it is loud, and it is, but GLORIOUSLY loud, I felt the intensity on every scene thanks to the music and sound, I watched it with subtitles so I can say that most of the ""unhearable"" dialog, is not really that important, it is much more important to feel the intensity of the scene and my god does it deliver! It has been so long since my heart raced this much watching a movie, almost every scene is just as intense as the ""no time for caution"" scene in interstellar, which also has unhearable but not important dialog, yet it is one of the bests scenes of Interstellar.Second major complaint is that is not understandable, and to be honest is really not that much complicated, but a second view can really help to see the details and the reason this is just phenomenal. I mean you can argue that the story and script may not be exactly oscar worthy as it is majorly composed of pure exposition, but it is very well executed as it is and I dont like judging a film for what it is not, its like judging Schindler's List for the lack of Action, or Mad Max for the lack of Script, I mean sure its true but it doesn't make them any less awesome.I personally recommend watching this in IMAX if you can, be prepared to be confused and know that it is OK to be confused, try to focus on the experience it brings and watch it again if you want to understand things you did not on the first run. If you are generally close minded and like nothing but superhero simple and easy to follow stuff, don't even bother, but if you are open minded, like to think, to analyze perspectives and time, like intense feelings, and dive into a new experience unlike ever before, then I doubt you will be disappointed.",Tenet
1201,chloeurc,Another good one,8,7 September 2020,"My TENET Review
Film: 8/10
Pros & Cons:
(Minor spoilers)PROS:
1. The movie was visually and musically stunning! Every scene was shot unbelievably good, it's very well made with heavy awesome music playing throughout the intense scenes. This film was mostly shot with an IMAX camera and man you can tell. Instead of Hans Zimmer doing the soundtrack it's actually Ludwig Göransson, which is the composer of Black Panther and the Mandalorian which gives the film a different feel but SUPER cool.2. Good story with a great cast. The characters in the film become friends as your watching the movie progress it's great to watch. John David Washington is a good actor along with Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh as the villain and even Elizabeth Debicki really shines. Even though there aren't a lot of cast members, they are very good at what they do and deliver an intense cool story.3. If you love Christopher Nolan movies, you will love this one. He combines the Dark Knight Rises with Inception and Memento altogether. Not really so much Dunkirk and Interstellar though. He has a feel to his movies and you can definitely tell that you're watching a Chris Nolan movie, so for all the fans it makes you feel like you're watching another masterpiece again and you pretty much are.CONS:
1. Yes the rumors are true that it is very confusing. I was able to follow along for a long time but there was moments that I did get lost. There were times I was explaining what was going on to my sister sitting next to me and then times where she was explaining what was going on to me. It's very helpful to see the movie with a friend so that both of you can catch different things and then talk about it when the movie is over. In order to fully understand you have to watch the movie multiple times, but then again it is Nolan.2. The cast is small. Although the people that are in the movie do a good job, there aren't many big name people. When you're watching Inception it's a group of like five or six of them but this one isn't a whole squad it's very few people which if you're not into the main two to three characters you're not going to enjoy the film. The film would've been a lot better if he had cast just a couple more cool actors or actresses to join the heroes.3. We needed subtitles. There are a lot of scenes where the boys are wearing some kind of military or medical mask with accents and then they throw in dialogue on top of it. You have no idea what they're saying in some of the scenes. And if I remember correctly John David Washington is the only main character that actually has an American accent so if you're good with accents it won't bother you but there are countless other accents in the film which makes it extremely hard for some Americans to understand and really need subtitles. There were entire conversation scenes that were lost to me because I couldn't understand.All in all it was an amazing film though, better than Dunkirk in my opinion but not quite as good as The Dark Knight. If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan like I said you'll love this movie, you'll buy it on DVD put the subtitles on and watch it countless times over the years until you're a pro at mastering this plot. Much like all his other films it's really fun, super cool, has great music and a definite must see movie worth going back to theaters for.",Tenet

I didn't think I could have been more disappointed in a Nolan movie than Dunkirk. But I was with Tenent. I read a review elsewhere where the fist paragraph said something to the effect that this movie was perfect for BluRay because you could put subtitles on. I swear I couldn't hear half the dialog as the sound and music drowned it out. Some of the important dialogue, I think, was even given while the actors were wearing gas masks. Maybe the mix in the theater was off. But a number of other reviews have the same complaint. You'd think Nolan would have learned something from the Bane dialogue controversy. But he didn't. There might have been a good movie under all that sound, but I couldn't tell.As for the time travel stuff, I think I understood what they were getting at, but due to the inability to understand a lot of the dialogue coupled with too much action, I don't think he pulled it off.

I bought the Blu ray version asap and am still digesting.
It is a very difficult narrative to follow and contain, certainly. However, if you take the advice given in dialogue and just let it happen, something oddly cogent starts to occur.
The style, content and the involvement of the viewer is ineffably combined to encourage a new way of thinking.
It's not to say that this is applicable for all people but, my impression is that Tenet is less James Bond and more Inception. Whilst both films contain elements of old fashioned spy drama, this is more of an intellectual gift to the audience. It is the second part of a trilogy?
I deliberately exclude Memento as the confusion remains solidly centred at Guy Pierce's location in time.

1216,Kieran_Oneill,Highly disappointing,3,11 October 2020,"Let's start with the one thing I liked about the movie there is no CGI, that I noticed, alright now let's move on.
this entire movie is one info dump to another info dump, you get absolutely no time to process anything said in the film, what makes it even worse is, unlike Inception where they don't spend that much time actually explaining how Inception works and when they do it at least sounds like it makes a little sense, Tenet makes absolutely no sense it's just one nonsensical info dump after another. there's literally no story other than them trying to explain something that makes absolutely no sense.
I don't understand why there is a Damsel in Distress plot stuck in for no reason she does nothing the entire movie and is only there for the main character to save her, literally pointless. this movie breaks one of my Cardinal rules of filmmaking which is don't make your main plot about a world-ending event all it does is tear all tension out of the film especially because this is an action film, am I seriously supposed to believe that they are going to end the world or kill the main character because I know for a fact they won't, that's just how action films work, compare to any other Christopher Nolan film they don't have any world-ending events in them because they take the tension out of the film.
and don't get me wrong I'm a Christopher Nolan fan but I think that's why I'm so disappointed in this film because I know he can make good movies but he decided for whatever reason to go with a movie about cool set pieces instead of a movie that tells a good story and makes sense. and for those reasons, I would not recommend this to anyone.

1218,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,What a movie,9,26 August 2020,"Two men have a mission to prevent a Russian oligarch from ending the world and preventing a 3rd world war.
Tenet gives us an interesting premise, as is usual in Nolan's films, and takes us on an incredible and above all interesting journey, especially if you are admirers of this time travel theme, paradoxes etc. lead duo David Washington and Robert Pattinson present us with incredible chemistry and a mystery about the past and future which leaves a sense of intrigue that is able to capture attention throughout the entire film. The photography is incredible, contributing to the growing tension of the film and even better is the CGI that did the budget.
The negative points would be some expositivity in some dialogues and some action scenes are a little confusing, but nothing that will harm the experience.
An advice is to watch the film with the utmost attention and open mind.",Tenet
1219,zydonk,Just another caper?,7,6 December 2020,"The thing about capers is not the detail, it's men watching other men doing some interesting work. There will be busy-man philosophy and even some romance, enough to plug the upper and lower gaps - as it were - while the work is done, just as in real life.We usually get updates on the life and interests of the very rich while we have our plebian representatives get the caper-job done. But why bother with more detail, when no-one is interested? Especially complicated detail.In our modern machine-age it is not unusual to find talented technicians who want to be more than just technicians, probably because that is the nature of the machine: they are designed to serve some greater end, a combustion engine with wheels for instance.Nolan is such a technician: a superbly articulate film director who wants to say more than simple moving images can say. But what does Nolan want to say? It's about life, that's for sure. Look at how he pulls life apart and then tries to put it back together again. Here in TENET he uses time, where elsewhere he uses robotics, for instance. And what does he discover here? Yes, the obvious and banal answer he has always discovered about human life: no one wants to die. And his solution? Generation, of course: what other solution do we have?I watch these films just to pass idle moments, but even so I would suggest for the future that Nolan gives up this fruitless search. What he should do instead is examine a subject better suited to his skill, that has been examined fruitfully by many like him: he should study love, not life. One thing he will learn: he will no longer need capers, busy-man philosophy or teenage romance - love goes by itself, answers for itself most fulsomely.The points are for the said skill, that and the skill of those who helped him here.",Tenet
1220,brendanmcc02,Escapist cinema that enraptures and dazzles,8,31 August 2020,"Tenet is the film that proves that Christopher Nolan is, without a doubt, the most original, exciting and ambitious filmmaker currently working today.You have to respect the man, because he clearly has a vision; and in my eyes, his vision came to life with Tenet. It is a film that prides itself in the cinematic experience; it's more than just a trip to the cinema, it's an utterly compelling 150 minutes that engulfs you into another world. One of Nolan's ultimate purposes as a filmmaker is to have his audience immersed in a completely different world - and in the case of Tenet, it's a twilight world of espionage and time inversion.As written above, Tenet is a wildly original film, loaded with mind-bending concepts and fascinating ideas. It's a story where the audience can quickly get lost and disoriented, so Nolan's solution for this are the two-dimensional characters. Many have criticised Tenet for its uninteresting characters, however this was intentional by Nolan, and I believe that it is a strength rather than a weakness of the film. This is because the archetypal characters serve as the familiar anchor that the audience latches on to, as they experience a world they've never seen before.What I love about Nolan's films is that he often expresses ideas through the nature of the story or world; in the case of Tenet, Nolan explores the theme of fate - a theme that is inextricably linked to the nature of time travel, or rather Time Inversion. Throughout the film, there is a constant question of whether or not our actions are predetermined or if we have the potential to carve our own fate. As the story progresses, the Protagonist learns of the unfortunate reality that ""what's happened, happened"", realising that he is not in the complete control of his fate that he thought he once had. The expression of this theme feels so organic in Tenet because the story is built on the concept of time inversion, a concept that has a close connection with the film's main theme: fate.Is the film flawless? No. The dialogue is a bit clunky at times, to the point where you can tell that the characters on-screen are also getting tired at the exposition. The dialogue brings me on to the sound mixing: there were a handful of lines that I simply did not hear - even after a second viewing. It's something common in Nolan's films that I guess one has to get used to.Another possible flaw is the complexity of the film; on my first viewing I didn't fully understand it, but I did comprehend it to a point where I could feel the ratcheting tension and gargantuan spectacle that the scenes were conveying. On my second viewing, I understood a bit more (with the help of some YouTube videos). It made me realise that the complexity of the film isn't a flaw. Whether or not you fully understand time inversion doesn't make the freeway scene any less brilliant. So to surmise, the complexity of the film isn't a flaw in my view, as long as the audience feels something emotionally.Tenet is escapist cinema at its finest; Nolan clearly has the intention of immersing his audience in this twilight world - and he does more than just succeeding with Tenet. It's a film beset with enrapturing concepts, unbelievable spectacle and stimulating ideas, a film that represents the unfiltered vision of one Christopher Nolan.",Tenet
1221,seanfitz-51998,It's seems to be underrated by other critics,10,25 August 2020,I am shocked at how low a critics score it has. I have seen the movie twice and it's an amazing experience. I think if shall we say more movie fans went to see this movie it would be 8.7 or 8.6 at least.,Tenet

1223,movicus-63513,Another Nolan Masterpiece,10,13 September 2020,"I won't spoil the movie. I saw the movie last night and it was a great movie. I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan. I love his style of movies like; Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk. Those movies are of his work. Now Tenet and he did it again and with his own style, he created another masterpiece. Yes, Tenet is very complex and hard to follow. It's not like the Marvel movies or DC movies in which it's automatically easy to understand. You don't have to work hard and pay attention, but this movie forces you to have to think and figure it out like a math problem. If you don't get it, then you have to watch it again until you will get it. That's why I love Nolan, I know he always makes you really think about the plot. You can't say this movie is bad because you don't have to think and you can't understand Nolan's movies are a ""one time"" watching kind of movie. Watch it again and again until you get it. Again, it's like a math problem. I learned some people complained about how the sound mix was bad, and that the dialogue was hard to understand. I'm Deaf and I used CaptiView, closed captions at the movie theater. Try to use it and it will help you understand. Or you can wait until the rental release and turn on the subtitles. I would love to see it again. Recommend 10/10.",Tenet
1224,canerbaskurt,Why would you make a movie this confusing?,3,12 January 2021,A good movie is the one that would be understood without reading the plot from somewhere else or asking millions of questions to the other people.

I can solve puzzles if I really want something to confuse me.,Tenet
1225,fscouto_,A run against time,8,19 September 2020,"Tenet is a very powerful film. Not the best of the best by Nolan, but still, it rises above his commonly high quality. Plot speaking, we witness the usual time paradoxal complexity highened to ambitious levels: we see everything happening at the same time; past, future, entangled together. Some would say it lacks soul and afection for the characters (Nolan has already proved his talent in sentimental scripts). However, my interpretation is that it all comes together as a goal to show us what Robert Pattinson's Neil claims: the whole story is a conspiration, moving through the shadows of everybody's ignorance. The film is quite brilliant in every other aspect. It intercuts classic spy scenes with breathtaking action sequences, directed with such intensity the movie passes by like it was merely a few minutes long. A special praise for both the prologue and the final sequence: an almost insane run against time, remembering war scenarios. It is a movie one must see more than once, due to its complexity but also richness and detail. But it is a Nolan project, so, everyone knows it is really worth our time.",Tenet

1228,i-15037,"Don't try to understand, to feel the movie.",8,4 September 2020,"Perhaps Nolan's most brain-dead film to date. The first half is like a familiar spy action movie, while the second half is completely immersed in another kind of feeling never seen before. As many of you probably already know, this is a movie about time and space reversal, not the familiar time travel of the past. So, basically, it involves two dimensions and perspectives of the story, one is normal space-time, and one is the opposite of the reverse space-time.",Tenet
1229,safeatbase,Nolan,8,13 June 2021,"It seems that Nolan is a rare director/writer in that not only does he keep trying to outdo himself, he's successful at it. In the first viewing, you are able to keep up with the complexity of the movie but it comes at mentally running top speed for 2+ hours. So it is exhausting. You know what's happening, but you can't process it. Second viewing, a lot more comes in, especially now that it can be streamed and you can stop and rewind - something I did a handful of times.I won't say Nolan outdid himself in terms of characters (Dark Knight trilogy) or story (Inception), but he certainly outdid his story crafting. Watching the film over again, it's clear to see how well Nolan kept his story consistent and intelligent. It's difficult to find that in the vast majority of movies in general, let alone action films. Tenet is a movie I will choose to watch when I'm scrolling mindlessly because 1) I know I'll enjoy it; 2) I know I'll get more out of it; 3) I know I'll respect every cast and crew member for their skill even more than the previous viewing.

From the unique story, to the exquisite atmosphere it creates, to the phenomenal casting and acting, Tenet checks all the boxes for a 10/10 film for me. Nolan's writing is my favorite in the film industry, and I may be biased but I think he is the greatest filmmaker of the 21st century. The amount of detail and effort put into every shot of this film is just breathtaking. The more I watch it, the more I discuss the film with other fans, the more I learn about it and appreciate it even more so than I had prior. The only criticism I have with the film, as with a lot of people, was the mixing of the dialogue.

After 10, I stopped understanding why the story mattered.
After 15 minutes, I became genuinely disinterested.

And SCRIPT.Tenet was the least well lit movie I have ever seen. With all its budget, it should have felt lush and vibrant, but instead felt cold as ice and just plain boring to watch.It's unfortunate how not good this movie is:
VISIONARY DIRECTOR - overstepping the boundary between understandable/relatable and incoherent/irrelevant.
COMPETENT ACTORS - not given much of a dialogue/story to work with
GREAT LOCATIONS - not utilised by poor editing, lighting and uninspired cinematography.Tenet wasn't painfully unpleasant to watch, but just barely.

Right from the start the sound was terrible, making it very difficult to understand the dialogue which didn't help in trying to understand a very convoluted story. The basic premise is interesting enough but I believe there is far too much focus on the big action sequences for it's own good. Yes some of the scenery and cinematography are fantastic but they seem to be there just for the sake of it and actually detract from the story line. There are clumsy attempts at both the beginning and the end to explain how the plot works but the middle 90% is just loud noise and confusion. I can't even see myself watching it again in order to work out what is going on in each of the scenes. Over-hyped and very dissatisfying..",Tenet

I am sure that people who dive into the details will find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story.
No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the financial background to complete his plans.
I think the main flaw of this movie that the viewer can feel unsatisfied at the end due to the complex setup and this brutal backwards mechanics.",Tenet

But this is a crapfest. It's utter garbage.1) The dialog. It's too scripted-sounding, rapidfire, and doesn't give you time to take it in. Worse is that it's delivered in a monotone devoid of any human emotion. Oh, wait, no, what's even worse than that is that it's mumbled and then there's the loud music overlaid on top of that. I am a native speaker and literally couldn't make out about 60% of the dialogue. Extremely frustrating.2) The entire inversion concept is so stupid you can't get your head around it. It's not ""wow I can't understand this super smart concept"". It's just dumb. Reverse entropy moving forward in time but actually, no, it's backwards but.... yeah, whatever. It's stupid beyond belief. You just can't let yourself get sucked into the story. At least I couldn't.I really wish I had just rewatched Interstellar instead. What a waste of time.",Tenet

It may be considered a masterpieces on a second watch but who has time for that. Movies should be entertaining not hard work. Plus if you rented this you would not rent it twice. If you have to watch a film twice then for me it's failed. I just got bored with it partly due to the shocking sound quality and I did not really care about the characters. The film is sometimes visually good which was the only reason I did not give up on it. The acting was good but it was not enough to capture ones interest. All in all it was a bit of a confusing mess.

Explosions, shooting, jumping and jiving, a bad guy, a good guy,, a friend, and of course the girl who is rescued by the good guy and on the side he saves the world. So you don't have to see it twice, as some comments suggest to do. Just ignore lines as: Nice to have spoken to you in the future some years back. In fact it's just Back to the Future without humor.

Nolan's movies tend to think they're smarter then they really are (a big problem I had with interstellar), and this one suffers from the same problem, but 2.5 hours passed relatively fast, I can't say i didn't have fun watching it, however i don't plan on rewatching it.",Tenet

1250,jke_up,This maybe should have been two movies instead of one.,8,23 December 2020,"The action & effects happening on screen are enough to give this movie a good score in my opinion, they are great, and I think a lot of people will enjoy them.As others have pointed out, its difficult to follow along what is happening, and even what people are saying, even if you can hear every word. I have only watched this movie once, but i would imagine it would be better on a second viewing.The problem is simply that there is too much information crammed into too short a movie. A 1 minute dialogue can contain so much information, references to earlier/ other parts of the movie, meanings, idioms, etc, that they are honestly hard to comprehend and/ or decipher, and really just go over your head.Some of the character motivations/ expressions are also hard to understand, or just not done very well, in large part due to the hectic nature of the movie. For example, there is a woman with son, and her son is a large motivation to everything she is doing. But it doesnt hit the viewers very well, she is like ""my son is important to me"", and the viewer is like ""yea ok, i guess"". I dont know, i feel like it could have been done better. I also still dont quite understand the antagonists motivations, or how certain relationsship in the movie works.I think Nolan should have read a page out of his own movie making books and taken some inspiration from his own Batman films. Much care is given to Bruce wayne and batman, and how they feel about being batman, the relationship with Rachel etc. I feel like time and breathing room was needed in this movie, because i kept being reminded about his Batman movies, but while also thinking ""this needs more care and emotion, like in the batman movies"".I think a rewritten script for two movies would have been a lot better and solved a lot of the issues.",Tenet
1251,carkol2005,Nolan is Nolan's worst enemy.,5,14 September 2020,"Nolan, my dude, you need a break. Not only from movies, but from life in general. You may need to calm down a little bit.Now, seriously, what is the problem with this guy? Why, in every movie he makes nowadays, there is always this necessity for making super, super serious characters, always looking super, super intense and talking like soulless machines? I guess that, since the Dark Knight (and I like that movie btw) that is his trademark, but the guy is not Tarkovsky, as much as he would love to be. He always thinks he's making super artsy, cerebral, sophisticated movies and, following that train of thought, his characters are always trying to talk ""deep"" stuff, spewing exposition like there is no tomorrow. You know, something Nolan is known for.I still like Interstellar, Inception, the Dark Knight, and even Dunkirk. My favorites of him are Memento, the Dark Knight and Inception. My least favorites are the Dark Knight Rises and this one.So, you thought his movies are over-expositive? Man, this one makes the rest of them look like 2001 A Space Odyssey in comparison. This movie has one of the worst expositition incontinence I've ever seen in a movie. Always talking talking talking talking, and always trying so fricking hard to explain the plot. There is a sequence in which Michael Caine appears to explain the plot to the protagonist, and the only purpose of the sequence and the character is that, explaining the plot. Literally, it's the only appearance of Michael Caine in the movie. And guess what? The movie doesn't even bother to give him an inch of characterization, apart from being English. How insulting is that??You may think, the plot of the movie is really complicated, so that's the reason why the plot needs to be explained by the characters every minute. But no. If you think that, you've just been fooled by Nolan. At the end of the day, the plot is that there is this realy really bad antagonist, Kenneth Brannagh, and these good guys, Washington and Pattinson. Brannagh has cancer, so he just wants to die and (because he's bad and her fiancé doesn't love him I guess??) he wants to take the world with him. So, the future humanity contacts him to provide him with some technology that allows objects to inverse entropy, so in these things time runs backwards. By some convoluted plan that is explained over and over in the movie (and still it's confusing), Brannagh would be able to inverse the entire planet so, by some logic, the world would collapse and everybody would die. The future is OK with that plan since they also want to die because (and this is explained in the last 20 minutes in the movie, I swear to God) the world is literally drowning itself in climate change, so they think ""No need to keep living, we will just kill the past so that we will die too!"". This plan doesn't make any sense in a lot of ways, but the most insulting one is that they don't even know if by killing the past, the future will die, so what's the reason for this desperate suicide? Do you want me to believe that a future Earth that is capable of, basically reverse time, can't do anything about climate change but giving up and waiting for suicide?? The worst thing is, although this is really crucial to the plot, nothing is developed but instead it's explaining by Brannagh in three lines of dialogue at the end of the movie. Instead of giving a stupid explanation that don't make much sense, why the movie doesn't develop that plot point throughout the movie little by little? The reason is, they don't have time for that. They have so much exposition to talk, that unless the movie lasts for 4 hours, it's impossible for Nolan to establish the plot without verbalizing it constantly.The reversion of time. Sorry to say it, but it felt extremely gimmicky. Not only there is that, but there is time travel too. That's weird, because Nolan himself said that this movie is not about time travel. Dude, your movie is about reversion of time and time travel, are you kidding me? There is bearly anything else in your movie!! Look, I'm not saying that you can't make an action movie with time inversion, because you can. In fact, how cool could that be? But, I'm afraid that in this movie, it's really underutilized and pointless throughout the last third of the movie. Basically, in the end, there is this war of the good guys vs the bad guys, and the good guys army splits in two halves, one it is inverted, and the other half isn't. Why do they do that? They clearly establish that an inverted bullet is as dangerous as a normal bullet. Not more, not less. So, is just to confuse the enemy? Idk, it's never shown. There is actually no reason, they just have to use the inversion technology. That is why I say that it felt really gimmicky in a good chunk of the movie.If we dive into the characters, you will see what is really lacking here. Washington and Pattinson really tried to give the characters some level of personality, being Pattinson the one who really give one nice impersonation of a secondary character. Washington, on the other side, tries but his script gets on the middle of him. When he is fighting is fine, but when he's not you will see that something is missing. No personality can be shown if your only chance to shine is through reacting to expository dialogue... Being fair, Washington's character could have been developed through his relationship with Brannagh's wife, but that went almost nowhere too. And speaking of that woman... Well, she is the biggest victim of Nolan. Fully, completely. Her acting is really stiff (as Brannagh's), but pretty sure it's not her fault- it's Nolan's fault. Look at her acting and you will see I'm right. She acts serious, very serious, almost comically serious, and taking account of the directing of actors in Nolan's movies, I'm sure that those were Nolan's instructions. And her character is, like every woman in Nolan's movies (except maybe Anne Hathaway in the Dark Knight Rises), very bland. Look, I get it ok? A son is something important. But if you are a woman this doesn't mean that all your emotions are connected with your son, ok? That's a very insulting way of portraying women. She, throughout the movie, keeps saying ""My son. My son. My son. I'm nothing without my son"". Besides, she is only that. She is the object to be rescued and that's it. In fact, this movie reminded me of James Bond not a few times, with the difference that James Bond has wit, charm and some development.And folks, we are forgetting one thing. The Nolan twist and the end of the movie. Because you know, the guy needs them like air to breathe. This is, though, the least compelling of all Nolan twists. Basically Washington comes from the future and he knows Pattinson since many years ago, because he created and ran Tenet and he recruited Pattinson, being the Washington that we see in the movie the one that hasn't travelled yet, so he's oblivious of all that (since in his timeline, that hasn't happened yet). But this is completely unrelated to the plot, unnecesary and pointless, and opens a lot of contrived questions that didn't need to be asked nor answered. It looks like a twist by contract. Whatever, another Nolanism.By the way, the score of this movie sounds like someone trying to copy Inception's BSO. It's like Hans Zimmer without Zimmer being in it.Now it's time to talk about positives. It's sad, but even though I'm not the biggest fan of Nolan's style of directing and scripting, I usually like his movies. But in this movie even the acting felt uninspired, and that never happened in a Nolan movie before. If I had to point for positives, I guess the action scenes were creative, and the plot is, or could have been, really interesting. It is like a higher, sophisticated version of a James Bond movie with certain elements of sci-fi. More than that, I walked out very underwhelmed, even when I was ready to accept all the traits of a Nolan movie. 4.5/10",Tenet
1252,redlightlessness,A user manual should be given along with the tickets,7,2 December 2020,I believe not many (perhaps nobody) can understand this movie at the first watch. So a ticket should also be eligible for multiple watches or somebody could easily sue them for taking their money and confusing them instead of entertaining.I rate it 7 since i very much liked the idea of two entities co existing while living on inverted timelines. To make them fight on the same scene was a genious effort. I had to think for a day to digest the fight scene.,Tenet
1253,giallopudding,Pummeled by A Paradox,5,8 September 2020,"Well, it finally arrived, and Tenet was...a spectacle, of sorts. That can never be taken away from the king of practical effects and 70mm IMAX thunder vision. Plot-wise, don't even try to wrap your head around the time traveling paradox. Not worth the effort. And forget about finding any character development, because clearly director Nolan had no interest in making a film for adults.He cast a no-name with shall we say limited range in the lead - John David Washington - a nice looking, athletic actor, but lacking stature, posture and gravitas of any kind. Nolan's gangly, morose blond Brit, Elizabeth Debicki - half a foot taller than our hero - is a femme fatale of sorts, but with a heart. She isn't out of the Bond girl mold, that's for sure. Perhaps the times we live in dictated more representation from the towering volleyball-playing crowd.The antagonist Andrei Sator is played by the veteran actor/director Kenneth Branagh. He could have phoned in his performance, and while it is not objectionable, it also is not noteworthy. It is sufficient. I'm not sure anybody could have done his part any better, considering the material; plenty could have done it worse, though.The action is well paced and virtually non-stop. Missing is any sense of levity or humor or human emotions that would have served to flesh out the characters and make us care for them. This movie is deadly earnest. Only Robert Pattinson's Neil, who assist our protagonist in saving the world, draws our empathy and a twinge of concern. He's the only person in Tenet who seems to be enjoying himself in the least - the indomitable optimist even when facing overwhelming opposition and slim chances. His acting chops are bonafide, and I look forward to seeing him in anything he does in the future.Tenet is about as entertaining as you'd expect a film to be, if the director decided to extrapolate one interesting idea (that characters and objects can go forward and backward in time simultaneously) into 150 minutes of visual and audio pummeling by paradox. Your psyche may be bruised from sitting through this film in its entirety.Nolan is a writer/director to be admired for the chances he takes, and his dedication to realism in resisting the CGI revolution. Tenet gets 5 stars for the amazing visual effects, but it could have been so, so much more.",Tenet

I did read in another review you have to watch the movie a few times within a short time to understand and that the script isn't always loud and clear to follow. Which that is true. So yeah. No one has to watch this Nolan brothers movie unless you got enough of mind to follow this from only one watch.,Tenet
1255,glennmeerten06,"Nolan strikes gold, but has a kink in his armor",8,2 September 2021,"Tenet is everything a cinéphile should applaud and adore: an original, complex and mindbending blockbuster made for the big screen. More of this please, Hollywood.Nolan's obsession with time provides us with an amazing visual experience that combines stellar sci-fi concepts with iconic action imagery. Tenet answers the question you never knew you wanted to ask in the first place: what if Inception was a James Bond film?Given the scenarios Nolan puts on the screen, it's staggering to witness just how much of the film is captured in camera. Not just the infamous 747 scene deserves accolades but it is the most impressive one.Once again though, Nolan's biggest weakness weighs on this film as it has with most of his previous endeavors: exposition. The film has to explain a lot of its concepts and rules to the audience. Unfortunately, Nolan yet again couldn't find a more interesting and visual route to guide the audience there. Conversations at a table, in chairs or through phone calls... It's all present in Tenet, complete with Michael Caine's gorgeous British voice in an attempt to make it a fraction more tolerable for the viewer. Caine might as well be the same character in all of Nolan's pictures.Even though the kink in Nolan's armor is more noticeable than ever, it doesn't take away from my overall appreciation of Tenet as a whole. It demands a full-time focus from its audience, but rewards those who provide it with a mind-boggling experience.",Tenet

The special effects and real-time location shots are some of the best of Nolan's career, James Bond-like and brilliantly photographed in a time sequence format by his cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, who worked as DP on 2 other Christopher Nolan films, ""Dunkirk"" and ""Interstellar."" These are reasons the film should be seen in the cinema, on the big screen, to be truly appreciated. Took 2 stars off (8 out-of 10) because, while I understood the concept of TENET, Saving the World and International Espionage, the plot is the most challenging to follow of all Nolan's movies. The film moves so quickly, so much going on, that plot points were missed in this first screening of the movie. In true Nolan fashion, as with some of his other films, TENET will require multiple viewings to discover what was missed and to fully comprehend the story. Fine performances from John David Washington as Protagonist, Robert Pattinson as his past-present-future partner Neil, Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branagh who makes a great villain, and a cameo appearance from Nolan muse Michael Caine.",Tenet

Peppered with cliched dialogue and hollow, unbelievable characters and delivered through some seriously bland, lackluster acting.
Washington is completely out if his depth, he didn't fit the role at all, he simply lacks the commanding on screen presence that this sort of role requires - I could picture his father doing a much better job. Even the great thespian Branagh couldn't rescue this abomination from the doldrums, who seemed equally out of place with his awkward lines and terrible accent.
This sad offering completely lacks any rhythm or momentum, I wasn't drawn in at all at any point, instead I found my self impatiently anticipating the end, it just droned on and on. As the cherry on top, the persistently annoying, hopelessly inapt musical score desperately attempts (but miserably fails) to create atmosphere throughout, only succeeding in rendering much of the dialogue inaudible.",Tenet

But in my opinion, Nolan's movies are not there to satisfy anyone; they are there for those who will spend their time to understand and feel the movie, ane appreciate the art! Inception is not meant to be satisfying; it is a masterpiece that must be lived with. Here is the same.Interestingly, after watching Dark, I didn't face much difficulty understanding the movie. Surprisingly, both have a lot in common! Time loops and people who try to save someone and prevent events from happening, yet being the reason that event happend in the first place...So I suggest everyone to train their mind and get ready for these types of complexities before trying to understand them, and must spend enough time to get everything together.I personally enjoyed every part of it.

You can also put a guard to sleep within a second using a magic piece of cloth held loosely under the nose (very convenient!). I'll pass on the super-hero fighting skills of the main protagonist, or his unnecessary and constant attitude towards anyone, because it is not as irritating as the situations and character stories (the blond art aficionado wife divorce issue is a good exemple) thrown at us during the entire movie. Actually, I shouldn't say entire movie, because we got so bored we left before the end.There's a new style of movie in town, a little bit like the more recent James Bonds. It is made out of over-complicated scenarios based on bad, cheap ""witty"" interactions and dialogues, intertwined with extended, pompous action sequences that are incoherent and quite boring.One very strange fact to notice; the airplane preparation sequence soundtrack and scene construction, around 30 mins in, resembles the Kane plane heist scene in Batman 3 a little too much for comfort.Lastly, I have to talk about the sound.

Neither did how the world was going to blow up by a single bomb.Did we really need the regular briefings of fictional technical explanations, followed up by useless analogies, to attempt to explain what's to happen? They never did. Instead the scenes seemed to regularly evolve into something entirely different.At 2 and a half hours I got bored even when the action was pumping. As an example, watching a 2 minute fight scene in reverse, that we already saw forward, left me yawning.

1279,thierryserra-05310,Dumb nonsense. Worst movie of the year!,2,7 October 2020,"So I went to see Tenet... wish I hadn't. More than 2 hours wasted of my life.
If you insist on watching the movie, just make sure you disconnect your brain before entering.Story makes no sense, it's filled with paradoxes and contradictions and characters are shallow and unrelatable. If they live or die, you couldn't care less. At no point do you have any sympathy for these people.I must say the action scenes are impressive and forward-backward combat is intense and interesting. Makes no sense, but it's fun to watch. Everything else is disposable.
Below you will understand why this movie is among my bottom 5 movies of the year. Spolier alert.When you are making a time-traveling story, the time line and space-time interactions have to be deeply thought through to make sure you don't find yourself in endless loops or paradoxes. Tenet didn't think anything through. It's filled with mistakes. Some quite obvious, some deeply buried in a nonsense story.
First, we have a group of ""heroes"" from an unknown and un-explained government branch, that know about time travel and are here to prevent the destruction of the universe. I kid you not. Fine, I can go along with that. A kind of cheap and simple way to explain what the characters are fighting for.Then, there's the villain. Super millionaire, with endless resources, hellbent on destroying the universe. Cliché anyone? yet another example of a movie without a lot of thought put into it. Now, this evil mastermind knows that if he succeeds, the whole universe will cease to exist. Why? Is he angry with society? Is he disappointed on humanity? There is no reason for him trying to end all existence.
The story tells you 9 pieces of the doomsday machine had to be gathered to operate, but the movie begins with the bad guy obtaining the last piece. Why are there 9 pieces then? Wouldn't it have been more to fun to see the race between heroes and villains trying to obtain the pieces? Why no just say it is one machine and keep it simple?
And time travelling: heroes can travel into the future and move backwards in time or travel to the past and move forward. But when he is travelling backwards, somethings are moving forward while others ar moving backwards. Not only is it confusing, but it makes no sense. Isn't everything except the hero supposed to move backwards? If a car chase ends in an explosion where he gets blown to pieces, shouldn't he begin as pieces getting pulled back together? Instead he freezes?!
But how are they able to travel in time? Another fantastic solution: someone (no one knows who) in the future made a time traveling machine and, somehow, in the present, they found those machines. Really? That's how you pulled time-machines out of your sleeve?
Ant they tell you there's only a few machines, yet the heroes find them all over the place. Very conveniently. And it's an unknown, futuristic, new technology, yet a group of soldiers are now experts on the subject. How?They tell you that you cannot touch your future or past self or you will disintegrate into oblivion. Yet the hero has a fabulous fight scene... with himself!!! And they never touched? Not even a little bit?They tell you that, no matter what you do, what happened will happen; you can't change the past. So what's the point of the movie? Why are the heroes fighting. If there is a future where someone will build a time machine, clearly the bad guy didn't succeed in his evil plans. Why worry? It's already happened.The final scene is ""great"" (<- notice my irony). That's when you realize budget wasn't sufficient: The story takes you to a deserted factory in the middle of the desert, where the bad guys are trying to detonate the machine. Again, conveniently enough, there is a time machine right there. In the middle of nowhere. So they decide they will have two teams of super soldiers (that is unclear where they came from). One will fight forward while the other will travel to the future and fight backwards. Why? What's the point?
The moment where future and past will meet is exactly the moment of detonation. That would mean that both teams are too late. Right?
But the best part is that these two teams find themselves in this battlefield, filled with gunfire and explosions fighting against... no one. Budget cuts? Was there not enough extras to hire and enemy force? Heroes charge amidst explosions and bullets but you never see the enemies. Not one. What are they shooting at? it's completely abandoned. There isn't a single enemy soldier. What kind o battle is this?In the end, they travel back in timer to the moment where the supervillain is on his boat and will activate the doomsday machine. Although, since they traveled into the past, the machine has not been assembeled yet. So his trigger travels in time too?
But they want to fool the bad guy by using his wife to tramp him. If this villain is the future villain that has assembled the machine, he knows his wife is a traitor and would shoot her on sight. Again, since in he already shot her in the future. But he is seduced by her, so it must the past villain that doesn't know that the wife is a traitor and, therefore, doesn't know that the machine has been assemebeled in the future, and therefore is no threat because he doesn't have the trigger yet. So either case makes NO SENSE. Which one is it?
And if they can travel back in time, why don't they just travel to the time where the supervillain is a kid and shoot him, and be done with?Like I said, this movie SUCKS and it hasn't been thought through at all. Poorly written, poorly acted, and terribly managed. You can never understand who's doing what in what direction. A total disaster.",Tenet

It had a lot for a four course meal of so many proven film components but constructed in a unique way. I'm not certain how many viewings it would take to piece every scene together - the editors must still be having flashbacks. To be completed. Or started later. Branagh was terrifying. Didn't connect other actors to their other major roles. Superb cast. I did watch key scenes the second night after watching quite a few explanatory YouTube videos and it helped with some of the plot elements. Some people have perhaps questioned my comments and a rating of 8 - how good can it be if I don't understand it. Well, I think I understand enough to enjoy the ride.

I was fully expecting most of them to be gushing ""Nolanites"" brownnosing the director. Was surprised to see even the fanboys were disappointed with this mess.Like the other reviews have said, this movie is much too dense and difficult to follow. It is so layered as to be pretentious. I felt like I sat down to watch it halfway through - for the entire movie.One would argue it's so deep as to need multiple viewings. For me, it's so deep as to be suffocating. Within the first ten minutes, I was asking myself what the heck was going on and never really got an answer to my questions. I understood they needed to stop the Russian meanie and he was using time-based elements to do bad things, but most of the events surrounding it I did not comprehend.The characters weren't interesting at all - vapid, 2-dimensional, taking themselves too seriously. I really didn't care what happened to any of them except for the Russian dude - naturally I wanted him to get his comeuppance for being such a despicable human being.But Nolan could do with a little bit more light-heartedness in his films, as in, humor. Let us breathe for a few minutes - it balances the film out. Take a break from the ""thought-provoking"" stuff and balance it out with a quip or joke now and then. Or at least give the audience some time to think about the complex ideas set forth. Quit firehosing the audience with philosophical/expositionary layer cake, please.There is thought-provoking and then there is thought-is-choking.

Reversed entropy just doesn't fly at all. Interstellar makes sense (for the most part at least), Tenet doesn't make any sort of sense at all.People who read subtitles are going to miss out, no matter how many times they watch it.I think this is one of Nolan's worst movies. It's new, but not really a in a good way.",Tenet

1286,amanmsp,A visually and conceptually outstanding mind-bender,9,14 December 2020,"With Tenet, Nolan once again showcases his unparalleled imagination and his skills with tackling out of this world concepts and visuals. Tenet is a blend of classic spy thriller elements with some of the most original and mind-bending concepts ever put to film. From a visual and conceptual standpoint, Tenet is one of Nolan's biggest achievements, as it contains some of the most impressive sequences he has ever put to screen, particularly the airport fight sequence and the final battle sequence, which are among the most memorable moments in the film. Despite the presence of quite a few exposition-heavy sequences, which are inevitable considering the complicated plot and concept, the film still manages to stay thrilling and engaging throughout without any dull moments. Robert Pattinson follows up his outstanding performance in The Lighthouse, with another incredible performance as he manages to become the stand-out actor in the film. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema was another noteworthy aspect as he captures some of the most jaw-dropping visuals ever. When it comes to the score, Ludwig Göransson had big shoes to fill and he absolutely delivered.The mysterious and underdeveloped nature of The Protagonist played by John David Washington, is without a doubt an intentional choice on Nolan's part, as it is evident from the fact that the character is literally called just ""The Protagonist"". However, this decision made the character come across as a bit bland especially compared to the thoroughly fleshed out protagonists from Nolan's previous movies. However, since the movie is totally plot/concept-driven, this iszue doesn't affect the movie much. Kenneth Branagh's villain could've used a bit more development, since his motivations are a very integral part of the plot. Another aspect that could've been improved was the relationship between Washington's and Pattinson's characters as this ultimately turns out to be the heart of the movie.Despite a few minor issues regarding character development, Tenet still proved to be an incredible mind- bending experience and one of Nolan's best works.",Tenet

That illustration will either excite you or overwhelm you.If you like Christopher Nolan I'm sure you will like this one. If you're looking for something ""brand new"" out of him you probably won't find it here. His films have a specific style and this one is on brand. It works for me but it might not for everyone.I will say, I appreciate his longing to continue to use practical effects as well as wanting to think outside the box in what is possible for on screen storytelling.

With this film he put a very hard concept like inversion time in a way that nobody else could ever have imagined. That's fair enough that a film can make you feel very confused and let you with many questions in the mind at a first watch. I think these are also the cutest things about some kind of films. They are the arrow that hit you and forces you to be more curious about the film and the moments that maybe you probably neglected or not taken into consideration. ""Don't try to understand it, feel it"", that was the line told by Clémence Poesy in the film, which is also in a way the message Nolan wanted to give us as a reminder that this would not have been a pastime to be easily understood. I'm personally glad I watched it at the theatre and re-watched it to feel again the power, the suspense and the adrenaline that were put on me as I payed a very detailed attention to all the scenes.The music, even if it was loud, was very beautiful enjoyable and very powerful (especially in the action sequences), and I bless Ludwig Göransson for having made it to the best of his abilities. Also Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography was very particular, especially for those good contrasts between warm and cool colours and of course between the main colours present in this movie (even if for a few minutes: red and blue). My final thought about this film is that Nolan will always stupefy with his crazy and innovative ideas, maybe even if he could not fully satisfy someone. What I love of him is that he always wants to tell something different, which changes the way we watch films. The courage to know how to dare. Good movie, which is still far away from being a masterpiece, but anyway acceptable and intriguing for those who, like me, love to play with mind travels and trying to compose all the pieces of the puzzle, also imagining what could happen after a story ended.",Tenet
1292,mohamed_tarek,Great Movie and Even Greater after seeing it twice :),10,30 August 2020,"I saw tenet on Thursday then on Sunday, once in IMAX and the other one not but it was still bigger than the regular ones. This movie is brilliant. I believe Nolan makes his movies hard so we can see it and enjoyed twice. The Plot, the cast, the soundtrack and the directing was a stuff of Legends. I loved that movie and believe the second time is much better and enjoyable than the first one. The first one you will be distracted whether from the Pace of the movie or eating or drinking or side talking which I don't recommend doing. In the second time I noticed things and understood the movie much more and when I did, I enjoyed it even more. DJW was brilliant as the Protagonist and we are blessed to have DW Son as he will be talented as the old man. Robert Pattinson for me stole the show in every scene. I was against and furious when he was casted as Batman but after this movie, I am impressed and can't wait to see him as Batman ""specially after we saw the trailer"". Nolan for me is my favorite director of all time and I love the fact he wants us to keep thinking and guessing but more than that he wants us to enjoy. In the movie there was a line which I think was addressed to the audience ""Try not to understand it, try to feel it"". He wants us to feel and enjoy the movie. I wanna take that platform to say that I was deeply hurt/upset more than I thought I would about Chadwick's death our King T'challa and I just wanted to say so.

Christopher Nolan goes full Shane Carruth.,7,12 September 2020,"I found the concept intriguing and special effects were exceptional, I'm sure much work was put into it.

I feel for Chris because I'm not smart enough for his vision.I understood the main plot maybe nearing the end, so before that I was mostly confused, so, I get it, but... and it is a big but, a big big but. I did not get invested in the characters, I felt very little for them, and the climax of the last 30 minutes was a torture, because frankly, it was boring, not interesting, whatever you call it, I call it boring.Now the consensus is that we have to see it more than once. Which means renting is a better option, also you will benefit greatly from a pause button. So it makes sense to see it once in the theatre for the eye candy then forget about it till the bluray will come out, yep!

Jordan.. even his dad Denzel would've really made this movie pop.I couldn't get that out of my head the entire movie: ""I'd have loved to see Foxx read that line"", ""did this guy only get the gig because of his dad"", ""that scene would've been so much better if it were another actor"".Too late now, still worth the watch.",Tenet

All you need is to lose focus for 10 seconds and you will yourself scrambling to catch up. It's like 2hrs of constant puzzle solving. Thoroughly enjoyed it and I have to watch it two more times to truly get it in all it's beautify of film making. Extraordinary performances by John David Washington and Robert Pattison. The star power of the two is extreme subtle and they allow the story line to take centre stage. You are so focussed trying to figure out what time you are in you don't have time to enjoy synergy of the two characters but you notice it with time. Now back to this totally new time travelling concept. You can't go back to a specific time, rather you live it in reverse and then the mind boggling moments when you are like: ""omg! That's what was happening"" . Oh you will learn what entropy measurement is a way of distinguishing the past from the future and so many cool concepts. A must watch!",Tenet

My only problem is Washington is a little bit too small to be as tough as he is. Apart from that it's just amazing. Work of art. Then there's the score. This is a movie. Just go and see it.

How the story is constructed is absolutely stunning and its execution is incredibly, skilfully done. The effects are at a level these days that make films such as this possible which is a boon when filmmakers such as Nolan come up with storylines like this. However, all this aside, the concept of the movie and the story itself is brilliant. It is a veritable palindrome. I wish I had the mind to be able to create a story like this. The action is good and casting pretty near perfect. I was unsure about Robert Pattinson at first but after watching it again, he's actually okay and has a certain softness towards the protagonist which I didn't quite grasp at first. All in all, if you're a Nolan fan this is one for you; if you like a good story this is for you.

I say it's unfollowable not because the main story here is hard to understand, it was actually quite easy (and even a bit predictable for the most part for me) when you can actually hear and follow the dialogue.Sometimes I feel like a scene was cut that sets up a character's dialogue but we still get the conversation that doesn't seem to matter, yet it seems to matter. Like when two characters are talking about a painting and how it's a fake and her husband knows it's a fake and is using it to hold over her. For what? What is he holding it over her for? This is never explained especially considering he's already using their son to keep her in line.I've seen people suggest that you need to see this movie twice and one person suggest subtitles to truly enjoy it.

1303,neildanderson,Impenetrable and way too long.,4,1 December 2020,"This seems like a film based on a filming technique. The plot revolves around a device that allows people and things to travel backwards in time, passed on from the future. It touches on the paradox this gives, but provides no explanation.
A billionaire has the a weapon from the future that will destroy all life on earth and decides to use it because he's dying. There's no explanation of why he'd do this. It relies on the idea of the evil genius who just wants to destroy for no reason. He has an army of people working for him, with no explanation of why they would given that he's going to kill them all.
While an unreliable plot can actually add to a film, such as Momento, or fantastic effects can add to an impenetrable plot, such as Inception, or can be ignored for a fun plot, like Terminator, this does not achieve any of these.

1307,mikekisil,"Good director, rubbish writer - Christopher Nolan, the complete package.",2,20 September 2020,"Two and a half hours that I will never recover. It is good to know that Nolan keeps the Stuntman Guild going, as his action scenes show a man to whom CGI is a last resort rather than a first. But what does it all mean ????
Before he joins the pantheon of legendary action film directors of Ford and Hawks and their modern-day heir-apparents - McTiernan, Hill, Mendes, McQuarrie, Miller and Wheatley - he is going to have to give up his function as a writer to someone who can write a comprehensible story with succinct dialogue and also hire a sound engineer to whom the word ""clarity"" actually has meaning.
Whatever you do, don't give this film a second viewing in the hope of gaining a better understanding of it. It will just inflate the box office figures and give Nolan a reputation as a ""big"" filmmaker that he simply does not deserve. The biggest conundrum about him is that Hollywood still throws big money at him to make films.
After the first half hour I gave up trying to make sense of the plot - a better example of ""gobbledygook"" in modern cinema I've yet to find. Tell a lie, ""Inception"" runs it a close second. There are spies, a threat of global destruction, a damsel in distress, that tired cliché of a Russian oligarch villain, some action sequences where you can see the join between ""heart-stopping"" location shooting and ""green screen"" safety and a finale where something needs to be switched off before the clock reaches ""0:00"" and lots of body-armoured extras shooting at one another, where you can't tell the good guys from the bad.
And it's loud !!! Not something down to the cinema's sound system as I was assured by my local's management. There is a genuine thrilling sequence in the middle of the film that involves BIG trucks that is on a par with the stunt work in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" but your mind has been thoroughly boggled by that time and afterwards the wait for the end is interminable.

It felt like a return to church. Typically, a congregation is there for each other, elevated by the shared experience in transcendent possibility granted us by similar material that ignites the imagination. Of course, every member of this ""congregation"" entered into the said ""shared experience"" during 2020, a year doomed to become an adjective. And let me tell you: This experience was a real 2020.
As the lights lowered, so did my facemask, but only for a sip of my brew or to capitalize on stolen fries (thanks, girlfriend). Others in the theater did the same thing, although they were slightly more liberal than I was with removing material that seemingly protects the air we breathe. The Flix Brewhouse Pre-Show consisted of scenes from past Christopher Nolan flicks such as ""Inception"" and ""Memento,"" two films that define his canon (like ""Dunkirk,"" time itself is used to serve the story). Also, we were enlightened, via video-special, about the painstaking protocol that the movie-theater staff have had to endure since Covid-19 became the Covid-20 that we know today. Did I feel safe? Well, I didn't come to the theater to see a horror movie, even though fear is generally absent even if I were. Safety first, I get it. That's how I ""sell,"" too.
The movie begins with a bang, literally. The sounds of guns in a theater (in only one case were they unwelcomed in a Nolan film, and that was in 2012 during a showing of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which makes this first scene a little extra-intense because men enter an actual theater with machine guns) are extra-loud as if the audience is taken to a shooting range on a Michael Mann set (the same director Nolan imitated for the first scene of ""The Dark Knight""). I'm once again transported into that transcendent possibility. The music is amazing. The action is intense. The scene demands attention. Keep in mind, this is my first film-going experience in over half a year, and hadn't realized how much I've been longing for just a LOUD experience, but I am no stranger to watching films that are new to me. So the ""transcendent possibility,"" to me, remains a possibility, I'm afraid...
...Only...a possibility.
The shark is in your face in scene two. A Spielbergian discount trick, a new filmmaker won't have the money to show the shark throughout the whole film, so the pop-shot, literally the shark popping its head out of the water, is an intense moment. The shark's fin is teased only in scene 1, but as we go to scene 2, everything is explained (and the only interesting thing about the scene is the idea itself, which would have been just as well explained by, you know, watching the actual movie). Well, an explanation is given, anyway. Nothing is really ""explained.""
Here's the rundown, though...There is new technology. New to us (in the present), yet probably better understood in the future (when it is invented). This technology enables us to know the future by reliving the past. Doing so, re-experiencing the past, requires us to mirror the events as we (in the present) are inverted (into the past), literally moving backwards. To explain visually, you are driving a car whilst ""inverted"" (meaning: re-experiencing a past event), you will appear driving a vehicle backwards to those experiencing time going forward. Confusing? Not sure the science is clear, here. This is no ""Interstellar.""
The entire show, I felt ready to punch myself for the sake of the film not knocking any sense into me. Cue: The Jerry Seinfeld stand-up bit where he's in a darkened theater, whispering endless questions throughout a movie (because he's confused) ""Who's that guy? What does he want? Why is she with him? Why is he like that? Why does she stay with him if he's like that? Why did they ever have a kid together? Why did she kill him?""
""Ohhhhhh...well, it's good that she killed him, then.""
Sitting in my seat, I literally became the meme: ""MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!""
But that's been me this entire year, this 2020 that we've gotten ourselves into.
""Tenet,"" a palindromic title being more suggestive than meaningful (at least to the confused audience member that I was), seems meant NOT for us in the present. This film is NOT meant to be viewed only once. This film is made for our future selves (if you're asking me). To watch the film almost requires a class to understand, although the story is pretty simple:
A woman stays with her abusive husband for the sake of being with her child. Yet, the child, a major character (in a twist that still doesn't make sense to me), is essentially a MacGuffin (an object used for the story, but used only for character motivation, not a part of the real story).
What does this have to do with time travel?
What does Time Travel have to do with the story?
Well, it's necessary to save the world. WHAT?
Oh yeah, the villain (the husband) wants to blow up the world.
So we need all these unnamed characters, essentially uninteresting versions of James Bond (there is...NO room for character development here).
What I really feel, having only seen it as my present self (although with reflection time as my future self, presently)...is this film falls victim to a filmmaker's number one fear: Being pretentious. What I believe is that, with ""Memento"" and all the cinematic tricks that make it great (each progressive scene takes place prior to the previous one chronologically)...and ""Inception,"" another high-concept film that also borders on pretentious filmmaking...""Tenet"" seems merely the next logical step. It's as if Christopher Nolan asked himself ""How have I yet to play with time?""
I'd even go so far as to say that Nolan is aware of his pretentiousness. Enter the token Michael Caine character, there for our protagonist (literally only called ""The Protagonist"" in this movie) to mistreat a server by trying to act like a rich snob only to be called out because he doesn't look rich enough. This was the film's one of maybe two attempts at humor. No time for that.
The trick itself has been done in countless movies. A scene is filmed and played backwards in the film. Usually this trick is done to mask the fact that the scene couldn't otherwise be pulled off. Usually, this trick is done without the audience realizing it. Here, though, in ""Tenet,"" the audience is supposed to marvel at the filmmaking with plenty of ""Ooohs"" and ""Ahhhhs,"" and Nolan doesn't have to worry about the audience asking ""Would this movie work if it wasn't filmed this way?""
That's what happens with ""Memento."" That's what happens with ""Dunkirk,"" too (although, I'd argue that a complimentary film to ""Dunkirk,"" ""1917,"" could NOT have worked any other way than how the director made it). Every other Christopher Nolan film works gloriously (and it'd be worth it to watch them re-edited into chronological order). Here, ""Tenet"" could not be filmed another way because the filmmaking is the story (the ""reverse-film-effect"" IS central to the plot). And Nolan gets himself into trouble here. See, the movie is many movies. We have a dysfunctional family plot. We have a heist movie. We have a war film again, too (more reminiscent of ""Full Metal Jacket,"" as Nolan is a Kubrick-lover, but this is NO Kubrick film). And we have a futuristic time-travel movie (without feeling like a science-fiction film almost at all). And we have the reverse-film-effect concept in itself (when you blow up in an exploding car, you freeze with hypothermia), which is the ""new technology"" that the film wastes no time having to explain, although it does so in the only way possible, through analogy. Through idea. Through concept. Through show and tell. Well, tell and show. And the audience must buy this rather than think about it.
It feels like Nolan thought about it, but this is why I really must label this movie pretentious. Don't take my word for it, though. The movie made me feel stupid, which is a natural side-effect of a pretentious film. Maybe you'll be in for the car chases and the explosions without questioning the rest of it. But for a movie that provides so many answers, one wonders the questions that are being asked.
Or is it the other way around?",Tenet
1311,Chronic_Cuntlyf,"Another example of Nolan being style over substance, but I still enjoyed it.",6,27 December 2020,"Just like Inception, and even Memento (though Memento handles it better), Tenet has a fairly simple and generic plot, held up higher than it otherwise would have been by an interesting concept and brilliant visual storytelling. The sequences that involve time inversion are incredible to watch, and it genuinely left me wondering how they achieved it behind the scenes.I'm glad I waited for a home-media release so that I could watch this with subtitles. Nolan's growing notoriety for terrible sound mixing is not exaggerated. That said, the soundtrack is pretty decent, and despite not being composed by Hans Zimmer, it does sound fairly reminiscent of other work Zimmer has done for Nolan's films in the past. You barely notice it wasn't him.I'd rather re-watch this movie than Inception, but I would say that Inception is a slightly better film, mainly due to its characters and their backgrounds. Tenet is just less of a snooze-fest to sit through, despite suffering from similar exposition scenes that will grow more and more irritating on future viewings.It's well-paced, competently written and acted (no real stand out performances, but no bad ones either), but the main reason to watch this movie would be its cinematography and editing.It's a shame that this pandemic has resulted in this movie bombing in cinemas, because aside from the fact that subtitles are almost necessary to sit through this film, it would have been a very impressive spectacle on the big screen.6/10.",Tenet

1313,darryl_hj,Awful sound editing and play holes,5,12 December 2020,The movie seems to rely on baselines to mask the giant plot holes.Most of the dialogue is either mumbled or drowned out by excessively loud music and what little you do hear is bland and mundane.More evil Russians voiced badly by non-natives just adds to the overall crap of this movie.Its not smart or cool it's just annoying.,Tenet
1314,marcadams-21925,Another Masterpiece,10,26 August 2020,"As the title reads, another masterpiece by the master himself. Every film I've watched by Nolan has always left me feeling ecstatic. This one left me leaving the cinema a little confused but in a good & curious way. Watching TENET for me was like I've seen the a mathematical equation and the result of a equation, but I just needed to understand the formula. I've always prefered watching films that leave me wanting to 'understand them properly'...the soundtrack is on point as usual, the quality and feel of the film is fantastic and the stylish appearance of all the scenes, costumes etc. The script flows, everyone is cast well, nothing feels akward or cringey. Truly a master of his art Christopher Nolan is, have been awaiting this film and it didn't disappoint.",Tenet
1315,Manolo2001,Not given lightly,10,9 July 2021,"I think this movie may not eventually come to be a sci fi classic, as I get it does not appeal to everyones taste, not that any movie actually does, but I think this is a love or hate deal.I'll try not to get into plot details, as they are hard enough to understand watching the movie. So as a general comment the movie is really well made, the plot is entertaining, involving, challenging and very unique.Just trying to follow what is going on, what is present, past or what is reversed and what is not, and how everything fits together is an awesome challenge. I love this about the movie, I personally find the plot extremely eterntaining as you actually have to think and use your brain in order to understand it.I have never seen a time travel movie like this, it is truly unique. A masterpiece, maybe, for some. I personally lvoed it.It is not a trivial movie to understand. But it is engaging, entertaining and challenging.",Tenet
1316,TurboTerminator,Not the best Chris Nolan movie,6,23 May 2021,Before I write the review... I have to mention that I am a big fan of Chris Nolan and think that he comes up with exceptional movies....but this movie is not one of his best efforts. The six stars are for coming up with the concept of the movie.The movie is almost impossible to follow during first watching. You get the concept and theme but don't understand what exactly is going on. Also I thought the dialogues are hard to follow because of so many things are going on at the same time and it was loud and noisy at times.The lead actor John David Washington gave a wooden performance and probably not the best choice for the role. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki give better performances. Overall the movie leaves you dissatisfied and confused.,Tenet
1317,trevholmz,Not a film for people with small IQ's,10,25 September 2020,An outstanding film that really does make you think. Any negative reviews will just be from people who can't keep up. CN has pushed the boundaries even further from Inception & Interstellar.,Tenet
1318,omeralaa,An absolute masterpiece!,9,29 August 2020,"At first, I want to ask Christopher Nolan one question, HOW THE HELL YOU DID THIS?
Seriously I want to have an answer, How did he write such as this masterpiece!
How did he get this complicated, fabulous and creative idea? What is going on in his mind?
The story is written and directed perfectly, the narration style was absolutely unique.
I have no idea how can anyone direct such as this story, that was a huge challenge, and as usual Nolan gave us a masterpiece that we'll put beside (Memento), (Inception) and (Interstellar)
The movie is so fast-paced in a good way, there was no boring moment.
The chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson was great and funny and both of their performance was really good.
Elizabeth Debicki performance was the best in the movie because she had the chance to show her acting abilities and she cached up that chance and showed us an A level acting.The music wasn't unique and distinct as the music of Interstellar for example and I think this movie needed the touch of Hans Zimmer, I'm not saying that Ludwig Göransson failed but Hans Zimmer in another level.If there was something I'd say that I didn't like it in the movie would it be that Nolan discarded any set up or characters backgrounds except Elizabeth Debicki dramatic story but it wasn't that bad for me, I didn't care about that, the exciting story didn't give me the chance to focus on it.
But the actual problem was the third act, it was really complicated and I got lost and I convinced myself to discard the questions that were in my head and enjoy the well-made action sequences and Elizabeth Debicki performance.I think this kind of movie that gets better with a second and third watch.",Tenet
1319,justincrunden,The Greatest Film of Our Time,10,15 December 2020,"Where to begin?Tenet will be regarded as the greatest film of our time in the future by the civilizations of the universe.The concepts Nolan incorporates into this two and a half visual feast is astounding.The mastery of the fourth dimension.Seeing the final outcome and knowing what to do in order for it to happen. Not quite fate in the traditional understanding but a twist on fate with the intentions of the protagonists being the deciding factor that leads to the desired outcome for the benefit of all mankind.The real genius of this film is how Nolan plays with the concept of time that he invents multiple concepts never before imagined.When I was watching the first part of the film my mind was furiously trying to keep up with the complexity of what was occurring before me.And then I realised the true genius of the film. The dialogue. Nolan had managed somehow to write a dialogue whereby the characters were mimicking the Time Tenet of the film. Their dialogues were in reverse but still coherent, amazing right?!The power of our brains to absorb and adapt to this new found dialogue is incredible because I found myself simply accepting the dialogue and letting it wash over me.I've read a lot of reviews that missed this key point. I can understand if they didn't quite get this that it would have the effect of frustrating them, I myself at first thought that there may be something wrong with the sound mixing, but I came back to one single idea that Nolan simply does not make mistakes, this guy is a perfectionist as standard but clearly a genius way way way ahead of his time.The film also is long at two and a half hours but due to the efficiency of each scene, nothing is wasted, nothing is over explained, once an image is transmitted, the message is understood and we cut to the next scene. I feel this method of giving only what is required and nothing more for us to follow the story has also been taken to the next level in this film.I've also read people saying they need to watch the film multiple times to get all the things they missed. I agree that I will definitely watch this film again at some point in the future but the film is made in such a way that it can be easily followed if you understand each new concept as it is thrown at you. If you miss the meaning at any stage then you may fail to follow the remainder of the film.As with all Nolan films there are plenty of red herrings too which makes for the enjoyment but it also makes following the film without getting lost doubly hard.But it is a film, and so again, Nolan has factored in that as a film, it is available for multiple viewings and as such he wasn't afraid to pack it with multiple new concepts and complexities. This man is the most generous film-maker in the history of film.What Nolan has achieved here is nothing short of breathtaking.I also read that the film had no soul but again, probably written by frustrated viewers whose bias slowly turned as the film drew to a close.I found myself shed a little tear at the end and I said out loud as the credits rolled, ""Thank you Christopher"".",Tenet
1320,armanlikhon,Nice one,10,28 November 2020,Starts with complex idea....which is hard to follow.after first half of the film you can finally grasp whats happening. This masterpiece deserves a sequel. But we know thats npt gonna happen.,Tenet
1321,Donnie_Quixotic,Nolan reverses entropy of the movie business,10,12 January 2021,"It was definitely difficult to follow on my the first watch-through back in August, but my second viewing was an absolute delight. It's one of those movies I'll be returning to for repeat viewings. I see it becoming another film that'll be appreciated even more by critics and audiences as time goes on (analogous to a kind of reverse-entropic effect... I think...)The sheer audacity of Nolan to put something like this on the screen is a marvel to behold. There's no doubt that it is slightly less accessible and more complex a concept than Inception, Interstellar, or Memento; but once you kind of, sort of grasp the entropic principle and how they're applying it in this film, it's up there with the best high concept films of all time. I'm not saying it's scientifically accurate, but it's an interesting filmic, science fiction take on entropy as a scientific concept.It'll help to briefly google ""the second law of thermodynamics (entropy),"" and a little bit of the ""Many Worlds theory"" in quantum mechanics, and ""The Grandfather Paradox"" which is briefly explained in the movie anyway, but it just helps as a primer.All the performances really suit the tone of the film, however, I really don't think you can fully appreciate them on just a single viewing. The technical aspect is as you would expect from a Nolan film: A+As with almost all Christopher Nolan's films, it gets better with every viewing.",Tenet

1324,Rich-91749,Not Nolan's best,5,18 April 2021,"I usually love Nolan's work but this was not his best.The plot is OK-ish but they don't actually explain the thing that drives the entire movie until the very end. Not in a satisfying revelation kind of way but rather in a 'I needed this information an hour ago to be invested in the story' kind of way.Looking back it mostly makes sense but while watching it real time it can be very confusing, particularly towards the end when they start layering multiple timelines at once. I think that's what Inception did well but this film did not. Inception is a pretty complicated film but in any given scene, it was clear what they were trying to achieve. There's a whole section of this film where they go back to an airport and I still don't know why even though it took 15-20 minutes of screen time!The soundtrack is decent but it's actually too loud and more than a few of actors are guilty of mumbling.

1329,Erick_Till,More of the same in endless 2h30m,6,16 August 2021,"I think Nolan is a brilliant director and although I like his movies, I didn't love Tenet.It's too long, full of unnecessary scenes, with a confusing plot.We've watched this kind of story hundreds of times: the villain is a rich guy, smart, obviously Russian, who wants to destroy the world and there is a secret agent who will save the planet practically alone, without super powers or super weapons.In fact I think this plot is part of almost the entire 007 Saga.Add to that, the plot of ""Terminator"", where the future interferes with what happens in the past, plus some typical scenes of ""Mission Impossible"" and you have Tenet with endless 2h and 30m.Such a cliché, you obviously already know the world will be saved, otherwise there would be no one in the future to try to interfere in the past.The amount of unnecessary scenes only serves to lengthen the film.The scene at the airport, even hurried and flawed, is by far the most original and certainly the best in the film.The takes are good and the locations are interesting, but what happens has been filmed so many times that you can guess what comes next.Not even the chase scene can be original or interesting.Tenet also has long explanations assuming you're not understanding anything, which instead of contributing further confuses you. Inception is much more complex, intricate but more logical and innovative.Actors and characters
There doesn't seem to be any motivation in the characters for what they're doing, not even the villain with the power he has. However, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki's performances are very good. John doesn't bring shine to the character and Kenneth doesn't seem threatening enough.We cannot forget how menacing and dangerous Nolan's Joker was.If you have 2 hours and 30 minutes available with absolutely nothing to do, Tenet is an option to consider.This time, Nolan wasn't motivated enough..",Tenet

As seen in the trailers, it involves the journey in time and parallels, although the movie focuses on a short time frame.It might feel like a lot of exposition in the dialogue, but they are needed for this type of movie. I am still dazed! The story line is interrelated and is weaved through out the start to end of the movie.Maybe I was not paying enough attention or just dense, but, I probably need one or two more times to truly appreciate the ""science"" or ""world"" of Tenet. Hopefully, some commentary out there to explain it all to me like I was a 2 year old before it goes on disc or streaming services.All in all, a recommended action sci-fi movie which requires a lot of attention and understanding and if you don't fully get it, the action and visuals will make do till you watch it again.",Tenet

1336,TorontoFilmFan,Mumbo Jumbo,1,2 March 2021,"TENET (2020)
I wanted to see this movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan. I thought Dunkirk, his 2017 film, was the finest film of that year. But I also knew he directed Inception and Interstellar both of which I disliked. Unfortunately, Tenet is a loud two hours of nonsense and a complete waste of time. Muffled dialogue, an incomprehensible storyline with pseudointellectual pretensions, and a severely miscast lead really handicap this movie in spite of its reported 200 million dollar budget.
In spite of attempts by several reviewers here, notably those who claim the film is worthy of a 10, no one has successfully unpacked the plot or storyline or sci-fi concepts supposedly driving this narrative. I mean for much of the film it's even unclear who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. What I got from the script was mumbo jumbo and blah blah blah with words like ""algorithm"" and ""entropy"" tossed in every which way. Amidst all the hokkum is a lot of gunfire, things blowing up and cars and people running backwards.
Maybe because the antics up on screen defy comprehension, there is likewise no emotional link to anything that happens on screen or to anyone. John David Washington's character and performance is an obvious weakness in the film. Definitely the wrong actor to lead this undertaking, his acting is beyond wooden and left me with nothing to care about, even if his task at hand was to save all of humanity from one evil oligarch. His fellow actors out performed Washington in every scene highlighting his limited acting chops. Robert Pattinson did a great acting job and always managed to hit the right chord. Kevin Branagh is entertaining, and at the risk of being typecast as the evil character's squeeze, Elizabeth Debicki (The Night Manager) delivers the goods. I think there was a love story in here somewhere but even that is hard to get clear from this movie.
Surprisingly for a Nolan film there's nothing really special in the production design, and the visual effects look like nothing more than the film being played backwards. A huge waste of time Tenet is not entertaining, edifying or interesting.",Tenet

There are some good performances, the hero is likeable (he'd make a good first black bond, if he wasn't a Yank) and Michael Caine gets to play a character called Sir Michael, which made me smile.I was the only person there other then one other couple, but the afternoon showings I favour are generally fairly quiet. Hope it does well, as I know cinemas are relying on it too bring people out again.

You just need to pay very close attention to details, conversations and it will definitely reward you.Nolan has made many movies, all of them are something unusual and stunning. The idea he came up with reverse time thing is superb, then executing it is another thing and its done on highest level, writing, editing, sound mixing and minimal use of CGI. Then the acting is definitely not falling off the whole movie itself, 10/10. I'm just loving Johns and Roberts Performances in movies and excited to see Roberts batman as well.There are lots of thoughts put into the Tenet, it is very smart, that's why the movie is little hard to appreciate at first watch, unless you pay very close attention to it whole time. Another thing to admire is visual part, just how well it's done with mixing all reverse and real things together and bonus on that is, it's without CGI, including all explosions and crushes, and music just tops it.I'm not good at writing reviews, but I had to try after seeing Tenet because movie gave me goosebumps many times.

Second there are indeed movies with better plot, but the mix of action, visuals and good plot I have never seen before executed so perfectly. That for me set a new highest bar for an action movie.
People complaining about shallow characters are wrong, they are not shallow at all they are overwhelmed by the events far beyond their control or understanding. In fact they are surprisingly human in the face of the challenges. I hate when the character explores his childhood and first love scars, while he has to defuse a nuclear bomb, like some movies show, THAT is laughable.
The other complain, you have to see the movie twice, well that is an option, but it is your choice, not a directors. I re-winded it in my mind the whole evening finding new delights, your brain is your streamer.

Then you catch on and I thought I understood the overall story at the end, but still had so many questions and didn't understand the point of many scenes. I decided to rewatch it again, and now I was able to understand it and saw the genius in the story.My main complaint with this movie, is I wish they went deeper into the lore. Inception for example, brought the idea of going into ones subconscious, and went deep into that idea. They showed how badly it can go wrong, the possibilities that present itself, the good, etc. For this movie about reversing time, they proposed some time travelling theories, but just left it at theories and didn't delve in. Those who watched it may remember when Robert Pattisons character talked about the ""Grandpa effect"" for example, yet they never attempted it. I would have liked to Christopher Nolan tackling some theories and ""what if's"" in this movie that he's known for doing in Interstellar, Inception, The Dark Knight, etc.That was my only complaint. First time watching it, won't be the best watch. Second or third time, you will have a blast. I do think when viewing Christopher Nolan's past films, he goes in deeper and presents a full scope which this film could have benefited more from. Nonetheless, a great film to not be missed!",Tenet

Tenet sends you on a rollercoaster ride that barely gives in at any point, making you question every scene and characters choice of actions. The complexity of this film for most people will surely demand a second watching, as if you blink you will miss it.
The acting is incredible from all cast members. Like Tarantino, Nolan seems to have a clear idea of which actors will be perfect for any particular film.

But like his most recent film (Dunkirk), this was convoluted and, honestly, boring. The characters and plot are introduced hastily, the dialogue was overly contrived, and scenes feel like they're stitched together incoherently. There was a lack of chemistry between the characters, and I felt like I was watching actors the whole time, not actual characters. There are some redeeming qualities, like the sci-fi element of interacting with the future and its technologies, and the IMAX picture quality. Overall, definitely not as good as his past projects.",Tenet
1355,louis_southwood,Another mind bending sci fi movie From Christopher Nolan with a Spy/Espionage twist,7,31 August 2020,"Tenet was written and directed by Christopher Nolan and tells the story of ""The Protagonist"" a secret agent who has been tasked with trying to prevent world war 3. This is the absolute bare bones synopsis of what this story entails. As just like with Christopher Nolan's previous projects this one has a lot going on.I want to start off by saying Nolan is a filmmaker who I have had a lot of respect for over his career, a filmmaker working within the studio formula but still being able to make wholly original movies. He always manages to bring something new to the table and Tenet is no exception. This movie left quite an impression on me and even almost a week after seeing it, I still notice myself wondering about how this film even exists. Just like with Inception and Memento, Nolan's previous mind bending pieces, Trying to imagine this movie in script form and imaging Nolan having to explain to his cast and crew, it must of been difficult to get the crew entirely on Board with the concept at play here and I have nothing but respect for someone who is not afraid to really think outside the box and Nolan most certainly does just that.From a genre point of view Tenet is Christopher Nolan's take on classic spy thrillers, characters like James bond and Jason Bourne and the worlds they inhabit. with their fast cars, supermodel women, sharp suits and exotic countries. this movie has all of that but rather than relish in all those things, the movie is more interested in exploring unique concepts to tell the story. The way that Tenet handles these unique concepts is nothing short of stunning. There are some set pieces in this movie that will leave you speechless, Nolan use of practical effects and stunts make for some awe-inspiring moments that we don't just get enough of in movies nowadays.Are main stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki all did fantastic jobs with what they are given with Debicki being my favourite performance. They are not particularly developed characters which I have heard some people take issue with. And whilst I do agree maybe a little more backstory for these characters would have helped the film, I did not find myself to bothered by it. Nolan has always been a concept guy over a character guy so it is almost something I come to expect at this point. However, I will admit that some of the dialogue did feel a little clunky and there were some really on the nose lines of dialogue that a felt a little cheesy even for Nolan's standards.One thing I was concerned about going in was the lack of Hans Zimmer. Zimmer and Nolan together are as iconic as bread and butter. Fortunately, I am happy to report that Ludwig Goransson's was great and a highlight of the movie, albeit a little overused. There were several scenes where I felt the music did not really add much and could have been taken out altogether which ironically is something that I have always appreciated about Nolan in past films. On the flip side the music combined with some of the more action-oriented scenes made for some truly pulse raising movie magic. Including the opening sequence which was fantastic.I think that Where this movie suffers the most is its first act. A very choppy, messy and convoluted act that on first viewing did have me a little concerned. The problem is the movie needs to throw a lot of crucial information at its audience for later reveals to have the payoff they deserve and at times it can be a little tiresome. Once you get passed all that and get into the meat of the movie the momentum really picks up and once it does pick up it never really slows back down, but it's just that first hour that really hurts the pacing. There are also some issues with audio mixing I noticed. A lot of dialogue was missed on my first viewing thanks to music or sound effects being too loud. As the film progresses it does seem to improve but it is still can be very distracting at times.
Overall, this is another great addition to the Nolan filmography. It is not his best but certainly not his worst and a pretty great movie to go along with the reopening of cinemas. Oh, and if you can watch this movie in Imax, it is absolutely worth it.

1357,rawena_bll,"It could be really good, but it's not.",6,8 December 2020,"It's a pretty solid concept but the execution leaves you unsatisfied. I liked that it had a different perspective on time travel, fight scenes look good and well made. Robert Pattison, even though I was skeptic about it, did a very good job, you can say that he's determined to not be remembered as that sparkling guy.
I didn't like that the movie had to cling on to so many cliches to make a story and make you care about it. So russian man is ruthless bad guy, the one woman is a slightly updated (but not too much that she can actually handle anything without getting emotional and messing it up, god forbid) maiden in distress, the protagonist is a guy whose only characteristics are being good and american. This is a very good example of how you can mix every single cinema cliche in one single film.The movie is also very fast paced, and every single dialogue counts. If you miss one you won't understand what's happening in the rest of the movie, period. I wish it was a tad slower - and I'm saying this as someone who enjoys fast paced works- so that we could kind of digest what happened and prepare for what will happen next. Because a lot happens in this movie... a lot. Editing is also a bit disjointed for my taste.It's also very action-heavy with exploding this and shooting up that every other minute. It's almost like someone had a good idea, then it got butchered and hollywood-ized.Overall it is watchable, it does make you curious because of the concept, and doesn't really beat around the bush, but it doesn't give you a lot either.",Tenet
1358,bozabozidar,Disasterously bad,2,22 September 2020,"This pretentious action blockbuster is by far the worst movie by Christopher Nolan, and if you remove all the (undeserving) hype surrounding it, you will find a disappointingly mediocre movie with bad directing, bad screenplay, bad pacing, bad editing and abysmal camerawork. The actual plot is paper-thin and predictable (about a group of secret agents who must prevent an evil terrorist from destroying the world etc), but what makes the movie incomprehensible is the annoying shaky-cam that is dominant in most action scenes and which becomes even more pronounced as the movie progresses. What also bothered me is how most scenes end way too abruptly, with the narration jumping from one continent to another so quickly that the viewer gets lost in all the jump-cuts. Furthermore, the characters are all one-dimensional and everybody speeks in a needlessly cryptic jargon that's full of codewords and abbreviations. It seems to me that the whole story aspect about time-travel and ""reverse entropy"" is just a cheap supperficial gimmick that's supposed to justify extravagant special effects and draw attention from the movie's numerous flaws. I don't think this movie deserves so much hype since it's really a complete wreck with flaws in every department.",Tenet

The film itself is already very loud but the 'mood' music - which is heavy, droning and very bassy - is the dominating factor throughout. The plot is quite complex and, being unable to her hear most of the actors conversations means much of it is lost. So, not only frustrating to watch but also painful. My ears rang for a good few hours afterwards - and that was after the cinema staff had kindly turned the volume down a tad at my request. Like Interstellar, I will probably enjoy this film a lot more once it is available to watch at home where, for some strange reason, the audio was so much better.",Tenet
1362,mattflohr,A thinking man's movie for morons,4,1 April 2021,"""Don't think about it too much,"" a character tells Protagonist early on in the film, whose name reeks of banality masquerading as artistry. Appropriately, this film can't decide whether it's audience should have an IQ of 170 to understand everything or switch their brains off completely every time something completely stupefyingly dumb happens, which is often. Make up your mind movie! Stupendously baffling in a way that only Nolan can pull off, Tenet (whose name is one of many pointless marketing gimmicks) is almost equal parts clever and idiotic. Interweaving plot threads of people going back and forth in time is a neat concept and there are some good moments here. Pattison is good. Lots of good ideas but nothing really holds up under scrutiny. The action scenes have a ""look at how smart and cool we are"" attitude whilst having no substance of any kind. A temporal pincer movement sounds cool on paper but when Nolan directs it it's just a bunch of people running around getting blown up and un-blown up. And for the whole 150 minutes I'm too busy trying to figure out the last crazy time thing that happened while it keeps unloading more boring and cryptic plot points on top of everything. There's a crushing weight of nonsensery suffocating this film. Let's start with the basic physics of going backwards in time. I can buy the backwards air explanation. But is their blood flowing backwards too? Is their food un-digesting? Are light particles leaving their eyes and travelling to the sun? It also fails to have internal logic which ruins any chance of suspending disbelief. How do bullet holes appear on solid objects from backwards guns before they travel to that point in the past from the future? And why don't they appear on people in the same way? If the holes appear before the shots or explosions then how and when exactly do they appear? From peoples' will like the reverse gun drop thing? Why do people attacking backwards in cars literally drive backwards from a normal perspective? If you were attacking in a car in reverse time it would make more sense to point the car forward and simply have it in reverse gear so from your perspective you're un-backwards driving... but I guess that would be less visual? Why doesn't un-shooting someone heal their damage? If Pattinson recruited Protagonist but Protagonist actually recruited Pattinson then isn't that a paradox? There'a like a gajillion of these kinds of questions that check me out of the movie constantly. And don't even get me started on the actual plot. The bad guy is supposed to be a super genius who knows everything that's going to happen but the characters easily outwit him in increasingly asinine ways. He looked right at the backwards Protagonist in the car as they did the switcheroo with MacGuffin #9 but he didn't think to send some cross-time messages to himself or something? Where did all these armies of time soldiers come from? What was with the opera scene at the beginning and Protagonist's near death experience? I kept expecting a twist with that. At least this thing is slightly better than Dunkirk. Also the sound effects are way too loud but I guess that's Nolan's MO. If you want a good smart time travel movie watch Primer or Coherence instead.",Tenet

1366,stanimiradeleva,The most pathetic female character in recent movie history,5,1 December 2020,"***Spoilers ahead, but who cares, right***In general, this movie is ok, it is not terrible to watch. The protagonist is an interesting character, at least in the first part of the movie. He is trying some James-Bondesque moves at the beginning of the movie, and playing it all smooth and elegant spy (although you start to wonder how the transition from a SWAT officer to a costume-wearing, martini-sipping international spy happens so fast). The sidekick (played brilliantly by Robert Pattinson) is probably the best part of the movie. The action and special effects are superb. I didn't have a problem with the dialogue as I use subtitles anyway. The story was masked as extraordinarily complicated, in order to lure the viewers to believe they are watching something interesting and valuable and feel smart when they understand some of the sci-fi parts. Well, at some point you stop pretending that the sciency stuff makes any sense and start paying attention to the story. And then the problems of this movie come to the surface, as it is actually so shallow, that the muddy pseudoscientific nonsense can barely cover it.
The female lead character was so incredibly dull, shallow, pathetic, full of cliches, and not making any sense in general, that I started to get angry every time she opens her mouth. With her appearance, she threw away 50 years of female character development and empowerment to the trash. She was so incredibly weak, inconsiderate, unintelligent, unable to grasp the information, presented to her, spending her time between crying, begging, laying, making stupid decisions, and doing the opposite of what she's been asked to. Almost as if the creator of the character was only aware of the female characters from 40 years ago, when the sole purpose of the women in movies was to wear dresses and scream while being saved. I am not even sure what was her purpose, except to become the reason for 2-3 action scenes. At some point, she was given a task - to mind her own business for an hour and to try not to kill her own husband. A task, that would decide the future of mankind. A task, which she failed, and then she was like ""I just couldn't let him die in peace, I knew you would think of another way to save mankind. I just had to kill him"". Well, bravo, so reasonable ... so brave! I don't think she even understood what were people trying to tell her, as there was one point when the Protagonist was explaining, that all people are going to die and she just sighted ""including my son"". Of course, including your son you, broken lightbulb! She was so Why was the protagonist risking the destruction of the whole freaking universe, just to help her, even if they weren't even romantically involved? The only way this whole thing would make sense would be if the son is actually Neil, which is not really profoundly clever and it's just an excuse for a sequel.The villain - the Russian mob - he was just a cartoon of a character. His intentions were so unbelievably stupid. That reason to end the world made no sense. And to keep his wife as a hostage, using some painting ... how is that going to work?In general, the creators of the movie spent so much time and effort to prepare the special effects, the sci-fi element, and the action scenes, that they probably realized they don't have a story and characters, and they just scrambled something in the last minute and poured it in the mix. The result is some half-baked movie that doesn't satisfy anyone's taste.",Tenet
1367,peterspam-22486,Poor execution of an original idea,4,11 December 2020,"Upfront, I will always hold Christopher Nolan in high regard for some of his previous titles: Memento was a fascinating classic, Interstellar was able to appeal to sentiment and Nolan's Batman series was better than most of the light entertainment subgenre. What Inception was able to achieve however, to combine action with an abstract concept, Tenet fails miserably at, on several accounts.For starters, the cast was sub par. Putting in an irrelevant cameo role by the ever perfect Michael Caine does not save a movie where the main characters are shallow at best and do not fit their role. I'm going to say it: John David Washington is not an A-class actor. His sidekick would easily have made for a better main character and unfortunately that tells a lot. A movie like Tenet that can become a messy heap of unclarified science mixed with a compendium of hidden agendas needs a protagonist you can identify with, either because he's totally lost and shows his human side, or because he's reassuring through his admirable abilities. Our Tenet hero however is just not credible. As a terrorist in any B-movie he would be a perfect fit with an ever-present stern aggression in his eyes, but this is not what we expect from the main character of a movie with so many twists and chances to shine. I did not for a single moment associate with him in his ventures and that tells a lot about both script and actor.The storyline is confusing to say the least. Right from the start, much of the ""science"" is left unexplained and just taken for granted. ""There is something very mystical, just take it for granted and be thrilled"" cannot be palated by the ""demonstration"" of a special bullit. If it is not credible, it will remain a mumbo-jumbo that quickly falls outside of our scope, while it should actually be the driving force behind this movie, which lacks in all other fields of character development, special effects, identification with events or characters. A missed opportunity, which was done much better in Inception and Memento was masterful at it, by revealing it step by step through reversed chronology.
The twists and turns in the plot quickly become overwhelming and despite their weight, seem rather casually linked and do not add a feeling of discovery or ""Aha!"" feeling to the overall storyline. Missed opportunities, again good ideas but poor writing.
Also, from one moment to the other we are thrown into an end-of-the-world scenario, which I am still not 100% sure about whether I understand its implications. (The poor movie audio did not exacly help connecting the dots either.)The role of some characters is forced upon us without a realistic causality. Why would the otherwise from plot perspective totally irrelevant (antagonist's) wife need to be saved like she was a pivotal point for humanity, when her role was to NOT kill the bad guy and only gained its relevance towards the end of the movie? Even then there would have been a plethora of options to achieve the end result. For appeal to some sort of sentiment, the main goal of saving humanity gets confused with a tertiary goal of saving the soul of a single human being (who simply made bad life choices).Let me not even start about all the really poor plot points, like a hardened Russian armsdealer who talks about feeding you your balls, then practically drowns (in a vest!) by a plunge during sailing. never mind the absurdly slow reaction time when his wife cuts (!) the rope. Professional assassins getting surprised by finding a person on their back seat, billionaires' security guards getting surprised by two men entering via the balcony, the list is just too long.Sure, the action scenes are fun enough to watch with some original ideas like the plane hijack and the building climb/exit, but most action was quite predictable and should have been much shorter. While the concept of two different time-lines for people (and explosions?..) at the same time is an interesting concept, the battle scenes looked more like something out of the satirical Starship Troopers, rather than an exciting watch.Overall, it is a messy movie, chaotic in every aspect. It feels like Nolan wanted to put too much into this pot and lost the main plot from sight, which led to a feeling of emptiness at the end. If you ask me next week what the movie was about, the only thing I'll probably remember is that the Amalfitana coast has beautiful scenery and there were cars driving backwards.",Tenet
1368,vladhxh,One of the best sci-fi movies of the century,10,23 August 2021,"This movie got the unfortunate cold shoulder from the viewers and the critics alike. The invincible Christopher Nolan really got defeated at his own game. All the parts that make his movies the intellectual blockbusters are there. Great cinematography, huge sets, non-stop action, exceptional acting, clever dialogue, an elaborate strong story and a clever idea taken to the extreme. I actually loved every minute of it and recommend it to anyone who loves strong original sci-fi.This is probably the most complicated and smart movie made by Nolan (and it's a guy who made Memento and Inception, mind you), and this is probably it's demise - it's probably too clever and complicated for its own good. It's like a movie version of Einstein's general relativity, most people will completely lose it 20 minutes in. It sometimes seems that the movie was made for the future generations of ubermensch, who will eventually understand it (shortly before destroying the world, of course).It is the first movie I had to watch twice in order to understand it, and I still did not understand some of it. Memento and Inception and anything else considered intellectually challenging is child play in comparison. Understandably, people usually do not like to be made to feel stupid for 3 hours straight. However, for sci-fi fans out there, this is one of the best sci-fi stories, it's intellectually rich and although it doesn't completely make sense and there are loops and maybe even holes, it is engaging and rewarding entertainment.It is a shame that this movie became Nolan's flop, hopefully it won't impact his sellability in the future, as he is way ahead of virtually everything Hollywood has to offer. Probably next time he will need to dumb it down enough, so it will work better for an average moviegoer, leaving enough cleverness for people who don't mind to be intellectually challenged by blockbusters. But for me Tenet is great, clever and fun as it is, and I wouldn't change a thing.",Tenet
1369,diogolaforga,Overly complex but extremely creative,7,18 December 2020,"Nowadays with the current main stream cinema within hollywood, Tenet really feels like a breeze of fresh air and Christopher Nolan keeps proving that less conventional storytelling still holds its place and solidifies more than ever the importance that this type of filmaking is still very much alive despite all the commercial diversity and social justice tendencies most recent films are grounded on.
Nolan is well known for is non linear story telling and for trying to break the mold by using ""out of the box"" structures and unconvencional themes.
In that sense, Tenet feels like the culmination of this philosophy, in it´s most pure form.
This feels like the amalgam of what the director is trying to achieve with this type of story telling, as Tenet is very much a destiled product derived from his previous films, from style to form. We can almost ""smell"" the ingredients from his past movies added to Tenets recipe. From the high concept of Interstellar to the fighting scenes found in Batman, to the reversed structure like Memento and of course the multi layered story featured in Inception.
Despite all of this I did not find it an easy movie to watch, because of the rules and themes that the story engages and thats why it´s probably best understood through several viewings. The problem is that I have no desire whatsoever to watch it again, because it´s too demanding. There were times where I just felt burned and almost started disengaging from all the rules and techno babble going on because I was starting to feel tired.
The cinematography is great as to be expected but the characters and the story suffer in detriment of the concept and the heavy rules that it comprises and expects the audience to understand.
Personally, I´ve felt that the story and everything else for that matter, seemed secondary to the concept in itself. A strange sacrifice that willingly or not, seeped into the film. Some scenes take place in a manner that embelishes the pure proess of the concept but ultimately hurts the story, when characters are required to do some actions that revolve around the rules that Tenet sets but are almost done in a way that tries to assure minimal understanding by the audience of said rules and were only woven in the story itself later. It´s almost like they had to create such scenes for us to better understand the concept in wich it deals, while in the plots concern it´s just, protagonist as to go from ""A"" to ""B"", to retrieve ""C"" and ultimatly use it against ""D"". The fusion between these two elements in its majority gets lost in translation, not helped by the sheer effort we need to concentrate just to grasp it all, while the script does its best to avoid heavy handed exposition.
The characters themselves suffer from this prioritisation, embodied for instance in the form of ""the Protagonist"" once again. Through out the movie we get to know what type of character ""Protagonist"" is, as in, we know his profile but we dont know anything else. We know nothing of his past, his personal drive or motivations, besides the obvious ""saving the world"" category. He is a charismatic character, like others in the film but his role is basically ""walk"" with the audience and help us understand the ground rules as he himself is learning them.
The fact that ""the real enemy"" is never shown, consolidates this further as we the audience can relate to the stakes but can´t quite figure this invisible enemy, despite knowing who it is.
The film just feels overly complex, and in it´s complexity, creates room for error through its contrived rules.
That said and on the other side of the prism, the use of entropy and reversion seems an interesting topic to seed it´s premise and at the same time, sets the stage for an incredible visual use of time´s perception, and exquisite action pieces that make the most from these rules, elevating the film.
The rest of the subplots are designed to fit the premise but it never really feels significant enough, on the overall notion of things.
The final message also seems a little forced on the story as if it needed something more profound conecting it all but never really clicks in a way that you feel that everything was very well woven.

I saw it. luckily, on an IMAX screen , and the Bass audio (and more) was thrilling and intense, seats vibrated.
Ludwig Göransson's score is fitting the film, in that is is at times unsettling, but also accentuates the intricacies and feeling of the plot.And the lead actors are all Extremely good here. I felt scared for 'Kat' when Kenneth Branagh's 'Sator' was really menacing, not overacting i m o.
John David Washington as 'the Lead '(Protagonist) was fenomenal.
Also Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki, Hats off!And did i mention that is is a SPECTACULAR film? It is! And many stunning landscapes to view.9/10 from me.
Well Done Chr. NOLAN. Pity the Corona-crisis/Covid seems to be truncating the box-office revenue for this one. It deserves massive crowds seeing it in the cinema, which is now sadly not possible.",Tenet

1389,sethklee-77687,"An Intriguing, Creative Spy Thriller",8,12 September 2020,"An intriguing, fast-paced, and creative spy thriller. It has an interesting concept for you to wrap your brain around that kept my brain stimulated for the duration. I saw a lot of people say they thought it was overly convoluted, but it felt fine to me (although those I watched it with disagree). Maybe my advantage going into it was I could hear the dialogue alright (many complained about the audio mixing) and I could keep up with everything going on in the film for the most part. But, I also could be missing much of it while not even realizing it. It's hard to know, because analyzing one aspect of the movie requires you to wrap your brain around the entire thing at once. I also saw some complaining about the exposition, but it was definitely necessary and it flowed fine for me.While still a solid movie, I think it would have been better with more fledged out characters. The only character we really got an in-depth look into was Kat. The rest of them were written generally the same as most protagonists and I feel the film could have benefited more from their persons being explored. Also, while the movie was fast-paced and action scenes were fun and innovative, I felt the urge for more gritty, brutal fight scenes rather than the many times we were given simple headlocks. While holes (or the opposite: more aspects coming to light) could become apparent to me on a rewatch, for now this sits in my mind as a solid action film. Certainly not Nolan's best, but certainly more unique and captivating than most blockbusters.7.6/10",Tenet

They even stole from Netflix Dark!",4,2 January 2021,"Wow what can I say, Huge Nolan fan but I am so disappointed and I fear Nolan may have peaked and it's all downhill from here, hopefully not and this is just one bad movie fingers crossed, although he seems convinced this is his greatest project so far (it is the worst)Tenet has a promising concept but all we got out of it is ""cool looking"" rewind action, and it does feel like the whole thing was done just as an Nolan experiment on how rewind action would look like.This was also clearly Nolan's attempt at a James Bond movie, the boats, exotic locations, scenery shots, lonely abused woman, cartoonish Russian villain, but it was so poorly executed. He always wanted to direct a James Bond movie so this was him executing that vision and failing so hard.The acting and performance is so bad and amateur, just couldn't stand it. In some scenes it's so horrible and laughable. The main actor is such a bad casting, his voice is so soft, he is short as a hobbit, and has no personality, no charm, the movie tries really hard to sell us that he's a charming smart secret agent, but he fails to deliver any of that, no wonder all he got was a friendzoned kiss on the forehead.The editing maybe the worst and most bizzare I've ever seen with lots and lots of mistakes, a lot of conversation scenes feel like they have been shot separately with as they never show them in the same shot, the camera keeps jumping from person to person in seconds, looks like a high school film projectThe movie cost $350 million apparently with nothing to show for. Many of the effects look fake and exploding buildings clearly made of styrofoam.The soundtrack was non existent, it was literally the trailer music just played constantly in a loop, so annoying, I really hope Nolan brings back Hans zimmer. Speech is hardly audible every actor is whispering it's so bizzare to watchI won't spoil it but the ending is so bad and laughable, that final battle scene is so poorly scripted, everyone running and shooting in the air what a joke! most of the movie and plot is so badly written but I gave it a chance only for it to end in such a terrible way, anyone following the Netflix series dark will understand the ending is stolen from the plot of Netflix show DarkI really hope Nolan listens to his audience, his next project is a remake of memnto completely unnecessary, which is why I fear we may have seen peak Nolan",Tenet
1391,elwynchofmann,A visual masterpiece that will leave you scratching your head,8,1 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan delivers a draw-dropping spectacle. Tenet is a visual masterpiece accompanied by an amazing score by Ludwig Goransson. The acting is also very well done by everyone involved. Besides visuals and sound, this film very much depends on its complex plot revolving around time and ""inversion"". If you thought Inception was complicated, this will be an overwhelming movie to watch. Personally, I found myself trying to play catch-up with this movie, and just as I was starting to understand something that happened 15 minutes ago, there's something totally different unraveling onscreen, and I just couldn't keep up. The sound mix is also configured to a point where the dialogue is virtually incomprehensible without subtitles. With a film that depends heavily on its plot, its important to be able to hear the exposition when every word is necessary for the audience understand. I found that not being able to understand the plot significantly lowered the stakes for me. With Inception, the stakes were simple: if you die in a dream, you go into limbo. In Tenet, however, time is so complex and confusing that it is hard to understand what the goal of the mission is and who is at stake. The movie tells me everyone is at stake, but I just didn't feel it because I couldn't quite understand it. There is some great moments of foreshadowing that make you think back to earlier in the movie and connect the dots, which is neat. This is definitely a movie that will become more understandable and enjoyable after multiple viewings, similar to lots of Nolan films. I will definitely be getting the blu-ray so I can witness the beautiful sound and images put on display in Tenet... and turn on subtitles. 8/10",Tenet

Unlike other Nolan movies this one will feel very fast. There is barely an explanation of anything and things start happening fast. This can be disorienting and difficult to understand on first watch.This is actually intended that way because this movie gets better and better on further viewings. The whole thing will ultimately feel like a recursion.The dialogs are short and witty unlike previous Nolan movies. The acting of protagonist and Niel is brilliant.

It is important to just relax, and watch and let things click if, and when they do.This film does a great job of taking time every now and again to summarise and fill in the blanks, wait for those. I think because I wasn't worrying about trying to figure it out the whole time, that when they came up they were obvious and explained things well (up to that point anyway).I debated giving this movie a 9 due to how complex it was, borderline too complex but I realised that's just the subject matter and there was no other way to do it. The fact they pulled off a great movie with this complexity made it for me. I can't imagine how hard this was to write, let alone direct. Thinking of that and how well it was executed made me realise it needs a 10 because nothing else let it down. Acting, all brilliant, pace and screenplay the same. Reasons for people all doing things worked in line with their characters which is rare these days, so there's no other score from me but a 10 for Tenet.I read in a lot of reviews sound was an issue, if you can't hear words I can see how that would make the movie too difficult as some explanations are one liners. I watched a Blu-Ray DVD version and had no issues with 7.1 surround.TLDR

Apart from genuinely enjoying your movies, I truly admire the immense respect you show towards your work and your viewers by perfecting each and every angle of your scripts so that there are no gaps or plotholes although you are dealing with mind-boggling subjects like time travel. But please admit that whilst you have tried to outdo yourself with Tenet, you have instead overdone it to the point where it simply ceases to make any sense. Although the movie is very enjoyable, the script just does not work. There are too many questions left unanswered, too many plotholes and nothing in the way of proper explanation; and this comes as no surprise because the concept of 'inversion' is so half-baked that it falls apart after the first 45 minutes.

1415,nindave-movies,Tenet fails in many of these vital aspect's..,5,26 August 2020,"My definition of a good film; , an engaging, intriguing, gripping storyline. A script that can be followed. Good acting, interaction and empathy between characters that the audience can latch on to. Feeling I want a character to succeed in what ever there cause maybe. Visual stunning and a soundtrack that provides the final glue to bring it all together. Making the whole film leaving me entertain.
Tenet fails in many of these vital aspect's. It starts off well, giving the viewer the antipation that a very hyped blockbusting movie is going to fill the next 2 hours. But, it soon becomes apparent that I really don't care what happens to any of the characters. The soundtrack is way too loud and mainly electronic bass generated garage music. The sound in places let's the actors down as words are drowned by the music, especially in scenes when they are wearing head gear, helmets etc. Robert Pattinson, however put in a good performance, and is growing in every film he does. Elizabeth Debciki did what, many can't, make and impact and presence when on screen excellent. Unfortunately, her on screen Russian husband, doesn't quiet work for me. Modelling Marks and Spencer holiday shirt's, while on his superyacht and accent honed from Agatha Christie's many baddies does not make a 200million budget film work..
In summary, I was looking forward to an exciting blockbusting film. What I got was a confluted storyline that was just ridiculous, with action scenes that were like any other Hollywood movie with good special effects.My hope now is that 'Blockbuster' films to follow, Black Widow, Wonder Women 1984 and James Bond will I am sure prove better all round entertainment, soundtracks, stunts and empathy with characters.Which is what I want, from the cinema experience.",Tenet

Like a clockwork, this movie lacks emotion, humanity, passion. It's busy encoding hermetic symbolism into pop culture artefacts for mass consumption.Christopher Nolan at this point is Stanley Kubrik 2 returns, he is that preoccupied with infusing his movies with the occult. He abandoned the art of cinema.Sure, decoding the occult doctrine woven into his riddles pretending to be movies may be interesting, for a while. But his artefacts are cumbersome, clunky, negligent.Tenet is like Matrix 2 and 3, boring to no end. I skipped through scenes with the function to explain stuff that doesn't even matter.

The concept is actually quite simple compares to his others films but the way it was executed is...well can't say it's horrible because nobody really know how forward and reverse time will interact with each other. As the film itself said don't try to understand it, feel it...The simple fact is if they can change the time direction at well, and they want to help the past self like every other time traveling movies. Isn't it simpler just travel back in time in reverse to the past, then switch to forward to perform the aid. Instead of trying to help forward time while in reverse and let the whole thing becomes a hot mess?The whole plot and special effect is built on this going in reverse time while helping forward time concept, so it's just plain stupid at this point. Especially at some point they did switch back to forward first while trying to change the past so it's not like they didn't think about it. Visual effect is great we get to see many things played in reverse, but it gets old pretty quickly and we have already seen too many of these reverse videos on YouTube.Other Christopher Nolan's films usually also take some time to digest, and I always end up watching second time to discover more things.

In addition, the characters only explain tiny bits of info to each other and suddenly everyone of them is an expert on handling the reverse-time. The movie intentionally obscures the idea in order for us, the viewers, to lose track of the many plot holes that are there.
Not going into any spoilers, but watch the movie again and pay attention, some characters know things that they are not supposed to know at their exact point in time, but they know it anyway to keep the plot going forward.
Nolan admitted to cheating a bit in his movies and I don't blame him, an idea like that is very hard to pull off, but I expected more from a perfectionist that brought us some of the best sci-fi movies along with the best Batman trilogy.

Far from it. There is no doubt that Nolan is at the top of his game, but I found the film hard to follow, and like many other reviewers much of the dialogue hard to understand (because many key scenes had actors talking while wearing headgear that muffled their voices to the point of unintelligibility).Going into the theatre I thought that if the film was all I hoped it would be, I would return for a second or even third look (which I did for the Joker movie).

1430,SnekDok,"""to be fair, you have to have a really high IQ to understand Rick and Mor- oh wait""",3,24 May 2021,"Yep. It's another one of those. Though I've never watch Rick and Morty I can say it most likely has better writing.This movie takes a concept that could be cool at first glance and then when you actually drill down (not deep) and look at it (for 5 sec), is absolutely stupid. ""Imagine.. a bullet that functions in reverse time"" .... *hits blunt*.Those that are like ""i dont get it...."". You do... its just stupid. The concept itself is just dumb. Like travelling back in time like Back to the Future is not at all possible and never will be... mainly because the casual term time as we think about it, is hours and minutes and years and so on. In reality its a measurement we use to calculate growth of things. Plants, humans etc grow...die decay and the amount of time it takes is how we measure it. You can't UNDO that growth of the entire universe to be back at a state where things were ""the 60's"". And even if you could, it would still be current year but the things would be reverted. Anyway... the reason we love back to the future and movies like that is because when they go back on this impossible concept... there are rules, even in the ridiculousness. Those rules are based on fundamental basic principles.This movie the rules are just grabbed out of thin air... whenever they decide they need to progress a plotline.. they just do the thing in reverse. Then later show the thing happening normally... in reverse. There's no rules or reason... stuff just happens backwards from the view of those in the present and its just stupid.Hated it. The acting all around was solid though.",Tenet
1431,alexismaria02,An enchanting thriller,9,31 August 2020,"""Don't try to understand it. Feel it.""
Woah! From its first few seconds, I tried to do exactly what the qoute from above says and... it worked. This is exactly one of those few films that you should ""feel"", not analyse too much while watching.
It's been quite a few months without any kind of cinema and to come back and see Tenet is truly a gift. This is one of those films that constantly keep you guessing and just when you ""think"" you've figured it out, well... you didn't. This is the beauty of it. This is the beauty of Christopher Nolan, who once again proves how much of a genius he is. The film is an enchanting emotional rollercoaster, that takes you on a one of a kind journey as a viewer. It makes you feel curoius at all times. Rarely do such big blockbuster films manage to do that, but Chris Nolan did it without trying to much.
As a huge fan of Chris Nolan, I had quite big expectations from this film, but I can honestly say that he took me by surprise. He's shown once more what he is capable of, by transposing his genius ideas onto the screen. In the recent years he managed to take his direction ""style"" to the next level and you could totally see it even here in his latest feature film. He has become more and more mature in his direction/writing and even though each and every single one of his films has something special about it, he continues to evolve as a filmmaker day by day, which is quite pleasant to witness.
When it comes to the acting, I honestly think that John David Washington did an amazing job as The Protagonist. He was really present and engaged at all times, managing to keep his emotions in place and delivering exactly what the audience wanted. As expected, Robert Pattinson was nothing but excellent. He has become such a diverse and versatile actor in the recent years and he is starting to deliver one great performance after another. Although he doesn't get that much screentime, he is killing each and every scene he is in. His accent was just the perfect ""touch"" to his charismatic character and overall I have to say that he was just fantastic everytime he was on the screen. Not to mention the fact that his charcater might just be the key to this whole film and those final 5 minutes were absolutely great from his part. Also, his on screen chemistry with John David was simply great and I hope to see them again soon. Kenneth Branagh and Elizabeth Debicki were also quite good, but I expected a bit more from Kenneth's part, especially in a few moments in which he overplayed his emotions.
To be honest, the score in this picture was utterly amazing. Ludwig Göransson did such a great job at capturing the audience in the most important scenes with what he has composed and at times you almost feel like the music is the one part that makes you feel those intense emotions.
As for the cinematography, every scene was beautifully shot and the color palette was quite unique and complex most of the times.
Overall, I feel like Tenet will slowly become one of my favourite Nolan films, as it a truly unique and mesmerizing thriller from beginning until the end. I personally loved every second of it and most importantly, I loved how much it made me think and analyse afterwards. I will definitely give it a second watch in the next few days and try to understand it more, but for now I'm just going to enjoy its greatness. If you have the chance to see it, then you should do so, as you won't regret it!",Tenet
1432,dishjones,Nolan is just a little too ambitious,7,15 January 2021,"This movie was amazing cinematically and is one of the most ambitious ideas for a movie that I've ever seen. However, Nolan just doesn't pull off the execution well enough to keep you interested let alone following along.",Tenet
1433,jhonculada,A different take on time-travel,9,12 January 2021,"I've always enjoyed Nolan's movies and this proved no exception. It definitely deserves a second watch, because it's impossible to link everything together the first time. Subtitles definitely help, because sometimes accents are hard to understand. Also, if you happen to have an advanced physics degree or understand entropy, that helps, too!What I loved the most was the idea of how you can travel through time by reversing entropy and your relation with the world around you. It made for wonderful cinematic viewing.Lastly: I love how genius the very name of the movie is. Tenet is a palindrome (the same forwards as backwards, which applies to time travel). Additionally, Tenet references the final 10-minutes that the characters have to save the world. They are traveling forwards and backwards in the last 10-min (the temporal pincer move). Enjoy unpacking other delights like this throughout.I look forward to someone diagraming the timeline in this movie. We can all use it!",Tenet
1434,alexgataric,"Good action movie, hard to follow",7,17 December 2020,"I found it hard to follow and the concept of moving backwards in time didn't make a lot of sense to me. Still, great acting all the way around with good action scenes.",Tenet
1435,Gazoopi,An attempt to be overly clever and failing miserably,4,1 September 2020,"I went to see this film, full of expectation. Firstly, after the long cinema closures it was good to be a cinema goer again. Secondly, a promised reopening with a highly built up film from the Director of Inception, was certainly going to be worth donning a mask for. Well, it wasn't. The storyline was faulty, the tooing and froing causing initial confusion, which evolved into complete boredom before the final scenes arrived. The film came across as a feeble attempt at hitting a highly complex action thriller with mish mash of crazy, unrealistic ideas. Not worth going out for.",Tenet
1436,svenfuhrmann,A legendary,10,19 January 2021,"The fact that director Christopher Nolan has a pronounced penchant for philosophy and especially for physics should be known to everyone who knows the films ""Interception"" or ""Interstellar"". Even in the war film ""Dunkirk"" this tendency is present, because there, too, Christopher Nolan develops three chronological storylines that have a different temporal beginning, run completely different in time and still end up in one storyline and always in the same direction. Here the term time still applies according to the principle that many routes of the action always lead to the same destination station and that is the end of the film.Actually, you could call Christopher Nolan the Albert Einstein of film history, but that would be almost an insult. Christopher Nolan is namely the Niels Bohr of film history, who cinematically celebrates his own cinematic universe of quantum physics and its content-related entanglement in a cinematic multiverse. This spooky long-distance effect of the action, which seems to work without time and space, is now the basis for the next film from the microcosm of the Nolan worldview.Christopher Nolan really takes it to the extreme in this film. It is already known that for him the past, the present and the future coexist in a reality, as if it were the train stations of reality and not the time that drives from one to the other aggregate states in order to let this arise. Past, present and future are not the effect of cause time, but time is the subjective individual effect between the causes (stations) present, past and future, which exist at the same time. And now we come to the concept of entropy, which Christopher Nolan uses to the full in this film, because entropy is the ordered timetable so that the individual trains do not collide with each other in reality.Every viewer knows the fact that the effect always comes after the cause. From a mathematical point of view, one can also get back from the effect to the cause, because both directions are mathematically possible, as is the title of the film. No matter from which direction you read the title, it always comes out Tenet. Why is that? Some scientists are of the opinion that cause and effect both exist simultaneously in reality, like the beginning and the end of a word, and man and nature, due to entropy, go through both simultaneously existing states in an order like reading a word following the definition always starts with the state of absolute order and approaches the state of absolute disorder. This path is viewed subjectively as time that actually does not exist in reality, but only exists in the world of each individual. Would you like a little example? Let's look at cause and effect like two railway stations. If the passenger gets on the train station cause and wants to drive according to the effect, does the effect only exist when the passenger has arrived there? At least not according to Christopher Nolan's definition, because in this film we have two passengers and at which station they board the train should be clear. Who now asks, where is the known time? That's the train itself and there are a lot of trains in this film.Since the term time and the associated direction always relates to the individual, the entropy is thus an individual-related direction, like a ticket that an individual purchases at birth. But what happens now when every individual and every object can determine the direction of the entropy themselves, as if reality were a travel agency? This brings us to the content of the film and it really adds up, so that you have to watch the film several times in order to find your own personal direction in the film.Basically, the plot feels like a James Bond offshoot. You start with a terrorist attack in Kiev. The CIA tries to prevent this attack with a secret operation and as luck would have it, the Afro-American James Bond in the form of the protagonist is already there to get in the mood. Now you have to know what protagonist means, because this also makes the role of Kenneth Branagh clear. A protagonist is the ""first to act"" and to this there is a particle connected with him. These two spatially separated particles can exchange information about their properties instantaneously (i.e. without a time delay). The name of this particle is the antagonist. So the protagonist and antagonist are also connected to each other and if one goes around to the right, the other immediately goes around to the left. The two main characters in the film are now also defined and the James Bond offshoot could actually begin now, were it not for the entropy between the train stations cause and effect.Right at the beginning the viewer is drawn into the vortex of physical terms and he will find that the passage of time and the associated entropy is no longer the same here. Our protagonist finds parts where the cause is the result of the effect. What applies to small parts of the microcosm also applies to large parts up to and including a nuclear war in the future. The protagonist is at the cause of the conflict and wants to prevent the effect of the nuclear war, while our antagonist Andrei Sator is at the effect and moves back in time to ensure the cause in order to secure his right to exist.But how do two protagonists / antagonists fight each other who move in exactly different directions within the entropy? This is where our quantum physicist Christopher Nolan comes into play and now lets the atomic particles of reality loose on the viewer. There are no three storylines of the past, the present and the future, because all three states are always present in the film at the same time and they interact in almost every scene in the same reality until the viewer no longer knows which train he is currently on and what the destination station is. It should also be clear that writing a review for this film should actually not be possible according to the film definition, because a review has a beginning and an end. Even the film review would have to be written in such a way that one would have to read it from both sides and still come to the same conclusion, namely the plot of the film.Conclusion:
This film is a quantum physical journey between the train stations of the past, present and future and the viewer sits in front of the film's railway lines and is allowed to deliberately think about which train he is currently seeing and which passengers are now sitting on which train, because it gets even more absurd The passengers also switch trains in this Nolan reality between the past, present and future stations and also interact with each other according to the cause and effect principle. I wish the viewer a lot of fun looking for the next train connection.",Tenet
1437,caleblimsw,Christopher Nolan sacrifices character for plot and concept-and nearly succeeds,9,5 September 2020,"Non-spoiler.Stunningly original and woven with sublime intricacy, Christopher Nolan's action-thriller abounds with incredible set-pieces and a delightfully tricky storyline that showcases his skill at creating coherent worlds filled with the wildest of concepts. Cinematographic brilliance from Hoyte van Hoytema and some standout tracks from Ludwig Goransson complete the mystique and wonderfully unique atmosphere and contribute to an undoubtedly technically masterful film.Tenet is severely lacking in character development, with little emotional engagement that is not generated by the superb portrayals by Pattinson, Washington and Debicki. Character motivations are also veiled and frustratingly shallow and unexplored. Beyond this, the plot suffers from a lack of clarity in the final act, and a general reliance on exposition.This is a movie that focuses on the power of it's intriguing concepts and it's intricately threaded plot, weaving a remarkably tense and gripping narrative, pulling on Nolan's trademark skill of foreshadowing and set-up to create a film which rewards the viewer for their close attention.Not for everyone, and by no means his best.8.7/10 for me as a Nolan fan and lover of puzzle-box plots, objectively would lower that to 8/10.",Tenet

had taken more than five years to write
the screenplay due to deliberating about Tenet's central ideas. Tenet was
produced by his wife Emma Thomas,
she has frequently collaborated
with him on numerous works such as
The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception,
Interstellar, The Prestige, and Dunkirk.The plot follows a secret agent portrayed
by John David Washington. The actor certainly has proven that he can anchor
as he provides a satisfying performance as a man who is determined to accomplish his objective by any means necessary. Talent must run in the family as he is the son of two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington.I am looking forward to viewing his other performances in the motion picture industry. Accompanying him onscreen are Robert Pattison and Elizabeth Debicki who provide charismatic performances as Neil
and Kat assisting him on his mission towards preventing a universal threat. Ludwig Göransson engulfs the film with a memorable and pulse-pounding score and Jackson Spidell's fight co-ordination is not only tense but engaging as we witness backward
and forward fight sequences.Tenet is one of the most intelligent films released this year. We are introduced to concepts forming the narrative's over-arching story such as backwards-moving entropy, non-linear thinking and temporal paradoxes.As complicated as that may sound,
the script is polished wonderfully to where everything introduced falls cohesively into the film's closing act. I never could have imagined watching this film at home. I cannot
wait to view it a second time.The main negative that I can share
about the film is the dialogue is muddled in certain scenes due to the sound mixing.I recommend subtitles for those

1445,johnterrell-67238,"Breathtaking, if not a bit empty",8,20 September 2020,"Tenet is the new film by accomplished filmmaker Christopher Nolan, starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, and Kenneth Branagh. I would usually give some kind of spoiler free plot synopsis before reviewing, but for Tenet that seems near impossible without A) going on for too long or B) spoiling something from the movie. The film is beyond intricately woven, as Christopher Nolan is going all out on his trademark extremely complex, plot heavy style. Conceptually, it was fascinating and the film-making itself was utterly breathtaking. The scale to this movie is truly amazing, with multiple sequences throughout the film being completely thrilling and spectacular. Nolan used every dollar from that gargantuan 205 million dollar budget with great care. With Tenet, Nolan once again proves he is one of the most daring, bold, and ambitious filmmakers working today. However, that doesn't make a film great... and Tenet is no exception. It's good, it kept my attention, but as a whole it felt a bit detached. This is an issue I've had with many Nolan films, but with Tenet I would say it's Nolan's biggest offender of lack of authentic emotion. This is all down to the thinly written characters and the unavoidably small amount you care for them. While the performances are all solid, the characters aren't given that many unique traits about them. The main character is simply called ""The Protagonist"" and it is ironically fitting for a character who's only purpose is to seemingly be the ""good guy."" He doesn't even get a proper introduction. I guess if I had to describe him, he is sort of a James Bond esque type, but that's not too original anyways. John David Washington does just about the best he can with the material, but unfortunately that just isn't that much. Robert Pattison's character ""Neil"" is also not given much complexity, but his character is a bit more memorable in my opinion, but maybe that's just down to Pattinson's natural charm. The only character you really feel emotionally attached to is ""Kat"" played by Elizabeth Debicki. However, I think this is probably more down to the sympathetic events surrounding her. I will say that the villain played by Kenneth Branagh is likely the most memorable character just due to the pure ferocity Branagh brings to the screen here. His ambitions do border on, for lack of a better word, cartoonish though. Now to be clear, I don't hate these characters... I just feel no attachment to them. This lack of strong character development makes the movie somewhat emotionless. The film also doesn't always execute exposition very successfully as Tenet is a lot of the time, unnecessarily hard to follow and convoluted. The film would be a lot more investing if Nolan would allow the audience to be let into the basics of the plot. Sometimes this works to great effect however, as Tenet's many audacious reveals are simply brilliant. All in all though, I enjoyed Tenet. I was constantly stunned by the incredible film-making and scale. Even if the character's weren't great, the complete complexity and ambition of the plot begs for a second watch. Tenet is a new experience and a stunning and boldly unique ride, even for its glaring flaws. I will probably watch it again one day, and it might be one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it (like a lot of Nolan's movies). Will those fundamental flaws disappear on a second watch however? Probably not. Tenet is a hard movie to review, because there is truly a lot of amazing things within this movie and it is a unique, audacious experience.... but there is also a lot of things to roll your eyes at as well.

1447,a24wang,"Unprecedented, Complex Movie",10,26 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan has done it again.
Going in, I was afraid that this film might've lost its Christopher Nolan ""touch"" (especially after seeing some disappointed reviews), but every single thing felt unbelievably like Nolan, and I have no doubt when I say that absolutely no one but him would've been able to pull something like this off.
The only shortfall this movie has (in my opinion), is that, unlike Inception, the viewer gets very few explanations about what is actually happening and is dropped into this world without getting more details. Details that are unfortunately crucial to understanding, and most importantly, enjoying a movie. I'd consider myself a nolan fan, so there's some bias on my side as to why nolan withheld explanations and as to why he decided that this was the way this concept and script were to be made into a film. Iwas initially afraid that Nolan might've gone over the top with this movie (mostly in terms of action sequences), but now I feel like he's gone a little over the top with the complexity and especially the lack of explanation of a film. Although there's nothing better than a movie that keeps you thinking about it for days (like this one most probably will), I needed a bit more understandable explanations to nudge me to a possible interpretation. As a consequence, I wish there had been more dialogues, and especially more dialogues that would've felt relevant and important to the story. The soundtrack didn't disappoint me, but it also didn't stand out to me as much as the soundtracks in other Nolan films. Ludwig Göranssom used a certain theme a few times, and it was the exact same theme used in the trailer and other promotional material, so it kind of felt a little overplayed to me. Nonetheless, the soundtrack was amazing in that it added incredible tension and almost another dimension to an already infinitely complicated movie.
Nevertheless, like I mentioned, this movie couldn't possibly feel more like a Christopher Nolan project; the script, cinematography, editing and performances were (as always) impeccable.
All in all, an incredible movie with an even more incredible and unprecedented concept, which unfortunately also became its very little, but unignorable flaw.",Tenet

However, not quite halfway throught the movie, we were looking at each other and considering walking out of the theater. My wife and kids wanted to leave, but I was hoping it would get better, so I talked them into staying. Unfortunately, the movie didn't get much better.Tenet does have some decent special effects peppered here and there, but it is also loaded down with long periods of people just sitting around and talking, which got kind of boring.If you like lots of flashbacks, and people sitting around theorizing about theories of cause and effect, time travel and such, then this might be your cup of tea. However, the whole movie came across like a boring college lecture from a professor who has trouble conveying his ideas. On a certain level, it seemed like an art film trying to be an action movie. Ultimately, I feel like the writer or director failed in his duties to help us relate to the characters, because by the end of the movie I really didn't care about any of them.If you're interested in an ENJOYABLE time travel movie, I would highly recommend an alternative: watching 2012's ""Safety Not Guaranteed"".

Ok, props Nolando!The action really serves no point in this movie because in a movie, backwards is still forwards, so the cleverness rests in something you are told, not shown. Your will struggle with trying to reconcile the visualization with what you are told. This sensation may feel deep. But it also leads to the paradox of an action movie that only makes sense when it is explained by its characters. Helpful to watch with subtitles due to bad sound and JDW slurring his speech. Once you get the clever gimmick you may become aware that the effects upon which this movie depends are not really playful like a good magic act, but sort of forced and tedious. As important as the idea of time slips are to Nolando, it seems he just writes about them as a sort of wish fulfillment that he could reverse his own career and be a family man.This story is dramatically very lopsided and emotionally vacant, like Dunkirk, due to AWOL Jon Nolan -- who is the smarter brother -- and Chris' reliance on set pieces which at best are absurd and have nothing at stake.In spite of these criticisms, I enjoyed being beaten over the head by this production more than I expected I would.This is not anywhere close a masterpiece.

1458,tyrionschrute,Not as good as other Christopher Nolan Movie ...,7,25 January 2021,Tenet is a very complicated movie with only 2 and a half hour to explain it . What I feel about this movie is that this movie has no heart or feeling in it . What I mean is that the purpose of this movie is only to make you feel dumb ( if you dont understand it ) not to entertain you . And also this movie is so LOUD .

1459,justinlong-28052,This movie is BAD,1,3 December 2020,"For one reason: it makes no sense. You will be sitting there wondering: ""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Why?"" ""What just happened?"" And even if you spend the whole day trying to sort out the plot, it won't make any sense. The writer/director/auteur Christopher Nolan's singular style is Go Big Or Go Home. He takes a big budget, a big cast of characters (note I said 'characters' not 'stars') and then he tries, actually tries, to make the story as convoluted as possible. Just so he can justify the huge budget, special effects, fancy camera work and arguably big cast. It's good this movie played in theatres during the Great Pandemic; less people will have paid (wasted) good money to see it and now they can see it for free via streaming. There are so many movies that tell a reasonably good story and are easy to understand. Yet those movies don't get much credit. Too bad.This movie lets you travel the globe and visit some exotic locales (Mumbai, right? where some fabulously wealthy arms dealer has his fortress apartment right across the street from a ghetto market) such as the Ukraine where the opera house is designed like a football stadium. I guess in the Ukraine, there are as many opera-lovers as America has football fans.Nolan needs to get his head out of his video game and go see the real world. Please don't give this man another penny if he's going to film his own script. And don't waste your time trying to sort out the bits and pieces that make up this movie. Because any logic you can make of it, will still be full of holes.",Tenet

1461,connorchatterjee,Review of tenet,7,21 May 2021,"2/2 personal/plot - enjoyed the confusion and resolution at the end. 2/2 cinematography- beautiful cinematography, typical Nolan creation.1/2 spiritual/ending- Would have been cool if the man who sacrifices had been the son of the mother. In the mother's fight for her son, could see different themes, but ultimately after watching the movie, I only had one idea that impacted me. Which was an idea brought up by the protagonist, that each generation only looks out for themselves. This was the reason for the possible end of humanity, and was extremely interesting, but not spiritually relevant. Acting- mainly good so 1/1.Score and music could have been better, use to Hanz Zimmer in Nolan films, with beautiful scores that perfectly match the scene. Here, did not feel that the presence of music did anything powerful to make the scene come to life. So 0/1. I would recommend it, but not rewatch it. So 0.5/1. And the pacing of the film was relatively slow and not well paced in the beginning as opposed to the end so 0.5/1 as well.Total= 7/10.",Tenet

A simple search on Googe for understanding dialogie in tenet shows that I am far from alone. With so much money and such great technology how do you produce a film that few will understand. If ever we need exposition from dialogue this is it. So I am left with a murky idea of what it's about and I guess I have to wait until it shows up in some other form so I can see subtitles.

I can understand why even critics are not on board with this one as it never gives enough time nor possible explanation to the audiences to fully immerse in the experience and Appreciate the beauty of it all. I have watched it twice as of now and can say with confidence that this is his best work since Inception. Not only he plays with time here as we saw in The Interstellar (2014) but creates a new ground of reality altogether. A lot of exposition thrown at you with a whole lot of Jargons to follow which are explained so fast that you can't even blink your eye and I am serious ( so much for Tight editing 😁).
The film is visually a treat and as we all know Mr. Nolan has a habit of using Real props and strict NO for CGI, the end result is just mesmerizing. The scenes shot in Mumbai with Dimple Kapadia's Priya are just pure fun and captivating. In short you need to feel it rather understand it (It literally tells you in the beginning of the film).
Even Narcissistic men can't possibly decode this unsolvable possible in one go let alone the others.
The soundtrack is not by Hans Zimmer this time due to some Pre scheduled work, but Mr. Ludwig Göransson is simply apt for the movie and adds to the already tension filled environment with a penace.
John David Washington and Robert Pattinson both have done some extraordinary work both mentally and physically doing their own stunts and whatnot.
I promise you this, you haven't seen anything like this before even if Don't understand everything at once 😂. But once you do, you will not be able to stop gloating about it. See for yourself in an IMAX theatre near you for a enriched experience.VERDICT: 4.5/5",Tenet

Nolan doesn't hold your hand guiding you through origins or making sure you won't get lost, the movie happens at its own pace and its the viewers job to keep up with the train of thought.Shout out to John David Washington who feels more like a human being than ""a man with a mission"" type of character, something that has always been missing on Nolan's movies.This is the type of movie for people who likes a challenge, regardless of how many times you'll need to watch it to fully understand the plot.",Tenet

One can't help but wonder throughout the lengthy film if the lack of explanation is a means to hide a lack of depth, and even a lack of almost any story at all.SPOILER WARNING: The movie is basically this, a man discovers that certain nuclear reactions cause objects to reverse in time. Then we get introduced to people who happened to be the ones who encountered the radioactive material, and they've been receiving gold shipments from themselves in the future. We never learn anything more. We know that the main character decides to use the nuclear material to go backwards in time, and continues to go back further at the end of the movie. And Robert Pattinson tells us that they met a long time ago in the past, and they got into some stuff, and they're best friends, but we don't actually get to see any of that, we're just told it happened.The entire movie is just basically watching this incredibly simple plot unfold. They hide the plot behind having to break in here, an army fights there, there's an art dealer who knows more here, and so on, but it doesn't actually add to the plot.",Tenet
1471,mk1705,Very underwhelming (for a Christopher Nolan movie),3,4 September 2020,"The film claims a great deal without providing the evidence or ensuring that the claimed relationships and scenarios are actually transmitted to the audience. It claims that the world is in danger, but at no point does this danger come across. It is claimed that the main actor and the wife of the evil Russian develops a relationship without showing that a relationship is developing.
All the time I was sitting in the cinema and thought: ""This is it? This is a Nolan film! And that's all he could think of? We see action sequences forward, and then just the same sequence a little later backwards?
The film had little or no emotional content (which was exactly Nolan's strength - the perfect balance between story and great cinema). With impressive action, they tried to distract the audience from the lack of dramaturgy, boring one-dimensional characters and conflict-free explanatory scenes.Acting:
Washington's son didn't earn the role, he got it for political reasons, because he is Washington's son. He can't wear this film at any time, can't deliver the sets properly, has 0 charisma and 0 charisma. A son who is simply given a leading role by his father's connections has never been a good idea. His performance is disappointing, an insult to all the other great actors who could have done it miles better but who don't have a famous father.
Basically the cast is disappointing in general. I don't know if the shooting conditions for this movie were difficult, but sometimes it seems as if the actors didn't understand the script or the movie itself 100%. They seem a bit lost. With the script that looked more like a big mess, this is not surprising. I didn't find anyone outstanding and was disappointed with the performances all round.This film has an impressive directing and great action scenes. But that alone does not make a good film and does not excuse a flawed dramaturgy.
My rating is so negative because I expect much more from Nolan than an 0815 action spy movie a la James Bond. I was thrilled by Prestige, in awe at Inception and Interstellar I have seen it in the cinema several times. We had interesting relationship dynamics in the other films between father and daughter, husband and ex-wife or two rivals who fight each other because the great love dies in a magic trick.And now we have a second Jaden Smith, who in the beginning risks his life for his mission, but in the end risks saving the world because of the Russian's wife, with whom he has nothing else to do except exchanging cool sayings.Very disappointing.",Tenet

None of it, none of it, makes sense. People walk into rooms backwards and spout utter sci-fi nonsense then partially un-fight each other while not having previously had any ill effects, therefore meaning that the fight was perfectly harmless and therefore pointless.
Random characters appear then disappear without a trace, while the main protagonist wanders around like he's having to actively force his way through the air then mumbles something which has absolutely nothing to do with the situation.

It's a shallow, empty, narcissist piece of film making with blatant disregard for those who are giving up 150 minutes of their time to see it. What makes matters worse is that Nolan's last movie, Dunkirk was a masterpiece.Clearly I'm foolish as I had no idea what was going on throughout. I'm also not sure I'm supposed to. Call me old fashioned but I like a movie with either some semblance of plot or characterisation. There's no empathy here. You will not care about anyone or anything on screen.Then there's the sound. I watched this in imax. The music shook the speakers to the point where they were trembling. But could I hear anything the actors were saying? Of course not. They were buried beneath an avalanche of noise. Great swathes of dialogue remain unheard.As the movie lurches towards its third and abysmal final act and you're forced to watch a third rate version of call on duty intercut with a woman pouring suntan lotion on someone's back, you begin to wish that you could move backwards in time and claim back those 150 minutes of time that you've wasted watching this dross.In a time when we deserve great escapist entertainment, Tenet is a travesty.

1497,Akaanksh,Rushed and Disappointing,7,21 December 2020,"Innovative yet uninteresting, creative yet bland, Christopher Nolan's over-hyped Tenet is a rather lacklustre entry into the director's nigh on perfect filmography. The movie features John David Washington (BlacKkKlansman), Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby) and the great Kenneth Branagh in the lead roles. While the actors were fantastic, their characters were too simplistic to be invested in. Nolan focused too much on developing a complex plot when his characters required a level of complexity. The only adequately written character was the villain Andrei Sator, and Kenneth Branagh delivered an exceptional performance as Sator. John David Washington brings a spy thriller's charisma in the typical protagonist, while Elizabeth Debicki gives a convincingly good performance as the ""damsel-in-distress"". As for Robert Pattinson, if The Lighthouse didn't do it, Tenet definitely helped him convince the world that he's more than just the ""Twilight guy"". Pattinson shared great chemistry with J. D. Washington, and this bonding between the two adds weight to an emotional punch at the climax of the movie. However, Pattinson's calibre actor deserved a far meatier role than what he ended up with.The dialogues, in a classic Nolan style, are laden with exposition with zero substance. This time the dialogues are even worse than usual. To add to that, the sound mixing was so awful and loud that it was hard to hear anything the characters ever spoke cause, for some reason, the sound of the ocean waves are more important than two pivotal characters having a meaningful exchange. On the other hand, Ludwig Göransson's original score is as sweet as honey to the ears. I'm not saying that the movie is terrible because the plot is unnecessarily too complex to comprehend. Other Nolan movies like The Prestige and Inception had confusing plots, but they also had compelling characters and actual conflict. The conflict between Andrei Sator and ""The Protagonist"" is nothing compared to the conflict between Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Nolan's other works, while confusing, are easy to get a gist of, while Tenet sounds meaningless. One might say that Tenet requires a higher attention span, but no, Tenet is pretentious and tries to appear intelligent when it is not.Another problem is the lack of mystery as opposed to other Nolan movies. While the main plot keeps developing, there was always a particular mystery, a hidden secret or knowledge that drives the characters forward, and that is sorely missing here. Also, the plot twists were so apparent that it's hard not to see them coming. The action sequences were impressive, and that alone might be a reason enough to watch this movie on the big screen. Watching a crashed car revert back to normality with a thumping background score is a truly exhilarating experience which only a theatre can give you. If you're okay with missing out on this, it is suggested to rather stay at home and watch Tenet when it drops onto HBO Max.In conclusion, Tenet isn't even close to being a ""must-watch"" film, but that doesn't mean it is terrible. It's disappointing. It has its own ups to equal the downs. However, it does feel rushed with its fast-paced narrative, and I would love to watch a version of this movie where Nolan spent an additional year developing the script. If you want to watch a better film, I highly recommend Nolan's underrated masterpiece The Prestige, which is arguably his best film to date.",Tenet
1498,sachin-73003,NOLANISMS(Very Mild Spoilers),6,1 June 2021,"Tenet is a film which is hard to judge by the conventional norms of screen writing and fundamentals of storytelling. It takes the bold step of challenging these rules and bends reality and perspectives in this action-espionage- thriller time travelling, high concept, fictious film.But Nolan has already challenged and successfully changed these norms that pertain to storytelling via Following, Insomnia, Memento, Inception, Prestige showing that non- linear and cerebral storytelling can be as compelling as The Avengers.While Interstellar and Dunkirk may not have been everyone's favorite, they still had enough ambition and meat to gain success and everyone's familiar with his dark knight trilogy.So now what does Tenet bring?Sadly nothing extraordinary. On a pure technical level, it achieves and goes where films and blockbusters neither tend to nor have the capacity to,
resulting in some inventive set pieces that probably only Nolan can have the ambition and skill to stage and execute.And that's it. There's nothing more to this film, the score is phenomenal filling each scene with a lot of energy, it's well shot as expected, but nothing more.When your protagonist is called the PROTAGONIST then I think that sets you up for something.Some action scenes as I said are ambitious but do all of them live up to the billing?Having seen this film twice(once in a theatre and then on prime), the car chase scene where there are reverse and forward moving cars all involved in a chase is poorly done(Just My Opinion!).With most cars barely visible because of the shoddy camera work, resulting in an ambitious yet underwhelming action sequence where you are left feeling that maybe you missed something? It could have been better perhaps!Or maybe that's the extent to which Nolan could have done?The finale with inverted and forward people in temporal motion is crazy and yet undermined by the constant inter cutting with other scenes and once again you are left underwhelmed with.The hallway scene is the one where truly the fight scenes shine with some great and well thought out choreography, while for some it might become too goofy to take it seriously but for me it worked.The plot is the same as many of the blockbusters Hollywood has churned out, but the screenplay is where Nolan experiments again with a higher sense of self indulgence than ever.The editing goes from clunky to frustrating, rendering the pace too uneven.Some scenes are chopped and editing hastily to keep the film going and some just take their own sweet time while revealing next to nothing about the plot and more importantly the characters.It's probably impossible for me to break everything down, overall I could conclude that Tenet is an ambitious film on all levels with an emphasis on the technical side a little more than on the characters.One can call this an ambitious experiment to see what fits and what doesn't,
sadly I don't think Tenet goes all the way and achieves what it sets out to
and crumbles under it's own overly complicated and dense world of rules and time inversion it creates, resulting in a mind boggling and fascinating and yet somehow an underwhelming film that one can still admire and revisit purely for the effort and ambition that Christopher Nolan had and poured into this film.",Tenet

Something was lacking though in both the story and the characters - I didn't find it confusing but I just found myself not really caring about either. This film just didn't engage me and draw me in.Also, as others have said the sound is terrible in this film. Nolan's Batman films, Inception and Interstellar all have great soundtracks. The music in Tenet is really bad but also it and the ambient sounds at times completely drown out the dialogue meaning you have no idea what the characters are saying.Disappointing and definitely Nolan's worst film and by a big margin.",Tenet

But hot damn, he creates entertaining films, even if you aren't quite sure WTF is going on. But around my 7th view of Tenet, it pieced together like.... Tenet.All I can say/recommend, is listen to everything Andrei Sator says, and follow Robert Pattinson's character/dialogue just as closely. They are everything to the deeper meaning of Tenet. JD Washington flat out murders his role, but its easy to follow 'the protagonist'...

1506,seedoeatreview,Looks pretty but its a confusing jumbled mess. Should be called FIVE-ET!,5,11 September 2020,"One of my great joys is walking into a cinema excited with anticipation for a movie that I've been waiting months to see. Christopher Nolan has won world-wide acclaim as a director for the Batman trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk so it's fair to say that Hollywood would allow him to make anything he'd like at the moment, and that's where Tenet comes in. Written by Nolan it's a look at the world through futuristic eyes, much like Inception, and, if you've seen the preview, gives off some seriously weird vibes from the use of its special effects to explain time travel. Moviegoers have had to wait a long time to see this film (being delayed due to the covid crisis) but the wait is finally over and Hollywood's first big blockbuster post-covid release is here. But does it live up to all the hype?In its entire two hour and thirty minute running time Tenet doesn't give us actor John David Washington's name in the film, he is simply known as The Protagonist - a Special Forces type undercover operative in the mould of James Bond but without the digits. His mission, much like Bond's, is to save the world from total annihilation. It seems as if the villainous Russian known as Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) has found a way to travel back and forth through time and will bring about Earth's demise if he isn't stopped. Making matters worse for The Protagonist is Sator's wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). Being held captive in a loveless marriage she's willing to help him get close to Sator but only if she can get what she wants in return, to escape with her son. With such big stakes at play can the Protagonist succeed in his mission as well as play hero to an abused wife? With time travel involved anything seems possible as this literal race against time twists, turns and reverses to its ineluctable ?? conclusion.THE GOOD
With a budget of $205 million dollars you can rest assured the Nolan has made this movie look as beautiful as any film that has come before it. From the huge sweeping landscapes to the rough and tumble of the ships in the ocean, no expense was spared in the making of this film and the intense action and amazing special effects will blow your mind. Not one green screen was used throughout the film's shooting as Nolan wanted to give the movie a real-life feel. So when you see a 747 plane crash, it is actually a 747 plane crashing. The filmmaker's purchased a plane with the intent to crash it instead of using computer generated special effects to do the job. That's dedication to the craft right there!
As for the actors, John David Washington is good in any role but surprisingly it was Robert Pattinson, playing scientist/engineer/undercover agent Neil, who really won me over. I don't think he's ever made a film which I've really enjoyed (his films just aren't for my tastes) but with this performance (plus I've just seen his trailer for the new Batman film) he definitely has a fan in me.THE BAD
Where to start? Nothing is more frustrating as an audience member than being made to feel like an idiot by a director who is quite blatantly trying to show you that he is the smartest guy in the room. Tenet will make you feel like an idiot. And it's not in the ""I don't know what's happening but I'll find out by the end of the film"" way but more in the ""I don't know what happened and it's three days later and I still don't know what happened"" way. This film is the equivalent of someone telling you they know a secret but they can't tell you what it is. Then they come back 15 minutes later and say the same thing again. Now picture this going on for two and a half hours and this is how I felt walking out of Tenet. I even saw three people in my screening get up and leave the cinema halfway through the movie, never to return. I can completely understand how those people felt because it's at about the halfway mark that you realise Nolan isn't going to give you any answers. The time travel is what it is, the actors all talk really smarmy and really fast, like they're cops in an episode of Law & Order, and the audience is left looking at all the pretty pictures on the screen having no idea what is actually happening. I thought rule one of film making was not to make your audience feel stupid!THE UGLY
I think my movie buddy Lanie put it best when, 20 minutes after the film had finished, she mentioned ""I don't think I've ever seen you so angry after watching a film before!"" I responded ""Well A) you never saw me after Batman/Superman: Dawn of Justice (I was so irate I had to go home and lie down for two hours) and B) I don't enjoy watching films like Tenet where the whole audience is meant to clap and cheer for a movie made by a brilliant director all because he is a brilliant director."" This film is a two and half hour precocious, self-centred, egotistical, conceited mess that I never expected but had really high hopes for but which never came close to fulfilling. And thus my anger still burns!So what do you give a film that looks remarkable, has some truly amazing scenes and fantastic acting from the likes of Pattinson and Debicki but makes zero sense to anybody once the end credits roll?",Tenet
1507,amwriter,So wanted to like it but,3,26 October 2020,"It just wasn't up to par on the first viewing. Not sure who is rating this film as high as 9 or 10.I will give it a second chance in the future, but on first viewing I won't be recommending it. The lead character didn't seem like he fit into the role well, Denzel would've done it so well or Idris Alba. That mother who kept having to remind us she had a son (we only glimpsed) wasn't particularly convincing either. Patterson did well though! Branagh was good as a villain, if a tad cliche and shallow. Generally, who ever casted this was on something.The plot was way to convoluted. It took too much effort to understand the back and forth time frames, inverted time is what they called it. Felt gimmicky.Great action scenes, and good photography though.",Tenet

I'm not sure whether I understood every aspect of the story but now, 3 explanation videos on YouTube later, I'm a little bit smarter and probably I have to see it twice. Another reason for having difficulties to decipher it is that the sound mixing is terrible. The actors are partially hard to understand and the score is way too loud. The volume was like on a techno clubbing. This is going to be fun when people are watching it at home on TV. Last but not least I didn't like that in the end it is like a war movie. I hate that.

1510,siggirules,"If a movie requires multiple viewings, it disrespects the audience!",5,31 August 2020,"Memento, The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar had something in common (besides being Christopher Nolan movies), they demanded and appreciated an attentive audience, paying attention to every second on the screen and they rewarded multiple viewings with added detail and hidden puzzle pieces.Tenet differs from those great movies in one regard, it doesn't try to bring an engaged audience along, it tries to outsmart it in a way that comes of slightly arrogant. It doesn't only reward multiple viewings it requires them. And this I have to hold against the movie.Cinematography, acting, soundtrack and set pieces are all spectacular, as expected, the sound-mix on the other hand is following Interstellar in that the voices are relatively muted against the soundtrack and the soundscape. This movie is 100% plot driven and it is essential to listen to every word said, but often the movie makes it intentionally hard to understand the characters. There is a scene with 3 people sailing on boat while negotiating a deal, I did not understand a word that was said there. There is also a major turn in the story midway to the movie where the protagonist has to make a tough decision under pressure and a lot of new characters appear arguing for and against the next cause of action. This scene contains significant amounts of information on how this world works, yet it is incredibly hard to follow since people are talking over each other and it is not even clear on who is talking all the time.I walked out of the theater unsatisfied, while I think I got most of it, there is a major plot point that doesn't make sense to me. Yes, a lot of people say it's better on second viewing and I will watch it again when it hits VOD one day, but not in theaters (especially during pandemic) and maybe it will be better. The way it stands it comes of as disrespectful for the audience.",Tenet
1511,utblucand,Up as a masterpiece with both interstellar and inception,10,27 August 2020,"Nolan directed bars a high, after both interstellar and inceptio. Despite that bar this film was over it. I though it was a phenomenal film, both script, actors and alla categories. It was a perfect movie for Pattison to show his new start in acting, he really shined in this movie.When you talk about the movie, everything work perfect. Action scenes amazing songs and themes.At the end you learn alot of parts through out thd movie. How the protagonist was the mind behind it, but his future self sent back neil to help him past time. Still there are so many questions, thats the classic Nolan film, where you really need to work you brain. That's why you really need to see the movie atleast 2 times before really getting the best feeling, still its a 10/10 for me.I recommend everyone to go see itPersonally my two favorite scene was where the protagonist fought a man in revert.

1513,zenmilos,"from ""iQ-filmovi"" at blogspot",3,14 September 2020,"There's nothing worse than commenting on movies we don't like. But the latest mess with palindromic title with of so-called renowned director Christopher Nolan does not deserve to be simply ignored. It deserves at least a few remarks, in order not to be forgotten.If it took years for someone to write about such a scenario, full of inconsistencies and holes, each of which is bigger than the poorly interpreted idea, it would be wiser to ask e.g. a graduate physicist, who has not spent so many years in vain, to clarify to him the concepts of entropy, the arrow of time, the theory of cause-and-effect relations in quantum mechanics, and so on. But even if we ignore all that, every movie is a fantasy, including excellent ""Inception"", at least consistent, if nothing else, then to itself, unlike this one, which at the very beginning in one scene prescribes ""in order to pick up a reverse entropic bullet, you must first drop it"", so in the next scene it is no longer valid, and so on until the end of the film.The acting is, sadly, also a failure, but here I don't include the main Protagonist, who didn't deserve so far at all to be called an actor. But with such an unfortunate story and such assigned stereotypical characters, there was probably no room for such a thing.In addition to the fact that, when Hollywood no longer knows what kind of car chase to shoot, all that remains is to picture chase in reverse, this film seems to follow the latest concept according to which the most meaningless plot should be messed up, hollow dialogues should be recorded so that they are heard and understood as little as possible (including a few spoken sentences over eating a food of guest star Michael Caine), lest the gullible audience think there was something else to see (and to hear), and that some would be fooled into watching this film again, hoping in vain that something s/he may have missed.In short, a shameful attempt to make another action James Bond film with a few sci-fi elements for the pretentious viewers who will not regret watching the film over and over again, trying to ""understand"" it. It's just that every James Bond's movie is far more interesting than this.As someone has already mentioned, yes, it may be looked at once again, but backwards, if only they return the money for the ticket at the end at the box office, and no other way 👎",Tenet

No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic ""Tenet"" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task.

1526,matris1,An entertaining and original film hampered by lacklustre sound mixing and zero charisma,7,7 March 2021,"Whilst the plot is convoluted, overall this is a wholly entertaining and original film. I am not lowering the score due to the perplexing story-thread. It's true that if you go in with no prior knowledge it'll probably take 2-3 viewings to (mostly) understand what the heck is going on. But it is all there on screen, you just have to pay attention. Which is typical for a Nolan film, and for that it's absolutely enjoyable. What makes this film not as great as your typical Nolan outing is as follows...First, the sound mixing. Nolan has been pinned for his sound before, well it's here again and there's a reason a lot of people are complaining about it. Some of the dialogue is barely audible, with some reviewers stating they needed subtitles just to hear what the actors are saying. Then you have your staple Nolan, orchestral boom, that is overused to a fault. Nolan has said that he's very particular about his sound mixing, and I tried to take this into account, e.g. you probably wouldn't hear what people are saying all the time given the situations they are in. However, this isn't real-life, it's a film, and you can't ask ""what the heck did you just say"". So you may miss what's said in one scene, and then be deafened by an orchestra horn in the next.The main problem however, comes from the films utter lack of charisma. It's easier to show than tell, but I'll try my best with some examples:
The main character doesn't even have a name. Just a label, the 'protagonist'. This treatment of the central character flows through to his motives and actions. i.e. He's like a walking MacGuffin.The entire film is filled with (what I call) 'destination dialogue', i.e. dialogue and conversations which simply exist to move the characters to the next scene. Often, this type of dialogue can be a good thing as it helps propel the movie/story forward. However, when the entire movie only contains this type of speaking, it loses all sense of charisma, vernacular and personality.The characters barely have any 'natural' conversations throughout the entire film. Using a contrasting film to explain, some of Tarantino's best scenes in his movies are when the characters are simply engaging in natural dialogue (albeit with the twist of the setting to add flair). Tenet, is the exact opposite of this.Side note: the most entertaining character was Robert Pattison's. He was quite good, actually.In summary, it's an entertaining and complex film with some inventive action and creative use of time-bending logic. The fact that it's basically comprehendable the first viewing (from a plot perspective) is a marvel in itself. The film is quite good as a whole and definitely deserves to be seen.

It feels like Nolan's pursuit of making overly complicated plots have gone beyond audience understanding.The antagonist's motivation was too weak.

1534,shujayk,Freewill!!!!!!!!!!,10,17 December 2020,"TENET MOVIE REVIEW
""Time is an encoded pattern of fabric woven with information & energy.' (Interstellar Movie)
Time and Space has been quite an interesting topic . Hollywood has dared to make really epic movies on time. Starting from Back to the future to Interstellar , and the latest edition is TENET.
Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight Rises, Inception , Interstellar Christoper Nolen stands out as one of the most prominent movie director. After I saw Inception I thought it was the ultimate movie ever made I entire history of Hollywood, I was wring till I saw Interstellar and I was again wrong till I saw TENET.
Nolan has always surprised and again hits the bulls eye. The movie is based on the theory of Time Inversion. The theory states , the ability to reverse entropy is what causes ""time inversion."" When you are inverted, you move backwards in time. From your perception, you are moving as normal, while the rest of the world is moving in reverse. Essentially, we are watching the inverted object on rewind (like a puddle of milk becoming ice cream) while the rest of the world moves as normal, in a linear, forward motion. For us, cause is followed by effect, but for inverted objects, it's reversed. We see the effect (a bullet hole in a wall), but the cause hasn't happened yet (a gun shooting that bullet into the wall).Complicated Yes it is , Christopher Nolan always come up with an unique ideas which shakes you and raises some serious questions about the existence and understanding of the reality.
Dialogues from the movie
Reality?
But can we change things? If we do it differently...?
What's happened's happened. Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world, not an excuse to do nothing.
Fate?
Call it what you want.
What do you call it?
Reality.
What about free will, you ask? As Clémence Poésy's character explains early in the film, catching a reverse bullet only happens because you willed it. A reverse bullet hole is only ""caught"" (or ""fired"" in reverse) if the person handling the gun makes themselves catch or fire it. Sure, we get into weirder territory further into the story once we get into the grandfather paradox and whether the chicken came before the egg, but the general idea remains: everything that happens was decided by characters acting out of their own free will, even if they don't fully realize it just yet.
The Tenet is based on 3 time dimensions of past and future, and the moment when the forward and backward moment collides. The last mission in the movie is based on same concept. From the perspective of the inverted, they arrive at the battlefield at the end, and work their way backwards, seeing how everything plays out. Then they arrive at the beginning of the battle, re-invert themselves, and inform the other half about what's coming to make sure they can succeed. Both sides then see people seemingly heal from wounds or even return from the dead, because it hasn't happened yet from their perspective. Once we see things play out from the other team's perspective, we see how it all goes down.
Both forward and backward loops have loose ends and this is the job of the Main character played by John David Washington, to make sure that the loose ends are tighten by using freewill. If freewill can be so strong it changes the entire reality or there is no reality perhaps.......!!!!!!!!",Tenet

1536,mstv-126-623348,Falls simply Flat,2,9 January 2021,"This movie is an orphan. It lacks identity. I surmise that it tries to be a sophisticated sort of James Bond movie with a science fiction twist. I was trying hard to figure out what this film is: is it a horror movie? Is it an action adventure movie? Is it a suspense or thriller? Is it a science fiction? Well, it fails to be any of the above. There was too much fast talking to be a deep thriller. There was too much violence to be a suspense or science fiction. Finally , the actors fail to deliver-with the exception of brilliant Elizabeth Debicki.

It looks like prequel of a main movie to come. It is the worst Nolan movie. You will loose nothing if you don't watch it. It seems premature and unfinished. I'm sure Nolan is also not proud of his work. It could have been much better.,Tenet
1542,switchboard85,Another Instant Classic From Christopher Nolan,9,10 September 2020,"""Tenet"" wraps so many of the skills that Christopher Nolan has honed over his previous 10 films and puts them on high display. Like so many of his movies, this is a very plot-heavy story with a lot of exposition. Normally, an overuse of exposition irks me more than most things, but in films like ""The Prestige"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" and ""Tenet"", it somehow feels not only appropriate but absolutely necessary. The only thing that type of dialogue tends to hurt is the characterization through much of the runtime. By the end of the story, we are given ample character motivation and dimension, which may make this an even better watch on a second viewing.Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that is nearly impossible to talk about without spoiling it.",Tenet
1543,danpickard,Brilliant creativity,9,18 January 2021,"It's a real breath of fresh air when people come up with a completely new concept. When I heard Nolan was making a film that involved time travel I was obviously super curious. And he delivered!
I only gave this a 9 out of 10 for a few reasons. I thought the first hour or so of the film was utterly boring, also with too much pointless violence, and I nearly gave up on it. The excitement of the film is centered around the few times that they actually pass through an inverter. But man is it worth the wait!
I could also point out a hundred flaws in the film but overall, a really really good attempt and stretching the boundaries of time. Inspirational film making",Tenet

1545,BerkayKuscu,Do you see the narcissism of this movie?,5,23 October 2021,"Nolan is a genius without a doubt and he proves it again and again with all his movies. However, I perceived this movie as a step further in the sense that he does not want to prove himself but rather expect us to respect and give more appreciation to his genius.How many times did you feel lost during the movie? How many times you were searching for an answer to what has just happened? How many times did you have to watch to understand the whole plot? Inception was a very complicated masterpiece but it was understandable. Interstellar was crazy but based on an understandable and meaningful plot. This movie is directed on purpose to be overcomplicated and obscure. This movie wants to be rewatched again and again until you get all the answers from really small details.Throughout the movie, I felt like Nolan was testing my intelligence and wishing me to fail by giving explanations that does not make sense until the very end of the movie. I felt like he wanted me to get lost and just appreciate that he is the creator of this complex paradoxical narrative.I don't like it. I don't want to be belittled by a movie and I will definitely not spend my time to understand his genius. This movie has serious problems in terms of communicating with the audience.",Tenet
1546,habylab,"Great idea, poor execution",7,31 August 2020,"The concept in this film without giving anything away is really interesting and fascinating to watch. But for me the way it unfolds is a bit like reading a revelation in a book you're not sure is a big deal, flicking back through the pages, and realising it is. As it's a film you have to unpack any big moment while the scene continues. It's a spectacle at times but for me the action sequences aren't as spectacular as any other recent Nolan film, which does let it down a bit. Performances are great and the soundtrack is fascinating, but the characters are a little thin and there isn't that much of a plot going on really that makes sense to drive the plot forward in a natural way.",Tenet

But when you have to obtain a doctors degree in physics to keep up, something is dead wrong. Sure, there are some great action sequences in it and to Nolans big credit there are few or if any green screens or cgi.
So thats cool. But the story and the time line?! Jeee suuuuzzzz. There is a lot of talk now about corona and cinema, and this movie was suppose to bring people back to theaters and because it didn't there is no use of trying. That annoys me! Tenet is just to damn complicated for a broad audience to comprehend. Nolan is a great movie maker no doubt.

On the emotional level, the film moves rather moderately, but it is captivating. I liked also the convincing acting.

Branagh totally sells it. This is one of the best performances I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. John Washington is the other half of this and does almost as well as 'The Protagonist'.As to the rest of the movie? Well, pretty good. The story and the premise are very complex. It works because we care about the characters and they seem to understand it, even if we don't. Its a movie clearly intended to be watched multiple times and will hopefully get better after each viewing.The effects are really breathtaking and well worth seeing in a theatre.

You really have to watch it at least twice and it is also true that subtitles may help to understand the complex parts, especially when the dialogues involves theories of physics.

The brilliant visuals and new concept of traversing through time is unfortunately overshadowed by a horrific mix of dialogue, music, and sound effects. I'm pretty sure test audiences were not used because if they had been they would have collectively said ""What?"" At least HALF of the dialogue I missed and had to guess what was said. It was about 2/3 into the movie until a quiet two person conversation happened that I actually heard them clearly. I LOVE Christopher Nolan but have never been this frustrated in a film.

1558,IsThatJoseph21,A movie that requires subtitles,7,31 August 2020,"Out of all the movies releasing in 2020, Tenet was my most anticipated. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors. I've enjoyed all of his previous movies except for Following and Insomnia. If I were to pick my favorite Nolan movie, it would definitely be a tie between The Dark Knight and Inception. While Tenet is still a good movie, I would consider it to be one of his lesser ones.My biggest issue with Tenet is the same gripe I had with Interstellar: the dialogue can barely be heard. While watching the movie, I could only understand 10% of the conversations. This made the story very difficult to follow at times. My enjoyment of Tenet would significantly improve once I'm able to watch it at home with subtitles.Besides the audio issues, I thought everything else was good. By far, the best part about Tenet was its action sequences. All of the set pieces were creative and entertaining. If Tenet doesn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects this year, I would be shocked.Overall, Tenet was a decent Nolan movie. It's not as entertaining as The Dark Knight or as emotionally impactful as Inception, but it's still an impressive feat of filmmaking.

The story is clever and far from simple, I assume. And if its exposition could have been laid out in a fashion we could hear and understand, all would have been well. But, alas, it is not.
Mr. Nolan seems to have a fetish for a loud 'thrumming' in the soundtrack's background, which overpowers everything on the screen. This is possibly with a view to increase tension in the viewer. It almost worked, I got a tension headache from being assailed by it. There's plenty of action and car crashes etc. which would have been good if it were known why they were all happening. A second viewing might explain things better, but somehow I doubt it. Even the quiet plot device explanations were unintelligible.

It's definitely passable entertainment.But its director is really, really sly, and being such he managed to convince a lot of people (and especially a lot of critics) out there that he created a very profound and complicated movie, when in fact he did not. 'Cause ""Tenet"" is pretty much a Bond movie going backwards half of the time. The plot is really that simple and predictable - half an hour into it and you'd already grasp pretty much everything there is to grasp. I'm not being arrogant here, please believe me: go watch the movie and you'll realize that yourself. Guaranteed. Now that we have put that aside, I'll go on by laying everything out plain and simple:PROS:Great direction. That's a given: Nolan knows how to put the camera to best use and knows how to keep you hooked most of the time;Effective soundtrack. It's not by any chance memorable, but it nonetheless contributes a lot to the movie's overall atmosphere;Dark cinematography. Again, very effective and in line with the movie' ""serious"" tone;A couple of great action sequences. And the ""backwards special effects"" are really a treat to behold.
CONS:Mediocre dialogues and screenplay. I mean, a lot of times the dialogues are either cringeworthy or purely explanatory (and the bad guy has the worst lines of them all). On top of that, the screenplay tries the best to conceal its simple narrative, but can't quite manage to convince you that it's phenomenal and brilliant, or that in the end it's isn't just a matter of a banal spy story. And - by the way - the overall theme is too close to blatant fatalism for me to like.Cardboard characters. Every single one of them is a total ""spy movie"" cliché: from the ""Protagonist"" to the ridiculous villain. They're completely underdeveloped and so there's no chance that the viewers can indentify with them.Unconvincing main actor. Of course he's isn't on par with his father Denzel - but that's obvious. The problem is that he also isn't on par neither with Pattison nor especially with Branagh. Really a bad casting choice over here.Lack of pathos. You're not gonna feel any empathy towards the characters ('cause, as I said, they're not actually characters: they are puppets, cardboard puppets with no interesting personalities). Nolan himself doesn't seem to care about that, lost as he is in his ""entropy gimmick"".
Here you go. In conclusion - to sum it up - I'd say that ""Tenet"" is definitely a movie to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's a decent blockbuster full of every kind of action and vaguely intriguing in its premise. It's also - however - let down by a predictable storyline and mediocre dialogues. It lacks pathos and presents us with a main actor who is not really that good. But at the very least Nolan with this new movie is trying to do something different from the majority of other big budget productions and we gotta hand it to him. Anyway, his movie isn't by any standard a great one.
That's all I had to say. So long folks, and may the ""Sator square"" be with you!",Tenet
1579,CriticFred,A film like no other,10,28 December 2020,"Where do you begin in a film quite like this. In other words... wow! A film genre that we thought was already largely explored, has just grown wider, in what Nolan keeps pushing and increasing the heights of the industry, exploring genres like no other, and telling the story in ways that haven't really been done before. Tenet, is a film that will leave your head spinning in different directions especially towards the end, where I think it's the most head spinning bit. However, when you realize what had just happened, you only be left with either nothing to say, or wow. Tenet is a film which I would definitely watch again in a heartbeat. It may hurt your head but it will be worth it for this film, which is like no other.",Tenet
1580,tomridertrx,It is Nolan's worst.,2,30 November 2020,"Nolan screwed it up with the story and presented in a really complex manner which a layman will not be able to deduce even after watching it the third time.
First of all, the plot is very simple and predictable, one you might have seen a lot of time. I'll not go into details but, in a line, it's the same old ""A secret agency trying to save the world from a Russian mafia who wants to destroy the world by setting off a bomb."" This specific formula is overused in movies specifically James Bond and Mission Impossible. At least with those movies you know what's going on and with the latter you might get some unforgettable action sequences.
What nolan tried to do here was to spice it up a little, add some sci-fi elements, specifically, time inversion and time travel (time inversion in a way is time travel at normal speed and if you'll perceive it this way, you'll be able to understand the movie in a better sense). But the implementation is very confusing. The pacing of the movie is really fast without any character development. Maybe if you have a degree in Quantam Physics then you might be able to understand, otherwise no you can't. I'm pretty sure, Nolan wrote a linear script but accidentally put those pages in randon order.
The acting part is well taken care off. The characters are convincing and justify whatever parts they were given. But, none of them were relatable.
Cinematography is good but not great.
VFX are great. All the special effects used in this movie, be it physical effects or CGI, is different, and looks good. All the time inversion sequences are pleasure to watch even though you can't make out any of it.This is definately a step down from Interstellar, The Prestige, Memento, Inception and his other movies. Even primer and The Triangle were easy to understand.Pro tip: Watch Edge of Tomorrow, if you haven't already or if you have than you can watch again. That movie have everything that this one is lacking.",Tenet
1581,jimmyaseto,Confusing,1,9 December 2020,I was completely confused & I'm an very smart adult. It's as if Christopher Nolan aimed at confusing his audience. The plot line doesn't make sense even with its hypothesis. I wouldn't recommend watching it,Tenet

The movie had one cool scene (when they robbed the plutonium truck) but the rest of the movie was impossible to follow. The explanation scene at the gun range was way too short and offered little insight to what followed. Most of the characters had no depth and the main relationship between the wife and Washington made little sense. Did they really blow up a 747 for this movie? What a waste. Maybe Leo DeCap could have saved this film but even Michael Caine didn't help. Everyone says watch it again, but I don't think I have enough Tylenol to do so.",Tenet
1584,jameswentland,Love this film,10,27 November 2020,I loved this film from the cinematography to the crazy confusing plot all through out my tiny little brain was sat there thinking how does Christopher Nolan pull it off time an time again and all though this very much flopped at the box office it is not because the film is bad it is a case of that it was released in a global pandemic for one of the first films to come out after months of none it is extremely good and up to the standard of many others . The acting is great and the cast choices interesting but the true highlight of this film is the plot you just need to see it to believe it,Tenet

1586,Andy-Wheale,"The more you think about it, the worse it gets.",3,29 September 2020,"You go through a curve of understanding with this film. This review contains mild spoilers, however I wouldn't really regard them as spoilers because they are all in the trailer and the ""twist/reveal"" is so incredibly obvious nearly everyone will pick up on it before it even comes into fruition on first viewing.The first time you watch it its extremely unlikely you will understand the majority of the film. You will enjoy it, the action sequences will blow you away, you will unfortunately be slightly deaf for a day or two afterwards, and you will be frustrated with the indeciperhable dialogue for a good 20% of the film. In general though, you will have a blast, 9/10.The second time you will watch it you will get a much better understanding of the ending, and you will be able to ""combine"" the plot together much better, you will start to question if the audio issues, especially in the Freeport exposition sequence and the second chamber sequence are done deliberately? You will still however not understand the car sequence, no chance. 8/10.The third time you watch it you will now pretty much fully understand it, and you will then start to realise bits of it unfortunately dont make sense by the films own rules, or even completely ignore the rules for the sake of plot. In addition you will realise that ultimately the relationship between the Protagonist and Kat doesnt make any sense whatsoever, why would he even care? which kinda rips a lot of sense out of the whole thing, and also that in reality you dont really care about literally any of the cast at all. Also you will come to the conclusion that Sators ultimate reason for his evil plan is really weak on the ground and doesn't really make any sense. 6/10The fourth time you watch it you realise that at least half of the film doesnt actually make sense at all, as in... definitely not. There are 3 absolutely massive issues all in the name of special effects: The guy going backwards through the wall doesnt work (the building would of needed to of been built around him, or the wall itself needs to be reversed, in both cases impossible), Neil cannot be alive in the cage at the end at all, even in reverse, and if he dies in reverse what happens to the body? The car cannot be reversed, at all. Its impossible. (it wont even fit in the time chamber). The bullet in the opera house is reversed, and causes damage in real time. The holes in the window in the Freeport chamber are already there in realtime, before the bullets are fired, and then when the gun is fired in reverse time it heals the bullets in real time. You cannot have both. Its either one or the other. 4/10The fifth time you watch it you will see completely past the special effects and sequences that make no sense to core issues with the film, not even the time manipulation aspect, the actual plot itself and the characters in it. At the end Kat could of quite easily just Tranquillised or knocked out Sator - problem solved, this renders the entirety of the rest of the film completely null and void, and this course of action makes far, far more sense than what they actually do. The complete lack of character building for every character with the exception of Sator/Kat, the whole ""TeneT"" gesture/word setup gets used... once. We never understand the organisation, or even why the entire ""test"" at the start is even necessary, if they were trying to keep it secret the whole concept is so ridiculous that if anyone did defect and try to tell an authority they would just think you were completely mad, and on top of that you could easily just reverse yourself and kill the defector before they defect. There is no need for the secret TeneT organisation at all, whatsoever. Why the hell was the indian arms dealer woman in the car outside the school at the end? Literally ridiculous. And so on, and so on... the more you think about it... 3/10I'm conclusion;
You never get this with Interstellar, you never get this with Inception. TeneT drops into the ""Memento"" category, where the film is ""enjoyably confusing"" to watch the first time round, however on subsequent viewing you come to realise that it cant even stand on its own two feet (the memento case being that its impossible for him to remember that he has no memory. Once you take this into account that film is also, completely ridiculous.)Nolan has MacGuffins in all of his films, gimmicks really, sometimes they work very well (inception sleep device in briefcase, interstellar forth dimension) however most of the time they just don't work at all and are actually plot destructively bad (batman begins water boiling device, memento remembering total memory loss, prestige cloning device). TeneT fits into the latter of the two categories.I give it 3/10 because ultimately, its a feat of cinematography just to even make the damn thing materialise on screen. However thats it. The characters are poor, the plot is frankly terrible, the concept is cool but totally flawed, the sound design is abysmal, the dialogue is crap (theres only two memorable piece of dialogue in the entire film), the music has one good theme, the other music in the film is unremarkable or jarring.The film says ""Dont try to understand it, feel it"" - On first viewing I thought it was a cool line, on my fifth and final viewing it comes across as a disclaimer.",Tenet

1588,philcald,Really poor audio that ruins enjoyment of the movie.,4,3 January 2021,Rather confusing movie which might be good however the really poor and annoying audio placement over important dialogue makes viewing this movie a disappointing venture.Also the general audio volume for most of the movie is poor resulting in you having to increase the volume to hear what's happening and then being deafened with the annoying and misplaced soundtrack.,Tenet
1589,Steeler92,Completely lost,4,26 February 2021,"Let me atart by saying Inception is my favorite movie. Interstellar was good, bot hreat in my opinion but I can see why people love that film. This flick is neither of those. Trying to grasp any semblance of a plot in this movie is bear impossible. It jets into the action so quickly it leaves hardly any chance to catch up. I compare it to watching a plot-heavy tv show starting in season 2 with no ability to see what happened in season 1. There are a couple scenes that were excellent (without spoilers I will say the airport scene was one of these). Overall, I have to agree with others that the dialogue was muffled most of the time, that action scenes had headache inducing volume, and the characters were bland. I did not care for any one of them. I am a big fan of Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) . Some say his character was the lone bright light of the film. I completely disagree. His Russian oligarch was a cliche Bond villian. Not even a good cliche either. In conclusion, I don't know where Nolan was going with this film. It seems like he took everything from his other movies and threw it at the wall to see what stuck (the complex plot of Inception, the volume of Dunkirk, the action of Dark Knight, etc.). I had such high hopes for this film, but it left me wishing I had just watched a 2.5 hour trainwreck.",Tenet
1590,peter wheeldon,Less than the sum of its parts,7,27 August 2020,"First, the positives.It is impressively made, with all the effort to do everything without greenscreen/CGI very much there on the screen.It feels epic and, for a 150mins film did not drag.Some of the twists and turns are clever and give you an ""oh, right"" moment.All of the leads are good, although Washington's character was a little bland, with Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh the standout performances.Although it is dressed up as a serious, thoughtful film, at its heart it is a tribute to the 007 movies. Multiple exotic locations, big practical effects and stunts, a plot which doesn't stand up to a great deal of critical analysis and a great villain.There are some amazing practical effects. So good in fact that it is easy to miss what you are seeing until you have a ""hang on, how are they doing that..."" moment. If there is a ""making of"" segment on the Blu-ray it might be worth buying just for that.But...Background music and effects drowning out the dialogue is a common complaint where Christopher Nolan is concerned. Where the concept of the movie is explained early on (Inception, Interstellar) this is not such as problem. With Tenat though, the plot develops over the course of the movies with several plot twists. Unfortunately some essential pieces of exposition are almost impossible to make out on a first hearing, leaving me and others watching with me with no idea why certain things were happening. At least three key scenes introducing important plot elements were incomprehensible for the most part.Perhaps because it is hard to follow in places, several potentially interesting set ups seem to go no where or remain unexplained.No spoilers here but the central theme of the plot is complicated, which helps in some ways whist watching, as you do not have time to analyse anything. However afterwards various holes in the logic and physics become clear.When ultimately the big baddies plan and the reason behind are revealed, it seems trite and weak. With a bit of thought it also makes no sense whatsoever, as achieving the ultimate aim would make no difference to the instigators of the plot..Overall, I admired the skill in making this film, its ambition and the efforts made to put everything up on screen. The problem for me was, at its heart, the central plot was not that thrilling or engaging.",Tenet
1591,asdfqaz123,So much hype so little substance,3,27 January 2021,"I liked Nolan's previous movie, Interstellar, so much that I thought this movie was going to stay faithful to the law of physics, at least to the limit that's allowed in a sci-fi film. But I was thoroughly disappointed when I realized this movie was actually the new installment of the James Bond franchise that involves time machine.Who in the right mind will discover time travel and then hide the work in 9 different locations Temple of Doom style rather than just destroying it? Even if it's destroyed, wouldn't someone in the future's future discover time travel anyway? It's as if Nolan believes without Galileo, we'd still be in the dark ages right now.This movie, unfortunately, falls into the same trap as other time travel movies: it exaggerates the potency of time travel and the importance of the main character. Making it nothing but a run of the mill sci-fi film.",Tenet

1594,Nolg101,"Breakneck action, Nolan at his best!",8,25 January 2021,"Tenet has received high praise from many critics and it certainly deserves credit for taking some high risk chances that paid off in terms of the screenplay, but not in terms of how the film is playing out at the box office. It's unfortunate that this is Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film because it was released during a year where people abandoned movie theaters due to the global coronavirus pandemic.
According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, a tenet is a principle, belief, or doctrine generally held to be true, especially : one held in common by members of an organization, movement, or profession. It's also a palindrome, a word that is the same both backwards and forwards, like racecar, mom, or even detartrated, which is a chemical term meaning to remove tartrates. It's an aptly chosen word for the title of this movie as the promotional poster evinces.This is probably one of my favorite Nolan films because it's his first film where a non-white actor plays a central role to the film. John David Washington, who plays the aptly named role of the Protagonist, is of course Black and his character brings a different dimension to this Nolan film than Inception, Dunkirk, or Interstellar all brought. Nolan's screenplay is wise to utilize its Protagonist's abilities/appearance, instead of hiding from it which is something that major Hollywood blockbusters have done before. John Boyega has been critical of Disney/Star Wars brass for their double talk/action in this regard in the past. There's a great scene as the film is developing the Protagonist character where Washington's acting prowess and impeccable delivery coalesce with Nolan's intuitive script and provide some laughs that split up the rapid fire action sequences.Criticism of the film has substantially fallen on the notion that the audience is subjected to a storyline of which the film hasn't given them enough of a reason to care about. Without giving away too much, although personally I may agree, the film's innate ability to chug along at a breakneck pace and its other qualities will likely make audiences forgot about this.",Tenet

1601,bungulahouwagadou,"Christopher Nolan's James Bond (German dub, brief spoilers)",7,4 September 2020,"Vor einigen Jahren gab es Gerüchte, Christopher Nolan würde den nächsten James-Bond-Film drehen. Wie ein Spionagefilm von Nolan aussehen würde, stellt er nun in seinem neuen Film zur Schau: Hier gibt es Bond-typische Szenen, in denen der Protagonist, Protagonist, eine Reihe Handlanger ausschaltet, vom Bösewicht zum Essen eingeladen wird (die Figuren sind alle entweder die Guten oder die Bösen), dort einige Szenen im Mission-Impossible-Stil, wo präzise getimte, unmöglich erscheinende Einbrüche gemeistert werden. Das Spionagefilmgenre wird aber mit dem Zeitreisefilm, genauer gesagt Zeitreise-Actionfilm, gemischt, bei der der Bösewicht durch die Zeit reist, um die Menschheit auszulöschen, und die Helden ihm folgen, um ihn aufzuhalten. Besonderes Gimmick bei Nolan: Die Zeitreisenden, die ""Inversen"", bewegen sich rückwärts durch die Zeit.Tenet ist ein Film mit den typischen Stärken und Schwächen eines Christopher-Nolan-Films. Die Charaktere bleiben blass und werden kaum charakterisiert, die Beziehungen sind schwach, die Dialoge sind schwach, vor allem, wenn sie allzu philosophisch werden, und der Film ist kitschig, beispielsweise im Verhältnis zwischen dem Bösewicht, Sator, und seiner Frau. Hinzu kommt, dass der Film sich komplizierter macht, als er müsste, indem er viel dialogbasiert und fremdwörterschwer erzählt, sodass man im Kino mal eins, zwei Sekunden überlegen muss, was mit ""bitemporaler Zangenbewegung"" gemeint ist.Die Stärke des Films ist aber gewiss seine Originalität. Wenn Inception ""Zeitlupe - Der Film"" ist, dann ist Tenet ""Reverse motion - Der Film"". Vor allem die Szenen, in denen Reverse Motion und Forward Motion zusammen im selben Bild sind, sind spannend anzusehen. Außerdem dreht Nolan auf Film und nutzt praktische Effekte statt CGI, was spätestens dann sehr befriedigend anzusehen ist, wenn ein Jet in ein Gebäude kracht.Leider lässt der Film auch einiges an Potenzial liegen. Es wird etwa das Problem erwähnt, dass eine Person sich selbst auslöscht (oder mit den Worten des Films: ""annihiliert""), wenn sich die ""lineare"" und die ""inverse"" Version desselben Ichs berühren. Dies passiert im Film keinmal. Auch die Möglichkeit, sich im Fenster der linearen Welt wieder aus der Zeitmaschine herauskommen zu sehen, wenn man dabei ist, in die inverse Welt einzutreten, um zu sehen, ob man Erfolg haben wird bzw. überlebt, wird kaum dramaturgisch genutzt. Man könnte erwarten, eine Figur bekommt dadurch auch einmal zu sehen, nicht nur ob, sondern auch wie sie Erfolg auf der Mission hatte, wie in einer selbsterfüllenden Prophezeiung - solche sind dramaturgisch immer großartig. Und natürlich, was passiert, wenn eine Person sich nicht zurückkehren sieht - geht sie trotzdem das Risiko ein und versucht, ihr Schicksal zu besiegen?Wenn man, wie etwa in Interstellar, einen großen Twist erwartet, wird man vermutlich enttäuscht sein, denn diesmal bleibt er aus. Ab der Rückkehr der Helden als inverse Zeitreisende zum Flughafen, in den sie vorher eingebrochen sind, könnte man erwarten, dass sie von nun an gegen ihre früheren Schritte aus der Vergangenheit vorgehen, doch nichts derlei. Auch die Beeinflussung zwischen der Vorwärts- und Rückwärts-Zeitabläufe, die Nolan zuzutrauen gewesen wäre, beschränkt sich auf einige wenige Momente. Und dann geht auch noch eine Aufopferung am Ende etwas unter.Das klingt jetzt alles etwas negativ. Dennoch ist mein erster Eindruck positiv, vor allem, nachdem sein letzter Film mich enttäuscht hat. Nolan erzählt diesmal nämlich auch teilweise auf filmisch interessante Weisen. Wir haben hier die vielleicht beste Nutzung von Reverse Motion in einem Film, eine gut gefilmte Folterszene, bei der ein Zug vor der Kamera entlangfährt und uns nichts sehen und hören lässt, einen brutalen Kampf mit Küchengegenständen und hier und da Narration via Gegenstände statt Erklärdialoge. Leider limitiert Nolan sich selbst durch kitschige Nebenhandlungen, bei denen die einzige Motivation die Wiedervereinigung einer Familie ist - Inception und Interstellar lassen grüßen. Es wäre interessant, zu wissen, wie ein Nolan-Film aussähe, würde er doch bloß Menschen und Emotionen verstehen. Der beste James-Bond-Film des Jahres ist Tenet vermutlich trotzdem.",Tenet

Dialogue was muffled throughout with loud ""futuristic"" music in every scene. Acting by the main guy was not good, while the Robert guy from the werewolf movies was very good, despite what he had to work with. He earned my respect as an actor in this otherwise nonsensical movie. Apparently the director is famous, but I'm not sure why as the storyline was a mess and impossible to follow, and the movie was 2.5 hours long. For no particular reason, timelines start moving backwards just because the main dude stares at an object (bullet, car, puddle). Fight scenes were very slow-moving with long pauses between punches or kicks, and just odd because I guess? at least some of the characters were fighting backwards, and there aren't any of the typical fighting sound effects.. oh and there's a poisonous gas in the atmosphere in certain scenes with no cause or effect. And of course an evil Russian who runs a plutonium syndicate. Also a fraudulent famous artist sketch at the beginning which is never reconciled. In summary, I roughly understand the plot is about a future evil force developing backwards time travel as a weapon, but otherwise why there are two sides and what the good guys want, vs what the bad guys want is never made clear. Characters have no depth, skills, or backstory or meaningful relationships, except that the main character is an awesome fighter sometimes, but then easily overtaken by two weak guys other times. Some cool special effects here and there. Wait for this one to end up at your local Red Box or the bargain bin at Walmart (yes I know those aren't things anymore).",Tenet

1607,mayank-s-dwivedi,"Unique Masterpiece by Nolan, a timeless epic movie !",10,8 December 2020,"Tenet is fast paced movie, with complex concepts that viewer might not get in the first viewing.It is that kind of a movie which will age like a good wine, and be recognized as a masterpiece as more watchers watch it and there is more outside explaining that gets done {either that, or watch this movie twice :-) }The loud music is the only thing I didn't like about the movie.I really liked the build up of the movie, as a concept is slowly laid out on you, and then suddenly viewer is thrown into the real life-living of that concept, trying to comprehend what is happening and linking it back to the movie pieces we saw sometime back.There is no dull moment in the film, and the non value add moments in the film start becoming important as the film progresses.I appreciate the dense content and the courage shown by the director to use a unique fiction concept and create a visually stunning experience for his viewers.
The story is unraveling as you watch the movie, and move with the main protagonist on his journey. You will feel as surprised, or shocked as the characters felt in the movie. Even before the fictional concept has settled in our minds, the movie is pacing ahead to prevent a world ending threat using the application of the same concept.",Tenet
1608,arias-569-36651,"Yes, maybe overly complicated but...",8,9 January 2021,"I love an intellectual challenge. Seems like some of the poor ratings struggle with that part. That said, Tenet was unnecessarily complicated at times. I don't need explanations handed to me (I hate when films do that), but I almost got the feeling the intent of those really complex plot/action scenes was specifically to confuse/disorient me. If that's true, kind of brilliant. If not, they were just trying a little too hard.Pace, action, effects... it was just fun to watch and kept me engaged. Having to frequently ""keep up"" with what's going on was a little frustrating at time... like the feeling of wanting to stop and scroll back but not wanting to break the action. Again, intentional? The opening concert scene was kind of overdone, maybe a little gimmicky, or the director wasn't quite sure what to do there. How about this analogy... like two lovers fumbling around in the back seat of a car for the first time. Pretty fun but kind of unsure, clumsy.The lead actors were really good. I really liked Washington's cool confidence but I sometimes got this sense that he was holding back his own personality to fit a part. I hope that make sense. I've really enjoyed watching Pattinson mature as an actor. Maybe felt like he was a better actor than the role presented. Not his fault on that though.I'll need to watch this a few more times. Kind of like the first time watching the film Inception, but even that was easier to follow. If a film makes it into my multiple-watch list, that's pretty high praise.",Tenet

1610,ReelVillain,Hawking on Acid,10,1 September 2020,"Arguably, Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of the modern era. Much like his films themselves, there are levels to his work. On one level he makes visually stunning movies and on another level genre-bending high concept thrillers that forever challenge and question the very nature of time itself. In short, the man creates art, not films. It should be no surprise to anyone that Nolan has finally gotten around to the spy field. So the reel question is will Tenet be more Hurst than Dali?Somehow Christopher Nolan knows how to take an idea that would be either laughable or ridicules in another director's hands and make is spellbinding. His work is forever walking the fine line between the sublime and the ludicrous. In Tenet, Nolan finally takes on the concept of time travel and it's real-world applications. Here he has come closer than any other director in history to speak on both the science and the purpose of time travel in our modern world.It would be a mistake to not say for much of the story Tenet is incredibly confusing. The opening sequence in particular outright doesn't make sense. The opera scene is beautiful to watch but even when the credits roll it leaves far too many unanswered questions. However, through pure will power alone Nolan still somehow beats his movie into submission and ultimately creates a failed masterpiece.That's the problem when you create such unique and challenging pieces, not all of them will be perfect. While I struggle to find anything to criticise about the film directly it was still somehow lacking for this critic. I just didn't enjoy it. There was no fun or laughter to be had. It was if Nolan had traded the amusement for the scientific and all the fantastical for the practical.Of course, Tenet does have grand set pieces and truly outstanding sequences but I don't feel like they can compensate for what feels like a cold-hearted movie. There is something altogether too surgical to Tenet for my liking, perhaps it was the pacing was too sporadic or maybe it was one step of madness to far but whatever it is, it kept me from loving the film.Tenet feels like a film with more brains than heart, which is the reverse of Nolan's other work. Lenny is motivated by the death of his wife, Dom wants to see his kids again and Cooper wants to save the world for his kids. In contrast, John David Washington's character (simply referred to as ""The Protagonist"") is motivated by a curiosity to pull on a string and see where it leads. There is a subplot involving an entrapped woman attempting to save herself and child from the monstrous Sator but that never feels like The Protagonist's driving force.Much like my previous references to art, Tenet is like a Picasso places on a wall in a beautiful frame that just can never quite hang right.Tenet is as close to perfect as you will find, but when you are Christopher Nolan, perfect just isn't enough.10 time-travelling bullets out of 10",Tenet
1611,abuffardi77,"Pretty good, not bad, not great, not really even ground breaking.",7,10 January 2021,"So, the movie requires an interest in time theory or some aspect of quantum physics or mechanics to understand the plot or point of the movie. If people aren't interested in this then Tenet will undoubtedly be confusing. I needed to spend five minutes to Google chronological entropy and came across the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Basically, the movie someone somewhere in the future experimented on technology that caused entropy to flow in reverse so that time moves two directions at once. And, in that case people can use a gateway to invert themselves to a particular entropy. In real life this experiment has been conducted with minimal success, but I did not search extensively for more results. Science aside the movie was pretty good.The movie is too close to Shadow of the Moon and Deja Vu, and people that seen those movies will know why. Shadow of the Moon actually utilizes the reverse arrow of time entropy, and in certain scenes you will feel you're watching Deja Vu.The blu ray DVD with a 5.1 digital surround was unwatchable; audio is trash; mixers gave up on production. The music and sound effects blur out over the dialogue. I took a chance watching it digitally on my PC through analog speakers and the sound was fine. Not many if any will do that, but either through PC or analog speakers might be better.Movie is clumsy and messy; scene transitions are disjointed; one minute in one country, the next in another. Things happen that are critical but seemed pushed to the back. The end is especially messy when red and blue teams take the field together.I didn't need to watch it twice.In sum the movie is a causal arrow of time; the effect and cause happen at the same time forwards and backwards.",Tenet

Yes, I get the comments about watching it twice and I'm sure it will make more sense if I watch it again now that I already know how the films ends.But that's not really the point. There are many great films which can't be fully appreciated at the first sitting and improve with subsequent viewings. They're still usually good the first time round. Tenet isn't, it's just confusing and lacking in enough other good qualities to be worth enduring the confusion.And that leads to the second big problem with Tenet - the casting of John David Washington in the leading role. Neither his face nor voice betray any emotion throughout the film - quite an achievement really, but it hardly makes for compelling viewing.The other actors do a decent enough job with the exception of Branagh, who appears to be striving to match Washington's wooden delivery.Is it worth watching twice? Well, I guess I might do at some point, although it took me three attempts to get through it the first time so it's probably fair to say I'm not in a hurry. 4/10",Tenet
1616,andrewjdavis-home,Flawed but fascinating and bold,9,1 September 2020,"The criticisms on this thread are all valid.Sound was spectacular but too noisy - the dialog was hard to follow at times.
The thread of the story is pretty convoluted so you won't be able to follow it in real time, but previous bits will start to make sense as it flows.
The basic concept was original but nearly failed spectacularly.
It also has some elements from Inception - especially the final set-piece.However I still thought it was great. Very good acting from the ensemble, JDW, ED and RP were excellent. KB can be a bit varied, but he was pretty scary in this one.I love it when a director tries something unique and kudos for this attempt as it is unlike any other story I have seen before, and well executed to boot.If your partner is someone who constantly tugs your sleeve during a movie to ask what is going on, best leave them at home.

Washington's Protagonist character is boring, uninteresting, and falls flat on his face with the forced comedic lines (no one laughed once in my theater). Every other character is either forgettable or purely there to give exposition. It is technically impressive with great visuals, action choreography and planning, as all Nolan movies are. It's time for Nolan to try something new and get away from exposition heavy, high concept movies. Dunkirk was a good step in the right direction, but Tenet falls back.

(reverse entropy?)TENET was to James Bond and Mission Impossible films, what a knock-off Luis Vutton bag would be compared to the real. It looks a LOT like the 100% genuine piece, but there are certain fine details and compromises in workmanship that make the knock-off fall short of the quality of the authentic piece.A 2.5 hour film should not feel like 2.5 hours when the viewer is immersed in the story, kept on the edge of their seat as they follow the twists and turns of the plot and find resolution to the actions, dialogue, and motives of the characters.But while watching TENET I felt every minute of that 2.5 hrs, and I found myself wishing the movie would go ahead and be over so I could go try to read something to help me understand what I had just watched. The director did not invest enough time and patience into deliberately breaking down the plot science, so that viewers like you and me who appreciate story immersion could at least be able to comprehend what we were watching without feeling confused and left out of the loop.This feeling of confusion and being 'lost' created an aggravating distraction from the movie experience. Eeven the car chases, fight scenes, and gun battles did not compensate for how the movie's fuzzy execution robs you of immersion.When you also add that the actors lines could barely be heard most of the time, and they hardly parted their lips to articulate their words, which made it a challenge to even read their lips when you couldn't hear their lines.Overall the I give 5 stars for the valiant effort to create an epic sci-fi blockbuster.

For the first hour I didn't understand much about the plot, but afterwards it provides important details. The last 30 minutes are spectacular. The action scenes are like never seen before. The background score helps to make scenes intense but also overpowers dialogue in some scenes. In short is Nolan's take on a Spy thriller film.

1629,mr-shcmr,Masterpiece ruined by terrible sound mixing,5,28 August 2020,"After months without going to the theaters, what a treat!Tenet is the best of what cinema has to give, with dazzling action scenes and the kind of mind-bending concept that only Nolan is crazy enough to deliver.
Set in the cold, confusing world of high-stakes espionage, the movie is tighter, more controlled than Inception. The central concept allows much less freedom than Inception's ""dream sharing"" did, but that's precisely the limitations that make it so exhilarating and satisfying to watch.The policy is ""no hand holding here"". We're sharing the view of the Protagonist spy, and have to figure out what's happening with as few clues as he gets. Active viewing is required to connect the dots. It would be bad if every movie was like that, but from time to time it's a refreshing change.Tenet is a very intense experience from first minute to last with little breathing room, efficiently highlighted by a pervasive soundtrack. It should delight all fans of Nolan's no-nonsense hard sci-fi style. And personally, it's my new favorite Nolan movie.
So, why 5/10?The sound in my theater was ridiculously loud. Other reviewers have reported the same experience, which leads me to believe that the culprit is the movie, not the theater. The voices are way quieter than the rest, which forces projectionists to choose between damaging people's ears and leaving half the dialogues inaudible. I've noticed that a lot of critics who pan the movie complain about not hearing the dialogues. It's easy to understand how frustrated one would be in a movie where every line can hold a key plot element.For a high-budget movie by a veteran director, there is simply no excuse. It's entirely on the movie for failing such a critical element.Even the best movie isn't worth getting hearing damage, hence 5/10.",Tenet

But yet here it is.The whole ""time-reversed"" plot may support the story but if you actually think about it, it makes absolutely zero sense and falls apart in many places. And a lot of times even contradicts itself.One time for instance when a car follows them driving reverse. But if those people started in the future and their time runs backwards, why would they drive the car in reverse drive? Just a few minutes later the main protagonist also goes back in time and he drives another car normally, proving you don't need to drive backwards.
Also at one point in the movie ""reversed people"" also talk reversed to people in the normal timeline, but later in the movie another ""reversed person"" can speak normally with the antagonist - who is not reversed. The same person also doesn't need an oxygen mask, yet the movie establishes earlier, that you can't breathe without a mask when going back in time.You'll understand later, they added/left out these elements to support the plot, but either didn't notice that they ended up contradicting themselves or simply didn't care. Its the sum of these little things that make Tenet seemingly understandable but actually very confusing logically.If it weren't for ill-considered plot, I would've rated Tenet at solid 7-8 stars.

That being said, this a great film with Director Christopher Nolan's signature all over it; a genre twisting story, an incredible score, next level practical effects and most of all... exposition fired in your face like a machine gun.From start to finish you'll be caught up in a world that you kind of recognise but may struggle to understand giving you a feeling of unease as you try to decipher the torrent of dialogue and that's before we even start talking about the use of 'Time Inversion' and 'Entropy'.There's a lot to process and just when you think you're grasping something BANG a whole new plot device or random character is introduced. What this film does expertly is reward those who are willing to pay attention. If you can put in the effort, follow along and learn the rules (and maybe have a degree in physics), you'll be gifted with a mind-altering experience.In true Nolan style there's plenty of 'Score', replacing his go to composer Hans Zimmer with the equally outstanding Ludwig Göransson, although coupled with the thumping sound design can make the already tricky dialogue hard to hear.Another of the Directors favourites did make the cut Michael Caine but only in a cameo. Relative newcomer John David Washington is great, however he did occasionally look like he was trying to understand the script (I don't blame him). The rest of the cast were good, Robert Pattinson brought a surprising endearing quality but I found it hard to warm to Elizabeth Debicki.Despite this being a very complex movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it, walking out of the cinema wanting to pull apart and piece back together so many elements of the story and its execution.

But first they have to get close to him and figure out how and why he wants to ignite the war to end all wars.Caveat; Unlike other reviews I don't plan to take take issue with the artists technical choices; volume of soundtrack, clarity of dialogue etc. I respect the opinion of other reviewers, people's varying sensibilities, individuals ability to comprehend accents, and so on.Let's get a few answers out of the way because time is precious.Is Christopher Nolan's TENET any good? YES, it is.It is, in my opinion, an astounding piece of cinema and I think all involved should be very proud of what they've been able to deliver. It really is a very original take on the possibilities, pitfalls and dangers inherent in the idea of time travel. It also fits well into the Directors continuing cannon of work.Is it an easy movie to understand? NO, not from an initial viewing. You definitely will come out of the cinema thinking blimey, that's a plateful.If this were a book you'd have to put it down more than a few times to think through chapter by chapter. But alas this is a movie in a cinema so it's a bit like gorging a seven course meal with no break from one course to the next. It could make your stomach hurt; hence many of the mixed reviews.The difficulty in understanding the movie is, I would suggest, less about the construction of the film and more about how complex the ideas in the movie are to grasp, especially when you get to the details. There's plenty of exposition to try and help us along but still - big curly ideas are what they are!TENET does warrant more than one viewing but it's so well put together that you'll want to see it again. It visually stunning. My favourite close thematic precedents would include the Spierig Brothers Predestination with Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook (I really like that film), and Primer (2004); but TENET really does amp up the whole time travel paradox theme into blockbuster territory.Is it an easy movie to like? This is where things get interesting.To answer that question it is necessary to ascertain who this film is for; or inversely who it is that might appreciate the level of complexity inherent in the narrative of this artistic endeavour.Truth be told some ideas are just hard to fully piece together. That is why we have geniuses, great minds, average minds, small minds and minds that need help to just make it through a day.A quote attributed to Elenor Roosevelt opines that 'Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.'In the light of this quote what Christopher Nolan is doing with this film is presentIng something the average mind should appreciate but really it is a narrative from a great mind intended for those who appreciate delving into meaty ideas - and let's face it time travel and it's inherent paradoxes aren't easy ideas to play with, especially if you really get into it.I suspect if Mr Nolan wanted to make a movie for the genius minds out there he could, but that's unlikely to deliver much of a financial return since there aren't that many geniuses available to fill cinema seats and guarantee overflowing coffers.The filmmakers should be applauded for even attempting to bring this story to the masses, knowing full well that 80% of us sit squarely in the 'minds needing help to get through the day' category. This film represents a triumph for original film making and I'm glad they took the risk. Cinema is enriched by their contribution.Do I recommend this film? Yes, because I want more films like this and for the film industry to wean itself off franchise fluff as the only means of it's future survival.I realise it's not for everyone but this small to average minded reviewer thought it was amazing.",Tenet
1646,qrules,What's the fuss about?,6,6 September 2020,"Warning! This review contains spoilers.Before I begin, the best summary of Tenet I can think of is this:Inception: Time is moving slower.
Interstellar: Times is moving faster.
Tenet: Yes!Here is why: while the first two movies tell a story in a linear way, the latter doesn't and not in a Tarantino non-linear way.Inception had a fresh idea and a fresh concept. Interstellar tried to be a modern version of 2001 where mankind is evolving into something else. Both of these two Nolan films have characters I can connect to and both films have spectacular visuals and excellent direction.This however has spectacular visuals and meticulous planing for the action scenes. Period. Neither has it a new idea nor characters I can connect with. The plot feels contrived, the Protagonist got recruited, I presume by Neil or events triggered by Neil (why else bring up the grandfather paradox?).
Then the so called protagonist had to go to Priya, to the wife, to the bad guy, to the wife to Priya to stop a thing to save all from total annihilation just to learn he recruited Neil. The loop is complete. The last movie with such a contrived scavenger hunt I saw was Rise of Skywalker.The idea of a temporal cold war isn't new either. Star Trek Enterprise came up earlier. The idea of total annihilation is even older.If you pay attention and assume Nolan follows the logic he sets up, you can figure out the ""good"" ending pretty early on. Or else the movie would simply stop after two minutes, because well...annihilation. Once I figured that out I got so bored I tried to figure out how he did the effects without computers.One might go deeper into the plot and what it all means, but you won't find any new or satisfying answers. Also since it is not really an ambiguous ending like in Inception or an emotional satisfying ending like Interstellar you'll waste time by trying to analyse it. The analysis is simply given by Neil when he says that whatever happens, happend. Never felt so trolled.But I assume the movie can be entertaining and it definitely is better than the trash we got before the beer bug.",Tenet
1647,daliranipardis,Good overall,9,25 April 2021,It was a good movie.very complicated to understand but if you have followed Nolan's movie you're definitely no stranger with this.the soundtrack was really good.the visuals were good too.,Tenet

1650,darkdorn,A lot of failures and awful sound!,2,24 December 2020,"I had no expectation but after the movie i felt disappointment. It almost seems that mr Nolan has became madman and the movie is made in a big hurry. First thing that started to be very quickly annoying, was the dialogue between characters. It felt like they had the text well memorized but in reality they didn't understand what they are speaking (or doing) causing them to speak with no emotion, like they were reading the text from the paper. And the same problem was there from start to the end. Only character who had more to offer was the main evil one.
This movie, being as ""blurry"" for your mind as it is, has so many errors, that you will find them probably for years to come. I will mention the biggest one. As they go back in time, they need to breathe ""different reversed air"", they are usually transported in a bubble and so on. At one point they go backwards in time trying to save the woman character. When they kind of arrive to the right destination everything gets out of hands. Suddenly the woman character doesn't need any special air to be at the Monte-Negro bay area, to swim to the boat. Going backwards in time should take away the scar completely without any medicine. The main bad character cannot have memories from events happening half a month later! The ""normal time"" woman, as all the other ones before her, should see the jumping woman going backwards, instead of the normal jump. In all that failure madness... the phone calls from the future. It almost seems, that mr Nolan didn't care enough and is really loosing his mind.",Tenet
1651,timoth93,A Shallow Ego-Trip From A Once-Great Director,1,23 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. Unlike so many directors who began their careers outside of Hollywood and then moved to Hollywood for mainstream success, Nolan has maintained creative control over his work. Moreover, his interests in the concept of time and the medium of non-linear storytelling have persisted from the smaller movies he cut his teeth on at the start of his career to the big studio flicks he is known for now. It is one thing to make cutting edge movies on a small budget, it is another to transition into making big budget movies that are accessible to the mainstream and it is yet another thing to be able to continue to push your trademark themes and aesthetic sensibilities throughout your diverse body of work. For that Nolan deserves to be commended.Unfortunately, Tenet is a heartless and charmless affair. This may very well be an example of an auteur getting swallowed by their own ego and losing sight of what made their movies great in the first place. Christopher Nolan has made some great movies over the course of his career and a lot of his movies are founded upon unique story-telling components. But the thing about Memento, with its reverse-order narrative, or Inception, with its dream-within-a-dream plot points, is that these story-telling components were just that - devices to tell a story and expand on the characters. For all Inception's plot twists and major action set pieces, the movie was held together by the pathos surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio's character who was grieving for his dead wife and the movie had a resounding message about letting go of the past and living in reality.With Tenet, the story-telling components are gimmicky and, although they come together to tell a complex story, I lost interest around the 90-minute mark. What good is a sophisticated plot if you care nothing for the characters? This movie, like a lot of Nolan movies, is built on one big, speculative concept which requires you to go with it to a large extent. But there is little effort to really make you invested in the characters or the world before that concept is introduced.Early reviews are praising John David Washington's charisma, but I can't say I saw that myself. Washington isn't bad, he does the best with what he's given, but his character (who is known simply as 'The Protagonist') is under-developed. There is also praise coming for Robert Pattinson and I will admit that Pattinson's performance may be the highlight of the movie, but that isn't saying much. Like 'The Protagonist', Pattinson's 'Neil' is a mysterious character without any clear back-story or motivation. A movie could work if one of the two leads were like that - but not both. Perhaps if they made Washington's Protagonist more grounded and relatable, then Neil would work with his wry, Christopher Hitchens-esque, mystique. Alternatively, if they gave Neil a fleshed-out backstory and motivation then he could have served as a focal point for the audience to see the more sublime Protagonist. Instead, both characters are effectively superheroes with ultra-competence but poorly fleshed out development and motivations.Reviewers will undoubtedly note the action sequences and the special effects of this movie - which are impressive - though I feel that Nolan could have heeded the 'less is more' principle a bit more. By the end of the movie I was so worn out with the action and trying to keep up with it, that I was no longer impressed by the visuals. Instead of staging these complex action scenes, greater emotion could have gone into them to get us to feel the stakes. Then again, what are stakes when you care nothing for the characters?",Tenet
1652,Crystxl_,We Live In A Twilight World,9,31 August 2020,"Ever since the first teaser for Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" came out, I've been excited for this movie.As a self-acclaimed Nolan fan I can say that I was extremely hyped for this movie. But for a director like Nolan who has brought films like Memento, Inception, Interstellar and many more incredible pictures, the stakes are pretty high - and this kind of concerned me. Nowadays it happens far too often that a good director cannot deliver just that little bit ""more"" that with hoped for.I watched the trailers, read some first impressions and watched no-spoiler reviews, which didn't really help me out because I felt like people either loved it or hated it. For those that haven't watched the movie yet, I really want to suggest not forming a certain concern involving any issue that critics and viewers have brought up - instead go check it out for yourself.I saw a bunch of people talking about a sound mixing issue, but I didn't experience any issues with that. My friend did tell me he thought the movie was ""loud"", but besides that nothing was wrong with it (maybe it depends on the cinema).Anyhow, while watching the movie I was on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is amazing, so are the set pieces. I absolutely loved the score too. I was pleasantly surprised by the acting delivered by Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki and John David Washington. In my opinion they did great. Of course the plot and the idea of inversion was something I had never seen before, which was great because it was something original and new (which is quite rare these days). I'd say Nolan absolutely nailed the thriller spy type of genre.Even though I went in with the mindset ""don't try to understand; feel it"", I ended up trying to puzzle everything together with my friends - and I loved that. We talked about the movie on our way back home for a long time, and I'm still thinking about it now. I feel like I understand, but I wouldn't be able to explain it. This is one of those movie where it's okay to be confused, that's part of the experience. I'm sure that when I watch ""Tenet"" again, I'll learn a lot of new things but I'll also have a lot of new questions.My verdict; 9/10. I'm not giving this movie a ten because I kind of missed having a connection to the protagonist. I know it was meant to be this way, but in my opinion a movie is more suspenseful when you have some sort of reason to like the main character (as in backstory). Besides that, I loved everything about this.Certainly go check it out for yourself!",Tenet
1653,ewanbryce,Have A Time Stile Will Travel,8,31 August 2020,"Tenet is undoubtedly one of Christopher Nolan's most audacious films. If you were blown away by Inception, this will leave you in a state of cerebral apoplexy. The entire concept of time travel is re-written. No retrofitted suped up DeLorean here thank you very much. My only gripe would be that the final act of the film is a tad overwrought which left me a more than a little confused, but that could just be me. My major complaint is that the sound mix lacks focus and definition in some scenes, but beyond this Tenet is exceptional. As usual the cinematography and visual effects are on par with what you'd expect from Nolan's films. I wouldn't say it's one of his best films, but it ranks fairly high.",Tenet

Tenet followed Nolan's checklist and produced some incredible action sequences. Inspiring performances from John David Washington and Robert Pattison - they both enhanced some of the more dramatic scenes. However, I've said multiple times that one thing Nolan lacks is a dramatic enough script but I finally think that in Tenet, the fast paced dialogue was perfectly fit for the score and the visuals. Although it was a terrific film by Nolan I still wouldn't but it above Inception.",Tenet

1659,spacekarma,A time loop paradox - scifi written probably by a scientist,7,28 September 2021,So I watched this movie only now and not in cinema after reading lots of bad reviews calling this movie stupid. I think it's not stupid it's actually pretty smart.The war that started this all actually captured everyone in this alternate earth into a time loop paradox where the time actually travels from A to B and then when it reaches it's end point it doesn't jump to beginning but actually flows backwards from B to A. So half of the movie happens forward while half of the movie is backwards and the watcher has to connect the points to make any sense.The Idea of the movie that is played in the same time in both directions is just pure genius.This idea must only come from a science mind because for us 3 dimensional beings this is very very confusing. But that the time is in a constant flux and cannot be changed is basically the whole meaning of this movie.They try to avoid something that already has happened will happen and would happen even if they didn't do anything.And they constantly try to avoid telling their other self to actually change something. The protagonist actually interacts few times with him self in the movie without realizing but has a mask so he doesn't compromise the timeline which in the end actually make this time loop happen in first place. There is few things they didn't want us to know and that is how this happened actually in future? How do they know before it happens?Only ridiculous thing I found was reverse air that you must take so you can move backward. I think they should have gone with a special suit that can reverse radiation or something more meaningful. And this little ridiculous thing and the anti climactic ending was why I gave this movie a 7. First 1 hour of the movie could be really mostly reduced and ending fixed. But the whole idea for the movie was ingenious.,Tenet

1663,arjunceltic,Almost a masterpiece,8,30 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan does it again, every movie he makes is always special, his movies manage to demonstrate the spectacular, but at the centre of his movies are the characters. They play such a huge and vital part in taking the story along,which is why even with the convoluted plot lines of a Nolan movie, the movie goer has a vested interest as they feel a strong sense of connection with the characters. Here is where Tenet misses, I feel Nolan held the concept of the movie with higher regard than he did on the story or the characters. I didnt feel as worried or connected to some of the characters as I did in Inception, Interstellar or The Prestige. Its not that it does not happen, it does, but only after about an hour of the movie do you feel for the characters. However, it just shows how excellent Nolan is as a director as everyone compares his own movies to each other. All I will say is Tenet does not hold up great to Nolans other works, but against most movies coming out from Hollywood nowadays? It is a world beater. As Nolan himself says, he wants his audience to ""feel the movie"" and Tenet does excatly that. Side note: You will have to watch it a second time, I cant wait to watch it a second time to pick up on everything.",Tenet

1665,ryleereiter,The Five Year Screenplay,6,3 December 2020,"In regards to this film, I'll start out giving it justice where it is overwhelmingly deserved. The cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful, the acting was superb, and the effort towards making this film was clearly present. Now for the hard part. This movie's infection is the same infection of the antagonist in this film, and that is narcissism. If you're going to make a film this complex and science fiction based involving physics and/or time travel, please take the time to spend towards an explanation of believable context, and not spend 90 minutes filming people running and fighting backwards. Mr Nolan, you are a great director, but nobody has the 10 hours to dedicate towards making sense of this film in a way that the film can be appreciated more than for its acting, cinematography, and its acting. Also, I have a distaste for movies that crank the volume for its action, but then try to use quiet dialogue and accents for its plot structure, in a manner that you have to lean in just to hear something that you probably won't understand until the second time you see it. This film took Nolan 5 years to write the screenplay for. My, my, that is a very long time, not to involve more science in a science fiction movie. I understand that there were many creative scenes in which time moved backwards to give us a glimpse of the future. Many of them were very interesting to watch. Most were not. The actions of the female lead were the one part of this film that felt relatable, as a part of the human species.

Wasn't sure what to expect what with all the reviews about it trying too hard or being too dense. I'm happy to report that I found those reviews utterly untrue. I loved it!! The only way this movie could be improved is for Christopher Nolan or an acolyte to remake it better in the future, tbh. Heh heh.It is definitely very fast-paced as far as plot explanation goes; I think this was not only to drive the urgency of the story but also to ensure no important details would have to be cut out for time. Otherwise, the plot and rationale seemed pretty airtight to me.Some have reviewed that the plot was scattered--I actually found it to be structured like levels, leading the viewer to understand concept 1 first, then concept 2, etc., building the complexity after first demonstrating an idea. Not all the events that took place had a real 'point' or the outcome the characters wanted, because the character(s) were learning/exploring, to some extent. Can't say much more on that without giving spoilers.The tone of the acting from all the cast was somewhat straightforward, not full of huge gestures; but I didn't mind this at all, as this is one hell of a huge story trying to burst out into being and the most important thing was for it to be told right. Plus this made the more subtle craft of the leads all the more noticeable, for example Robert Pattinson slipping between personas when undercover, John David Washington's emotions toward the end.My only grievance would be the casting decision of having Elizabeth Debicki in the role she played. There were too many similarities with her role in the Night Manager--it's a recent enough series that I kept thinking about that plot and getting distracted. She did a great job, but it was like seeing Tom Cruise in a Bourne movie. Confusing.Casting overall was very, very good though. Diverse/inclusive, great characters, great looks. Robert Pattinson is so good in a role like this, and John David Washington can eat 007's heart out. Kenneth Branaugh was kind of unrecognizable, in a good way. The action and fight scenes were so natural and believable, sometimes bordering on graceful or casual.I love that Christopher Nolan has such enthralling stories to put up on the big screen. He makes use of cinema as an industry and creative medium, to use to introduce incredible sci-fi (maybe futuristic?) ideas to us.

But that, that's only half the story here, because a lesson in physics isn't fully complete without government espionage set across multiple countries. But what really frustrates me is the potential this had going into the final hour. Two well built relationships, a budding cop comedy set up between lead and BFF Pattinson and an extremely well written vengeful hatred between husband and wife. What could have been.

With such a complicated story which didn't seem to make sense, dialogue delivered super fast and fairly mumbled I simply did not know what the hell was going on.
Also there were few crazy visuals or epic music. The whole film has some trance track going on (which reminded me of the equally underwhelming Pulse by Danny Boyle). No Hans Zimmer here I'm afraid.

1679,Nostromo21,Pretentious in an untimely manner...?,6,28 November 2020,"*** POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***Ok, I don't review many titles, but I feel the need to address this self-agrandizing Nolan 'epic' for what it is. And that is, a quasi-scientific bunch of hooey about a topic that clearly neither Nolan nor his target audience know much about. Having studied time, causality, quantum mechanics, GR/SR & a number of other time-related branches of physics, I have to say, I was quite under-whelmed by this one-trick pony. So much that I found it almost as annoying as Memento, or Matrix 2 & 3, a couple other one-trickers. Before you jump to conclusions, yes, I got it, I understood what it was all about, while piecing together the barely-heard conversations & expositions at several points in the film - turn down the effing music Nolan - I can listen to classical music any time I want without having to strain to hear someone bloody well speaking about major plot points!The main issue I have with Tenet is that it's all sci-fi nonsense & barely good sci-fi at that, mostly fantasy actually. Real physics aside, it just wasn't entertaining once you get the 'trick'. It just tried too hard to pander to neo-intelletuals with quasi-science causality mini-loops splattered throughout. Not to mention the motivations of the main bad guy are non-sensical, except for a completely insane psycopath who somehow manages to keep everyone loyal around him in the dark...because if they even had an inkling of what he wanted to achieve, why in God's name would anyone NOT completely insane ever help the maniac??? It's patently absurd & ridiculous with a number of glaring inconsistencies & plot holes that most will just gloss over. Even as pure entertainment I felt that my intelligence was being insulted, and I'm certainly no genius-level intellect! I can only imagine how all the poor career physicists must feel out there, to see their life's work assaulted by Hollywood like this yet again...In the end, it's about as satifying as invert sugar (pun intended). Watch at your own risk if you have 2.5 hrs to kill you definitely won't want back on your death bed. For the rest of you with some sense, I recommend you watch Primer instead if you want a more 'realistic' foray into time & causality loops, without the big budget, car chases & CGI explosions. You have been warned. 6/10 (mostly for Caine, Pattinson & the scenery)",Tenet

As if Nolan was excited to show off what he could do, the proceeded to beat us over the head with his ""greatness.""Some compare him to Kubrick... STOP! All of Kubrick's films are character driven with technique that matched the conceit.Plot: an inventor from the future hides a device in present day, which inverts time causing the user to go forward and backward on the same time line. An arms dealer wants said device, will use it to get back at his wife, and while dying also cause the plausible end of existence (eye roll). Tenet is recruited by a man he just met, or always knew, or previously recruited while in inversion.Writing that plot makes me angry. So convoluted. If the Dark Knight Trilogy were as convoluted as Tenet all the fam boys would burn Nolan at the stake.I found this film grueling.

1681,marvin2603823,Wow!!!,10,10 January 2021,"Spolier free!!
I'm going to start off saying that in normal times I do not let reviews sway me from watching movies but as we all know with the virus movie theaters (which is normally a weekend hobby for me) are not really an optimal place to view new titles. That being said lately I've been letting the reviews sway my viewing a little more since advanced viewings at home are almost the price of the movie to own. Tenet is a movie that I was very reluctant to watch. I've enjoyed Christopher Nolans movies for a good portion of my life, Tenet is in my opinion his greatest achievement yet. The movie does have its flaws as they all do but I found myself completely engrossed in this film from the very start. If you just pay attention this is easily a single viewing movie to know whats going on. Robert Pattinson blew me away like he never has before and I'm even more stoked for the new batman now!! John David Washington in the start of the film had me worried about his acting but I almost feel like it was part of the experience..he too was amazing in this film. Elizabeth Debicki and Kenneth Branha are also superb..hell even most of the supporting cast are great. The action was great,the story was great, and the emotion was there. It would be absolutely astounding for Christopher Nolan to be able to explore this sci-fi,spy,suspense universe that he just set up. Don't listen to the negative reviews and open your mind to yet again another amazing Nolan film!!!!",Tenet

1687,zerny,Visually Stunning,7,1 December 2020,I would say this movie is definitely not the best work of Nolan yet. The story has less of character developments and backgrounds to offer and rather a more complicated plot on forwards and backwards of the events which may not be as shocking when you find out what they are meant to be. It has failed to connect me on a more elevating emotional level. I would give it a 7.5/10.,Tenet
1688,chloemichelleashby,Did the high raters review the wrong film?,1,28 September 2020,"After watching this film, I was surprised to find how many positive reviews it had. I'm not hugely critical of films usually but I expect a plot, or at least a decent meaning behind what is happening... A beginning, middle and an end would be a start particularly when we paid over £30 for the pressure, if you can call it that. With this film, you get none of that. Was I watching the same film as these reviewers that rated it 8/9 or 10 out of 10??What you get is thrown right into it, with little too no explanation for what is going on or why. Do they explain the purpose of anything? Not really. You should apparently care about the protagonist which he himself says that's what he is numerous times through out the movie because apparently the audience will forget after 20 minutes. The other characters are either good or bad with no inbetween with cliché lines that you start to wonder if the writer wrote the script when drunk or in a state of extreme constipation as the lines become so rushed that even when a legend such as Michael Cane appears, it becomes rebottic with no life. I wonder why he gave this film any time of day, perhaps he knew this film would be an easy payday. The script in general is just a bunch of rambling, in places it's hard to hear what is being said but all of that doesn't matter because everything that's being said makes no sense. The extreme music which for some reason happens when Nothing is happening, seems to give the impression that something amazing will happen but does it? No. The only purpose the poor choice of music serves is to distract the viewer from the terrible film they're watching. The music was so loud at one point, I was wondering if I accidently went to a rave instead of the cinema. The fight scenes were so robotic and anti climatic that it might as well of been two grannies fighting in a retirement home, I don't understand why other reviews mention good action scenes... They must have been watching another film. The soldier scene had a lot of shooting but barely any enemies, it looked like they were just shooting at empty windows... One soldier looked like he was taking a lifetime to take a clip from his pocket, I guess most scenes they just did one take and didn't bother to try it again. The 'bad guy' was boring and had no reason behind his character, I guess without character development it's hard to care or understand his reasons. In most scenes, he went from one extreme to the other with no reason or motivation. The 'good guy' was also boring and I didn't care if he lived or died. He suddenly cares about the bad guys woman, why? We don't know, the chemistry between all of the characters including the 'good guy' and this woman are either forced or non existant. Robert Patterson looked sauve at first but ended up being another character with poor lines and by the end, was the cheesiest of them all...miscast in my opinion. Perhaps the only redeeming factor is the special effects but will I be amazed by this alone? No. Just because you can use special effects, does not mean that you should over look other key elements needed to make a film good and just because you can use certain effects, doesn't mean you should. The time travel plot has been done before and in a much more effective way, with better acting. In my opinion, I would rather have a good script and plot than an empty shell with a lot of special effects... I was so bored that I didn't care about backwards bullets, by that point I was already looking at my partner sitting next to me and whispering 'do you know what's going on?' Of which he replied 'No I have no clue.' If anything we found this film to be a comedy and had more fun laughing at the ridiculous scenes where even the actors didn't seem to know what was going on. The amount of oxymoron lines used in this film gave me a good laugh.It felt like the cast did this film just for a easy pay check, can you blame them? No, after all it seems the standard of films has lowered so much over the past 10 years that there could be a film with just a black screen and there would still be fans... A black screen would have been better than this film. I found the previews more interesting, if only I watched one of those films instead. I was so bored 20 minutes in, that I fell asleep for about 10 minutes and unfortunately got woken up because of the over the top music that could have blown my ear drums. If you have sensitive hearing, I would not recommend this film. Actually, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Save your money for something with a purpose or meaning, as this film has none. Possibly the worst film I've seen in cinema.",Tenet
1689,paul-lloydburrell,Ultimately It's An Adventure,9,29 November 2020,"At first I was wondering why the rating of currently 7.8, and even when the movie came out, I was puzzled as to why it seemed many were somewhat down on it. After being halfway through it currently I understand. It would be extremely hard to like in a theater overall probably. Mainly because alot of the dialogue is muffled very badly. I wonder if it was done purposely. It had to be with so much detail put into the movie itself. Also, with a movie of this type it definitely has to be paused or re watched to fully appreciate it's gravity. I tend to think the average viewer isn't too interested in that overall, nor do they want to think at the level this movie requires.To me it's a masterpiece of cinema for folks who like thinking, thrillers, action, and heist based movies. I'm not so sure the general public is big on those movie types. I say that because movies like The Town which is a GREAT film, has a solid rating, but not as many reviews as other movie types. Inception which was great also had big name recognition to carry it, and I think the female presence helped it in ways Tenet might suffer overall. Some times great art isn't appreciated by the masses, and I think that will be the case with this one. I tend to think it will do very well once it's available for home viewing. I see it as an adventure. It's perfect for what it is.",Tenet

1692,harrybraff,Sometimes a fantasy is all you need.,8,19 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan has been hit or miss over the years. But when he is on, he's on. Tenet is on.
Ever since I first saw the trailers last year, I was interested. And with going to the movies becoming such a rarity in 2020, I was looking forward to a magical movie experience and crossing my fingers that Mr Nolan would deliver. And I am happy to say that Tenet did the trick for me.
It is not a perfect movie, but it provides a modern day movie experience unlike any other I have ever seen. It does follow the normal 3 act film structure, but that seems to be where it's conventional ties somewhat taper off. Tenet is unconventional to say the least. It is a visual spectacle, the screen popped with crisp originality. The acting was strong, although the dialogue seemed mostly to service the plot. As far as the story, I can understand how some can find it confounding, perhaps unnecessarily so; however that does not mean the story is lost within the plot. It is not. This is solid story telling with an original and modern delivery.
I recommend Tenet, but it is a provisional recommendation. I understand that not everyone goes to the theater for the same reasons. I do like a well-told story. Delivery is key. I found myself comparing Tenet to other mind-bending time twisters: Primer, The Matrix and Donnie Darko specifically.

They do spell out the concept in a couple of brief scenes but then abandon any science in favour of action .There is plenty of relentless high voltage action if that's your thing and some genuine stunt work was great to see but it all becomes a little pointless if you don't really understand why it's all happening .If you don't like it really loud take some ear plugs . The score is thundering but a little overused for my liking . It is accomplished and brilliant film making but my first impressions were that I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of his previous films .

This has to be Nolan at his most ambitious, yet most formulaic (such a disappointment after Dunkirk). Action scenes, aesthetics, main themes, everything was somehow very reminiscent of his older movies. Counting too much on exposition actually hurts the plot here (even if you loved the movie you'll agree that films with similarities in terms of scope, such as Inception, were way more interesting), and the pompous finale didn't do any favours either. It's as if Nolan got carried away by his extreme passion for this project, which is not transformed perfectly on screen.

Person B (instead of just replying ""yes"" like a human): It's the hyperalgorithm needed to reverse the inverse proton destabilizer.
And then person A, who by know ought to know that person B knows what X is, goes on to explain it a little more, and then they take turns explaining it to us in the audience. That is bad dialogue and that's a bad script.Sound is off too.The visuals are very well done, except the fight scenes, that follow the too edited, multi-angled, disorienting school of action that plagues so many action movies today.If you want you hipster friends to think you're smart then sure, pretend you like this movie, but as long as you keep that charade going Nolan is going to make more movies like this, and you're going to have to watch them and pretend you like them too, so why not take up chess instead, or learn how to solve the Rubik's cube?",Tenet

However, that may have been done on purpose as I have a theory on why they chose to do that, but I would have to watch it again to verify that (Honestly I may be thinking too hard at this point).The two things I loved about this film were the music and Robert Pattinson. The concept was also fine, and luckily for me I caught on for the most part, but somehow I left slightly dissatisfied/disappointed. Personally, I wasn´t too invested in David Washington´s ""protagonist"" or Debicki´s damsel in distress, which hurt the film a bit for me.

If he only made one movie as great as this he could live off the plaudits for the rest of his life. Without exception he has created half a dozen (if not everyone) works of art. He is transcendent. I've seen the Sistine chapel and it's impressive but what Nolan does is touched by God (and I don't believe in any of the man made religions!).I hope one day I can write something a tenth as good as a storyline as he's written here. It's flawless. If you don't get it just go and see it again.Oh and as for not being able to hear the odd word of dialogue do you really think this was an oversight?

1718,Luce1417,"The sound is awful, plot is bland.",1,15 August 2021,"Went to watch this move with high hopes. I'm a big fan of Nolan and Robbert. I was hoping for a inception type of movie and what we got was a very boring, pointless movie.First and the most important part. It was so hard to understand anything anyone was saying. The music was extremely loud and no one could hear the dialogue. It's hard to like a movie when you can't understand anything. We thought it was the theater but nope, same thing happened at home.Second, characters were bland. I care for no one. First time it happened to me in a Nolan film. Anyone could die and I could care less.Third, story was bleh. I don't know what he was trying to achieve but it's this one. It was for sure one of his worst movies.Overall I found this movie pretentious and boring. I don't like the Nolan got defensive about the sound as well. Fix your movie Nolan.",Tenet
1719,lord_orsum,A victim of its own cleverness,6,4 May 2021,"Christopher Nolan is a writer/director with big, bold, clever ideas. This has served him well from the brilliant, low-budget Memento through to the mind-bending, multi-dimensional Interstellar.However, while Tenet has a big, bold, clever idea, it doesn't really have a lot else. The set pieces are brilliantly done, technically flawless and very watchable, but there is something missing. That something is heart. The focus is so much on the clever idea, and the exposition around it, that there is little or no character development, emotion or engagement.So I found myself watching, enjoying the spectacle, but not really giving a damn about anyone or anything. And that really is a shame. The idea deserved a better vehicle to carry it. Not so clever, after all...",Tenet
1720,luiginastro,First viewing: a resounding no,5,30 August 2020,"I love Nolan. Interstellar was one of the more incredible cinematic experiences I've ever witnessed in a movie theater. I really, really, really didn't like this one.A good idea and the film stops there; it's just a good idea. The execution is visually thrilling, but story-wise is boring, with no clear goals (despite the seemingly endless exposition) and with almost no characters with enough characterization to care about. I found myself very disinterested, especially when all the bombastic action was happening and I had no idea what was happening, who was fighting who and who was inverted or not.
I've never agreed with all the usual criticisms people have been throwing around his previous films. I agree with them now, for this one; boring, pretentious and too much exposition, which in this case leads to nowhere. At least his previous endeavors had characters with some kind of depth to care about (except for Dunkirk, but that was kind of the point).
My last point of criticism is that the soundtrack's mixing is way too loud. I've never noticed this in his previous works, but oh boy, was it intrusive! I had a literal headache at the end.I'm sure you reading this will be thinking something in the vein of ""you just didn't understand it"" or ""you didn't pay enough attention"". Think whatever the hell you want; the movie simply didn't convey information clearly enough. That's on Nolan, not the audience. And with no character to attach to (you're not making abstract art, Nolan!), I couldn't find myself interested enough to decipher the supposed puzzle. On second viewing this may change, but for now that's how I feel.So, these are my impressions on first viewing. I'll surely watch it again, once it will be released on Blu Ray and/or VOD. For now, it's a 5,5/10.",Tenet
1721,wiac,Great one!,8,27 January 2021,"That movie is, to some extent, similar to Inception or Interstellar. The plot is based on certain supernatural device that makes the people to do impossible things (here we have the specific 'back in time' concept; in Inception we had sleeping device and in Interstellar - the black hole transport). These Cristopher Nolan's ideas are brilliant and they make us move to the world of action, thriller and mystery. Perhaps my imagination is not so well, but I confess that I had to watch this film twice to understand everything correctly. But, after that, I watched it for the third, fourth, fifth and... time - just to enjoy the artistic talents of Christopher Nolan and to drink in that fantastic movie.",Tenet

I feel like this movie has everything to be a great story. The concept of time being altered this way is great. I imagined a > for it to make sense, which helped me during the movie. The lower line is our reality moving forward, the line back is after an item or human switches time movement. Next to that there are great plot twists and lots of new concepts to explore within this world. It only has too much info and changes for only a movie in my opinion. If this was a series or a book viewers/readers could take their time to understand what was happening.

Even the basic speaking parts are rushed and confusing. And it's also quite odd in this regard - the director ( makes / has made ) INCREDIBLE blockbuster films ( in the past ) which I have thoroughly enjoyed and were 9 out of 10 or better. Just all around a profound waste of time watching it. I watched the entire movie and still don't actually understand what the main point of the movie even was.

The film was full of amazing action and lots of reverse footage trickery but I really felt like there was a lot of unnecessary complexity (and macguffin chasing!) which ended up just making the movie longer.
Time paradoxes aside, the one big thing I think the movie was missing is heart. In the days since I saw it I've mulled this over, thinking of the parent/child emotional cores of both Inception and Interstellar and Tenet just comes up hollow.

Neither did it ever makes, even though I tried to overlook some nonsense. Neither is it casted right, only David Washingon delivers, even though he seems lost in the plot himself. The twist don't hit because I never understood what was happening before the twist. The story of the woman and her villain husband is terribly thin and doesn't fit in a Nolan universe. And shockingly enough the directing isn't that good. I mean the car scene doesn't match the story told.

No I did not understand everything that was going on and much of the narrative and set pieces made little sense. This was not helped by insufficient exposition and a dialogue of mumbling by some of the lead actors.Many commentators have lauded the difficulty of understanding as a key positive of the film and multiple screenings are necessary. But hey why should that be the case? I also can enjoy opaque and elliptical movies - Last Year in Marianbad and Blow up, come to mind. But Tenet is not an arthouse movie and do filmmakers have some duty to their audiences?

It's kinda like trying to review The Matrix Project (trilogy and animatrix) after just seeing the first movie... clearly not enough and really unfair!!The score is awesome, the actors are impeccable, editing is outstanding (specially in a movie with so many ""moving parts""), photography is remarkingly competent and the phenomenal directing (and writing) stitches all together in a truly masterpiece kind of work that throws you a first punch to the gut, rolls you several times in a coming rumbling wave and in the end flabbergasts you into awe.

It's basically a time travel film but instead of disappearing from a specific point in time and reappearing at another, you just have to invert your self so that time goes backwards for you and then reinvert yourself and voila you have traveled back in time.So this is just a scifi film in which time is linear and it can be possible to just change the direction of its flow.Interstallar, that was a good movie, a 5 dimensional concept with non linear time and space concepts.Having said that I still think that Nolan's best film to date is Memento.",Tenet

However, Nolan knew cinema and audience. Though the movie is based On some complex theory, he replaces them with commercial elements like action , visuals . Yes Tenet stands more with this rather than the physics.
to reveal the story line, its again simple, a good man who wants to save the world from the badman. that's all it.
its real experience.. its real feeling..
watch it without a break, without a disturbance, you feel mesmerized.

1770,johny_walker_blacklabel,Don't watch it in a movie theater.,6,29 August 2020,"Now, I am a fairly smart guy and I've watched difficult films to grasp in the past with not many problems but I almost walked out of the movie theater because i couldn't fathom the main concept of the film. Only other movie I stopped before ending it because I didn't understand it was Primer. This is some Primer level mindboggling.Maybe even worse.
I recommend to the average viewer to either decide to watch it twice in the movie theate (and read some stuff about it before) or don't watch it at all and wait for it to become available and then watch it on your computer so that you can pause, think and maybe google some stuff to understand this film.
For example, I love Inception and I honestly believe that not too many people understood the level of complexity behind it in its entirety. But Inception's main concept and story was understood but most viewers. This is a different case. If you can't understand the concept even at a surface level you can't possibly enjoy the film. I think it's safe to say Nolan went too deep in his labyrinth mind and he non-apologetically created a film that doesn't take the right approach to explain it's convoluted concept to the viewer. If this wasn't directed by Nolan and people were honest, believe me it would have lower ratings. Walking out of the theater i heard most people saying they didn't understand anything. But you know many people don't want to sound dumb to their friends and theirselves, hence the rating. I am not saying this is a bad film. I am saying chances are you won't get it so beware spending your money and risking going to a movie theater (covid-19 aside).",Tenet

Just about none of it was even slightly believable, but I guess that's what Nolan is famous for, so be it. It couldn't even be classified as sci-fi; it's just stupid.

Thats it. He just thought of it and made this horrendous ""Science Fiction"" movie. Start to end..There's no proper plot to it. This movie is devoid of logic. But Still, There will be some Nolan fanboys that will claim that ""You didn't understand his vision; its upto viewers to decode and understand movie"" . I ASK WHY?? WHY audience should tie up the loose ends of film. Isnt that filmmakers job? Tomorrow, I'll make a movie with random scenes and call it a masterpiece saying its audience job to find the ""secret"" plot. Lol.

Please someone tell me the Tenet technology. I want my time and money back.",Tenet
1774,smanteufel,"Entertaining, but held back by Convoluted Storytelling",8,10 November 2020,"I'll start by saying I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, and even with only a semblance of understanding the plot as the credits hit the screen, I understood enough of the overarching story to enjoy the characters and their adventure without understanding the intricacies of how the plot really comes together.
Robert Pattinsons Acting was a highlight as well as certain scenes with 'reversing elements' so to speak.
There is however something to be said about a movie that 'challenges' it's audience to understand it, (often through multiple watches) and where some will think it's bold, others will think it's just rubbish.
Normally I would be inclined to the latter as I've always thought a truly great film: well written, directed and edited can only ever be just as good the second time around...
Films the likes of the Sixth Sense, Donnie Darko or even Nolan's own Inception have commonly been touted as films that get better the more you watch and understand, but I beg to differ, stating that the true brilliance of a film lies within its mystery and reveal. It's the tension and suspense on that first viewing that can never be replicated on further viewings. That is to say the removal of said suspense in lieu of noticing clever moments of foreshadowing in any other subsequent viewing belies the point of any foreshadowing in the first place.
I'm not saying there isn't an art to building a narrative in such a way that prior knowledge and hindsight can make subsequent viewings fun, but in a way these moments can't exceed an initial perception as they serve only to remind the viewer of their first watch, in effect bringing them back to the first time they watched it reigniting those same emotions they felt with a form of nostalgia.
The trouble with Tenet is that the first viewing experience is muddled and unclear. Only after sitting down with a pen and paper drawing out parallel and convergent timelines of multiple characters (it's just the one timeline actually) did I actually ""get"" the plot, and even then a quick read of reddit forums didn't hurt my understanding of the film.
What I'm saying is, I enjoyed this film...
It was rapidly paced and edited with some very impressive sequences, but it was also challenging from a narrative perspective to the degree that it was very nearly beyond my patience. So if this sort of film isn't your cup of tea I'd probably give this one a miss, but if Nolan's over-complication of story structure (that's become something of his oeuvre) doesn't bother you, then there is a compelling and interesting sci-fi story hidden underneath.",Tenet
1775,batiste-bieler,"Stylish, Soulless and too loud",5,28 December 2020,"Nolan forte is not character development or dialog... Really he should get some help with that... Or he is doing it on purpose? Not sure.The ""Protagonist"" is supposed to be a blank canvas for us to project ourselves into. At least this is what the painfully obvious name and lack of backstory would suggest. It doesn't quite work because the other characters need to be good to compensate but they are badly written and you do not know enough to care for them. You do not really want to be in his shoes interacting with those strange peoples as they act is caricatural and illogical ways. The world building and the concept might be interesting but this is not enough to drive a story.The whole journey lake something essential. And some idea feels really silly like the whole ""algorithm"" lego that looked like piece of cardboard props. What the heck what that?

1776,sj7075-292-151006,"An engaging film that holds your interest, that's as confusing as it is fast paced",6,3 December 2020,"Ok so the good.This movie has some great action scenes. It has some great scenes. It has a good sound track. Everyone plays a great part throughout this movie, and scripts are on point with the characters on display. Everything feels very well directed in the broad scale of elements.The Ok...This film is long, and a lot of scenes have been cut down or just removed to fit the edit. This is evident when in certain scenes you feel are flying by actually have 15/30 minutes in between when they're rellocated from the middle of a busy highway, to a dock warehouse in the next scene with the same characters. This is skimmed over badly to the point where one second they're in London, the next in a dessert. Given how crammed this movie is, its not a big deal, but makes the movie even harder to understand. The special FX or explosions in this case are a little over the top. Everything explodes with LOADS of FIRE, which makes it seem a bit cheap. Car's zipping along at highway speeds in reverse didn't make much sense. Some of the action scenes got very samey and a little tiring towards the end of the film, as it just gets reused the effects they keep using. Some of the characters are kinda weak, but are they minor or major? You don't know if you don't pay careful attention. You barely know there names either.The Bad...Well, if you miss a conversation in this film, you have to repeat it, or you won't understand the film. If anyone tells you they understood this film the first time, congratulations, you've found a liar. This film is incredibly confusing and between us 3 adult men aged between 35 - 53, none of us got it. You barely know characters names as they don't repeat them being introduced to X, Y and Z in the future. The volume of the music compared the dialogue is just a joke. It just feels like in every action scene when the music gets all intense, you can't even hear what the characters are saying. This happens, OVER AND OVER again. It's only about 3/4 of the way through the film we learn what the entire point of the film is all about, as everything until then has just been background filler. The last 1/4 of the film felt so squeezed in, it has some horrible cliche's a film of this calibre just should have had.To note, I really hated Inception, but I found this movie a little easier to like. Still had much the same nagging points though, like an overly complex story for a very simple premise of a movie. This is revealed much to late through the movie, where half the movie has past and just isn't really relevant after. The music, was just too loud against the volume of the characters. You're left with more questions than answers after the movie, and much of it is never even touched on, or at least I missed the conversation they had explaining it, because a pin dropped in the room, and I couldn't hear it over the deafening music playing throughout the movie. The cliche's at the end of the movie, yeeah I thought that was a weak twist to such a movie.",Tenet
1777,andrew_clure,Confusing. Terrible sound,1,10 April 2021,"What on Earth was that I just watched? First, sound quality is awful. Truly terrible, to the point where subtitles are needed to hear what's being said. Considering it's such a complicated concept, that's just unacceptable.Second, there's just nothing to get you involved with the characters. Who are they? Other Nolan films use time tricks but it's easy to understand as you 'get' the characters (everyone understands dreams seemingly lasting hours but it's only been 5 minutes. Or even time dilation at a black hole and a fathers desire to get home to his kids).Here though, why does the Russian want to destroy history?? It may have been explained, but the sound quality is so, so bad that I probably missed it and I'm not watching it all again with subtitles. That's just one hole, but they are everywhere and I'm not sure if it's poor storytelling or the awful sound responsible for me missing it.One of the worst films I've seen but could have been at least a 4 or 5/10 if I'd actually heard what people were saying.",Tenet

This one is practically just one big scam. It would have you believe that you have to watch it twice to fully get it, and when you do it'll be mindblowing. And if you still don't get it after multiple viewings, then it means you're just not smart enough. Well, no. The only thing that watching this movie several times will do is point out all the plot holes that make the story actually incoherent.
It's as if Nolan felt he had a great idea that he really wanted to exploit but couldn't manage to make it go anywhere so he buried it under layers and layers of confusion so we wouldn't notice. The result is a movie that's like a puzzle which, once you put the pieces together, shows a picture that makes no sense.

1783,r-i-p_333,"Brief, Non-Spoiler review",9,22 August 2020,"As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores.",Tenet

1797,knighttanker,Nolan's Bond Movie - a real thinker,10,4 September 2020,"I've seen the movie more than a week ago but was too lazy and speechless to write anything.
Firstly, most of Tenet is confusing as hell, especially on the first watch so if you can watch the movie at least twice. Some scenes are really fast-paced and would require some pauses but hey, if you went to the cinema you can count that option out. Both Washington and Pattinson do an amazing job throughout the movie and it's always refreshing to see Sir Michael Caine appear on screen. I've seen many comparisons to Inception pre-premier and I would say that it differs in a lot of things. Tenet is much more complex and harder to understand than any of
Nolan's previous works, although I see this as neither a good nor a bad thing. The movie is basically split into two parts or halves and the first section is near impossible to completely understand. As expected in Nolan's films, you get your answer(s) at the end, kind of. The story felt a bit dragged at some places, however the viewer has to pay very close attention through the entire film because if you miss even just 3-5 seconds you're out of the picture. It's like you're forced to be captivated. The last part of the film feels way better as you start to comprehend what has happened in the past hour and half. Most of the movie is practical and includes some really amazing stunts and action that can both please and confuse the viewer even more so.

Not showing some actors the full script or making sure they didn't understand the plot to ensure they didn't know how to deliver the lines4.

1829,azahmed-03750,Visually stunning but very confusing,6,8 October 2020,I thought this was incredible to watch from a visual point of view in the cinema. But I found the storyline very confusing and will probably need another watch to catch all the little details. My biggest issue was with the sound. The sound of the action almost burst my eardrums and then the dialogue was muffled and completely unintelligible. The scene on the catamaran was such a waste because I couldn't hear a word of what anyone was saying. Might have to wait for it to come out on streaming and turn the subtitles on.,Tenet
1830,olleyy,A great Nolan film. One you will be able to rewatch over and over down the line.,9,19 December 2020,"I watched the movie at the cinema and I have to agree with basically everyone else reviewing this movie, the sound in the cinema was off, maybe way off (maybe they mixed it using AirPods on their laptops during lockdown :D ).
A lot of the time it was extremely hard to decipher what was going on and didn't help with following the storyline. I think my cinema played it way too loud though. But in the end, I came out and had great discussions on the mind-bending story and enjoyed it a lot, although my ears may not have.The set is honestly amazing, and the acting by John David Washington & Kenneth Branagh was awesome, however, I've got to hand it to Robert Pattinson and for me, he was the star of it all. The composing by Ludwig Göransson was incredible as well! It brought everything to life, especially while experiencing it in the cinema.I ended up re-watching the movie at home with subtitles, and this is what I would highly recommend for anyone watching this. The cinema experience is unbeatable, but if you want to understand what characters are saying and be able to follow the story well watching at home with subs is a no brainer.I think the reason why so many people are reviewing it badly and saying things like ""I'm confused"" & ""it's hollow"" is because they haven't understood the movie yet. In my opinion, maybe Nolan wanted people to watch it more than once, maybe he made it for you to be confused on the first watch, and maybe this one sets up for a sequel. I don't know about you, but aren't the best movies are ones you can continue to watch and uncover more layers over time?
There are a lot of haters (or people who still don't get it), but I honestly think this was a great mind-bending movie with a super complex storyline that you only really understand with either more research or by watching it again (and again). Wait until you get the ""oh now I get it"" moment.",Tenet

The Action in the film was really Amazing and unique. Kenneth Branagh did a great performance in the film and I really loved the Robert Pattinson character. John David Washington was so cool in the film. The interconnectedness of the characters was great. Nolan ensured that we can't change the past, but can affect on it. At the end, I liked the movie.

1835,TheFlashyRedCat,Newest entry from master of time,8,19 January 2021,"Christopher Nolan is mostly known for his sci-fi-thrillers, which question the definition of time, such as ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"" and ""Memento"". In his newest film, he reinvents the genre and does something completely new.""Tenet"" is about a man, who discovers, that the present is getting attacked by the future, because objects and persons travelling backwards through time will destroy the world. We follow the story of an unnamed agent (John David Washington), who tries to stop the middleman, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). On his way, he discovers more and more about this hidden war, accompanied by Neil (Robert Pattinson).While ""Tenet"" uses a new technology to invert entropy to travel backwards through time, an early film of Nolan, ""Memento"", was told just like that, backwards. Tenet shines in the background, mostly in the sequences, where the protagonist travels backwards and everything around him moves forward. Those effects were PERFECT. Another great thing is the choreographies. At some point inverted people fight with non-inverted people, but it's all without CGI. These fights were handmade, which looks way more convincing, than some CGI-action-movie.I have to admit, that you have to watch it more than once, because every time you realize something new, which is in my opinion a great way, to keep audiences interested, because ""Tenet"" has soo many mysteries, that we want to be solved. Who is the protagonist? Who is Neil? Who is anybody?There is one thing, I didnt like: We dont get a pause. The plot goes on and on, action sequence after action sequence, never time to breath or think about what happened. Some people might get frustrated by this.So, 9/10, because Nolan is one of few directors, who can just make anything a masterpiece and a well-thought movie, while still being thrilling, exciting and innovational.",Tenet

1837,tsunder-36663,"Incredible cinema, Nolan does it again",10,17 September 2020,"As a massive, long-time fan of Christopher Nolan films, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this film. The pandemic pushed this films release back several months which only added to the anticipation, as well as the high expectations. I can honestly say that what he's released here is nothing short of cinematic magic. After the first viewing I was completely confounded by what I had seen. I knew I enjoyed the film and had an amazing experience, but I had so many questions that I didn't even know where to start. I was able to superficially understand the plot and have an appreciation for it, but there was so much underlying substance and nuance to unpack that I knew I needed at least two viewings to really appreciate it. If you're looking for rich character development you won't find it here. This film essentially moves between highly fervid action sequences which are masterfully done, and sharp exposition that attempts to explain the plot and mechanics by which this world operates within. I will admit that there are times in which the score beats you over the head with blaring intensity and you find yourself struggling to hear the dialogue, but for the most part it's absolutely amazing and adds to the experience in a dazzling way. Make no mistake, this film is tedious and mind-bending, but the pay-off makes it all worth it in the most classic Nolan way. Just be prepared to mentally go to work when you watch this film. Either way, Nolan continues to break ground with his trend of highly ambitious and ground-breaking cinema combined with excessively commercial and accessible at the same time.",Tenet
1838,bonfire_64,"A great film, but not everyone can appreciate its beauty",8,8 March 2021,"As a huge Christopher Nolan fan, I was very excited about Tenet's release. The $200-million production delivered brilliant special effects, great cinematography and film editing and decent performances. The story is interesting but really complicated, and requires multiple watches to fully understand what's going on. Many people criticised the lack of emotional connection between the audience and the characters. However, the fact that the Protagonist remains anonymous, makes it obvious that Nolan is not aiming to makes us feel familiar with him. Personally, I noticed some emotion between Kat and the Protagonist, so I think that the film has indeed a hidden heart. I have heard a lot of complaints about the sound mixing, but I had no problem with it since I was watching with Greek subtitles. I respect the editors' decision to make the score sounds louder, especially since the music is perfect as far as I'm concerned.To sum up, I believe the film is original, well-crafted and ahead of its time. However, it is not a moviegoing experience that everybody will enjoy, and I understand why people may not like it.",Tenet
1839,banelekunene-77917,IF I COULD RATE IT A 100 I WOULD!!!!!,10,28 August 2020,"Firstly Washington and Patterson mind blowing acting from both. I always doubted Patterson however after that his got it. It just came out today I'm South Africa and I had to watch it. I must say I stayed away from all reviews or theories and I'm glad. The movie is excellent; from acting, scenery, relationships, and plot it's just simply a masterpiece. The music is a definite highlight the character's emotions and feelings are transferred to the viewer. The movie is deceptive I don't want to spoil however everything is right in front of you - another HUGE WIN is that the audience and the main character (WASHINGTON- what a performance) have the same knowledge. What he knows you knows, what he is confused about you are confused about, and what he learns you learn - it all happens in real time. I've never felt so engaged and attached to a movie. There's so much to say however every single individual in this movie production or movie was excellent. The concept of inversion is simply mind boggling- truly it is mind blowing stuff. I'd say pay attention but Nolan and the characters will have your full attention. So I definitely recommend you don't bother streaming off some website and go pay to watch this movie. Honestly it's worth paying for, the amount of quality in this movie is exceptional. So as Nolan said "" Don't try understand it, feel it..."". Forget the bad reviews or whatever this movie transcends so much. I'm not one to write reviews but this movie is incredible- it's not a money grabber or money driven. It's about art as just wow. Best movie I've seen- I'd say for me it's now number one. Thank you to Nolan, actors, and everyone who brought this masterpiece to life.",Tenet

1847,cole_groth,Yet another Nolan masterpiece.,10,9 September 2020,"For my first movie in a real theater since Knives Out, I got the cinematic pleasure of watching Tenet. I am proud to say that Christopher Nolan has not lost any of his talent, and it shows in every single shot of this film. Just like Momento, the story slowly unfolds, with more pieces of the puzzle fitting together as the story moves forwards (and backwards, it's hard to explain.). What Nolan does best is his complex use of time travel, or more accurately, time reversal. Our protagonist, only billed as ""Protagonist"", is brought into an organization known as ""Tenet"", tasked with stopping World War 3.The film is intentionally vague about it's plot, which mirrors the limited information that our protagonist is told at first. Many details that happen early on in the movie get explored later, such as a car flipping over, backwards. We later see that our protagonist was driving this car, but in the ""Inverse"" state. The time reversal slowly makes more sense, and it all culminates in an extremely fun battle scene where two sides of the same army have to fight off an enemy, both in the normal time zone and the inverse time zone.The sound design sells this film, and every music score makes the film much more than just a movie. I have to address the most gaping issue in the movie: the sound mixing. Just like most of Nolan's movies, the overbearing sound effects often drown out the character's dialogue. In a movie like this, it's a much bigger issue when the plot is so convoluted. This will certainly be a huge issue for many viewers, but I honestly had a pretty easy time understanding the story, and didn't need subtitles.
It's a total cinematic experience. Every actor sells their performance, especially John David Washington and Robert Pattinson (very excited to see him in the future!). The effects are absolutely stunning, and I'm sure that Nolan's insistence on using practical effects came in handy when making each action scene look authentic as possible. The story is intentionally hard to follow, but it shows nothing less than the complete mastery of its genre by Nolan. This is the most fun that I have had watching a movie in a long time. I will be recommending Tenet to every respecting filmmaker in the future, and I am happy to see that this is what the theaters are opening up to around the world.",Tenet

1854,vchung-05758,A mind-bending rollercoaster of temporal thrills,7,21 January 2021,"Tenet is an action science-fiction thriller, the latest film directed by acclaimed director Christopher Nolan. It stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, and Kenneth Branagh. Nolan staple actor Michael Caine also shows up briefly in a small but delightfully witty role.The film centers on an unnamed CIA agent (played to cold perfection by Washington) who is recruited into a secret organization to help stop an upcoming apocalyptic event. This seems like typical action-thriller fare, but leave it up to Christopher Nolan to add in a mind-numbing caveat: time inversion. It turns out that a villainous businessman (played by Branagh) has obtained bullets and items that travel backwards through time, and is attempting to assemble a weapon that could destroy the past, and the protagonist must stop him, with the help of fellow agent Neil (played by a very suave Pattinson). Over the course of the film, we see various events from different perspectives, both in normal time and inverted, backwards time, and it is not until later in the film, or even towards the very end, that those events will have their true significance revealed. Basically, the film throws a lot at you in the opening hour, but all of the questions you may have will be largely answered by the film's end, giving plenty of ""Aha!"" moments.One of the highlights of the film are the performances of Washington, Pattinson, Debicki, Branagh. Washington plays an ice-cold professional, laser-focused on his mission, equally a capable field agent and keeping a cool head during negotiations and unexpected situations. Pattinson's character Neil is no less a professional, but is a bit more witty than the comparatively serious CIA agent. Their characters' constant back-and-forth and general delightful chemistry provides a great deal of entertainment throughout the film. Branagh's villain Sator is gloriously over-the-top in his lines, yet delivers every line with a chilling effectiveness. However, all of those performances can feel a little one-note, existing as vehicles to propel the story forward, without much character development and coming off as cold and detached in spite of the engaging dialogue. Debicki's character Kat, on the other hand, has a simple yet relatable motivation: escaping from Sator's control. She gets a timely and understated character arc of finding the strength to escape from her abuser on her own initiative. This gradual development of Kat's character makes her feel that much more three-dimensional than many of the other characters in the film, who largely exist specifically to fill a certain role in the plot.The film is amazingly shot, with a lot of attention to detail, with the sequences of time inversion invoking a sense of wonder and subtle uneasiness even though it does not make use of excessive computer-generated effects. The same goes for the action sequences. Yes, many of the action sequences and stunts were done with completely practical effects, and the effects of inversion is accomplished by playing footage backwards. It is all done so cleverly that you can easily find yourself on the edge of your seat during the intense action, both when they are seen in normal time, and when they are inverted. The editing is smooth, so the complex action and time inversion sequences can be followed with minimal difficulty.The soundtrack is also superb, with Ludwig Göransson filling in for longtime Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer. The score gives a lot of gravitas to every scene, no matter if it is an action scene, a quiet dramatic scene, or a tense negotiation scene. The sounds throughout the film provide a real sense of immersion into the world of the film. However, one complaint I have regarding the sound is that many loud sounds can be a little too loud, and can occasionally drown out important dialogue.Tenet is an exciting thrill ride from start to finish, with a suitably twist-filled time-bending plot, exciting action sequences, and a fantastic score, bolstered by engaging performances, an emotional arc for Debicki's character, and awe-inspiring visuals. Even though the sound can be a bit too loud at times and many characters may be somewhat one-note, Tenet is undeniably an extremely entertaining film well worth your time.",Tenet

1856,ghbarratt-1,Ridiculously reality and physics ignorant and inconsistent while desperately trying to appear smart,3,26 September 2020,"The movie was a bad science fiction trying to be an action movie. The concepts and physics/reality-bending rules that are established by the movie are broken all over the place. The movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever even if you try to suspend your critical thinking. I got the strong impression that they wanted to make a movie with an original idea and they recognized that the idea of ""objects"" (including) people moving backwards in time would be hard for people to just accept, so instead of making it as believable as possible, by limiting the use of the concept to as little as necessary, the writers of this film did the opposite; They double-down on the false science, claiming that fiery explosions will give someone moving backwards hypothermia, and people moving backwards cannot breath normal air but can do just fine with a non-air-tight oxygen mask, for example. I can't help but think the writers and director were hoping that by making the reality-bending rules so complicated, that it would cause the audience to not question any of it. It really came off as: ""this movie is too smart for you to get, so just stop trying to think about it. You are too stupid to get it.""

Used to be my fav director.His story telling became extremely frustrating and he seem to not trust audience anymore with his constant exposition and it became a meme at this point.People are not daft you can tell complex time travel stories like in netflix dark if told right.Editing is all over the place and sound mix is horrible and u need to subtitles to understand wtf they are saying. But then u will miss out of his great cinematography.I was so dissapointed with this movie when i came out of theatre i wanna give it 1/10 but i gotto admit his cinematogrphy is amazing and i give one start for it.

Fell asleep 3x, rewinded, realized the rewinding was a waste of time and decided to just turn it off with about 20 minutes of show left. I have no desire to learn how the movie ended.My summary of the movie: Black dude with impressive beard wears fancy suits and does some random action scenes that always end with you trying to figure out just why the heck that just made sense to someone to put it into a movie.

1862,IFism,Ultimately terrible,1,2 December 2020,"This is like someone (Nolan) was joking and decided to spend 205.000.000$ on the crappiest scenario ever.
There is honestly nothing worth seeing in this movie. The picture is nice, but far from impressive. The story lacks convincing in every possible aspect and is utterly ridiculous. The originality? If you call stupidity original, then perhaps yes.
Let's see some stuff (if I still remember, since it's been more than a couple of weeks since I've watched this horrible, horrible movie):
1. The scientist invented a weapon that can wipe out the world, and then regretted it, so instead of destroying it, she divides it into several parts (artifacts) that she hides in the past, scattered around the world, and apparently together with the description and instructions describing what it is and how to reassemble the device. Seriously?! That's the best she could do?!?!
2. When people travel through time they need their own oxygen, but only in several scenes do they have the pipes and oxygen bag, while in most others they don't.
3. Things a time-traveler is using move backwards when in the past, but the person moves normally.
4. The highlight is the saying - not knowing is your greatest advantage?!?! Well, it did strike me on more than one occasion the script was written by a complete idiot.
5. One man is collecting the artifacts in order to destroy the world because he has cancer and wants the whole world (including his son) gone with him.
6. The protagonist is supposed to reach a powerful and well-guarded man who lives in a penthouse at the top of the building and whom no commoner saw in a long, long time. Two men get in and out of the place easily and without any problem. Just like that. Later on, the wife of that man (who is actually the one pulling strings) is freely walking among the city market, with less than a minimal number of security guides around her.
7. They can travel in time, but could not organize the final action better, without a terrible and pointless action where so many people died.
8. Eventually they retrieve all the artifacts, then again, instead of destroying them, they decide to hide them somewhere. C'mon!?!?! Why didn't they just killed the antagonist in the first place and left the originally hidden artifacts stay hidden where they were, if the whole point was simply to hide them again?!
There are probably far more ridiculously stupid moments, inconsistencies and gaps, throughout this 2.5 hours long agony of a movie.
There are so many good books in the world, and surely good scenarios - why is so much money spent on something so ultimately bad as is Tenet?!",Tenet

1865,kikogod,Good but very confusing!,7,6 June 2021,"Extremely hype about Nolan's new film, as well as my first time going to the movies since March, what could go wrong? Well, frankly, a lot and a little. Tenet is a good movie, I liked it, very dynamic, a lot more action than almost anything Nolan did, and it held tension, and I barely felt its bombastic duration of 150 minutes. But, (it's time for the on-duty ""but"") - If you love Nolan because of his typical flirtations with the laws of time, space and physics, and the interesting way he handles them, I have to tell you that the dude cranked the twist to 11. This, with my hand on my heart, I can say is both one of his most basic structured films and perhaps the most complex he has ever made.Honestly, from the middle onwards, I had almost no idea what was going on, I was totally confused and it was extremely difficult for me to follow all the twists and turns that were pouring in waves from the screen. I will not say exactly what it is about, but the idea is a manipulation of time - past and future. In a typical Nolan style, the man has tried his best to show us his new idea from all sorts of points of view, events, as much as possible tangled and twisted. Apart from the fact that we, as viewers, have the difficult task of following what is happening and explaining how the mechanics that the director presents to us work, well, this whole thing is based on a supposedly basic and simple, but complicated basis. From characters, countertops, layers, etc., which at least to me personally, further burdened me, to the point where by the end I was already honestly wondering what else can he stuff in the flick, this madlad. Indeed, a very complex film, with many levels, explanations and entanglements from the past and the future that are too stressful. I would definitely need a 2nd, even a 3rd viewing to understand everything, but at least for now I don't have that desire.And despite all the complexity, the characters are quite superficially presented, and some even have almost no development and things just happen to them. Also, the narrative itself suffers a bit of criticism, because the action often jumps from scene to scene, just like that, with some minimal explanation, and ""the madness begins."" It's like ticking levels in a game one after another. The main character was strange to me, and I could not get into his shoes, although the actor is not bad. Pattinson is good enough for what he has as material and I have no criticism of him, but in general he is not very memorable. I would define the music as positive, because there were a lot of nice inspiring and bombastic at times themes that built tension quite well, but I can criticize there as well, because at times it was too much and there were too long segments where the music just boomed and it rumbled, and was too repetitive.In summary, I can say that Tenet is a relatively good film, with a few strong twists, but overall very overdone and unnecessarily complicated. Even visually it wasn't something, that impressive, except for a few very nice scenes with the return of time (which element also was a little too much and). It left me with an overall positive impression, but very heavy and stressful to watch, especially towards the end!Rating: 6.5 / 10.",Tenet

So once again with Tenet, he delivers a completely unique and original story.Out of all Christoper Nolan's movies, this one is the most ""Christopher Nolan"". Nolan continues to use time as a driving point of a film. The film starts out running and does not stop, so sit back and just take in what you can. As the film progresses, more and more of the story starts to click in your mind, but you may never fully pick up everything until after it is over.I personally didn't know how I felt about Tenet once the film finished, but I knew I was extremely engaged. The film has terrific action and a wonderful score by Ludwig Göransson. All of the acting is great, especially by John David Washington and Robert Pattinson. My biggest complaint with the film is the sound mixing in it. There are many moments throughout the movie where the score and sound effects overpower the dialogue, which makes the movie more confusing than it already is. With that being said, it's been almost three days now since I saw it, and I can't stop thinking about the movie.I feel quite confident that during the release of the film, it will be quite divisive, with some people hating it and others loving it.

Sound - fail. Complicated rapid-fire dialogue that you can barely hear. Soundtrack is nice though.
Execution... complete failure in my books. I don't want to have to watch the same movie 3+ times in a row to maybe understand what happened. Truth be told, if you watched it multiple times it probably still wouldn't make sense and you'd end up going down an infinite rabbit hole.

Confusing not because it's hard to understand but because it was meant to be this way. People getting upset over it is funny.

Well no, that's not the way I like to watch movies, sometimes I accept that (Memento was definitely better the second time) but in this case it's just pretentious.

Despite its sophistication, it has nothing really interesting to say about our existential, cultural, or political conditions. But because of its complicated plot and high concept, a lot can be said about it that will make one sound smart.Like many other Nolan films, it takes a set of interesting premises about time, technology, consciousness, and physics, and, instead of questioning or subverting them, runs with it and constructs an elaborate story out of it.For what it is, it's exhilarating and entertaining, and not a bad theatre experience after many months of quarantine.",Tenet

I really hope that Warner Bros green-lights this movie as a trilogy for Christopher Nolan to direct because I believe that this movie could have the same impact as the Matrix if it receives more explanation as to how a person can "" time-travel"" as the young woman I went to see the movie with: she calls it.

In parts it's utter gibberish, poor dialogue, tedious, the characters are paper thin with little to no development, and the audience is given nothing to care about...nothing in the entire 2.5 hours.

1881,kookoo36,"""Tenet"" is Christopher Nolan's James Bond movie",7,26 May 2021,"First off, I think this movie was harmed a little bit by the advertising campaign. The commercials made Tenet seem like a science fiction thriller, but it's really not at all. People have been asking Christopher Nolan for years to direct a James Bond movie, and we've never had a definitive answer from him as to whether or not he would do it. Until now.That's right - THIS is Christopher Nolan's take on the ""007"" story.When viewed in this way, Tenet makes perfect sense. I wouldn't be surprised if Nolan actually wrote this as a Bond movie initially, and the studios rejected the concept for being too ""out there"" (which it is, but in a good way). Or maybe he just decided he would have more freedom if he made it into his own story, leaving the Protagonist nameless.Here are a few reasons I believe this to be the case:1. The Protagonist is a stylish and suave secret agent with an unknown past
2. The villain is an over-the-top power hungry billionaire with a ridiculous accent who wants to destroy the world
3. Crazy gadgets and technology all throughout
4. The finale is very similar to a few older ""Bond"" films, specifically ""Moonraker""I found that I really enjoyed the film when I viewed it with this in mind.

It can't really start, because the premise is so unintuitive, that it needs to be reasserted and explained literally every second, to make it all hold together.The concept that you'll have to accept is that time can move in two directions at once, more specifically things like bullets and cars can move backwards while the rest of stuff move forwards. Well, that's just stupidly convenient for an action film, wouldn't you say? Well, it won't stop Nolan from spending the rest of your evening trying to convince you it somehow makes perfect sense.And here I thought the purpose of exposition was to set the premise so the actual story can start.

The movie, Christopher Nolan rewards them.I thought this was done on purpose. Knowing how Nolan likes to push the boundaries of what is viewed normal in film making.

I risk sounding pedantic, but being a sci-fi fan and familiar with concepts of overlapping timelines and time travel, I had no problem following (or at times predicting) the complex story that Nolan masterfully penned and directed for our amazement. Movies like Primer, Memento and Predestination have touched on the subject of multiple viewpoints across an self intersecting looped timeline or split editing before, but Nolan has just raised the bar to an insane level on a fast paced, action packed, intelligent film that deserves multiple views.

1891,sean3240,Christopher Nolan just keeps getting worse,2,1 February 2021,"This film distracts the audience by making them try to work out it's literal events. And when they get satisfaction from that, they forget to think about the fact the plot has no purpose or deeper meaning.Although it's not new to Nolan movies, the amount of exposition had gone completely over the top. Most conversations were clearly only there to propel the plot forward and didn't make sense coming from those characters.I found it to be technically perfect, but everything else (structure, pacing, characters, story engagement, dialogue, meaning) was done so poorly. This diminishes the effect the quality of these technical achievements have because they then feel completely meaningless.While I still paid attention, I lost any small amount of interest I had in the story around the end of the second act, this was where my lack of care for direction of plot and characters was cemented, as I was watching what should've been an amazing and technically brilliant action sequence that I was just waiting for to be over.So many underdeveloped plot points and character moments were presented as significant despite the lack of impact they have. This is the worst thing I think a movie can do as it's blatant what it wants you to feel and you are absolutely not feeling it. This especially included some scenes with Kenneth Branagh which I couldn't help but laugh at.What were clearly supposed to be high tension scenes to be taken seriously played out comedically as I simply did not care about Russian Kenneth Branagh or his wife, nor did the movie attempt to make me care prior to these scenes which could've greatly benefited from more feel of character.Characters motivations and a care for consequences of risks were lost. It's something I find Inception did a lot better in still having the puzzle of its plot, but there was care for the characters, reasons for their actions and still something to connect with emotionally afterwards.The best thing this movie does is trick idiots into thinking it's smart.

This film combines not only a complex idea with inversion (which is not nearly as complicated as I was thinking it would be. Just make sure ""you don't try to understand it... feel it"") But a complex story telling structure. Where Nolan reveals only what he wants you to know on his time. From a film making standpoint this has it all, acting across the board, cinematography, paralyzing score, incredible realistic action. It is a movie that will require multiple viewings, but don't let its complexity scare you away from the film. For those who do not seek a complex movie, you can still be thoroughly entertained with John David Washington and Robert Pattinson's charm as well as the incredible visual masterpiece that unfolds before your eyes.SPOILER SECTIONThose who have seen the movie. YOU MUST see it at least twice. At first watch the film seemed to lack the emotional gut-punch that Inception had. But the relationship between the protagonist and Neil, although a bit weak upon first viewing, EXPLODES during multiple viewings. ""You don't drink on the job"" ""I'll see you in the beginning, friend."" The minor pieces of dialogue carry the most amount of weight in the film. And Nolan does this because we see the film from the point of view of the protagonist, who at the time, really doesn't know anything. Every time I saw it (I saw it four times :)) I picked up on something new. Which is why this is one of my favorite Nolan films.

So many characters served no real purpose and were a waste of screen-time. And the motivations of the characters were completely absent, it was totally unconvincing. Why did the scary Russian man want to destroy the world? cause he had cancer and was sad?? really? Why did the main protagonist want to save the woman so bad? There was no connection or chemistry, at the start of the film he tells the other agent he would take women and children hostage if he needed to, setting him up as a ruthless character, yet halfway through the film he compromises his mission, the object and information to save a woman he has no connection with, so I guess its cause he's a good guy right?

2-Both movies started with explanations and training somebody about how to do the main mission of the movie.
3-Both movies the main character tried to have a crew to do the mission.
4-Also both movies the characters traveled a lot from different countries around the world
5-the enemy are rich in both of them as well
6-both movies has a main character who they can't leave someone ( Dicaprio with his wife in Inception, and the blonde woman with her Ukrainian husband ) and both of them killed the person who they can't leave at the end of the movie.And alsooo there are a looot of things I can mention
What I can guess is this movie is a anniversary celebration for Nolan masterpiece Inception after 10 years.

It's a shame to see so many viewers bashing this movie just because they didn't understand it.

It's like a puzzle to piece together and i definitely recommend multiple viewings which I will need as well and I'm fine with that. This is truly a breathtaking film, a love letter to sci fi and old school espionage/ lovers of the Christopher Nolan esque action scenes... the score is legendary albeit wasted in some scenes imo.

1911,cedricdumler,"NOLAN DOES IT AGAIN. A mind-blowing, brain-bending masterpiece!",10,1 February 2021,"'TENET' is a mind-blowing experience. The way Christopher Nolan separates the inverted world and the regular world is incredibly well organized, even towards the end where all the action comes together like nerve cells of a brain. Also, tying the protagonist's story to Kat's in a way that doesn't feel forced or out of place is a great testament to Christopher Nolan as a writer. If anything, these two stories complement each other so much that it heightens the experience.The opening scene will go down as one of the best in history. Christopher Nolan is known for his terrific openings, especially in the legendary ""Dark Knight"" opening scene. TENET"" is in no way inferior to that - and after watching it several times, I'd even argue that it's better! The score by Ludwig Göransson is masterful and brilliantly composed. The outstanding composer, who has previously worked on ""Creed,"" ""The Mandalorian"" and ""Black Panther,"" reaches a new level of compositional perfection here. The action set-pieces gave it a sense of adrenaline. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself.One of my criticisms of Christopher Nolan is that in most of his films, the action set pieces and the editing of that action leave something to be desired. With Tenet, Nolan threw all of my past criticism out the window. The complexity of the individual action scenes was at an insanely high level, the editing of the individual fight scenes was breathtaking.John David Washington is brilliant as the protagonist. He has the charisma and intelligence of what Christopher Nolan was trying to achieve with the character. This man has a bright future ahead of him.When Robert Pattinson is on screen, his and John David Washington's presence demands attention. That's the job of a supporting actor. To enhance the performance of the lead actor while highlighting your own strengths in the film so that you get noticed by the audience. Robert did that in a masterful way.Kenneth Branagh is great as antagonist Andrei Sator, only surpassed by the incredible Elizabeth Debicki, who continues to amaze in her roles. What a woman.TENET is a film that deserves your full attention, which means no cell phones, no talking, and no eating, because if you lose focus, you will get lost. This film is verging perfection. From Nolan's brilliant script to the sensational acting performances by John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki to the unprecedented action set pieces, the masterful score by Ludwig Göransson and the fantastic editing by Jennifer Lame.Nolan has once again revealed to us the inexhaustible power of film.
Thanks for that.",Tenet

1913,pufflingpants,As bad as it can get,1,15 December 2020,"Well, where to start. Story - there is none - because it's the same old, lame story told a million times - and actually this terrible story was told better before a thousand times. So we have the male driven hero crap, the violent husband villain, the supposedly beautiful woman who cannot help herself but only be a mother and the hero who has to save the world and for some reason feels the need to save the woman (even if they have absolutely no connection) and prioretizes saving her before saving the world, but of course - he does both. It's misogynistic crap, but as said, this crap has been told better before. You don't believe any of the actors their role, the dialogue is so lazy, so cliché, so bad. Ah yes, then the ""action"" - cars driving backwards - great. I have to admit I was appalled after watching this for ten minutes, but stayed, - had little naps but apparently didn't miss anything. This movie is an insult of the intelligence of people. Don't bother with the time-loop-thingy, isn't worth it. The only time I chuckled was when the actress playing the wife of the villain sitting in the back of the car whilst it was driving alone reached with her foot to the front to open the door. I mean, that's why she was cast - those long legs. Why anybody else was there, I don't know, but I guess even an actor/director like Branagh doesn't always care and just takes the money- because he knew what he was getting into. I went to see this movie because I Iiked Inception. What a let down.",Tenet
1914,lfonetedc,Overly complicated and pretentious,7,28 August 2020,"I had been excited to see this movie coming out and went to see the movie today.....and I am disappointed.The story is extremely complex without any clear explanation. The time travel concept is not that difficult to understand, but with the elements of the movie, it becomes like the modules we learn when we are pursuing a Doctor's degree. If there were a test for this movie, I would get a D. The cinematography and score are still at the same level, but the storytelling is the worst compared to every Nolan's films. The movie is long, so I was waiting for a more comprehensive explanation, but there is none. It's like the characters did whatever they wanted without telling you their motives and why they did it, and sometimes a few concepts seemed contradictory to what we learned in the first place.If you want to comprehend the whole movie, you need to rent a DVD after it is released, pause it every 10 minutes, discuss with your friends and family, get the most convincing conclusion, and continue it will take you a lot of time to fully accept the core concept of the movie and be convinced.",Tenet

This movies is for people who love his other movies like Inception and Interstellar that will get you think heavily and require many viewings to understand it fully. Also more viewings will help you notice the little hints through out the movie. The acting is amazing with Washington and Pattinson both being incredible with great chemistry. Pattinson will make a great Batman after this. Action in the movie is of course incredible with time being used extremely cleverly during these fight scenes. My only issues with the film are with the characters you do not know much about any of them and some of the music is so loud it can be hard to hear conversations.This is a film that you do not want miss at the theater.

I'm not even going to bother with a proper review, but the first like 2 minutes were enough for me. This team of americans is to run in with the russians and are handed a badge from the selection of like 5 different ones. K but they all have they exact same gear? They pump gas into a random vent and everyone immediately starts passing out. That doesn't exist. Every if there were a gas that could knock people out within seconds, the bloody theatre is huge. They would need tons of the stuff. Then, my favourite stupid hollywood gun bs. Dude asks a guy for a code word and when he doesn't answer right away he charges his gun to really drive the point home. So he ran into this crazy hostage situation without loading his gun? Nolan loves to do these big grandiose idea pictures, but never bothers with any of details.

Went to see John and Robert in a film, assumed it has to be great despite what's being seen on the screen. It's quite slow paced, nor suspenseful and hated the sound mixing, too loud, unable to hear the dialogues due to that is just unforgivable.People are giving 10/10 ratings and praises, ignoring the plotholes and obvious flaws cause directed by Nolan. Think they're doing him a favour but we have to call out such things, else we keep gonna get mediocre movies.

the opening scene was intense and thrilling.you don't actually get what's happening until later in the movie.
it reminded me of Memento you know because of time and stuff,but there nothing alike.
the cinematography was on point and the soundtraks they made me hyped in every scene,but in some parts of the movie were too loud that you couldn't hrear what there saying.but it wasn't big of a problem.

1929,Total_5_Destiny,"Great action and stunts, but overall dissapointing",6,29 August 2020,"Yesterday I saw Tenet, and after seeing it, I was fairly dissapointed. Nolan has build a reputation of making great movies, that revolve around a big scale of events, which Tenet delivers on. The action scenes and the special effects are amazing. I especially want to give a shoutout to the fight choreography, who invented the backwards fighting. This gave the movie a very unique feel.Unfortuantely the soundmixing was not all that great. The fight sequences were extremely loud, while the audio was a normal volume. From other reviews I heard a lot of people had issues with this mixing, where some theaters played everything really loud, while some had unhearable dialogue. This mixing made me dread going into the next action sequence, knowing how loud every part of it would be.The pacing of the movie also felt very rushed. Earlier on in development there were rumors that Tenet would be 3 hours long. It is possible that this was indeed the case and that the original 3 hour movie was paced a lot better. Unfortunately I can't judge that movie, only the one I have seen. Especially the first 30 minutes felt very rushed, where it felt we were hopping from country to country. Some more time to let us breath in the beginning, and to let us know our protaganist would have served the movie well.In the movie we never really get to see our characters. They constantly do stuff, but the actions that happen have sometimes more then a week of time in between them. It would have been nice to have them interact in some way, or emote over what was going on. I really missed a bonding between characters. The most we get of that is the last scene of the movie, which is like getting appatiser after dinner. I also found the female lead to be quite annoying. Her only motivation was constantly talking about her son. Even hearing people say that the world was gonna end she awnsered by saying; ""does that mean my son will die as well?""... This really isn't characterising her, but just using her son as a prop trying to convince us she is like us. Dont we all love our families?These issues really lowered the quality of the movie for me, but the technical aspects are still verry good. The acting was solid and the music was pretty good. There were some minor plot holes/goofs, which didn't affect me from enjoying the movie. The cinematogrophy was pleasant to watch. Overall I would give tenet a solid 6. It's a good action movie, but the issues mentioned above hinder it for me from being anything more then that.",Tenet

The two mains work together so well and are perfectly casted.I don't know how to explain it, but it just felt lacking compared to its heady cousin Inception. It made what could have been a cool and simple idea into something convoluted. The main mechanic of the film is truly something to behold, but Tenet gets caught up in trying to make sense of it all instead of just letting the idea run.The set pieces elevate what should have been a masterpiece of storytelling.

The fact that this movie actually lived up to what I expected, blew me away. Definitely a new one to add to the must watch list, along with the ones previously mentioned.
It is in fact thoroughly complex, with many philosophical questions throughout. As always, Nolan plays with time itself, and it may be hard to grasp if you are not familiar with his ways, or if you aren't 100% focused. I would recommend perhaps watching the movie with subtitles, and if you don't understand it at first, that you watch it a second time.
After you grasp the concept, you will be able to enjoy a real masterpiece, that will certainly remain in your mind the following days after watching it. Purely amazing, fulfilled all a fan could hope for.",Tenet

The entire plot was so utterly ridiculous and unbelievable. I love sci fi movies and really love time travel movies but this plot was a joke. They want you to believe if something (like a person or a bullet) is sent back in time they become inverted so they or it in the case of a bullet moves backwards compared to their surroundings. WTF ?? They want you to believe that once your transported back in time you continue to travel backwards in time and do not stop at your selected destination. The acting was OK but not award-winning by any means. Its not action packed either as I fell asleep 3 times trying to get through this movie. At the end they come up with another crazy plot for the end of the world which again is ridiculous. This is the first time travel movie I have disliked.,Tenet

After time went on I kept going back to the trailer for the mystery and music of course. By then I was hyped although like everyone else I knew nothing much about it. By the second trailer I was completely down. When I saw it in cinemas I had an ABSOLUTE BLAST!!!This film is probably the most complicated and multi layered film there is but that's a good thing! It's incredibly re-watchable, the action is fantastic, the acting is well done, the cinematography and use of sound mixing is extraordinary! I can go on for years, this is my favourite Christopher Nolan film and the more I think of it the better it becomes. It's extremely clever and just WOW! There was some scenes that I loved so much I couldn't help but just laugh, it was an absolute blast and one of the best if not the best experience I've EVER had at a cinema.This film is underrated in my opinion, yes it has a few minor little inconsistencies, I've watched it multiple times and by now I know about every little error there is. In about ten years I hope this becomes as game changing as inception did. I really enjoyed Tenet and would give a solid 9.5/10. Some little things that could have been changed/added for a 10/10 but apart from that I was very impressed.

The worst issue is that 90% of the film is characters talking the exposition of the film. If your plot is mostly dialogue, you are being told what to see, what to care about, who the characters and their motivations are. Don't tell, show, isn't that film 101? This is a tendency of Nolan's films and sometimes it works. You get a lot of dialogue as the characters walk on streets and chat in restaurants and then you get high adrenaline action scenes. Not a lot of building story or character development. It's his formula. But this is the worst execution of that. The science is murky and lazy, the characters are mostly boring and one dimensional and the movie drags on and on.Could have been good, there's potential in the premise, we all love s good sci Fi time travel movie.

The plot, albeit complex, is totally encompassing of Nolans directory throughout the years. Nolan's play and take on time and the impact that can have when altered and twisted continues with Tenet. Cinematography is of course mesmerically engrossing but the real highlight here is the plot. The plots bordering on theoretical physics and inversion parallels will leave many viewers perplexed.

I really want a sequel of Tenet now. 2020 was supposed to be a bad year but then TENET was released. It's really a must must watch.,Tenet

1950,nicolasanstee,A perfectly fine film.,5,26 August 2020,"A movie that tells you not to worry too much about the concept but continues to spend an hour explaining. A quarter of which is drowned out by sound effects and the sound track.A very unoriginal soundtrack i might add.Found my mind drifting at certain points in the film didn't quite grab me as expected.Found a lot of the characters bar John David Washington's and Robert Pattinson's to be paper thin.

Bad guy who is bad.Good performances all round.Some great action scene's.One instance of poor special effects.Worth a watch once, don't feel the need to revisit it.",Tenet
1951,thisaintsparta,Yes.,10,26 August 2020,"Well I'm a huge Nolan fan so I went into this with a lot of hype.Nolan delivered. In a different way than I wouldve thought. Which exceeded my expectations because I was pretty sure what I was getting.He turned down the emotional and personal aspects of the characters and turned up the dial to 101 on concept. Which I love!So you're getting such a dense and complex thriller you really have to watch it more than once, which I understand being a problem for some reviewers, but which I actually like.Movie of the year for me.Also, the acting of Robert Pattinson was so good, I cant wait to see what else that guy will do.This movie wholehandedly brought back my love for movies.(Watching it in german also dodged the more than problematic soundmixing, which is for me the real only flaw)",Tenet
1952,fablejoeygaming,A Truly Unbelievable Spectacle.,10,27 August 2020,"Tenet on spectacle alone is as close to perfection as you can get. I truly believe that this movie ups the bar for ""Action Cinema"" as it stands today. But... incredible visuals cannot carry a movie alone. As for the plot and the story, I think they are of such a high scale, and a complex manner, it can be quite hard to follow. Although I didn't understand every little detail the amount of respect I have for Nolan, is as always INSANELY HIGH. He respects the audience in the way that he doesn't give them the full perspective on the story till far into the film. For some viewers Tenet will be confusing, maybe even a little bloated in the exposition department. But for the rest of us, Tenet is genuinely a remarkable experience, and one I can't wait to revisit time, and time again.",Tenet

1955,sjui,Still Stunning,9,9 September 2020,"Fully immersed in it in the collision and interweaving of the forward and reverse time trajectories. Christopher is undoubtedly a maverick who insisted on telling stories and conquering the audience in his own way. The scenario is brainy and thrilling, so goes the soundtrack- but a little bit monotonous. Obviously You can see something inherited from Christopher's former works such as Memento and Interstellar.
It's truly a tough work for Chris and his team to conceive such a complicated concept and present it onscreen. What they did is far beyond just finishing it, and to some extent, bringing it to a marvelous standard.
But it's a petty that some of the concepts are actually paradoxes. As for the pacing, it's a little bit too quick and tensive, even relative to its theme of a spy game. It looks like that Chris has focused a little bit too much on the complexity and fitness to cinemas, and, as a result, lose something of his own. Given those above Tenet is actually secondary to Inception and Interstellar, where he made truly successful balance between Nolan films and traditional Hollywood films.
This may not be the best movie of Chris, but still a remarkable blockbuster. Just as the protagonist has it, don't trynna understand it, just get yourself absorbed in the thrilling time trajectories. You will definitely find it worthwhile.",Tenet

Nolan is truly a visionary in film but like some genres of music, Nolan films just aren't for me in the theater.I couldn't spoil the movie if I tried because I really cannot tell you what happened. The plot was out of reach for me and I couldn't keep track of who/when/what was going. I will pay to see it again (not in a theater) It will take multiple viewings to dissect.

Tenet.....well, not as much!! The ""time inversion"" contrivance just didn't really hold me and to make a movie confusing just to make it look ""thoughtful"" is also sorta lacking!! Fine actors, performances, (Kenneth B delivers a scary stone faced Russian oligarch!!) some fun effects...but when a movie becomes a chore to watch, it's just not fun...looking forward to his next film!!",Tenet
1960,Finnick-at-Nuernberg,Absolutely ingenious! Be sure to watch it several times!,10,1 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan delivers another punch!
A film that again takes up the topic of time anomaly, but this time much more complex and difficult to understand than
back in ""Interstellar"".
Although the film has a long running time (2.5 hours), there is so much going on in parallel, interlaced and quickly told that you definitely have to watch the film several times to understand it entirety.
First the obvious in advance:
The cast is superbly selected. The actors are not yet seen dead and offer a more than convincing performance.
The locations are spectacular, exciting and definitely unique. Like in a James Bond movie, only better.
The soundtrack is written by Ludwig Göransson and is simply epic about the film.
No CGI effects visible, elaborate film scenes, perfectly realized.To the topic:
Simply put, it's about what happens when objects can move backwards through time.
It is not easy to explain but the fact is that anomalies or paradoxes occur.
So if you take a person A, then this person A can cross a so called turnstile in the movie, which reverses the time for him. From the point of view of an observer B, who has not entered the turnstile, this person seems to disappear into nothingness.
Here the anomaly arises: At an earlier point in time there are two people A. One moves forward through the time A+ (up to the turnstile) and the other A- moves backward (from the turnstile), respectively inversely. From the point of view of A+ his second ego A- seems to move backwards. But in this case this is only a question of perspective. Because from the view of A- the whole world, including A+ now moves backwards.This raises several interesting questions which the film takes up:
1. what happens if A+ and A- meet by chance?
2. isn't it then already predetermined that A+ will enter the turnstile, no matter what he decides?
At this point quote from Neil: ""A creed of faith in mechanics"" (principle of causality)
Is the decision only a subjective illusion? Neil: ""That does not excuse doing nothing""
3. can A- kill his former self A+ or change his past?
Hard to imagine, because how else could the older A- exist. ""Grandfather paradox""The film doesn't go into the technology of these turnstiles, which I don't think is important in view of this interesting topic.
Christopher Nolan uses these questions as the hook of his film. Through the fast narrative style and the filming from different time perspectives he makes this an extremely demanding film with extreme depth!",Tenet
1961,LiquorList,Completely Unwatchable Tripe,1,31 December 2020,"People giving this more than three stars really need to watch a few more decent movies. This thing was so bad, it was unbelievable.

1962,magnetron-51383,Very Bad,1,3 September 2020,It was the worst film I have seen in ages. Bad muddled story line and the actors were mundane.

1963,csbarry,Not Nolan's Best.,3,8 May 2021,"Reading a few of the reviews I'm glad to see I'm not alone. This is watchable but just barely and to some I can see it being just too much.I won't contain spoilers but there seemed to be a few gaps or inconsistencies in the plot so I'm either not smart enough or Nolan made no efforts to explain anything deliberately because in actuality some of it just made no sense, I've enjoyed his previous complexity but this falls short.Only really from a visual perspective does it have any impact but that wears off pretty quickly. And set are bland, featureless and boxy.Characters are completely empty with little connection, the score is FAR too loud completely ruining scenes. I understand ramping it up to add to the chaos but it was too much and at points in no way matched the scene. Confusing the audience alone isn't justification of a good film, if I wanted viewing to not make sense, I'd watch count down.Pattinson is good to be fair but that's about it. The whole thing in style was a bit to reminiscent of parts of inception and even Batman with the voice and big rigs but lacked and of the fun.I've tried to not sound pretentious here which is something the film really struggles.",Tenet

Who was in the future? Who was in the past?The actors and director understood the movie it seems as it was explained to them by the writers over and over again, but you donkeys you are not making the movie so you can watch it!

1965,karaoglan-20649,"Best movie ever, and I'll explain why. And I will also explain why some people didnt like it and I'll answer some bad reviews.",8,16 October 2020,"Okay lets start with why some people didnt like this movie. They couldnt understand it and they blamed the movie. Look, let me tell you something, casual watchers think themselves smart, and when they cant understand something, its never their fault - its always the movie's fault. For example they understood the interstellar , thought they were smart and thought that they were one of those ""rare"" people who understood the movie. However this is far from truth. Anyone who watches it carefully can understand it. But thats not the way casual viewer thinks. Like I said everybody views themselves as smart and when they cant understand it, movie is just bad to them.Now to the ""why is this movie so great""First of all music is great I am listening to the main theme while writing this.Plot is so detalied and so perfectly put up its hard to believe how nolan did this. If you wanna know what I'm talking about just google tenet plot explained.Characters are great and acting is great. Sators actor is just great. Especially bromance of neil and protagonist hooked me up to the movie and I really wanted to see these two succeed.Action scenes are immense and HARDEST TO SHOOT out there. We have seen millions of action scenes. None of them are this hard to shoot let me tell you.Inversion is a very cool concept and is perfectly added to the plot. I definitly want to see more of it. I hope there will be a tenet 2.The ending is good but bitter. Really makes you think.Now some answers to the critics;1) Characters are soulless they dont have characters and there is no plot development.Wrong. The protagonist has a golden heart and you can understand this if you watch closely. In the opera scene he doesnt have to save civilians, he does it anyway. In oslo when they are planning the plane attack he says "" there must be no civilians "" , and thats one of the reasons he cares about Kat. In the end when neil is walking to his own death he tries to save him by saying "" cant be change things if we do it differently"" plus he makes some jokes here and there.Sator is a narcicist maniac and arms dealer. The way he chooses to end the world with himself is pretty reasonable (for himself). Some people say its not realistic, well than you have never seen a megolomaniac in your life.Kat is not just a mother who tries save his sons life. She is also a woman who is trying to break free from the strings of a man and represents a lot of the woman in our present time who are oppressed by their egoist brute force user husbands / partners.Neil is my favoruite character. He is a charming funny man but more importantly he knows more than anyone because he was sent there. Moreover he is not afraid to make sacrifices for his mission, even his life. As we see at the end of the movie :(2) Why does Protagonist save Kat? There is no reason.Yes there is, to use Kat against Sator. And succeeds by the way.3) Why do people in the future are trying to destroy us? Its not explanied.I dont know how can anyone claim its not explained but it is explained. We understand this by the dialogue between sator and the main character. The reason is because of the global warming earth has become a hell. Only way for them to survive is killing their ancestors so that they (we) cant destroy the nature no more and their present will be fixed.4) The other claim I see a lot that movie is boring, trash, confusing etc. Well it is meant to be confusing and I dont really know what to say to people who say its boring. Well its your opinion. I wasnt bored. May be you have :( I wish you could enjoy it as well :(Tenet is overall an amazing movie. The people who did not understand it are casual viewers who want every plot detail in front of them with a golden plate. When that doesnt happen oh well, the movie is just bad.Tenet by ""acting, plot, pacing, music, grand final, twists, action scenes, dialogues, overall detail "" has won my heart and it is my favoruite movie right now. I am waiting for a Tenet 2.",Tenet

It is a visually impressive feat to behold, but there is not a single ""character"" in this film, just chess pieces.
Honestly, I would say the film could approach perfection if it had an additional hour add onto the beginning to give the characters actual personalities and give the audience time to process what they're being told. As is, it's so much so fast that it's completely disorienting.
The second half is the real meat of the film and it becomes more like watching a master playing 3D chess where it's just stunning to see, though it is a touch predictable if you manage to catch on to any concepts presented in the first half. The story and characters are stupidly basic as to not get in the way of the super complex machinery of the concepts. The villain is a cartoon character and only three people get names, none of which I could tell you until over half way through the film. Go in understanding that people don't matter in this movie.

Tenet is a complex intertwining enigma with a mixture of monochrome acting, with a multitude of incomprehensible sentences and phrases that should explain the universe in which the main protagonists found themselves.Expectation, reasoning, excitement, and catharsis are adrift in this collage of time dilation. The modern viewer will be unmoored in a sea of attempts by the young cast to explain time travel zones and their passage through them. Of course, the famous director is again trying to intimidate us and throw us into admiring the ingenious idea that exudes the whole movie.
This time, it seems to have lacked a bit of aroma, simplicity, and essence that creates magic on the movie screen. To quote the legendary poet: ""I wanted a lot, I started a lot, but the hour of brisk, has swept me away.""The very idea that the whole world dies out with one man is very immature and indigestible. The average viewer, and even the slightly more intelligent one, will not forgive such diegesis from a legendary director who celebrated hit after hit in his magnificent career.Today's cinema cannot boast itself with originality and artistic impression. We are living in a world of abundance where everything is in our grasp and has its price. Cinematography is no exception to this.

1983,chmollo,"Christopher Nolan's first ""art' movie?",7,30 June 2021,"Weird visuals, apparently incomprehensible plot that may only make sense on repeated viewings. Is this a David Lynch film? No, but it did make me think of the experience of watching a David Lynch film, rather than a James Bond film. When I watch a David Lynch film, in order to appreciate it I need to temporarily disengage my analytical mind and just let the imagery enter my sub-conscious. The movie ends, I need to sit for a while to let it sink in, then I can figure out what it was I was watching (if I want to). Tenet seems to force a similar set-up for me, but the visual imagery is less internal/intriguing/ambiguous, more external/gimmicky/explicit. Do I assess its value based on that mode of viewing? When Tenet finishes, there was such an overload of imagery that the images don't seem to have sunk in, so it's hard for them to swim together back to the surface of my consciousness to make a cohesive whole. And it doesn't really compel me to make sense of it because, as others have pointed out, we've made only a small investment in the characters to have enough emotional investment to care enough about it.

If however, after another watch, I dont get it, then I will be a little annoyed to have to google what the hell is going on.My advice, If you want to understannd this film at all, whatever you do, don't watch it while doing anything else e.g looking at social media, doing your online grocery shop, talking to anybody, eating, looking anywhere other than the screen, blinking, breathing etc.",Tenet
1993,dikeroc,Easily the worst Nolan film,3,26 August 2020,"Being a huge Nolan fan I anticipated this release. I think everyone of his films (exluding the mediocre third batman) is a masterpiece. Unfortunately this time he got everything wrong. First of all the script, though based on an interesting idea, is all over the place. Nothing is explained or completed. I struggled for the first hour to understand what is happening and then I stopped caring. And that brings us to the second fault. There are no characters, only puppets with no backstory or evolvment arc, muttering Nolan's ideas like ""text to voice"" wikipedia. The music is very annoying, most of the time covering the actors voices. The actors try to do their best with what the were given which is not much. Well...with the exception of the completely talentless protagonist. Hope this mess is the only low point in Nolan's filmography.",Tenet

1999,bohumil-cambalik,This is what madness looks like,1,18 September 2020,"Aside from what had already been said here, this movie just confirms that time travel concept as Hollywood views it is stupid.The real time travel is an idea of you getting into a rocket and travelling through space at high speed and then returning back to Earth, so you only age very little, while all those left on Earth are now old or dead. Time just flows differently for you.The way Hollywood sees it is going back into the past and interacting with it. Changing what already isn't. So how is this going to happen? You create a machine that will - for your own whim - create a biological copy of yourself that can interact with your past self and change the substance of things to way they were before? And does this only apply to our planet or will the death of one Russian oligarch delete everything and sets every other intelligent race in the universe back to Big Bang?Do you see how insane this is?",Tenet

2007,glennpettit1,Complicated but ultimately not so confusing,8,8 April 2021,"Mild spoiler in case you haven't seen any of the trailers: This film is about a version of time travel. Now if, like me, you've seen the old Planet of the Apes movies, any time travel episode/movie from Star Trek, or even 12 Monkeys (movie or TV show), you know time travel can be complicated. Well, Christopher Nolan has made it even MORE complicated.Because of that, you actually have to WATCH this whole film carefully. You can't be idly looking at your phone and hoping the action piece or dialog will tell you what's up. Nope, that ain't gonna happen! You need to watch for the clues throughout the film, and then when you get to the end, you'll get it. It will almost all come together.Having said that, Nolan really challenged himself to portray the kind of time travel he decided to give us, and the results are spectacular. Yes, there SEEM to be plot holes, and there are some dangling threads at the end that you're just itching to pull to see where they lead. But overall, the film hits its marks. I'd still be curious to know more about what happens after the end of the film, and how it truly connects to the beginning, but...well, NOLAN.My one gripe with time travel end-of-the-universe-as-we-know-it stories in general is the anthropocentric nature of it all -- i.e. Some human figures out how to manipulate time on a local level, and somehow that ends up able to affect the whole universe. Oh spare me! Might as well have Superman fly around the earth and spin it backwards to reverse time and save Lois Lane. Yeah, they actually did that in one film that was otherwise pretty good up to that point.Nonetheless, Tenet is a good film, and if you've seen movies like Source Code or the TV show Seven Days, then you'll kind of understand what's going on. Even then, you might need another time through to get it all. Fortunately for us, we can rewind to watch what we missed. ;-)",Tenet
2008,ajwatkins-695-92473,Does Your Head Hurt Yet?,1,15 June 2021,"I think Robert Pattinson summed this movie up perfectly in one sentence............""Does your head hurt yet?""Tenet is a little flash, a LOT of BANG, and very little else....... I have NEVER been so ANNOYINGLY confused watching any movie EVER, and that's where the usually hyper-intuitive Nolan FAILS INEXCUSABLY. He loses the audience in the noise, quite literally and figuratively, becoming so tangled up in his own too far reaching ambition, that we are left stranded, disoriented, ears ringing, stumbling through a pretentious mess of fractured time, moving both forward and backward, unsure which way is even up!!! Tenet tragically confuses intelligent with paradoxically convoluted, trying WAY too hard to be everything that it is not. The main character is simply called, ""The Protagonist."" Really? Are you freaking KIDDING me!? Ironically, while resolved to an irksome fault to be drastically different, Tenet puts absolutely NO creativity into its cardboard cut, stock characters. (Save for Robert Pattinson, who was the only actor in this big budget spoof that had a PULSE!!!!) The stereotypical self-aggrandized Russian who wants to take the world out too, if he dies, the put-upon wife who married for money, hungry for revenge, and the so tellingly named Protagonist, who is all but a blank slate, with ZERO distinctive personality. I didn't care about any of their fates, save for Rob with his Chuck Bass coif, and SMASHING suits, and by the end, I was so completely LOST, I just wanted it all over and done with, inverted time nonsense be DAMNED!!!!The hyped-up special effects which seem cool at first, become tedious by the end. Oh everything's playing in reverse. Again. Great, now where in the HELL in the timeline are we!? Ughhhh.Consider this your inverted time message from the future, or whatever, and SKIP THIS MOVIE!!!! YES, Rob, my head DOES hurt, EVERYONE'S head HURTS, why are you running backwards!? Why is *spoiler* Trophy-Wife-Who's-Name-I-Already-Forgot trying to kill the ONE man that can take the world out with him, if he dies?

If you're into completely understanding the film, then you need to watch this multiple times. The main concept of their time travel idea is somehow too complicated for people who just want to enjoy a film.Analyzing the concept of the time travel this movie keeps explaining thoughout the film is not a good use of most people's time. Christopher Nolan needs to understand that most people just want to enjoy the film as it is. We're not here to understand complicated concepts - if we do, we'll just enroll to a physics class.Subtitle is needed to watch his film because for some reason, Christopher Nolan thought music is much more important to hear than the dialogues.",Tenet

2012,spoc824,Quite possibly the most confused I've ever been,4,5 May 2021,"I can't think of a time in my life where I have been more confused than when watching this movie. Difficult movie to watch and understand. It took me about double the run time to watch because I have to keep rewinding. I always fee like I'm missing something. Usually plots dont go over my head but hey maybe something just isn't sticking here.To start, I have so many questions about the characters. Who is the main character? Who does he work for? Who are these mercenaries and team members who join the missions with little planning? Michale Caine? The beginning scenes are cut together with only primary details but has me asking more questions because of it. I'm not even going to get into the time travel/inverted aspect of the film. Things somewhat get put together but I'm still left questioning a lot. My brain is in a pretzel.Visually, the movie is incredible. The effects and sets are all awesome. Acting is very good too even with subpar dialogue. Great cast all around. If watching this movie multiple times is what it takes to understand, that to me is a failure in story telling. Regardless of director and budget. This is a 2.5 hour commitment, not a quick watch, we should know what happens during that runtime. If I'm telling my friends a story and have to tell them again so they get it, they'll roast me.",Tenet
2013,rida_rock,Confusing at first watch,8,10 December 2020,"Well Well Well, This movie is by far more complex than Inception, It's going to take multiple viewings to truly appreciate the concept of the story. I recommend at least 2 or 3 mandatory viewings, Because there are so many things hidden throughout the 2 hours and half. You need to pay attention and listen closely to the dialogue.
The action in the movie was really enjoyable and you can easily notice Nolan's touch in it, Especially in the first scene with that brilliant sequence shot from the cinematographer.However there are some things I didn't like about this movie. There was so much depth in the story that took an extremely space and even took over some of the main characters development, But generally the movie was great, It's definitely not Nolan's best work but I enjoyed it, I really did.",Tenet

But this is just an artifice to hide the fact that we are missing the really exciting bit - when someone comes into contact with their antii-self and must instantly annihilate - I was waiting for this but it never happened.Exciting in parts and confusing. Not very good sound and jumps between scenes were too abrupt - hopping from Estonia to Mumbai and back again without much effort.There might be a prequel/sequel which will also be called Tenet, where they might do a bit more multiverse hopping just to mix it up a bit.",Tenet

Its just not for everyone. Tenet and last movie before Dunkirk maybe not be on same level like Nolan old classics but when i left theater after those two movies i said to myself something suprising. I never seen anything like this, i never seen movie like this ever before. Whats the point of filmaking? Making cliche movies or making something different?

2020,gyorffi_kristof,"Built to entertain, not to explain time travel",8,13 September 2020,"Tenet is not a usual movie that shows really well what Nolan has going for it.The music the action sequence the complicated but a masterfully delicate plotline is definetly something that gives an amazing cinematic experience if you can let go of either not understanding or seeing how something doesn't fit. Because I don't think there is anyone who can understand the whole of it on the go to understand every detail it requires more watches. Exposition which Inception was known for, is dialed back to not try to prove this scientifically implausible idea but make you get it. It explains the bare minimum to be able understand the plotline but it doesn't try to give you a strong explanation on the physics for a reason. It is implausible and the movie sends the director's message throughout the whole time to not dwell on it, get the plotline and enjoy the action.On the other hand it still ends up diving into the questions of fatelism, purpose and real heroes which gives it a decent deepness as much as it is possible for such a idea but can still fulfill some of our big question thinking.It's unique it's well-executed, it's not perfection but it is as much as the idea can be. I'm more of a ""plotguy"" and don't prefer action but it was highly enjoyable after just letting go of the plausibility. It's unique it's fun it's cinema, definetly worth a watch.",Tenet

I think the concept would have been better realised with a more Blade Runner/Altered Carbon/Sci-Fi time frame or a more a drastically more artistic and flamboyant visual.

He's a 'time travelling temporal agent' who keeps trying to get the one that got away. I have a strong suspicion Nolan saw this movie more than once, one of Hawke's best, the breakout performance of Sarah Snook (Succession) who is a marvel here. If you liked Tenet, you'll love this precursor in theme. It takes more than one watch to fully get it, like Tenet, but if these themes of time could be manipulated each film has much to offer on the subject. Also Heinline's short story that Hawke's movie was based, this famous sci-fi writer must also have been read by Nolan.",Tenet

2036,timothybidmead,Please watch it again - with subtitles (no spoilers),10,9 January 2021,"So I didn't see this when released at the cinema as I live in New York and, well, cinemas remain closed.Based on the comments after cinema release, I did watch with subtitles on a 65"" 4K with surround sound, which I guess is the best I'm going to get. I did have subtitles on but I think the sound mixing was fine for home viewing (not sure if they adjusted it), didn't need the subs.The concept of the movie really is much more simple than it comes across - a simple time travel paradox with a neat concept about duty, sacrifice, and destiny. Don't overthink it, if you've seen it once and don't quite get it, just watch it again.I really, really paid attention based on what I'd read so that's the only reason I think I got it first viewing. If you're reading this and haven't seen it, just pay attention to everything - it's such a cool pay off. There are lingering questions but that's simply because of the nature and paradox of time travel loops.I'll be watching again to spot all the things I missed. People are hating on Nolan for the fact that you need to watch it more than once - I think this is the wrong viewpoint. This movie is understandable at first viewing, it's not a mindless bundle of tripe spelled out for you, but I'm excited to rewatch it and see new things. Nolan has done this before with Inception, Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige.RPatz and JDW are superb, as is Debicki.Please please keep making movies like this - raising the bar for people that don't need everything spelled out like Mission Impossible.",Tenet

2040,PizzaBizza,Optics,5,14 September 2020,"I get it: Drugs are a great way to come up with a neat plot for a movie. But please revise your script when you are sober again.Minor sppoilers ahead!The film is full of contradictions and I didn't get much out of it. The first half tries to be some kind of espionage story, with random people going to random places to get random hints that do not contribute much to the story. It does not invite you to think along, since all conclusions are pretty much random. Shortly after the time-themed parts begin to unfold nothing makes sense anymore, but at least it all looks great. I honestly had no idea what the film is about, why exactly people are fighting and what they were trying to achieve. In Interstellar, although I might not grasp the physics behind everything, I still understood what was at stake and why the protagonists were acting as they were, but here it's all very random and nothing makes sense: Apparently you can affect a piece of time-inverted item into doing stuff that you will cause in the future, but it doesn't work later on, or it does not matter anymore. In the one second ""heat causes stuff to freeze"" (just for the cool effect that is), in the next minute it doesn't and it's all back to good, solid shooting and explosions. The idea of forward-time and backward-time were just not convincingly adopted and although I had the feeling, that there would be cool possibilities, none oft the ideas were not really exploited to an understandable or interesting level. I did not like the box-in-a-box-in-a-box theme in Inception, and in this case it is just a cover upCharacters and their relationships were totally random too, and I can't see why anybody thinks this was great acting. It is not. The actors often seemed to struggle to understand their relationships too. Their motives did not matter, nothing really mattered.The whole thing feels like being written stoned and there was no effort to fix the giant plot holes, instead it gets plastered with lots of action in the end. All in all an exhausting, long and pointless movie. It often feels as if nobody in Nolans team told him about the obvious mistakes the film makes.",Tenet

In fact, it was so poor I started to feel relieved when the music subsided because it meant I didn't have to strain to hear what people were saying. After it was done, a stranger randomly asked me if something was wrong with the theater's speakers. However, after a quick google it appears that a lot of people are having issues with this.Secondly, this film does not make any sense. This isn't a spoiler as it is shown in the trailer, but doing stuff like catching a bullet breaks causality. No matter how you justify it, this is so non-intuitive and far-fetched from reality it harms the film. This is a far cry from Nolan's other similar films like Inception and Interstellar.However, I still gave it a higher score because there were some really interesting, unique, and thought provoking concepts that I go to Nolan's films for. It will certainly benefit from re-watches (preferably with subtitles) to appreciate the film in its entirety.",Tenet
2044,dctatjer,Overrated,5,8 September 2020,"Nolan is trying to be as confusing as possible because this has given good results in the past.

2045,ckmccabe,2020 Just Keeps Getting Worse,1,7 September 2020,"I like Christopher Nolan movies, mostly. Often times the dialogue can be a bit hammy and the movie doesn't hold up As well following the first movie theater watch, but that's ok. To me, they're a better casual flick than some MCU trash or Fast Cars 18.This movie though? It's just the culmination of what's already the worst year in memory.Dialogue? What I heard of it was TRASH. The audio in this movie is TERRRRRIBLE and I probably only heart 20/30% of it. What I did hear was usually cringe inducing and pretentious, causing me to burst into momentary giggle fits. ""YOU BREAK ZE HEART OF ZE TIGER!!!""The action? Unfortunately, the movie blows it's impressive action chops early on with a fantastic sequence at an airport. This sequence reminded me of inception with its impressively mind bending editing and dependence on practicality. After this though, prepare to be assaulted with barrages of war shattering explosions and meh-tier visuals. The last half hour of this movie is laughably predictable and horrible.I really have allot more to say but I cannot bear the idea of spending anymore time of my life thinking about this movie.

2052,dereksorensen,?detacilpmoc oot si detacilpmoc woH,9,4 September 2020,"First off, let me just say that no one should really be reviewing this movie after one viewing (which I am admittedly doing). I can guarantee the majority of opinions will drastically change after a second viewing. Much of this film is easily misunderstood and will require multiple viewings. This is Nolan's most complicated film to date. Though it is complex, there is a sense the film is not meant to be understood completely immediately. ""Don't try to understand it-feel it"", says one of the film's characters.The film feels high-paced from start to finish. Even scenes of calmer dialogue have quicker cuts and edits, giving a greater feeling to the dialogue vertigo this film already easily induces. To make things even more complicated, Nolan has overplayed much of the dialogue with score and sound mixing. Whether this is a grave mistake or a deliberate decision is yet to be understood. Point is, this film is hard to follow.I am confident Nolan is aware of the deep confusion his viewers will have. However, I am not sure if he is aware of the emotional distancing this creates between the characters and the viewers. Because the audience is playing ""catch-up"" to the plot for such an extended period of film time, it is hard to really invest into the characters. It takes an hour plus to finally see personal morals and feelings in the characters, thus letting the viewers invest more in the survival and well-being of the characters. Other than the plot being so complicated it is emotionally distancing, I have no honest complaint about this film.One of the most impressive feats of the film is its commitment to real photography and large outdoor sets. It is pure eye-candy. Nolan continues to baffle the ongoing film trends that suggest green-screening and CGI are adequate replacement for actual photography. It is films like this that make viewers agree more with the sentiment of Martin Scorsese, ""Marvel is not cinema"". I think a producer's worst nightmare is having to be in a Christopher Nolan story board meeting. If Nolan can imagine it, he can find a way to shoot it.The acting in the film pairs well with the writing. John David Washington does perfect as a sci-fi version of a quick-witted James Bond. Kenneth Branagh demonizes the villain brilliantly with his excellent balance of subtlety and bursts of aggression. Between these two underrated actors, the film's complicated plot is much more endurable.Though Hans Zimmer was not part of this movie, Ludwig Göransson substitutes in perfectly. The movie sounds and feels like a true Nolan project. From a viewer's standpoint, it even sounds like some of the sounds within the score are being played in reverse.Needless to say, this film falls in line with the rest of Nolan's films in regards to quality. Is it his best film? Probably not. But then again, only after audiences have viewed this film multiple times will there be a true decision on its legacy.",Tenet
2053,michaeljameshill-98919,Unwatchable Garbage,4,28 October 2021,"Nolan went out of his way here to be the ""I'm smarter than the audience"" director and the movie suffered greatly as a result. The rules of the movie's main gimmick don't make any sense and aren't applied consistently, the characters are forgettable, flat, and undeveloped, the score is way too loud and key dialogue can't be heard as a result. In the end there's really nothing to like about this film. The plot is next to impossible to follow by design, there is nothing to like about the characters, and the movie's main gimmick gets old fast. All I can say is that this movie was so terrible it felt like it was 4 hours long and at the end of it my wife and myself were like, ""What the eff did we just watch?"". Complete trash.",Tenet

It pushes so many boundaries - the plot, the cinematography, the stunts, the action.Whether you like Nolan movies, Tenet is a must watch, since it's something you have never seen before. Almost inaccessible at first, the film assembles itself like a puzzle in front of your eyes during successive viewings.Chris Nolan has always challenged himself in the making of his films and with Tenet he also challenges his audience. The first time I saw the movie I was extremely confused, though very impressed. The second time I could follow the plot, see new details and understand subtle cues hinting at what's to come. In a way you start seeing thing like a time-traveller.Tenet is a marvel. Storytelling-wise and technically.

The movie will be confusing, dry with no humor in the first half. But if you manage to observe most of the details then you are in for a real treat as the latter half is mind blowing.

And nuclear weapons, weehee... I was really disappointed at this after seen the epic Interstellar and Batman movies. The reverse time thing has potential but this movie is just poorly executed with many flaws. And the screencast does not impress me either. I have no interest in watching this the second time in order to understand it. The movie really is that bad. B class movie, nothing special. I was hoping a lot more from the most hyped movie of 2020.

2064,dvxasdon,I can't believe Nolan did this film,7,4 December 2020,"The very glaring problems like no emotional depth or poor sound design are already mentioned in many reviews.
Editing were poor at some places and excellent at others. There is a scene where it feels body language wise that Protagonist is about to talk but it is cut immediately to something else. Naming the protagonist protagonist is downright lazy. Main actor Protagonist I didn't feel the acting convincing. Also the music is used even at places unnecessary. Music feels a bit monotonous as I felt no elevations or depressions. The Sci fi elements aren't fascinating. Dreams and time travel etc are fascinating. But this is something totally alien. Story feels artificial on many levels which I can't pin point exactly. Why does the Protagonist trust Neil from the beginning is also perplexing. The suspense in the movies were lot more predictable than Nolan's other movies. The fight with the masked man was predictable as the reason he weears mask is because audience knows the identity of the character. Neil was either an enemy or friend from future was also predictable. I would never watch this film again because films should never be watched again except in our own minds. Choosing of locations felt like James Bond movies , glamour for glamours sake.",Tenet

And just when the plot was taking shape-it was predictable in the most mediocre way possible.
I was not disappointed with the movie as a whole but with the plot; too simple of a story, tangled with confusion and wrapped too quickly to make sense. In terms of the concept of the movie it was new -one tenth of it at least, the rest was part here and part there - boiling it down to an old gift in a new present paper.
The wonderful parts of the movie were the fresh faces that you do not get to see otherwise in the Nolan made movies. However, it is always a delight to see Sir Michael Caine, and although it was more of a cameo role, it was graceful as always. There was humour that was not expect - bold and with a punch.",Tenet

In scenes people and cars would be going one way and others would be going the other way in reverse.And the 'mumbling' from the actors/actresses didn't help. Half the time I couldn't make out what they were saying.After one hour I noticed people starting to leave as they gave up on trying to follow the film. Basically, it got boring as you gave up trying to understand it.The main male actor was quite good except I think the camera work could have been better in not somehow showing him to be about 4 feet something 'tall'. It didn't help that the main female lead towered over him in scenes.

Had discounted critics who said the plot complexity interfered with the cinematic experience, as the same has been said before of other Nolan films, notably Inception, which I thoroughly enjoyed the first time even if it took multiple viewings to fully appreciate all of the nooks and crannies. There is something to be said for just going along for the ride and enjoying the scenery even if you miss some of it along the way. I couldn't enjoy this ride as the FOMO was too powerful, even at an unconscious level, for me to simply sit back and appreciate the obviously first-rate technical & directorial aspects and overall decent casting. To continue the road trip analogy, watching this movie was akin to traveling to the Grand Canyon or the Louvre wearing a mask with a couple of pinholes poked out, before being ushered out after two and a half hours. I was left with a great sense of disappointment which will probably deter me from slipping the disc back in for the requisite repeat viewing anytime soon. Such a shame.",Tenet

I do not believe that is a valid motive .From cinema point of view , the idea is not bad , but the execution went too far , the movie became very complex at some point that i doubt the creators even understood what was going on . The choice of actors was bad , all of them did not seem to fit , they were not attractive . Hard to fall in love with the character .Seems there was a problem in the sound as well .

Nolan if you read this review please add more emotion to your characters, let us feel their pain more and let us find joy when they find joy.I really enjoyed this story and film and i can't wait to watch it again and again, but be warned that if everything can be undone or changed in the undoing, of which is possible, then this review was never written, the film was never made and world war 3 has to happen",Tenet

I know Nolan has denied his hand was forced on this in interviews, but it is just so obvious, given how perfect the casting of all the other characters is in this film is and how perfect the casting was in all his other films.

That has been his strength as a master story teller thus far. Unfortunately the usual build, and execution was not present in this film. Here are the issues:1. Intriguing opening scene, that falls apart with excessive cuts to new locations/characters without any real explanation2. Too many scenes were done for the visual aesthetic, even though they ended up convoluting the plot (blue boat scene, early tower scene, and others)3. Poor sense of who the characters were, and the specific motivations they were supposed to have. Yes the characters say ""I care about X"" but it is not believable, it's just a phrase that is thrown around to cover the bare essentials of character development. Attraction between characters seems to come out of nowhere and be unfounded4. Poor acting by the lead. He seemed very wooden over all and not serious in the role.5. Terrible sound quality. There are MANY characters with heavy accents that are not picked up clearly and honestly just sound like they are speaking nonsense. This is mainly due to the accents, the speed that the person is speaking, the excessive background noise that makes hearing anything hard, and the topics generally being so crazy that you don't have time to process what is being said because you are straining to hear anything in the first place.6. Confusing for confusion's sake. Early in the movie there are an extreme number of random ""hoops"" and contacts that need to be jumped through, and ultimately are COMPLETELY unnecessary. More time should have been spent explaining the core concept better, rather than creating a slew of pointless characters and contacts that have no real importance other than being a vehicle for visuals (windmills, tower scene, etc).There are also many strengths to this film:1: The core concept is FASCINATING and a clearer picture of it would have made this a rival for potentially unseating Inception as Nolan's ""most mind blowing"" Film2. Robert Pattinson was very good, and easily the best actor in this film and ended up doing a lot of the heavy lifting character development wise3. The action scenes are mesmerizing to watch. Definitely confusing as you try to process what is going on, but also what you see is beautiful chaos4. Cinematography and visuals as always were spectacular, and this film is very pleasant to look at 95% of the time",Tenet
2101,DonnahL,My ears are ringing 24hrs later...No Oscars for Sound Effects,4,21 September 2020,"Firstly, take earmuffs or something. My mother sat through most of the movie with fingers in her ears, my ears have still been ringing 24hrs later! This was particularly bad at the start of the film - I was ready to walk out after 15mins of ear-deafening soundtrack, with no point to it other than to make a lot of noise: case in point the early railway scene. Seriously do we need the sound of 10 freight trains to over-shadow the action going on?! I couldn't even concentrate on the screen it was so deafening.Secondly, once you get past the horrendous sound effects at the beginning, the story seems like it is going to be ok, you can sort of follow it, and thankfully most of it takes place in the real world....this takes you up to about an hour.
Then the switch happens and you are forced to sit through the story you just watched in reverse and all jumbled up BORING!! It wasn't that great of a story in the first place, let alone to have to see it twice!
After 2 hours I was tired and exhausted and just wished I was watching this at home so I could turn it off and sleep - come back to the ending later- it wasn't like I was compelled to find out what happened....Last 30mins - as painful, loud, confusing, pointless as expected. No payoff, no explanation for how it's even possible that if one man kills himself then the world will end because of an ""algorithm"" that is already split up and hidden and nowhere near him in anyway and from what I could tell, not connected to any power source???!!! Maybe this is one for Wikipedia to answer! But really should we have to resort to that? A movie should be self-contained.
The worst part of the film is the ending. Especially when it was revealed that the ""protagonist"" would have to do this all over again on repeat in the future! Poor soul I feel for you...
What a boring life you will have.If you think I don't like ""repeat movies""
That's not the case as I really liked Edge of Tomorrow.
I've given this movie 4 stars for Elizabeth Debeki because at least Nolan had the foresight to put a beautiful woman on screen to add some soothing colour and help ease the pain.My mother (who loves Inception) has said this movie has done it for her now. She won't go back to the movies if her ears will be blown off. She'd rather watch Netflix now where she can control the sound and put on subtitles, if needed, for the dialogue. I don't disagree with her.The only reason we sat through this and didn't ask for our money back is because there are literally no alternative movies being released at the moment. I think any box office for this will be utterly false and due to Covid-19. I think Nolan knew this would be a flop if released with actual screen competition.",Tenet

2104,staceyj67,Disappointing,3,9 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan' films are usually a cerebral treat. This man has a great imagination but he lets himself down big time with this one. I found myself irritated at how unnecessarily wordy the dialogue was. Every single character reems off line after line in a very mechanical fashion and you know they have no clue what they are saying! Lines are read and facial expressions change infrequently. Kenneth Branagh lectures far too much and the conversation between him and his wife at gunpoint is unrealistic, his phone conversation at the supposed end of the world far too preachy, and his accent is terrible. Michael Caine is thrown in for posterity but delivers all his lines through a mouthful of food in a bid to disguise a noticeable change in his speech, which I suspect is due to a new set of teeth.I don't see the point of this film. I spent the first hour trying to understand who were the villains/good guys and why? What is at stake? How is it going to be WW3? I found it hard to care what was going on or about any of the characters. That being said, Aaron Taylor Johnson played a good role. I believed he was a soldier and I was engaged. It felt as though the other actors knew I was watching and weren't really trying. Lines are mumbled, muttered and almost inaudible at times. There's too much trying to be cool and sound cool, lecturing the audience and assaulting our ears.Scenes flit from one location to another and from one day to the next. It feels like a very messy film that is trying very hard to showcase someone's intelligence rather than to entertain. There was a brief point when things got interesting and that was when you see the inversion machines used.I think Nolan has to employ more show and less tell.",Tenet

I had read reviews before mostly positive but some people complained about the music score or explosions muffling the characters taking and not understanding what is going on. Let me tell you this is not the case I could hear the dialogue clearly. The film was complicated and you do need a think outside the box attitude when watching but the film grips you pulls you in one direction and then another and although complicated plot it did make sense at the end (well almost) a few things I didn't get but some have said you benefit from watching a few times it's one of those films but I have seen some weird and complicated films that i literally have no idea what is happening and left thinking this was utter confusing for the sake of it and drivel but this is not the case with this film. If you loved memento or inception then you will love this film. If you need everything laid out for you and baby walked through each scene then you shouldn't really watch as you won't enjoy it.

However, as we see both in the critics reviews and the box office gross, the film is quite a failure.The obvious reason of this is the pointless structure of events. The audience cannot conmect with any characher and besides they dont understand the real meaning of all the action.Actually, the main characters always explain all the scientifique stuff such as they do to a child. Despite this, the whole action and the non-stop talkings mean nothing to the audience. In other words, the storytelling was simply weak.And sometimes you don't even understand the rapid talks between the characters such as it happened in the Michael Caine scene.Visually, Nolan did a great job again that's for sure but in general the movie was a disappointment (for a Nolan movie of course).",Tenet

it's really kind of movies that you have to watch more than once in order to absorb it well, that doesn't mean that it's bad movies on contrary it's very well made movie with astonishing VFX that non-CGI dependent , the only problem with it in short words that it's HARD TO BELIEVE/HARD TO UNDERSTAND.",Tenet

I think it's great when writers are imaginative, and then transfer their vision to the screen. I'm giving the the movie it's rating because of the FLAT acting of its main character... The protagonist. He shows little emotion when reciting his dialog, and it's as if he's reading from a cue card. Watch it carefully...the dialogue between characters seems very rushed... Perhaps an editing error? I just didn't buy it. I'm actually shocked that Christopher Nolan didn't use DiCaprio in the lead role. John David Washington delivered a very flat and monotone performance, at least during his conversations with others in the movie... Which is OFTEN. Elizabeth Debicki as the ""trophy wife"" of obviously one of the most powerful Russian Arms Dealers was a bit underwhelming... And I didn't buy it. Kenneth Branagh was brilliant as the Russian, he saved any scene he was in.All in all, I liked the movie itself, and maybe I'll understand if better the second watch. But one thing that won't improve is the acting of a few characters, mainly Washington. He was slightly better in Black Klansman, but not by much. Perhaps that's his acting method? To me, his dialogue ruined what could have been a Nolan masterpiece. Worth a watch, just don't expect much from the conversations. Speaking of dialogue... Yes... The sound is a problem. We had to turn on subtitles, and I have a very nice surround system. It didn't help... I found myself reading the subtitles 75-80% throughout the film.

If you know anything about me I'am a huge I mean huge fan of Christopher Nolan's films. Who made some of my favorite films including Inception, Memento, The Dark Knight, Interstellar, Batman Begins, Dunkirk, The Prestige etc. For me, I enjoy all his films and for me, he hasn't really made a bad film, for me my least favorite would be Dark Knight rises which is still a solid film (7.5/10) And so as you can tell I was very excited for this film especially the secrecy that surrounded the film, typical for Nolan films. So after anticipating this film for about a year, is it any good? Or Am I going to get Phantom Menaced, well accuse me of being a Nolan fan boy but I had one hell of a time. Tenet is a thrilling and original cerebral espionage thriller, rich in atmosphere and contains some of the most inventive action sequences I've seen in a long time, with a outstanding lead performance by John David Washington.
The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is gorgeous and the way he and Nolan film the action set pieces (of course doing 99% practical) really immerse you into the sequences. Without spoilers anything this film is very complex but never becomes convoluted, I would actually say this is one of Nolan's simplest films yet it's still very dense and after seeing it, I only understood a quarter of it but as days went on and discussed about it, the clearer it gets. Really at the heart of the film is Elizabeth Debicki storyline (who I won't spoil) which connects with Kenneth Branagh character plays a terrifying and villainous antagonist who is terrifying, but the actor who steals the show is Robert Pattinson as Neil, every scene he steals and after giving us excellent performances in Good Time, High Life, The King, The Rover and now thi,s he has become of the best actors working in the industry and has gone a long way from being the pretty boy from twilight and has become a excellent actor. And I believe he'll give us the best batman.( I stand by that) Overall I enjoyed the hell out of this film and had a great time, A nice and welcome return to the cinemas. 8.5- 9/10 for me.

All the better.Primed now to pay attention, I enjoyed it very much the second time round. Great cinematography, great colour palettes, great sound track, great adventure. The things that are unexplained and perhaps open to discussion, are not failures but features - the Protagonists role in the future adds a nice twist to end.Great acting too. It can't be easy playing a role involving violence to women in these times, but Branagh deals with this challenge well. I don't know how tall Elizabeth Debicki is, but she's playing very tall and thin here. Love the cameo by Sir Michael. Some cheeky dialogue there.I speculate on what an ""Inception II"" would or could be, now I'll be speculating what ""Tenet II"" cd/wd be. It's the director's fault, of course.

I feel if those complaints focused on the direction of what was being presented it would put things in full perspective. Which makes this movie twice as amazing. Truly. A masterpiece. Don't be fooled by the bad reviews. Just give it your attention and you will see. Don't try to understand it. Feel it.",Tenet
2145,barisaxnate,"Technically And Visually Amazing, but Cold and Emotionless",5,3 September 2020,"I know people will disagree, but I didn't connect to this movie at all on an emotional level. It really lacked any heart or emotion. It is so exposition heavy and plot driven that the characters are all very flat. Their delivery is also lacking in emotion. I won't go in to plot, but it was very confusing. Even with all the exposition, I still felt certain things were underexplained. It was also very difficult to understand much of the dialogue because of music, sound design, accents, etc. The movie was too LOUD. I saw it in IMAX, which may be why. Nolan's movies are very loud though generally. The visuals and the action of the film are the stand-outs for me. These scenes are very exciting, despite my many confusions.
One last thing, if you are sensitive to gun violence, skip this movie. The opening scene is very abrupt and evocative. Overall, despite the technical excellence and brilliance of Nolan, this film was colder than my dad in an Arctic snowstorm.",Tenet
2146,buffyfan_ieuan,So dispointing,2,31 August 2020,"This film was beyond disappointing. I usually love Christopher Nolan movies and went in with an open mind not knowing much about the plot.
The writing is nonsensical in parts and just annoying or lazy in others. I couldn't tell if the characters dialogue was bad or if the acting was bad. There are no personalities to be found and the leads are all boring people that you struggle to care about. Why does the lead keep calling himself a protagonist and calling people antagonists? It's just weird.
There could have been quite a lot more edited out and some storylines just felt straight up useless, the film is too long and the villain... What a stupid useless reason for his end goal.",Tenet

2148,d5454,A Display of Christopher Nolan's Strengths,9,2 September 2020,"Nolan fanatics like myself expected a masterpiece from this film. However, it did not quite live up to that potential. There were times when it felt like a rehash of Inception, and other times when it felt like a ripoff of James Bond. Although, homage is not necessarily a weakness in the art of filmmaking. Nolan's high concept scope was alive and well in this entry. The amount of work that must have went into writing and editing had to have been one of the most ambitious endeavors in the history of original film, and it for the most part succeeded with a bang.Considering Nolan's penchant for practical effects, there were moments when one might think, ""how in the world did he just pull that off?"" The actors held themselves incredibly well for such a complicated and bonkers script, and the relatively predictable twists and stock character archetypes did not take away from the intellect of the concept. Espionage films have had a long standing history in cinema. Nolan is not only a practitioner of them, he is a fan. He sought out to make an original contribution to serve as a love letter, just as much as it was to serve as a thinking piece. He certainly succeeded. Was it a perfect movie? No, but in regard to its overall strengths, it was nothing short of spectacular.",Tenet

Probably that is the reason why mostly I understood the movie, I watched netflix's Dark several times""One thing I did not like - if understood correctly -> Unfortunately we do not know where this very unique technology came from exactly.

2152,thevision-44664,Tenet: Movie Review,10,30 December 2020,"There are very few movies where if it's plot is complex, difficult to follow and understand but still we get glued in with a genuine interest and excitement without even bothering to look at if any flaws are there or not. Tenet, for me, is and will be on No. 1 if such ever list for movies is made.The movie is about John David Washington's character, the Secret Agent, having no name so he's just called The Protagonist, embarking on a time bending mission to stop what they think will incept World War 3 in worse way.
Firstly, the acting is great. Not a bad side or weakness found in the acting. Washington portrays his ""no-named"" The Protagonist dazzingly. Being a secret secret James Bond. Pattinson is such a treat to watch as Neil. Who is so mysterious, just as The Protagonist. The chemistry between them is also one of highlights of the movie. Elizabeth Debicki's Kat Sator gives the movie that emotional setup the movie needs. About how much she's going through and how much Washington's character really cares for her cause of her situation. She nailed her role. Sir Kenneth Branagh is really in his game here. His portrayal of the eccentric and cruel Russian oligarch Andrei Sator is brilliant. He makes you hate him. He's such an Intelligent as well as Cruel Villain. Dimple Kapadia is in the movie for like 7-8 minutes but really nails it. She proves her authenticity and glad to see Indian talent in such a lead.The storyline and screenplay of the movie is something out of this world. You'll scratch your heads. But as the revelations occur, it's something Jaw-Dropping. It hits you in your face. The action is spectacular. Especially the choreography of something or someone is Inverted Backwards while the other is Forward. Hoyte Van Hoytema deserves the Academy Award for his astonishing cinematography. So does Ludwig Göransson for his bone chilling background scores. The entire theatre was shaking with his beats and tunes. The soundtrack created more and more intensity in every sequence.
The only flaw can be noticed is of the sound mixing. It's too loud sometimes. But not as bad as other critics and people describe.Overall saying, this is my favorite Christopher Nolan movie ever. It has that emotional impact too. Especially when you realise what happened, what was about to happen and what will happen. Don't know why some people describe it as ""Emotion-less"". In fact my FAVORITE MOVIE of all time. It's only cause of I've seen many movies.. loads of genres and loads of flicks. But I've NEVER seen anything like this. This movie is way ahead of our time. Each and every sequence captivates you with it's Pure Brilliance. And it's sooo complex, i really warn those who don't like to bend their minds for movies, they'll be bothered. Cause this Masterpiece is just a Rubik's Cube. As much as you dig deep you'll love it more and more. With new details popping out everytime. Personally, this movie moved me and amazed me on a whole another level. I don't know what to say for those who didn't liked it or calling it Nolan's worst. I just wanna say Nolan is far too intelligent and advanced that he gave us a movie which is way ahead of our time. He deserves an Oscar this time for sure. Mark my words, this movie will go down as One Of The Greatest Movies in Cinema. It needs more appreciation honestly. Because this is how you perform a concept. Especially a concept like ""Time Travel"". So brilliantly, unique and intelligently. This execution makes more sense than the time travel flicks we usually get. Requires multiple viewings.So for me Tenet is nothing short from being a CAPTIVATING MASTERPIECE.Tenet: 5/5 Stars.",Tenet

Tenet is a two-and-a-half hour thrill ride that rivals Bond films of the past, but with a heavy dose of those Nolan mind games that his fans know and love.

2164,cineast78,CONFUSE THE ... CAT!,6,1 September 2020,"I think this movie will divide viewers into 3 groups:1.) The group that thinks that this movie is a flawless masterpiece, like everything Christopher Nolan does, has ever done, and will ever do.2.) The group that argues that this movie is a vastly overrated pile of garbage, and who give the movie a lot of hate because they are angry about the brainless praise this movie gets from the Nolan fanboys.3.) The group that thinks that this movie had potential and is certainly not ""the worst Nolan ever"" (which is in fact ""Insomnia""), but still has a lot problems and is way too confusing.Needless to say, I belong to group 3.What I certainly like about this movie is that it encourages interesting thoughts about time travel. And you can see how much effort went into the production.But let's be honest: this movie has a lot of problems. A lot of logical holes and inconsistencies. Bad sound-mix. Bad dialogue which lacks build-up. Superficial characters which are hard to care about. Wooden fatuous acting, especially from the lead actor. Bad overloaded script with characters and a story whose only purpose is to serve the pretentious plot line. And A LOT of unnecessary (and maybe intentional) confusion for the sake of confusion.It looks like Nolan overstrained himself with this one. And like actors and even more so producers failed to restrain Nolan from going too wild with his ideas without anyone checking on whether the whole thing would work.I didn't hate it - but I didn't love it either. And I wish people would stop praising it as a masterpiece which it certainly is not and admit that the movie has a lot of problems.And if you have a cat that is moping all day and badly needs to be confused out of its rut and you cannot afford the services of Confuse-A-Cat Ltd., just show it this movie - it'll do the job just fine!",Tenet

However, the characters are so dull - many of them serve simply as exposition mouthpieces, and their motivations/goals remain obscure. As a result, the movie feels emotionally cold and dull, and the already hard-to-follow narrative becomes near-impossible to connect with and care about.",Tenet
2168,Aman1017,We Live in a Twilight World...,10,3 September 2020,"What can I say? Christopher Nolan brings us another one of his unique and mind-twisting stories in a way that only he and his team can deliver in Tenet. Movies truly do not get much better than this. To really grasp the understanding this film, multiple viewing will be necessary.Everything about this movie met my expectations, if not exceeded it. Tenet is a masterpiece! Bravo to everyone who worked on this movie. Will it be the savior for movie theatres and revive the movie-going experience? Well, I can't speak for others but I can tell you this; There were hardly any slow moments. Tenet was action-packed from the beginning to the end. The cinematography was very captivating to my eyes. The costumes looked so appealing. The score by Ludwig Göransson was as expected; fantastic. I've been listening to the soundtrack all week. And the story is one that only Christopher Nolan and his team could bring to life, flawlessly. Yes, it is very confusing. Trust me, give it time to grow on you so you can put the pieces together and complete the puzzle. After all, this is a Christopher Nolan movie we're talking about.John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, and the remainder of the cast were so impressive! I expected them to give great performances but they really gave it their all in Tenet. Nolan knows how to bring together a wonderful cast and have them work together perfectly. You can feel the chemistry between the characters throughout the whole movie.I first saw it in an AMC IMAX theatre and it was so wild that my adrenaline was through the roof the whole time! My one complaint would be the sound mixing. Sometimes it was hard to understand what the characters were saying because the score and sound effects would sometimes play over them and drown out the word. After my second and third viewing, I loved the movie even more. I understood it better and I focused much harder. Plus, I went to Regal those two times where the sound was easier for me to follow and understand the characters.Many people also say that there wasn't enough emotion put into The Protagonist's character and there wasn't much of a background story. To me, I'm perfectly fine with that. The mystery behind this whole film is another factor that makes Tenet worth watching many times. To me, he goes by John.To conclude, Tenet isn't your ordinary time movie. It so original in a way that it portrays time so differently from other time movies through the use of inversion and Nolan's intelligence. After seeing it 3 times already and watching countless hours of Tenet trailers, I'm still not finished understanding Tenet completely. It was truly mind-blowing and I would recommend everyone to watch it in an IMAx theatre first. A century from now, Christopher Nolan will still be talked about as one of the greatest directors ever.",Tenet

2171,davidjunderwood,"See this at Noon/1200H or 2:00 PM/1400H, so You Can Be As Sharp As Possible",8,3 September 2020,"I am reviewing this movie after one watch and I have to say I quite liked it, and I do think I understood most of the key premises. I may have missed a few of the smaller details, which I hopefully will pick up on a re-watch. However, I went with two other people who did not get this movie and absolutely hated it. This is why you have to give this movie your full attention, because if not you will lose track of what is happening and be miserable for the next two hours. Also, I am an American and native English speaker, so I don't know how difficult it would be to watched this movie subtitled or dubbed. I like foreign movies, but I do know the negative of missing a line of dialogue, camera set-up, or movement from an actor because you have to so quickly read the subtitles. This causes me to be afraid that you will miss a lot if you are from a non-english speaking country, but I hope this is not the case.
""Tenet"" is both a philosophical science fiction movie and a complex thriller. I would say this makes it harder to understand than previous Nolan movies such as ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception,"" because those movies had traits of being a super-hero or heist movie which are genres audiences are more familiar with.
I think I am done talking about the complexities and would like to talk about the pros of this movie. The cast, except for Brannagh who is good not great, does a really good job with making characters with very little characterization, which is a con I will talk about, feel real. An example of this is some of Washington's humor. He is not a funny character, but he makes some smart aleck responses which makes his cold character feel more human. Overall, Washington and Pattinson were very good casting choices. Another pro is the choreography. This movie's action scenes are incredibly unique and the spectacle of seeing them are amazing. A subject related to this is Nolan's use of motion/blocking in a frame. Nolan as a director has a lot of movement in his scenes, whether they be actions or exposition scenes, which makes exposition scenes, which there are several of, be much more interesting than they would be by a lesser director. The payoffs of this movie. I would say there are scenes from earlier in this movie that you end up appreciating a lot more about 2/3rds of the way through, which makes me appreciate the earlier scenes a lot more.
The cons. I don't like being negative and I do like that Nolan is making blockbusters that are nothing like any other blockbusters around, but ""Tenet"" does have a few flaws. The characterization, I praised the cast earlier, but I think they did a great job with the little amount of character they had. The script gives very little time to the characters to allow them develop as people. Mainly because, it is so focused on moving the plot forward. I do think that the movie could have been a little bit better if it added about 15 minutes of characterization besides the plot, so we could care more about the characters in the epic situations they are in. The sound is a major problem. You may read other reviews criticizing the sound, and these views are correct. The sounder mixer and Nolan put too much emphasis on the sound effects and score. This leads to you being unable to hear the dialogue at points. This is a real negative because the dialogue is so important. I am younger and my hearing is probably better than the average person's, but if you are in your forties, fifties, or older this may be a real problem which SHOULD have been avoided. I am hoping that this problem will be re-mixed either while it is still in theatres or before it goes onto blu-ray and digital, because it is inexcusable. My final con is that it is too big at times. ""Tenet"" is one of the most massive movies of all time. It is up there with ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Ran,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and ""Avengers: Endgame."" This leads to there being great spectacle, but sometimes it is a little too much. I will give a non-spoiler example. There is a scene where Washington does pull-ups inside a windmill, at a deadly height if he falls. I get what this scene is saying in terms of his character, but sometimes just how huge it is separates us from the characters.
I'm impressed if you are still reading this, but don't worry I will end it soon. I hated going on about the cons for so long, because I really liked this movie. I like Nolan as a director, but I was really disappointed in ""Interstellar"" and ""Dunkirk,"" but I would re-watch ""Dunkirk"" to see if I like it more (I have watched ""Interstellar"" twice and just was never into it). ""Tenet"" was the first time for awhile that I felt I was watching the incredible Nolan who made ""The Dark Knight Trilogy."" So, please I understand if you don't watch this in theatres because of the pandemic, I felt really nervous and went to a Wednesday showing. However, whenever you can watch it and feel safe, please don't be scared off because you heard from a friend or the internet that this is complicated, this movie really deserves a watch.",Tenet
2172,matthewdimarino,How did this movie get green lit?,3,1 December 2020,"I don't normally post reviews unless I feel strongly about a good or bad movie that may get miss guided reviews. In this case, I am surprised Tenet was actually given a budget to create such a big movie that had such a poor storyline. It was like Nolan tried to create another Inception including the obscure soundtrack, but the recipe didn't work at all this time. Time travel is always a great sci-fi subject if done well, and sometimes simplicity works better but the inverse/backwards time travel is not very entertaining nor interesting enough to invest 2.5 hours on. The main actors are definitely not to blame, but the lines for Russian bad guy K. Branagh were so long winded and meant to be meaningful but ended up being mumbled cliches that could put a kid to sleep instead of threatening. I didn't even understand who was fighting who and what they were fighting for, just a major let down that looked so promising from the trailers.",Tenet

The story/plot- not new but was very hard to execute and Nolan did it better than anyone could have imagined, if you think it is not well done, you are very welcome to try it. The soundtrack- now this is where the problem was, it seemed as if the mixing had been done in a hurry ( especially in the intro) since the music overshadowed the dialogues ( subtitles saved me lol), but still it is unique and great like it has always been. Cinematography- top notch, don't even argue. Acting/actors - not bad but could have been better.

I enjoy Nolan's flim in that way that all that you see is never what it is. This film for me really took cinematography and capture to the next level. The rawness and realistic visuals were unmatched to anything I've seen to date. Watching I just thought, how much meticulous work it must have taken from inception (lol pun intended) to execution to make it all happen in reverse order. 2. The paradox of future vs past and time being non-linear.
The one down side was the dialogue was sometimes hard to hear. I'll admit I enjoyed the action and the story line but parts where an explanation of what was happening or going to happen was explained in very turbulent settings. So you kind of had to assume what was going on or just ignore parts of the story and just sit back and enjoy the visuals and action. The cast was amazing as well! Happy to see Mr. Washington lead at the fore front of the story and not as a supporting role. But I did keep thinking about his character in Ballers and also some facial expressions and mannerisms he's definitely picked up from his pops! All in all, I'll definitely see it again either in the theater or at home (with subtitles). :)",Tenet
2175,JMaekelae,A modern Bond without the swagger,5,29 August 2020,"Tenet is a mediocre agent movie with a somewhat forced sci-fi twist. While well executed from a technical viewpoint, one can't help but notice a serious lack of artistry, tension or emotion. What on earth has happened to Nolan? There are no images that leave you stunned. No moments that make you hold on to your seat or gasping for breath. None of the characters have any kind of depth, which means that you couldn't care less what happens to them. Or to the world these hollow shells inhabit.There is plenty of action in various locations around the world, which at times makes Tenet seem like a Bond ripoff. But unfortunately the heart is missing. There's none of the style, the cool, the swagger, that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies ooze every minute. The scene with Michael Caine carries loads of that. Sadly enough, a couple of minutes later the momentum is lost again.Even with the bold time-bending gimmick, Tenet still feels like a generic action flick.

""James Bond on steroids"" was the ad....James Bond on craic cocaine maybe!
Part of the opening violence included the protaganist having his teeth pulled out by a Russian baddie... and this film was classed suitable for 12's in Ireland???? I'd ask for my money back, though I know what I'd be told.. Don't waste your time and money on this one is my advice",Tenet

I definitely think I need to watch Tenet again. most people say it's disappointing at first watch, but a masterpiece at second. On my first and only watch it was incredibly confused. I was blown away by the visuals and the direction like always, but the plot and characters were very flawed. Most of the characters except for the villian had no personality whatsoever.

Could be in the same league with interstellar and inception, but unfortunately Nolan decides the build the movie on saving the villain's wife and her son. When the protagonist saved the world he exchanges the hope of humanity with the villain's wife? A trained CIA officer drops the mission and decides to save the woman he had seen in his life for 15 min. LOL. If this movie was built on the brotherly relationship with the protagonist and his side kick Robert Pattison; this movie would have its place next to interstellar, inception and many other Nolan masterpieces. But no, we're gonna save this woman's child that has nothing to do with the plot and that we only see him for 2 seconds.",Tenet

As my wife and me starting watching this film it was incredible hard to stay by the movie for the first 90 min. It was hard to me, because I was curious about the ending. The movie lost my wife after approximately 45 min, she stands up and starts reading E-Mails on her laptop. So, how can I rate this movie still with a six?1. You will understand only a little bit in the first half of the film and the physical construct which is used to explain the ""time effects / travel"" is hard to believe.
2. The explanation is nice made but comes to late.
3. The music and sound effects are incredible terrible and annoying.
4. The acting is average and neither bad or good but far away from outstanding (best actor in movie Kenneth Branagh)
5. The plot background idea: The future attacks us to annihilate us because we such environment asses"" is literally bullshxx! Who came up with this nonsense? By this plot the future will commit suicide by kill their own past. Unbelievable.
6. How can you make a movie which you have to watch twice to understand you've to bare an incredible boring first half. I watched several time on my watch only to check if it's over soon.So you read all my points and there is still the question why a six. There are two points which a levelling the movie back over and average 5.1. Due to the end I definitively want to rewatch the movie to better unterstand the first half. And maybe I'm able to enjoy the first half.
2. The movie made me think about it over the night and this is a really rare impact.So I will see the movie a second time. Alone. And if I still don't enjoy the first half, it will drop to 3 star movie.",Tenet

I have watched it three times in three different theaters. The first had no problem with the sound, the second had a problem which is very small and the third one had a very bad sound problem. My point is that probably some of the theaters didn't test the sound because the sound should be lowered. It is not because of the movie since I watched once with no problem. Actually, it is a problem for some theaters. They need to decrease the level of the sound probably the decibel level is too high for their speakers.Additionally, I understood the movie during the first watch.

First, the complexity is a fair amount less than the intriguing and dark television series ""Dark"", which is popular on streaming right now.

He just looked extremely uncomfortable, trying to figure out which is the best expression to use for his lines.
Robert Pattinson wasn't bad at all.
Maybe if they used the exact same cast of Inception, it would have been more convincing. That's about it. It has the usual Nolan touch of convoluted but interesting plotlines.

2190,samuel_bns,Lacking any soul and sound clarity,4,7 September 2020,"As many others reviewing here, I love Nolan's work and I never thought I'd be giving his movie any less than an 8. Boy was I wrong.Sound
After the seeing Tenet in IMAX, I am shocked that someone actually okay-ed this to be released into cinemas. I have no idea what anyone was saying for about 80% of the movie.
I read somewhere that it's up to the cinemas to control the sound levels, but how come it's not such a major problem with other movies and the issue is so consistent worldwide? What a joke.Characters and storyline
Even if the dialog was crystal clear, here's where the movie lacks the most. The core of most Nolan's movies lies in a character or a human quality that viewers can relate to, set in an awesome-concept universe. The concept was secondary, while the human quality was usually the primary focus of the movie.
Tenet flips that around. The time-inversion is the core of the movie, while the characters are just there and stuff is happening to them. From the very little information I gathered from the dialogue, there is absolutely no background to them, not even the main protagonist (pun intended), no motivation, very little charm, and no relatability. The story is full of clichés and old tropes that were cringeworthy at best. I did not care if anyone survives or reaches their goal. That was the most disappointing part for me.Visuals and action
The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because at least most of the action scenes were quite entertaining. The special FX and visuals were beautiful and fun to watch. On the other hand, in my opinion they don't compare to the stuff we got to see in Interstellar or Inception.All in all, I do not recommend this movie. It's painfully long and forgettable. I hope Nolan will surprise us again in the future, but for now, I will stick to re-watching his previous fantastic works. Though many reviewers suggest it, I will not watch Tenet again to 'comprehend its genius'. It had its chance with me and failed terribly.",Tenet

Do yourself a favour and purchase the Blu Ray and slowly watch it backwards (this way it will seem forwards)! Don't worry about the dialogue being gibberish. It is. Forwards OR backwards.

For the life of me I cannot fathom why in one moment the sound is earsplittingly loud and then the next moment the characters are mumbling incoherently as they discuss crucial plot elements.I have heard some people say that Nolan became so in love with his own idea and dialogue that actually hearing the lines spoken became meaningless for him.Other people have said he made The film this way in order to intentionally require people to see it twice to really understand it. Or to have to stream it at home with closed captions.I do not know what the true story is but I can tell you this. If 1000 people try to watch this movie without subtitles and without actively holding the remote control in their hands to turn the volume up and down at key moments, more than 900 of them will be frustrated and not understand the movie.The fact that this movie was released in this format suggests that Nolan has surrounded himself with people who are afraid to tell him the truth.

1. Bad sound mixing on top of actors mumbling and whispering their lines.2. The characters are dull with no soul. Most of them are stone faced ice queens and kings, too cool to show any humanity. This makes them unrelatable and unlikable, do we care if they die/get hurt? Not really.3. Pattinson should have been given the lead. He has way more charm and charisma than JDW, heck he even smiles. But his casting as lead wouldn't have been woke enough...4. The plot, though inspired and with a lot of potential, is a jumbled mess.

Bad Russian or Russian affiliated arm dealer wanted to destroy the world for whatever reason. American hero and his allies saved the world. The same concept throughout hollywood movies that has become empty and hard to emotionally invest in the movie. The acting was okay. None of the actor or actress acted in a conceiving way. In long dialogue scence, I rarely felt the emotion behind the lines. I didn't believe the actors and actresses understand or believe in their lines. The whole Nolan style mind twisting plots just became a game for audience to participate and brag about their intellegince later as ""I am so smart that I watched Tenet and understand it!"" So what? The whole movie is based on a self-centered, seemed nobel concept, to serve director's own self worshiping ego. Neither time traveling nor nuclear weapon ends the world is a new concept.

This movie is ground-breaking in it's own right, having personally never seen a fight sequence where the two opponents are fighting in two directions of time.

2206,sam_putra,Not Nolan's best but still enjoyable to watch,7,29 December 2020,"I think we all can agree that Nolan is one of the best conceptual writers working today. It's hard to write this review without comparing this movie to his other films. Like Interstellar and Inception, Tenet gives you a mind bending experience throughout the whole movie. The challenge is, how do you tell such a complex concept to the audience?The first problem with Tenet is that there are too many information given through dialogues in order to make the audience understand the concept, pressuring the audience to think instead of experiencing the movie.The second problem is, unlike Interstellar and Inception, the character's motivation in this movie is always unclear. In Inception, you have a protagonist who just want to get home to see his kids, and that motivation is always clear throughout the film, and same goes with Interstellar. In Tenet, I'm struggling to find something that I can relate to the protagonist. As a result, the ending is not as impactful as other Nolan's films. A concept can be complex, but a character's motivation should be simple.Regardless, the movie is still enjoyable to watch. Big production, insane practical effect, thoughtful choreograph (since they are fighting backward), and the music score in this movie is so good despite not having Hans Zimmer as the composer as Nolan always did, the movie has a strong personality carried by the music.

I'm all for a detailed plot with intelligent actors playing their parts to perfection but even they must have thought what's going on, what did I do and what was that last scene all about, just to further confuse the paying punters (only 5 in the cinema) let's all mumble most of our lines and crank the music up to headache inducing sound levels. I love a movie, I love to be entertained and can appreciate well acted, well understood dialogue with a plot that makes at least a reasonable stab at being seen,heard and understood. This came across as a bit of pretentious posturing at how clever am I putting all this together.Rated at 6 for the effort put in by the cast to complete the film, but I suppose they all got well paid and Sir Michael Caine probably can't believe he is still getting the call, but jobs for the boys (Batman) goes on in every walk of life.",Tenet

This movie .......I don't know how to describe how I feel about it. I watched it yesterday and being honest I feel like I have a better understanding of the movie now than while I was watching it in time. And that's not a bad thing! Most of Christopher Nolan's films make me feel this way. This movie is very complex in a good way. There are so many layers and seeing them all unfold and intertwine during the movie was really interesting.I love the complexity of the characters too. Each new face you see on the screen, you pay close attention to. With, that being said, each character is well developed even the antagonist, Andrie Sator (Kenneth Branagh). My major pet peeve is when the quote on quote bad guy is just that ...a bad guy. Kenneth Branagh did a good job making me intrigued by the backstory of his character and trying to figure out his thinking. I also liked watching the scenes between his character and Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). You could always feel the tension between the two, and you believed whatever emotions they were acting out. It made you feel uncomfortable for Kat to be around Andrie, but that is the point. I think the arc that they gave Kat toward the end was great.I also loved the dynamic between Neil (Robert Patterson) and ""The Protagonist"" (John David Washington). They just clicked. You could see the blooming of friendship on-screen. I loved it.Now the action scenes in this movie are going to be talked about and analyzed for a long time. I think these scenes were what I enjoyed the most out of the whole movie. This movie changes the way you perceive and think about motion. The fights could be viewed in so many ways, and each would convey something totally different.And the cinematography. Not only was this a cool concept, but it was an aesthetically pleasing movie to look at. Every angle felt intentional, and it was so cool to see the way Christopher Nolan portrayed time going backwards on screen. Christopher Nolan's mind is beautiful.I think everyone should watch this movie sometime. If you like movies that have many layers and easter eggs, this is the movie for you. You won't stop thinking about this movie for days. Everything is connected; a never-ending loop.",Tenet
2214,hafzm-22115,The Fall of Christopher Nolan,8,8 December 2020,"Whoever watched Nolan's last film TENET and had seen all his previous films will know perfectly well that it is an excellent film, no less beautiful than the rest of his films, and is not more difficult than it, rather it is easier to understand because it talks about unalterable physical paradoxes, not psychological as it was in the movie Memento, for example, which was Leonard Schlippi creates convictions in his mind and records them on his body for innocent people that they are the ones who raped and killed his wife, in order to pursue them and kill them, not to avenge them, but to find a reason to live for him ..But the problem with TENET and the reason for all the criticism revolves around two things ..
The first is that the hero of the movie ""John Washington"" has a poor performance compared to the previous heroes of Nolan's difficult stories. He is not Leonardo, Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, not even Guy Pearce ... he is an average actor. It is true that he performed well, but not as good as his others ..And the second thing, and the most important thing, is that Nolan presented a purely rule-based scientific film without any human side or any aspect that causes people to love the film .. I mean here the passion and ""love"" and the family that Nolan embodied in this work with the story of a wife and mother, and it was a very weak story And ineffective .. For example in the movie Inception, who among us forgets the scene of Marion Cotillard's suicide in order to perpetuate her and her husband Leonardo .. And who among us forgets the relationship of McConaughey with his daughter and his painful crying for her while he is in the fifth dimension in the movie Interstellar or the scene of his meeting with her while she is an old dying Young man .. precisely these moments made the legendary Nolan's films and his name .. and not at all the rules of scientific and philosophies that he was proposing, nor the embodiments and the visual and audio effects that he used .. Nolan was in this film only presenting complex physical rules related to going back in time and scientific-physical paradoxes It cannot be applied in reality, impressive action scenes, a fun and exciting story, but this plot was missing. The most important thing is the focus of Nolan's stories in all of his films ... which is the human aspect of the story, human emotion and ""love."" We are not computers or machines to be applied All of these tasks and rules are meticulously without any error or any important humanitarian goal ... and here was Nolan's fall.",Tenet

2216,cornelia123,A film full of 'puzzles' does not necessary make it interesting,3,26 August 2020,"I saw Tenet today in London nd I have to say that I was profoundly bored. Yes, there are good action scenes but inbetween these scenes (which aren't even that great) there are many boring moments. All the little puzzles does not maketh a good nor interesting film. Like I was thinking throughout 'who cares?' The 'villain' was a total cartoonish stereotype, and the plot stupid. I did not feel for one second that the world was truly in danger. The characters go forward in time then backwards then forward again then backwards, inverted, reverted, inverted again, you get the picture. It seems like the special effects are more important than the characters and the plot itself. I didn't like any of the characters btw, except perhaps Robert Pattinson's. I actually went to see the film because I quite like his recent films and enjoy his acting. He was good in this, although I imagine it was a walk in the park for him as there was nothing 'difficult' about his role at all. The protagonist was 'so so'. I don't blame the actor, as he didn't have much to chew on...because what's paramount in the film are the action scenes and the special effects. The 'dame in distress' was a total bore, and it was not believable that the 'protagonist' would even care about her as much as he did. It also didn't help that sometimes it was too dark to see properly, and that the sound was muffled and you could not make out what the characters were saying. I'm giving it a 5/10 because it has some okay scenes. So would I recommend it? It depends. If you are a Nolan nutter who thinks he urinates gold, yes, go ahead, you'll love it. If however you are into more character driven, brilliant acting and cinematography, and more arty type of films, no, because you won't be impressed. Perhaps dubbed into another language by charismatic actors, maybe it would even make the film more interesting, but as it is, in the original version, it isn't very good. Edit: After a few days' consideration, and after seeing it again from the comfort of my own home, I realise what a truly awful film Tenet is and I have now changed my rating to 3/10 (and that's me being generous). I'm sorry but I cannot forgive how poorly written and what cliches the 'villain' and the wifey were, nor the lack of charisma of the 'protagonist', nor the rubbish sound that was done on purpose in order for repeat viewings and more money in their pockets. Shame on Nolan for treating cinema goers with contempt.",Tenet
2217,timeuschristiansunder,UNDERRATED! HAS EXCELLENT CONCEPT,10,6 August 2021,"A terrific concept thought of, yet again by the great CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. Only he could think, ""What if action scenes went in reverse?"" This film is the classic puzzle you expect from Chris Nolan with nonstop entertainment and tension carefully crafted by him. He draws you in with the visual effects and keeps you there with some splendid directing. The exposition is a touch heavy only because there is so much to say. But I'm nitpicking when I say he could deliver the exposition like Kubrick in 2001: A space Odyssey. He has done it before and it's possible he may have gotten a touch lazy in his writing. But, nevertheless, this film does not deserve the hate it receives. That's just one man's opinion.",Tenet
2218,micahlhaddad,This movie rewards you for seeing it again.,8,12 September 2020,"I'm not gonna lie, first viewing was a big letdown. As a Nolan fan myself, I was shocked to see what I considered ""annoying bad"" writing and sound design. The sound design still is a problem as of writing this, but upon second viewing, it was like a little switch flicked on every time I saw something I didn't understand from the last viewing. The little details that I considered bad writing suddenly seemed like an obvious answer. The cheesy parts I thought were, well cheesy, had so much more depth. I'm not going to spoil it, but thinking about The Protagonist and Neil makes me feel so many emotions that upon second viewing never made me feel the way I did, truly beautiful. No movie is perfect, this one definitely isn't perfect. This is no Dunkirk or Inception, but I guarantee this movie will make you use your brain.",Tenet

The biggest plot hole for me is that if they can go back in time, why didn't they just go back to before Sator built the Algorithm and just kill him, then you could basically have saved 90% of the film!
But what makes this film particularly bad is that the whole concept of how inversion works is so complicated and badly explained, that the viewer is completely baffled as to what is going on. And to top it all off, the actors seem to accept everything that is going on as if it's just a daily occurrence to see time travel and stuff going backwards everywhere.
i Spent so much of the film trying to understand what the heck was going on, that the GOOD parts of the film passed me by. With a more coherent plot, this film could have been amazing, but sadly it's let down by bad film making.",Tenet

It just about seems possible but is confusing enough to still baffle you. I feel like it was slightly under utilised in creating cool storylines, it's not that clever that HE was the one running the show all along I think. That being said I loved the way he was able to fight himself and Robert Pattison at the same time, inverted and not. The last battle is a bit of a wash too, you never see anyone they're fighting and the temporal pincer movement tactic doesn't isn't obviously advantageous, but seeing half your army limping off as soon as you arrive was a clever foreshadowing.The soundtrack banged and seemed like it was never turned off so your heart rate doesn't get a chance to drop below 100bpm.

I was expecting something much more spectacular from the action scenes but they were pretty underwhelming and tried to overcompensate with the soundtrack.
As for the acting I found Washington quite wooden and lacked any emotion at all, even when certain scenes warranted it. Pattinson's accent changes throughout the film, sounding like an oxford schoolboy one minute then a fake American accent next. Same goes for Taylor-Johnson, who switched between some sort of U.K. accent, American and Australian, sometimes during the same sentence.
Too much thought went into trying to explain the over complicated storyline compared to focusing on the acting.",Tenet

People saying you have to watch It more than once, well I did watch it a second time and hated it even more.

Like my brother said, they could have used the exact same cast as inception and this would have been a much better movie. The great Denzel Washington himself could have carried the movie alone on his shoulders as the lead.
Denzel Washington's son was just such a wrong choice. It seemed he was trying to work out the correct facial expression to use in most of the scenes. And that stupid walk.Johnathan Nolan was missing in this movie. Maybe he's the missing link which makes his movies great?The opening scene was spookily similar to TDK which is a very un Nolan thing in my humble opinion because each movie of his is so varied and full of surprises.",Tenet

I'm quite sure I haven't fully understood this film, just barely enough to have fun. It's challenging, but rewarding. It's weirdly poetic with it's sort of palindrome construction. I'm sure that after future viewings my understanding, and rating, of ""Tenet"" will increase. Time will tell if it's layered or just convoluted. But it's Christopher Nolan, what else do you expect?

I also found it a little irritating that the cast looked so PC : Brits, Indians (female arms dealer) an Afro American protagonist...

2232,Spiderboy810,Christopher Nolan at his best,10,4 July 2021,"A few months ago, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" got a rather big resurgence online, probably due to the Snyder Cut of ""Justice League"" coming out, and a lot of people realized how good the movie was. Everyone kept talking about how well the movie aged and that now, they understand all of the nuances and political commentary that lied within (myself included). Long story short, people realized how smart the movie was, and it made people also realize how great the movie is. That's how I think people will look back at ""Tenet"" Sure, all of Christopher Nolan's movies can be seen as very complex and occasionally a little hard to follow, but ""Tenet"" is beyond that. It takes the plot device of time travel, an already rather confusing idea, and dials it up to 10,000. Normal and inverted characters interacting with each other, people being in multiple places at once, people setting up thing in the past so they can occur in the future, people setting things up in the future so that can occur in the past, it gets absolutely insane. And I love it. A lot of people said they had to watch it a second time in order to understand it, and while I got it on my first viewing, I can see how some people might need that. It's such a brilliant film, and yet so many people didn't like because it was to complex, and it's a shame. Maybe in a few years, people will remember this and decide to come back to it. Maybe then, it'll get the love it deserves.",Tenet

2234,arctichome,"Not necessary to watch once, much less twice.",2,21 December 2020,"35 minutes into watching this, my buddy and I turned to each other sort of baffled and asked ""this really sucks, doesn't it?"". Then we marveled at the fact that only 35 minutes had gone by, as it felt like an hour.This is a heartless film, and, despite years of tinkering, doesn't make any sense, because time travel is inherently nonsensical. People who say you need to watch it twice to understand are delusional, because time travel has never been logically consistent in any story. It's always a paradox, and therefore always impossible. It's a fun idea you can use to set up an unusual scenario, but any story that focuses on the time travel concept more than characters and situations is doomed to failure, and that's the case with ""Tenet"".The movie has no characters to invest in. They're unrelatable, inconsistent, and boring. For example, the protagonist is at once an ultra badass that can take out a dozen goons with his bare hands and not scuff his expensive suit, and also the kind of guy to be manhandled by one or two goons when the story needs him to be helpless. And why the hell does he care about the woman? They have no history or chemistry. His drive is not explained.It could all be somewhat salvaged (maybe a 5 out of 10) if there was at least some major spectacle on display, but the set pieces were all very underwhelming, and often just funny. First off, there's literally no ""wow"" factor to seeing video played in reverse 120 years after movies have become commonplace, so the ""inverted object"" scenes were a yawn. The ""REAL AIRPLANE CRASH"" was just a fender bender; proving real is not always better. And the big battle at the end is comical with half the soldiers running backwards, they look like such tools; but at least that aspect was entertaining, because the editing for the rest of the action sure wasn't.Nonsense can be fun. Characters don't have to be great for a movie to be worth watching. Action can be subpar and still be of positive service to a film. But if your movie makes no sense, has no good characters, and the sights on display are unimpressive, then you better hope that at least your soundtrack is memorable.",Tenet

The early trite visualization is just gimmicky. The tenet secret signal is used....once? In the end the SWAT teams are Deus ex Machina. The ""who"" of the good guys is not fully explained in original or purpose (or recruitment) and the motive of the bad guys is facile and trite (Cancer plot device? Really?).

2245,johndunne359,Should really be called Exposition!!,2,1 September 2020,"I'm a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this is the first review I've ever left on IMDB. Went in with the mindset that ""I didn't need to understand it but just feel it"" which I had seen in the title of a review.Didn't realise it was an actual line in the movie during the first 2 hours and 15 minutes of exposition.What can I say about this movie! Stiff performances but I don't blame the actors given the dialogue they had to work with.Protaganist: they are sending back bullets from the....Neil: ""future! Which means""Cat: ""the reverse entropy of the future will mean..... but what about my son""Protaganist: ""get me tickets to Tallinn, I need 15 trucks, a car that is fast but doesn't look fast and a jumbo jet""Neil: smirk and nod sagelyAs for the complexity I don't mind films that are hard to understand or are up for interpretation. The lighthouse was an excellent movie and made no sense upon the first watch but it was compelling with excellent performances, real atmosphere, beautiful imagery and brilliant use of sound. It was bewildering but intoxicating.Tenet has none of this, at one point the dialogue seemed to almost become similar to the satire of inception (film I love) that South Park did.Didn't care about the characters. Performances were stiff and Pattison was the only one with any charisma and I think a lot of that was due to relativity!!!Had none of the incredible tension of Dunkirk.

This one did not it was just a lot of what I would call torture sounds playing.

Good performances, particularly from Debicki although Nolan has regurgitated her character from The Night Manager.The storyline is utterly meaningless and deliberately exhausting. It's so baffling that by the time you get close to figuring a scene out you've missed the next - and that happens over and over again, which in the end left me not caring about any of it.You'll go home, read painfully written CliffsNotes, and realise it was all pointless anyway. You'll feel annoyed at yourself for reading up about it, longing for a non-existent deep and meaningful.

I can agree with most people that it's not as good as Interstellar or Inception, but in my eyes those are VERY hard to beat. That being said, this movie is close for me. I would like to say, I'm 17, and all of the people who are in their 30s and can't follow a plot to save their lives saying ""it's too confusing"" is ridiculous. Is this Nolan's most confusing film? For sure. But it's still not impossible to understand. Imagine you're watching two side by side videos of you walking across a field. One is played regularly and one is played in reverse. That is essentially the foundation of every scene in this movie, and they legit use this as an example at the very beginning of the movie. I can agree, the sound design is a little rocky, due to the fact it can be hard to hear dialog, but it's the same as Dunkirk. Watch the action and you'll figure out what's going on. The problem is people don't enjoy paying attention for the 2 and a half hour runtime. So, if you don't like movies that make you think and guess, don't go see this.

I'm a fan of Nolan and enjoy his work, but I think I'll file this under curio.
The cast? Well Kenneth Branagh hams it up as himself, but in angry mode while putting on an accent. Michael Caine plays just plays himself, without bothering with an accent.
For someone who's never watched ""Twilight"" I thought Robert Pattinson came across as the most likeable character.
The biggest disappointment was our Protagonist, John David Washington, with his cardboard cutout performance. An indestructible, humorless superman. Like James Bond but with literally no personality.

2257,nmrichardson,Christopher Nolan is the Protagonist of this operation,4,4 September 2020,"Tenet seems to take all the traits of the director and amplify them. The opening is even more frenetic than the excellent Joker heist scene at the beginning of The Dark Night, but it's less satisfying. The soundtrack out-Zimmers Zimmer with its racing, blaring, feverish relentlessness. Tenet's sound editing makes Bane from The Dark Knight Rises come across as an elocution teacher. I've skimmed literally hundreds of comments from viewers saying they couldn't catch the dialogue. Time-bending movies are notoriously difficult to weave together consistently, and this is no exception, though Nolan has worked really hard at it. So if you're going to make the plot super complex, why on earth would you make the dialogue unintelligible? That's just adding another completely unnecessary level of confusion for the audience.Then we come to the characters. Although there is some attempt to flesh out relationships between the Protagonist and the three other leads (Neil, Sator and Kat), there is an increasingly sterile quality to Nolan's work. I really cared about Leonard in Memento, was deeply concerned for Robert Angier in the Prestige and was rooting for Bruce Wayne for at least the first two Batman movies. Dom Cobb in Inception was supposedly relatable (a guy grieving his wife) but Nolan had already started to move into subordinating his more two-dimensional characters to his labyrinthine plots. The same thing applied with Cooper in Interstellar, though I did find the bookcase scene pretty poignant. It seems the more complex the plot, the more simplistic the characters. The fact that Nolan didn't even give Tenet's main character a name says it all. I suppose it's meant to add mystery, but really it just betrays the lack of development. It's really hard to invest in a guy when you don't know his back story, don't know his name, don't see his connections, don't really understand his motivations, and don't appreciate how he can summon large crews of elite soldiers to work for him. The Protagonist (John David Washington, channelling his dad from a better time travel movie, Deja Vu) is humanised slightly by his relationships with Robert Pattinson's angular Neil (the drinks scene, the goodbye scene with the Algorithm macguffin) and Elizabeth Debicki's somewhat wan Kat (you can see he is genuinely bothered about her). You also feel the equally-matched tension between him and Sator (Kenneth Branagh, hamming it up as usual, with a passable but still distracting Slavic accent). But the caring for Kat just seems tacked on to the Protagonist, because there is no romantic chemistry between them and you don't really see why he should be so motivated about this one woman he barely knows and her child who has the merest whisper of screen-time.Nolan writes his stuff without his brother Jonathan now, and the scripts are so plot-driven that there is little room for wit to sparkle or tension to build. There are some bus-ride exposition scenes that are just super-annoying as they might as well be to-the-camera lectures about sci-fi physics. The Protagonist makes the tired ""You haven't even bought me dinner"" joke when a flunky frisks him at Sator's dinner party. I kind of smirked just because I wanted to will the film into having a bit of fun or levity, but it takes itself way too seriously for that. You feel that John David Washington's energies have all been poured into running around forwards and then backwards, and he has been given so little space to exude panache or menace or pathos or humour or curiosity or fear.Another issue with Nolan is the perma-vanilla nature of the jeopardy. I really felt this in Inception, where faceless baddies shoot harmless bullets at the goodies and it's all so bland. It doesn't need to be Braveheart or Reservoir Dogs in terms of visceral threat and carnage, but as with so many superhero or thriller movies in the last decade, you don't ever really feel that anyone you care about is in any significant danger. Action scenes always seem like they are conducted in cold, clinical fight laboratories and they lack the grit and mess of some of the more crunchy hand-to-hand combats in Craig's Bond or Damon's Bourne. On a larger scale, the entire world is supposed to be under the impending threat of an extinction-level event when Sir Ken's FitBit trips out, but we feel almost nothing of this, despite the shockingly on-the-nose countdown clocks everywhere. A good film shouldn't make us feel so meh about the end of the world.I've focused more on character, dialogue and the feel of the movie, because so many others will be dissecting the mechanics of the plot, to infinity and back again. I just don't think it paid off. Yes, I think the time inversion trope kind of worked, but we shouldn't have to watch so many (admittedly brilliant) explanatory videos on YouTube to get a handle on them tricksy little backwards bullets (Heavy Spoilers makes a decent fist of stringing everything together in a digestible fashion).Tenet was cleverer than many other time-twisting movies, but much less fun and I couldn't connect with the human cyphers shoehorned into Christopher's Grand Design. So I'll finish with a list of other time-based movies and why they are all superior to Tenet:Deja Vu (starring the Protagonist Sr) is more exciting and interesting
Back to the Future is more fun and more engaging
Primer is more convincing and involving
Donnie Darko is more surreal and imaginative
Looper is more disturbing and edge-of-your-seat
Source Code is more agonising and fascinating
Bill & Ted's is funnier and goofier
Midnight in Paris is more musical and whimsical
Safety not Guaranteed is more indie and hokey
Groundhog Day is more entertaining and smile-inducing
Terminator 1 & 2 are more terrifying and adrenaline-pumping
Edge of Tomorrow is more Tom Cruisey and therefore more cheesy-gunghoSo watch any of those first, and then if you have another 7.5 hours free, watch Tenet (2.5 hours + 5 hours for all the YouTube explanatory videos!).",Tenet

But the cracks which were evident in his previous films are more pronounced here. The cracks in character depths and dialogues. It is almost like everything else is secondary to the concept. And high-concept films can surely be made with compelling characters. Ask Blade Runner, Primer or even Nolan's previous endeavours, which managed to not be completely soulless. But the central relationships in Tenet seem... robotic.I'm in awe of the concept and everything. And I'll need to revisit it to get a clearer picture.

This was the 1st time I saw a movie in a theatre in many months so I saw in a Dolby theater. This movie was very hard to understand right off the bat. I couldn't understand what any of the characters were saying for the majority of the run time and sometimes the characters would be inaudible at times because of the overpowering score. The score though was very good and creative. The action sequences were amazing as well especially the car chase and the inverted fight scene in the room.

Michael Caine looked embarrassed at having to deliver such awful dialogue (surely this ranks down there with Jaws 5 as one of his worst ever films).
Even the action set pieces were disappointing or just plain silly (bungee jumping up a skyscraper - really?).

The plot just doesn't make sense, the actors remain ill-defined. The sound is awful, it is quite hard to follow the dialogues even if English is your mothertongue.

The premise may seem to be generic, but Nolan's artistry ensures that the film leaves a unique impression.Many people have complained about lack of emotional connection to the characters. I would say that it did not bother me since it was clear that Nolan wanted to create a brainy escapist film. The movie does not have to say much about the human condition, but it is a solidly entertaining movie with great action, visuals and a story that keeps inviting you for more. I would love to see more movies like this. While I love the movies of Marvel, James Bond, John Wick, Mission Impossible etc., Nolan's movies have a complex plot, which sets them apart.John David Washington was an absolute badass in the role of the protagonist, and gave my favourite performance in the movie.The cinematography is great, and the film is best enjoyed on the biggest screen with alternating aspect ratios. The musical score by Ludwig Göransson is great too, and it was refreshing to see a Nolan film not scored by Zimmer.",Tenet

The characters were all borrowed from other movies. Emotions were nearly nonexistent, including times when at one point a mother says of her son, ""He's everything."" There is scant chemistry between anyone. The idea of this movie is brilliant but the movie itself is tedious and reliant on special effects and concepts to do its work. If you want characters and situations to care about at all, this is not a good movie for you. It's a mindless remake of 17 other films added to one really good idea.

You've seen before Inception, then you've seen Interstellar so you have EXPECTATIONS. No one told you that most probably this movie was made by a secret union between Marvel and Disney. Then you come home and read comments like ""you have to rewatch it""!!! Did you read that story when in the end a kid yell ""the king is naked""? That is the case, we are talking here about a B movie where they spent an A+++ budget.

The plot is hard to follow, but that was not my main complaint about this. The fact is that Nolan had so much writing to stuff into this movie that the 2h30 weren't nearly near enough to the time he needed. So, it ends up as an action and visual effects packed film that resembles a 007 wannabe and with the actores talking so fast that makes the movie appear to be running in fast forward. With that, we lose the sense of drama from the physics' explanation of the idea and also is almost impossible to consider whether the actors are any good or not. Just imagine if Star Wars 1, 2 and 3 had to be condensed in a 2h30 movie and i'm pretty sure they would never be such pop culture icons as they are. Nolan tries once more to present us with a head scratching movie idea (as he did in Inception or Interstellar), but the presentation is lousy, making it, in my opinion, a bad, bad movie.",Tenet

The surprise for me was Robert Pattinson who I wasn't a fan of but he played his character so well.I love how you can keep watching this an uncover more and more about the story that you didn't know in previous watchings.

And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well.

I could not understand what the characters were saying. How could this be possible with a high end Marantz surround sound system? I was relieved when other reviewers pointed out the same problem. Sounds like poor sound engineering or editing. . .I restarted the movie with subtitles and twenty minutes into the movie, it still made no sense. Of course, I should have known it would not make sense when Barbara, the scientist, warned me at the beginning with a line that seemed to break the fourth wall: ""Don't try to understand it.""Don't get me wrong. I like time travel movies and many have done a fairly good job of dealing with paradoxes of it all. Back to the Future, Donnie Darko, 12 Monkeys, to name a few. However, in this mess, Nolan took the lazy way out by having one of his characters proclaim, ""There is no answer. It's a paradox."" We're supposed to be fooled by this lazy plot-saving device into thinking we're hearing something profound about time travel. ""Oh, Nolan said 'there is no answer,' what a genius, he is!""And all the time inverting could not hide the action movie clichés that abound here. We got your basic evil jealous plutonium-grubbing Russian oligarch on a yacht guarded by balding tattooed Russian gangsters, the hero in the kitchen restaurant fighting a whole gang of them off without so much a wrinkle in his bespoke three-piece suit, and the impenetrable multi-layered vault being easily hacked. Apparently, in this super vault, no one thought of putting in video monitoring. . .The cinematic idea of so-called time inversion by reversing the film is unconvincing and again, sheer intellectual laziness.Don't be fooled by the Nolan fan-boys who says this is a movie with mind-blowing concepts. I think they're all experiencing reaction formation.I'm hoping my future self will come from the future and advise me not to waste two hours of my life watching this.

What a waste of money and time.,4,24 December 2020,"After sitting through the plodding, convoluted, incomprehensible plot of Tenet, the only thing I got from this is why Warner Bros. Pictures is still handing over fat bank rolls to Christopher Nolan.No emotional depth, no logic to when an object or person starts going inverted and why other times they don't. It's like #Inception, only you can't follow the story at all and don't really care when it's over. Both are filled with his trademark handicap of stilted, overstuffed exposition, but at least Inception had some thrilling set pieces and was a story you could follow. Tenet's exposition made no sense and the visual example of the movie rules only further muddled the audience's understanding of the subject matter.The ""this guy is fighting backwards"" and ""these bullets are returning to the gun"" gets real old real fast. It's a flash in the pan idea that holds no weight or lasting resonance.Kudos to the actors who did as good of a job as they could given the material.

This movie will be analysed and watched for years to come. Its so incredibly complex, yet Nolan makes it a fairly easy watch with his incredible cinematography.

The main characters (except Dubicki) are bland, the main villain and his motives are completely unbelievable and stupid.
The first half of the movie is just bombarding the audience with mumbled exposition, but good luck hearing it because this film has the worst sound mixing I've ever experienced. I've heard this complaint with other Nolan films and I never noticed it. In Tenet it is blaring.

If the premise had varied a bit here and there, you could even let the story go through as a very fresh idea for a James Bond movie. For a Nolan film, it seems a bit strange.

It is a both bold and ambitious behemoth of a movie, with a story so complicated you can not afford ro miss a step. I have only seen it once, but I am sure this is the kind of movie that gets even better the second time.

Ten years down the line this will be talked about like it deserves, but Tenet (2020) is in it for the long game, have no doubt. It's a film that taps into Christopher Nolan's main focus in all of his films, in perhaps the least metaphorical way yet - TIME - whilst before he could only mess with time in his films in the editing room, now Nolan has been given a chance to alter time in a way that allows his characters to actually perceive it just like the audience unlike Memento (2000) or The Prestige (2006.) I'm sure he had fun with that. As will any audience member, even ones that don't love the plot or the characters must appreciate the spectacle of this film and the work that went into it. Simply breathtaking.The 'inversion' plot item is original and a breath of fresh air for any genre but especially something like the spy/espionage genre which Nolan really has a go with. Washington and Pattinson are great in the lead performances and have great chemistry. At first it may seem like they are bland characters but in truth in the end (No Spoilers) their relationship and the deep humanity of the characters on screen is revealed, it is clear their original blank canvas personalities were on purpose and their development, for the first time in film history works backwards, and in context with the backwards run of the inversion technology in mind, this could genuinely be perceived as genius writing from Nolan.

I don't want to spoil the story. So lets just say; It will give you plenty to talk/debate about and you really need to pay attention to details if you want to get this movie on the first viewing. A little warning: Compared to Inception its a lot less linear and harder to follow.The fast paced action and the great acting form all the main characters (Even from Robert Pattinson, who came a long way since that vampire disaster) made this a very enjoyable movie. The only downside was that the movie is a bit too long and because of this and the 'reverse time thing' the second halve had more trouble keeping my attention than the first. Additionally the final battle had way too much going on, even a movie nerd like me couldn't keep up with everything. (Although that does give me a reason to watch it again... :)The science of this new idea also has quite a few issues, even if you accept this unexplained technology, the movie only seems to follow its own rules to the level that it helps the story. Personally I think its important that a Science fiction movie follows its own rules, but I guess such a complex issue like this allows for a few short cuts and paradoxes. At least, the timeline does make sense and if you pay attention there are plenty off hints that will let you figure things out before the big reveal.

A magical film whose action sequences service character and plot rather than servicing spectacle.Nolan seems best when plots are mostly provided in advance for him, like Batman Begins.

2350,barrys-2,Watch At Your Own Peril,1,27 December 2020,"""Tenet"" is neither complicated nor clever. It's an implausible action/espionage story with ridiculous time travel nonsense thrown in. It's sort of a very bad combination of the ""Mission Impossible"" films, the ""Terminator"" films, and ""12 Monkeys."" The characters are trite, and, in some cases, the actors are poorly cast for roles; I can't imagine any audience member actually caring about any of these cardboard cutouts. The script is often laughable in its attempt to be mysterious, exciting, and deep, none of which it achieves. Much of the dialogue, in trying to be impressive, is actually comical. While it has a lot of action scenes, they are often drawn out and tedious. And the idea of reversing the film to demonstrate reversing time is a cliché as old as film itself. The music is truly abominable, imitating old simple-minded analog electronic shtick from the 1970s or, mixing electronics and instrumental samples, pounding out a few crass themes over and over until you almost want to scream. And when I say pounding, I mean it, as the volume of the music and sound design are insufferably loud, sometimes drowning out the dialog.. Maybe the ear-shattering levels at which old rockers used to play as they went deaf influenced Nolan's preferences for final soundtrack mixes. Perhaps worst of all, the film is terribly bloated: an hour could have been cut from this film without giving up anything central to the paltry plot, and it still would have been too long. At 150 minutes, the film seems interminable. All of these problems lie at Nolan's feet, and he, alone, is responsible for this mess. While a lot of people seem to like this film, I know that many are impressed by quantity over quality, and allow themselves to be mesmerized by fast-paced action and cutting, all of which are derivative and lack any cinematic interest. It's the kitchen sink approach.In my opinion, Nolan has done four good films: ""Following,"" ""Momento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception."" It seems that the more money he gets to make a film, the worse it is. I don't think I'll bother to see any of his work in the future. I do think whatever talent he had earlier in his career has dissipated in direct inverse proportion to the budgets of the films he writes and directs. Perhaps he could access reversed entropy to improve his future work.",Tenet

It's got most Bond films got: the plot intertwines various countries, a luxurious lifestyle with grand scenery and visceral action sequences. It doesn't have the series trademark sensuality, though.His unique twist is, like most Nolan pictures, the manipulation of time. Unlike Dunkirk it doesn't have various timeframes, but twisting time and having fun with it is a big pry of Tenet. Just as most Nolan films it is a bit too confusing with a single seating, especially for children. Unfortuately this picture, probably because of the 150-minute runtime limit, is all information with little breathing room.Although this film has little depiction of sensibility, its depiction of violence is pretty intense. There are some suggestive moments of torture. Trigger warning for a portrayal of domestic violence.Despite the MPAA rating not having strong language, there is one F-bomb in an emotionally intense scene.

2363,jubingautam,Nolantastic !!,9,14 December 2020,"Glad to have resumed movie theatre break with Tenet. Nolan is a super human. Conceptually the movie is both unique and mind boggling.

2364,markjenkinsmedia,NOT QUITE AS STUPID AS INCEPTION OR INTERSTELLAR,4,30 November 2020,"""Tenet"" is not quite as stupid as ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", the stupidest movie of all time, though it is fairly stupid, but doesn't ram its own stupidity in your face quite as much as those earlier titles. (SPOILERS) The movie's basic tenet (ha-ha) is that it's possible to encounter objects moving backwards in time, or with negative entropy. But this idea becomes quite complex and it's not clear that even Nolan who wrote and directed, is keeping track of it properly.Variations on the reversed time theme are added throughout the film, but some of them might need a bit more thought. It's not clear to me that two men can have a fight when one is punching and the other is un-punching. Or why a reversed time bullet is said to do more damage than a normal one. Or that encountering a reversed time car is the same as driving a normal time car backwards.All would be clearer if not for Nolan's current interest in men with beards. The charisma-free lead mumbles into his beard most of the time. In case he doesn't have sufficient impact, there's a second almost identical looking character with a second mumbly beard. Funnily enough these don't look like real beards, but like the fuzzy foam type stuck onto an Action Man (or GI Joe) figure. Ken Branagh, doing the Russian accent which seems to be his speciality (why?) also has a beard to mumble into. The female lead doesn't have a beard, but manages to mumble into something - the soundtrack often obscures the dialogue anyway.Also Nolan seems to be working his way through a book called ""great movie cliches"". There's loads of stuff in the movie that you've seen before - having a choice of army patches and sticking one on your shoulder only after you see which army squad arrives (pinched from ""Money Heist"", I think), pulling a man's gun apart while he holds it, walking too close to the baddie so he can snatch your gun out of your hand, saying ""See you on the other side"" (from Da Vinci's Demons"", ""Dark"" etc etc etc).But Nolan thinks he has been particularly clever in hiding an acrostic in the names of the baddie, his company, and various passwords. OK, it's ""SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS"", thank you very much. Arrange it in a square, it read the same backwards and forward, up and down. It also contains the term ""PATER NOSTER"". Why? No-one knows, or cares.The soppy aim for a child-friendly rating (pointless - no child will enjoy this film) means that blows are struck but never seen landing. As in ""Inception"", the action scenes are actually good if you don't think too much about what's happening. But by the time you reach them towards the end of the movie, you've lost interest. The central character inhabits a charisma-free zone, the eventual introduction of the time reversing machine is hidden away, the actual threat to humanity posed by mumbly Ken Branagh is pretty unclear.The movie's too long, and there's a lot of wordy sections. But switch off your brain and it's OK, and not a load of fles tnegludni parc at all.",Tenet
2365,errorinpersona,"Made to be complicated, not good",4,28 August 2021,"As a huge Nolan fan, I am very disappointed by this movie.You can feel that the goal of this film was simply to put the typical ""Nolan time games"" to the next level, make the film complicated.

Great movie for cinema. Locations, sound are perfect. Direction and acting very good i realy liked Washington perfomance. Sometimes i felt i need pause button on cinema cause everything happens so fast. Some say its too complicated but its clasic Nolan. If you liked Memento and Inception you Will like this one too.
IDEA FOR NEW MOVIE : Mix Inception, Tenet and Memento. Agents go in Dreams, Travel the time and film is going backwards 🤣🤣🤣

You will surely enjoy this action-packed thriller with a time travel twist, but the time travel here (not being conventional and also not being exactly time travel) is the part which becomes sort of a weak point. The movie is filled with thrilling and unique action scenes which you may never have experienced. The reasons for the movie not being Nolan's best work are the fast pacing (due to which the time travelling part is more confusing), lack of emotional attachment to the protagonist and not so high stakes. The movie desperately tries to make you feel and care about the protagonist and the world he's saving, but the stakes just don't feel that much important (again the main reason for that is the fast pace). I hope we get to see the extended version with more fleshed out characters a mediocre pace.",Tenet

Yes there is a Bond and yes there is a Bond villain and yes there is a Bond girl and yes there are Bond locations. Theres even a Felix Leiter and the usual carvery that enter into most bond movies.Time itself is the bomb of mass destruction for this madman, oh and everybody in the future who doesn't like us destroying there eco systems.It's all there you just have to piece it together. It took one take for me. But I imagine it will take a few watches for a lot of people. Suggest you watch the first few bond movies and Nolan's other movies , it will help.Oh another thing,there's absolutely no problem with sound and dialogue watching on a TV and a good surround system.

The characters are VERY poor with no development whatsoever. The ""villain"" is one of the worst characters I have ever seen, very poorly driven in his evilness; which make him a very old kind of character (being evil for the sake of evil itself, with no other context that explains that will to destroy the world).
The plot is unintelligible, with a mix of danger-friendship-love and very questionable physics that has no good fit between itself.

The score is intrusive, at times, and you cannot understand half the dialogue. It will require another view with subtitles.That all said, it's a fun film full of twists, and while it's confusing, I think a second viewing will glean some insights. It's almost like two films in one.",Tenet
2390,jsmiths-22735,Not as clever as it thinks it is.,5,13 December 2020,"The plot, while confusing is actually straight forward, 2nd watch that is. Therein lies the problem.. I shouldn't, or anyone really, have to watch a 2 hour and 30 minute film twice to get the full picture. Nolan is very talented and very intelligent, especially his knowledge of the sciences. But, this film shows his ambition has lead him down an unnecessary road, confusion filmmaking.He's better suited to turning the implausible into reality and immersing the viewer fully in his vision. His attempt at redefining time travel movies has failed to actually interest anyone that was remotely interested in it. The biggest mistake is the lack of explanation of how this theory is possible (not just its origins). This leads to the film just honestly feeling silly to watch and not very interesting.As other viewers and critics alike have mentioned the sound, I feel I should address this. The score isn't awful, but it's not great and it's extraordinarily loud and dramatic when it shouldn't be. Maybe we've been spoiled by other Nolan films that have been graced by Hans Zimmer, this one is too loud. This destroys dialogue at times and I seriously struggled, especially with Robert Pattinson, to hear what the actors were mumbling. Taking into consideration that Nolan films rely heavily on his written word, they may want to address this. However, considering I watched this via Blu-Ray.. they clearly didn't.The acting was good, except for Washington. I feel his performance started strong and just levelled out into a down right average B-rate affair. As I said, acting was good.. just don't expect Oscar worthy performances from the rest. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, despite a short part, was the standout for me.It's visually stunning, but as I've said.. Nolan was far too ambitious and it really hasn't paid off for him. I don't wish to spend 5 hours watching a film just to understand it. But, once you do understand it you realise just how simple the premise is, but it's been overly complicated by an otherwise direct, intelligent & talented director, Christopher Nolan.He really needs to stop relying on the dramatic scores.. it didn't save him this time and it won't save him anymore. He is a genius and a genius filmmaker, but I don't want a genius script that confuses the life out of me, I want a great script that engages me.It's in no way a bad film, but, it isn't great either.",Tenet

The movie does not make up for a popcorn flick which explains a lot of bad reviews. But a second run at it with subtitles and a hellofalot attention, this movie is heaven for any sci-fi lover. I could draw some parallel with Dan Brown's Inferno and if you've read the book, you'll know what I am speaking of. The only bad thing about this movie was David Washington, a product of nepotism.

2392,kevinlawsonaz,Nolan's Masterpiece; But only after several viewings! (SPOILERS),10,4 October 2020,"I believe Nolan is playing a Very Long and Specific game with Tenet. I have now seen it 4 times, (once in IMAX, Absolutely Worth It BTW). I degress..... The fact that the ""Main"" character (John D. Washington) is Never given a name, (aside from) ""The Protagonist"" is/was intentional but not for the obvious reasons.... but because he is Not the ""Main"" character (storywise), it is Neil. Neil is Not only the (spoiler) Son of Elizabeth Debicki's character, Kat and Kenneth Branaugh's, Sator, but most importantly lifelong friend, Ally and in many ways, Gaurdian Angel to ""The Protagonist"". He is the ""Key"" to understanding the timeline, the stakes and the importance of the narrative purpose of ""Inversion"" & the entire reason we are meant to care about any of them
and their journey in the 1st place.The ending sequence/3rd act (when truly understood) by paying the necessary attention to (in Uber detail) helps to explain and allow you to understand the reality of how Our perception of time and our emotional response based on it (within this story) are relative at best, at least until we settle in and attempt to completely comprehend the implications of the 'Grandfather Paradox'... As this component of the story is Extremely important within the films storyline, between The Protagonist, Sator and Neil and Time itself. Pay close attention to how many times/iterations and the effects Neil being inverted within the sequence in the underground cave have on your understanding of who/where and when Neil is within TENET.I LOVE Hans Zimmer and was initially upset he wasn't scoring this Nolan film... but L.V.G shines and creates a perfect balance of intensity, emotion, scope and harmony with Not only the visuals but with the entire idea of how Time and Posterity (as mentioned by the Protagonist) come together for an all emcompassing experience!If Nolan ever had a film thag will release and extended ""Director's Cut"".... it will be TENET. The 2.5 hour runtime (although slower in the beginning) once it picks up is the epidamy of a Artistic and Visually exceptional Palindrome!!!I will say this is Not a film to see once and understand it entirely, as with most Nolan films, but in my opinion, but with very viewing it becomes deeper more dimensionally layered nuances create a Puzzle unfolding in equal ways delightfully unexpected and rewarding!Undeniably a film that should be seen at least once on the Silver Screen...

The only thing that could turn people off is that this movie is a mind f*ck. The first half I understood around 90%...but it went to 60% in the last half. The fun lies in connecting the pieces of the puzzle in your head to slowly get that percentage up. This is not a sit back and relax type movie. However, even though the puzzle aspect is fun, it is sometimes downright frustrating. The last act I was just left frustrated because my brain was left doing mental gymnastics. This is because the movie sometimes does not give you enough information to know very important things to the plot.

But while the film boasts some very interesting concepts, it suffers from some glaring issues.The single biggest problem that I found was with the sound mixing, which is really quite dreadful. The score and sound effects dominate, leaving most of the dialogue fairly muffled. This has been an issue in some of Christopher Nolan's other films (one could blame the noisy IMAX cameras he likes to use, but I suspect the problem arises from post-production), but since the premise and plot of Tenet is particularly complicated, this puts the viewer at an immediate disadvantage unless they have subtitles on.The other major problem is that the film isn't particularly engaging on an emotional level; the actors work their best with the material, but outside of a few quips the characters are flat. Again, dialogue and characterisation are not Nolan's strong suit either, but compare this film to Interstellar, which was equally high-stakes and equally dodgy in the character department, and yet was still emotionally riveting. For reasons that I can't tangibly describe, that emotional weight simply isn't there in Tenet and as a consequence it's a bit of a hard sell.That being said, the concept of inverted entropy is consistent and more or less makes sense, as long as you're willing to overlook a few dubious points. The production values are also excellent; it's clear that if nothing else Nolan still has an excellent eye for technical detail.This is worth a watch for the overall concept, but it's definitely one of Nolan's weaker films.",Tenet

2412,HarryScuderia,Confusing Movie but Incredibly Thrilling,8,23 December 2020,"Tenet is not a perfect movie but a movie I like a lot. Its concepts of Time Inversion and Time Loops are very interesting and fun to experience first hand.John David Washington's mysterious Protagonist is an interesting character whose mystery doesn't hinder the movie. He does a fantastic job here. Robert Pattinson does a great job and I'm so glad to see him in big movies again (cannot wait to see him as Batman). Tenet has issues with exposition, something that can get a little distracting for some people. Tenet's time travel/inversion rules can confusing and it's best to read up about it after seeing the movie to understand it better.Like with Nolan's other movies, Tenet is a canvas for fantastic action. The opening Opera House scene, the highway Scene and the fight scene are all thrilling to watch. Combined inverted elements, it's one of Nolan's best films for action.Tenet is not Nolan's best and has several flaws, though it has quickly grown to be my favourite movie of 2020 and one of my personal favourites. The time inversion is an interesting concept and is probably Nolan's most unique concept in all of his movies. A good movie that is worth the watch.",Tenet

2414,exiledreplicant,A Great Puzzler's Dive,7,17 January 2021,"Those who know me know that I am an enigmatology enthusiast. That is, the study of puzzles. I could write an entire review on the use of the word ""TENET"" for the movie title alone, as the word itself comes with deep meaning in history and in puzzle craft...and I might! Christopher Nolan is of puzzle-mind, has been from his first features, and has carried that love with him through every one of his films. I like Nolan's work a lot because it tickles me in my enigmatism (word coined here).Nolan uses the famed Sator Square as inspiration for names used throughout the film. Judging the content of the film, I am also guessing he used the Sator Square as a blueprint for the entire plot of the film. A brief explanation of the Sator Square can help with the theme of the movie, even if you don't want (and don't need) to understand the intricate logistics of this film's version of time travel.The Sator Square is a five-word Latin palindrome, meaning the same backward and forwards. The five words are: SATOR (the name of our main villain), AREPO (the name of an enigmatic art forger), TENET (a password for access to people who know about the inverted objects, and possible name of a secret organization), OPERA (the opening extraction scene by the CIA), and ROTAS (the name of the security company at the Oslo Freeport). The earliest example of the Sator Square comes from the ruins of Pompeii (a location mentioned in the film, and partly taking place nearby in the Amalfi Coast) but has also been unearthed in Rome, England, and Syria to name a few. This square will read the same top-bottom, bottom-top, L-R, R-L. It can also be rotated 180 degrees and still be read in those same ways. The Square's symmetry group is the Klein four-group, which is a group with four elements, in which each element is self-inverse, meaning that the function is its own inverse. One of the photos I'm adding is of the Sator Square so you can see for yourself and see what I mean, why I said it, and how it relates to the film.In the movie, the ""Protagonist"" (John David Washington) is a CIA agent that gets caught and tortured during an extraction operation at an opera house. Instead of giving up information to the enemy, he takes a cyanide pill. He doesn't die, and instead wakes on a boat and discovers he has passed a 'test' by taking the pill instead and is now recruited by a secret organization called Tenet. We are pushed through the opening scenes and storyline too quickly in the first ten minutes. It seemed like a race to get to the fun action stuff. I wish they spent a little more time here in the beginning while giving us all this exposition, as understanding what the hell is going to be happening for the next 120 minutes leans greatly on the idea that the watcher can grasp as least a little bit what they are about to be seeing. As we all know, Nolan loves to have loud music, loud sound effects, and almost muted voices amongst all of it. The first twenty minutes are no different for him. I think he must have gotten made fun of so much for it by now that he just does it to mess with us. Hats off for not giving up but his movies now forever will require subtitles so you can hear the very important lines that are being said, even though he clearly doesn't want you to hear them. So, the first ten minutes are like listening to Bane if he was a scientist trying to explain string theory to the hearing impaired.What we and the Protagonist discover is that there are objects in the world that have inverted entropy and move backward through time! Cool idea, impossible to truly understand as a casual watcher. If you are a casual watcher, don't think too hard about all the action and reverse time travel. It's not worth the headache. Just know that some things move backward in time. To us, the people moving forward through time, it will look like these objects are moving backward, when in fact, they are moving forwards into the past with inverse energy. To them, it looks like we are all moving backward. This creates some very fun things visually in the film.
This idea and the visuals he uses to represent it are where Christopher Nolan truly shines as a filmmaker. This story could not be told in any other medium except cinema. It is an idea that can only be carried through by showing the viewer in moving visuals and sound. He is telling a truly individual and original story made to be told through the art of filmmaking. It's beautiful and loud and visually stunning. The sequences of backward motion vs. forward motion are shown in an interesting way and a way that is purely Nolan. It will remind you a lot of ""Inception"", especially the hallway fight scene. It's clear he meant to do this, as the rest of the film's color, cinematography, and sound mimic many of the ideas from that movie. A spiritual universe cousin, maybe.We find out that people or a group of people in the future have created machines that can make this inverse matter, or matter with inverted entropy, and send it back to the past, presumably with the idea to change things. We learn that they messed up somewhere along the way. The future is somehow dim and without more future. Why they decide to come back to the past to ""murder the world"" is never really made clear, but also, we don't really care, do we? Bad people doing bad things for reasons no one will ever know. It's not that pertinent to the story being told. Just know that they are trying to go back in time and kill their own grandfathers. The big problem is that if too much inverse matter ends up in the past (where we live) and the inverse matter being sent back ends up having more mass in the world than the straightforward matter we have all come to know and love, the world dies. Poof. Boom. Whimper? We're not sure how, but clearly no good.
When something enters these machines, they come out the other side as inverse. This means people, too, so when our Protagonist comes out the other side, he needs to learn backward gravity, inverse motion, and opposite thermodynamics. He can't inhale the air because the air refuses to bond to the sacs in your lungs that are breathing backward compared to the rest of the world. The idea of traveling back in time has an interesting idea (and makes the most sense when it comes to logical time travel. That idea is that if you want to travel back in time, you move backward at the same speed as moving forward. So, if you want to go back a day, it takes a day to go back. If you want to go back ten days, it takes ten moving backward. Once you go through the inverse matter machine, your clock starts, and you move backward as long as you are out on that other side. You must go back to that machine or another machine in the world to get turned back forward, or you will continue going back forever. And you can't breathe the air...sooo, that's gonna be a problem.Some parts of it are really well thought out and other parts are glossed over...and that's fine. Our brains are still trying to figure out if he picked up the bullet or the bullet jumped into his hand...If he never put his hand over the bullet would it have ever known that it was once dropped out of his hand to know that it could jump back into his hand at the right time? Yeah...that stuff. Don't sit with the specifics too long. Just enjoy the ride there.And that's the plot! There's some stuff in there with a girl and a bad guy that is helping bring the matter from the future to the past. He has a generic bad guy quality about him and a convenient bout of suicide fancy, so he wants to die and take the whole world with him (including his wife and son). Take out the inverse matter and time travel, and it seems like a straightforward Bond film. It's got the hot girl that changes sides, the spy protagonist who fights better than he dresses and knows how to get what he wants. It's fun. The action sequences are astounding and look practical instead of CGI messes. I thought the overall production quality of the locations was not that exciting. The buildings didn't stand out, the rooms weren't dressed very well. He didn't use much in the way of thematic color palettes or bold choices when it came to fabrics or walls. It probably would have been too distracting or blurry with how fast the movie ran through each spot.Okay, back to the square now that you know the themes and mechanics of time travel. My favorite part of the movie. He took the idea of the Sator Square, a palindrome of names that goes forward, backward, 180, and inverse. He took that idea of words and turned it into a 3-D world. What happens if you take TIME and make it into a Sator Square palindrome. At the end of the film you see a very cool war scene with two teams, a red team, and a blue time, like laser tag. This felt so much like a little boy getting to make a laser tag war movie it made me giggle, but off-topic. The two teams split up and do what they call a ""temporal pincer movement"", where non-inverted red team troops and inverted blue team troops make a simultaneous attack. This is mind-boggling, as the inverted team is doing everything backward. That means the red team is going into the war dodging bullets and running away from falling buildings from the aftermath of what the inverted blue team has already done. Walls are unexploding and trapping people behind the walls, buildings are un-collapsing just to be shot and blown up at a different place by the red team. It's all very cool, but also is a great way to show the idea of the Sator Square if it existed in time at coinciding moments. What would happen if you could read every angle of the Sator Square in 3-D space at the same time, be able to see every side of a cube at one single moment in time...what does that do to time, or to us the knower? The idea of the Sator Square made physical in 3-D space is a puzzler's dream and nightmare.",Tenet

2425,rodunited25,Rollercoaster Masterpiece,9,3 May 2021,"I believe that Tenet is Christopher Nolan's lowest rated film because people refuse to take the time to understand the story. It is a very complicated story, but once you start to understand it, it's brilliant. I watched Tenet two nights ago for the first time and I had absolutely no idea what I had just watched when the end credits started to roll. The next day, yesterday, I did several things to help myself better understand what I had just watched the night before. The first thing I did was I listened to the ""Tenet"" podcast from Raiders of the Lost Podcast. Raiders of the Lost Podcast is a film and TV podcast hosted by twins James and Anthony Deveney; they take the time to summarize, review, and grant additional information on films and television shows. I have listened to the majority of their podcasts and I would highly recommend listening to them. After I listened to their podcast on ""Tenet,"" I can confidently say that I gained a way better understanding of the movie. Another thing I did was I read an article that summarized the movie, analyzed the science and history behind it, and explained the ending. Then after, listening to the podcast and reading the article, I watched the movie a second time. I was able to follow along a lot better, and understand the significance of certain scenes. Because I took the time to understand the story, I realized how incredible it truly is; it is definitely mind-bending but it is comprehensible. On top of that, the visual effects are beautiful, the stunts are insane, and the acting is 10/10. If you don't take the time to fully understand Tenet, you will not get the chance to give it the appreciation it deserves.",Tenet

These types of movies get better with every rewatch, pulling you deeper into the philosophical rabbit hole that the movie centers its concepts on.

For viewers that enjoy the more straightforward plots to watch in one sitting (Batman triology, Interstellar, etc.), this title is probably not for them.",Tenet

2431,ryan-clements-1,Tenet 100% Spoiler Free Review,7,23 August 2020,"So just got back from seeing Tenet and thought I'd lay down some thoughts. Fear not, as I promise you this will soil nothing of the plot. Quite frankly, I wouldn't even know where to begin, since this is one film that is a bona fide assault on the mind.For those planning (or able) to see it soon, all I can say is bring your A-game, as this film is hard work. The plot is extremely convoluted, focused around a Nolanised concept called 'time inversion' (which is briefly and, dare I say, ineffectively explained at the beginning), told via an onslaught of rapid-fire dialogue and exposition for nearly all of it's 150-minute runtime. It makes Inception seem like Sesame Street by comparison, and it strongly reminded me of Primer, which I always considered one of the most difficult films to follow... until now.The pacing is relentless, rarely slowing down enough for the audience to digest the cavalcade of information thrown at them. Adding to the confusion is the sound mix, which often makes dialogue very difficult to hear and ultimately obscures vital information for the audience.By the end of the film, I was left with an idea of the overall plot, but feel it's going to take many revisits to fully understand the details, which are kinda crucial in really understanding what's going on. I trust Nolan has a firm grasp on the logistics of his story, but without an all access pass to the depths of his imagination, it's a hard task to firm grasp on the concept.I can't even really rate this movie (the review rating is more if a rating-in-progress)... I know somewhere in the future I adore this film, but for now I'm as lost as the protagonist was for at least the first hour.",Tenet

But....the story is way too convoluted. It's really hard to follow along with the story with so much going on and reverse with normal direction characters. Don't want to add spoilers so I won't go into details but it's really difficult to follow the plot. Add to that the difficulty in understanding what the actors are saying due to all the noise means you have to use close caption subtitles.Best way to sum this up is it is Inception if they made it 10x harder to understand what's going on.,Tenet
2434,mvkumar01,Brilliant - Take a bow Nolan for pushing the boundaries of imagination.,10,19 April 2021,"This movie is brilliant. It is simply amazing. I never could imagine how could Nolan come up with such ideas. I can't even fathom. For how complex it is, it is worth understanding for its brilliance. Mind blowing. I am glad Nolan doesn't underestimate the audience. Some may feel this is worst of Nolan. Oh no. It is one of his best. His most genius idea after inception.A basic understanding of a concept is required. Which is this - why doesn't a broken egg re attach? Because any system gradually declines in to disorder - disorderness is measured by entropy. For a naturally occuring process entropy always increases with time. Universe always moves to higher entropy naturally. Broken egg has higher entropy than unbroken one.That is why with time, things decay. Ageing ,wear & tear. If you can reverse entropy you can re attach broken egg as if it was never broken. Make water flow upwards.So in the movie when entropy can be reversed, it means you can travel back in time. The turnstiles reverse your entropy and then you can begin to travel back in time. Let us say you entered turnstile - you begin to travel back in time - for you it seems the world as a video is playing in reverse mode. For the world you are moving in weird reverse mode. Then if you enter turnstile again - you will start to move forward in time but in the past.Watch the movie with above understanding. Hope it helps.",Tenet
2435,ebyandsmartie,A dull story cleverly made,4,4 September 2020,"A dull story cleverly made that has more holes that a tea-bag!John David Washington play his character way too aloof, too cool for school or just rudely odd. Nolan has written the Protagonist as uncharismatic in a spy thriller that replies so much on the time element it totally forgets to make the characters two dimensional.I understand the time/inversion element, but it never explains how the 9 parts of the algorithm were placed in the past? In this film to travel into the past you have to physically do the travelling yourself but you need oxygen to keep you alive, so...
1. How do you travel years, decades or centuries into the past to hide the parts of the algorithm without oxygen? And people noticing a person going backwards? I know some will say the parts of the algorithm were inverted, then buried so they keep travelling back in time. But that would mean if you invert an object it will continue backwards in time indefinitely, which means all the guns and bullets inverted would, eventually, be found in ancient history?At some point, again never explained, Kenneth Branagh's character builds the inversion machines, so...
2. How did he build it with the present day technology? Yes I know he was sent the plans, but you could send the plans on how to build a mobile-phone to your great great great grandfather and they would mean nothing to him and even if he did understand the concept he still couldn't built one in 1871!!!
3 Which means if you travel backward 'inverted' past the point the first inversion machine/booth was ever built how the hell do you invert back into normal time. Will enough canisters of oxygen you could travel years, but without the inversion booth you can't move back into normal time.4. The film never explain eating or getting old during being inverted. Do you age?
5. Go watch Red Dwarf Season 3 Episode 1 'Backwards' to see what happens if you need to go to the toilet while travelling backwards in time!6. if you keep going forwards and backwards there will be multiple versions of yourself. 20 trips 20 versions. I know it says in the film you can't touch a version of yourself as this would be catastrophic, but the main character has a fight with himself!!! And he was bleeding!7. Why has no one travelled back to tell themselves about all the events, which they could then avoid from ever happening, like the inverted phone he gave Kat, which she uses to call him to stop her being assassinated. They prove they can change time/history so just go way back to before the film events start and end it then!8. Why was Priya trying to assassinate Kat anyway? What was the point?9. Was it just me or was Aaron Taylor-Johnson just playing a part that looked and sounded like it was written for Tom Hardy?

2441,sammytinatree,Not as smart as it thinks it is,5,20 September 2020,"Tenet falls into this strange category where it both fails to commit to its time travel mechanic while also being hamstrung by those same ideals. The premise (people/things can be swapped to travel into the future/into the past) is somewhat unceremoniously introduced early in the film and then promptly forgotten for 30 minutes as the first act meaders into setting up future time travelling plot point. Because of this, the first half pacing is fairly shot through - characters shift haphazardly from goal to goal, people introduced and immediately forgotten, dialogue exposition-heavy and crammed into every corner. Add to that Nolan's (now somewhat ubiquitous) overly loud sound mixes and it's a fairly disorienting first 90 minutes that's difficult to decipher.The haphazard setup of the first half therefore seems determined to prepare a massive palindrome-esque third act that somehow fails to materialise. There are some clever effects and fight scenes yes, but they seem somewhat lacklustre in the face of the damage done to the first act trying to incorporate them. It almost seems like Nolan expects us to blow our load over the reverse effect even though it's been on youtube for years. Bits a pieces of buildings falling up/cars flipping back over, but nothing groundbreaking goes on here that can't be basically achieved with a handheld camera and basic video editing software.To be clear, this isn't the worst film ever; there are rewarding emotional moments plus good acting by Robert Pattinson throughout. These are not enough however to salvage the film from its particularly baffling first half. Worse film ever? No, though it could quite possibly be the worse Nolan film so far.",Tenet
2442,ithehappy,Psychology is just as much science as Physics,6,17 January 2021,"At the outset I would to like to note that Nolan is my favourite director/ film maker. Yes, there are many legendary directors we have had over generations but it is Christopher Nolan who just redefined how a movie should be 'presented' to the audience. Hans Zimmer's music direction for his movies was (is) legendary. How many times before Nolan we bothered to listen to movie OSTs? I can't recall many times, if any. The end package that Nolan creates is extraordinary and for viewers like me who like to be thrilled after (and during) a movie remain ever so happy and thankful for that.Now coming to this movie, as you can see my rating is only 60%, because IMHO that's what this movie should be given. It's NOT a masterpiece like Inception was. It is not Memento. It is not Interstellar. The basis of the movie is time inversion and the physics behind it is fine and maybe acceptable in a world where Turnstile (or a machine/ tech. alike) already exists but there is indeed a tremendous problem of exposition in this film, which leaves the audience confused and unhappy. While the attention to detail is impeccable (seriously the more you watch it more surprising it gets in terms of detailing), the fast camera shifts especially at critical junctures was disappointing.I won't go into the physics of it as I only have a basic idea of the subject but this is a Science Fiction after all and the Fiction part shows. 'What's happened's happened'- fine. But one must remember human beings are not programmed creatures, at least not yet, therefore the underlying concept that the present version of you are going to do things exactly as it happened as by your past version doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I am wrong, but doesn't feel like it. This is the reason why I can't call this movie a Nolan great, let alone a masterpiece.I enjoyed the acting of Pattinson (he was really extraordinary), Branagh, Debicki and few others, Washington's performance may have left something to desire, but eh it was fine. The background music was absolutely fantastic, yes, at times too loud but the different tracks based on the on-screen scenes synced almost perfectly.While this film remains the one I have watched most number of times, it also certainly is the least perfect and impactful Nolan film for me.",Tenet
2443,ashkanxfx,A Very Good Netflix Film,7,23 August 2020,"I'm gonna make this short. This was probably one of the first big movies that was allowed to be screened during COVID19 so everybody was excited to be back in the cinemas but those excitements were short lived. Right off the bat, the movie hits you with some inaudible dialogues that makes you think if you are hard on hearing or if they are talking in another language. Then the movie starts to paint the picture and finally the finale which was more or less predictable for this genre of movies.
Pretty much everything in the movie from acting to visuals to music was a solid 3/5. After all, it's a Nolan movie and you cannot expect less.
I personally don't like watching movies that I won't understand well enough after once spending my money and time in a cinema. If a movie is going to me too complicated to be understood (to a reasonable level) in one go of cinema, it should be a Netflix or HBO or Amazon show so people can watch it over and over or pause and think. Watching these type of movies in cinema are waste of time and money and you will walk out feeling dumb and a ticket price poorer.

Totally different cinematic experience.Yes, there are flaws but these are tolerable when you let yourself go.Icannot forget the first 10 minutes. That feeling, bass pounding my heart. Always remember that.After movie ends, the taste in your mouth does not go away. There is an irresistible urge to watch again right after you exit the saloon

However, the concept is very complicated and after a while you are lost. I thought they were trying to stop this guy going backwards in time and then they tried to stop him sending the codes to the past. I mean didn't he already achieved that? This is how much I comprehended in this movie.Also, as a person who took thermodynamics in college the entropy explanation threw me off quite a lot. Explaining time travel by entropy is like saying if a car goes down a hill backwards in neutral, your fuel tank would fill up. It is that absurd.",Tenet

However all the people out there who didn't enjoy because it was void of true character and an emotional theme...it's hard to argue with them.I still enjoyed it A LOT.

2459,danny_1952,"Cartesian, but action-packed and fascinating",7,31 August 2020,"We are back from the movie theater where we went to see TENET. It's a kind of James Bond movie mixed with science fiction (temporal displacements) whose basic plot is simple: find the mysterious object that could annihilate our world.
But there are some inconsistencies in terms of temporal displacements or travel. No doubt Christopher Nolan will find all sorts of explanations for these apparent (if not obvious) inconsistencies.
What is always a bit disappointing in Nolan's films is that women play secondary or even ""thirdary"" roles. Women exist there only to be saved or killed. And his male and female main characters never manage to love each other completely. One always loves the other while the other does not love him/her or not as much. And his MCs are always caught between dream and reality (Inception), between past and future (Tenet), between this dimension and another (Interstellar) or even between different copies of themselves (The Prestige, Transcendance). This must be the consequence of his many trips between mom (Chicago) and dad (London) when he was a child.
So it lacks a bit of emotion as well. Or too preoccupied with giving us Action with a capital ""A"" and Special Effects with a capital ""S"", Nolan forgets about Emotion with a capital ""E"".
Despite these caveats, the film is worth seeing in theatres. The actors said they felt like they were really in the action. But they were really there. Everything is as real as it can be: the plane exploding, the cars speeding in reverse on the highway, etc. It's all as real as it gets. It's not just special effects on a green background. It's happening for real in front of our eyes. And it's fascinating.",Tenet

But hey, we liked other movies with this problem as well. This one did not convince me. It was well produced: good images, sound and action, but the story was contrived and not plausible at all. What inspired Nolan to this movie is obviously the sator square:
SATOR

You have to first of all pay full attention, keep your phone off and don't plan on bathroom breaks. This film is being derided by those who want to not have to think while watching and that's a shame. If you enjoy a film that will make you both pay attention and think, this is for you. There are so many hints and Easter eggs that Allude to the plot to come that are clearer in a second and third viewing. The concept and lore are riveting and the acting superb. There isn't much humor here, it isn't Marvel. Go in with the attitude of a bourne film and the tone will resonate better.The film hinges on you being able to feel through it and let it roll with you while thinking.Plan to see it twice.One negative, the sound mix isn't the best, could be the theatre I attended or just an immersion choice.Overall, a superb film but you can't lazily shut your brain off while watching and that won't be for everyone",Tenet

Not because I'm a simpleton, but because we tend to need to be able to hear the plot to follow along, and that wasn't always the case.
I remember sitting there growing increasingly frustrated as the time travel/rewind elements took center stage and left me struggling to understand what the hell was happening. It all looked incredibly good, and on the surface seems to work, but trying to think HOW it all works takes away from watching it work. Without an audible plot, that doesn't work. By the end, I was over it and waiting for the credits. I don't typically leave a film, but I would have left this one if it wasn't the first film I'd seen in theaters in months.
I'm hoping that a rewatch at home with subtitles will help.
The positives are with the acting performances of most of the main cast. Elizabeth Debicki didn't have anything to work with, but I really, really enjoyed Robert Pattinson here.
So I dunno honestly, see it if you want but be prepared to be confused and maybe try to shut your brain off. That might help? Or it might make it work.",Tenet
2466,j-hillier1999,"Christopher Nolan reaches above and beyond in a film that is visually stunning, often confusing and works 90% of the time",9,30 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan long ago established himself as one of the best film makers around. Tenet further cements his legacy as the smartest blockbuster director in Hollywood.
The film itself is set around JDW, ""The Protagonist"" who after a botched job, becomes aware of bigger things happening in the world that will affect the past, present & future. That's all I'll say about the plot as it's too complex to elaborate on.
The postives are that the cast are brilliant especially Robert Pattinson & Elizabeth Debicki whose charm and wit provide humanity to the story. But the film really shines when its action sequences take place. They are truly stunning, nolan has redefined what we think an action sequence should look like, they are unlike anything you've seen before. The cinematography is amazing, often with the camera letting you view the action from every angle. The downside is that when the film slows down, you start thinking about the plot which becomes more confusing as film progresses. It has similarities to Looper & Inception in tone, plot & style. Some people may be frustrated with not being able to understand it but if you can try and keep up it will be a terrific, visually mind blowing cinematic experience. See it in IMAX.",Tenet

I loved the interplay between time periods and it was those jumps that allowed some remarkable cinematography to shine! Everyone of the actors play their part in Nolan's unique viewpoint. I will probably view it again but I didn't find it to be difficult to understand, however I watched it on HBO with cc and not in a theater. It it was a James Bond film or a Mission Impossible screenplay it would be considered the best entry of either library. As a Christopher Nolan film it's an escape into his director brain and it wasn't dumb-downed for the Marvel crowd.",Tenet

I think Tenet may just about slip into the top 10 with a no doubt higher spot on my list after a few more views. Not because I'm a Chris Nolan fan boy (because Dunkirk doesnt do it for me at all) but I love the sense of impending doom in these movies that Nolan is so good at, and Tenet nails it. You're watching a straight forward (but very good) crime, heist style thriller for 50 mins to an hour, and when the penny finally drops, along with your pop corn and the rest of the audiences jaws, the movie slips into a gear that can only be described as.......well I cant describe it!! I've never seen anything like it. Absolutley mind blowing concept, epic visuals, phenomenal soundtrack, sensational set pieces, and award worthy performances (even Pattison, roll on The Batman). Like Inception before it I'm pretty sure there'll be stories within stories and twists and turns that I'm unaware of yet, hense my 2nd viewing being already booked for the coming weekend.

Anyway, I believe the movie will find it's audience, so it is worth watching, but I wouldn't expect too much.
I liked how the scenes were shot, and the actors did their job well.",Tenet
2470,danaimou,"Slightly disappointing (and no, not because I did not understand it)",7,15 December 2020,"Christopher Nolan does not underestimate the intelligence of his audience, and that goes for Tenet also. I love a thought provoking movie and not mind missing details on the first watch, if that means a more cohesive story, a compelling film direction and more enjoyable rewatch. I get it, the screenwriters were going for an interpretation of the ""one electron universe theory"" applied to macroscopic objects and people. They even briefly mention it at the beginning. I love the premise and the execution is stellar.
But I think this films fails at two important factors where Nolan has not gotten us used to failing before:1) Lack of compelling character development, drama and motivation: All previous Nolan movies, perplexing and masterfully weaved as they might be, are driven by characters and their compelling motivations (Cobb's desire to be reunited with his children and the drama with his wife in Inception, Cooper's relationship and longing to protect and keep his promise to his daughter in Interstellar, Angier's and Borden's passion and rivalry in the Prestige etc.). Not in Tenet, sadly. Here the protagonist is the generic good guy who would sacrifice himself for the greater good, and that's about it. His obsession with protecting Kat is unearned in the film and does not provide any solid driving force to the plot. Unfortunately, the only semi-fleshed out character is the antagonist, and that only to a minor degree. Overall, this leaves the audience impressed at the film, but not caring too much at the end.2) The musical score by Ludwig Göransson is on the same direction as the film overall, focusing on the intellectual aspects of the film and the action, but not eliciting any kind of human emotion that would drive the film on an emotional level for the audience. I think this was a choice (a bad one in my opinion), as Nolan seems to have been more focused on the novelty of the idea in this film and explores it on a technical ""what would happen if..."" level, rather than building a human compelling story around it.As an additional comment, people speaking and responding too fast in order to make things seem complicated but at the same time make the characters seem intelligent and on top of things has its limits. And these limits are reached when the audience has to rewatch not to mentally process, but to even hear and register precisely what has been said. This is exacerbated by screenwriting with ""witty"" dialog that skips one or two cognitive steps per turn to speak. This trick has been taken to its limits and beyond in this film, sadly.Overall an interesting, thought provoking film with excellent technical execution that sadly leaves the viewer unmoved at the end.",Tenet
2471,clanning-590-536121,Sycophants delight,1,30 August 2020,"Nolan takes on a fascinating concept but it's executed in such a way that if you don't have the benefit of prior knowledge, it's confusing, not to mention hard to hear A LOT of the dialogue due to masks, music and mumbling. Performances were strong but some of the writing was too on the nose and then not enough. He's onto something big here but misses the mark by a long shot. Unfortunately, the confusion makes word of mouth a risky proposition if only to encourage potential viewers to see if they can figure it out. Even though the film will definitely start conversations, the fans I was with (including myself) were unable to build a case strong enough in defence of their understanding of the movie.

But even not completely understanding the film won't stop you from enjoying the masterful work of Christopher Nolan and the cast and crew.

The sound mixing was so awful it made the movie almost unwatchable. Not being able to hear much of the dialogue over the noise and the horrible techno score became so annoying that I no longer cared about the twists and simply wished it all to end. The whole movie came off as a high concept disaster and noisy mess. By the time the ending tried to wrap it into a bow I no longer cared at all about the surprises or characters.

If you are the type of person who enjoys movies that force you to use your brain you will love this movie! The Matrix has been my favorite movie for 21 years, since 1999. Before that Interview With A Vampire was my favorite of all time. James Cameron's Avatar is close. Tenet is better than The Matrix. Christopher Nolan just moved himself into top three greatest writer directors of all time with thia film. He was already top 25. This movie puts him in the top three. Zack Snyder, M.

This movie IS hard to follow on first watching, as it deals with time reversal. It becomes easier when seeing it again. However, the confusing nature isn't so much from the plot itself as it is trying to wrap your head around how the characters are experiencing it. I will say that it's the kind of movie that you'll definitely want to pause if you get interrupted because there will be a good chance that you missed something.

2483,ASreeram,Why Tenet Wasn't Tenet,8,16 December 2020,"This movie had a lot going for it, even on top of Nolan's name. It could have potentially been a 10/10, but the poor explaining of exposition combined with Washington's subpar performance compared to the rest of the brilliant cast took me out of the experience quite a bit.The story is fascinating and contrary to what most are saying, it's not very hard to follow if you've dealt with time-travel movies in the past. Back to the Future and others have employed the concept in a much simpler and less convoluted way, but Nolan's intricacy only intertwines the movie more with a potential reality. The screenplay and direction was a definite 10/10.Washington's performance was probably the single most irritating point for me. I'm not sure if it was scripted to be as bland and dull as it was, but it seemed like his entire purpose throughout the movie was to seem unaware and confused (much like most of the audience) as to what was going on.This movie felt cut short. I know many have said it before, but even from line to line I felt as though something had been taken out. I would've gladly watched another 30-45 minutes if it meant having a better understanding of the characters and story, but unfortunately the original script (which I'm sure was incredible) had to get cut down massively to fit in into 2.5 hours.My review is titled as such because this was set to be a classic Nolan movie, with an intricate premise, stellar cast, amazing action sequences, and thoughtful message. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, it didn't quite hit the mark on some of these points, leading it to be one of his weaker films in entirety. I still enjoyed the concept and the dialogue was brilliantly scripted with Nolan's signature style of humor and dialect.Script = 9/10

Acting =7/10
Plot = 8/10Overall = 8/10",Tenet

It may mean a rewatch, or a watching explanation videos, suiting your own interest.My biggest problem was that I did not feel invested in the story at all. I think this was due to the mistake of the film that even though it is 2.5 hours long, it gives us very little character background, or development. Acting felt OK, with a surprisingly good performance of Robert Pattinson for me. However, most of the character background was spent of the antagonist (glad they did not call him that way...) and his wife, it could not get me invested.I feel like a rewatch could might increase its value, and understanding the punchline concept fully might have worth it, but the frigid storytelling and some logical errors make me unsure if I have 2.5 hours of my life to give it again.",Tenet

A plot for intellectuals to discuss and draw inspirations from in the coming centuries. This is a true masterpiece. But yes, in order to understand this film, you need to have some basic understanding of the Temporal Dimension, Thermodynamics, Cosmology, & War Strategies(Pincer movement). So don't take those 6 star ratings too seriously, they didn't understand the whole thing. It's not a linear story. It's too complicated to get it in the first watching.Just be prepared to lose your mind and spend the next 2-3 years pondering about how the F did they write that story and shoot those scenes.

-One of the worst sound mix I've ever hear. no focus, all over the place and whatever artistic choice you think it is, it doesnt work.
-No establishing shots when changing the scene/place, normally this can be made cleverly and not be an issue, but here it's really throwing the viewer off and killing the importance of the scene that preceded it.
Any action sequence and fighting are really lacking substance. Any punch falls flat and guns are not shooting half the time you hear the shots.Lack of context. You often don't know how they end up in fighting/shooting scenes. it just happens with no proper reason.Kinda pros:
cinematography is average, I wish it would be more clever.
Acting/dialogue has nothing memorable.
Music - great and modern
story - tense and grandiose
great vfx and practical fx - impressive and mind bending
locations - great",Tenet

Surely the editor could have at least said No! you can't have a confused looking Washington nod at the word 'Paradox' then move swiftly on to the next incomprehensible plotless scene acting like he knows what's going on.This is Nolan's disaster. His Heaven's Gate. Hopefully it's not the end of his career as Memento and Inception were good.",Tenet
2495,engin_ozdemir1,Typical Nolan...,8,10 October 2020,"Tenet is a new and crazy manifestation of his visual, auditory and ""temporal"" passions. Memento's backward-flowing narrative, Inception's characters wandering through layers, and Dunkirk's narrative of three different actions in the same war without being noticed in temporal terms, highly demonstrated that Nolan has a time fetish in every aspect. This time, the phenomenon of time spreads throughout the movie and the audience is felt, starting from the title. The Palindromic name, whose pronunciation is the same from both sides, is also reflected in the characters' relationship with time. The threat from the future but affecting the past, characters who can live the time in both directions, and the reversible flow make up the story in a compelling way, although a little confusing. At this point, we can contribute a line from the movie to the audience watching the movie; ""Don't try to understand it, feel it."" Because Nolan wants you to do this more.
In the movie, there is a main character who is often stated to be a hero. It is claimed that it will save humanity from a possible 3rd World War or, on the contrary, from the destruction of the world. The fact that Nolan has often stated that he wanted to shoot a Bond movie, being a stylishly dressed hero / agent and choreographically approaching the genre will immediately remind the audience of Bond movies through this hero. Bond atmosphere dominates the atmosphere in a significant part of the film. A Bond who is in the midst of temporal transformations, in gigantic scenes, and at the center of a science fiction story, must be exactly the character expected of Nolan. The fact that the character has to wear a mask while living an important ""time period"" in a scene has been added to the notes as an interesting coincidence for today. The fact that the opening scene of the film is watched in an opera house in a moment full of audiences and in a fatal manner will be remembered as a detail that adds coincidence. At this point, by the way, it should be said that the supporting characters and their formation contributed negatively to the film. The characters whose background is in the air, sometimes look cartoonish, who have a problem of credibility in their relationships, and their maneuvers in the story are a little damaging compared to the visual magnificence. After all, the movie will definitely become one of the most important movies for action cinema over the years. The movie, in which you will have difficulty understanding how 150 minutes passes, the perception of time is very well fed to the tempo, and we will see a lot of magnificent scenes, will tire even action lovers in a good way. The tempo is almost flawless, supported visually by a great job. Tenet has a dozen of successful action scenes that will be talked about a lot in a normal movie, even if there is only one, and they are all impressive. The stereotypical car chase scenes, the tension-filled moments at sea, the fight scenes, the well-planned airport scene, and many powerful scenes that don't come to mind at the moment of writing. Viewers who are addicted to action cinema will surely leave the hall to admire the movie.",Tenet

2497,JoviAero,Isaac Asimov vibes,9,19 September 2020,"Tenet was just brilliant. It was the perfect movie to go back to the cinemas with.
It's a very high concept sci-fi spy story that involves crazy time physics, but I won't give anything away. Just know that going in, you will need to pay attention to every word to follow along and even then you might get lost a few times. There was a good 45 minutes I had absolutely no idea what was happening but I came back around to it. It's definitely a ""see more than once"" kind of movie.I absolutely loved it though. I feel like Christopher Nolan just became the Isaac Asimov of the film world. I get a certain feel from Asimov novels that I've never felt anywhere else until now. If you're a sci-fi fan this is highly recommend. It's the same sort of high concept, hard sci-fi that I love Asimov's novels for, albeit with faster pace and more punching.There were great action scenes, great moments of tension, some humour here and there. Extraordinary special effects and cinematography that coellesced into some of the most unique movie scenes ever. It's very well paced too, two and a half hours and it flew by. Every scene was important and nothing bogged it down at all.Brilliant score, this is one of the first times in a long time that Nolan hired a different composer from Hans Zimmer, Ludwig Goransson who did a brilliant, synth heavy score that I hope to find on vinyl. It really elevated the movie in numerous ways.Acting was brilliant, John David Washington is new to me but I'd love to see him in more films. Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki were great as well, and it was a nice surprise to see Aaron Taylor Johnson toward the end.
I've seen some criticisms that the characters aren't well developed and that is true, they're very bare bones characters. But I feel like in a weird way the movie would have been bogged down if there was a bunch of backstory for everyone. In fact with it being a sort of spy film, knowing more about the characters may have ruined some intrigue and mystery.
It's a unique tale and I didn't mind just being thrown in with these people along for the very crazy ride.Another criticism I've seen is one I actually do agree with; the sound mixing was odd and there were moments the music or background sound made it hard to hear the dialogue. I'm not sure why it was mixed that way but when you already had to pay attention really close to the plot, that added another layer of unecessary confusion.I had a great time, I think this will become a classic in time, I really do. I cannot wait to watch it again. I'm going to get the 4K and rewatch and rewatch and analyze it.If you feel ready to go back to theatres, this is the one to see.",Tenet
2498,fishrobertson,"An intelligent, complex, brilliant, cinematic masterpiece but not a particularly thoughtful one.",9,29 August 2020,"Upon relaxing in my cinema seat to watch the highly anticipated epic from the acclaimed and renowned Christopher Nolan, I was immediately struck by the palpable atmosphere and the viscerally beautiful sound, cinematography and score that radiated around the room. After witnessing Dunkirk, Nolan's last film, I had wrongly assumed that he couldn't deliver an experience as cinematic and enthralling as the outstanding war epic and I withheld this belief until I was absorbed by the complex, layered world of Tenet which takes full use of all the theatres have to offer.First I shall mention just a few of the many, many positives and advantages of the this intriguing thriller:1. The Direction is once again inspiring, groundbreaking and profusely impressive, everything from the camerawork in the more quiet, introspective exchanges to the visual queues and general execution of the 'Inverted' action sequences and the intricately designed set pieces are directed ingeniously and work cooperatively with the dangerously complex script to provide an excellent display of Christopher Nolan's expertise.2. The Astonishing Score which was composed by the immensely talented Ludwig Göransson could easily be mistaken for something written by Nolan's usual collaborator Hans Zimmer and provokes reactions that include excitement, sadness, joy and intensity all in necessary amounts,3. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is a gorgeous and stupefyingly stunning display of insuperably beautiful colour grading and incredible camerawork.4. Although flawed and in certain areas underwhelming and undercooked, the script is expectedly intelligent, complex and perplexedly imaginative, inventive and rich and boldly throws itself headfirst into the lore of it's own creation and emerges victorious in providing an exciting and powerful puzzle that juggles the insurmountable narrative with seamless ease. For example what I can only describe as the inverted rooms scenario where Sator would interrogate The Protagonist with information he had inadvertently fed him beforehand in the 'Blue Room' and then uncover originally moments later in the 'Red Room"" in present day before alternating back upon noticing the reversed expression of his own face in the 'Blue Room' to start the interrogation all over again but in a loop and using information that the Protagonist was yet to give but already being blackmailed with.5. The Action is breathtaking and some of the best I've seen and never failed to both wow and entertain me throughout which is in part due to the sensational visual, technical and special effects.6. Although there are many, many more triumphs and successes when regarding the film as whole, there are also a few glaring issues which I will reference now.One of the few glaring issues that haunt what is an astoundingly persistent technical achievement is not the film's total absence of emotion but 'The Protagonist', a character that is utterly devoid of inner conflict, a character that despite an exceedingly charismatic and in actuality brilliant performance from John David Washington provides no captivating motivation for the audience to care and lacks the necessary and expected turmoil to be even half as good as Nolan's usual protagonists. Furthermore whilst I am on the topic of emotion and conflict, nearly all of said emotion is derived from Elizabeth Debicki's character, Kat, the soul of the film and the soul motivation for 'The Protagonist' who fascinatingly establishes a relationship that is dissimilar to the core relationships in most espionage or spy films, a relationship that is built on the empathy of 'The Protagonist' and the sympathy he feels for her rather than forced sexual attraction. Other than the character of Kat and the estranged relationship she withholds with her son, the film lacks emotion and is therefore driven by the performances of the lead actors which fortunately are excellent and amazingly dynamic (Even if Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of the villain is slightly campy).Another glaring issue is the overabundance of exposition which is more prevalent in this film than in any of Nolan's previous pictures and continues the trend that started with The Dark Knight Rises of expository action scenes. Contrarily these expository scenes are contradicted by yet another flaw the film displays which involves the apparent lack of logic with certain choices, especially when regarding emotion and the lost opportunities because of said lack of logic (For example our not seeing the young boys reaction to his father, Sator, being dead or the total omission of an interaction involving Kat and her son after the battle was won).The final impediment to the film is underwhelming and frankly disappointing exclusion of more prevalent and powerful theme, metaphors and ideas which have become synonymous with Nolan's thoughtful and socially aware blockbusters. Whereas Inception had something to say about the unruly escapism of drug taking, the avoidance of responsibility and the inaccessibility of a guilty conscious or a preoccupied, over-idealistic mind, this film's themes are present but not developed enough and therefore don't imprint a lasting impression on the viewer or all those that wish to have something truly think about upon leaving the cinema.Overall, despite a frustrating deficiency of both motivation, emotion and truly integral themes and an overabundance of exposition, Tenet still provides an intelligent, creative and imaginative script, extraordinary direction, gorgeous cinematography and camerawork, an unbelievable score and viscerally brilliant and dynamic action amongst many, many other advantages and pros that make this film more than worth the watch.9.1/10",Tenet

2501,VirusL4D,A revolutionary piece of filmmaking,10,28 August 2020,"As soon as I went out of the theatre after watching TENET, I was admittedly frustrated because I did not really understand what was going on in the second half of the movie. It felt like a huge bomb Nolan dropped on your brain and made it explode because there was so much information you had to process quickly to keep up with the storyline. And I'm saying this even though I never had any problem with understanding his previous works at the first viewing.But when I took my time to process everything and thought about all the elements of the film, I can surely say that this is Nolan's most ambitious work to date, call it his ""magnum opus"" if you will.1. The story is presented in the fashionable Nolanesque way of exposition through dialogue, although this time you will be thankful about any information given to you, because otherwise it would be really hard to keep up with the story. Besides from that the plot is given to you in a very precise and clever way through spectacular imagery only and never gives away too much. This keeps you invested in it and demands your full attention. Now I understand why Kenneth Branagh mentioned in an interview that the script feels ""like a puzzle"".2. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. Hoyte Van Hoytema took cinema to another level by showing us the amazing ""Inversion"" theme in a very practical and impressive way. You will see pictures you will never forget again, because it is that unique and unbelievable. I kept asking myself ""How did they film this?""3. The action sequences are extremely suspenseful and are always accompanied by the extraordinary score by Ludwig Goransson. This man is a huge talent and made me forget about Hans Zimmer missing this time around. The music fit the scenes perfectly and added to the tension tremendously.4. The acting was superb. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson were amazing and sympathetic. They perfectly worked together as a duo. Elizabeth Debicki surprised me as a very emotional character with own motivations. She nailed the performance. Kenneth Branagh will send chills down your spine because he is evil to his bones.5. The editing was tight and maybe that is why you could feel overwhelmed by all the information given to you while watching it. I wish the movie would have been longer and some scenes would have more room to ""breathe"". Maybe Nolan made some quick cuts on purpose to add to the tension of his famous theme ""Time is running out"", but personally I believe the film would have benefited from a longer runtime, since it is very complex and needs some time to process. Nonetheless it motivates you to watch it a 2nd or maybe a 3rd time to fully grasp everything.Do not get crushed by the complexity of TENET. Let it sink in for a moment and you will realize that it was a genius piece of art.This is a movie which will be talked about and dissected into its puzzle pieces for years, maybe even decades. It will take some time until it will be fully appreciated.Edit: After a 2nd viewing I can confirm that this movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. It was way easier to follow and much more enjoyable. After understanding the key scenes they become even more spectacular.",Tenet
2502,robertverschoor911,John David Washington. Make that guy the new James Bond!,10,25 October 2020,"Another brilliant movie from Christopher Nolan. I really loved this one. An excellent theme of perception of time, great actors, great scenes, awesome all together.

2503,paul_stokes91,Style but no substance (and horrific sound),3,28 August 2020,"Visually, this is a spectacular film. That's where the three stars come from. Other than that, this film is a car crash. For starters, I missed about half of the dialogue for a number of reasons. Sometimes it was because the score was too loud. Sometimes it was because the characters were wearing masks. Sometimes it was because the actors were mumbling (I'm looking at you Kenneth Branagh). Whatever it was, I had no idea what they were saying too often. And in a film this convoluted, hearing what is being said is pretty important.This leads me on to the narrative itself. I was lost after about half an hour. The concept is complicated and the scene that explains it doesn't really explain it all. Not clearly. Then things happen but it's not very clear why. Then some characters turn up with no explanation or introduction, then disappear again with no explanation. Things happen but I don't know why. Objects got inverted in the future but I'm not clear why that's the case. That could be because a character mumbled it or I'd stopped caring and lost the will to live and missed it. And frankly, after an hour, I didn't care what was happening or who survived or died.This film reminds me of Interstellar, which was also overly complicated and the dialogue muffled by an absurdly loud score. I'm beginning to feel like Christopher Nolan is aware that his time related films are really not very good and tries to stun us with sound and visuals to make us think we've watched a good film because he's the well respected Christopher Nolan so we're ""supposed"" to enjoy it. A poor effort after the triumphant Dunkirk.As a side note, I've noticed a lot of reviews saying you need to watch this more than once. If that's the case, then that defies the point of a film in my opinion. Why make a film that you need to watch more than once to get it? And I don't mean to pick up on some clever details. I mean to actually understand THE ENTIRE PLOT. I feel that Nolan is becoming arrogant as his reputation grows and that's not a good thing.",Tenet
2504,alex-achucarro,Amazingly lives up to the hype. Perfect post Covid icebreaker,10,28 August 2020,Having seen in two days ago I'd say it's his best film he's made. I was in awe at its ambition and Nolan's ability pulling it off. It is horrendously complicated but strangely logical. Cannot wait to watch it multiple times so I can experience those a-ha moments with foresight (a very apt approach to the film).Whilst not as fantastical as Inception or emotional as Interstellar I found it bizarrely believable and the 'time-travel' rules and constraints all made sense.Lovely emotional explanation towards the end if you're ever asking yourself 'why'.,Tenet
2505,owentheward,"This is a movie that needs more than one watch, for multiple reasons",9,26 August 2020,"Some may say this movie is too confusing. Sure, if your not into movies in which you have to think about what's going on (being a Nolan movie not sure why you'd watch it if this is the case) then this probably isn't the film for you. It's not your usual just sit back and watch what's happening. You really have to think about what is happening, really get stuck into the film. If you can do this, then you'll love TENET.I'm not going to pretend I understood everything that went on through the 2 hours 30 minutes, but I understood enough to know what was happening. If there's something you don't fully understand while watching it for the first time, don't think too hard in the moment, just accept that *something* has happened. The story works itself out in the end and you'll be able to understand the main plot. To be able to really understand the finer plot details, you'll need to rewatch it, probably several times.The bonus of rewatching to fully understand the finer details is you get to enjoy the incredible action sequences all over again. They actions sequences are immense, especially the one featuring time inversion in some way.I thought the acting throughout was great, Kenneth Branagh really stood out for me, really suits the roll of a bad guy very well. John David Washington put in a brilliant lead performance. I feel like Robert Pattinson seems to be the top choice for movies at the moment, and I can see why, I can't wait to see him as The Batman.Overall TENET is a very complex, but very rewarding story with outstanding action sequences. Multiple viewings aren't required, but I would strongly recommend them to be able to understand everything happening in every scene. I can't wait for it to be released on digital so I can really explore it deeper. Once again, Christopher Nolan has delivered.",Tenet
2506,racarvalhomv,Great great movie,10,6 December 2020,"Yes, Mr Nolan is a master at making films as well as Interstellar Inception and even Dunkirk but is not for everyone to think a little to admire a filmaker of this size.",Tenet
2507,babyjocko-76401,"It's very good, but..",9,21 December 2020,"The average moviegoer won't get it. They may like the eye candy action, but the average moviegoer will never understand the plot.Here is what I did not like about this movie:
1. The sound mixing won't win an award. It is awful. The dialog is hard to grasp due to its volume is too low compared to the score and sound effects. Add to that, accents, masks, and undertones, and plot complexity, it makes it virtually impossible to watch without subtitles.2. Of course, Nolan loves complexity - and he adds more complexity with his direction style. In this case, it is virtually impossible to fully understand this movie after watching it once. Those who say they got it after one viewing are either lying or they figured it wrong. It took me four viewings with subtitles. Your mileage may vary. But you won't get it after one viewing.Here is what I like about this movie:
1. The plot is rather ingenious. albeit paradoxical. If you like movies that make you think, this one is definitely for you. In fact, this movie is really just a cerebral puzzle. After watching it (however many times), you have to piece it back together.2. The movie is loaded with action visuals. There is not much downtime in between. And these scenes are absolutely spectacular - some of the best ever captured in a movie (highway scene; the fight in the freeport,...).3. Despite what many other user reviews claim, the characters and acting were superb! John David acted as though he actually believed it. Just look at his gesturing. His kitchen fight was bold and heroic! And the ""hot sauce"" line just had me rolling!To me, this is Nolan's best movie. I don't care for comic book movies. Farcical fantasy is just not for me. So, his Batman movies don't interest me. But I do like plausible science fiction. That being said, I liked Interstellar. Inception I did not like because its portrayal of dreams was ridiculous. Dreams have very little, if any continuity. I'm still waiting for Hollywood to do a remake of Dreamscape, which cleverly (for its time) portrayed dreams well. But, my next favorite Nolan film is The Prestige.BTW, I would have given TENET a 10 if it didn't essentially force you to watch it multiple times in order to get it.",Tenet
2508,valtsuvl,Improves towards the ending.,7,28 August 2020,"The beginning throws a lot at the viewer without really giving you time to understand whats going on. Hell, took me minute in the theater to realize the trailers had stopped playing and the movie actually began.There is a lot of exposition in the beginning, explaining the inverse time thing and talking about philosophical things which there is a lot of in this movie. A bit on the nose in my opinion and didn't really come as naturally as one might expect.There is 0 character building as well. 1 hr after watching the movie and I have no clue what the main characters name was. I'm not sure if anyone ever even said his name.The emotional bonding of the characters is also a bit lacking there are only 2 characters you really care about Pattinson and Washington and even them I didnt really care about. The emotional notes weren't really hit.What makes this movie though are the cool action moments of the inverse time and its ramifications on things. Interesting yet at the same time quite confusing. The clues and tricks through out the movie with the time mechanic started paying off more towards the end of the movie when you actually got to see the effects of the time inverter.At times a thought provoking film with some great action, yet nowhere near Nolans other masterpieces such as interstellar or inception as the movie itself felt more like an action romp even more so that batman for crying out loud. But the movies greatest fault has to be the total lack of emotional impact. During interstellar I bawled like a little girl yet during this didnt even feel like shedding a tear nor laughing. Lacks emotion is the problem, which leaves the movie feeling quite cold.But is it worth watching? Certainly but it's not in any way the masterpiece some people are claiming it be, but a good action movie and this is coming from someone that has watched nearly all of nolans films and loved them each.",Tenet

2515,cometatfullspeed,An absolute and stunning misfire,2,26 December 2020,"A relatively simple and generic thriller plotline is bloated and convoluted into an unrecognizable yet utterly hollow mess. The first 70ish minutes are literally just characters talking, explaining their motives, back stories, and the mechanics of the plot to each other. And yet I still struggled to follow how or why each scene stemmed from the previous. The proceedings do pick up considerably in the second half, but the film still suffers from never ending hurry up and wait.The ""reverse entropy"" science is explained enough to let you think you understand it, but also enough to know it makes little or no sense. The handful of fight scenes are largely boring. Besides a lone car chase, stunt sequences are just as boring. The plot requires a jet liner be crashed into a building for...reasons, I guess...and it's one of the dullest stunt sequences in years. And then for...again, reasons...the final act is set in a military warzone, even though we're never once shown an enemy combatant. And scenes throughout the film are edited so poorly they contain seemingly almost intentional (??) continuity errors.The protagonist is so devoid of personality, he's never even given a name- literally being called Protagonist in the movie. John David Washington sleepwalks through the entire movie, I assume at Nolan's direction. Kenneth Branagh repeatedly overacts and Elizabeth Debicki is wasted. Robert Pattinson is the only actor displaying any charm at all.This movie is basically Inception, but with all of the interesting and exciting elements removed, played backwards and forwards at the same time.

My Fiancé and I considered leaving early since we were so confused and had no idea what was going on, that there was no point in finishing the movie. But as the characters were explaining the movie, oftentimes, people would talk through masks, thick accents or even walkie talkies to the extent that you didn't even hear their explanations, let alone understand them.

2520,AdamNajim,"A psychological puzzling sci-fi, and a usual Nolan masterpiece",9,27 August 2020,"This masterpiece of Nolan with a great cinematography, great soundtrack, great visuals, great everything. A puzzling movie more like Memento will be hard to understand it even after revealing the answers there will always be a question of how? And Wait what?. Though the noises from the movie were too loud at some point loud action soundtracks, heavy drums, but maybe it's just me, my mind was very confused and tired after the movie trying to figure out the story. Overall it is exactly what you expect from a Nolan movie.
The movie starts with point A-B-C-D and then it switches back from point D-C-B-A, it starts with a tense sequence makes you think it's an action movie with gun shooting and terrorists and then the protagonist starts a mission to save the world and prevent world war 3 it will make you wonder what the hell is going on, through all the movie sequences and scenes you'll see situations where you still can't figure out what's happening until you reach point D where you'll find out the very interesting time travel. If you've seen time travel movies you might get an idea on how things work and the grandfather paradox.
Now explaining the plot and the idea of the movie:
Before reaching point D you'll see things happening before it happened like 3 gunshots already been shot in the window and then the guy who shot them shows up to take back those bullets to his gun and fights the protagonist (backwards). After you reach point D and find out about the time travel the protagonist will then enters the future and see the whole world going backwards, he will pass by all the sequences at points C,B and A. The protagonist will find himself in the same spots as his past self was, like the guy who shot the 3 bullets In the window and fought the protagonist in the beginning before point D, that's right it's the protagonist fighting himself in the past.",Tenet

But if you're not the kind to focus while watching movie, maybe you'll miss something somewhere.

This is kind of similar to what Dark series is. The only thing tenet added was reverse gravity and tried to make it more complicated by speaking fast and using loud sound effects. Frankly if you watch it in your home with subtitles on you won't find it difficult to understand.
People can go in the past and try to do things differently, only catch here is they will feel the wind and pedestrians going backwards. That's it.
But of course the story is really good which is always nolan's strong point and plot is the most important thing for me too.
Also the protagonist is extremely boring. Rob pattinson was much more interesting despite being a supporting cast. I don't know what he did in the auditions to get this role but he is bland.",Tenet

For most of the movie I felt like my hearing was going bad. The dialogue was almost constantly muddled by a combination of bad accents, speaking through masks and the extremely loud soundtrack. The first thing my wife asked me was ""did you understand much of what was said?"" so I knew it wasn't just me. And this is not the kind of movie where missing dialog will work. I can't remember the last time I watched an English language film and wished the whole time it had subtitles. I suspect that even if I could understand what was being said, the plot was still overly complicated. I didn't really care whether they saved the world or not. And even the ""good guys"" seemed like they were morally corrupt clear up to the end. This was doubly disappointing because there has been so little new content due to the pandemic that I had really looked forward to this. At least the visuals were relatively interesting.",Tenet

Maybe if I put the mask over my eyes it would have been a better experience. I believe there was a plot to this movie. However, I won't be watching the movie a second or third or fourth time in an effort to ""understand"" the plot. I was very disappointed by the cheesy dialogue and generally bad acting. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the Protagonist HAD died at the beginning of the movie---it would have been a very short movie which would have been a good thing.

With Tenet you know they're coming but your actually excited for them to happen. I personally was intrigued with every new twist to get further into the world of Tenet.John David Washington does an amazing job as the leading man. Any time the man shows emotion you can't help but believe him. Robert Pattinson, as always, delivers a great performance and his reveal at the end (which I won't reveal) was great because although you do suspect it, it is still exciting to see it happen.All and all a superb cast, amazing directing and writing, and a new world that I hope we get to explore more.",Tenet

The trailers looked awesome and I thought it would surely be a great innovative and new concept never seen before. Sadly, as complicated and convoluted as the plot was for this movie, I could not hear hardly any of the dialogue. It is IMPOSSIBLE to follow the story and understand what is happening because you can not hear what exactly the actors are saying. Everything from heavy accents, people wearing masks, and the sound effects over powering the voices made this movie very unwatchable. I felt like I was watching a foreign film majority on my time. Someone dropped the ball on this blockbuster! With the plot so difficult to follow as is already, this just made it 10 times worse. I enjoyed the bits and pieces of the film that I actually could comprehend. I'm sure once I watch it again with subtitles that it would be quite entertaining and enjoyable. I'm giving this film 4 stars for the little bit of the plot I could actually follow and the visual effects but don't spend your money to watch this in the theater or you'll be just as confused and upset as I was when it ended.

Not maybe from the side of actors but my eyes started to hurt very early in the movie where the reactions of the characters did not match the situation. Or do something completely silly, that many viewers will not notice. Ex. The scene were the guy does pull ups on the ladder, 30 feet up high for no reason at all.4. The dialogue, oh the dialogue. When even native speakers complain that can not understand a thing without subtitles, something is really wrong here. And no, It has nothing to do with range compression or sound quality.

Why anybody with a technology capable to reverse time would try to obtain anything by force rather than some smarter plan is only a mystery until you realize the script HAS TO contain expensive SFX and action scenes to sell to the average audience.Ironically, a much shorter high concept sci fi movie with a way lower budget like Primer is ultimately far more interesting to rewatch and piece together than this $200M production.

The whole time I was trying to connect the sequences.
Sound is bad. Background music makes it hard to understand what the characters are saying. This movie certainly needs rewatch.

2543,bairvine-01227,Nolan creates magic once again...even if your brain melts a little,8,31 August 2020,"We went to the movies last night and it felt damn good. ""Tenet"" is directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan and our first theatre experience since the lockdown was certainly not a relaxing one. If you thought ""Inception"" was tough to crack then brace yourself for a much more challenging watch but also one that is very rewarding.""Tenet"" explores the idea of time-inversion and the role it can play in both causing and preventing catastrophic events. John's David Washington's protagonist learns the rules of this game and is brought on board to help prevent the apocalypse. The complexity of this story may go without saying but from a visual standpoint - watching it unfold was an absolute joy to watch.Nolan, yet again, pushes the limits of blockbuster filmmaking with massive and inventive practical effects. The scale and design of the action set pieces are of the highest quality and there are numerous moments when Ludwig Göransson's score swells with the chaos on screen and reminds me of just why I love going to the movies. Hoyte Van Hoytema has worked with Nolan since ""Interstellar"" and every frame of this film is absolutely stunning to look at.For a film as epic and complex as ""Tenet"", we rely on exposition and having the information from the world delivered in a coherent and competent way. While the sound design for the action was incredible, the dialogue was very hard to hear. After reading a synopsis of the film there were a lot of details from the story that I missed and left me confused a number of times. This may be an issue with IMAX but I have seen many similar complaints which makes me think otherwise.The performances are all very good but because the details of the narrative are so dense, the screenplay doesn't dedicate a lot of time to making you care for the characters. This mostly works for ""Tenet"" because exploring the time-inversion requires a lot of the runtime but giving us a little more to attach ourselves with the characters could have led to a stronger emotional journey.Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite filmmakers and movies like ""Tenet"" just cement my adoration for his work. He challenges the viewer's expectations because doing so leads to pure creativity in both story and visual design. Additional background for the characters and tweaking with the dialogue mix could have had some improvements but ""Tenet"" is most definitely worth seeing and experiencing on the big screen...just don't forget your mask!",Tenet
2544,pauls-25727,Another Masterpiece,10,6 November 2021,"This is another masterpiece from the legend Mr Nolan. I've enjoyed all his movies apart from Dunkirk for some reason, maybe I expected too much from it or that it was a bland story with brave civilians based on a true story.From the opening I knew I'd really enjoy this after watching the trailers a few times and reading up on it. I loved the time travel aspect keeping entropy stable and how it all worked. I watched it twice back to back just like I do with all his other movies apart from yes Dunkirk.Some people hate the protagonist but I found him enjoyable to watch and a decent end job acting in this. The other actors stood out on their own merits especially Branaghs character, played perfectly.Will I watch this again....definitely just like I do with 2 others of Mr Nolan's movies being Inception and my favourite movie ( top 3 ) Interstellar ( I love space themed movies not matter what they are about I'll give them a try ).Overall I gave it 10/10 because for me it was perfect with just a few flaws. Highly enjoyable experience.",Tenet
2545,amanfra,Nolan tried too hard,6,19 September 2020,"First off... loud. So loud. Secondly, you could've actually turned up the volume on the actors speaking so I could hear them try to explain this jumbled storyline (this movie could've used TARS to run down the entire plot at the end like he did for Interstellar lol). I get what Nolan was trying to do here. He rarely starts a film where anything makes sense and you just have to keep watching to figure it out. So I dont think it's that the plot is overly complicated. I just think Nolan doesn't show you enough to let it sink in, or even care that much. For example, the main character is crying like a big baby at the end because he realizes something, and I was just sitting there not caring. Also, I think the main final sequence in the film lacks the same kind of timely composure that Inception had in it's finale. Tenet was sloppier and not set up well enough for it's finale to feel satisfying. This had the general style of Inception but far less enjoyable or comprehensible.",Tenet

I'll absolutely watch it again to pick up on the (myriad I'm sure) details I missed; on first viewing, though, I found it intriguing, puzzling, fascinating, and entertaining - but by no means out of reach, shallow, or lacking motivation. I still preferred Inception (one of my forever-favourite movies) but that isn't to say I didn't really enjoy the mind-bender that is Tenet.(A note on sound: I watched at home in 4K with headphones and subtitles, however didn't find the mix as appalling as some reviewers have.)",Tenet

2552,johnhuot,Very cool! Meant for the large format medium.,9,2 September 2020,"I'll try and keep this brief. ""Tenet"" is Christopher Nolan's latest film, and this time around he introduces audiences to a reinvention of the spy genre. I will admit there are a few times in the movie that are confusing, and that's only because there's a lot happening. I would say upon your first viewing try not to think too hard about the films explanation, but try and focus on the experience for what it is. Then later you can go back and re watch it a few more times. I think that'll be the most rewarding thing about this movie, being able to rewatch numerous times, and always getting something new after every viewing.I don't think this was done intentionally, but there were a few scenes and you'll know once you'll see them, but a few scenes almost felt like nods to earlier Nolan movies, and that's just something die hard Nolan fans will really appreciate I think?I think the opening sequence might be right up there with The Dark Knight Bank heist. It's just so beautifully shot and assembled, it starts off by batting a hundred, and really starts the movie perfectly.I hope this vague review is convincing enough for you to give this film a chance. I would recommend seeking out an IMAX 70MM venue, and if that's not available then perhaps an IMAX laser venue.

Before watching the movie I have read many spoiler free reviews about Tenet that this movie is not as good like that of Nolan's previous works, and I was kinda disappointed to see my favourite filmmaker to be criticised like that, but still I wanted to see Tenet. I'm not saying that this movie was way better that Inception and Interstellar. If Inception and Interstellar are at 5 than I waill give Tenet 4 or 4.5. And for Tenet, Yes the plot is very complex. But what should we acknowledge here is the boldness with which different concepts being introduced in Tenet ; Time inversion, Turnstiles, Temporal Pincer movements. I mean come on we have never seen these things before; car chase sequence and crash in reverse, buildings re-forming and then blown away, hand to hand combat sequence in reverse and forward at the same time. Just look at the technicalities, efforts, vision and all the hard work behind this masterpiece as we all know that there's no CGI. Yes, you read it ""a masterpiece"" and I think this movie ahead of its time, this is its flaw. Tenet should have been released some years later. And yes Tenet lacked the emotional character arc in terms of friendship between Neil and The Protagonist, they should have focused more on their friendship and give it a emotional touch like they did in Inception and Interstellar which connected to the audience.
I'm giving Tenet 10/10 for all of its new concepts, the way the scenes were shot and the experience I felt watching Tenet in Theatres. I mean seriously it was AMAZING!!! In theatres

But it read like a beautiful book if you're familiar with Nolan's style of movies. Tenet was the perfect thrill and I enjoyed watching every minute.

2561,menzoderks,"Interesting, but unclear and has little soul.",7,1 September 2020,"I have watched Tenet twice now where the audio has problems in my first watching only. Now I have seen it the second time I can grasp the film far better, but did not enjoy the movie more per se.What made it hard to understand the first time was the protagonist jumping from location quite often with minimal explanation. The time manipulating element in the film (which I won't spoil, but only criticize) is quite clever in the second act, but extremely hard to grasp in the third. The second watching made it clearer but there is a large action scene there in the 3rd act that is just really hard to follow. My gf and I were sometimes wondering if they were fighting themselves as the baddies look almost identical.
Also some parts of the time manipulation thing seem to be break logic a bit, but because of spoilers that's all I have to say about that.
In terms of character's the protagonist doesn't really have an ark and I didn't really feel the emotional connection he had to other characters. I also found his acting notably bad in some dialogue scenes. Pattinson is pretty good but he doesn't have much to work with.
It is actually very comparable to inception although it does not have as much exposition, and doesn't have leonardo dicaprio we can really connect with. Leonardo longed for his wife and kids. The protagonist in Tenet does not have this connection or acting talent.
For the rest there were some decisions characters made that put the mission at risk which I found weird. The action scenes were sometimes pretty good but nowhere near the heights of Nolan's other films.
The music was although unique very jarring sometimes as it could be so loud that nothing else could be heard. It can take you a bit out of an action scene where the dark knight had a better balance of the music being loud and softer in bits. They've gone a bit too far with it here.
All in all I found movie clever in parts, bit illogical in others. Character development was almost non existent and plot hard to grasp. It is imo the worst of Nolan's films.",Tenet

I find it hard to believe that Christopher Nolan birthed this BS.

So much of this movie just isn't explained at all. I'm a fan of most other Nolan movies and while they're confusing they're always engaging and gripping nonetheless, but this movie is an exception, I found myself dozing off in the cinema for the last hour of the movie because I was just so bored.",Tenet

2566,marialaika,Pointless action in a 20 minutes plot,2,5 September 2020,"It's the first time in my life I wanted to leave the cinema.
Basically, Nolan started with the premise ""Oh, backwards frames would look cool for a travelling to the past"" and didn't elaborate anything else on it. Just a waste of time and money.Maybe I was overexcited about the idea of coming back to an actual cinema in months, but my disappointment was so big that I left during the end credits, which I never do. It doesn't matter anyway, because they were simple white over black in an overused Gotham Font.That's right, the first thing I hated is the fact of a lousy Main Title over the face of the protagonist, with a huge action-packed beginning, without any type of intro or setting. They were so focused on creating a pointless time-travel backwards, explosions film that they forgot that maybe setting up an intro would help to get in the mood of a confusing film. I know is the fashion nowadays, but I think It would definitely help in this case.Then again, they were so focused on pointless time travelling and explosions, that the characters are plain and uninteresting. The ""super bad"" has to be an abuser (oh, no, surprise! He hits the woman!) and the hero has to save this woman, just because. Sexist approach, once again.I will finish saying that this Main Title didn't correlate with the Main Title at the end...

The confusion doesn't take away any of the fun. But in the last parts of the movie, things get way too chaotic and i couldn't understand anything.

Maybe at some point we'll get a commentary track for it. I needed to there are just so many great details to be realized. The track with the railways was on the nose in order to let you know to watch out for such things. You see trains going in both directions simultaneously, you don't know which is coming and which is going. It's a metaphor for time. This is highlighted when the clock is turned back. Then there is the wind turbine, you could see that a chrysalis of sorts. He has blossomed from a normal person to a trusted agent and in doing so has started masterminded the game that he is playing. On the second watch through his ruse of preferring 'soda water' (in order to throw off what looks to him like a would be enemy someday) falls flat on it's face.You'll notice the protagonist is careful with words, the same way the antagonist is mindful of his heart rate.

2584,AllenPham,It's one of those movies that demand your full attention.,8,12 November 2020,"Christopher Nolan continues to envision new ways of telling a thrilling story using the subject of Time. From the nonlinear back and forth of Memento, to the continuous ticking of Dunkirk, Nolan has mastered keeping his audiences at the edge of their seats while they unraveled the new concept of how he wants to define Time, and Tenet is the same. Tenet is an action-packed, sophisticated heist movie, with an idea that will leave you scratching your head only to give up in confusion. But, once again, leaving the theater thanking Nolan for his brilliants.Tenet falls short in areas like shallow and cliche characters and the head-scratching concept of Inversion that made the audience work too hard without the same rewards compared to movies like Inception and Memento. Instead of leaving the audience in an AHA moment with an ounce of mystery to wrap up their own endings, Tenet leaves you with more questions rather than answers and a timeline with endless possibilities. It's confusing, to say the least.What it lacks from other movies, it makes up in bringing back the full cinematic experience. A needed movie in 2020 when theaters have been closed for most of the year. Tenet is a reminder that certain movies need to be watched in theaters (and in IMAX) to fully immerse yourself in the sight and sound of what the writers, directors, cinematographers, music composers, editors, etc. envision. It's one of those movies that demand your full attention for 2h and 30min and you're lost in their world, where your reality is gone. Tenet isn't just a movie that you watch -- it's a film that you experience.",Tenet

But when I got out I looked it up and found that the movie just had this painfully bad sound mixing. Dialogue was very difficult to understand the first time I watched it but the second time, I understood it better. I even asked the front counter for the caption glasses they provide, I wish I got them the first time.The acting was spot on, I believed the characters were the characters and not the actors (well obviously Michael Caine was a bit difficult but you know what I mean). The actors were perfect for their roles.Soundtrack fit perfectly throughout the entire film, but at some parts, as I stated earlier, it was way too loud and you couldn't understand the dialogue as well as you would like, which is a shame because the dialogue is pretty crucial to the understanding of the movie.All in all, I'm happy I watched it a second time, because I definitely knew what to listen harder for. Christopher Nolan, while sometimes a bit too full of himself to let the audience understand dialogue, has an insane mind to be able to think of the things he thinks of for his movies. Would definitely recommend you watch, but not in IMAX, it's a bit loud.",Tenet

2588,vilovian,Playing Early in Korea,7,22 August 2020,"I was surprised to see it playing here in Korea but I took the risk and went to my local theater.
The trailer reveals the stakes involved so I am not giving much away but I will say this I didn't feel a lot of tension based on those stakes. My attention was mostly focused on the developing story rather than having any time to process the dire consequences of our protagonist's possible failure. The plot can be overwhelming and confusing at times. A lot of the exposition happens in quick conversations so important details are easy to miss. Although, the movie doesn't honestly require you to understand everything to enjoy it. I didn't experience irritation over my confusion. I allowed the movie to take me along it's journey.
Kenneth Branagh had a difficult role in playing the ""ultimate"" villain. In my opinion, his character was a weak-point of the movie. His motivation seemed unbelievable to me. There wasn't a lot of time spent developing his character to make his intentions believable. I think the same goes with all the characters really.
I will say that I was not bored in the least throughout the whole runtime. It definitely is an engaging movie but one that could've benefit from more time fleshing out the characters which would've made the stakes seem higher and elevated the movie.
I did like it enough to know that I will re-watch it at some point (mostly to pick up the finer confusing details) but I may wait until there is a streaming release for it.",Tenet

Or how do you pick something off the ground that's been left for you from the future, since (if you are moving forward), you actually remove the item from your future?Cool idea though and definitely a cool movie that's worth seeing, but the fiction doesn't add up, which is usually the case with Nolan movies.",Tenet

I watched it a couple of times at home with captions and volume leveling enabled.The first watch through was entertaining but definitely left me confused. Some of the action set pieces are great and the locations are interesting. Robert Pattinson plays a cool sidekick character who comes and goes while John David Washington is oddly calm through just about everything that comes his character's way.After the first watch, I read numerous explainers online and found diagrams attempting to make some sense of what I watched. The film seems to desperately want you to focus and think a lot about it, but the more you do, the more it just falls apart and becomes nonsensical. It's just a movie and to its credit, it does at least try to explain away some of its inconsistencies. (Make sure you're paying attention to every line of dialog, some important pieces come and go quickly.) As a total package though, it is far less successful, entertaining, and satisfying than Nolan's other time-bending films. It's also at least a half hour too long.",Tenet

Yes the plot is quite complicated and Nolan indeed hid a hell lot of information in the scenes which are quite easy to miss if you are not paying close attention consistently. Yet it really feels satisfactory to be able to put all these clues together and see where the plot is actually going to. Acting by John David Washington and Robert Pattinson is excellent and the tension can be felt throughout the two and a half hour. One minor detail that is not so great about this movie is that the dialogue is quite hard to catch as the background music is really loud, which I know is necessary because of the atmosphere it is trying to create here. Another thing is that personally I feel that the storyline can be extended a bit longer as the transition at the ending feels somewhat abrupt to me.

Also dialogues are faster than light. It is already so hard to understand or follow the movie and fast dialogues make it impossible. Guess that was not enough they also added some Phisics. You are already having so much difficulty throughout the movie with all theese reasons, and raid progression of story is making you so much tired at the end. What I mean is movie doesn't want you understand itself, when you are close to understand it, it is giving you brand new things. I had huge expectation from the movie, I wanted to love the movie but I think that is not possible because how can you love a thing that you are not even close to understand?

So loud where i had to literally plug my ears during action scenes. So loud where I can't understand what is being said even in the non action scenes. Dialogue is drowned in useless music. The movie is unwatchable without subtitles. I was so confused as to what this movie was about. At the end of the movie, I left more confused then I was going into it.Second of all, pretty bad acting all around. Especially the protagonist. I mean come on. B level acting. Try harder my guy.Third, wayyyyy too complicated for the sake of being complicated. Just uninteresting. I couldn't wait to get out of there. The movie dragged out for way too long. My ears were about to burst. Watching people shoot at other people for who knows what.Conclusion, don't waste your life on this. I have aged a good 10 years after this experience.

2601,tranquilityoak,An incomprehenisble mess (with cool effects?),4,28 March 2021,"Nolan appears to have been drunk on Inception's and Interstellar's success when he thought of making Tenet. Here are my objections:1) If you're gonna make a movie where the plot ties near the end, maybe don't have half a million irrelevant, jumbled threads in your movie, especially when half of those threads run in reverse time. Simply put: no normal human being will be able to follow, especially when after introducing a concept like reverse time which humans haven't evolved to understand.2) I genuinely felt that everyone in this movie except for Pattinson was miscast. Branagh? Nope. Debicki? Nope. Washington? Nope. I genuinely clicked on this movie because I loved Washington in BlacKkKlansman. Little did I know I'd be sorely disappointed in his lackluster, deadpan performance here. Kudos for the physical feats, though.3) What in the mercy is wrong with the audio? Did Nolan hire the audio team off of Craigslist?4) A consummately evil Russian dude with no apparent motive vs. The heroic selfless CIA agent out there to save the world? What is this, Did we fall into some reverse time whizz-doo turnstile and travel back to the McCarthy era? Give me a break.And no, I won't ""watch again"" to finally achieve enlightenment and understand the super genius galaxy brain concept behind this mess. I have things to do, and frankly, I have better movies to watch.Nolan successfully pulled off temporal mumbo-jumbo with Interstellar and Inception. Looks like third time is the opposite of charm. 5 stars for the filming and effects, -1 stars for the story.",Tenet
2602,thanhph-98193,Nolan never disappoints,10,28 August 2020,"Usually it's always about what a movie has to offer instead of what it lacks. To shorten up: Tenet has no unnessecary dialogues or long scenes that want to add a dramatic touch, not much of those short sentences that are repeated in almost every action thriller from characters to show off cool, no excessively overdone CGI or introduction of every character, no deep love story that takes over the whole movie or characters that act just pure out of emotions, even their emotional intentions seem well planned.
Because Nolans script misses all those 'typical' things and adds up all the intelligent content, screenplay, speeches, plot etc. it's a really well-minded and thoughtful movie. The story just continues without hesitation, Tenet never stops to focus. The editing is so fluent, and even though you might get confused sometimes or need to catch up with it, it's really enjoyable.
There's so much room for interpretation in almost every spoken sentence. And a whole different way to play with the interpretation of time.",Tenet
2603,brandondubs,Nolan does it yet again,9,6 September 2020,"This is definitely his most complicated and confusing plot thus far.
The first hour was spent trying to catch up with what was going on on the screen.
However, once the concept of ""inversion"" started to become more clear, the movie became more enjoyable than it already was.Seeing this film in IMAX was an incredible experience.
The combination of the soundtrack, volume, and cinematography on screen had me on the edge of my seat. (The volume was almost TOO loud, but it made it very immersive)
My only gripe with the film which seems to be pretty common is the dialogue audio is sometimes hard to hear; the soundtrack seems to be prioritized over the dialogue during scenes when characters are having conversations, and that can make things even more difficult during an already confusing, hard to follow movie.Debicki and Pattinson were particularly fantastic in this film.Don't expect to fully grasp the concept or the story completely by the end of your first viewing.

These notes were written during the movie, about 1.5 hours in, after I completely lost all investment in the plot, acting and dialogue.1. The dialogue is like a game of ping-pong, not what you'd expect from seasoned pros making a high budget film.2. In the writing, the plot is over-explained yet unclear...3. The sound is terrible - music and sound effects loud, vocal delivery mixed low and seems like actors are often whispering...4. The characters have virtually no depth, and I mean all of them. The baddie especially disappointing.5. The script is very dull, confused and amateurish.6. The photography and special FX save the film.Fundamentally this movie is trying to be Inception, and fails.Best part of the film is watching things go backwards, but even that looks awkward/staged/goofy at times.I've seen reviews saying to watch this twice, that's really not the point of a movie especially not one that lasts 2.5 hrs.",Tenet

If someone came up to you and said ""by the way, you can reverse time"", do you immediately accept it and shrug it off? That was how the whole concept that is the film was introduced. The main character simply accepts the whole idea of reverse time even though none of it makes any sense whatsoever. It seems to me this is a film around a concept that would be cool to film (two directions of time operating simultaneously) but completely ignores plot and character development. And since when does an intelligence agent ever get that emotionally involved in a target as he did in this film? Others mentioned the audio issues, which I agree with completely.

What the hell just happened ??One of my biggest issues with the film was its attempt to explain ""tenet"" (the mechanism by which things can go backwards in time). Unfortunately, I don't think it does a good job of doing that. And even if I went back to watch this film a second time and realized that Nolan did, on the contrary, explain it well, this mechanism is still just too damn confusing to begin with! In my opinion, it distracts from the story....and well... this leads to my next problem with the film....what's the story again? They have to save the world from World War 3? (DEEP sigh). I know I shouldn't try and compare this film to Chris Nolan's magnum opus (in my opinion), Inception, but it's hard not to. Even if the audience didn't understand how ""inception"" worked, they were still caught up in a story about a man doing everything he could to see his kids again, while also dealing with the death of his wife and his complicity in it. Great !
In TENET, there's nothing about the story that grapples the audience in any way. We don't know anything about these characters. We don't understand any personal motivations for ""saving the world"". Were it not for objects and people going backwards in time, this movie would be like every other heist film....and I'm sorry to say this (as a another big fan of Nolan), but not one of the great ones.I still love you Nolan!

2616,tuboxa,Reviewing Reviews (Sort Of),5,4 January 2021,"Many positive reviews of Tenet suggest that you either need to watch it twice or see it in IMAX where it was meant to be seen (or both). The problem with these caveats is that first a movie actually needs to make you want to see it and second, it will only be in IMAX for a small sliver of time.I did not find it hard to understand the plot of this movie. Time inversion is reversing the flow of time for select items/people and a evil doer wants to stop time from continuing at all.Are there amazing moments in Tenet? Yes. Visually speaking it's a masterpiece practically, but the story is almost secondary to the action and spectacle.The audio was bad but everyone has complained about that so I'll just say I agree with that.No. I shouldn't be forced to watch a movie I didn't like the first time just to pick up on a few other things or to fully experience some moment since I already know what's going to happen. I also shouldn't be forced into going to a specific screen to experience it a specific way or it won't be as effective. If these are the case than you are not making a movie, you are making a limited experience much like an amusement park ride.",Tenet

2618,Treammolb,"A daring, but unintelligible mess",5,8 September 2020,"Tenet, the latest outing by director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar) presents an interesting and ambitious idea, that has been done amazingly well and attempted horrendously even more times: the concept of time travel. Tenet falls somewhere in the middle between these two maxims. The distinguishing element in Tenet as compared to other time travel movies is the world building: when characters go back in time, they have to abide by certain rules, such as that certain elements work in reverse (when hit by a flame, you get cold instead of hot, for example). It also seems objects can go back in time, meaning you can shoot someone, by having shot somewhere earlier, and the bullet then flying back in time. I say seems, because the concept is never very well explained. Early on one of the scientists who attempts to explain the mechanics says so early on ""don't try to understand it, feel it."" That message is apparently supposed to be taken literally, as you will often be left wondering what the hell is going on.I will make a note here, however, that there is a chance the film does a glorious job explaining the mechanics. However, the sound mixing was horrendous. Ludwig Gorannsson (Black Panther) delivers the score, which aggressively pulses through the film at nearly all times. Nolan continues his trend of accompanying every scene with music: both a casual sitdown at a restaurant, as well as the action scenes. This works very well for the action scenes, but not for the dialogues, as the score drowns out the dialogue, making it increasingly frustrating to figure out what is going on. Sometimes the background noises in an environment add to the plight of trying to understand the dialogue; there is an unbelievably frustrating scene on a boat where due to the waves not a lick of dialogue can be understood. It is an odd choice in a film which requires the viewer to pay attention to try and figure out what is happening due to the novel time travel technology. Nolan also employs lots of crosscuts between scenes where mechanics are explained, plots are hatched, and put in motion, all in one crosscut. So, within 60 seconds, you switch between constant cuts of two characters discussing an important element of how the time travel works, the same two characters in a different location devising a plan to use this element, and then another scene intermixed where the preliminary work of said plan is put into motion. Combine this with the pulsating synths, and the viewer will have a wonderful time trying to keep track of what is going on.This issue is exacerbated due to the fact that not much time is given to actually process anything, because when the action kicks off, it all occurs at a breakneck speed. Nolan still hasn't figured out how to shoot action scenes, managing to film the action in confusing angles and make puzzling cuts that make the action even harder to follow. Due to the time element, where multiple timelines at times align, the action becomes even harder to follow, which is a shame, as some of the setpieces are amazing in scale and action. The time travel causes magnificent action to unfold, with timelines colliding, certain characters appearing both as their future and present selves, future selves going backwards, while present selves are moving forward, which all leads action scenes that have not been experienced before. Sadly enough, you're still trying to figure out what was done, well after an action scene is completed. You're seeing magnificent action appear in front of you, but you just don't know what or why it is happening.It also feels the time mechanics were underused. Early on you see a a bullet hole from a bullet that had not been fired yet, and I was expecting tons of ingenious scenes playing with this idea and trying to push it to its limits. People managing to jump into planes (by somehow going back in time from when they jumped out of it earlier), characters littering a room with bullets, waiting for the impending arrival of the antagonists and then unleashing all the bullets back into the gun hitting the enemies, etc. Instead, this comes back very sparingly in the first half. This gets amped up a lot more in the second half, but, as mentioned before, you still don't truly understand what is going on, making the action feel somewhat dull despite how much of a technical feat it all is. In a sense, Tenet could have done away with the attempt at trying to appear as an intellectual movie and have just given the characters superpowers, instead of trying to come up with contrived rules on how the timetravel mechanics work, as you won't be able to understand the rules anyway.There is a core issue at the heart of Tenet, however, and that is that it doesn't touch you emotionally: you don't understand the characters, and you don't feel anything for them. In Nolan's previous efforts, of which Inception is probably the best example, as it seems like Tenets spiritual predecessor, you care about the characters. Cobb and Mall had their tragic love story where they went too far with their powers and lost everything they held dear. Cobb's constant fear of getting lost in the dreamworld, or, perhaps, his desire to be there, warring against each other. His constant mission to be reunited with his children versus him missing his wife. Behind every action scene, there were high, personal stakes. This is the issue with most action movies: you don't care about the destruction of a skyscraper or the explosion of a planet, if there is no emotional connection to any of these events.Tenet shares this problem as the characters all seem emotionally detached from the film's plot which centers around stopping an evil mastermind of destroying the world. The Protagonist (this is the character's name, he is never given an actual name) ironically is just that, an empty shell, an infallible character, with no emotional connection to the plot. Then we have Neil, a mysterious agent, so mysterious that you know nothing about him until the very end and so anything he does carries no emotional weight. Kat, is the only one with personal stakes as she is married to the evil mastermind and he is holding her hostage, but she seems more like a constant damsel in distress that just needs saving and actually seems to have nothing to do with the main plotline. As her struggles don't seem to connect with the actual plot of the film, the plot has no emotional weight to it. Even if it did, however, it still wouldn't help, as the film almost solely focuses on the Protagonist and his mission to save the world. Perhaps the film would have worked better if she was more part of the core of the film and got more agency, lending higher personal stakes to the overall plotline, but instead we follow the Protagonist and Neil completing action scene after action scene in an attempt to save the world from an evil mastermind whose rationale you don't understand, by using time travel mechanics that you don't understand, and saving Kat for a reason you don't understand.All in all, it's a daring attempt at a idea that has been done many times before, but not yet done in a manner so ambitious. However, the dumbfounding decision to play music over all expository dialogue, failing to make the viewer feel emotional connection to the characters, and subpar cinematography and editing makes this more of waste of potential than anything else.",Tenet

The acting is not bad, but when the script of a movie is so incredible silly, it is hard to appreciate the acting no matter how hard the actors try.
The FX also is cheap; filming a bunch of explosions and cars flipping over, and then running the playback equipment in reverse. Give me a break. I noticed it is getting harder and harder for movies to get good ratings nowadays (probably because viewers are getting spoiled watching longer-running series where the characters can be built up better) but why THIS idiotic movie suddenly got such a high review; it is a complete mystery to me.

However, the reason the plot is hard to follow is that during production they purposefully decided to leave out key information from the beginning of the movie that would have allowed the majority of the audience to understand that plot (Like almost all other movies with a complex concept) and instead dotted this key information throughout the movie (mostly towards the end) this is why people are saying that they understand after watching it twice as they now have the basic information that should have been given at the start.The hard to follow plot is made far worse with the complete lack of pacing, scenes move on and switch at the speed of light with little to no explanation as to what is happening and why.Quite frankly making the movie in this way is a middle finger to the majority of the audience as an ego rub for the writer/director Nolan.

2630,Done1517,A cinematic experience.,8,2 September 2020,"First of all: I am a damn huge Chris Nolan Fan. Inception, Prestige, Dunkirk, Interstellar, everything great movies.
So Nolan wanted to make his own Bond here, but in Nolan style with some element of time.
Now lets talk about some pros and cons of this movie.PROS:
Ludwig Göransson. Just great, the trap elements a great and in the final confrontation he outdoes himself.Performances. No one really disappointed, espacially Robert Pattinson gives a good performance. But also John David Washington, Kenneth Branagh,...The experience. You have to watch this movie in cinema. It´s really something else with the good quality sound of IMAX. But also to just really feel it. It keeps you interested and it pushes you into your seat.Hoyte Van Hoytema. Nolan found his whats for Tarantino his Robert Richardson. Big or small images, everything is great and very tense filmed.The airplane scene.CONS:
The whole inversion thing. Like seriously wtf. The whole inversion thing was announced as the biggest thing of the movie and it was just meh. Hard to follow along and pretty boring (not the airplane scene).Characters are boring. The Protagonist gets no story arc, he is like us just there to learn what inversion and TENET is but it isnt very interesting.---
TENET is a great movie with good scenes and good perfomances. It keeps you interested and its funny at the right points. But it lacks and some big plot points and the characters are sometimes just there to explain the plot.
But still a good one, Mr.Nolan.",Tenet
2631,quirkeywriter,"Nolan is novel, but this was overstuffed, outstanding, mesmerizing, unengaging all at the same time.",8,11 December 2020,"Having seen the mixed reception to this movie the world over, I felt this was going to the one Nolan movie that fails. And for the first 40-odd minutes I did feel that way.
Cold, soul-less, exposition-heavy, the scenes briskly cut from one location to another with characters primarily delivering information, which I couldn't give a damn about, to a protagonist, who I couldn't care less about. Even the big plane crash sequence came and went and I was like ""ok, spectacular but that's about it."" But then something happened. A fight sequence involving the protagonist and a time-inverted man. The sheer brilliance of how the inversion concept plays out when taken to the next level beyond objects and bullets was on display in all its visual extravagance. And it was jaw-dropping. Alright then. Game on.
Thereafter the Nolan movie started doing what you expect a Nolan movie to do. Take things you took for granted and project them in a new light so that you see things that you have never seen before. And this time it was the whole world.
The highway car chase scene, a journey into an inverted world, an eye-popping climatic battle scene that hasn't been seen in the history of cinema. No mean feat for any movie. By the end, I wasn't disappointed with what I had seen. I was entertained and happy to a large extent. But I had a lot of thoughts.A constant one I had during the movie was - what if Nolan didn't have this mega budget at his disposal, what if he had just a quarter of it, could he written a better, more engaging, more emotionally absorbing story? Could he have done better with the help of a co-writer (not Jonathan) who could have imbued the movie with some emotional depth? In the book Nolan Variations, he mentioned how Leonardo DiCaprio was the one who pushed him to work on the emotional arc of the tragic love story in Inception, which to me was just a stroke of genius and took the movie several notches higher. That was something I sorely missed in this movie. Despite all its magnificence and brilliance, the movie felt lacking.Tenet seems like a clear choice made by the filmmaker to do away with many things we expect from conventional storytelling. And not all of it works. The movie feels overstuffed, unengaging at times, heavy on exposition and yet stingy in clarity. But nothing takes away from the things that do work - a commitment to novelty, eye-popping visuals, and mesmerizing fight scenes. Hats off to the filmmaker for what he has achieved but it's time for him to refresh, regroup, and reboot.",Tenet

This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels.

It was released in India today, months after the worldwide release, so maybe they have fixed the sound problem that everyone is talking about. It didn't have any such problems in India.
The plot was not at all hollow. It's just that people are focusing too much on the catchy inverse time stuff (which was mind blowing by the way). The plot was deep and it just requires a relaxed mind to catch up. The characters were as deep as they needed to be. This is not a character-driven movie. It is plot-driven. No complaints there. The music was amazing too!
To the haters, I say-
It is a bit heavy on the brain, but why do you have to understand every intricate plot detail then and there in the 2.5 hours runtime? There are too many plot points.

How ever the main hero is idea and execution of the movie. A must watch from Christopher Nolan.,Tenet
2661,tylerfogler-10149,Great story and visually pleasing but confusing?,9,11 December 2020,The movie was a great movie and I would suggest anyone to watch it. I would also suggest watching it twice for the simple fact you won't understand it fully the first time.,Tenet
2662,penguina-55841,"Not interesting, Not Understandable, I don't care",3,27 February 2021,"Seeing as this was by Christopher Nolan, I expected going into this movie to be confused- but I also expected to have my mind-blown and to become fascinated. Unfortunately, I only ended up being bored and uninterested.
The plot is very confusing. You don't get what's happening. This isn't what makes it bad, though. I can watch a confusing movie and bedroll enjoy the movie, but this movie was just boring. I didn't care about the characters or what was happening. It was just a load of meaningless fight scenes and explosions with no understandable context. By the last hour, I had enough and skipped through it to the end.",Tenet
2663,manlin-99322,Amazing Action,9,13 January 2021,"I was really looking forward to this film, and it did not disappoint. Although the story was a bit confusing or hard to follow at times, overall it was really creative and definitely full of incredible action. Excellent acting as well.",Tenet

2665,broadway_03,Absolutely no plot!!,1,13 May 2021,"This movie is shot beautifully and the actors do a great job with what they've been given. However, the story tries a little misdirection, if we distract them with a confusing concept of reverse entropy sent back through time, maybe they will ignore the gaping plot holes.Spoiler alert: the Russian is trying to end the world because he's dying. Fine. But who in the future would have a vested interest in helping him do that? How do they know where he's burying these munition dumps? Clearly it's not himself in the future because he's dying, remember? The only Easter egg you're given is that the protagonist recruits Neil in his future, Neil's past. But what motivation would he have to help the Russian? If it is him, why did he sent Neil to help stop the Russian? I can't imagine a scenario where that would be the case.The other big issue is that the technology was invented in the future. Makes sense. In the same future they have also invented time travel, but only for objects. Going off the rails a bit, but ok. At no time did a future good guy think to send written instructions to help stop the bad guys? How is future protagonist communicating with Neil? How does either technology work?A lot of these reviews talk about having to watch it again. Sure there are some hints that Neil helps out in the opera house or that the protagonist is fighting himself at the airport. But none of that fills in any of these holes in the story. And I'm not going to spend another 2.5 hours on foreshadowing, I want explanations!If this were a cop show the Russian would be a street dealer and the future person would be the supplier. What satisfaction would there be if the movie ended after taking out the spiteful meth dealer? Very little. You want to know who's producing the meth, their method of cooking fancy new meth and how it's being distributed.I'm usually a big Chris Nolan fan, but this was a big swing and a miss.",Tenet
2666,ering-20773,Difficult to understand,8,8 June 2021,"I had to watch this film twice to get a grip of the story line and even then i was still left puzzled. The confusing factor of the movie may draw people away from it as it was a widely spread opinion amongst everyone. However, for me, I am intrigued by it. I am attracted to the difficult plot line as it makes the movie more interesting to watch as no matter how many times you watch it it wont get boring. It certainly isn't a predictable movie and the plot was very well thought out, I think that deserves more recognition than just brushing the movie off as confusing. This movie is made to be watched, not just as a noise filler in the background.",Tenet

2669,xandervergucht,Modern day masterpiece,9,2 October 2021,"If people would actually think for a second whilst watching this movie, they'd understand it's beauty. It's been a year and i still haven't recovered from this modern day masterpiece. Nolan is truly the best there is.",Tenet
2670,nm3160113,Awful,2,27 August 2020,"Has Christopher Nolan lost it? This is the first Nolan film I actually dislike and im usually a big fan of his. Inception is one of my fav films of all time so I went into this thinking I would at least enjoy elements of it. I didn't. The concept is no where near as enticing as Inception and the execution was very poor.It had no redeeming features either as apart from Pattinson (who was quite good) the performances lacked conviction, the action was very dull and all the plot was told during lengthy dialogue sequences where the characters explain everything to each other. Music sounded like a parody of itself and the world in which all this takes place was dull and lacked a sense of place. Nothing felt real.It felt like Nolan really wanted to make a James Bond film and threw in the backwards bullets to give a sci-fi twist. Unfortunately he does not seem to know what makes Bond work and all we get is his lifeless characters and environments mixed with a science lecture. I'm not surprised he hasn't been given an actual Bond film of his own to make if this is what he pitched.",Tenet
2671,cjgarrett-1,Disappointing and slightly predictable,6,8 September 2020,"Haven't been to a movie theater in six months and it felt good to be back. Christopher Nolan returns with another globe trotting thriller. Like Inception he tries again to be innovative and clever although instead of dreams, he focuses on time travel, sort of. The film was neither easy to follow or compelling; it felt tedious most of the way through. The empty and unbelievable characters didn't help either me care either. While I do enjoy the talents of John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, I felt that they were miscast. Fortunately Tenet redeems itself with a decent ending, good action scenes, and a very thrilling score. I will definitely give it a rewatch.",Tenet
2672,onewayforanother,Mezmerizing action scenes but suffers from weak dialogue and shallow characters,6,31 August 2020,"This is an entertaining movie, albeit it's a tad too long. I really enjoyed the action scenes as the were well made and fascinating. But thats about it. The story is ok. It's very complex, and I don't know, if I understood it all. Maybe a aecond viewing could provide some answers, but the movie wasn't really good enough for me, so that I would watch it again. Cause honestly, I don't really care for the answers.The characters had zero developent and you never really cared for any of them. The Protagonist had some preferences and made some choices, that wasn't very logical. Without saying too much, I often wondered why he would value certain things under these circumstances.The movie had zero charm. At one scene the protagonist try to makes some jokes, which could have been funny in another context. But Because the movie takes itself so serious the comic attempt fell to the floor as it just felt misplaced.Also, regarding the dialogue I felt like I was watching my kids lego ninjago series. A lot of the lines were said in this epic manner. ""We must save the world before it's too late!""So I never really figured out was this movie wanted to be. And I guess I won't as I won't be watching it again.But please watch it in the cinema as the action deserves that.",Tenet
2673,mark-4037,"Time travel, eh",6,22 August 2020,"Good film, worth seeing, but unlike other time bending films such as Inception, nothing in Tenet really caught my imagination enough to want to sit through again so that I could fully follow all the intricacies of the time travel plot.
It's a bit confusing (certainly the first half, the second half clears a few things up), there are a couple of big stunts, but the lead actors are not very engaging. I didn't really care about any of them and they didn't really seem to care about each other. All a bit stilted in the end. I also didn't really care about the end of the world, which is probably a bigger issue.
The grandfather paradox (if I travel back in time and kill my grandfather how can I exist to go back in time etc.) is mentioned, but sort of waved away with a 'it is what it is / who knows what will happen? shrug of the shoulders. But as everything that happens in the past in the film is clearly seen in the present, when the end of the world turns out to have been planned to occur a few weeks ago, it sort of means it probably didn't happen, then and we should all stop worrying.
The other issue was the sound quality. A reasonable amount of the film is done with the leads wearing masks. This makes for muffled speech to the extent that I couldn't understand some bits. And it doesn't help when strong Russian accents are attempted and spoken with a time reversed echo. I pretty much lost that entire scene.
So, meh, it's no Dark Knight.",Tenet
2674,ITS_SHOWTIME37,An Absolute Casserole of Stupendous Nonsense,1,27 August 2020,"Yesterday afternoon, I went to the local Cinema to watch Tenet. While the majority of the plot was kept very secretive, I knew that it was a science fiction thriller about time travel and something to do with preventing WW3 from the trailers. The presence of my favourite Indian Actress Dimple Kapadia was also somewhat of a pleasant surprise and having seen Christopher Nolan's previous work and having mixed reactions (for the record I hated Interstellar) I decided to give the film a chance.At a staggering runtime of 150 minutes, I found the film to be overlong, boring and rather tedious. While the trio of Washington, Pattison (who I look forward to seeing in The Batman) and Debicki, were rather good and showed great potential for future films, I was left very dissapointed with the storyline, the plot and unnecessarily complex structure which no doubt would have left many viewers confused. I did not appreciate the fact that the film gave a very anti Russian stance throughout. The references to the Tolstoy/Pugachev affair were totally unnecessary, hypocritical and used merely to paint Russian oligarchs in a bad light. Combined with the sudden shifts in jumping forward and backwards in time the film be and unwatchable.When we actually learn what the movie is about (not WW3 but rather environmental hysteria), then we also realise why the studios were not keen to reveal this to the audience as sane, reasonable people who use logic would have refused to see it. I myself walked out of the cinema in sheer disgust with 30 minutes of the film remaining, something that I have never done before. This film could easily have been a top class heist movie but they ruined it by taking it into the left wing direction that they went with.Christopher Nolan has lost alot of credibility as a director in my eyes. And I myself have always found him to be overrated. When Christopher Nolan made the second and third Batman films, he was asked about the speculation regarding the villains that would appear in those movies. What he did did was stick with the villains that we have seen for the last few decades. So once again we saw Batman vs the Joker. Not only that, he quiet snobbishly said that the Penguin, Mr Freeze and the Riddler would not have any place in his universe and difficult to interpret in a serious film. This is of course something that he was proved totally wrong with when we saw all 3 characters portrayed brilliantly in Gotham. And had Heath Ledger not passed away, then the The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises would have followed pretty much the same plot as the Frank Miller comic book 'The Dark Knight Returns'. To me that shows that he's a sub par director who just likes to stick with what has been done in the past and repeat it. Heath ledger's joker character was basically portrayed previously in the form of Tyler Durden from Fight Club. There was nothing new or special about that character, even though I liked Ledger's performance.I am also disgusted at mainstream film reviewers giving Christopher Nolan good reviews even though his films are sub par and quite simply unwatchable. And yet these reviewers were simply heaping praise on him because his name was in the credits.If you really want to see an intellectual and well thought out movie about time travel, don't waste your money on the overly long and boring Tenet. Instead, watch the Alex Garland TV series DEVS, which is without a shadow of a doubt a work of genius.",Tenet

The more I think about it, the more I make sense of each plot detail, the more I love it.Finally, we have a summer blockbuster that doesn't cater to a specific audience. After years of trudging through Marvel, Michael Bay, or Disney simply trying to appease or get by, we get a truly challenging and exciting movie going experience. Sure, stuff blows up, but Nolan, unlike his competitors, forces us to pay attention. He forces us to be engaged.And trust me, we'll be rewarded for it.The plot is simple enough, until it isn't. It's a James Bond story: a secret agent must stop a selfish foreign enemy from destroying the world by getting close to his hot wife. But there's a catch: time runs backwards sometimes. And it's one of the most original, well thought out concepts I've ever seenThe concept is explained well enough but following each character through the timeline, while also trying to keep up with the plot, is difficult. But afterwards, if you sit down, discuss it, make sense of it, things become clearer. That's when your eyes go wide again. That's when you gasp AGAIN. You already did when you watched it in the cinema. But when you understand it and you want to understand more and when you want to go back and see it again-you know the director has done their job.I love this movie. It challenged me in the audience while also delivering the thrills I expect from a summer blockbuster. It absolutely restored my faith in high budget moviemaking once again. It's exciting, new, and very complex. I can't wait to see it again.",Tenet

2681,james_sex09,People just lack the intellectual depth to understand it in one go,10,6 December 2020,"Nolan once said in an interview that he was jealous of the freedom that those in the fields of literature have enjoyed in the past and 'we do not have those freedoms as a filmmaker'. This film does more than what any literature could have ever done. Rating this 7.7 and Inception 8.8 just shows how convinient it is to accept a simple but innvoative story such as Inception to be great, but not Tenet which challenges your intellectual capability.Never heard before concepts that Nolan introduces in the film are Inversion of objects and people, temporal pincer movement, shooting fighting sequences from two different perspectives of time - one in reverse and one linear. Nolan uses every trick of filmmaking to give himeself the freedom that the literary folks enjoy without having to execute their ideas in reality.Someone wrote that this film would have been thrown away after 10 pages by any producer if it was not Nolan's. He is probably right but it is just because you cannot see this film in a script. It is one of those films that can only be expressed in the form of a film, not a novel or a comic,Now coming to the cast of the film, it was such a brave move to cast John David Washington in a seemingly Bond-type movie, when the Bond franchisee itself has been reluctant to cast any African American. He conviniently didn't use any of his past characters except for Sir Michael Caine who is basically a totem of Nolan's world. Even the antagonist, who is not like the Joker or Bane, has acted well enough as a misogynistic vengeful chap.Overall, if you think this film needs a one more go or some reading on it, then do it. I am pretty sure even though Prestige looked pretty simple to you, if you haven't watched it more than once, you haven't got it yet.",Tenet

I actually felt like leaving halfway it was so pretentiously 'clever.' It would have made a decent time-heist film without all this 'inversion' BS which if we're honest, was a blunt contrivance to allow for cool looking backwards effects.

I absolutely love a lot of Chris Nolan's previous works, including The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Dunkirk. I am stunned by his ability to create real-looking special effects in a Hollywood filled with digital ""moving paintings"". I love the thought that he puts into his movies, and I feel that the movies I just outlined above are some of the finest movies ever made in Hollywood history.This film, however, was a pretentious joke. It was populated by cardboard characters that were dull and un-interesting. The dialog, so important to the plot, was unintelligible for 99% of the movie. You literally couldn't hear it. Let me restate that, just so I am clear: I tune pianos. I can hear a pin drop a mile away. I couldn't hear the dialog over the background noise and the idiotic, screeching score of The Mandalorian playing over a Chris Nolan movie with the volume knob turned up too far. About 10 minutes in, I had to turn on the subtitles to read what was being said so I could understand it, and I was forced to leave them on for the rest of the film.Many of the flaws in this film also plagued another ""smart"" movie by Nolan, Interstellar. In short, both of these films tried to be so smart that they ended up being stupid.As the end credits rolled on this film, I wished that I could get into one of those turnstiles, go back, and warn my younger self not to bother wasting my afternoon. But then I might have seen older self jumping off a yacht and thought something was amiss. Maybe the world would have ended, I don't know. And frankly, I have ceased to care.Let me be clear: It's not that I'm too ""dumb"" to understand the movie. It's that I literally don't care enough to watch it enough times to try to tie up the loose ends in my head. Watching a movie multiple times to get details out of it is great; but by the time the credits roll the first time through, you should at least be able to understand and explain the basic plot, and have a warm and fuzzy feeling about it.I have no such sense of fulfillment. Indeed, I am hopping mad. I have heard other people say that they felt inexplicably angry as they watched this film, and thought such statements were bizarre and overstated. Yet I sit here now, and quite honestly, I feel the same way. Worse yet, I am not even sure why. Perhaps it is because I felt the movie insulted my intelligence. Perhaps it's because I suspect Nolan made a movie that was actually intended as a practical joke to make other people think the film was super-smart when it was actually purposefully stupid, and to laugh at people trying to say how smart it was. One way or another, I am irritated.As a side note: One interesting effect of watching things play out in both forward and reverse directions on my screen simultaneously is that I actually feel dizzy now. Physically dizzy. I am not one prone to disorientation or seizures from flashing lights, and I even enjoy watching ""reverse"" scenes in some other films. But right now, I literally feel like something on my head is spinning in the wrong direction now. This movie may be hazardous to your mental and physical health.Other people may enjoy the film and think that it is ""smart"". Fine, good for you. Personally, I would give a bar of gold to have those two and a half hours of my life back.",Tenet

I teach science and have a fairly decent grasp of the laws of thermodynamics, but this was way too complicated. The sound was terrible and by the end I had forgotten certain key points about the algorithm that wrapped the film up (mainly how the algorithm brought about the end of the world and needed to be buried - still non- plussed). You shouldn't need a notebook in a film. I think that the poor sound quality, length and unnecessary complicated plot are designed for people to watch it a second time...?

2708,Dangermouse0,Disappointing,3,13 September 2020,"I was eager to see Tenet, as I appreciate the excellent films in Christopher Nolan's oeuvre. This endeavor is not up to par.The writing is not very good. It is quite ambitious and over-complicated. The dialogue is rather difficult to hear and thus, understand.The acting is stilted, limited in range, and lacks chemistry. Often times it seems the actors are merely repeating lines to one another rather than embodying the characters and genuinely engaging each other. I think I understand why; the complexity of the script must have been challenging to recall, let alone to believe it and own it. Robert Pattinson may bring the most life to his character, yet is still hit and miss. Ultimately, however, poor acting rests on the shoulders of the director.There are some bad edits that leave the flow choppy and in lack of continuity and coherence.The finale sequence is the most interesting and entertaining part of the movie, then Pattinson and Washington kill the vibe by explaining the plot to each other in yet more painfully stilted, and somewhat obvious, dialogue.There is much to unpack and the coding and puzzles are not lost on me, it just doesn't seem to be well executed.I had high hopes but am ultimately disappointed.",Tenet
2709,ironmonkeypimp,silly film,1,9 December 2020,"Time inversion was silly. Red Dwarf did it better many years ago. However watching this film , one thing was clear: Robert Pattinson will play James Bond one day and he will be awesome. I didn't even like Robert Pattinson before this. But yeah Robert Pattinson good, film was garbage.",Tenet
2710,oagill1,AMAZING JOURNEY IN A TIME WARP,9,27 August 2020,"The first genuine blockbuster since the COVID lockdown has arrived and I managed to catch one of the many preview screenings on Sunday night and quite frankly I departed in a state of astonishment.
It's yet another epic from visionary Director Christopher Nolan, who had been grappling with this concept for around ten years, before production began in 2019. There had been much secrecy surrounding his project, including a teaser trailer which gave a mere sprinkling of an espionage drama with some time manipulating twists. Tenet abounds with the unique styles of Nolan's filmmaking, especially with similarities to ""Inception"" and it's time bending concepts, plus ""Interstellar"" which was driven by its loud and dominant soundtrack and also ""Dunkirk"" which leapt straight into action, without any character development.
It starts off and progresses very much like a Bond spy film, with an unnamed CIA operative known as The Protagonist (BlacKkKlansman's David John Washington), recruited by a mysterious organisation called Tenet, after he impressively thwarted a Ukrainian terrorist kidnapping plot. (Mind you this was filmed on a grand scale with a massive crowd of extras). But the mission now at hand, is to prevent the rich and wealthy renegade Russian Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) from starting WWIII, by not only stopping his use of a plutonium bomb but also impede the use of ""time inversion"" to plant it. This mind bending concept is where events of time run backwards. The Protagonist is briefly trained in aspects of time inversion before embarking on his journey and it is at this point that cinema goers get an opportunity to get their head around this dizzying notion. He is joined by a resourceful offsider who has all the great ideas (Twilight's Robert Pattinson) and early on we also meet Sator's wife (Aussie Elizabeth Debicki), who ends up the linchpin for both sides. The second half of the film is astounding movie making and as hinted in the trailer, has the action scenes running simultaneously, both forward and backward in time. When time intersects, the whole story inverts and is then viewed from the opposite perspective. It is by seeing action from a different viewpoint that helps piece together a puzzling story. However, putting this kind of conceptual script into moving pictures is something probably never attempted, but is achieved with such a damn stunning result.
Thankfully the cast all lifted their game to a high standard so as to compliment Nolan's most ambitious project to date.
Our Director spares no expense with locations employed in 7 countries, and set pieces built on a huge scale. An enormous luxury motor cruiser was hired as were giant catamarans from the SailGP series. (The aerial cinematography around these cats was special). And in one scene Nolan needed to build an airport set to crash a real jumbo jet into. How audacious can one get? Nolan likes the real thing and relies almost entirely on physical effects over CG creations, including when things go boom!
And the soundtrack (which was not Hans Zimmer this time), along with the soundmixer ensured the cinema rocked and vibrated like never before. The downside to this was some difficulty picking up certain dialogue (like in Interstellar). But who cares, the vision reveals many answers and was bold, brash and bonkers, and so perfect for the big screen. Described in one word....Phew!!",Tenet
2711,katstephens32,Amazing movie,10,22 May 2021,From start to finish amazing. Amazing acting. I usually can't stand Robert Pattinson but this movie is awesome. Writing was beyond good.

Why, why couldn't they think of a better way to do this movie?Sometimes, innovation goes too far. Movies exist to serve us with a story in an entertaining way. They are means to an end. Not this movie. Here, it seems that creating a complex movie was the goal, and the plot was just used up and spit out, so much that despite being pretty long, I was left fumbled, asking myself what did I just witness.Sometimes there are simple movies with simple plot that do a great job delivering it. This is the opposite of those movies.

2718,radmehr_radi,Don't try to understand it feel it!,9,28 August 2020,"Tenet is the latest Christopher Nolan film starring John David Washington, Elizabeth debicki, Robert Pattinson and keneneth Branagh.
I can't and I don't know how to explain the story. it's a movie that you have to watch it at least twice and I'm going to rewatch it this week. All I can tell you is this is an awesome well made spy/sci-fi movie that you've never seen. Just watch the trailer and go to your local theater.
The first thing that got my attention into the movie was the music oh my god! The music score of this film is incredible. It's an instance film every action moment is instance! but as soon as music starts you're into the movie and this time ludwig goranssson did the soundtrack who also did black panther and won an Oscar for that and also did a few more movies soundtrack and this was his best one imo. The casting choice and acting is great but the Characterizations is a little bit weak not just this film almost the most of the Christopher Nolan films characters I don't care about them Me and the most of the audiences mostly care about the storyline and the things are happening during the movie. Most of his characters are like video games characters and the audiences are the gamers so to watch and understand his movies you have to use your brain as your gaming controller imo. I love the fact that Nolan always avoid green screen and try to use practical effects and that makes the cast performances and action scenes 100 times better and real. And that's why this was by far my best cinematic experience in a movie theater I felt like I was in the movie. Overall it's an awesome well made film that is totally worth watching and paying in cinemas even twice! It's complicating it's crazy and that was everything I wanted from a Nolan film even more what I was expecting! This is one of his best works for the past decade and also one of the best movies of 2020 and this decade. I liked this more than inception. My score for tenet will be a 9/10 for now I may change my mind after second or multiple viewing.",Tenet

2720,commodore14,Christopher Nolans masterpiece,10,23 August 2020,"First off wow!.... I literally have to pause myself to describe into words of how incredible and amazing this piece of artwork of a film was by Christopher Nolan...Also if you see a bad review about this movie which I've already started to see not on IMDB, absolutely forget it and them. They don't have shed of intelligence or a slight understanding or comprehension of what this movie was about.Next off, I'm placing this movie into a category of best movies of this decade so far. Absolutely loved it to pieces. I had been waiting all week since I booked my advance screening tickets to it and had been waiting alllll these years since the filming went into production with Nolans name at the helm. It was insanely better than what I thought in my mind of what it could be about when the first trailer popped up.It was a shame to not see Hans Zimmer on the production credits for music score, but the score was definitely well done and probably a tributary tracking in certain scenes towards Zimmer by Ludwig. Really loved it. Especially the action scenes enveloping these beautiful melodies. I very much felt like Zimmer would be happy with a score like this.The movies main concept and idea is just absolutely incredible. Nolan hit it completely out of the gates on this one like he always does. It's like one of those movies where you go ""Wow no one hasn't particularly used this type of cinematography or storyline based around time travel"". Same with Inceptions core of understanding with dreams and how he filmed that movie with a whole new concept and idea. I'd say this movie was very much like Inception, but in a Time diverse way if that makes sense.I won't give away too much details around the main concept as that would spoil major key details that weren't shown in the trailers. But I have to say the opening scene was absolutely insane, like the Joker scenes at the bank heist opening scenes insane. Really well thought out, especially when the end credits roll and you totally suck the whole scope and understanding of the movie up into your mind from the very first scenes like ""Omg wow! that's why that happened"". Like you're totally trying to work it all out, but it becomes absolutely clear in the end.I am definitely going to see this movie a hundred more times, especially when it comes to Blu-ray release. Just to pick up more of the hidden easter eggs going on in the background when you're focused on some scenes. It would have been absolutely insane filming that ending via the use of scene tiles in pre production. I am guessing that department must have been a nightmare to shoot with Nolan choreographing thousands of graphic picture tiles up on the board, linking up both stories of the movie. I cannot wait to hit play on the behind the scenes when I get the Blu-ray release.Who ever was the theoretical physicist on this film working with Nolan. Which I am guessing is Kip Thorne, going by his work on Interstellars script. And definitely his knowledge on Entropy and Time dilation physics. My hat is off to you my good Sir. You smashed the physics out of the ball park with Nolans creativity concept of a storyline to go with it. Absolutely incredible.I hate saying this, but I have to say this is Nolans best work he's ever done to date. Like I absolutely loved Inception and Interstellar to pieces but the script of this movie is just hands down incredible and creativity towards it, developing this idea of time travel flow takes the top position over Interstellar and Inception. Especially by the use of CGI and filming. Hard to say this, but because Zimmer wasn't involved. It's kind of easy to understand that I can say this in my mind. The last Christopher Nolan film that had me smiling the whole entire time was Interstellar, but this one had me doing the same exact thing. It's just a masterpiece.This film when it finally releases all around the world and everyone has seen it, will be definitely talking about it. Especially the ending. I was like ""This was absolutely beautifully interwoven from the get go"".Also before I end this review. I have to give credit to Robert Pattison. He played a really different roll to what he normally plays and can definitely see him as Batman coming out of this movie. I have a feeling he might do actually well with that. I also liked Denzel Washingtons son John David Washington from Ballers in this too.",Tenet

I can't make much sense of what's happening in backwards. Maybe it's me. Maybe this film is ahead of my time. Maybe ahead of our time.

2. Why would our protagonist try to shoot himself in the head during the scene where one is in black military outfit and the other in the fancy suit.
3. The movie establish a rule that in order to survive inversion, you must wear a safety mask for breathing (unless your in a fancy container). Fair enough, but several times this rule is broken. Kat is inverted and is back on the yacht, she doesn't wear a mask at any point.
4. Inverted people and non-inverted people experience each other differently. So why is Kat not spotted by Andrei back on the yacht? she would be moving in visibly different ways compared to Andrei.Interesting idea with inversion and time travel, but I don't like when the movie break its own set of rules then it just becomes a bad movie.",Tenet

It's not as convoluted as some of the other Nolan's film, as long as you comprehend the premise. The twist in the fabric of reality the action is based on is quite straightforward and it all makes sense as long as you buy into the logic he proposes.
But that aside the film is absolutely stunning, the plethora of top class actors are giving their best performances and the music is a vital element of the action, adding a whole new level of experience and meaning to the story.

2737,CornelisdeVos,"Pretentious, disjointed and not very engaging",6,5 December 2020,"I usually enjoy the work of Christopher Nolan, albeit not a die-hard fan like some people.I get it, this film is complex and puzzle-like, and probably best enjoyed with a couple viewings or more. But since the story feels so disjointed I couldn't really get a feel for any of the characters until perhaps at the very end, if that even.I usually have an issue with time travel (or time going backwards in this case, potatoes tomatoes) in stories because it's quite impossible to get it right. Too many unanswered questions in the science of it all and too many aspects of it just not making any sense whatsoever. Sure, all things doesn't have to be explained in minutiae. I like sci-fi and it doesn't always have to make perfect sense. But it all gets a bit more difficult when the only thing that carries you through the story is the fact that you're trying to make sense of it, at all.Questions to ponder: if they're moving backwards in time, wouldn't each and every motion be backwards? Why don't they speak in reverse? Furthermore, how do you isolate your own body from the world around you? What is it even with us humans and wanting to think of ourselves as separate from the world around us? Does the bacteria in the protagonists bowels live in reverse too? How would that affect his metabolism? If breathing can't be done without damaging the lungs, what wouldn't sweating be like? What about causality? What's these nuclear materials got to do with anything? Why would they cause causality to start going backwards? I guess theoretically the world COULD be inverted, but certainly not just separate parts of it. Everything ties together. Plus, as we all know, the past and the future is just a human concept. There is only now, always.That, and so much more, was basically my internal dialogue throughout this film, and it didn't help that I didn't care much for the people in it so there was nothing to steal my focus away from just questioning everything.I'm not a physicist but all of this just seems so implausible, when at the same time it tries so hard to make sense and paint a coherent picture, and that I think, is my biggest gripe. I can watch superheroes all day and not question a thing, but they're rarely this pretentious.There's nothing wrong with just telling a great story in a good way. I wish more directors felt this.6/10, and that's mainly because of the special effects and the fact that they manage to sew this plot together at all.",Tenet
2738,ross-herbert8,Not accessible,6,28 January 2021,"I watched this, I tried my hardest to understand as I went through, I concentrated, but it's impossible to follow. You know Nolan had this idea in his head for 20 years? You know it took him five years to write it? Yet we're meant to understand everything in 45 minutes of dreary exposition (yes, for the most part of the first part of the film is just someone explaining what Tenet is and people walking and talking. A common trait of Nolan's, he's never been the best at visual storytelling, always needs tonnes of exposition). Anyone that says they understood this film, especially after only one watch, is only lying to themselves. I suppose you can get the general gist of how Tenet works, but with this kind-of understanding you get, comes along with, you guessed it, the SAME plot we've seen 1,000,000 times before! American's save world from generic evil Russian villain trying to blow it up! The characters are dreadful as well, maybe apart from Elizabeth Debicki's character. The acting is good, I like John David Washington and I like Robert Pattinson, they did their best and were actually quite good with what was a dull, bland screenplay.And the end of the day though I could still kind of get the gist of what was going on, enough to partially enjoy the film. Stunning visuals, fight scenes with one person going forward and one person in reverse, a building blowing up and being rebuilt at the same time, absolutely amazing visuals. Good action and as I say, good acting, but I can't look past the dull writing and painfully generic storyline. It's way too hard to understand what they're talking about most of the time, making the film very inaccessible for most people.",Tenet

So what the audience gets is unbelievably cheesy writing, poor sound mixing, and no character development or history to make one care about anything.

2746,venimusrex,My least favorite Nolan film,6,30 May 2021,"I just traveled back in time to tell you not to waste yours watching ""Tenet"". I can tell the filmmakers intended it to be so complex as to invite multiple viewings; but for me, this had the ""inverse"" effect (plot-related pun). I never want to watch it again. It's not just the convoluted concept and disorienting visuals that are confusing, but I couldn't understand much of the dialogue because the actors were mumbling and barely moving their mouths quite a lot! The only enjoyment I got from it was laughing at how seriously it took itself, and how I couldn't understand what was being said at key parts. I could only tell that they were saying it very seriously! It doesn't help that the main theme is time travel, which is an inherently distorted and misunderstood idea. Time is only real as a relative experience, but does not actually exist in a universal sense.Like everything though, ""Tenet"" is an interpretation or reflection of reality. For some who aren't aware, investigating covert projects like ""Looking Glass"" and ""Montauk"" will be a gateway to further discovery. Though time is not concrete or linear as many believe, there are ""time corps"", or people who attempt to police various parallel realities. That's really what everything is: simultaneously existing parallel realities, or infinite nows. In other words, everything exists in infinitely varied energy frequencies which are constantly changing, shifting, cycling, evolving. Some interpret this change as time, but there are frequencies or states of consciousness where time is simply an illusion, and isn't real. If you understand that, then this movie doesn't make much sense; and if you don't understand that, it still doesn't make much sense!For example, a bomb is ultimately the main threat in the movie, but they fail to adequately explain how a seemingly conventional explosive is supposed to somehow destroy all of existence. (If I'm misinterpreting that being the case, then again this is a failure of the film for not clarifying what is actually going on.) If the main antagonist is not believable or perceived as an actual threat, that completely deflates any dramatic tension, plausibility, or interest in the story. In other words, a bomb is a rather weak, lazy, and uninspired plot device for a movie that is supposed to be so ""intellectual"".",Tenet

Sounds powerful and it is to a point; but what would have helped me get more emotionally involved in the movie is if the small scale human-level direct and indirect effects would have been inter-woven with the bigger plot driver around saving the world.

This movie is a lot like Mementos which requires multiple re-watch to assemble all the puzzle pieces together.First off, this movie isn't meant to be an 'acting' magnum opus. The actors all do a fine job, but it's obvious this movie wasn't needing method actors like Christian Bales, Joaquin Phoenix, Matthew McConaughey, etc. The brilliance of the movie resides in the concept itself. It's hard to review the movie without ruining it with spoilers, so I'll leave it at that. Just remember that it needs more than one watch. I give it 9/10 because at the end you need to pay twice for the movie...I'm a huge fan of time-travel stories, especially the ones involving time paradox concepts. One that come to mind is a smart time-travel novella I've read around March titled Project Dechentreiter (2015) by Elder Prince. I couldn't understand the story from one-time reading, my mind was in torment even though there were so many clues and puzzle pieces hidden in plain sight. Everything made so much sense after a second read (luckily the story only counts 80 pages), and what a fantastic e-book that I highly recommend. There was also a movie called Time Lapse (2014), that one included brilliant ideas but wasn't executed with elegance, but is a good watch anyway.I can't wait for Christopher Nolan's next movie!",Tenet

The entire movie reminded me of academics who aim for superiority by using an excessive amount of jargon and a 'unique' structure, but in reality are just bad at presenting ideas to a learning audience. The movie isn't as smart as it thinks it is, and while it's certainly pretty, it's boring. Action and an interesting hook can only carry a narrative so far, and we're given no reason to care for the main cast beside their familiar faces and some weak 'family' connections that are never developed.Additionally, the 'epic' score is used excessively throughout, sometimes making it difficult to hear the actual dialogue.

People are getting smarter, but just because a movie isn't easy to follow along while playing on your phone doesn't make the movie bad.Christopher Nolan delivers a new concept for a movie. Something that hasn't been done before and is exciting, but because the movie isn't easy to understand does not make the movie difficult.The movie does a great job with scenes alone. The action is amazing and each scene is shot to perfection. The movie has you wondering what is happening but step by step allows you to understand more of its own concepts.The only thing I found the movie to be lacking is character development, which in a movie like this is extremely difficult because you are preoccupied with understanding what is happening.

Sound mixing that will give you a headache for hours and leave you wishing subtitles were standard as you've missed large chunks of dialog because of it, a story with little to no personal stakes for any of the characters, very disappointingly falling into the James Bond problem that it's highly unlikely your film is going to end with the world actually ending.A frequent theme of the great Nolan films were not just the over arching need to save the world stakes but a personal goal for our protagonists to achieve, Bruce Wayne to save Gotham and make it out alive, Cobb to return to his children, Cooper to make it back to Murph, some failed, some succeeded, some left open to interpretation. Tenet lacks any of these stakes leaving you no doubt that by the time you've come full circle on the story, and yes the story is a circle in shape, the protagonists will have succeeded.I have no doubt this film will age to better reviews upon repeat viewings, but as a one off experience I didn't get anywhere near the satisfaction as that from previous instalments of the Nolanverse.",Tenet

Didn't think Nolan could make a bad film but this was rubbish. Complicated storyline that wasn't interesting enough for me to want to watch it again to try and understand. It felt like half a film stitched together in the wrong order. Inception was a masterpiece of originality, incredible cast, great story and one you'd need to watch a couple of times to fully appreciate its mastery. This definitely fell well short of that. Seems to be the trend at the moment for trying to over complicate film making and focus on being too clever and original rather than concentrating on just good story telling. Didn't have a clue what was going on half the time throughout this film which just made it boring and uninteresting. The sound seemed a little off too but maybe it was just some of the complexity of the dialogue and fast delivery that made it hard to keep up? It seemed like there was a lot of exposition to try and explain the film but it was so poorly timed or delivered, that it didn't allow you to really grasp the concept well enough to buy into the story. Thought it was really badly cast too. Didn't buy the lead guy for a second and although Robert pattinson was okay, he definitely wasn't up to the standard of a normal Nolan movie. The actor playing the soldier was possibly the worst out of the bunch. Total cheese ball and very unconvincing, I thought he was an extra who'd been given a couple of lines until he actually developed into a relatively big character. Action was well shot as you'd expect which was in fact the only reason I stayed until the end. Definitely wouldn't recommend it but like people have said, it is a spectacle.",Tenet

Unless you see it from the perspective of the creator, it's an unclear mess. Christopher Nolan is my favourite director, but he clearly missed the mark with this one.

This movie started with a great heist sequence at a stadium followed by the real timeline, just the way Inception had that sequence in its beginning. The entire movie fell apart from there on. The idea of non-linear time is refreshing but Nolan did so little to show its implications. Since Tenet is an action movie, I was anticipating top notch mechanics with non-linear time and weapons. In the end it turned out to be exactly what Zack Snyder's did to Batman v Superman (2016). There was no emotional setting here in this movie maybe due to lack of character development of lead actress. There are several other problems with the movie but what disappoints me most is the philosophical aspect which you usually take from a Nolan movie. This movie lacks depth and does not capture the viewers.

Forget that there should be an extremely subtle meaning to the 2h30 running time and the exorbitant production cost. There isn't, really.So... ""Why so serious?"" Nolan might ask.

Nolan wants to feel smart by writing an incomrehensible story that only he understands. The directing is great in general, although I did get a bit annoyed after a while by the constant jumping between places (if that is part of the directing i dunno whatever). And the name dropping and little tidbits of sciency factoids is kind of silly as well.

Here is a trick, put down your cellphone and pay attention. I agree that it is complex but you just need to pay attention or it will be very confusing. If you miss 2 minutes of the movie, you'll be lost (keep your eyes on the screen). Dialogue only becomes an issue when they were wearing the masks. But hey, no one understands what I say when I go to the store wearing a mask during COVID-19 (reality I guess). Robert did an amazing job in a very mysterious character. John-David is awesome as the lead and keeps reminding me of his dad, not sure this is a good thing (got big shoes to fill). Overall John David did really well and learning that he did most of his stunts was an added bonus. My first like-able Nolan female character (she can act).

2809,antnelson,Disappointed,1,4 September 2020,"After years of watching Nolan films, and being a big fan, the anticipation of this film was increased by the delay to its release. Finally I was able to sit and watch it, in an empty cinema, and I have to say it was a total and utter flop for me.The film feels like a series of confusing and chaotic set pieces, muddled together; entwined with a god awful din of a soundtrack. Nestled amongst these set pieces are a group of characters who just dont inspire any sort of feeling or emotion. 2/3 of the way through, I didnt really care what happened to any of them. And actually, you start to think, any of them could die, and they just rewind time and do it again. And when they do, it would be greeted with a massive fog horn that bellows out so you dont understand a word anyway.The viewer is thrown into a world with no explanation, no back stories or emotional involvement. Just instant booming, muttering and over editing. The story is simple, it centre's around a lover scorned, who wants to end the world so no one else can touch his wife. Our heroes scramble around, going back and forth in time to try and stop him collecting the final infinity stone, oh sorry, wrong film. But similar premises.I think maybe its just that i didnt connect. Fair play to Nolan as usual for not conforming to the norm, but it just feels like a film trying to be overly complicated for the sake of it.I spoke to the attendant on the way out and he asked if I enjoyed it. I said no, and that it was so disappointing. He suggested I watch it again as apparently its ""better the second time"". I think I will pass on that one.",Tenet

2814,spencermcook,Built For Long Term Curiosity,9,15 September 2020,"Trying to take my bias opinion away from my critical, logical opinion. Few people comprehend the immense detail with the story, I don't even comprehend all of it, but now I understand enough to believe that this is Nolan's most elaborate story yet. This is a complicated movie, and complicated in a good way. If you (as an audience) don't enjoy or understand this movie I understand why and I don't blame you, but on the contrary if you do enjoy this movie, if you understand the story, then I understand why you may believe this to be one of the most intelligent films of all time. (BOLD claim). We already knew what to expect with the quality of cinematography, visual, score, and even to a certain extent, the wild plot that Christopher Nolan ALWAYS delivers because he's consistent with all his films. What we received with this film though, was simply unexpected. This wasn't a film like the dark knight which provides authenticity to a sci-fi world, or even inception which provided clarity after simple attention. This is a film that is intended to be searched, discovered, thought of, looked at, and inspected in every way possible. And yet, this a film intended to give no easy answers, no simple clarity, no instant gratification. This is a film that wants to defy the odds of films by building curiosity over time rather than losing it. Overall I have a lot to discover, a lot to learn, and a lot to understand from this film, yet I'm extremely pleased with its performance in most categories a film has to offer.",Tenet

2821,thomasellieann,Good But Not Nolan's Strongest,7,3 February 2021,"I might be in the minority here but I did not find this movie's plot to be difficult to follow. I knew what was going on throughout the course of the movie. I wasn't lost at any point except for the first 15 minutes which ended up being at least partly explained soon enough. The action sequences are quite good, especially in the last half hour. They are excellently choreographed and planned. I was impressed by the amount of attention that went into even the smallest details throughout the movie. Even though I understood what was going on as I watched the movie, I was even more impressed when I looked up theories and went back and watched a few scenes that contained details I did not even notice while I was watching the movie the first time.Having said that, the movie was somewhat underwhelming in certain aspects. For one, the plot is actually dumber than what it sets itself up to be because of the villain (I was not particularly impressed by Kenneth Branagh). Once you learn more about him, you realize he fits a very tired Hollywood movie trope. Branagh played a very generic and cliched Russian villain with ridiculous motivations and goals that have been present in movies countless times before. While the action sequences were good, the movie was not as visually stunning as Inception. Granted, Inception set such a high bar and not every Nolan project has to reach it but I cannot see Tenet's action scenes and visuals being held in the same regard as Inception's years from now. There's nothing as memorable here as in Inception. The characters are also generally undeveloped in this movie whereas in Inception, Leonardo DiCaprio's character especially had so much development and backstory that you could really connect with him and root for him. While the lead character in Tenet does have some goals that you could root with him for, they are not as heavy as DiCaprio's in Inception. The performances are fine but none of them stood out to me. In Inception, several of the performances from the cast stood out to me but none of them did here. This movie also felt overlong because some parts of it dragged whereas Inception which was roughly the same length never felt overlong for me.While I do believe this is a good movie, I felt the need to compare it to Inception so I could explain why I felt this was a good movie but not a great movie. The concept of this movie was great but I do not believe it completely lived up to its potential for the reasons I mentioned before. I'm sure this would have been an excellent watch in IMAX though.",Tenet

John David Washington is simply amazing, Pattinson is great and Kenneth Branagh was pure evil.But in the end, this was just not the Nolan-Esque movie I had hoped for.

You could see this film is trying to affect you in the same way Inception did but it's just a very pointless story line and a pretty bad script. When too many things don't add up and they have so many unrealistic stunts and responses I just start to switch off.The only reason I didn't give this film a 1/10 is because it has some really nice locations, some nice gadgets and boats and the sound design and sound track are pretty good.

I didn't have a clue what was going on for most of it! I was hoping it would all make sense at some point, but it didn't. What was that artwork all about for example? Nothing made sense.

I understand that some people didn't like it, because it is hard to follow, watch it twice and you won't be disappointed.
This movie has a vincule with the music and the sound, when you are at the cinema it feels like you where in the movie because of that extraordinary sound that it has, maybe some times the sound can result annoying.

Also, in other Nolan movies, the producer at least gives you a break to absorb the infos to understand the movie, but here the rythm does not give you this chance, and each action piece makes it more and more complex.Also, the picture is somewhat disappointing for Nolan, most actors are doing ok but look like second choices, and the sound is really badly calibrated...Very very disappointing from one of my favourite producer",Tenet

In future, our future generation trying to inversing their world of their time into our time because they lost their resources in future because of our environmental damaging. And the villian SATOR from our time helping future's people because he's dying,
So NEIL (Robert Pattinson) and PROTAGONIST (Washington) as heroes using same time inversing machines trying to stop by inversing themselves sometimes.
As many people don't understand climax of movie ( a secret actually, fully I still don't understand😉)
But yeah something understandable like NEIL has to go always in past to do same things he done for saving world that is why at last NEIL says to Washington (the protagonist) I see you at beginning.

Acting is amazing, John David Washington is a very good actor and I hope to see more of him (maybe too soon to think about this but I could really see him play the next Black Panther). Nolan created a true masterpiece again. The one flaw with this movie is that it sometimes moves a little too quick, causing you to wonder what is happening a lot of the time.

2845,danimita,"The ""Dark Knight Rises"" of Nolan's sci-fi movies",6,3 September 2020,"I really wanted to love Tenet. Inception, Interstellar, Memento... I love so many of Nolan's movies and this one promised to be his next great sci-fi blockbuster.
What we get instead is an interesting sci-fi concept wasted in a pretty dull spy thriller. Stolen paintings, super-weapons, arms dealers, plutonium... for the longest time the movie felt like a decaffeinated James Bond movie. An hour in I still wondered when the film was going to turn its focus on it's coolest element (the time-bendy shenanigans from the trailers).
When it does, however, its explanation is muddled in pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo that makes it feel a lot more convoluted than it actually is. Even the set-pieces feel unnecessarily convoluted and not particularly exciting to watch, though that was mainly because I didn't really care for any of the characters.
At least Cobb in Inception or Cooper in Interstellar were relatable human beings with very real problems to overcome. Here, the protagonist doesn't even have a name...
When everything was revealed and the credits rolled, all I could think of was ""meh"".",Tenet
2846,thelcar-25668,Too much effort required to understand,2,15 September 2021,I invested about 1 hour in this 2.5 hour film before I turned it off. I found it impossible to invest myself into this endless inexplicable maze. I was unable to identify with the characters or to follow the plot. I believe a film should either be entertaining or uplifting. This was neither. Nolan's previous film efforts were far superior.,Tenet

What I enjoyed about the film is that even if there are points where you can't follow along, the movie allows you to pick yourself back up as it progresses.
Visually, it is INCREDIBLE and very unlike other movies you've ever seen, guaranteed. Fantastic box office film. There are some cheesy moments, but it's very difficult to introduce the premise without it. Not all of us have a ""master's in physics"" haha.

2850,DutchJelly,Inception^2,10,26 September 2020,"I'd like to focus on the main criticism of this movie: the complexity.With movies like this you shouldn't be afraid to not understand something at first, because it'll all become more clear later on. That's also why, for example, the music intentionally gets reletively loud sometimes - it's to show that it's not important to follow everything that's being said at some segment. Nolan uses tricks like these all the time throughout the movie, but you do need to be able to use them to your advantage to enjoy the movie.Sometimes you'd forget that we live in a three-dimensional world, and that it's just not our nature to comprehence the 4th time dimension.

2858,bravojohny,Great in all technical aspects - but sorely lacking in storybuilding,3,11 October 2020,"I've just seen this movie a few hours ago. I hate to say it, but I'm pretty dissapointed (since I loved Nolan's movies Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight).What I liked:
CostumesSome of the camera-work (pretty much all that wasn't action itself)Most of the acting (considering the burden of the script)What I disliked:
Chaotic action - I really hate how almost every movie nowadays tries to make action as fast and chaotic as possible. Even though there are a few good examples of using chaotic action - this was not one of them...Heavy reliance on one particular visual gimmick, which gets real old real fastNo memorable music. I don't remember the last time I've seen a new movie with really distinct movie theme. This was just another generic ""try-to-be-as-epic-as-possible"" uninspired score.But most of all - is there some manual for screenwriters/directors nowadays saying that you shouldn't try to make your audiance to be emotionally invested in your characters? During all of the movie I was telling myself: ""am I supposed to care what happens next?"". The Protagonist is just somehow there (and yeah - the the main hero is called is ""Protagonist"" - they didn't even bother to give him a name - or maybe it was just some excersice in pretentiousness). I don't know what drives him, what are his fears, what is his past. Simply - no character exposition with maybe one exception concerning his willingness to obey rules. If he died 1 hour into the movie, I wouldn't mind. The same goes for pretty much all the characters.In conclusion -it's a shame. The basic idea is decent and it is obvious, that most of the of the film crew is really competent. But this movie was just another example of form above substance and the biggest dissapointment in a long time for me...",Tenet

To be honest, these flaws were always present in Nolan movies (Batman Begins stupid final act or Interstellar first act for example) but he usually manage to hide them behind some breathtaking action scenes. Not here. They weren't good enough.

It didn't satisfy me as someone who cares about the concept and the story more than other aspects; There is no special scientific reason for the concept but those defining the occasions, kinda make sense.
The story is complicated like the other Nolanic movies but ""Tenet"" 's story is not quite exhaustive. The story is based on a great complication. Of course the whole movie is solving the mystery but it feels like the writer has tied a string hard and cut it off by scissors.
There is no more special point about the movie. but the music sucks in some of the scenes. ( I love Ludwig Goransson but matching the music and the scenes is a bit annoying _ maybe there is a reason_ )

While this is the case for most time-travel stories, Tenet lacks even the slightest hint of trying to make up for those enormous loopholes by any explanations. Instead of trying to come up with an explanation, everything is just left as being ""mysterious"" and ""unexplainable"". Everytime the story is challenged by some time-trave-paradox, this is swept aside or vainly hidden by another of the unending action sequences. Speaking of the action sequences: they are sometimes entertaining, but most of the time just a drag. Dialog is wooden at best, complete and utter nonsense most of the time. Characters are not developed and have no purpose and the entire movie ist just really a rotation of the feelings ""how long is this going to take"", ""aaah, come on, you have to be joking"" and ""I can't believe Nolan did not invest 5 minutes on his script"".",Tenet

2887,davidebrignone,Tenet: No More than an Action Movie,6,18 November 2020,"First of all: you are going to see an action movie, period. The sooner you understand it, the better. An action movie that, at least, is developed upon an original idea in pure Nolan's style, but that, unfortunately, is not exempted by all the cliché following this kind of films. However, the true problems are linked with all the ""black holes"" in the screenplay: the characters does not have any development throughout the duration of the movie; the dialogues are always (and with always I mean always) boring and foregone, it is basically something you have listen at least 1000 times in different action movies, and I truly believe that it would have been better to cut most of them; moreover, the plot, apart from the (weak) original expedient used by Nolan, is hardly convincing.
The result? You're are left with zero emotions, and no link with the characters at all.
Anyway, if you are able to overcome these problems, you can enjoy a good action movie that will be able to entertain you for all of its length. Because that's it, pure entertainment, no more.
Nolan already proved himself able to do way better, even within this movie's category (did someone say ""the batman trilogy""?). And I don't even mention other movies like Memento or The Prestige: those are another level, unfortunately.",Tenet

2901,arnohardwell-41638,Clearly a misunderstood movie,8,25 December 2020,"In each film I see a lot of critical halves just because the film did not meet the initial expectations of the viewers. First of all, we have to rate the films both subjectively and objectively. So, in view of the above circumstances, below I will say a few things that may not be generally accepted. Tenet has a very honest plot, that is, it is a global espionage that despite the fact that we have met it many times in other movies, it remains interesting. The above comes in conjunction with one of Nolan's favorite things, the time. As a whole the two above make a fairly strong plot.Regarding the negatives of the film: I would agree that the sound effects were much louder than they should have been. Also the plot was presented very quickly and the scenes also alternated quickly, leaving the viewer with several question marks. Additionally, I think there should be a greater development of the central character of John David Washington. Finally, Branagh's Russian accent is quite inaccurate.Despite the negatives, however, things like the visual effects, which never disappoint in Nolan's films, and the incredible soundtracks of the film, which incredibly excite the viewer, come to balance the situation. Moreover, if we exclude the strange character of Washington, the film includes a beautiful and talented cast such as Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Michael Caine.In conclusion, I will say that Tenet may be one of the weakest if not the weakest Nolan movie, but it generally remains a very nice movie which is definitely worth a 7 or 8 out of 10.",Tenet

It is one of those movies that if or if you have to see it in the cinema. there are camera scenes that have never been seen before, and that makes it look original. the story and the plot of this movie is not good but the experience of seeing it with all its scenes are those that are worth watching this movie",Tenet

2908,tajpcb,Sound and Fury,5,1 September 2020,"I love Inception and Interstellar, and I really wanted to love this Nolan film. Alas, I give it a solid ""meh."" There were some fun and interesting moments, to be sure, but the longer the movie went on, the more confusing it became with no real payoff, no resolution, no character development, no heart. It felt a bit like watching someone work on a math problem for 2 hours and 46 minutes--and never getting the answer.I went from trying to understand what was happening, to being frustrated that I didn't understand, to no longer caring that I didn't understand. And, by the way, not only did I not understand what was happening in terms of trying to comprehend the plot, but half the time I couldn't understand the dialogue (and I'm not talking about the backward speech). I kept wishing there were subtitles.Acting was fine, though it often felt a little wooden and I didn't connect with any of the characters. Branagh was the most interesting in an evil, creepy way. But many of his lines (that weren't screamed) were delivered in a mumbled, monotone half-whisper that was difficult to understand. Guess I'll find out what everybody was saying in a few months when I can stream it with subtitles.Music: I miss Hans Zimmer, whose music is interesting in its own right as it helps build tension within the film. This score was not especially memorable. Seems like Nolan tried to make up for lack of plot and character development by making the sound track louder.Another Inception this is not. Nolan is no idiot, but Tenet certainly appears to be full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",Tenet

The issue is this isn't like inception, where you have a pretty good grasp of what the movie is about and then the plot dabbles into the details, rather it takes you a long brewing time of telling what the movie is, which would do great commercially due to prevalent counter-culture, but always has this sense of unnecessity about it.Apart from that, the concept itself is amazing and brilliant, a paradoxical maze of consequences spanning through time and space.The final act is a huge mush of high pace action and intertwining timelines increasing the re-watchability by manifolds but finally diving off to a weak climax.",Tenet

2920,movieplayer,''This is where our worlds collide'',8,29 August 2020,"Tenet is an original action packed sci-fi thriller directed by worldclass director Cristopher Nolan, with its own and unique perception on time and space.The first act of the movie had a minor pacing issue in my opinion.You get thrown into this mix of action scene's, newly discovered materials and different locations within the first 30 minutes of the story. It felt a bit to much for me. Second act is where Tenet really starts to unfold, the different characters and their (understandable) motivations get set up and the 'antagonist' is introduced.Third act ties up all the loose ends and some major clues all the way back to the first act get explained. Therefore, the whole story feels complete and connected. the whole third act is basiclly one huge batlle against the clock to try and stop the antagonist.What i really liked about Tenet is the fact that most of the stunts and car chases are performed IRL, without the use of CGI. Altough the story of Tenet is packed with action, it delivered some great humour to break up the tension sometimes. The fighting choreography was on point, with the hallway scene in particular. Last of all I appreciate the fact that Nolan chose for a lead actor that only did six other films.For me, Tenet missed the 'spark' that I was expecting from a Christopher Nolan film like Inception and The Dark Knight to see this as a masterpiece of a movie.",Tenet

The pseudo-science that Nolan has been using on his last few films (Interstellar, Inception, Tenet) is so lacking in any logic or basis in real science, he should be ashamed. Why doesn't he call a physicist once in a while as an advisor?? Because they would laugh in his face!! Don't waste your time, this movie was a D- effort at best.",Tenet

Clearly no good movies have come out this year and people are grasping onto anything semi watchable and saying it's great as a topic of conversation or for a social media post.

I never felt connected with anything that was going on. People were observing time traversal and entropy decrements (causing the backward time effect) and they were all very chill about it.The villain was a horrible casting. He was the bad guy? You must be joking.The old-granpa didn't want to have a world without himself being alive so he decided to destroy the whole universe. Yeah, right ... great scripting.The background audio was too loud. 40% of the dialog was difficult to understand without subtitles.The script was too complicated for no reason. Nolan did that on purpose so people talk about his movie.I was too much hyped about the action scenes and I've got disappointed it. Look 20 years ago, Matrix 2 has a similar scene at the driveway, much much better.Pros:
Great musicNice surprise with the two protagonists, but nothing special either.tl;dr:
Nolan had great idea to play with entropy and time, but the movie was too weak.",Tenet
2929,junkiedog,Total flop,1,29 August 2020,"I have felt ripped off by this movie. I thought that being from Nolan would be fine, but its not a viewer friendly. It expels it from the film by introducing the science fiction element, which in addition to making the whole plot incomprehensible is ridiculous. We have always associated the forward scenes with movies or series of laughter. Nolan tries to build a James Bond movie with a science fiction element so the experiment doesn't work at all. Kenneth Branagh's role borders on ridiculous composing a comic book villain character.
To make matters worse, we have to swallow the same idiotic scenes twice, backwards and forwards.
It's not worth paying what a movie ticket is worth today to see this mess.",Tenet

In my opinion Tenet offers so much more.Sure the plot requires a great deal of attention, but the rewards are there.It definitely warrants a second viewing and if you like this film I'd imagine you'd definitely want to see ii again as there is so much more in the Tenet plot than you could possibly follow in a single viewing.

I started the film over and put the subtitles on to understand the theories driving the physics of the movie. It's a trip, a good one. It's a perfect blend theoretical physics, action, and truth here and there. John David Washington delivers his lines like you'd expect Daniel Craig to playing James Bond. Hopefully I wont come off as bragging or trying to make this about me but I was also a Marine, so the opening scenes with the swat team where literally everywhere J.D. Washington moved he was running all out with all that gear on. That just hit home as realistic with me, all the gear you have you to wear on patrols can be 100lbs and if you're a mortar man, comm guy, tow gunner etc. your gear can be close to 200lbs and you still have to sprint and move everywhere. I watched the Twilight movies back in the day, I was all about the werewolf's so I had some reservations about Robert Pattinson. However, watching ""The Lighthouse"" and ""Good Time"", Twilight is definitely not what he should be ""know for"". He Killed it in TENET, solid delivery of lines, held his own with all his scenes and earned the emotion of the audience at the end when he leaves J.D. Washington to go with Ives.

2954,bwhite-66195,"Badly edited sound, confusing poor overall.",2,28 August 2020,"Just seen this at the cinema, firstly the sound editing is awful, the sound fx is too loud and dialogue too quiet.
There is far too much dialogue for anyone to take in, and I noticed it gave little chance for the actors to say any of it with any actual meaning and emotion as they seemed in a hurry to spit it all out.
Many people have said second time you pick up all the clues, this is because you can't take in all the dialogue first time but why would I want to watch it again after not enjoying the film, I'm sure you can understand most complicated films after multiple watches but you should at least grasp the majority of the concept first time to not feel you have just wasted your time.
I am usually good at getting my head round a film but wasn't sure what they were trying to achieve in most scenes.

2957,wilhelminajgawan,Good movie,8,2 September 2020,"SPOILERSThe movie was just completely mind warping in a good way. While the idea of time manipulation has been used in the past, the way it is used in this movie is new and fresh. Throughout the beginning of the movie, I had a slight fear of it being cheesy with the classic military use of a new invention and it possibly causing the destruction of the planet, but the cheesiness is, in a sense, avoided later on with the complexity of the plot later on. I feel like there are some confusions that could be made. For example, how is the Protagonist able to go back in time far enough to speak to Neil and have him join his fight? It would take a lot of time in inversion to do so especially if Neil said he had been working with the Protagonist for years. Is this a way of saying that another form of time manipulation is available (i.e. possibly time travel) so that the Protagonist can speak to Neil? Because whatever the Protagonist would have said would be inverted so Neil wouldn't understand him. Anyways, the movie is pretty well thought out, but obviously there could always be more clarification. It sounded like by the way the movie ended, that Nolan might try making a second movie to it, which could end up explaining more, but we'll see.",Tenet

At this movie's core, it's a spy movie, but like with most of Nolan's films, it has something else to it that gives the sub-genre a twist, like Inception, with the introduction of time inversion. I liked the premise and time inversion idea, it's complicated, but interesting, and it makes you as an audience member to actually think about what're you're seeing on screen. The use of practical and visual effects is mindblowing to say the least, especially towards the latter half of the film. I'd say the weakest part of this movie is the opening 20 minutes, it's hard to follow at times and sometimes you don't know why characters are doing what they're doing. But on second viewing, it is easier to follow, and I found myself throughly invested in the story, the twists, and some clever time-bending action.",Tenet

I was ready to enjoy the movie with my popcorn, until they slip the time bending manauver thing that makes me leave my popcorn to cold till the end, cause i'm busy trying to figure it out what's going on. I did not enjoy the movie at all! they are adding more and more detail to the plot and won't bother to explain it (while they should) just to make everything looks more chaos, and selfishly demand us to do a rewatch? Is this some kind of a new marketing stuff?Tenet give us a premises of an action, next they gave us a time bending manauver that they didn't bother to explain, finally
the action blend with it, and we are forced to keep up while our brain still wondering? Sorry, the feeling didn't makes us WOW, but instead it makes us WHAT?..and that's not a good sign for an action moviesNolan was good at this i remember, Momento is exactly dealing with this backwards kind of plot, but what makes Momento so much more better?

The plot, the characters, even the action is not 10/10, but rather the idea behind it and the way it's trying to be done is incredible.I enjoyed the actors and for me, Robert Pattinson was the best for when he appeard on the screenThe plot is a classic action movie for me but it's unique in aspects that you will see for yourself in the movie.Overall it's my favorurite 2020 movie in a year with Little competition.and it's a shame it didn't win a oscar8.5RECOMMEND IT.",Tenet

2964,svetaeva-25819,One of the funniest from Nolan!,9,19 September 2020,"If you're afraid that you will not understand anything - do not be afraid; if your friends told you ""IT IS TOO HARD"" - do not trust them.
Tenet is ofc very well written, I am not really into physics or something, but I do not felt uncomfortable in the theater. So it doesn't feel like having troubles with physical facts and at the same time you don't feel ""stupid"". Easy understandable conception! Especially in the end it's like ""Oh, IT WAS VERY PREDICTABLE BUT STILL GOOD, NOW I UNDERSTAND""!
Yeap, I'm here just to say that Tenet is one of the best movies this year (not because we have like 2,5 new movies OK). If you still haven't watched it - do it rn! It's worthy.
What I want to notice: 1) It is not WITHOUT problems, f.e. sometimes there's no much ""chemistry"" between main characters /not robert pattinson, he was fantastic/.
2) IT IS FUNNY, ofc it's not comedy or something but you will smile during the film and after. (still laughing how they say ""we live in a twilight world"" and show robert)
3) It is VERY Nolan's film with, you know, a lot of thighs to think about; great visual effects; great music; all the views were just fantastic.Do not try to understand it. Feel it))0)",Tenet

2966,seedtheshaman,Hear Me Out (No spoilers in first paragraph),9,21 February 2021,"At times, Tenet can be a puzzling, convoluted mess. It's true. Many may be disappointed on first watch. But Tenet is not a normal film - it is made for specific audiences. It is a movie with many layers. For example, the most obvious is that of inversion, which is the driving force behind the movie. But as you look deeper, there are several hidden plot points and hints that enhance the world and vision of Tenet. I understand not all may be willing to look this deep to find enjoyment in a film, but Tenet is made for those who are. Even if you're not, you can still enjoy the masterful set pieces and action sequences Nolan has presented. As said by Barbara, ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it.""**SPOILERS AHEAD**When you look deeper, there are many subtleties that aren't visible otherwise. For example, on second watch one notices the way Neil acts around the Protagonist, you begin to appreciate what Nolan was going for - each character gets half of a friendship, each knowing the other one's fate. It is a beautiful and unique idea that has never been done before. As well as that, the Protagonist appears to have some feelings for Kat - feelings that he has to bury deep down in order to prevent her death. Like they said, ""Ignorance is our ammunition."" Some may say this movie's convolutedness detracts from its watchability, trying too hard to be secretive and ending up not giving out enough information, such as the Protagonist's name and origin, Neil and Ives's origins, and more. However, Nolan is making a point saying a film can thrive purely on spectacle rather than simply emotion. Tenet was never meant to give us the full story - just hint at it. It was made to come up with a new idea of what a film can be, and for the most part it succeeded. The full story is there for those who want to look for it. Neil's and Ives's identities are laid right there in front of us. We just have to be willing to look. Tenet is a movie for those who like to solve their own mysteries, connect their own pieces of the puzzle, and truly examine a film to appreciate each and every aspect of it. It still boasts incredible camerawork, brilliant action, a masterful soundtrack, and a stunning cast.My only complaint is Ives should have gotten more screen time. I also wish the movie was ten or fifteen minutes longer and gave us more time to process what was going on.",Tenet

2968,RaphaelNeo,Something different,8,8 November 2021,"This is a film that will punish you for not being completely invested into it, you have to pay attention and keep up with the fast moving narrative and the sometimes confusing dialouge between each character. There is absolutely no room to breathe in this film and each scene has some kind of significance to the story. This is again, a film where you have to view it more than once, which can be offputting and might not be for everyone, aswell as the characters which seem to come out of nowhere and don't really have that much development.",Tenet
2969,komaromigabor-95877,"Dear Christopher Nolan, if you ever read user reviews...",2,16 October 2020,"... then let me tell you please next time value your audience more!
You have spent over 200 million dollars on this movie, but you didn't take your time to watch and listen to it before releasing it to the cinemas. The audio is the worst faulty production i ever experienced - we simply cannot hear the conversations!!! The movie wants us to think and put the pieces together, but how should we do that if we do not hear what the characters are saying!!!
My other general inpression of the movie is that after directing such smart and moving movies like the inception and interstellar, you did not care about your audience at all. You directed a movie for yourself, and let your audience figure out whatever they want from it. And finally where is the heart in this movie, where are the emotions? Characters do not develop anywhere and do not ignite any emotions at all. It is a 200 million dollars worth of posing mindless adrenaline rush.
Please for your next movie get down to earth and start respecting your audience again.
With all respect, thank you.",Tenet

That was goodness, now problems .
The charactrization is not so good ,in the movie says no need to understand just feel but i coudn't feel as i should .
Characterization could be better than this . We don't really make sense with the protagonist as movie want and its annoying . There was questions was not answerd and some others storyline cavity's . I think the main attention was on action's and that was so great .
But we had more expection of movie cuz nolan was director .
My opinion is Tenet is a great movie but not a masterpiece like inseption or dark knight or other nolan's movies and main problem is characterization what is not so bad but we expect nolan more . I really liked that and enjoyed . Maybe to make sense with movie you have to watch it twice cuz story is a little complicated and blow the brain what is all nolan's movie are and its awesome .

I think Nolan's attempt on making what he himself loves, spy movies, but reinvented has been succeeded. I really can't believe anyone who would think otherwise. I mean he went all the way! I absolutely love that he wanted to make it as real as possible. That scene with the plane? REAL. I mean come on! When I was watching it myself I thought ""wow this looks so realistic"" and to my bewilderment it was! Everything was so well put in this movie. From the design to the actors!

I would have loved to see more of the character development especially of the main character. One moment he is in special ops, next he is dead, next he is alive, next he is manipulating time.

2986,j-68230-17422,Tenet,8,11 December 2020,"Yes, most people don't understand. For serious film reviews, we can't judge a movie by understanding or not. But when everyone can't tell what's good or not, I think it's something wrong with both the film and the audience. I think everyone knows the story of the emperor's new clothes.
The creed is the emperor's new clothes, stripping away the first-class production and outstanding visual wonders. What is left of this film? What is the significance of the idea of time reversal and time reversal that has been applauded by everyone in this movie? Is it a good movie if the structure is played smoothly, the forms are folded more, and the brain holes come in a strange way? Who can tell me what this movie is about? Since no one can understand the story, please tell me what the movie is doing from any other angle? Are you shocked by the visual wonders, or is the so-called reversal of time and space beyond your imagination? Can't anyone see Nolan trying to patch up a story that doesn't have any persuasion? Do you cover up the inadequacy of narrative through constantly changing scenes? The film scene is rich enough to make the lack of narration in the film seriously dispelled and ignored. For those who claim to be good, I'll ask, what's the purpose of going to the sailboat for a chat? It's OK to have a chat next floor. Do you know why you go to chat on a sailboat? Get your husband into the sea for the sake of the mistress? Just for this plot? Yes, Nolan just wanted to express this point, and then he set up two sailboats galloping on the water, and then the focus of everyone's attention was on the visual presentation of the whole tribe, instead of worrying about its necessity.
An ordinary play can expose the creator's reluctance and powerlessness. Such plays are numerous throughout the film. This malady of Nolan appeared in inception as early as inception in inception, but fortunately, he tried his best to restrain himself, and the logic of the story progressed step by step, which was an amazing work. But in the creed, the scene is completely reduced to seasoning. Originally, the shampoo room could be dried. Nolan Fei had to go to the nightclub. He could have done it by sitting under the eaves. Nolan Fei had to go to the roof. I mean, the scene should be built on the necessity of the story logic, not where it looks and feels. The continuity of a scene is based on the necessity of the story, and Nolan makes the dramatic scene happen out of intention. In essence, it is a ""Internet University"". It has to be made into IMAX. The packaging makes the film look low, but many people mistakenly think it's advanced. Why do I say it's a big net? Because it crams too many things into it, all kinds of settings, various elements, all kinds of strange landscapes, and it has its own surface, but it doesn't tell any point well. For those who brag about the film's good, what did the final war scene take? In such a mess, can't you see the audience carrying the pot?
To put it bluntly, it is the same problem that makes the scene rich and the single scene beautiful, but has no time to consider its necessity and rationality. Nolan is there to spread brain holes and deceive people. A group of people who can't understand and don't want to show that their IQ is low, they follow suit. I'm sincere to my heart. There's no need to pretend to like and approve. It's not a shame. On the contrary, it's the beginning of your true self.",Tenet

If you enjoyed and understood movies like Interstellar and Inception, you will most likely enjoy this one too. The movie is very well made, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is top notch.

The story is amazing and keeps you invested the hole time, and the score is amazing, and I know every body talkes about not understanding dialogue but it isn't that bad and the acting is so good that you don't need to hear the dialogue. The scrip is great as well as the directing, And don't even get me started on the cinematography. My problem with Nolan's the dark knight is that it was shot on 35mm film anamorphic with a aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and IMAX 70mm film with a aspect ratio of 4:3 but the IMAX footage looked like it was framed with the aspect ratio of 2.39:1 as the end goal and no consideration for the 4:3 aspect ratio and so it looked like there was extra space at the top and bottom that wasn't supposed to be there and they did fix alot of that in the dark knight rises, but with tenet it is Nolan's 2nd movie to be shot entirely on 70mm film with a aspect ratio of 2.20:1 and 4:3 with his fist being Dunkirk, but since it was all shot on 70mm all the shots match and the IMAX scenes look incredible and the colors really popped and since it's large format it's super sharp without giving it a ugly digital look that is not made up of blocks but is made up of crystals. There are 3 ways to see this movie and those are in 70mm IMAX, digital IMAX, and blu ray/4k blu ray and I have seen this movie in all of those formats and they all look great and I enjoyed the 70mm the most, 4K blu ray the second most and digital IMAX the least and that's because on 70mm you get such a big screen and it feels like a event, and I liked the 4K blu ray because it is a 8k scan of the IMAX 70mm film that has a equivalent resolution of 18k that is being downscaled to 4K so it is super sharp and colorful with hdr and I did not like digital IMAX cause there were people there that didn't treat this movie like that experience that it is.

3004,jchabo,Very difficult to follow for multiple reasons. Might not actually make sense.,5,26 June 2021,"First off, I love sci/fi. I have enjoyed all of Christopher Nolan's movies. This is definitely a Christopher Nolan movie if there was ever one. If anyone else had pitched this film they would've been laughed out of the office. Only CN could have gotten this made.With that said, if you thought Inception was confusing...then hold onto your butts. Without spoiling anything I'll say this movie seems to be concept over content or concept over story. It seems CN is so enamored with this ""reverse"" concept that he spent more time developing how it would play out in the individual scenes rather than explaining how it works and telling us a cohesive story.As a viewer you spend most of the time trying to wrap your head around the concept while trying to understand the characters motives but because the concept is so murky and difficult to understand you can't really identify why anybody is doing anything. This leaves the characters feeling hollow and unrelatable. It also doesn't help that the sound design makes it extremely difficult to understand most of the dialogue. Also when scenes are quiet most of the dialogue is this made up science jargon that we can't possibly understand, because it's not real.For these reasons I found myself struggling through the slower moments and just waiting for the next action set piece. That's not normal for me. This isn't Transformers or Fast and the furious. Nolan's films have thrived on complexity and tension but I believe he's gone beyond the the general publics understanding with this one. I can't imagine he'll do it again. I think he'll have to reel it in after this one.The performances are good but ultimately forgettable due to us not being able to relate to the characters. Even Inception had simple character motivations that we could identify with. None of that here. They're just doing stuff so XYZ doesn't happen. But why and how?I'm going to give it a second watch but I've found it difficult to get in the mood to ""get through it"" again. That's a sign of a film not succeeding.It's a good looking film and exciting at times but that doesn't save it from being a confusing mess at times.If you like sci/fi, time travel and want a challenge then give TeneT a shot.

The characters aren't entirely flushed out, but the dialogue and acting performances, particularly from John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki are immaculate. The action scenes and set pieces are thrilling and the film looks incredible. The score from Ludwig Goransson is a masterpiece that makes up from the lack of Hans Zimmer. Is it his best? No. But Chris Nolan is really on form for this film.",Tenet

3011,cm-99014,Nolan's movie,6,2 June 2021,"What I meant by the subject line is that - this is a movie only Christopher Nolan could completely understand. I have seen this 4 times and yet to wrap my head around the concepts. Being said that - this is an entertaining movie that asks all the right questions (not necessarily answering a lot of them). It is visually stunning, suspenseful and fast paced. It's definitely worth a watch or two.",Tenet
3012,captainlangley,A Masterpiece,9,28 May 2021,"The concepts presented in this movie are mathematically possible on a theoretical level. The concepts are limited by physical constraints. However, if the physical constraints did not exist, Nolan did a perfect job at showing what that would look like.This movie is a must watch for those that like mind games rooted in hypothetical reality. It may take you a second watch to fully grasp and understand the realization that this movie is a true masterpiece.",Tenet
3013,ninacdonato,Worth watching several times!,10,31 May 2021,"The first time I watched tenet, I was so mind-blown, I also cried a little bit. It was such a thrilling and eventful experience. I watched this movie 3 times in total so far, all with different people each time. I recommended it to them, and I had to be there to watch it with them. Of course, I am going to watch tenet many more times, I never get tired, I get the same thrill and suspense every time. And every time, I understand the plot more and it always gets more interesting and mind-bending. Please watch! (like other reviews, you'll appreciate it more once you rewatch)Also, I super loved Robert Pattison's character; Niel. I wont talk about it too much so I wont spoil. SO JUST GO WATCH IT!!",Tenet
3014,Johnnyutah616,Give it some time,8,8 June 2021,"Honestly when I first watched this film I thought it was garbage but the more I watched it the more I understood what Nolan was trying to go for and appreciate his filmmaking.Give it a couple watches and don't judge this film too quicklyThe film still has its problems but conceptually and visually it's astounding, I'm glad there is a filmmaker that is still willing to bring original ideas into the world of reboots and franchises.",Tenet

Contrary to popular belief, Nolan is not a genius.Style-over-substance and relying on a gimmick. Loud, bombastic and dumb like everything he's done post The Prestige, itself highly overrated. Exposition dumping does not a good dialogue make.Pseudo-intellectuals will love it, just like they love everything this man makes.",Tenet
3016,leoimbeni,Defenitly worth watching,9,13 September 2021,"Although it's a pretty complicated movie (has to be watched at least 2 times) and the main character is kind of boring when it comes to motivations and emotions, I think it's a fresh breath from all the boring action garbage that makes money nowadays. At least Nolan tries to make something new and intellectual and in my opinion he deserves more credit for that. Props to Ludwig Jörhanson for the music(which I did not find disturbing) , to Robert Pattinson for the performance. Really cool action scenes.",Tenet
3017,starrnett-1,The reviews are right,5,16 December 2020,"As many previous reviews have stated, Tenet is a great looking film with some solid action. The Imax scenes are gorgeous and the sound is off the charts. Unfortunately, there is next to no characterization and the plot is beyond muddled. The acting is fine as it applies to two-dimensional characters, but you won't get attached to anyone here. You also won't know what the hell is happening beyond a cursory idea. Nolan sure knows how to make things look incredible, and I applaud him for his ambition in both the look of a film and its ideas, but he does not always fair well in the execution. I'd love to give this film much more credit, but I simply can't. Even with a score of 5, I'd still recommend it for Nolan aficionados and those that love great looking movies. There are some Nolan movies I love and some I love less, but he is always worth looking at.",Tenet

I almost didn't watch the movie because of these reviews, and I'm glad I gave it a shot.The plot, cast, effects, and science were fantastic. I tried really hard to find the holes in the science and plot that one popular review claimed there were tons of, and I couldn't find any. The writers seemed to consider everything I could think of to poke holes in the story and science.This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've seen in years. If you like time travel movies and mind-bending sci-fi, this movie is my #1 recommendation!",Tenet
3019,homerhoff,Fun tension,8,15 February 2021,"I heard a lot of noise prior to seeing this film: it's inscrutable, it's meant to be atmospheric, it's cranial. It's in fact none of these things. It's just a good action movie. And frankly, it's a good time travel movie, too, in the unconventional sense - not like Back to the Future or Avengers, but like Primer (a far more inscrutable movie). Those that liked Interstellar but found the ending too convenient will be much more satisfied with Tenet.
Character motivation is weak in the story, but it's not enough to deter from a film that commands your attention from the first scene.",Tenet
3020,adi_pasa,I wanted so much to like this movie,4,29 September 2020,"My first movie since February due to Corona situation. This movie has such a big marketing, I said I need to see it on the big screen. Boy I was disappointed.
Everything about this movie sucks. The plot is childish. Acting is average. Special effects are non existing, unless you are thrilled to see some scenes played backwards.
The ending is predictible which makes it very hard for you to stay in that cinema chair for 2 and a half hours.",Tenet
3021,hichamhfilms,What a disappointment,5,18 December 2020,"I'm the biggest Nolan's fan. From Memento. I was blown up with Batmans, Inception, Interstellar. But what the f* happened with Tenet? Don't get me wrong, I got all the story, it's a great concept, but it's so many blabla, not enough action, and John David Washington... he was great on Ballers, loved him, maybe because playing himself, but he didn't do justice to Tenet. Nolan should have casted a DiCaprio or Brad Pitt type of actor to carry the movie. I was waiting to watch a good movie for months, and now I'm disappointed from my cinema God... what a bad feeling...
And oh... the Russian actor with a bad Russian accent... he's not Russian, he's Irish... WHY didn't you take a Russian actor why??!!",Tenet
3022,aussiestevemarcos,Very disappointing,4,12 September 2020,A almost unexplainable storyline that has been hyped up. So many questions unanswered and more arise. So many contradictions that try along the Inception theory but doesn't connect any of the dots. Great action scenes but they should have spent allot more time on the plot. Wait until Netflix for this one.,Tenet
3023,edub127,The New Film from C. Night Shyamanolan,1,18 December 2020,"First off, Christopher Nolan was a great director. I love so many of his films: Memento, The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Dunkirk; they're fantastic. Unfortunately, he has changed his name to C. Night Shyamanolan, and this film is exactly what you'd expect from him now. This film is so spectacularly pretentious and smacks of so much desperation to look and sound groundbreaking, that it truly boggles the mind. Let's put it this way... it's a film with time-travel elements that actually has the following line of dialogue: ""We don't know where they are... OR WHEN THEY ARE."" BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME?! There's even a cliche abusive husband who tells his wife that if he can't have her, *surprise* NO ONE CAN! This film makes you feel uncomfortable - in the same way as when you see a really, really bad stand-up comedian.On the plus side, I learned that ""tenet"" is Latin for ""steaming dung heap.""Wake up, Nolan. You're better than this.1.5 stars out of 10 (The score was actually pretty good.)",Tenet

3025,aniljoshi100,Brilliant Must see film,10,26 August 2020,"Tenet is a film that is releasing on the big screen after a lengthy spell of absence of cinema due to covid19.
What a film to kickstart the reopening of cinemas!!! For all the cinema lovers starved from watching on the big screen this is the best film to reinitiate you.The beginning action scene sets the right tone for the rest of the story to unravel. Background score although for the first time not composed by Hans Zimmer is top quality and lifts the film.Time inversion concept is brought in with brilliant dialogues.
The plane crashing scene has been done real time and with no VFX and will be an iconic scene for years to come. Some of the dialogues will be legendary.Washington has carried the film brilliantly well and so have Pattinson and Dimple Kapadia aptly supported.
Must warn you it is a 150 min long film but you will enjoy it every minute of the spectacle.A typical Nolan film that will engage your brains and will make you watch it multiple times to join the dots. Well worth it and lots more!!!",Tenet
3026,FresherThanYourWife,"Yes, I watched it twice, I believe I understand the concept and the complexity behind it. BUT...",8,15 December 2020,"This is still my least favorite Nolan's film. Yeah! I said it.
(Well, excluding Dark Knight Rises which I don't even consider a Nolan film to be completely honest, that's like a Michael Bay film in my eyes, no offense).I absolutely love their work (yes, ""their"", I'm giving credit to Johnathan too)
If you ask me about my favorite top 10 movies of all time,
3 of them are Nolan's (The Prestige, Inception, Memento) - which means a lot,
and if you ask me about my top 20 - Dark Knight and Interstellar will be on that list too, so that's 5 Nolan movies in my top 20, OF ALL TIME.
That's 25% of the list.Anyways, your intelligence has nothing to do with it, don't worry, Tenet simply requires a 2nd watch, as in, it's literally a must.Having said that, although the 2nd watch did make me like the movie more, and I do believe I understand the concept well and the complexity behind it, including some little details I have noticed and missed on my 1st watch -
This is still not even close to that top 20 list.The ride is fun, but even on the 2nd watch you don't know where you're riding to and why and that's due to the lack of ->
a better backstory, better character development and better dialogs -
because it's like all of their mind went into polishing the concept itself,
leaving all of the abovementioned aspects behind.I gave it a generous 7/10 for the idea behind the film and because I cannot say it wasn't entertaining, it's just not on par with most of their other work.Edit: Also I have to say, Ludwig's score was top-notch, BUT, there were moments where the music was literally too cool for the scene. As in, ""nothing spectacular happened that moment, why is the score so good and intense right now?"". I know it's a silly statement but that's my opinion, it was just off-putting.",Tenet

A realy distinctive storyline, beautiful cinematography and a sublime cast. God knows I love Christopher Nolan!Personally I think a movie is good when you still talk about it days after. I went with my teenage daughter of 17 and last days we are both surfing the net looking for explanations, conspiracies and making off's. The concept of this movie realy keeps us having interesting discussions at the diner table.To be honest, the first part of the movie was action packed but we didn't understand it at all. The volume in the IMAX theatre was extremely loud (or overwhelming) and sometimes even too much. I think some criticasters will have the same comments on this movie as on Interstellar. However, at the spectacular scene on the high way, my daughter and I looked at each other because we both had an aha-erlebnis.Okay, the uniqueness of the storyline isn't easy to comprehend for all. Please beware of the fact that ratings under 9 are given by people who don't truly understand the concept of non-linear thinking. I am possitive that having people watch the movie the second time, parts will fall into places.So be sure to give it a try...and a second..and visa versa.

3030,canadagoat234,"This film is exactly what we need right now, even if you didn't like it.",9,9 December 2020,"You cannot deny that this film is original and creative. Perhaps perplexing, but that's okay. In a time of remakes and reboots, rehashing of old films seems to be the trend. Why are we so bent on bringing this film down? Sure it requires multiple viewings with subtitles and I was initially disappointed. Then I was intrigued and then spent hours analyzing the events that took place within the story. Simply looking at the fight scenes themselves, where you have one figure performing movements in forward time and another performing movements in backward time is incredibly complex, and this was in no doubt accounted for by the filmmakers. To go a bit deeper, if you accept the internal logic then you have a lot of fun with it. In freeport scene if you have two people fighting, one would assume that if a strike is thrown and it lands, the person on the receiving end of the strike should anticipate the move if it leaves enough of a mark, bruise or cut, and those that are not anticipated (or foreseen) are the ones that land, because both parties already have the marks and bruises before they even engage in that exchange. We see this with Washington's character during the 2nd retelling of the freeport scene because the knife wound become more acute as he draws nearer to the event. And there you have a beautiful dance of a forward/backward exchange. Of course you can't anticipate every move and so to the viewer, that fight may not always makes sense because it would require you to know exactly what each party is thinking, what their moves may be, how they will react and what their overall approach would be, hence a small bit of the appreciation would have to come from the shear spectacle of it rather than trying to figure out how the fight makes sense to you. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S REWARDING and exciting, but it's difficult to do that when we have our own busy lives to worry about. This movie is great, I'll probably watch a few more times. Kudos for creativity and originality, please continue this trend!",Tenet

Even though the story is confusing, the twists, if you can call them that, are predictable.Cinematography is pretty good, Nolan has big budgets. Action sequences are top notch. The leads did a good job as well. You will need to watch it a few times to make complete sense. But what for? The movie is intentionally made in a way to showcase the vision and brilliance of Nolan rather than it being a requirement of the plot. Too clever by half",Tenet

Very far from the character development of his early movies, the screenplay and the dialogues are also two levels below Memento, the Prestige or Inception.The film is entertainment at its best, stimulates the viewer's brain to follow the plot and it's twists, the cinematography and the music score are awesome (yes here you can tell there is a master behind the camera).In my opinion, the main flaw of the film is the lack of motivation of the characters. Why would the protagonist embrace this odissey in first place? For a girl he barely knows? To ""save the world"" because someone told him to?I will remember this movie for the beautiful scenes: the shooting at the concert, the back and forth in the hallways. I will try to forget entropy, and all those fancy word out of context.8/10",Tenet

However the sound and obviously over used vrummmmm brummmm over the past few years is getting annoying. I have a great sound system, one that will blow most home theaters away.

If Nolan wants to direct a James Bond picture, why not just go do it and leave out all the goofy time-travel nonsense. I'm so happy I didn't bother going to a theater for this waste of time.

3055,ctothzxcvb,Tenet *WARNING* Spoilers,8,9 September 2020,"If you have had the luxury of going to the theaters or you are planning on watching Tenet this review will give you an idea of what to expect. I will not try to give any spoilers that are not in the trailer. To begin, the plot of Tenet is fairly complex. The Protagonist is apart of the CIA, he ""dies"" on a mission and is sent on a mission to save the world. The future and the past coincide and it's his job to find out what is happening and put an end to it. IF you thought Inception was difficult to follow you are in for a doozy. In fact, I would go so far as to say that unless you are able to easily follow what happened in Inception, please don't watch this as your head may explode. They are by no means comparable in terms of plot; however, as someone who just watched Tenet for a second time, there are still several information gaps I don't fully understand. That being said if you have great focus and love to investigate, you love brain games and confusion, I would thoroughly recommend this as it will take you into a wild ride. IF however, you are the average viewer looking to spend a day/an evening ""unplugging"" or enjoying sane writing do yourself a favor and avoid this one. I intend to watch this movie likely two more times, but not until it comes out on DVD/Online. Subtitles are very important here as, with all of Christopher Nolan's films, the writing is essential to understanding what is happening in the film and there are two relatively important characters that I was only able to understand 50% of what was said, because of their thick accent and involved wording. Again, this was my second viewing. All told, I would give this film an 8/10. In spite of being extremely difficult to follow and probably intentional holes that I would like to have seen filled, it is still an incredible idea executed well, but not something for everyone to enjoy.",Tenet

3057,noviembrex,"If you have to watch a Youtube video to understand a movie, something its very wrong with the movie",1,22 October 2020,"For me, Nolan was the BEST director of this generation. I saw Interstellar at least 15 times and I loved it each time. There was a lot of science there, but almost everybody could understand the plot and you dont needed to rewatch the movie to get it. Then it came Dunkirk and I hated it so much. Boring and without heart. It make my doubt about my feelings about Nolan, and my feelings were wrong, as Tenet proves that this guy has lost the floor and he wants to create elaborate plots not with the intention to tell a history, but with the intention to brag to the audience ""see, im so smart and you are an idiot and so dumb to understand my script""Since the very first minute in Tenet a lot of things are happening, but you dont understand a thing. One or two things get something close to an answer, but there are a lot more questions. The result, YOU STOP ENJOYING THE MOVIE BECAUSE YOU DONT UNDERSTAND A THING THATS GOING ON and also you stop caring about the characters in the story. The best example its the last battle. I dont got a thing of what was happening until the end. I got bored for the same reason, if I can understand whats happening, why should care about whats on screen?I had to go to youtube and see a couple of videos to understand what the movie was about. If a movie can be self explainatory at the first watch, it fails, even worse if you have to go to another media to understand what the movie should explain by itself.Yes, the movie its very well done, music, photography, direction, acting, its a clever plot, but it fails to explain itself to the audience. You cant ask to the audience to watch your movie several times in order to start to understand your plot. Thats cheating. I just lost the faith in Nolan. What a shame, Interstellar its my favorite movie.",Tenet
3058,tvrepublic,Meh,6,30 August 2020,"Maybe I have to watch it a second time to appreciate more? Maybe my seat in the cinema was slightly too far back for the sound mix?
Personally, I didn't believe in John David Washington as the 'James Bond'. He was a little less suave and more wishy washy. Not quite stone cold killer, more mechanical like he's remembering his fight sequence.
A lot of dialogue is drowned in soundtrack and Foley.
Maybe the volume of information in the film was what made it instantly forgettable?
I'll no doubt watch again at some point in my life. Probably when it's on the telly one Christmas or Easter. Maybe I'll enjoy it more?
I wanted to enjoy it more and maybe the misfortune of having the next Bond film trailer as a pre curser to the feature out a kiss of death on it?

I'm about 50 and frankly, I felt this movie, unlike others written or directed by Nolan, went too far into make-believe. It has conveyed ambiguity to those minds with questions but frankly did it in a very exaggerated manner.
My husband and I felt we are watching more of a game liked by youngsters or something. LolI Didn't like the movie at all and I rate it a 5 just to give credits to the direction which was great, also maybe there was some good messages there. Other than this, I didn't like much of it.",Tenet

All nuance that might have made it enjoyable is lost. I should have put subtitles on, but the sound still is awful to sit through, and I shouldn't have to for an English movie.

3069,mwjkeane,Metaphysics Masters Required!,8,31 August 2020,"Is this a great film? Yes. The pace is far superior to anything else by Nolan, whose films often feel half an hour too long. The score is perfect, the set pieces amazing and the acting - particularly Kenneth Brannagh, who deserves an Oscar for his performance as uncompromising Sater - is stellar.The mind-bending time-travelling twist is almost an unnecessary adjunct, the origin of which is never clearly explained. It would have been an excellent ""joint the dots and collect the missing pieces"" movie without this, but clearly creating a stand alone Bond-esque film was not Nolan's plan. His prefers to challenge his audiences with metaphysics - The Grandfather Paradox, for example.A little frustrating too, and typical of Nolan and attests why he is so popular with movie studies is the absolute requirement to see his movies at least twice to fully appreciate them, given the complexity of the narrative. Doesn't this insult the audience by leaving them feeling confused, at best, and intellectually inferior at worst?Given all this I still cannot criticise this movie. It will be watched by the majority of the world at least once and I fully intend to buy it on DVD as soon as it is released. I only wish I had a time machine to fast forward 2020!",Tenet

But OH MY GOD now it all makes sense. I don't usually watch films in the cinema 3 times but I trust Christopher Nolan. Even though I was disappointed and confused the first time, I was still intrigued to why so many were calling TENET a masterpiece. This film is not designed for one viewing, I now understand that. The intense design and extremely complex structure of the film makes for a really confusing experience first time out. But when you watch again the plot is much easier to grasp and the characters motivations become clear. The sound mixing however can sound absolutely terrible depending on where you see it. The first time for me it was horrendous and added to the confusion but the 3rd screening for me was crystal clear. Overall this film on and off screen defies time in a way that I will never forget.Only Christopher Nolan can make a film that gets better the more you watch it.",Tenet

The soundtrack doesn't help to bring it together and, instead, is just annoying (Hans Zimmer, this guy definitely ain't).There is a feeling, throughout, that this is trying so hard to be clever that it doesn't want to let the audience in on it. To make it worse, none of the characters are likeable and I just didn't care about them. For me, it is all brains and no heart.

3073,jamescholes,Possibly Nolan's worst film?,5,28 August 2020,This is the first Chris Nolan film since Insomnia that hasn't blown me away. And although Tenet resembles Inception (still Nolan's best film) it is inferior on almost every level.One level where it does impress is spectacle. There are some jaw-dropping sequences and the opening 10 minutes are the most visceral of any movie in recent memory. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is as oppressive as ever but did it have to be so loud?But that's about it. There are no performances here to match Leonardo DiCaprio in Inception (although Ken Branagh is superbly nasty) and the human story just doesn't engage at all. And for me the whole 'reverse entropy' thing lapses into self-parody and just felt a bit silly.,Tenet

It's not necessarily the pseudo-science or the illogical explanation the movie proposes which bother me the most, but rather the execution, the ""fake complexity"" that it's almost a trademark of this type of Nolan films, the endless dialogues where layers upon layers of rules are added to the way the whole universe works.
Does this ""fluff"" bring value to the film? Does it make the story more interesting, more compelling? It's up to you to decide.

3078,shawshank22-567-629684,Nolan Spoofs Himself,6,31 December 2020,"Tenet is hilarious and a mess. The movie opens in classic Nolan fashion, dropping you into the middle of an incredible and bewildering action sequence without any context, lining up question after question as it overwhelms you with stunning visuals and a thrumming Hans Zimmer-y score. T E N E T title card hits and your mind is buzzing with the mystery of it all. Now for the movie to ease up and begin slowly giving us the pieces we need to put together this apparently very intricate puzzle.Yeah, not what happens. The remainder of the first half of this movie is an incomprehensible typhoon of nonsensical expository dialog, relentlessly frenetic editing, and sound mixing so bad you'll have no choice but to turn on the subtitles. There will be a point in the first hour where your brain figures out this movie doesn't actually know what it's doing, and you'll turn on it, real hard. My moment was the inexplicable and amazing hot sauce line from John David Washington, whose presence with RPattz was the only reason I made it through two hours and thirty minutes of this.Once that switch flipped, I was reading Tenet like a full on parody. Nolan leans into his worst tendencies to an absurd and straight up comical degree. Characters are exposition delivery machines with no detectable personality traits. The time bending action concept this whole movie is written to explain makes little sense. Standard action scenes (such as ""create a diversion so the heroes can do a thing"") are way overcomplicated for no reason. The pseudo-intellectual mumbo jumbo talk about algorithms and entropy and the laws of physics sound borderline Reddit post material. Most painful of it all, Nolan still doesn't know how to write women.So that's the train wreck that is the first half of Tenet. The second half cuts a lot of the crap and gets to the stuff this movie has to offer - impressive visual effects and a great score. (Ludwig Goransson deserves a ton of credit.) The reasoning for the film's action set pieces will at best barely make sense. The villain's motivation will be cartoonish. There will be a McGuffin. But at least it stops being an incomprehensible perfume commercial and starts being an incomprehensible action movie.I was really pleased to see Nolan trying to expand his range with Interstellar and Dunkirk. Giving humans elements a more central place in his slick, innovatively plotted action films. Making them about something more than just The Concept (see ""dream espionage""). There aren't many who can make a movie feel as massive and sometimes awe-inspiring as Nolan can. But Tenet is a major backslide and a bad movie.",Tenet

Was one of the first in the world to watch it on early screenings here in Australia. Background score was bit too loud in volume levels as compared to the dialogues. A lot of dialogues were hard to understand, especially the scenes where characters had oxygen masks on. Ludwig definitely needs some mixing skills from the great Hans Zimmer.
Its surely a visual spectacle, 5 times more jaw dropping scenes then Inception. Amazing work and detail by Nolan. I know lot of people didnt like the fact that there was no character back story of any of the characters except Elizabeth & Kenneth's character but I didnt mind it.
I am going to watch it again this week to try and understand the remaining 20%.",Tenet

And whilst I was desperate to write a review with the headline tenet out of tenet, I just couldn't.Whilst the concept is phenomenal the actual narrative is somewhat disappointing. It's hard to realise what we are rooting for, besides the obvious this guy is good and this guy is bad scenario. The driving forces that make inception and interstellar is the element of the protagonist being a father wanting to overcome something incredibly difficult for their child. Nolan throws this element in with a side-character/love interest in tenet and whilst we feel empathy for her because of her situation, she doesn't have to achieve the impossible to escape that situation. The protagonist and friend and great to watch but again, don't have much to fight for or prove - and how they hope to prevent a third world war using their specialist knowledge is unclear, which makes for an underwhelming ending to a promising build up.It's got a couple of phenomenal sequences, and the acting and casting choices were fantastic - but it's unfortunately anticlimactic with the only promise of something to lose coming in the form of a promised war (like the stakes of a superhero film). It's a good film. But on first viewing it falls short of the heights achieved in Nolan's previous works, but perhaps on a second viewing I will appreciate its intricacies more.",Tenet

Christopher Nolan could release a movie discussing his skin care routine and I will definitely go buy a ticket and enjoys it. This man never disappoints me.

You can't understand this non-linear thinking in just one viewing of the film, that's the point. This isn't a movie in the traditional sense at all, this is a present from Nolan to the world. It can be unwrapped, unboxed, discected, etc etc. The ""storyline"" is only made visible to those who have gathered an understanding of how inversion works and then piece the extraneous confusing bits together into a four dimensional timeline that's just a story about a dude saving the world from a bad guy with a big bomb.",Tenet

But the movie is great, and I like it more the more I think about it. You don't need to be super smart to understand it, as some diehard Nolan fans claim, but I believe you do need to be fascinated enough by the philosophy of time to make it a pleasant experience. Without that, I think the movie will bore you and that boredom will probably lead you to miss some key points needed to fill in the puzzle.

The answer to that is yes! Even if its not a 8.8 or a 9 on Imdb , it doesn't mean it's not great!I'll start with cons:
* Sound effects are really good but too loud sometimes and the mixing makes the dialog really difficult to understand and at times you won't understand a word.Thats it. The rest are not cons. We claim that we want something original but in the case of Tenet this proves that we set our expectations to things we like and want something more like that.Its not going to be like the dark knight trilogy ,prestige, interstellar or even Inception.If you're going to be in the cinema looking for someone like the joker , or looking for heist scenes like inception , or looking for strong characters like in prestige and inception. You are not going to get that! You are going to get something original.The movie was a really good and cinematic! The action and fight scenes are going to be something you've never witnessed before.I do agree at times it could be hard to follow, but that's the beauty , the more you rewatch the more you enjoy it and especially without having the regret to have not watched it initially on a big screen with good sound( or not - in this case).Overall a great movie!

Masterpiece after Interstellar worth risking myself to go watch in theatre in this mess,Tenet
3112,cristian-sandor,"Dynamic, puzzling, difficult to follow but rewarding with a complete new SF story",10,30 April 2021,"Firstly,if you'd like to go cinema to relax than better miss this movie.If you are looking for something that takes you away and is challenging to understand than it is for you.The plot is actually not complicated, but this idea of seeing someone's actions in reverse makes it difficult to follow, for some even imposible. I personally gave a positive rate also because this movie comes with a story idea (time travel) that is very well put in the plot (I felt the same when watched Matrix first time). Some may need to see it twice or more times to understand it.The soundtrack music is a kind of dark techno that does not stop during movie so it's engaging - my wife found it loud, for some even unbearable. The music rithm changes really dynamic based on movie action every second, really dynamic. I consider it a big plus as well. There is no time for brake for the 150min.",Tenet
3113,bigstrof,Pure genius,10,5 September 2020,"Every time I watch a film directed by Christopher Nolan I keep asking myself ""how much further should I drive my mind ??"" . The movie forces you to stay focus in order to keep up with the storyline !! So watch it carefully , you might need a second even a third time to understand it completely . Enjoy😉",Tenet
3114,bayleyrw,And the point is?,1,6 December 2020,"And the point is there is no point. I got halfway through and then just gave up. I did not understand what was going on, I did not empathize with any character, I thought the overall quality - sound etc., - was seriously lacking. Tenet is everything that Inception was not. Inception had style, complexity, fine direction, fine performances but the main thing was I could follow it. Halfway through Tenet I no longer cared. Had this come out without Covid impact it would have flopped. Strange little things like the casting - Elizabeth Debicki is tall, there is nothing wrong with that except she made her fellow actors look like hobbits. Branagh is a nasty Russian - that's it. Washington has no flair; I did not believe anything about Pattinson. At times I thought I was watching a version of the The Expendables without the subtlety (can you believe that?). No spoiler here - I don't know how it ends.",Tenet
3115,panavbhau,Another Nolan Masterpiece,10,23 April 2021,Don't belive any of those pretentious critics who already had decided that they will criticise the movie regardless of how good it maybe.It's a beautiful movie in which time is the real protagonist. Watch it.. go on..,Tenet
3116,rapturedinsomniac,Surprisingly disappointing,1,9 December 2020,"Regardless of the main premise of the movie, what struck me the most was underwhelming acting from some of the actors very dear to me usually and horrible, horrible dialogues that made no sense at times and felt completely devoid of humanity.
Also, I would warn viewers not to fall into the ""oh this movie is so complicated so it must be deep and amazing"" trap. No, sometimes the viewer is not the problem. Sometimes the movie has an overinflated sense of self-worth",Tenet
3117,the_housers,I usually like Nolan films,2,9 January 2021,"This is not just a sit back, relax, and be entertained film. It's felt like you have to watch it so darn closely because there is going to be a test at the end. 2 stars at best.",Tenet
3118,cansucann5,Nolan did it again!,8,17 December 2020,I loved all the confusing parts about the movie. Nolan did his thing and made all of us think it through even after the movie ended. All the mistakes and miscalculations are open to discussion if there are any. He just left some part to your imagination.,Tenet
3119,stigiscool1,'Tenet' Review,6,5 September 2020,"I was really excited to see 'Tenet', as Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors of all time. In my opinion, he has not made a single bad movie and I enjoy all of his movies he made so far. As such, I was really looking forward to watching 'Tenet'. So how was it then. Well, I enjoyed it, but I've some major issues with it.Let's start with the good first. This movie looks and sounds fantastic. It is well shot and the score to it is fantastic. The action sequences are also fantastic. It is well choreographed, and very little CGI is used. The cast also gives good performances and they have great chemistry with one another on-screen. And it is also nice for Nolan to cast Indians and an African-American as the lead. There are also a lot of interesting ideas presented in this movie.Now with the bad. The pacing of the first half of the movie felt really off to me. Characters will be at one location at one scene and will be at a completely different location during the next scene. There is also a lack of development in some scenes as well. The sound mixing is really bad in this movie. The dialogue often gets drowned out by the score and the sound effects. As such, I could not hear a lot of dialogue in this movie. This is especially problematic as characters are constantly spilling expositions. Thus, I was rather uninvested in many scenes as I have no idea what is going on. Besides that, most of the characters also feel really hollow and one-dimensional, with the exception of Kenneth Branagh's character and Elizabeth Debicki's character. They are mostly there just to move the plot or to spill exposition. Even John David Washington's character, who is only referred to as 'The Protagonist', does not have much character development. There are also many things in the plot that does not make sense.Ultimately, I enjoyed watching 'Tenet', but there are also many problems with it. If I were to rank it among Christopher Nolan other movies, I will only put it above 'Following' and below everything else he has made. I do recommend seeing it, but not in the cinema now due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Tenet
3120,davidking9753,"Extremely predictable, and As a physicist loving time travel, this is a disappointment.",5,22 December 2020,"Horrible pacing, apathetic protagonist.
I felt absolutely nothing at all.Unlike good fantasy or sci-fi it did not investigate any social or civilizational issues.Simply an disappointment.
Don't waste your money, or time!",Tenet
3121,cuyler_mariama,Interesting,10,11 January 2021,"Perplexing yet riveting!Never have I needed nor wanted to figure out a movie so badly. I admit the second time around the storyline was clearer. A real mental journey of sorts. T'was epic. Will watch again, soon!",Tenet
3122,ZukoFilms,A little less conversation a little more action,6,10 January 2021,"So much talking in this! I'm a huge Christopher Nolan fan but this film is 80% chatter and exposition of characters describing what's happening, what happened or what's about to happen. Time travel is confusing so I understand why it needs to be explained a bit but ehhhhhh. Not that fun to watch an action movie that consists of people in expensive suits having conversations in corridors. If I wanted that I'd watch Downton Abbey. Also, the sound is HORRIBLE, especially for such a talk-heavy film. At one point I wondered if Nolan was editing the film and thought it wasn't confusing enough and then said ""let's mess with the sound mix!"" The characters are mumbling through masks or the sirens are too loud, the background noise is blasting... or if that's not happening the music choice is like nails on a chalkboard. So weird! No joke - I had to keep rewinding and putting the subtitles on because I couldn't make out what they were saying! Disappointing. But it's Nolan so I'll always watch his stuff.",Tenet
3123,atmaveeravism,It's not grand like inception. but why compare?,8,2 September 2020,"I watched this movie because i want to see something new. i don't want to compare it. this movie make you feel that inversion is realistic concept like which can happen in real.
Best thing about this movies is - it get better with time.",Tenet
3124,sofusjunk,Reverse entropy? Ever heard of thermodynamics?,5,30 August 2021,"Once again Nolan demonstrates that he was asleep during physics class. There is no such thing as reverse entropy, not even in theory, to even come up with that demonstrates he clearly doesn't understand basic physics. You can't enter a black hole either, no matter how great a twist it may be, reality just doesn't work like that. This is another of Nolan's empty vessels, and people, because they managed to follow a complicated plot, think they witnessed something clever and are themselves clever for understanding it. He is a great director, this movie being the exception, dragged down by a lead actor devoid of charisma, but he is not the great writer he and so many believe him to be.",Tenet
3125,daniel1946,"Concept before characters, horrible sound mixing and WOW Factor for all your moneys worth",7,11 September 2020,"Tenet, is probably a movie you could call ""different"" and ""unique"", so hats off for that. It's also concept before character. The characters aren't the priority, bar except for one, that maintains a flow and arc to the plotThe first half is pretty bland, and easily the weak part of the film, it really has a lot of issues getting into momentum. Then when it kicks into action, its honestly a great movie. If you don't pay attention however in the ""less interesting"" first half, then you might as well not watch the movieIt has a lot of mouth drops and honestly it can be too convoluted for its own good and I could see ways they could've made it more digestible.The sound mixing however is just as bad, as everyone has already said. It distracted me throughout the whole music. Also some terrible background music, well its not really background music if its louder than the characters? Ruined the film a bit, keep it for the action scenes, but conversations in the movie are hit/missI give Tenet 7/10, all the good reasons to like the movie, are however something you should explore yourself. This is definitely a movie made for re-watches",Tenet
3126,il0vem0vies,Don't understand the hate,9,6 December 2020,"I think this movie was great. The idea was new, fresh & unique. Had some similarities to inception but still was quite unique.The story was good & it had some good twists.The bad reviews seem to be because of the poorly mixed sound which i agree with. I don't think the movie looses too much ratings just because of the sound though?Some really sensitive people here.As a whole I thought it was an excellent movie by the great Nolan!Thanks again for a great movie.",Tenet
3127,joellivesley,"Engaging, thrilling, confusing, complex, inaudible",6,26 August 2020,"It's a really good film, however, it's overly complex and the sound mixing is awful, you can't hear half of the dialogue.",Tenet
3128,cooknbuttler,Waste of money,2,8 January 2021,"This move is so bad, the sound is uneven sometimes can't figure out what they said. Why put a 6 foot 2 inches women with a 5 foot 9 hero. I will say graphics were good but a waste of Robert Patterson.",Tenet
3129,khoi_steven79,Short and sweet review,8,1 September 2020,"It's a good movie, but it's not a movie you can fully understand without carefully pay attention to all details, events, theories, and... yeah tenets. For some people, they can even got lost in the first time watching the movie, and leave it without knowing what happened the last two hours, sure. But even if it is incomprehensible, the vibes and events of the work still give you chills and captivate you throughout the movie. Just give it a try, you will feel excessively satisfied if you manage to solve the puzzle by yourself at the cinema, or if you need to do further research and read explanation, analysis after coming home, it's still a rewarding experience when you finally understand something tricky. Yeah, it's a good movie but we must consider all the things from production, screenwriting, to acting, costumes, music, etc. so I give it a 8 (yeah an easy list of criteria of mine).",Tenet

3131,ajitmahto14,You are watching it again.,9,17 December 2020,"TENET has a cinematic experience which needs to be embraced in a theatre.
Time bending concept, hair raising suspense, nail bitting scenes.
Soundtrack is amazing. Travis Scott's ""The Plan"" might be the best music he has made.
Robert Pattinson has passed his audition for Batman.I'm pretty sure everyone has to watch this movie twice to really understand it.
Spoiler- Time is reversed, so is music(great)",Tenet
3132,hassanejaz2890,Tenet : Best Film,9,4 September 2020,"I loved this movie and I do agree that not everyone can understand when they first watch it but I did and loved it.
Looking at articles and reviews about the movie and telling audience that it should have been more of a friendship movie or there should have been more dialogue. But those people don't understand Christopher Nolan's mind. He makes movies that our minds can't think of. His movies are not like every other movie. Usually a heist or a James Bond movie will always be about stealing some money or being cool. But this is a masterpiece. Reversing time in a way that blows your mind.I wait for his movies every day because every movie I can predict but not his movies. That is what makes it special. The concept of being amazed and shocked. Rather than knowing what is going to happen.",Tenet

3135,fotis-58104,Waterloo,4,26 December 2020,I hear some people saying the 2nd time they watched the film was successful. Or the 3rd. For me the 2nd or 3rd time to watch a movie is because I really enjoyed it. I don't like to compare movies but the 1st movie came in my mind watching TENET was the masterpiece DEJA VU which is one of my favorites. Plenty of similar aspects but more clear for the majority of the audience. There is no meaning to start watching something which you must struggle to understand like doing your homework after school. I'm wondering whether this movie would have reached this rating if it was not coming from Nolan an not having known actors playing.,Tenet
3136,markyk-60135,Worth a watch,5,7 May 2021,"Big fan of Nolan but this film wasn't for me, and people who say you need to watch it a few times to understand.......well no, you shouldn't need to watch a film multiple times to understand it!!! Was worth a watch but won't be watching again.",Tenet

Guns. Cars. Fights. Goodies. Baddies. Loud noises.That said, I wouldn't watch it again. Uninspired performances from everyone involved.

3138,mohamedabdalkareem,"It is an amazing new idea, but watch it twice.",10,26 March 2021,"You gotta watch this movie at least twice before judging, in the first time you have to pause and even rewind to process what is being said and explained if necessary. Second time is after you fully comperhended and understood the movie (why second time then?) it is to lay back and enjoy the movie with no pauses or rewinds because you already understand the movie. The reason most people who are criticizing this movie are criticizing because they don't understand it, and that's just wrong, if you don't understand the movie don't try to justify it by saying you don't like it and give it 1 or 2 stars, just be a man and own it. But if you fully understand the movie then it is okay to give it 1 or 10 or whatever but only after you fully understand the movie, I even argue that there should be a small quiz that you have to pass to prove you understand this movie before the site allows you to review it.Anyway it is a basic Nolan Movie every movie lover should be considering Nolan as a father figure (cinematically speaking) so....... .",Tenet
3139,thejuicebox,"Loved it, but it was on fast forward",8,3 September 2020,"Tenet is fascinating and exciting and fun, but I think the pace was too quick. I really feel like this movie should have been either two movies or significantly longer. The first part of the movie had enough events and things going on to make up it's own interesting movie, but it just felt like a trailer for a movie. I feel like Nolan just wanted to hurry up an get to the main part of the story he wanted to tell. All that being said, I thought the inversion and use of Maxwell's Demon made for an interesting story that was a wild ride of a movie. I will definitely be going back to see this again while it's in the theater because that is the place it needs to be seen. I think Tenet, like Memento, will provide me with years of re-watches and enjoyment.",Tenet
3140,tobiasplasschaert,Solid Nolan movie breaking my mind once again,8,28 August 2020,"Overall it is a solid Nolan movie. The plot is decent and engaging. The mo is is quick, with enough breathing pauses. Camera work, music, cinematography, acting and scenery is great. The story broke my mind trying to figure out how everything intertwines exactly. Just like with Inception, I'll have to rewatch it a couple of times before I completely got it.
Because of this however it didn't feel amazing, coming out of the theater. I definitely don:t regard it as one of his best. Playing with time is his signature but he usually combines this with amazing cinematography so you are still amazed the first time through. I didn't feel this was the case with this one. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it's not what we are used to from interstellar, inception or Dunkirk.
In short: a solid Nolan movie, definitely recommended to watch, but not his best. (My opinion might change once I completely understand the storyline)",Tenet

The whole reverse entropy and time inversion concept was really fun, if you get to understand it even in the slightest. Sad to say i still don't know what the plot is about except for Debicki's role in the movie but i'm sure i'll get the gist of it after a couple of more watches. Ludwig Göransson score doesn't disappoint as always and i think Hans Zimmer put in a word for him to Nolan.

If you're a person just wanting to see pure action then yes this movie is for you, Also there's some intelligent parts, where you need to have brains to understand.

Upon a second viewing however it is a lot more enjoyable without needing to play as much catch-up. Besides that the action is very good, dialogue is well written besides some sound mixing issues in which it make it difficult to hear. The movie could have also been a bit longer so that characters would have had more time to develop. The movie also boasts some great visuals, and an excellent heart pounding soundtrack.

Tenet, a story not only about time travel, but also time *reversal*, is a mix of the last two: ""Whatever happened happened"", and ""Don't try to understand it, feel it."" At the very beginning of the film, the director literally tells you not to think about the mechanism of anything. With all your thinking ability deprived, all is left for you to do is sit back and accept whatever story they feed you, and all the loud music they shout into your ear.When you boil it down, it's just a mission impossible with a ""high concept"" that doesn't make sense.BTW, are we sure this film is not written by Jonathan? /s",Tenet

I was able to follow it (a little) better than first viewing.If you enjoyed Inception you should enjoy this film.Is it better than Inception ? No!

3170,pacificperplexity,"Dont be afraid to admit it makes no sense, because it doesn't",4,6 September 2020,"Nolan is a good director. After Interstellar I lost faith in his writing abilities, and this movie confirmed the sentiment. Its like he watches some theoretical physics lectures on Youtube, COMPLETEY misunderstands the concepts, and then tosses them at the audience to dazzle them so he can create the set pieces he thinks would look cool. And they do look cool, but the overall experience is just frustrating.I'll avoid spoilers, but a major problem with the time travel concept it presents is illustrated in the trailer. There is time-reversed ammunition (he calls it entropy-reversed because he has no idea what entropy means) that jumps out of bullet holes into the gun. So the bullet holes were just ""always there"", waiting to disappear? And nobody notices them? It makes no sense at all, and the whole movie is this way.Perhaps realizing that his sci-fi-ish concept is nonsensical and dumb, he adds another layer of overcomplicated spy stuff involving hijacking a plane and crashing it into an airport to steal a painting (!?), sailing on catamarans for no apparent reason, and a CIA ""test"" that involves blowing up innocent concert-goers. He's on a mission to confuse you so badly you don't even know you're confused.It has its good points. For one, its something different. Its fast, intense, and has a powerful score (so powerful you can't hear the dialogue). The special effects are impressive and made me smile. I'm probably alone thinking this, but I liked the villain- he was intimidating and scary and felt like the most real thing in the movie. So, like most Nolan films, I'm conflicted as to whether or not I would recommend it. Most movies have none of these finer points. Just don't waste time trying to make sense of it, its a big pile of ridiculousness.",Tenet

I just felt a complete disconnection from the whole film, I wasn't drawn to any of the characters and for the most part it felt like they were just speaking their lines.

But its not a 10/10 by far. Its not even close to being Nolans best. the plot is not as fancy or hard to follow at some people make it out to be. Its all explained in the first act, and after that they just run with the premise. Not much suprise, just showing It undlod more and more. Unfortunately it kinda drops the Ball in the 3rd act. The villain is a one dimensional stereotype, and i expected more from Nolan who Usually always crafts characters with depth and motivation.Whats good:
Robert Parttinson! Clearly the Best thing in this movie! Totally steals the show!
The premise: its interesting and Wil keep You focused throughout as it unfolds more and more.

I think they could fix it with some editing. No one wants to spend a hour and a half watching this without a clue of what it's about. Even if they explained it better the background noise made it impossible to know what was said. The plot is so convoluted that they should drop the background noise altogether so the viewer can have some hope to figure out the plot.

The concept of time travel in Tenet is that when you go back in time the whole world around you keeps moving on, but you keep going back in time. It is similar to Benjamin Button reversed aging process, going from elderhood to youthfulness. To be honest, a first time viewer of this movie will be confused to the events taking place, but I recommend if you are going to give this movie a shot, at least do a brief research on reversing entropy in objects.",Tenet

If that's the case then how does he expect an audience to unravel the plot in two hours and enjoy this?There did not seem to be any character development. I felt little or no empathy or interest in any of the characters. It felt emotionless and cold, confusing and I couldn't wait for it to end.People have said it improves with repeated viewings but it made me so aggrieved at the first viewing that I'm not going to waste my time with this again.This seems to be a similar situation as with Tarantino - whereby nobody can seemingly say 'No' to him, which has resulted in this nonsense.I get the sense that Nolan thinks he is challenging his audience into sparking some mature, intellectual or philosophical debate.

Nothing too great, but good nonetheless.I appreciate the complexity, but it's too much for it's own good. I just can't wrap my head around the concept.

Went to see it on cinema in English (I live in Europe but I always see the movies in original version, I hate Dubs) and even if I read the subtitles sometimes, I understood the dialogue. I didn't find the audio as bad mixed as everyone says. Anyway the movie was really good, need to watch it again to understand some parts of the plot that were a bit confusing. But Nolan is such a genius, this was the perfect movie for this summer and maybe the best 2020 movie, at least for the moment.John Washington was a delightful surprise, Robert Pattinson was excellent, Elisabeth Debicki did a good job as well, Michael Caine even if he had 2 seconds of screen time he always fits in a Nolan movie, Kenneth Branagh, I prefer him as a director than as an actor, he didn't convince me that much but he was fine.The plot, I'm entering into spoilers territory here, was really good, during most of the movie I thought it was even more confusing than other Nolan movies and I wasn't enjoying as much as I usually do. But towards the end the mysteries were explained and most of confusion became clear (just most, I need to watch it again because still there are things I didn't understood, specially about Kenneth Branagh's character, they couldn't kill him but in the end they do, but then they manage to change time? Or not?).Lots of bad reviews state that even if it is as good as many Nolan films, it lacks character. This may be true, TDK trilogy, Interstellar, Inception or The Prestige gave us perfect character development, and maybe Tenet doesn't have that much, but for me at least I saw some. Elisabeth Debicki's character had an interesting arc, it was nothing new but it was interesting enough, The Protagonist changed a lot throughout the movie and Neil (Robert Pattinson), along with perfect acting, gave us the most human scene in the movie when he says goodbye and he has to go back. I found out that he died before he said that he had to go back, I recognized him when he died early and I had noticed the orange rope in his backpack.So the movie was definitely good for me, Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers, he delivers the audience smart movies with excellent writing and excellent actors, and he didn't disappoint me at all with this one.",Tenet

If there was ever an example to show sound engineers how not to put sound mixing together, this was it. 50 times worse than the first 10 mins of dark knight rises.Acting - Pattinson holds it well as you'd expect, but wasted because of the freaking music constantly being played when he spoke. The protagonist, this dude has no facial expressions.

Okay, let's jump in Tenet is all about Saving world but in Nolan's style and a mother who wants to get reunited with his son. It also talks about the sci-fi tech from the future the time inversion machines.(It reverses the entropy of the objects so that it moves back in time while the remaining world moving forward). To give you guys an simple example, The time inversion concept is Your mom bakes your favourite cheesecake in the future suppose 2 years from now and she reverses its entropy and keeps it in the refrigerator, Go now open the fridge you will find the cheesecake but it's aged 2 years from the future so now you eat it and feel its not cheesy enough, so now you wait for 2 years to tell your mom to add more cheese when she bakes it . Woila! Now you have a very yummy cheesy cake for your past to enjoy!!Haha!

3215,keithmattg,Intellectual Showboating,6,20 October 2020,"Intellectual showboating. What else can I say about Tenet? Coming from likely the most talented filmmaker of this century, the best I can say is: he was due for a dud.Tenet has all of the visual and audio acuity and genius of any film by the contemporary prodigy, but even Nolan's best conceptual flexing flying parallel with his eye popping action falls flat without fleshed out characters - something Nolan seems to have decided is too base for his most intellectually ambitious feat yet.From start to finish you know nothing about the main protagonist, not to mention the characters he meets along the journey. If the anonymity of Nolan's chess pieces is somehow intentional, it's certainly over my head.Nolan is more practiced than any storyteller in the use of time as a subject of his films, but without the genuine human element (which, until now, he has more or less perfected), all of his action packed conceptual adventures taste more like gimmickry going down, and instead of the catharsis you ordinarily feel at the end of his films, you're left feeling hollow, like you're supposed to be feeling something that you somehow weren't elevated to.But you didn't miss anything, unfortunately. Unlike Nolan's masterpiece, ""Inception"", there won't be any rewatching to wrap your head around conceptual gymnastics and depth - there's none of that needed. Not really...

It was executed well, technically, but how it affected the storyline (e.g. not being able to breath ""inverted air"") mucked up the waters and made the movie itself confusing.

3225,valerider,A piece of anti-art by Nolan,8,18 April 2021,"To me, Tenet isn't like Nolan's other ""mind bending"" films. If you go in expecting it to have the emotional pull of Interstellar, or the seriousness of Inception, you will be disappointed. It reminded me more of a piece of anti-art, almost deconstructing and satirising Nolan's own works and everything around him- more like Paul Verhoeven (delivering Hollywood blockbusters that also fire all guns inward at Hollywood blockbusters). I found it deadpan, deliberately messy and playful, like Nolan had decided to make a Sam Mendes era James Bond film that ruthlessly shreds itself and implodes in on itself for our viewing pleasure. The Rotas square riffing is fun and also a warning of where he is heading. Don't try translating a Rotas square literally, you will go mad (good puzzle, no answers, right?). Also, the Rotas square is a superficial puzzle that was used to stop others getting to a simpler, purer truth hidden within (or maybe not)......
I can see why some people hated the film, as it was obviously designed to be contrary, play with your head, frustrate you, force you to stand back, think, and then draw back in again on the palindromic rebound for another beating. That's quite a brave structural ask of an audience and you will invariably lose some before the ""stand back and think"" part. Personally, I found it went very quickly (much faster than other Nolan mind benders). I can imagine in the future people will return to this film more often than Interstellar and Inception because it is actually lighter, more anarchic and each time you watch it, there will be a different set of conclusions (and arguments with friends). Don't forget- the protagonist Arepo keeps the whole shebang turning. Or does he?",Tenet

The biggest mistake is the two sousaphones you see on stage. A real orchestra would have real tubas, not sousaphones! What a joke. Then there is the tuning up sounds. Even if you give Mr. Noland some license to make that sound more eerie than in real life, it still sounded unrealistic to me. They when you see how the orchestra is seated on stage, the best I can say it is not how you would normally set up an orchestra on a stage. Seems like they had no one on set who knew anything about making the start of the movie look and sound real. For me, I could not get this out of my head and it ruined the rest of the movie for me.

3235,zapadahitesh-24653,"This movie is only for science freak, they can understand in a better way.",8,8 December 2020,"This film is not a time-travel film. It deals with time and the different ways in which time can function. Not to get into a physics lesson, but inversion is this idea of material that has had its entropy inverted, so it's running backwards through time, relative to us..There is some element of physics. There is some element of science. It's trying a little bit. Compared to previous movies, like Interstellar, the gap is maybe bigger. It's far less grounded into physics. There are a lot of times where they use science jargon and it's just jargon with no content.
Entropy is the measure of the level of order or the level of information. There's a really fundamental law in physics telling us that entropy always increases. On average, things get more and more disorganized. That's why we grow older - our body gets slowly more and more disorganized. That's why it's much easier to destroy something than to construct something. At the physical level, if you have a box and you put some gas in it, the gas will start taking up the whole space. It will spread and get more and more disorganized. When entropy increases, it means things are becoming less and less organized.Entropy out of the way, Tenet also deals with a concept of 'inversion', which an Empire article explains as: ""Inversion is a process whereby an object (or person) has its entropy reversed, essentially flipping its chronology so that from that point on it travels backwards in time instead of forwards.""In the film, the protagonist -- named Protagonist -- is sent on a mission to stop a possible Third World War. At the beginning of the film, an Esquire article attempts to explain, ""the Protagonist meets Clémence Poésy's scientist, who informs him that at some point in the future, a technology is invented that can reverse the entropy of people and objects."" The tech has been monopolised in the future by a Russian oligarch named Andrei Sator, who has created an 'algorithm' that allows him to 'invert' his 'entropy', via 'turnstiles'Sator is dying, and taking a chapter out of the Bond villain playbook, he plans to take the entire world down with him by attempting to 'reverse the arrow of time permanently, which means that rather than simply flowing backwards, the people in the future would be able to overwrite the past.'
The film concludes with a large scale action scene that unfolds both forwards and backwards, while parallel scenes involving past and future versions of the same characters play out. To stop Sator, several events are put into motion, and a 'temporal pincer' strategy is put into effect. What is a temporal pincer, you ask? According to Empire, ""It's a time-bending tactical technique for missions: you approach it moving forward in time, and then also approach it in reverse moving backwards from the future - each side using the knowledge that the other side gained from having already experienced it. Except, both sides are actually experiencing it simultaneously.""The 'heroes' are divided into two teams -- one moving forward in time, and the other backward. ""Thus you have inverted and un-inverted Tenet soldiers fighting against Sator's men, while The Protagonist and Ives (played by a near-unrecognisable Aaron Taylor-Johnson), both on the red team, head down into the bunker to nab the Algorithm,"" Empire continued.There's also additional information about possible environmental damage and the Earth becoming uninhabitable in the future, but the film doesn't dwell on that too much.It ends with a revelation. The Protagonist has been the man in charge of Tenet all along. He has already experienced the events of the film, and stuff that happens after it ends. He recruited himself for the mission. His aide, Neil, played by Robert Pattinson, has been moving backwards in time, while the Protagonist has been moving forward.Esquire explained, ""The Protagonist inverted himself in the future, set up the whole mission, then went on to recruit Neil and arm him with the information he needed to help. He also, it would appear recruited himself, setting up the mission which he would recruit his past self into without knowing that the version of him the future is the one pulling all of the strings.""His loop closed, Neil tells The Protagonist, ""'What's happened, happened', but instead that in the future the world was always safe because they had already gone into the past to make it so.""",Tenet

3239,zhaoxinglyu,Time will prove its quality,8,2 October 2020,"To be honest, it got me confused when I first watched this movie in the theater. Additionally, I wrongly chose the 4-D vision, which let me feel dizziness both mentally and physically.Surprisingly, in this movie, Nolan, the director, did not use actors who appeared in his movie before since Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy often act in Nolan's movie. Robert Pattinson, the old days' vampire prince, showed strong performance to the world to let audience realize that apart from the pretty face, the acting ability is also excellent.The detail is noticed and controlled considerably by the director. Despite it is difficult to understand backwards time, many details about the theory is well designed. For example, when Sator interrogated the Protagonist, it is the translation came first followed by the words speak by Sator, which is inverse to the reality.It might be wrong for us to use the normal thoughts to try to figure out the backwards time. Like the movie says, do not try to understand it. There was another movie, Arrival, which told the audience try to use circle thoughts instead of the linear way. Though I viewed Arrival years ago, I still do not know the how to implement the idea expressed in that movie.Though it confused me a lot and many parts were figured out when I watched it again, I still rated 8 points to this movie, because the masterpieces made by Nolan let me trust his consideration. His movie can bring new thoughts and new ideas towards the world to me always. This reverse time travel truly let me recognize the variety of time travel than just following the linear time. Therefore, I choose to believe that the reason of confusion might be our thought cannot catch up the consideration of Nolan or we might need to use a different approaches to think things like I mentioned above. The same confusion might happen to the first audience who watched the movie, Back to the Future in 1980s. And after several years, when we look back at this movie, we might take its logic and find it is a pioneer for the next development revolution in human history.",Tenet

There is absolutely no character development. The relationship between the characters is.... Random at best, stupid at worst.
They randomly meet and know eachother, and the movie excuses this with ""They're from the future, and in the future they would know eachother"", in fact EVERY incoherency in this movie is excused with ""sometime in the future"".
The antagonist is apparently just evil and selfish for no reason. While this may have worked in the early movie era, this is predictable and boring.

Some ""questionable"" casting (by that, I mean could have been better, not that they're bad): namely Washington, Caine (in a completely pointless appearance), & the perpetually hammy Branagh (WHY people think this guy is some sort of a thespian is beyond me. Someone like Fassbender could have hit this role out of the park and made it one of the greatest villain roles ever put to screen; in the hands of Branagh, it becomes just another cliched foreign bad guy).
Also, though it is a very complex intelligent twisty turney plot, it is a little too pretentious for its own good. It really needed the expert balance of complexity, vision, and soul that Jonathan Nolan's capable of (he has nothing to do with this, and you can tell).
But 2 things make this film a must-see: Christopher Nolan's directing, and I don't know who did the score for this, but it wasn't Zimmer (I know, I'm shocked too). However, they did a great job of sounding like Zimmer! Awesome score.MILD SPOILER ALERT BELOW:
And Chris Nolan's directing is definitely on point here: it took a lot from The Dark Knight & Interstellar, so if you liked the directing of those two, you will love this! BY FAR the best aspect of the film.
But the writing could definitely have benefited from a little Jonathan Nolan touching up. There's extremely little focus on character development (you don't REALLY care about any of the characters), & the dialogue could have been better written (again, it's not BAD - just not Jonathan Nolan good).
Definitely worth a see though! Awesome directing.",Tenet

.
Now the plot seems simple when you go into the movie an agent trying to prevent WW3 but really its not easy it's one of those movies where you have to pay attention to every single detail. The first act is pretty easy to follow I'm not gonna lie but then comes the second act where most of the characters are introduced (either in the start of the second half or the end of the second act) and a lot of shit happens in the second act that gets very very confusing and the sound and score in the background most of the time get so loud where to the point you can't even hear characters say especially Kenneth Branagh's character idk maybe it's me I've been told that the IMAX versions are better. The third act loosens down a bit as its pretty much just minuets of epic action and vfx and as the movie continues imo it gets easier and easier.
.
The action has to be the best thing about the movie the stunts are so well done and it's just so fucking enjoyable there's one whole action sequence I really enjoyed where the plane crashes I'm sure its shown in the trailer every minute of that scene is just so damn fun to watch. The characters are all unique in its own way and that's what I really admire about them and Nolan's writing he always makes sure to have something interesting for every character in script. If I'm being honest, I found Pattinsons character more interesting and cooler than Washington's character. Every time Pattinson's character appeared, I was always excited and intrigued. Another character that got me intrigued every time he appeared was Himesh Patel's character Mahir what I liked about him so much was his charisma and his high esteem. All the other characters were great especially the villain I wish a good few of them were explored more. He didn't scare me, but he would have me stressed lmao.
.
Filmmaking wise this is a very well-made movie not really surprised because its bloody Christopher Nolan his movies are always well made but it isn't as on par as his other movies like Inception or TDK. Direction as always was of a very high standard Nolan really knows what he's doing right or wrong. Script is smartly written you really have to pay attention with the dialogue like I said to enjoy it which I find odd but in a good way. Acting is like the direction very high standard and it is very good the cast is very talented, and all have many great moments and damn I really love Robert Pattinson's acting and his hair man his hairstyles are always flawless. Score from Ludwig Göransson is amazing it so surprising TENET isn't composed by Zimmer I really love Ludwig's effects on the audience its so tense yet satisfying at the same time.
.
I told this to my friend, and I think it's stupid, but Nolan could legit launch a whole college course/PHD all based on the TENET universe and I would take it it's a lot of explaining. I've basically seen the whole internet comparing this to Inception or either say they're connected but I wont comment on that cause this is non spoiler but I would say that Inception is more easy to understand and its explained very straight forward compared to this a second watch is indeed required. In the end just enjoy TENET I think you'll think its okay or love it like I did despite the confusion fingers crossed I can have a second viewing before school starts8.2/10 or 8/10",Tenet

But... what the hell are they talking about, I can't hear them over the overly loud music. Sadly this continued over the whole movie and only made it more confusing. I can understand making a movie in which some intelligence is needed to understand it however this brought that to a whole new level.The overall Plot was Ok, but for being such a 'clever' movie it didn't use the potential is could have used. After introduced into the main plot of the movie all that continues is several confusing scenes with very cinematic looking shots and CGI. It should have been made to be much simpler in terms of plot, but still kept the main idea.The acting was fantastic as well as all the action, however with many sections of the movie, I am watching just people running around shooting (not sure what), and it doesn't get explained (or if did could hear any of the dialogue).Yes, it may be easier to understand it after a second viewing, but I would like to watch a movie and understand it without watching it again and watching a 1 hour explanatory videos.I will be amazed if any normal movie goer could tell me the whole or even sections of the plot after watching it",Tenet

Let me start by commenting on the acting ; it was beyond phenomenal. We did miss the Hanz Zimmer touch but the music was very good.

The dialogue is boring and bland. Nolan uses exposition way too much. Exposition is used for everything. To introduce characters, motivation, the concept and in the end, we get a movie that I just don't want o see anymore. There is no real emotional conflict to the Protagonist. Compare this to Inception where the main conflict was whether Cobb will get to see his children again. It was grounded and there was real stakes. In Tenet, its just they got to save the world. We as an audience member know its not going to end, so there is no real stakes. This is all a shame because Tenet has some of the best action scenes in recent history. The fight scenes were creative.

This movie is an excellent film with some serious thought going into its complicated design. The sad thing is that a lot of people are going to hate on this film because they could not keep up with everything going on in it. There are many layers to this movie with many things that pop out once you put more thought into your viewing. If you struggled keeping up with Inception (another excellent Nolan film) then this movie is going to much harder for you to follow.The largest complaint I had with the movie is that it felt as if the music was too loud. I wasn't sure if it was the theater I was in or the movie itself. I have since seen a few reviews that said this was intentionally done in order to obscure some of the dialog so that it doesn't give away the plot and twists. During the movie I kept thinking to myself that I can't wait to watch this with subtitles so that I know what people are saying. This is now doubly more true to see if these are truly obscured on purpose and add another layer of depth.If you like movies that make you think and love to try to foresee what is coming (and then love it when you don't see it all) this is definitely a movie for you. It is also a very action packed movie that has some great action scenes. However if you just want an easy watch to relax and mellow out to this is not your movie.(Spoiler Section)There are so many hidden nods and items in this movie you can not catch them all in one watching. Some you will really have to think for such as the use of the title and how it ties into other names such as Sator and Arepo. However, I was surprised that Tenet itself was not used very much in the film. It was a bit of a early mechanism that fades away rather quickly. The word itself seems to be more important that it's use in the film.The acting is excellent and is well cast. Robert Pattinson and David Washington really shine together on screen. It felt like I was watching a Bond film with two Bonds at certain points. The scenery and sets are really well done and have a lot of depth and thought to them such as the use of Red and Blue to show the inversion versus the normal time.(Major Spoiler Don't Look If You Don't Want to Know)The one question I am really left with is: If he was the mastermind then who recruited him to become the mastermind?",Tenet

I have watched it twice as of now and can say with confidence that this is his best work since Inception. Not only he plays with time here as we saw in The Interstellar (2014) but creates a new ground of reality altogether. A lot of exposition thrown at you with a whole lot of Jargons to follow which are explained so fast that you can't even blink your eye and I am serious ( so much for Tight editing 😁).The film is visually a treat and as we all know Mr. Nolan has a habit of using Real props and strict NO for CGI, the end result is just mesmerizing. The scenes shot in Mumbai with Dimple Kapadia's Priya are just pure fun and captivating. In short you need to feel it rather understand it (It literally tells you in the beginning of the film).Even Narcissistic men can't possibly decode this unsolvable possible in one go let alone the others.The soundtrack is not by Hans Zimmer this time due to some Pre scheduled work, but Mr. Ludwig Göransson is simply apt for the movie and adds to the already tension filled environment with a penace.John David Washington and Robert Pattinson both have done some extraordinary work both mentally and physically doing their own stunts and whatnot.I promise you this, you haven't seen anything like this before even if Don't understand everything at once 😂.

I think this is Nolans film, where he forces to focus the audience the most, and this is a good thing! Be prepared from the start, and keep up. Look on every detail, to not only feel it, but understand it a little. The movie made me ask myself questions about the future, and the hint about the true dystopian dangers such as climate change was brilliant.

If you liked inception but found it too easy to understand by some miracle, then this film is perfect for you.A first watch will give you the story but in order to fully experience it, you will most likely have to watch it at least twice but in my case it was three times. It is a large commitment if you want to understand it, so if that isn't for you, I would recommend you watch one of the older Nolan films or perhaps go for a more mainstream, stereotypical action movie.The film was still immensely enjoyable and is guaranteed to stick with you as one of the most memorable films that I have ever watched.",Tenet

Then the last ""finale"" where 2 teams shoot in all directions but against who? Bullets everywhere but no casualties, no injuries, no deaths.

3352,madmaxdk-10071,EPIC MOVIE FOR THEATRES ONLY......,10,28 August 2020,"ITS BRILLIANT . The world is about to end and the time is ticking, but backwards. Well, for most part. Writer-Director Christopher Nolan's mysterious magnum opus is a film full of an eventuality that feels quite surreal in the precarious times we live in. 'Tenet' opens with a bang as a packed National Opera House in Kiev is invaded and is about to be blown to bits. This is a pre-cursor to quite a few such instances that infuse a dose of action and excitement even when the film's rather convoluted plot might bog you down. But that said, the overarching idea of its plot is fairly simple. It's about saving the world from an insanely powerful Russian arms dealer Andrei (Kenneth Branagh), who could go back and forth in time. Now, the idea is to beat him at his own game. But in execution, 'Tenet' is every bit the high-concept, make-believe and far-fetched flight of imagination that blends action, adventure and intrigue. And Christopher Nolan manages to use many of these opportunities quite effectively.
Our hero John David Washington (known only as the Protagonist) is explained the concept of 'temporal inversion' and sent off on a top-secret mission to save the world. He is joined by his British counterpart Neil (Robert Pattinson), whose origins remain a mystery throughout. The mission takes him places including Mumbai, where he breaks into a wealthy arms dealer's house for information where his wife Priya (Dimple Kapadia), gives him cryptic leads that cannot always be trusted. But it's only when he meets Andrei's estranged wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) that he realizes the full potential of just how complex and diabolical the situation is.
The film's screenplay keeps underlining and explaining its layered plot about technology that can reverse time. Thankfully, it does so with stunning cinematography (Hoyte Van Hoytema) and action-packed scenes that are executed with a natural flair and finesse. The idea of going back in time where everything moves in reverse, creates a visually appealing imagery. And the original background score (Ludwig Göransson) is so unique and immersive that it builds just the right amount of urgency and tension.
Everyone is quite aptly cast including Dimple Kapadia, who lends a certain gravitas to her enigmatic character of a powerful Indian woman. She would much rather offer her husband's assassin a drink and pacify him than panic at the sudden break-in. Her role is not only crucial but also quite fascinating in the way she deals with the Protagonist. Robert Pattinson is charming but remains strictly in a supporting role, never overshadowing the Protagonist, played quite effectively by John David Washington. John's brooding persona and no-nonsense dialogue delivery is impactful. Elizabeth Debicki is honest in her part as an abused wife held to ransom by her chauvinist husband, but could have been more convincingly written. Kenneth Branagh's character of Andrei is quite the caricature of a Russian Mafioso with a typical accent and snarling dialogue delivery.
Just like most Nolan films, this one too demands full attention from its viewer, yet there is no guarantee you will comprehend the film's nuanced narrative in its totality. But that doesn't take away from enjoying the cinematic experience of Nolan's vivid imagination that is skillfully portrayed on the big screen. The secret to enjoy 'Tenet' lies in what a scientist, who is explaining inversion tells the Protagonist, ""Don't try to understand, feel it.""",Tenet

the movie itself was absolutely breathtaking,
great actors, breathtaking and amazing special effects.However, ""some details will have to be reworked"" such as:1) The starting was great at the National Opera,
howbeit, I had no clue what was going on...2) The Indian character appeared at the beginning with grey ish hair,
and during a further scene, she was blond...
Was she the same person, or perhaps, was she coming back from the past and redo her hair?The music was too loud mostly in all scenes.I could barely understand the curator's posh accent in some scenes( And I'm a Londoner ), cause the music on the background was so loud, I was trying to read her lips unsuccessfully, the actress didn't articulate properly.It such a real shame, I will not waste another 2hours 50 minutes re-watching that movie.Howbeit, I would like to recommend you to be fully rested and very focused during the screening of the film.Thank you for reading, hoping this review was helpful.

3361,barunboudh,An expression of Nolans mind,9,28 August 2020,"Firstly, on an IMAX screen this movie looks incredible and the sound is powerful. The action sequences with reverse entropy are groundbreaking and work into the fabric of the story and action really well. The thought of people running backwards sounds 'silly' however Nolan pulls it off effortlessly, the first scene we see this done really grips you into the movie and from that point on you are locked in for a great ride.As always Nolan has a complex story which in many ways like inception and memento leaves the audience to fill in some of the very strategically left blanks, which will keep you thinking long after the movie has finished. He gives his audience enough respect not to turn this movie into a science lesson which allows plenty of room for action.Overall this is a very smart, stylish action packed movie with a detailed story that delivers superb cinema.",Tenet

Saw it on TV same thing with Interstellar -brilliant ! They needed to be seen on the big screen but they were still brilliant . The Batman movies -brilliant I've been planning on watching memento his first movie soon, as that has a unique timeline to it.I assumed this may be on the same level except of an international /James Bond type of movie which is what Christopher Nolan said he was aiming at. That's my kind of movie . Okay it pops up on HBO and What a Sad gigantic disappointment. I'm happy now I didn't spend my money and see this movie in the theater. What an eccentric mess disaster of a film. I have read here that you have to see it a second time to watch it to really understand it but being that this is a 3-hour long movie I am not spending another 3 hours to figure out the algorithm that is required to figure out the algorithm within the movie of the linear timeline about going forwards and backwards all at the same time. It's an eccentric mess.Reminds me of when Spielberg did his early movies such as jaws ,close encounters, only to do ""1941""an astounding eccentric mess over-the-top film .this is exactly the same thing going on here. Major arrogance and eccentricities creeping into a big-time director they think they can do anything and we're going to like it . I'd say Watch the movie in small chunks here and there just to see the visuals it has beautifully filmed stunt scenes, but I don't get any feelings for any of it there's no emotion there's no soul. It's an empty Hollow film I'm shocked how what a confusing mess this is and this is coming from a big Christopher Nolan fan.",Tenet
3366,HK416,It's an excellent film.,9,24 August 2020,"Tenet's story is more complex than Nolan's previous works like Memento.Unlike the Inception or Interstellar,The length used to explain the theory is shorter.In 150 minutes there are lots of information,especially in the last hour.So after I finished watching it,I felt a little muddled about some details.However,Tenet is certainly a visual feast and you will feel amaing about Nolan's narrative structure.The acting of those main roles is very brilliant,too.And the music is really enjoyable.I once doubt whether the music is good enough to create atmosphere without Hans Zimmer,beyond my expectation,it has a strong sense of rhythm which is really fantastic.(PS:I think some of them even can be reverse played.)9/10,the reason why deduct a star is that there are some details I didn't comletely understand(I think I must see it for the second time) and Nolan's characterization of characters still have flaws.",Tenet

An agent tries stopping time from running in reverse, because of a future running from a ruined tomorrow.Thumbs up:
The score by Ludwig Göransson and Travis Scott is excellent, production values are top notch, and the stunts are sensational + believable. Kenneth Branagh's the best actor on screen - fearsome, fatal, focused and free.Thumbs down:
Character motives and choices, along with certain plot points, aren't always the most original or convincing. The dialogue at times becomes overwhelming exposition. Fight scenes aren't always well-defined. And there's not much of an emotional hook for the protagonist, and ultimately, the audience.Favourite scene:

3376,dorianimages,Of course it's confusing,9,11 September 2020,"Whenever you're watching a film that deals in time travel, there is going to be confusion. Here you have a movie where timeliness are crossing each other and nothing seems to make sense. If you walked out halfway, I would agree that this movie is confusing. If you stayed until the very end and are still confused... then perhaps you should avoid these types of films.Christopher Nolan always tries to challenge the viewer and here he goes all in. However, the story is not very complicated. It runs in a linear fashion, but multiple time elements get thrown in between. Sometimes it is overwhelming and you're asking yourself ""what is the point of it all?"" And then you go ""Ok, I get it."" In my opinion, this is not an action movie. It is a drama with elements of action. If you go in wanting to see an action movie, you may be disappointed.The truth is that this movie really has no concept of time. You don't really know what time the protagonist is from. You know the time in which the film takes place, but not sure which time the characters are from. Rob's character seems to be hoping all over the place. In fact, I am inclined to believe that he is the son of the Russian terrorist as an adult. Which would mean that the protagonist is from the future as well. This is made clear in Neil's and Protagonists last conversation. We know how Rob dies, but we don't know how they met yet. It would also explain why Protagonist is so driven to save Kat and hers son. Anyway, not going to spend this time to go over theories.The movie was loud at times. I didn't have any trouble understanding what was being said, but it felt like you were in the middle of what was happening. Typically a good voice dub would correct this, but for some reason they passed on this. The music was too loud at times as well, but I saw the film at the drive in and had full control of the volume, so it wasn't too distracting. I thought the soundtrack worked. I missed the Zimmer sound, but maybe it would have been too reminiscent of Inception.All in all this was a very simple story, but with complex elements of physics and time travel. So if you wanna see it and critique the science, then you are going to miss out on the story. Acting could have been a bit better at times of tension, but the story had good pacing. I would definitely watch again, knowing what I know now from the first watch.So in essence I am going to go back, rewatch something that already happened, with prior knowledge and approach it differently. If that seemed confusing, then you might wanna pass on the first watch.",Tenet

Prepare for a rant lol.Tenet's concept is so self indulgent, I can just picture Nolan in the editing suite hitting rewind on certain scenes and saying ""There I did it i'm a genius, Oscars for me I made characters go backwards I'm such an original"" it's so protentious and every character insists in speaking in riddles or being VERY BRITISH. How Nolan made three Batman films and never used the riddler I'll never understand.You won't care about a single character and the lead doesn't even get a name I'm guessing it's not important, but look bullets go backwards ""ohhhh ahhh"".The screenplay is awful. The sound and music are poorly done, half the time the music drowned out the dialogue and I hadn't a clue about what was going on.Kenneth Branagh I love the guy, but this isn't James Bond dial in the 20 minute dialogue of ""you'll never get away with this"" and ease up on the stereotypical European villain voice errghhh.Also one lead female character and she spends the movie being put to sleep when she asks too many questions or she's playing the damsel in distress and of course uses her sexuality to fool the baddies......errghhhhh Elizabeth Debicki deserves better!!!Anywho yeah I hated it, kill it with fire lol.",Tenet

However I look (or how much ever), the movie lacked a little to attain perfection. It lacks emotional connect. The factor that distinguishes great from good cinema. Tenet is great but won't be in any abstract list for best of all time.As for what works in it: everything else. Fast and tight script, beautiful cinematography, pulsating music, a big idea, cinematic thrills, novel presentation and good performances. All check. At times, it felt like the idea is too big for a 150 minute movie as major details are implications rather than scenes in screenplay (i do understand a major movie can't afford much). World here rather befits a mini series that explores and exploits the ideas raised here (Mr. Nolan, if you can hear me...). It's a non-stop heart pounding (brain pounding more like) ride jumping from a location to location, not letting you the agency of time to breathe. I just wished it had more emotional involvement with its cognitive high standard bench mark to fully hammer it home. Inception and Dark knight are greatest examples of this.It clearly seems like Mr. Nolan aimed for a cinematic experience like never before as opposed to a complete cinematic experience. In raising a bar high, he left another bar untouched which of adjusted a little would have made this is his possible best. It still is a bold move with original idea in a world of sequels and adaptations on rut. Actors are all aces and Nolan's direction is finer than ever (on par with his Dunkirk effort).I always admired screenwriter Nolan over director Nolan. His writing is ever surprising and most holistic. Guess, if his direction shines in this, as per universal rule, maybe we can't have all we want from screenplay then. For delivering higher levels of energy, it missed out on synergy.",Tenet

An identical thing happened with Tarantino and once upon a time in Hollywood.. My two favorite movie makers went nuts",Tenet
3389,ellisummers-69948,Block Fruster - Dissapointing Review Part I,2,3 September 2020,"In the following I would like to describe my impressions of the film tenet. I saw the film on August 26th. After the long break, I was very happy that finally a blockbuster was shown in the cinema again - and then Nolan! I was looking forward to intelligent, exciting entertainment with an innovative story.
I watched it at 3:00pm, there were about 16 people in the cinema. Although there were always 4 empty seats in between (?), the cinema was clearly empty. I felt a bit sorry for it, because with that few people you probably can't even really afford the maintenance costs. Maybe it was just too early in the day.
Now to the film.
Shortly to the boundary conditions, after Internet the film has an unbelievable budget of about 225 million dollars, so almost a quarter of a billion - and that's where the problem starts for me. With such a budget, there must be no logical errors. I have no problem if the story takes place in a fictional world, in which certain laws of nature are overridden, or if, for example, beings with ""superpowers"" exist, as long as they are comprehensible, with a certain motivation and behave within the limits of this world. If the chosen world is relatively ""normal"" in its physics, like here in tenet, then it is also the case, for example, that if a figure jumps from the third floor, it does not do so without violation of the rules, but breaks a foot. This is for me part of the inner logic of the world resp. of the event and is for me the part, which makes the event (within its laws) logical experienceable and realistic. Likewise the actions of the persons should fit to it, be it that they are driven to actions by external compulsions, self-preservation or due to predictable consequences.
The actions and the physical robustness of the characters do not fit into this framework for me at tenet. Here are two examples. In the opening scene, our protagonist has the task of bringing an object from an opera performance in Kiev and its bearer with his team to safety. The performance is attacked by terrorists who shoot wildly around the area. Shortly afterwards, the building is stormed by a special unit. He and his team join this special unit undercover (which felt that 2 minutes after the attack they were already on site and of course stormed the opera house immediately), reach their target and could bring it to safety. At the same time he notices that explosives are being laid out throughout the building. What does he do? He runs around to find the explosives, gets into a fight with the special unit and the terrorists and, thanks to the fact that the explosives have a digital display, he can throw them (10-12 pieces) into the upper, unoccupied ranks at the last second (about 2s before ignition), leave the building at the same time and watch the explosion while running out - and you can hardly believe that all this succeeds. For me this is not necessarily realistic, but rather cheap showmanship, also because of the countdown on the explosives. This copy has been seen in various films from my point of view much more gripping - even if perhaps not with the optical stimuli - the concert hall was already impressive.
Another example is the theft of Plutonium 241 from an armored convoy: police car in the front, armored car in the middle, police car in the back. His plan is to wedge the convoy between different trucks in the middle of the city highway, jump on the armored car and steal the Pt241. Now Pt241 is not a harmless thing in the described world, and the policemen or special agents who protected the convoy are certainly no beginners. But here, truck on the right, no reaction of the escorts, truck in front, no reaction of the escorts etc. . Probably their thoughts were: ""Oh, they are driving up close, and another one... they don't want to attack us. Nooo, but not here with us, we are in Tallin..."". That's just way too easy, and that doesn't really create any tension. Of course the action succeeds here as well. The accompanying policemen weren't even stupid ""First Order"" soldiers, but simply not present in the whole scene, no fight, no complication, nothing. Thrill potential somewhere around minus 1.
For me, the portrayal of the ""super agent"" in the film called the protagonist was also quite difficult. After the action with the opera he gets into the hands of some enemies and is interrogated. Why this happens at a freight yard makes sense to somebody, if only because of the beautiful pictures. Anyway, he sits on a chair, his teeth are pulled out and at the last moment he catches a deadly capsule, swallows it to escape interrogation and then, bang, blinds and he wakes up in a sick bay on a ship. How? No information about this. And the best: ""by the way, we have also re-inserted your teeth..."". Okay, makes sense. Not that implants can take half a year, but maybe it was only the cash and the third parties.
It's just these cross-fades, hero in greatest need, actually death, and bang, he is saved, that make it difficult for me to build up tension or to feel it, because he is saved by Deus Ex Machina again and again. Another example: Car total crash, he burns, he should actually burn (or freeze to death with the inverse logic), and in the next scene he lies in the infirmary and is saved - good thing, because otherwise the movie would already be over. But suspense works differently. These jumps make the ""experience"" of the film and especially the excitement quite difficult or impossible for me, because nothing happens to it.
Or, to stay with the example above with the armored car, it jumps onto the roof, blows a hole through the steel and jumps inside. The plutonium is stored in another armored cabinet and what does the agent do: blow up, it worked just as well, it probably works here in the armored car as well, maybe 2 meters on 3 meters , steel around the outside, so a short explosive charge is attached, a little bit backed up, ignited, ... and of course it worked fine. No eardrum injury, eyes, hands and above all teeth still there. Either there is a physics in the film, then hold out, or there is just not, then we write Jumanji on it and well. For me this is not very realistic and a spoilsport.
Especially the things shown above are technical weaknesses for me, which should not occur with such a big budget.
People
On the one hand we have the evil adversary:
A Russian oligarch. He comes from a poor background. He has worked his way up and is also an arms dealer. He has a quite good infrastructure with trained combat teams and a yacht. The only bad thing is that he is terminally ill. His goal is to wipe out the entire world population, which is about 7.7 billion people. The motivation is for me absolutely unclear in the dimension. If I see it correctly, the motivation built up in the film is something like this: his wife wants to leave him and it is important for him that no one else gets her (i.e. kill her, which was not so obvious to me in the film, at least there were scenes that showed a different picture for me), then he is terminally ill, so he can't ""own"" the world any longer and so the conclusion from the first one: best would be to destroy the world, so that no one else lives either. Okay, take a deep breath, think, aha, supermotivation! For me this makes absolutely no sense, the motivation of Thanos is even more insightful (even if it was already moderately weak).
His wife, an art historian by profession and by the way quite unhappy with him so that she would like to separate from him. For me she still has a psychopathic disposition, because she cheats him out of 12 million dollars and tries to kill him on one or the other occasion. Probably with wealthy parents, otherwise studying as an art historian would not make sense. And it is just the woman for whom our secret agent endangers the mission several times and thus 7.7 billion people.
With the vita and motivation for the top villain probably not even The Asylum would have given money for a movie. To call the whole thing clichéd characters would be a pure understatement for me and wouldn't really do justice to it.
And there we are at the secret agent. His job is to prevent the end of the world in a secret organization. If I as a viewer want to be part of a film, the protagonist has to suffer. You have to feel his pain almost vividly yourself. Just like the world is coming to an end, he must also come to an end. For me, that makes the film, the characters, tangible. But here it is different. After the ""resurrection"", a scientist tells him: ""There is time travel, and by the way, the world is also coming to an end..."". His reaction is: ""ah, o.k., yes, yawn..."" - somewhere between indifference and disinterest. Rather beside it than only with it. What do I care about the world shown - and for me as a viewer it was the same when it goes under, so what?
An emotional connection with the people, with the world never came up for me. You have to imagine when you receive such information. How it can torture you, how you can deal with it, etc., that could have given depth, but none of this in the film. Unfortunately, this goes on throughout the film. I never had an emotional connection with the protagonist. The super scientist didn't seem to be the brightest either. Because the protagonist had to give her the tip to examine the metal of the bullets to find out who made them. Actually, I would have thought that when it comes to the mission (extinction of mankind), a highly specialized scientific/military/state team would have to work together. But apparently nothing, on the contrary the secret agent is told several times that he actually lacks experience. So it seems to me that it makes sense to entrust him with the rescue of the world - actually it is rather like this, that when a blind man follows the other blind man, both of them fall into the pit.",Tenet
3390,ellisummers-69948,Block Fruster - Dissapointing Review Part II,2,3 September 2020,"The scheme of the film was more or less the same: mission, dialogue, mission, dialogue, mission... (or first dialogue then mission...). However, the dialogues were so meaningless that they were of no use except for time consumption. They didn't really get you anywhere, they were too empty and flat for that. The missions on the other hand were quite strange for me. Mission: I want to break into a warehouse. What to do (and what is most complicated?). I hijack a plane of the tax authorities (?), which is transporting tons of gold, and race into the warehouse. Does that make sense? No, not really, but it makes action. And the best thing is, in the movie it's no problem, no difficulties, stupid guards, no obstacles. Capturing an airplane, that's something I can do. The main thing is a few nice effects.
When things got tight, there was always a door opening somewhere (example ship: door to the engine room...). It was a bit like having an unemotional artist on a wire rope, secured with a thick rope and you know exactly that when he falls nothing happens to him. There was just no tension. Also, to break the circle by simply cutting the safety line in the film, that was probably too much to ask. The film could not offer that.
What was it like in the movie? The secret agent had just stolen the plutonium. The oligarch comes along in another car and brings his wife with him. There is a car chase on the highway until both vehicles are speeding along side by side. What does the oligarch do? He says I would like the plutonium (which is actually part of a secret code / algorithm), otherwise I will kill the woman I brought with me. And what does the secret agent do (it's all about humanity), oh yes, no problem here it is (o.k. in reality the suitcase was empty, but so what). How he then stops the other car (it is speeding towards the end of a traffic jam), you have to have seen - and if you are honest with yourself, you would have to leave the cinema afterwards. What would Lt. Col. Devoe have done in this situation? - and it was all about a few cheap nuclear missiles.
The story itself is even more challenging for me. In the future, a scientist invents a way to travel back in time. She realizes that the invention might not be that good after all, she splits it into 9 parts (the codes / algorithms), sends it back in time and the goal is to find the parts again and unite them so that the world can end. And this is on the initiative of the future population, which holds the current population responsible for the exploitation of the world and for all environmental damage. Aha. But somehow this is not unknown to me, so somehow between Terminator, a quota scientist (wasn't there a scientist responsible for the quantum weapon in Mortal Engines too?) and Aquaman, where the underwater inhabitants wanted to defend themselves against the destruction of the environment, to name a few current ones,... I don't want to talk about the splitting into 9 fragments or parts (Infinity stones, various mummy movies etc.). Wouldn't it have been easier to destroy the thing right in the future?
I have already mentioned the rather emotionless behaviour of the main character several times. In contrast, the super agent James Bond is a universe of character. You have to keep in mind that the movie cost almost a quarter of a billion dollars, but it is also a Nolan movie. Mother/son - secret agent - villain and a little bit of end of the world. Somehow I can think of comparisons with certain ""low budget"" movies with a similar setting, ""Reset"", a Chinese film with mother/daughter and time loop from 2017. A typical Chinese film, with pathos, exaggeration. IMDb somewhere around 5. If you ignore the first 5 minutes and watch the next 30, it was somehow more coherent in the plot than tenet and (at least in the time I watched it - o.k. I watched it completely) picked me up emotionally better. Even though the main actress suddenly has no problem handling a pistol. Whereby, tenet has also shown that an art historian makes a good assassin (don't get the idea that this is not realistic!). Or even mother/daughter in ""Hai Phuong"", 2019, Vietnam, especially the last half hour has carried me away more than tenet did. It is all about emotions! And, to exaggerate if you like musicals, I found Rocky Handsome, 2016, somehow more impressive (even if he didn't get the best reviews), this time not mother/daughter, but ""father""/daughter and a remake at the same time. What I wanted to say with the examples, there are other filmmakers who are not the highly praised ""masterminds"", who at least in a small way, make films that are interesting for me (and they don't have to be available in E). And yes, I was unfair to the films with ""cheap (low budget) home movies"" - I liked them.
But back to tenet. What exactly the codes / algorithms were and what they could do remained in the dark. I could have said heretical now, since the film would have had to explain something. Also the story (actually a side story) with the 12 million painting (which felt like ¼ of the film) remained rather unclear for me, since it did not advance the story from my point of view. The other actors also remained rather pale for me. They had no background story and therefore no ""life"", one could just as well have used wooden figures, they were just there.
Actually the end scene could have been a highlight. With forward/backward actions. In a deserted former Russian secret town. But for me it was not. The city looked very different from the way you know Russian cities from documentaries (Oil-City was even more tangible, lovingly and real for me), on the other hand the soldiers ran for miles on open space, and there were also soldiers from the enemy, although a bomb was supposed to explode in a few minutes. The fights themselves were difficult for me to describe as such. In another recession, they were compared to paintball games, and yes, that's what I like best. It had more of a game character than a real fight.
And then, just before the end, the bad guy (or one of his employees) almost wins, just one more push of a button - and what happens, the thing jams, not just once or twice. This of course gives the hero the opportunity to turn the whole thing around! How nice. That was a real low point in the film for me. I'm sorry, for a film with the resume and the budget these are things I can't forgive. That was just weak for me.
The running gag, ""who recruited you?"", fitted for me to the level of the film (in the sense of an innovative story) - ""who is Sophie Neveu?"", for me it wasn't funny, but at best it was a copy of another film - and by the way, he, the protagonist, will play an important role in the future, he just doesn't know it yet. Have you ever heard it somewhere else?
Some topics were just illogical for me. The film represented the thesis, or rather showed that the ""grandfather paradox"" doesn't exist, i.e. you could erase yourself or your ancestor and didn't have to worry about yourself (unless you meet yourself in the past, then that's not good - with exceptions, fighting against yourself is possible). This means that you can create infinite clones of yourself or the algorithm components with the ""back machines"" that seem to be standing around every street corner (both the bad guy and the ""good"" secret organization had some). With a little thought, this could have made the whole thing much easier. And actually, ""Dark"" with its inner logic and the motivations of the actors (including their emotions) seems to me almost like a revelation in comparison. Also it was not so clear to me, why the future population wanted to completely wipe out the current one, wouldn't targeted interventions in history be more effective?
So what is my conclusion?
A brief summary of the history: Evil Russian oligarch with a difficult childhood and a psychotic woman who wants to kill him has the desire to destroy the world because he himself is terminally ill and therefore cannot own the world, or if he is dead, no one else should live either (yes, it is really as outrageous as it sounds). Fortunately, there is a good western (quota) black secret agent, who prevents this almost single-handedly. Actually a pearl of storytelling, because it has already proven itself a hundred times in other films. That would probably be too much copy, so we take a ""time-back machine"", even if it has no real use and it's not explained, but it's different then and gives some nice effects. When I think of how many highly paid and creative screenwriters have probably been involved. It probably would have been better to have spent 3-4 thousand dollars more on a decent script, but with all the action, you didn't have any money left.
The story has considerable logic holes for me, the motivation and the character drawing of the villain is not comprehensible or mature at all for me. The story itself has for me one or the other (rather more than less) borrowings from other films and, in order not to make it too difficult for the secret agent, many coincidences that prevent the worst from happening. For me, that is simply far too little for a film with these boundary conditions. Even for an Asylum film (if it had received a production release with the setting at all) it would not even be mediocre for me. Therefore 3 out of 10 .
Nevertheless it is currently the only block fruster. So go to the cinema, if necessary with a sleep mask and earplugs, but go!",Tenet
3391,nathanjcarpenter-70529,Great Sci-fy Spy Thriller,9,6 September 2020,"I had very high expectations for the movie, and it did not disappoint. The casting and performances are 10/10. Washington nails the lead role while Pattinson and Debicki are great as supporting characters. Branagh plays an intimidating villain. Additionally, the score is captivating and well-crafted. One of the few I immediately purchased on iTunes.
The cinematography and action scenes are the best parts of the movie, especially the plane, truck, and third act scenes. You can really appreciate all the work it took to shoot these scenes practically, and it pays off. The plot is complex and multi-layered. This may not appeal to all movie-goers, but it means that repeat viewings will benefit one's understanding and enjoyment of the film. I have seen the movie twice, and enjoyed it even more the second time.
I would have liked to have seen more humor and depth to the characters, but this is a relatively minor complaint for me. The sound mixing on my first viewing was not good, I could barely understand much of the dialogue, but my second viewing at the same theater did not have this issue.
This movie is 9/10 for me. I would stop short of calling it perfect, but I will definitely be revisiting it for years to come. Tenet succeeds as an epic spy-thriller with the added sci-fy elements that Nolan is famous for. Excellent!",Tenet
3392,freddyleyton,Confused,4,20 October 2020,"I'm a Christopher Nolan fan and love his movies but Tenet is way too complicated to be ""fun"". Plot was all over the place and it was hard to keep up...if you wanna watch it wait till it's on Netflix.",Tenet
3393,neilchurcher,Movie making that taxes our ability to comprehend what we are seeing,10,5 September 2020,"I can see how difficult it is for Nolan to imagine what watching Tenet is like for the viewer. It's hard to listen to because the dialog has no clarity either sonically or in explanation. It's hard to follow because things that are happening in the film simultaneously are more visually and sequentially complex than we expect to process at any one time. These things seem of no consequence to Nolan because he has not made a movie based on how you would normally make a movie, a movie that has a plot and moves forwards and reveals itself. Nolan is pre-occupied, rather like an astronaut rapidly leaving Earth's atmosphere and too busy entering space to concern himself with us terrestrial beings. Too busy transcending movie making into a newer art form that manages the density and complexity of his evolved storytelling. Nolan is perfecting how film itself can manage stories in new ways.This I imagine, is why the movie on first watch is un-interpretable. It's not been designed to be seen as we currently view movies. Upon realising this at some point during the movie, I gave up trying to comprehend it in full and just started watching it as a display of events. And what Nolan has achieved in film is by using the properties of film in itself. Its ability to run backwards. Watching Tenet is like watching a movie play out in real time, but with another movie with the same plot that has been filmed backwards, then with both movies spliced together. We are literally watching two versions of a story going in opposite directions because the medium of film can literally do that, even if the result over-taxes on your ability to comprehend it in a single take.And this is the genius of Tenet. Film can be made backwards and forwards in the same way we can watch it again and again, backwards and forwards. The storyline and plot allow this to occur and our main enjoyment of this movie is that this can occur. There is in the story a homage to The Spierig Brothers' Predestination, where a model of time plays out to display the full consequences that time can have on our lives when time is no longer linear. But make no mistake, this movies plot is just a vehicle for Nolan to re-configure how the making and playing of movies itself can be changed. Moviemaking at its finest.",Tenet
3394,Rebeccajoo,concept,7,5 September 2020,"In fact, it's not difficult to understand. I think of Liu Cixin's short story. It also conceives the backwardness of the physical theorem of time-space consistency. The concept is greater than the story. As for the movie ""tenet ,"" the physical law crushes the world, and the plot is greater Everything, everyone is so hurried and so small, without life and character, as well a beginning as well a change, the starting point and the ending point are mutually cause and effect, bringing grand experience to the audience, fascinating people to think about the present and the future, but this The creation is accompanied by the sinking of the ceiling of the actors in Nolan's movies. The only thing that reflects the characteristics of the actor is Debicki's long legs: the rear seat is locked, and the others have little room for display from beginning to end. The runners walk and talk. , Sitting and threatened by others...The grand scene and the compact narrative but the details are not rigorous, there are several bugs",Tenet

The movie is EXTREMELY confusing with the whole future to past time traveling. My friends and I went to watch at the theatre and we all had to read the plot online because we were just so confused about what happened. Once you read the synopsis the storm in your mind cleared up a little and now all of the questions roll in; if the past characters unknowingly saw their future selfs then the whole movie just repeats itself and it becomes an endless loop, if people from the future hid the ""bomb"" in 9 different places to prevent a world war in the past?? HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? wouldn't the war already have happened?????????
But I have to say the effects are very well done and the acting is quite good
Overall, would I recommend this movie? Yes and no, here's why; if you're looking for a movie to watch just for fun without looking at it with a critical eye then sure, go for it. But if you're looking for something to watch where you want to know in details what happened and actually learn something, you're in wrong placeThank you for reading my ted talk",Tenet

His previous works are among my favourite films of all time; Interstellar, Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION!But this movie is different. Nolan ordinarily blends heart pumping action with deep, emotional storylines. You WANT Cobb to get back to his kids, you're heartbroken for Murph when her dad leaves, you're thrilled at the big reveal in The Prestige. Tenet? I just didn't care.There's very little dialogue here, and so much of it is inaudible, I didn't really connect with the characters at all.I think Nolan got excited with this movie. He clearly has a penchant for exploring paradoxes and other dimensions, but normally they're well explained during calm moments. Again, despite a few bits of dialogue, those calm moments of clarity are missing from Tenet.It made me think of a few other movies that I didn't really connect with emotionally at a character level, and they all have one thing in common. They were books first.I love to read, but occasionally when I don't get a movie, someone will say to me; ""I know what you mean, but if you read the book it will make a lot more sense.""I fear this is what happened here. Nolan had the story mapped out to perfection in his head no doubt, but it just didn't come across on film for me, it's a mess.As ironic as it sounds, maybe someone can go and write a book called Tenet - and posthumously revive this movie so people can connect the dots and love the characters. It would be a nice bonus if some of the convoluted concepts in the movie are also addressed in the amount of detail that is required to make this movie enjoyable. As I said, ironically, maybe we can then we can go back and watch the movie from another perspective.",Tenet

Thirty minutes in it's getting harder to follow but any time soon all will be made clear. An hour in ""I would be impressed if this will all make sense any time sooner or later"". One and a half hour later my brain gave up trying to make any sense of it all but ""the end of the movie is probably near"". This torture remains for faaaaaaar to long.

This movie isn't for everyone.This movie is for people who like to watch a movie more than one time and for people who don't mind using their brain during a movie. I meet both of those criteria.TENET is a blockbuster for the ages. It contains all the elements that make a great Christopher Nolan movie: good acting, good music score, and a well-written story. This movie would not work without a tightly written story. Chris doesn't want you to enjoy the movie, he wants you to be a part of the movie. He wants you to say ""What am I missing? This is so confusing.""That way, you can go back and watch it again and again and see the elements coalesce into one incredible story!

3417,debbierufus,All the excitement of a Rubik's cube with as much depth,4,24 September 2020,"The appreciation of Nolan's films is fast turning into a Pavlovian cult, with his fans convinced that even a film as monumentally bad as Tenet is a masterpiece.It is not that the plot is complex. There is logic to the time loop plotting. The problem is that plot mechanics do not on their own make for great storytelling. Other more conventional things like character development, wit, scene structure, humour and coherent action have value.I liked Dunkirk. That is where his penchant for cross-cutting (and apparent fear of linear sustained scene building) came into its own.

In most films this would not be a problem, but this is a Nolan film and words count. Now the positives, this a bombastic mix of action and physics.

Story as always so pure with lots of science behind it. I saw this movie twice even with fear of COVID but finally helped me to understand most of it but still there is things I didn't get them.

Tenet is no doubt, a film that you need to see in cinemas if you are interested. It reaches that level of an experience on a technical level that no TV in the universe could do it justice. At first I liked its plot, it was a bit confusing but relatively simple, but at the movie goes on it starts throwing in more stuff that it does get convoluted and hard to follow (Maybe that was the intention idk). Not to mention there are a ton of of plot questions that arent answered, unless I missed something. My only other complaint is that the main 2 characters are dry and forgettable, the villain was intimidating enough though. Those are pretty much my only complaints. The action is immaculate, the camerawork is great and never has any shaky cam, the acting is decent, the writing is a lot of exposition but it keeps it entertaining by having the dialogue be fast and quick since the movie is very fast paced, and the soundtrack was a loud of bass which can get annoying but the instruments were great and the music fit the film very well and epicly. Overall, I really recommend seeing this film for all of that!",Tenet

3432,pavik-07189,One of the best films of 2020...,10,8 December 2020,"This film is not for general audiences and TENET is very much complicated, so I had to see this film a couple of times. This film is a bit underrated by critics and other reviewers and I am pretty sure that the people who rated it below 8 are not familiar with the physics involved in this film and most probably trying to find the definition of 'entropy'.So, I will be pointing out the pros and cons of this filmPros: All the actors have done a fantastic job. This kind of film needs intensive amount of planning and precision which is done fabulously. The background score is good. It is the screenplay that makes the film more interesting. The ideas used in this film are much more complicated than his other films. One of the scene which happens in Tallinn, Estonia is a major plot of the film which needs intense planning and editing which is done superbly by the team.Cons: The sound mixing in this film is not done well, watching with subtitles will be preferable, I sometimes feel that the background score over dominates the dialogues in some major scenes which makes it difficult for us to focus on the dialogues. You have to watch the film twice (or may be thrice) to fully understand and grasp the concept behind the film.Except for these things, the film looks alright to me, if you think the film is confusing as hell then try watching it again.
Thus, this film is worth watching.",Tenet

At first watch the could lead to confusion after 1.5 hours,but watching it second time and neatly would give you a brief idea about what exactly the game is all about.

3447,johnsgchurchill,A great concept marred by bad sound editing and leading man,6,11 December 2020,"Near the climax of this movie, I thought about how much effort went into turning a complex story into a movie. There are so many details to keep track of and they generally pulled it off, with a few tropes.
However.
In the end, it wasn't the technicals or special effects or even camera work - the things I'd consider most challenging in producing a movie - that made it a less than memorable movie, but three things that seem much more banal.I'll keep this short and list them. Since I'm revealing spoilers, I assume you've seen the movie already.1. Terrible sound, both in picking up spoken words and post-production sound editing. There are many scenes with conversations that are key to understanding the story. But the actors seem to be mumbling while turned away from microphones. I had to keep rewinding the betamax, and even then I sometimes had to give up and try and figure it out by watching what came next. Worse, the background music, which sounds more like a videogame's, was at the same volume as the speaking. Whoever did the sound needs to to watch every Tarantino movie and pay attention to how conversations are put front and center.2. Bad casting. I don't know the lead actor who plays ""protagonist"". I certainly don't know his strange, painted-on beard. I understand, Denzel Washington was probably busy. But damn, he would have been great in this role (provided everyone could hear what he is saying).3. Illogical chemistry. A major plot device is the care the protagonist has for Kat and his willingness to risk everything for just the possibility of saving her. It makes no sense.There are, of course, many other issues with the plot and the odd doomsday device they take apart at the end. The first two issues are preventable and would have given the most bang for the buck, possibly raising the average score of this movie above 8.",Tenet

Sound design is terrible, you can barely understand the dialogue without subtitles, and given how complex of a movie this is, it's inexcusable.Overall plot was pretty good, but it seemed compacted, like it could've made more sense in a longer movie. Overcomplicated films that only make sense in the last ten minutes is what Nolan does best, but after watching Tenet, it never ended up making sense afterwards either.The characters are pretty mediocre, no real depth to them, and the film never really has time to develop them properly. Fight choreography is pretty good, but could definitely be improved by a better sound design team.A decent movie if you're prepared to go back and rewatch afterwards, but by far not Nolan's greatest work.",Tenet

I wouldn't say this is his best film (Inception still holds that honor) but I still very much loved it. One of his most ambitious releases and the cinematography is incredible. All of the acting is solid and the musical score is amazing and really adds to the overall experience. Wish I had the chance to see it in theaters but still fun to watch from home.

3464,c76_MhQxb6a7i6P8gokZHlnV,"Action and satisfying twists on the first watch, character depth, even more twists and a satisfactorily complete level of understanding on later ones",10,4 January 2021,"I've watched it two times so far, with no intent of ending the cycle of rewatches anytime soon. The first time was in English and with a friend, the second one in my mother tongue German and with my father.I have heard English-speaking people say that the mixing was off. While I do agree that the speech was hard to understand at times (and that this is obviously less pronounced in dubbed versions), I do not think that this is a problem with the audio. I was watching on a stereo setup with the downmix assuming correlated sound sources for the speakers (so 3dB quieter dialogue than usual on most consumer stereo setups) and when the actors on screen had masks on for short parts of it at the beginning, we could not understand all of what was being said. This was especially bad, because some of it were secret codes, so one could not infer all of the exact words, much less understand the meaning even if one did. When revisiting Tenet, I was able to understand the dialogue thanks to the context given by the first watch. This seems very much intentional, as the significance of the events at the start of the film is only ever revealed at the end of it, or at least forgivable, as it doesn't require a complete memory of the dialogue to be understood.When watching the movie for a second time, I had time to focus on more than just enjoying the action and twists, but actually think through if they made sense - which they do for the most part within the bounds of the rules established by the film - and appreciate the - sufficiently present for some, plentifully for other characters - amount of character depth. Most of the questions I had the first time around were answered. The plot is so dense and complicated that it requires some thought to explore the meaning of what is going on and provides interest for multiple viewings.At points there are lines that border on being what you'd expect from a typical blockbuster: Sensational and artificially dramatic clichés such as this unloquacious exchange: ""Nuclear holocaust?"" - ""No. Something worse"". But these are few and far in between and even fitting with the gravity of threat and the sometimes cynical (justifiably so), sometimes hopeful atmosphere. At times the dialogue seems like a metacommentary or the director talking directly to the viewer through a character: ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it"". While these moments provoked some laughs in us, they do not seriously stifle the perceived seriousness of the story. Especially so, since it is not at cheap attempt to draw away from there not being anything to be understood here, as quite the contrary is the case.Some criticisms like Kat's motivation - her son - not even being granted a close-up, the stakes only ever becoming palpable later in the story and the protagonist not even carrying a name apart from just that descriptor - ""Protagonist"" - I find to be reasonable, but not necessarily things that detract from the films quality, unless, of course, one is always watching with the mindset of a movie critic comparing this film to your run-of-the-mill 2010s blockbuster, like even I find myself doing sometimes - maybe to my own detriment. Because, while the mentioned points of criticisms are common predictors of poor moviemaking, they don't necessarily prove its presence on a case-by-case basis, and in this one, they're part of the realistic way of perceiving events this film expects from their viewers, missing details, not being omniscient and not possessing the mental flexibility to understand everything right away. You learn with the protagonist and you are equally confused. It is still fun even if you don't understand it, but it is also divisive, because if you happen to miss a crucial detail or misunderstand something, which is quite easy to do at the rate the plot is developing and subverting and omitting common techniques like establishing shots at, you might be unable to suspend your disbelief, as has happened to some movie critics I follow, watching its entirety through that lens and refusing it a second chance. With a movie about time, it is obvious that some compromises with the laws of physics may have to be made for the story to work. And if something does not make sense at first, one might put it down to that and be unable to enjoy the rest of the movie, less than someone who is just here for the action or didn't happen to misunderstand and sees that specific detail as an emergent property of the films universe. But one thing I can assure you: As someone who is generally somewhat adverse to the idea of superhero films and only rarely able to enjoy films of that variety, which often employ logic incompatible with the real world just like Tenet, even I was able to enjoy the twisted physics. And this is for one simple reason: They are fairly consistent, at least to the point where there are no obvious fallacies that would have struck me without me scribbling away on a notepad, looking to find them. Most things that seem fishy at first can be explained away with the established logic and are believable during the runtime until you later follow the logic back to the point where the laws of this universe differ from ours and everything falls apart, a fact one will have to be able to ignore to enjoy this story, and the things that had to be made compromises on (e.g. gravity) are at least acknowledged in the film.
There are some themes from Interstellar that make an appearance in this film. One of importance to the plot and I'm sure problematic for those who had a hard time suspending their disbelief with that film is the idea of things existing in this current moment having been set up by people in the future. If this is a cop-out you'll have to decide for yourself as with all of this film's ambivalent qualities. ""We live in a twilight world"" after all and it's not as easy as one detail making or breaking a film. :)This film is one of extremes and seeming contradictions, and I can understand the common criticisms towards it as well as the sentiment that this is ""the most Nolan movie ever"". But most of that does not bother me with this movie or only makes it more interesting: Even though it is stated by a character in the movie that ""What's happened's happened."", not only is there always cast a little bit of doubt on determinism being the nature of the universe, it is also the journey that counts. Tenet has a decent soundtrack, great even if not standing on its own but looked at in the context of what it can do for the mood of the film, has great action scenes that are recontextualized later in the movie and are even more enjoyable for it, a plot that is best understood by means of multiple viewings and a drawn timeline but still sufficiently catchy if one is just looking for excitement, emotional depth for every character, locomotorily demanding and emotionally nuanced performances, a fitting cast, a new perspective comparable with being through another than the initial protagonist's eyes on your first rewatch and an amazing atmosphere with the same color palette and switching aspect ratios from Interstellar. It does not hold back or provide obvious flashbacks so you won't miss a twist and it does not explain all the events that occur on screen, some is left up for interpretation. It is a film probably best suited for a somewhat more, but not relentlessly and unimaginatively scrutinizing audience and those who are willing to devote the time to watching it twice. This movie is one of a bunch that put a wide grin of awe at how the writer could make such an intricate, farfetched situation seem believable on my face, and one of a handful that has ever instilled that desire in me to watch it multiple times, even immediately consecutively.",Tenet
3465,adityamagdum-08000,Nolan's Student Project....,9,8 January 2021,"After delivering multiple memorable films to the audience, Nolan finally crafts his student project which he cherished to make for so long; 10 years to be precise.The idea of the movie according to him arose in his mind when he was intrigued in the occurrence of the reversing of a gunshot from his first movie Memento. The ideas, finally processed into his latest feature film look so fresh and amazing.Some films are those of a kind in which the audience should get themselves ready to watch it. This is exactly that kind of movie. The opening sequence are so bombastic and engaging that it requires to pay attention to minute details and keep up with the pace of the movie.The cast is limited but so wonderfully assigned that each of them look their part without any exaggeration. The only lacking factor for me as for others also who pointed out, were the connect been them.Hans Zimmer's absence was briliantly replaced by Ludwig Gõrransson's thundering and engaging score. Each note and beat makes the theatre shudder with the reverberation. The editing also feels crisp giving the storytelling a smooth and a natural pace.But the X-factor of this movie is the collaboration between Christopher Nolan, Hoyte Van Hoytema and Nathan Crowley. Nolan as the screenplay writer aces the dialogues keeping it subtle and short. Hoytema wonderfully captures each frame with pinpoint accuracy and towering visuals. Nathan Crowley simply astounds you with the gigantic and definitive set pieces that are crucial for the plot.The ideas of Nolan may somehow seem compromised with the ending as the studio had changed it along with the structuring of the film owing to increased run time and the ongoing pandemic. But this one remains a technical masterpiece yet, showcasing Nolan's forte in the field of filmmaking.",Tenet

Pattinson has clearly matured into a handsome action star... he was far too angular - weird, far too long in his troubled teen roles. Washington is not particularly pretty but certainly handsome enough to capture millennial female's fantasies. Trouble is, whomever follows Daniel Craig will suffer from comparisons. Just as after Connery, Craig had to overcome by adopting a harder persona, the next bond is going to have to step up the violence in order to overcome Craig's hard shell (but vulnerable) leading man. Cubbie's wife did the Bond franchise no favors by ordering Craig to pitch the gun off the bridge. He should have shot off an ear or finger to maintain his ""cruel credibility""..",Tenet

It's truthfully one of the best movies I've watched in the last decade and I feel that the reason for lower ratings than expected was simply due to people not understanding what Nolan was trying to do.

Some viewers may be displeased at some of the rather unrealistic dialogue choices some characters make.

This feels more like a James Bond movie with a time-travel element added to it.Effects are done well, technically the movie is very well made. But it feels a bit over the top, almost Michael Bay-like at times.Acting ranges from excellent to okay, the script doesn't help in this case but the actors do a good job considering.

I was constantly trying to figure out what was going on and who I was suppose to focus on with the storyline. I was having issues with what was a flashback and what was in ""real"" time, since it was setup like it should have been. I am sorry to say, But Mr. Nolan has not made a good film that I have seen. Maybe a acquired taste, but if you want action, fine. If you want drama, fine. But quit being a jack of all trades and concentrate on one subject and do it well.

First the positives - the cinematography and colors were excellent. There is a certain grandeur to the film, that makes you realize this is in fact a big budget film.
And, of course the mind-bending inversion concept, kinda takes the sci-fi bread/butter theme, time-travel, to a new level. This was refreshing.
The negatives - Music was just annoying, to say the least. Unnecessarily loud, and distracting. I really think the matured compositions of Zimmer would have made the viewing much palatable than it is now. Casting and acting were meh. Anyone else could have acted here. It doesn't matter. The characters were all one-dimensional, giving them hardly any room for ""acting"". Nothing special about the lines and dialogues, they were very rudimentary. Other than the prior knowledge that i was watching a film made by Christopher Nolan i had nothing else going for me. I just wasn't invested in the story, even though the inversion concept blew my mind, with the entropy and what-not. It would have helped to understand the complications of this better, we needed someone like DiCaprio talking us through the various levels of this mind-bending mess. Overall- the movie completely lacks emotion, and soul, for the lack of a better word.A movie, at the basic level, should be made to entertain. Tenet failed me here.

Not much decoding needed as his previous. It's a clean narrative if you listen carefully. After years, this could be one of the easy movies of Nolan on par with Memento. Most critics complained about the muffled conversations and too loud bgm. With subtitles, those weren't an issue.The action sequences are mind boggling and brilliant! You will know why Nolan was adamant to give the theatrical experience to his audience.Nolan doesn't put a 'I am brilliant' show-off as some say. He is serious trying to explore his endurance and advance his own previous leaps. We just need to let our ego to accept 'Yes, he is brilliant and an innovator'. Still a tough competitor for my favorite Dennis Villeneuve. To sum up, keep aside the early critics - Tenet, is a good one.Those who don't have the habit of keen observation and to think back & forth can avoid this movie. For others, its a visual and cognitive treat.",Tenet

If it was released amongst others as usual, it will have been a 6 star movie. But being released in 2020, expectations were lowered to match the times. This is not an Inception or Dark Knight level of movie, you have to rewatch it to fully appreciate it and understand it.There is not enough drama to be attached to any character or understand the decisions they make. Furthermore, there are completely pointless scenes like the sail boat race/murder scene, which has very little dialogue or impact on the story and adds more to the unnecessary amount of cutaways. i.e Container, Prya in Oslo, Wind Turbine and SIR Michael Cane.The part I found fundamentally flawed was the heat transfer. NOT for the reasons a physicist would explain, but in terms of; if heat transfer can be inverted, then an inverted nuclear weapon will reduce global warming and radiation and cause almost no harm to us if used correctly. So why not fix global warming with inverted nukes instead of killing us????It is a must watch movie, a great idea that deserves a sequel to cover-up the plot holes and an opportunity to right the wrongs.",Tenet

My brain wouldn't have had the neural patterns to grasp the ideas as soon as they're shown. Thanks Brian Greene.Watching this move is like listening to an intricate symphony. If you're expecting something out of the ordinary, it won't touch you. Perhaps action scenes are just enough for you, and this movie is masterful at that. But then you're missing a whole hidden dimension of entertainment.Or like a painting that can mean just lines and colors to some, but deep, meaningful stories and emotions to others, depending on how you perceive the world.The movie is an excellent expression of an extremely complicated and counterintuitive physics concept, and understanding it as you watch it is absolutely delicious. It's like Inception for adults.Around 2005 Nolan explained in an interview the passage of time in Memento, drawing a curved line to explain that that movie presented intercalated scenes showing past and future events only to culminate at the point where both past and future collide, the present (search on YouTube, it's interesting to see his drawing and perception of time). Watching this movie feels like he wanted to have that same dynamic but without intercalated scenes, past and present shown simultaneously, and then he just needed a script to fill in for that. I think he managed it masterfully.This film is not a 10 because the audio was as uncompressed as it can get, with low volume in some parts, to which you then increase the volume, just to be followed by a very high explosion. I guess that would work better in the cinema, but it was not good on my TV.One of the best movies I've ever watched.",Tenet

3560,migsch26-124-118369,Amazing. Confusing. Dejected.,7,14 December 2020,"This being a Christopher Nolan film one can expect amazing set pieces, confusing conceptual time references and the hope that the film leaves you satisfied with the time spent watching a visual masterpiece. Unfortunately, it is the last one that lets it down. The initial pace of this film is brilliant with a practically non stop sequence right from the get go and segues swiftly on to the premise of the film, the time entropy in which items, timelines and ultimately the future can be ""reversed"". This bit, while intriguing at first, tends to go as fast as the opening and I found it hard to keep up. While the cast of characters is well selected the only role I thought should have gone to another actor was of Sator, the Russian oligarch. There are plenty better villains out there than Ken Brannagh and for me he just didn't resonate with the character. The whole ""reversing time"" sequences sometimes felt that the director had seen some cool footage of explosions backwards so kept throwing them in here and there which, for me, sometimes felt unnecessary and gratuitous irregardless of their technical mastery. As mentioned, the pace of the film is good and it is a fantastic homage to the spy thriller genre but even with all the ""time travel"" concepts and funky backwards footage it is basically about saving the world... which isn't exactly original, is it? It's a good film, with amazing set pieces, can be as confusing as much as how far you want to get in to the concept but in the end leaves you somewhat dejected that after two and a half hours all you've watched is some guys try to stop a bomb.",Tenet

The fact that I never watch any trailers to keep myself in mystery and this being the first film I was able to see with my friends after a long time took my expectations and my excitement to the Zenith !As a plot heavy film with beautiful visuals, action sequences and top notch acting from the cast (didn't expect so many actors from order of phoenix to be in this film) the film doesn't disappoint what Nolan fans have come to expect. But there are a lot of glaring issues that needs introspection.1) First, many of friends and myself included felt the sound effects and background score subdued voice and it was considerably harder to discern.2) Scene transitions were less fluidic. The protagonist jumps from one location to another in a fleeting instance. (no, this is not related to plot or time inversion)3) Expository scenes intended to explain audiences of critical points felt very rushed.4) I felt Nolan chose to cop-out whenever there was something abstract/difficult to explain, similar to ""they"" in interstellarConclusion - You will scratch your heads !

Keep it coming.I am impressed by David John Washington! I'd like to see more of his work, we have a new star that can carry a movie.I also like this Robert Pattinson, he feels more mature in this film and he can pull it off.I usually like Kenneth Branagh, and his acting was good, he has charisma, but the accent...

Maybe I should have watched it in reverse (would have made as much sense). Time to give up this technique Chris!
Also technically while visually spectacular the sound quality was awful and it was very difficult to hear conversations which added to the confusion (mainly due to masks and the score which was inappropriate at times). Do they not test these films with real audiences prior to release? What about subtitles (and an explanation of the film) Chris? Maybe they want you to see the film several times to figure out what's going on. Can't take the risk in case I walk out confused a second time.

The concept of time inversion: This was the most fun part for and makes you think a lot how things that happened cannot be changed anymore. That's why I personally like the movie and watched it multiple times to discover new things.Details: In many scenes you can see multiple versions of the characters and everything seems to make sense.CinematographyThe ScoreVisual EffectsActing: I liked the acting, especially from Kenneth Branagh.The bad:
The pacing is too fast. This happens in some of Nolan's movies when he wants to put too many things in one single movie. The action sequences look nice but do not always have a purpose to explain things. This would work better as a series or a longer movie which takes more time to explain things. Hence, it needs multiple views and explanations of the timelines etc.The sound mixing and loud music.Reversed movements. In some scenes you can see that the actors moved backwards for reversal.Stereotypical characters although acted well.The focus on the abusive relationship. I liked the general idea and fight between the russian mercenaries and Tenet more than the story about the woman.Compared to other movies like Inception I liked this one more since Inception had too many unnecessary uninteresting characters and the concept of dreams was too simple and in this one not everything seems to be that forced like in Inception or Interstellar.

It's tough to rewatch both money wise and time wise. There is basic physics knowledge at play with an ""everything already happened"" time loop. Understanding the movie at the first attempt depends on how good your memory is. If you remember most of the stuff from the beginning, the pieces will start to fall into pieces as the movie goes on and eventually you will realize how absolutely brilliant it is.

In terms of craftsmanship, you have delivered another masterpiece. The subject of inversion is new to this extent, even if TIME is almost always the focus of their attention. You have built in many attempts at explanation, unfortunately with little success. I think of the two bullets on the table. Illogical. The cuts were often much too hard: just half-frozen to death CUT already awake at the other end of the world. That would have been the chance to develop the characters. What do I know about the protagonist? His past, his quirks, his passions, his weaknesses ... nothing. Instead, we're chasing after a McGiuffin called an algorithm. Meh. So all that remains is the suspension of disbelief. An Englishman as a Russian oligarch, great. An ex-vampire plays right, well, the only one who apparently knows what the movie is about. Ms. Debecki was convincing, but she had exactly the same role in THE NIGHT MANAGER. Ludwig Göransson's music is great, rarely have scenes been so well supported and amplified.

And I say no reason cause while watching the movie you progressively find no reason to find out what happens in the end. You do not get attached with the characters and what they are trying to do like in Interstellar or Inception.Direction is great, main actors are pretty good(Washington and Patinson) but everyone else is kind of forgettable.If you undress the over-complicated script and montage you will be left out with a Bond movie. A bad Russian guy who wants to destroy the world just because his ego is bigger than Jupiter and because he is dying.This alone makes Tenet a mediocre movie, and one of Nolan's weakest.

The casting is incredible and John David Washington should be praised to the highest degree from this performance. The revenue and reaction to the movie is overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic which stunted its exposure. It's a movie that should be seen in a theatre as the soundtracks almost trumps every other Nolan film. It keeps you focused and on the edge of your seat the entire time.

I did find it a little slow for the first half hour while it warmed up and obviously any film that involves any type of time travel can be a rough watch for some.

Numerous time travel movies and everyone does the same. Even endgame. But I was genuinely happy of Nolan's approach of backward time travel instead of jumping through time. Top it with very original action sequences, it could have been a classic if not for the writing.What I hate: The plot can be complicated, the concepts of sci-fi elements could be complicated. I am happy to watch a movie with ignorance. But I really HATE the way Nolan writes the dialogues. Viewers have to read between the lines to understand what they are saying. On top of already complicated plot and multiple threads that open during the movie, making the semantics of language complicated serves no purpose and makes the viewer feel DUMB.

The acting is excellent. The main actors make their characters believable and you want to like / hate them depending on whether they are a good guy or a bad guy.The plot was new ( at least to me ) and generally quite interesting, but it was let down.The bad
For a complex plot which relies on the dialogue, why is it so quiet and the music set so loud ? I have a decent-ish sonos system, but there are many parts I have to crank the sound to hear the dialogue, but the music is blaring out.The edit sucks. So much. Did they let the trainee have a go while everyone else went down the pub ? Too many scenes just cut as though there were chunks of the story which needed to be cut out, and it was done badly.Weird plot elements
I don't understand where the scene with Clémence Poésy and the green gloves. Where does this tie into the rest of the plot ? Maybe I missed something in the dialogue because the music was too loud.Why did the protagonist ""hide"" in a wind turbine ? Tactically it couldn't have been a worse location.

The movie refuses to care about both areas, focusing on a plot so forced that every ""surprise"" feels like a cheap, arbitrary event, ending included.
Additionally, the poor handling of the time travel defeats its very purpose: it deprives every action of its meaning and almost instantly kills any interest in following the movie.
Finally:
dialogues are really poormost action scenes are just confusingly directed, particularly the last scenesall combined, the movie is extremely boringdefenders of the movie focus on saying ""let it sink for a bit to understand it"" which is false: there is nothing to understand, it's just a poor plot masked to seem smart.Do yourself a favour and avoid it.",Tenet

3637,j_sharvit,WOW AMAZING,4,20 December 2020,At first I thought the movie was terrible but then halfway through I paused it and pursued a 10-year PhD in theoretical physics. Now it totally makes sense. Everyone who gave this a bad review is just an idiot. Highly recommend doing what I did.,Tenet
3638,beaudbreard,First watch thoughts. Needs subtitles,9,27 December 2020,"I thought this was a great movie. I do not understand why people are saying this is a boring movie. I thought it had an interesting plot of a mysterious organization and civilization from the further fighting over the direction in which entropy/time flow. ""Tenet"" the organization for which the film gets it's name is slowly trying to move the key to this away from the future civillization by moving it further into the past. The reviews talking of a stereotypical russian villian trying to destroy the world simply are not looking at the broader picture the film sets up. The effects in the movie are great however I will agree with many of the other reviews that this film requires you to hear everything and the audio mixing makes the dialogue hard to hear.The what I assume was supposed to be a big twist of them running into themselves at the first turnstile and Neil constantly saving the protagonist was unfortunately very obvious and took away from the wow moment you were supposed to get at the end of the movie. I got all this from watching it my first time, so maybe some of these details are not 100% but definitely close enough for a good understanding. The many reviews saying it requires many viewings to understand what is happening simply were not paying attention while watching. That being said I will definitely watch again at some point to glean out any more information I can to this very dense movie.",Tenet

Mirriam-WebsterTenet is no ordinary movie. It's one of those movies some will love and some do hate. Creation of a deeply abstract mind. it's not easy to relate with, it's actually hard. But does it worth the effort? As I was watching the movie, I hoped from bottom of my heart, that it would surprise me and bring me one of those memorable moments of joy and soak me in pleasure Did it? I decided to write this review to share my experience.
As this is a rather long review, I set an index so you may skip a part as you wish.Index:
A) Goofs
B) A brief analysis
C) Step by step review of the key part of the movie
D) And few words from heartA) Goofs:
In this part I brought goofs in the movie's form(what we see) and contents(what we understand). The time is also mentioned which can be a little more or less due to different versions of the movie.00:03 - The protagonist smashes the glass and jump out of with the contact. To a saloon filled with anesthesia gas. The protagonist wearing a mask but not the contact.00:04 - P(The Protagonist) goes out of saloon to take the package. Returns to saloon. Goes to basement. Why didn't he directly goes to basement?00:06 - Non of does trains has a driver/operator to see whats happening out there?
By the way, the trains Mise-en-scène is a disaster. Each time camera goes from P to the other guy, trains change. White, red, scaffold, lumber, tanker. Also the directions are not intact.00:08 - After opening his eyes, P looks down and sees the sea. But the sea is behind him.00:13 - In the lab, while reverse bullets are being introduced. The gun should be exactly pointed to a hole with exact angle. Otherwise the bullet would not go straight and have to bend while traveling from target back to gun.
By the way, where does the jacket comes from? Bullet comes from that stone, but how does the jacket comes to the chamber? Same to the gunpowder.00:34 - The SUV enters the ramp with a signal light over the head of driver. When it exists, the light is gone.00:43 - When P and Neil are picking the door, they look at the white door, dangling. If the door is broken, there can't be a vacuum. So they can breathe normally.00:56 - In the boat scene, first they are all on the left side of the boat(port side). Long shot, they're in right side(starboard side)
Close, left again.
Then Cath orders to change side. Everyone stands. Next, the are going to left side!
(Brilliant, isn't it)01:05 - What is that helicopter doing in a closed room?01:07 - A 1kg gold bar worths about 60,000$. Each gram of plutonium worths 4,000$. As P says in while cruising, 750g of plutonium was missed, witch worths about 4,000,000$. Isn't 60,000$ a low advanced payment?01:12 - When Andrei spit on Cath, why she reacts as she has been shot or kicked?01:13 - Escort cars have light-bars on top. Next scene, no light-bars.01:13 - As they want to surround the plutonium truck:
High angle camera shows a 2 lane street, becoming 3 lane.
From BMW view, it is 2 lane.
High angle, there is again becoming 3 lane for last truck.
From the truck, it's 3 lane again.Another important thing is, cars won't work in reversed time. It's not like driving in reverse. The engine won't work. It would try to suck in air from the tailpipe to cylinders. Also will try to pump petroleum from cylinders back to the tank. Let aside that it won't even start. In reversed time, electricity would go backward and non of the electronics would function. What have you got us into, Christopher?!!!01:19 - P rolls down the window. Cut, its up again. Next, down again.01:20 - Andrei and the driver move from SUV to Mercedes. Leaving Cath alone. If you reverse the scene, it is: SUV it coming without a driver until driver climbs in.
The driver is reversed too. He wears a mask.01:22 - Cath needs to use a mask, without getting reversed. In the SUV she doesn't wears a mask. But coming to the room, she wears one.
Up unit now, the movie is a perfect disaster. Even though I didn't mention goofs not worthy of talking or those could have been used for dramatization.Shortly I will go step by step through 01:22 - 01:34.
Finally in the third hour of the movie however, I couldn't find any goofs whatsoever.B) A Brief Analysis:
Tenet has three parts
1. Beginning until after 241 is stolen in highway.
2. Peak of the movie is in that twin rooms till explosion of the car. Which also the key to the movie. Which we'll go through!
3. The final battle puts everything had been told previously, to action. It's like in the first two hours the movie had been feeding us with new elements and ideas, now in next half an hour it provides something strange, unbelievable and obscure and we understand it. It's outstanding.In Tenet, Nolan does the same thing to TIME that he did to SPACE in Inception. FOLDING. Do you remember folding the street? A street was folded as the traffic continues. But the cars which where going, are now coming. That folding point is the merry-go-round in Tenet. The time which goes by, now comes by! Rotate the street by 90 degrees counterclockwise. You get the twin rooms and the MGA.I suggest a short break, before you continue. It's getting worse.As the movie is in max complex mode, the characters are as simple as possible.
Good guys are good. Bad guys are bad.
Good guys: ethical. don't kill. won't cheat. Keep their promises. They apologize if they do wrong. They appreciate if someone does something for them. They ask, if they don't know something. They make right decisions.
Bad guys: kill. Cheat. Cruel. Don't think of anything but themselves. If they're not going to have something, they destroy it. Whether a woman, whether the whole universe.The music was almost too much for me. I was this close to mute it or even loose my trust in Tenet and Nolan. It was extremely offensive(like in offense/defense. Not that it offended me). It invaded the mind to crush it to the ground. I don't like this kind of music in movies. It gives me the feeling that director is unable to say whatever she/he/D is trying to say and wants to force it on me by other means. This happened to ""The Dark"" series and I stopped watching after 2-3 episodes.
The music was almost only rhythm and no melody. It's only purpose was to numb the mind and kill the processing of the brain. With no feeling. Didn't like it a bit.Motives:
Nolan used most basic and real motivations for its characters. Spouse, children. In general, survival. Survival of the person, survival of descendants and survival of race(human been). Which he calls ""Prosperity"".
The movie is free from those unnatural and man-made motivations like nationalism, racism, ethics, etc. A single human been, a single universe. I liked it a lot.C) A step by step review of the key part of movie:Tenet should be re-edited in mind! What we see in the movie, is final concussion of all that happened. Combination of many ""normal times"" and many ""reversed times"". As if the ""Time Reverse"" was possible, someone from outside would observe. I can say it's same as analogue color printing. First a blank sheet goes to printer and receive just red colors. Again it enters to the printer and receives blue colors. And again it goes to the printer and receives the yellow color. The result? A color print with hundreds of colors. As it is in Tenet. First events happen in normal time. Then reversed time events get added. And maybe more normal time or reversed time events gets added. Different colors of printing. Layer by layer. So is Tenet.As peak of the movie, in my opinion, is after stealing of 241 till waking in the ship, I write my own edit of the movie:
After P gets back from the fire truck, he gets to the traffic jam without any problem. (cut out Andrei's car and the other reversed car).
Andrei's gang arrive there and shootings start.
They get P but they can't find 241.
They take P to that twin room in normal time. (there is no one in reversed time room. It's empty)
They wait for Andrei to arrive and enter to normal time room(reversed time room is still empty)
Andrei couldn't find 241 in the BMW and asks P where did he put it.
P answers: I already told you.
Andrei doesn't know the answer yet and looks to himself in reversed time room.
Neil's backup team arrives.
Andrei flee to reversed time.(as time reverses, Neil's team are not there yet)
Andrei threatens P via Cath. Cath is not shot yet. Andrei shoots her with reversed bullet. Cath is in normal time(she didn't enter the mga)
Andrei and some of his men go out in reversed time. Cath is in normal time(remember in the SUV, she talks to P normally)
(now we should go back to highway scene when Andrei's car is coming towards P. But in reversed time
Andrei's Mercedes is coming wrong way in the highway. SUV too(with the goof I mentioned before)
Now P decides to come out in reversed time
Andrei with two other goes to traffic jam shooting with Mercedes sedan, looking for 241. Which he can't find.
P finds the orange box and puts he's headset in it so he can hear Andrei's voice.
It's now that Andrei speaks in the radio(the voice Neil says: its not Estonian, it's reversed.)
P in reversed time reaches to P in normal time in highway. Where Andrei is there too. Normal time P throw 241 to reversed time P's car and the empty box to Andrei.
P's car gets crashed.
Andrei in reversed time, continues chasing P in realtime and threatens him via Cath(first things we see after stealing of 241 from the truck but in reverse mode)
Andrei comes back to P's crashed car, takes 241. Boom...
(...aaand scene)
I think I broke my tongue, brain too... These are hard to say even in mother tongue, let alone in another language.Continue in next post...",Tenet
3640,spouria,Tenet? Part 2,9,8 December 2020,"Continue from previous post...
This part is the key to understand the movie. If one gets it right, getting the final scene is a pure pleasure, like non I enjoyed before.D) And few words from heart:
For Westworld series I wrote: Thanks God for the Nolans. (taken from Alan Jackson's Thanks God for the Radio)
It feels good that every once in a while between thousands of movies and series made not for me, one is made for guys/gals like me). To satisfy and fulfill our minds like non. To bring our minds to challenge. How many there? Matrix, Lucy, other Nolans. In stage plays, there was just one: Powdered Milk by Navid Memarzadeh which I assume you hadn't heard of. You might find it on YouTube. These movie/series/plays make me feel less like a stranger and alone. It's brilliant to feel someone else sees the world and its challenges the way I do. And he is actually doing something with it. Bravo.
Tenet is one of those mind opening movies. Introduces things which we don't face in ordinary life. Puts new ideas in mind. The result? We should wait more than a decade to see the results in ""Prosperities""
It's not about physics theories, it's about opening some peoples mind to things that science has accepted as Possible Realities or as we say: TENET
I remember when Martix first came, some 20 years ago, many didn't accept it. Some watched it as an action-thriller movie. But to many of us young people, it was a mind opening and energizing. Tenet and other Nolan movies will do the same to prosperities. Young ones watching these movies will have more open minds and more conscious. Kids yet to come which Max(Cath and Andrei's child) represents them in Tenet.
Kids who will be our prosperities. So they may help us as they would answer our call for help without us even being sure if the threat is real or not. Like the final scene.",Tenet
3641,becerrag-611-170446,"Great sci-fi concept, disappointing plot/characters",8,25 August 2020,"Writing this after a first viewing.I thought the time inversion concept and it's cinematic execution were mind boggling. It wrinkles your brain, in a way no other films do and that alone is quite impressive. John David Washington plays the protagonist brilliantly, it's rare to see an action hero with heart and charisma. He's the real human anchor of this film and really the only character the audience can relate to. Of course the cinematography and set pieces are impressive, though in this film they sometimes felt a bit forced. Like what was the point of that sailing scene other than to film something cool in the open ocean that was kind of reminiscent of Dunkirk?As for what's really disappointing thing about this film.... Nolan's movies usually deal with lofty, complicated concepts but he tries to ground them through human relationships. The theme of time is always connected to human themes like identity, loss, sacrifice and finding a purpose. Because of this, morality is muddled. In Nolan's previous films, there is no clear 'bad guy', he purposefully turns the concept on its head in Memento, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight, and in his other films the characters fight against circumstance not against an archetypal baddie.In Tenet, however, Branagh plays your typical Russian arms dealer wanting to destroy the world. He's ambitious, possessive and controlling and it's such a shame the film makes use of the most tired clichéd character type in the genre. His wife, played by Debicki, is cut from the same archetypal cloth. She's a victimised damsel whose only motivation is her son. So without all the time inversion stuff, in a nutshell, John David Washington is trying to save the world and save the girl from this horrible arms dealer. This is has been the plot of pretty much every Bond movie ever... yawn.This would be a far better film if it had focused on the relationship between the agents and how it's affected by time... we get a tiny taste of this at the end but it's not really explored that much. I would've loved to see more of Pattinson and Washington, since that pair clearly had more chemistry than Washington and Debicki. Priya was also a character they could've done more interesting things with, but instead she's Mme. Exposition. In short, there are a number of different ways Nolan could've given the film a bit more heart, more substance, but it seems he was much too occupied with executing the time inversion concept right, to really develop the characters and the story tying them together.",Tenet
3642,anis-daniel,Bad lead casting,6,10 October 2020,I have to admit I had a problem with John David Washington. He wasn't good. He just didn't keep up with the A-list co-stars and it bothered me. In every scene he was I didn't feel anything. He looked in every scene like he was just trying to remember his lines. Wasn't a good casting choice.,Tenet
3643,babak-zakeri,Awful,1,27 December 2020,"Awful really. Wasn't expecting a Nolan's movie to only be aimed for box officeRepeating context, ideas, scenes, actors from previous movies. No compelling new idea. Lots of talking and pointless action scenes around this confusing idea of moving reverse in timeThe trailer alone should give you an idea of the movie. Lots of chatting and nice background scenes. Movie itself though lacks content to be even shown in trailer. And I personally couldn't emotionally invest in itThe acting is bad cause script is probably bad which is probably the reason you don't see well known actors in the movie either",Tenet
3644,philmccarthy10,Mind bending genius,10,30 August 2020,"Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece, After such a long wait tonget back to the cinema, Tenet reminded me why I missed it so much! Huge set pieces with more ingenuity that most other entire movies can muster. I won't go into any plot details as it's something everyone should see for themselves but the cast is fantastic with zero weak links, John David Washington is a legit superstar in waiting! The final third of the movie will leave you breathless... see it on the biggest screen possible!!",Tenet
3645,smjoshkim,"Trust Nolan, this movie is an absolute masterpiece.",10,5 September 2020,"Give a $1B budget to any other directors on this planet, they couldn't get past the screenplay of Tenet. To he able to pull off this kind of storytelling in a two and half hour movie itself is a miracle.The last time I remember telling myself walking out the theatre ""that was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life"" was James Cameron's Avatar. Tenet takes it to a whole new level of storytelling that is reminiscent of Memento (not as much as Inception).Is it confusing? Yes. Is it difficult to follow? Yes. Does it have any contradictions? HELL NO. I am still thinking about it and marvel at this man's way of thinking.If you have any respect for the creative craft of storytelling narrative, this movie is not possible with our linear way of thinking. Christopher Nolan is the star of the movie and I absolutely respect his vision and the leadership to pull this off.",Tenet
3646,shesaidstella,Maguffins,8,16 September 2020,"I do not really know what this movie is about. This usually happens with Christopher Nolan movies with me. There's lots of stuff and it's interesting to watch and there are clear good guys and bad guys.But what really makes a Nolan movie good to me is the character development. I care about the heroes. I worry about them. I don't want them to be hurt or killed. The hero of this movie is simply called The Protagonist, as though that's really all we need to know about him. He's the good guy. He'll take us through this. We'll be ok if we just stay with him.So who knows what Tenet is about. I don't think it matters. What matters is I cared about what happened, even though I didn't understand it. Metaphor for life maybe?",Tenet
3647,fvbadgfjlhsafkhasdfbyhfl,"Sh!tting in reverse, divorced from reality",3,28 August 2020,"This is Nolan's biggest achievement. His loudest, most ambitious and divorced from reality. A nice visual spectacle, with pleasant but overblown soundtrack by Ludwid Göransson, Tenet makes the mistake of many contemporary titles in the time travel genre - it gets to the details of it. And the further a movie delves into the logistics of a scientifically impossible or unproven phenomenons, the duller it gets.
So, what Tenet ends up being is one predictable, poorly planned and lacking in inspirational fantasy excuse for loud fights and explosions. There is a point of detail beyond which a movie is no longer entertaining, just like how a map that has too many signs becomes useless. And so, the only interesting conclusion I can draw from this production is that if you travel back in time, you first see the products of your bowel movement and you then have to stop and suck it back in for your organism to function properly.
In light of this conclusion, screenwriters need to be careful about the implications of their work. If you allow your ideas to spread in this kind of directions, you've done a bad job at suspending disbelief and entertaining. So, for a movie all about cause and effect, and thinking more carefully, Tenet really asks the viewer to think less and enjoy the pretty pictures on the screen. How's that for a paradox, I'd ask Nolan.",Tenet
3648,csands-675-121991,"If you need everything spelled out, this film is not for you.",10,2 January 2021,"Nolan and his team have accomplished the near-impossible. They made movie that, even when you've already seen it once and knowing the ending, it does not spoil the movie on the second or third watch.This film is a masterpiece. I finished watching it and the next morning immediately put it on again. The conclusion was so satisfying I had to go back down the rabbit hole to see how far it actually goes.Unfortunately... a lot of moviegoers are used to simple, easy-to-digest films. There's nothing wrong with a nice and easy-to-follow linear story. The type where you can turn your brain off and just ride it out, munching popcorn and ending up where you knew you would end up all along.If you are hoping you can turn off your brain while the plot is spoon-fed to you, do yourself a favor and skip this movie.Otherwise, buckle up.The rabbit hole is DEEP on this one.",Tenet

3650,cselby-729-940005,"After months of waiting, a huge disappointment.",5,21 September 2020,"It just wasn't entertaining. Some of the dialogue was hard to hear an understand. Performances were good. Honestly, it had the feel of a Bond pic with time travel at the center: The Protagonist's gray suit; Bond name of one of the characters. If Christopher Nolan wants to make a Bond film I'm sure they could make a deal. Wait for home video on this one so you can rewind it to understand some of the bits. Bond in November should be way better...and entertaining.",Tenet

The premise, the plot, the cringey dialogue all too laughable. If there was an attempt to beat Inception, this truly failed. Even the actions scenes felt contrived. Wish I could go back and take my time-wasted on this garbage.",Tenet
3652,hadeelsaidawi,I walked out of the cinema early,1,7 October 2020,"An extremely disappointing film by Nolan. We were so excited to break the lockdown period by watching this film, but we couldn't stand the ridiculousness for more than an hour and a half. Acting was just awful and devoid of any artistic skills. Script was poor, artificial, lacked originality and substance. Actors kept reciting cheesy platitudes about how this is worst than a nuclear holocaust. The concept could have had a potential, but the execution was so remarkably bad to the extent I even lamented the wasted budget that went on destroying a plane for vain.",Tenet

Kenneth Brannah overacting with ludicrous accent and the female character was memorable only because she literally stood out (towered over every male character)This is the kind of film that makes industry insiders nod heads & agree its phenomenal filmmaking while us plebs are like ""wtaf are you doing Nolan?""Mumbled lines under heavy background sound,with a lead actor who needs a ladder to make eye contact with leading lady...Such a disappointment..On the plus side,could possibly help insomnia.",Tenet
3654,rajatjangra477,Backward Action Through Time,8,15 January 2021,"I have been already a fan of Mr. Christopher Nolan, and I like being stimulated with intelligent movies.

Intriguing, unexpected, Mind boggling, hair-raising highstake thriller and of course full of backward action through time.Loved the score as well, Great harmony use and instrument variations. You don't see movies like this one every year. In some ways, 2020 was special.",Tenet

3656,jurassictrek,Nolan's worst since Dark Knight Rises.,5,25 July 2021,"People say it's is a movie that you need to see twice. Too bad the ONLY reason you would even want to see it twice is to convince yourself that you must've 'missed' something. This is just bad story telling. It's not confusing because it's nonlinear, nor is it confusing because it's unconventional although both of those statements are true. Rather, it's confusing because it's a story poorly told. Would making a movie that you NEED to see three times be even more challenging? Artistic? Intelligent? What about 5 or 12 or 100 times? At a certain point we may just have to admit that liking something upon first viewing doesn't diminish its artistic merit. Neither are people who don't like it upon first viewing lesser film fans. Maybe there's just too much going on in the world to pay money for something they can't physically HEAR.

I can almost see the fear in their eyes that Nolan is going to yell at them for showing any emotion besides trepidation. The main actor, John David Washington, has zero charisma in this movie. He's portrays a diluted version of a character. Nolan presumably had a say in who was cast for this movie. Once you hire an actor, let them act! Don't try to change them, like a controlling spouse in a toxic relationship.The time-shifting aspect is the selling point, and it's more compelling in the trailer than in the actual movie. During the movie, bland dialog overwhelmed the main sci-fi concept. I wanted things to get better and make more sense, but they never did.

It's also, in my humble opinion, the worst Nolan movie by a country mile. Cinematography is atrocious (for Nolan standards), it's incredibly fast paced, disjointed and the editing is scandalous. It's the first Nolan movie which truly feels just like a blockbuster. Above average one, but still. Two leads, Washington and Pattison were great, but the characterization is weak, almost non-existent because it's all action. Brannagh's villain was ok-ish, Debicki's character seemed like she was added in the third week of filming, and I didn't care for any of the characters. Emotional connection? None. Dialogue was so corny at times. At one point Pattison's character is explaining the rules of backwards-time-travel-thingy, and it felt like he was literally explaining it to the audience. Bottom of the barrel.Nolan is no Tarkowski, but he's been making some of the most interesting mainstream movies of the last 15 years, and it's sad seeing him fall this hard. Felt like he made half of the movie, and then some random guy shot the rest and then it was all edited together poorly. It's worth seeing for several incredible but very brief shots, great action scenes, sets and sound, as well as ridiculous plot which will be memed to death.

Music and sound track with massively pounding bass. Entertaining for what it is but.... time inversion is BS. Does not work in the movie. By the time you get to the end of the movie you give up completely on trying to understand it because it does not make sense. Entropy has nothing to do with time travel. It is a law of thermodynamics that basically says things go from order to disorder. Actors are flat. No character development. Main protagonist has only one objective to save the world. No background or real love interest. Dialog is flat. You can watch it many times but it still won't make sense. Unlike Inception where there is some shred of probable science this is sadly lacking any credibility. If you try to understand it your brain will hurt. If you are looking for deep dialogue with plausible character development this movie is not for you.

I watched it in the movie theatre a week after its release and saw it again today. I didn't like it as much in the theatre because it was a little too fast to digest. Now that I watched it by pausing and thinking over it, I appreciated it a lot more.The filming of the action sequences - one actor going forward in time and the other going backward, is pure genius choreography. The background score is engaging and exciting when it needs to be. The Freeport vault sequence in Oslo was awesome, but it got better when we see it again from the future protagonist's perspective.

Times where you don't really understand what the characters' motives are: why are they planning a heist? who is the enemy they are shooting at?

3680,patricky728,"""Tenet"" Review - ""Don't try to understand it. Just feel it.""",7,8 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan is no slouch when it comes to making ambitious, technically sophisticated films. Films like ""Inception"" and ""Dunkirk"" demonstrate his ability to take fairly straightforward premises and tell a captivating story while executing strongly on a cohesive vision. It's such a shame then that ""Tenet"" is his most fascinating film to date, but is his most poorly executed as well.""Tenet"" stars John David Washington as ""the Protagonist"" (yes, that is all he is referred to as), a CIA agent who is swept up into a fight against a group of people who can invert time. Throughout the film's first act the plot is hard to follow as the Protagonist jumps around locations with Neil (Robert Pattinson) and Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) with often very little context of why they are there or what they are after. Well, let me rephrase: I think a lot of these components are in the film but are lost in the film's audio design and the directing of the actors. Characters speak rapidly and constantly about what is happening and why they must do something, never really giving the audience enough time to process what is being said. There is one scene in particular with Michael Caine (who we never see in the film again) that sticks out so blatantly from the rest of the film where after it finished, my girlfriend leaned over to me and admitted she had no idea what just happened in that scene. As the film goes on this becomes less of an issue but in the first act where most of the world building and plot setup occurs, it definitely stops the viewer from engaging as much as they probably should; I think watching with subtitles will dramatically improve the experience.It doesn't help the matter either that the Protagonist is a pretty boring one at that, with the supporting characters are not very interesting themselves. I realized as the film was progressing that I was invested in the film not for the story really but for the next instance of the film's inversion gimmick. By the third act the film devolves into a ""stop the bad guy before activating his doomsday device"" trope and despite having the slick ""inversion"" paint slathered over it, there is not much left to the plot and characters by that point. The acting itself in the film is very strong and subtle, especially those of Pattinson, Debicki and Kenneth Branagh as the antagonist Andrei Sator; Pattinson is suave and precise with his line delivery (even if it's pretty zany at times) and Debicki really shows her range, going from provocative to distressed many times in the film. Branagh is particularly of interest because many times he quickly goes from stoic and intimidating to brutal and dominating. Alas, if not for the film's implementation of the inversion, I reckon this film would be fairly mundane because the characters themselves don't contribute much to the plot or enjoyment of the film.Much akin to the polarizing reaction to ""Inception,"" where moviegoers raved about how the film played with their mind, ""Tenet"" operates in a similar vein of mind-bending storytelling. The ""inversion"" mechanic of the film creates for so many great moments-from plot reveals to set pieces-that by the film's end, I wasn't left with questions about the mechanics; in other words, the film satisfactorily explores its own mechanics, not leaving much room to nitpick certain scenarios or how something might not have worked. There was a long period of time while watching where the plot felt so disconnected from the action, but about halfway through the film comes a point where it all clicks and things start making sense. A scientist character says to the Protagonist early on into the film when he asks how the inversion works, ""Don't try to understand it. Just feel it,"" and that is largely my greatest recommendation going into the film.""Tenet"" comes at a really unique time, as it was the first film I saw in the theater since the COVID-19 pandemic began. It was so exhilarating being back in the theater (experiencing a Nolan film no less) after being away for so long. I really wanted this film to be amazing--a new Nolan film that not only satisfies my expectations of him but of a film in general after this drought. To that end, the acting, cinematography, visual effects and score of ""Tenet"" are all executed well making it suitable for the theater, but its dialogue problems and uninteresting characters prevent it from being a film I can instantly recommend.",Tenet

""Why ?"" ""Because it will make this other thing happen"" (cue the things happening -in CGI). I won't spoil the surprise but it's in the scene where Michael Caine gives his take-the-money-and-run cameo. Although there is nothing but plot, you should find it easy to identify the stock characters and allocate appropriate personalities. Beautiful, skinny seven foot tall woman who has accidentally married the world's most evil arms dealer ; World's most evil arms dealer (Branagh as Sergei Meerket) ; Dependable mockney soldier who has mysteriously risen to senior officer, despite an accent that drifts from Bow Bells to Beau Bridges.

3683,dominik-trefzger-40-213203,Surprisingly simple action thriller. Confusing narrative strands. Nolan's play with the time-space continuum does not make it any better.,6,3 September 2020,"""Tenet"" is a simple action thriller, that is not much fun due to its confusing narrative strands, and that does not achieve a greater sense of meaning by playing with the time-space continuum.On the morning of 26 October 2002, Russian special forces stormed Moscow's Dubrovka Theatre. Terrorists had taken 850 theatre-goers hostage two and a half days earlier. The special units had previously introduced a gas into the theatre, in order to eliminate the attackers. However, the gas probably also caused 125 hostages to die as a result of poisoning. This historical excursus also describes the first minutes of Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" in an opera house in Kiev. This does not yet have much to do with the main plot. The attentive viewer, however, already realises in these scenes that the conventional time-space structure does not apply in this film.Great hopes lie in ""Tenet"". It is the first big blockbuster to be released in cinemas since a longer time period. It is uncertain whether the 225 million dollars which the mega-project is said to have cost, can be regained despite the worldwide corona restrictions.Nevertheless, viewers should not hope to be brought back to the pre-corona era. ""Tenet"" fits surprisingly well into the present day: there is talk of ""lockdowns"". The characters sometimes wear gas masks, without which their lungs could not survive. There is a state of emergency.When Christopher Nolan releases a new film, about whose plot virtually nothing is known in advance, no more is generally expected than the big hit, which he has certainly achieved with films like ""Inception"" or""Memento"". But now at the latest it is clear: the magic has disappeared. ""Tenet"" does not come close to the previous works just described. Even if there are astonishing similarities to ""Inception"" and especially to ""Interstellar"", Christopher Nolan delivers nothing more than a simple action thriller.""Tenet"" could also have been made by Michael Bay. But sadly ""Tenet"" is so much less fun than, say, the last Bay film ""6 Underground"". In terms of content, however, both films are about saving the world from a powerful oligarch. And in doing so, ""Tenet"" waves ancient recipes: The evil, megalomaniacal and crazy oligarch is Russian. The heroes of the film embody the West. There is a cold war. They do not arm themselves with atomic bombs, but with other devices that could destroy life on earth in an instant. This narrative strand is paired with a pitiful woman who is trapped in the hands of her husband and fears for her child. She uses all means to get out of her predicament. She even accepts that the whole of humanity could be destroyed. Somehow strange!But the plot of ""Tenet"" cannot be described quite so simply. Nolan explains how the physical principles known to the average person are thrown off course. The physical entropy of objects is reversible in the future, so that they invert temporally. To explain it very simply: processes are reversed. This not only makes it possible to ""shoot bullets back"" into a gun. Rather, time can be reversed so that for inverted people, time runs backwards and the world also moves backwards. Nolan wants to make possible, what many people probably want at the moment: To go back to the good old days and to put the world in order where it got unhinged. Then maybe we wouldn't have to sit in the cinema wearing masks today.Anyone who tries to understand this new world order as a viewer is unlucky. I can already see how fans in internet forums are breaking the film down into its individual components and showing with dedication how logical and comprehensible all this is supposed to be. This time, however, the calculation will not work out. Too many contradictions come to light during the film. The film exposes itself when an entropy expert says to the so called protagonist, played by John David Washington: ""Don't try to understand it. Just feel it.""Already in ""Inception"" not everyone was enthusiastic about Nolan's ""Explanatory Cinema"", where the viewer is asked to make an effort to bring together the confusing narrative strands. Unlike ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"", however, ""Tenet"" is far less astonishing. Everyone has probably seen a film running backwards at some point. The special effects in ""Tenet"" seem almost funny: People walking backwards, cars driving backwards and explosions running backwards. Sometimes you feel reminded of ""Matrix Reloaded"" from the year 2003.Time travel is nothing new either. Fortunately, the question of what happens when a person travelling back in time, kills his own grandfather has finally been answered: He will still exist, even if he would never have been born without his grandfather. This phenomenon will henceforth be called ""Grandfather Syndrome"". Too perplexed to understand, but somehow cool. However, the true exciting questions that could arise during time travel are only touched upon.""Tenet"" does not achieve the originality or depth that ""Inception"" had. Implanting a thought into a person's head through their dream world is a more subtle approach than using time travel to stop them from destroying the world by force and military means. As a result, disillusionment is more likely to set in when the confused strands of the plot cannot be brought together. Sometimes the film plays forwards, sometimes backwards, then forwards again and in the end everything is fine. The action is supported by the noisy film music by Ludwig Göransson, which could also be composed by Hans Zimmer.The characters in ""Tenet"" also pale in comparison to the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio or Marion Cotillard in ""Inception"". John David Washington and Kenneth Branagh fulfil all clichés of a hero and villain. It was by far not that simple in ""Inception"". Nevertheless, it is not quite clear who in ""Tenet"" is working with whom for what reasons and what the overall aim of the whole thing is.
Only Robert Pattinson brings in an interesting character. Unfortunately, the film is so busy pushing the plot forward and explaining that there is no room for interpersonal moments. The film simply does not care about its characters.In the end, the word ""Tenet"" describes the film very well: It is a so-called palindrome, that can be read forwards and backwards. It describes a dogma. But it remains unclear which dogma that is.",Tenet
3684,kraigg-1,"Good, but not Christopher Nolan good",6,16 December 2020,"Let me preface this by saying that I love Christopher Nolan films. He hasn't let me down, until now. Inception and Interstellar are my particular favorites. However the special effects and stunts are here, the story is needlessly complex. I also couldn't empathise with the main character, and this is made worse by the actor John David Washington seeming to lack charisma, credibility, and gravitas needed in main character. Think Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matthew McConaughey - you like the characters they played, you empathised with their characters, and you wanted them to succeed. I didn't feel that connection at all with John David Washington. Robert Pattinson was much better, and showed him to be a more seasoned actor. He had the energy and Natural acting to help drive the story forward. Had they given him the main character's role, it would've warranted adding another 2-3 additional stars to this review",Tenet
3685,LordSTS,This supposed saviour of cinema turned on it.,4,19 December 2020,"First of all, I must say that I am not a Nolan hater. I loved Nolan right up to Dark Knight which was the high point of his career. After that I started to see his hubris and pretentiousness showing through in Dark Knight Rises. Interstellar and Dunkirk were similarly pretentious and over dramatic - but that didn't prevent me from enjoying any of those movies. But I knew his hubris will come to a high point one day that will destroy his movies... and that day is here.Something I have noticed is that people are reluctant to admit they didn't understand the movie thinking that will make them look stupid. This is something that happened with Inception and Interstellar too. This mentality is making it harder and harder to engage with Nolan fans.I knew this was a complex movie to understand even before I went to the theatre, but it quickly dawned on me that Nolan deliberately made sure we wont understand it; he has intentionally made the dialogue very inaudible. (I refuse to believe it was sound mixing mistake because even a rookie YouTuber knows how to sound mix better than this.) So essentially Nolan is making sure that you will have to come back more than once even if you do posses the significantly above average intelligence required to understand this movie in first go. This movie came out in a time movie theatres are in trouble; this was supposed to save the cinema; people were reluctant to go out and risk it by going to cinema. But Nolan fans had faith in him and they decided to risk it. But when they went to the cinema what they found was a seemingly nonsensical story which required you to come again to the theatre and double the risk you took. Instead of rewarding the fans for coming to the theatre in a time like this they were pissed on. Don't take me wrong, this movie is a technical masterpiece and if you are the type of person who don't care about a story you would be satisfied by this, but most of us wants a story that we can understand, an emotional core, and characters that are relatable.And finally, I have to say: This movie is understandable. There is a structure here and the pieces do fit together. But depending on your intelligence you need at least 2 viewings with subtitles. I have slightly below average intelligence and I had to watch this once in theatre and twice on Blu-Ray with subtitles to even begin to understand this. Then I had to watch a YouTube video explaining the timelines with a diagram to fully understand it. That is why I think this movie will age better; when people see this movie multiple times, they will start to understand it. But in my book, if a movie requires you to watch it more than once, that is not a movie I can stand behind.",Tenet

3687,etorsten-1,"Why Christopher Nolan fails substantially with ""Tenet""",6,27 December 2020,"This film shows how a director can completely overreach himself because he believes in his own apparent genius.Christopher Nolan, in my opinion, fails colossally and throws the whole story completely into the sand.I would like to mention a few reasons for this here:
1. The characters remain unapproachable in a certain way and you simply can't develop an emotional connection to them as a viewer. There is simply not enough emotion to identify with the main character(s).
2) The female lead is practically reduced to her love for her son and thus severely limited in character. Basically, this is even misogynistic!
3. The story is not able to explain the effect of time travel really well. On the most part, it remains with hints of content, which is not enough for such a story.
4. Nolan de facto shows time travel and uses revolving doors, through which the protagonists (always only) switch to the past. If these are time machines, then I kind of have to laugh.
5. The resolution of one of the core questions (who is the blond companion of the main character?) comes at the very end. Well, it's just illogical, since the main character, played by John David Washington, never really asks. What a nonsense!And so Nolan gives away an insane amount of potential, which he could have used differently.
The great score by Ludwig Göransson and the sometimes very exciting action scenes help the film at least partially.So everyone should decide for themselves if it's worth investing two and a half hours of their time in this so hyped film.",Tenet

One thing I could say about the movie, Don't try to understand too much about tenets. What was happened and it has happened. Time vs survival concept and looks in a cool way :)
I would recommend watching in IMAX. Movies make more difference with sounds. If someone want to understand clearly this movie. there are two options, one is watching two or more times.

Absolutely no story, no character development, actors are in explaining mode all the time because there is no sense in anything, the bad guy is cliche, the love interest is empathetic as an iceberg and the worst thing about the movie is that you don't care for what is happening.

Doesn't sound so smart anymore when you sum it up like that, does it?You may disagree with my on my 1/10 rating, because after all not every single last aspect of the movie is bad. The cinematography sure is nice and Robert Pattinson does give a decent performance (the main actor not so much). I recently made a rule that I would deduct up to 5 points if important plot details are lost due to bad audio and/or actors mumbling their lines. This movie straight-up deserves the full 5 point penalty. So... sorry for all the people who legitimately did a good job in this movie and are now not getting credit.Even if the dialogue had been more clear, there are still other audio issues. Let me put it this way: I'm a huge fan of Death Metal and Black Metal. I often sit there with headphones on blasting music for several hours. Yet this movie gave me more of a headache than music ever did. Since this review is marked for spoilers it's too late to tell you now, but next time you're gonna watch a Nolan movie you better bring ear plugs. Also, if possible, find a theater that plays movies with subtitles.The editing is also hilariously bad, especially when coupled with the pretentious script. At multiple times two characters walk and talk. The movie will occasionally cut to two-second flashbacks and then cut back to the two talking characters who mysteriously appeared in completely different locations. Is... is this the same conversation? If they talk long enough, will they eventually end up on the moon, still talking about the same thing?Oh well, I suppose you could get a kick out of it when watching it as a parody of Nolan movies.",Tenet
3701,sen_anom,MUMBLING AND MOUTH BREATHING,5,1 September 2020,"Sadly I am going to rewatch this film. In order to hopefully find it interesting. Aside from the muffled dialogue, I found the the actors mouth breathing WAAY too distracting.As for the acting I thought most of the actors seems fluid and natural, actually pretty good. John David Washington seemed to be a fish out of water. His acting was pretty empty it just did not seem believable.With more work maybe I'll invert my rating.",Tenet
3702,wftylerg,Nolan GOATED,10,4 September 2020,Words cannot describe this movie. Christopher Nolan will go down in history. John David Washington showing why he is the next household name in Hollywood. Robert Pattinson shutting up all the haters and showing them he is back better than ever. Once you can rap your head around this movie you clearly know this is yet another masterpiece from Nolan.,Tenet
3703,kdivyesh56,TENET,10,6 December 2020,"Call it a masterpiece or give it a single star, the point is amidst all the puzzled pieces separated across time, I see the vision of Chris to bring it to reality, in a way only a great artist can. The antagonist and the protagonist are relatable to us in matters we can't imagine. We all have Andrei in us. He made a point by mentioning about the disappointment of future generationsfrom us, so much so that they have decided to reverse the time. We must open our eyes now to realize that the true essence of reality is not in one's own benfits, but the benfit of the combined holistic world (including nature). Coming back to movie, people who tell the score is too loud might be somewhat corrct, but I didn't feel it before I read their reviews, since I was so lost. I watched the first 2 hours twice before watching the ending half hour and I am super surprised by the originality of the movie. Christopher brings the nostalgia where he started with films like Memento and ending it with Tenet on higher notes. We see the things in reverse without wondering the extremely complicated shooting styles they used.Overall, it is worth watching if you have patience. It brings you to the reality where you feel you are protected by the future.After understanding this movie, movies on time travel and movies like Inception which generally follow linear forward moving timeline seem like a grandma's cheesecake!",Tenet

Nolan needs a script doctor.,4,27 August 2020,"After a pandemic which shut theatres across the world, I was hugely excited to have an excursion to the cinema to see a cinematic film in IMAX for the first time in ages. Truthfully, the day was brilliant and I don't regret a thing, however, the film made many regrettable choices. As the story unwinds and it reaches a halt, you have a startling realisation that nothing happened. No motive is ever explained. NO character ever even near touching a third dimension. And why do I always feel like Kenneth Branagh does Russian accents? Why do we never hire Russians?Lol. There's not that much more to say, the science is as flimsily explained as the character motives and despite some really epic sequences (bar the final one, wtf is going on?) it's just not a very good film and possibly one of Nolan's worst.It feels like there's nobody nearby to check him and actually doctor his scripts anymore.On the plus side, Lil Denzel might really be a big actor.",Tenet
3706,MysteryOne,The Definition of a 7,6,2 December 2020,"Of all the movies I have seen, Interstellar is my favorite. So, understandably, when I heard Christopher Nolan was producing another movie, I was immediately interested in what I thought would a thought-provoking, original movie from him. Well, it turns out that this movie wasn't any of that. It's a decent movie, it has solid characters and very good acting, but it also has very weird dialogues and the main plot of the movie is in itself very flawed. It's like always having this feeling that something in the story is off, because in fact it really doesn't make much sense. Its a movie that tries to be smart, but in reality, its quite dumb. And thats exactly why I think it deserves a 7: very good idea, bad execution, but still what I think is a good time.",Tenet

However, since I watched the movie a few days ago, I have carefully reconsidered and re-examined the latest Nolan. I have come to the conclusion that it is easily one of the worst movies ever made, confirming my initial intuition. I tried to find some good but couldn't find any.The dialogue: horrible and cringe.
The sound mixing: ... Oh boy
The acting: yikes
Action: pretty ridiculous and unconvincing
Plot: nonsensical yet somehow still predictableDon't do time travel and try to explain it scientifically. Don't pretend you 'get' this movie, there's nothing to get here. I wish this movie was never made and I wish Nolan could be held accountable for making such trash.",Tenet

So good and mind bending, youll have to see it twice.",9,1 September 2020,"I spent the first hour or so of the movie trying to figure out what the hell was going on, and then about midway through the movie theres a string of ""aha"" moments where everything begins to come full shape. Then vintage Nolan kicks in with a hour and a half of the best filmmaking you will ever see.
Acting,cinematography, sound, set design, and mise en scene were all A level, but the writing could have been touched up a little for better understanding.
The time travel thats utilized in this movie is still something im trying to understand however, so i will definitely be going a second time.
Would also recommend seeing in dolby as i had to see this in normal AMC and could tell i was missing out on what was already a incredible soundtrack with average speakers.",Tenet
3710,dmehic,I don't know.....Hard to say if it is either Nolan's best or worst....,7,27 August 2020,"After waiting for so many months and many push-backs due to corona, Christopher Nolan's Tenet finally hits theaters. I am lucky enough to have seen it now in my region.I am not the biggest Nolan fanboy, I used to love his films when I was younger, but after growing up, I realised his films are only big spectacle, even if it is good spectacle (which it is) but far away from THE pinnacle of cinema as many other Nolan fanboys try to claim it to be. But nonetheless, he is still a talented director who puts out the more interesting Hollywood blockbusters to the public, considering the fact that brain-dead superhero movies are currently infesting the film market. And off course I was excited to go and see it.My feelings are currently mixed. I will have to wait off a few days until I give it a definitive rating, but I have to say this. The scope of this film is just beyond anything Nolan has ever touched, it might be the biggest film he's ever done in terms of scope and the story. The film was never boring at a single minute, every minute flew by quickly, it is indeed a fast paced adventure. The cinematography is pure eye candy, surely one of Nolan's best looking films he has done, and that is saying a lot, but the fact that the movie took place in so many different locations surely helped that matter of fact because it takes place in Mumbai, Tallinn, Siberia, London, Oslo, this film went everywhere around the world just like if I was experiencing a James Bond film. In terms of all the technical aspects, this film is a pure masterpiece, from the sound design and mixing, the cinematography, the Color grading and Color palette, it is a technical marvel. And the great music adds to the film so much and gets you excited for every scene, even if Ludwig Göransson ain't no Hans Zimmer. The acting was, as usual, fantastic from everyone involved.At the other hand, this film went overboard with its story. Even if you activate all of your brain for this film, you will still be left confused for this film. This film requires ofc all of your attention, but it will still confuse you no matter what. This is the kind of film that will require 3-4 viewings, not because I believe it's a masterpiece, but just to get to understand some of the concepts this film is trying to bring to the table. There will be many audience members who will leave the theater saying that it's ""all nonsense"" or ""just pretentious"", but I think Nolan just put the gear this time to level 6 instead of his usual level 3-4.At the end of the day, I have conflicting opinions about it, I think that I tend more towards liking the film since I did have my fun with this film to a certain extent, but I need some time to process all of which I have seen. I still don't know if I consider this a very smart film that brought the concept of time to a whole new level or if it's a pretentious disappointment that tries to over-complicate a super-simple story (or to put it more simple: if it is Nolan's best or worst). I will see.*originally posted on my Letterboxd account*",Tenet

3715,HiTacos,Left Disappointed,6,7 September 2020,"Christopher Nolan's Tenet has such an amazing concept, but falls short. Shame because I had such high hope's for this movie.The editing was probably the worst I've ever seen. It kept cutting too quickly during conversations, making it feel too scripted and had no natural feel to it. The timing to jump from one scene to the next was odd and only left me more confused and wondering what happened between those scenes.The audio wasn't great either. Can barely understand what the actors were saying. Background noise was louder than the actors speaking, making it even harder to follow and leaving you confused as to who the bad guy was, what he wanted and what the protagonists were gonna do about it.The writing was pretty cheesy and the acting was below average. Characters were poorly written and you couldn't care less about any of the characters in the film. No emotional connecting between them and the viewer.I love almost all of Nolans films and I'm just disappointed with this one. And it pains me to say this, but it could possibly be his worst one yet.",Tenet

It is an excellent production, directed by Christopher Nolan, who once again shocks with incredible action scenes, incredible shots and the original script, which has nothing to do with his previous films. The photography is also amazing, the two protagonists are quite good, with Pattinson standing out more and the music finally fits perfectly with the film and creates an incredible atmosphere and huge suspense. The negatives of the film are the clichés that exist despite the original script (the good one who wants to save the world and the bad one who wants to destroy it) and its long duration as there were several unnecessary scenes and in this way you got tired of it detuned, making it difficult to understand the already difficult plot and losing some details that may have been the key to understanding what was going on.",Tenet
3718,freeyingying,Disappointing for a Nolan's movie,6,8 September 2020,"The movie is not that hard to understand, especially when you can literally guess the plot. Those plot twists (I suppose?) like the protagonist was fighting himself at the Freeport, the woman jumping off the boat was Kat herself, and it was the protagonist who recruited Neil... I sensed all that when those scene first happened, I watched the movie with my mom and she told me she saw them coming as well, too cliche!And the physics part, inverted entropy, anti-matter, time travel, blah blah blah, it could be a very cool concept for a sci-fi movie but unfortunately remains a wasted potential. I have a BSc in physics and now a PhD student in nuclear engineering, I feel frustrated with how the movie dealt with those concept. Just imagine remove all that from the movie, simply be like, the villain has a weapon of mass destruction, both sides have time travel technology, how is this gonna be any different? Not much, right?Tenet is a typical Hollywood solo-hero-save-the-world (and the girl) action movie with predictable ending which I didn't expect from Nolan. To be honest I would give it a 10/10 if the ending was the world actually ended with Andrei's death and we got to see a whole new world of inverted physics and time.",Tenet

Just admire it as a movie as it is. Don't think of it as a like a movie of it as inception. It's a masterpiece in its own.

3722,thelordmasterrgaming,"A complicated hindrance at first, but after a second watch and an explanation towards the films plot, I ended up loving it.",8,7 September 2020,"At first watch it was a initial disappointment, with such high hopes from Nolan back in the directors chair. This script is overcomplicated to the extreme, like many of Nolan's films - but it's foundational theme or premise (e.g. in Inception, the concept of a dream within a dream, is easy to remember) is too vague and hard to follow. The characters are as I see it quite 2-dimensional overall, but all deliver great performances nevertheless.It misses the top mark because it cannot compare with the mastery of filmmaking that Inception and Interstellar bring to the screen, but it's visuals and it's acting make it very entertaining despite that - I gave it a 6/10.As I went in for the second viewing after understanding the plot, the film was bumped up to a sold 8/10, once you understand what's going on and the chronology, it's a brilliant interpretation of what could be perceived as time travel. I cannot deny that this film is extremely overcomplicated for the casual audience and that can deter people, but if you thoroughly enjoy Nolan's craft, give this one another go after watching and explanation video... (even though I shouldn't really have to watch one in the first place) and you may enjoy it more the second time around.",Tenet

My 13 year old watched it with me on my third viewing and she found the film captivating and worthy of her time (and that is saying alot for the 10 sec video generation)... And by the way she grasp the concept and most of the story in her first viewing with the occasional ""wait what... oh... how could someone think up a movie like this and then make it"". I replied ""that's what I felt like when I saw Star Wars as a kid in the 80s"". Mindblowing. The films concept is bold and refreshing and I for one enjoy films that are crafted with such complexity that serves the story and can completely anesthetize my expectation. This film was like nothing I have ever seen before and I welcome that. I can honeslty say it was vaguely familiar yet completely unpredictable. I knew there would be fight scenes... but not like I thought. I knew there would be a beginning and an end... again not like I thought. I can't help but appreciate a story that makes me feel ""new"" at movie watching. It reminds me of when I was a child and found every film entertaining and cool. For a while I actually thought my taste in films had become more sophisticated, but in truth I haven't grown any more sophisticated at all, films however, have degenerated into simple, predictable, uncreative simulacrum of originality. I am disappointed by the mediocre ratings and reviews I've seen. It makes me think of the audiences in the 2006 film ""Idiocracy"" where in the film if the people couldn't understand something, they said it was ""stupid"" or ""dumb"". They completely destroyed what they didn't understand behind a wall crude jokes and slapstick humor. But for us viewing the film we knew they were the idiots, hence the title. But this film encourages you to experience it more than once. Surprisingly it gets better with repeat viewing. Not because you ""get it now"" but because you see it was intended to be viewed and scrutinized repeatedly. Like Stanley Kubrick or Terry Gilliam films, full of hidden meaning and nuances. The film respects and assumes the audience is intelligent and wants to think for themselves. Tenet is well paced, and hums with tension. The cinematography and the score by Ludwig Göransson are awesome. This film deserves an honest review. Like Nolan's previous films this film tries to reach for heights unseen. In 2005 Batman Begins reached and set forth a superhero benchmark that many films later benefited from but dare not reach any higher. In 2010 Inception gave us a film that proved a high concept scifi film could be ultra cool fun. We've had ten years to prepare for what Nolan has crafted with Tenet and I think it deserves more than a reputation for being ""confusing"".",Tenet

3752,tuomaskarna,Naive action film,1,29 August 2020,"This is an action film packed with fast-paced fight scenes and rapid plot twists. But the film is disappointing in every respect. Most importantly, the plot is uninteresting and the characters are simplistic and shallow. The sci-fi twist of the story is ridiculous.The men are of simple man's-gotta-do-what-man's-gotta-do types. And women are portrayed as usual in Hollywood films: beautiful objects, caring mothers, or vengeful lovers. None of the characters appear as real human with cognitive depth. There's no discussion, no reflection, no personal growth. The plot relies on naive narratives: the hero must save the beautiful girl, the mother will do anything to save her child, the betrayed lover seeks for a revenge, the omnipotent antagonist wishes to destroy the world due to personal vanity. What's new, Nolan?The pseudo-scientific idea of reversing the time is yet-another crazy Hollywood plot twist that does not have any scientific basis. As a scientist the film makes me laugh. It seems that the action genre as a whole has been completely exhausted, so the only way to create something ""new"" (and to keep the viewer from falling asleep) is to make the cars run backwards.Some people think that the film is interesting (""masterpiece"") because the plot is complex and you cannot spot all the details on the first watch. Well, I did spot most of it on the first watch and ... it was not interesting. The story is predictable and does not provide any new ideas that haven't been dealt with in previous films. The underlying philosophy of the future of the world and righteousness is naive and simplistic.",Tenet

3755,kmsebola,A TECHNICALLY MARVELOUS DISASTER,3,8 September 2020,"To say that TENET is confusing would be an understatement. Its the type of confusing that leaves you uninvested in the outcome simply because you have no idea what it is you're watching.The film starts off strongly enough featuring a thrilling sequence at the opera. The score shines brightly and Nolan's executes the scene to perfection. From there on the film placates us with smooth spy stuff type scene of the (literally named protagonist) the protagonist travels the globe and having fancy lunches and threating people to gain information. This all counts for nought as the film further gets into its hook, time travel. Its a relief that Nolan didn't go heavy handed with exposition like he did with Inception however with a plot this complicated some exposition would have been appreciated. The fil does try to explain the mechanics of the time-travel or as the film calls it 'inversion' however its difficult to comprehend given the blaring soundtrack that makes characters sound indecipherable.The film itself revolves around an attempt to prevent a world ending event (involving the future attempting to kill the past) and the main character and his comrades try to prevent it. The performances are just fine however this film is heavily plot driven so much so that we do not have much of a reason to invest emotionally in any of the characters, even John David Washington's suave wanna-be spy only serves to delight with his charisma but lacks in any other area. Robert Pattinson serves as a good enough partner to bounce of dialogue with even though he doesn't have much of a backstory either. The only other character with an emotional arc is Elizabeth Debicki's character and her battle with Sator, the villain. The arc would be a lot more engaging if not the fact that the character almost exists solely to be rescued by the male lead. Kenneth Branagh is absolutely menacing (unrecognisable?) as Sator. He's performance only been hindered by the fact that his actions and story deeply tied to the main hook of the film that I don't know what he's doing or how he's doing it only why, which is very frustrating. Overall the film is a technically marvellous film with fantastic staging of action scene but poorly explained mechanics and plot, shallow characterisation and an obnoxious sound mixing hinder the film from truly being a decent watch.",Tenet

I normally enjoy Christopher Nolan movies but this film is not close to Interstellar, The Prestige or The Dark Knight.It's a clever movie, but so clever it becomes confusing. I found Pattinson and Branagh to be very good in their roles. I found Washington boring and monotone. The cinematography and effects were top notch which was nice to see on the big screen.

Some movies are subject to comparisons with their rivals, but some aren't, simply because you'll never find rivals for those movies, no similar ideas, no such implementations ever done before, no such genre has ever been created before.Watch Nolan's movies and never try to compare them to anything else, Nolan creates his own genres, TENET is a totally new genre of movies, and a never before seen or felt experience, watch it and enjoy it.It doesn't matter whether you like the movie or not, the truth is TENET is incomparable to anything else ever done, if Nolan's movies are incomparable, then TENET is on the top of the list.Whether you left the theater in ecstasy or rage and hatred, be sure that the more you'll think about the magnificence of that feast, the more you'll love and appreciate this movie.",Tenet

The point of the story is finding out what the story is about. About 30 minutes in I no longer cared because it was so incredibly confusing that I had no choice but to give up on it.I could barely hear what the characters were even saying as they casually and all-too briefly brushed over super essential exposition in low monotone voices in between a mindless grind of nonstop moving parts. That went on for the entire movie. Blink and you'll lose track of the plot because it makes no sense in the first place.If you want to just watch something unfold for the heck of it and would rather not spend even a second reflecting on any of it while it happens, this is your movie.

3780,shahirusm,The benchmarks are so high,7,12 July 2021,"Although a great film, still the reason why Tenet didn't match the quality of other Nolan's mind boggling movies like Memento, Inception and Interstellar is the fact that it didn't portray much emotions as the previous ones. The concept was taken too far this time. When I am watching a Nolan's movie, the benchmarks are always high.So, I decided to compare it with his previous mind bogglers. Memento, Inception, and Interstellar.Emotionally;
In Memento the guy wants to find his wife's killers, Inception shows how a dad wants to be reunited with his kids, Interstellar is just on a different level where a dad has to sacrifice his own time with his beloved daughter to save humanity. Tenet didn't match those, however there were some emotions between Kat and her son Max where she need to get him away from his cruel dad Sator. But she gets to see him often which doesn't equal to being away from your loved ones in another world. Audience need to find some sympathy for a character which was missing in this film.Conceptually;
Let's compare Tenet with some of Nolan's previous films. In Inception, the concept of dream sharing, although not successfully done, is more believable than reversing the entropy of an object. Inception can be somewhat related to mind reading and hyptonizing. Planting an idea into a subject's mind. And there's no doubt about Interstellar's concept due to the presence of Kip Thorne in the production team. Memento took help from the studies of short term amnesia, and I don't think I need to explain the concept of this one.Conclusion;
A film is a film. It needs to make sure we are touched emotionally and mindfully by it. If you really need accuracy please watch documentaries. Tenet amazed me but not nearly as much as the previous Nolan's creations. There were mix of factors from the concept to emotions. But overall 7/10 is fair for the amazing cinematography, editing, acting, and of course directing.",Tenet

They're trying to ""keep up"" as the confusing world around them is shifting, and they're seeing things they can't explain.It's always bothered me in movies where the audience is one step ahead of the characters. You feel like yelling at the screen ""don't do it you idiot! It's obviously a trap!!""... we've all been there. We think the characters are idiots because we obviously understand something they don't.With Nolan movies that's not the case. We're just as lost as they are, and I love it!

Ok lets talk about the film, i agree that the background score is little bit annoying but other than that its great.

People are telling us we need to watch it more than once to get it. I literally do not have the time and nor should I have to watch something more than once to actually ""get it"".To be quite honest, I felt the entire movie had a B-Grade feel to it. I had to keep reminding myself this movie has some wonderfully experienced actors in it.For example, both Michael Caine and Robert Pattinson were absolutely flawless as someone else mentioned.For me, it was a case of, Washington simply doesn't possess the required acting chops to carry the Lead Role in this particular movie and whoever Cast him should see this as constructive criticism. Washington's complete lack of experience is glaringly obvious, and it was this, that adds to the whole overall B-Grade feel.This movie was so tedious to watch, not to mention the carpal tunnel I developed having to change the volume on the remote a gazillion times,It's very simple really, 1 star is too much for this film.

Extremely entertaining, full of hidden secrets, and gets even better after a second viewing, but there are two main problems with it which I'm deducting from what could have been a 10/10 score:1. The audio is horrible. You cannot hear half of what is being said throughout the film - this is unacceptable for such a confusing, chaotic and fast paced movie. I'm willing to forgive this if the problem is fixed when it becomes available for streaming/purchase and when subtitles can be turned on.2. Some scenes in this movie are way too chaotic and I could not tell why characters were doing what they were (exacerbated by not being able to hear what they were saying). This was purely because of what shots they decided to include in scenes - Inception did not have this problem. I would have liked to see more camera shots from the ""bad guys"" perspectives in a few scenes as one example of how they could have made it more obvious what was happening.",Tenet

The attention to so many small details in this movie is simply amazing and fully grasping them will probably require a second (or more) viewing. I will also warn viewers that MANY theaters nowadays struggle to properly mix sound and this movie is intended to have loud jarring moments that bad sound mixing will make brutal on the ears. I would say avoid watching this in an RPX or IMAX (the fake mini ones like AMC) as those tend to be some of the worst ones for thinking louder is the purpose of good speakers.The story of the film bends, weaves, and folds over itself in a spectacular fashion that will appeal to those of us who enjoyed reading ""A Wrinkle in Time"" as kids. Nolan will slow things down and zoom in the camera to call our attention to important details, but you're not supposed to know WHY they're important for awhile. Just be sure to file them in your memory bank and know most of them will have more than one reveal. The whole movie is peeling through layers, but not just to get to what's under them. Instead, it's like finding out you can put the layers back TOGETHER to form a treasure.If you enjoyed the movie ""Momento,"" you'll really enjoy this film. Don't try to solve it too quickly because that may lead to missing many of the hints that are right in front of you. Enjoy the action and deception, while you take it all in. This movie was clearly written to allow for something new on each re-watching and will most likely require at least two viewings.",Tenet

Oh dear!!,4,27 August 2020,"If you are booked in to watch this in IMAX then you will love the perfect picture quality as Nolan filmed this in 70mm for IMAX screens. Everything is clear, colourful and looks glorious. But if you value your ears then be warned. This movie is super loud! As IMAX sound systems are one of the best in the world you are going to be deafened by the explosions and movie soundtrack! Nolan is no stranger to blasting us with bass and there is a lot of booming going on, but at times it is tiring on the ears and he seems to have lost his way on this movie. I was so looking forward to this and the opening action sequence had so much promise until the movie title popped up and after that it was downhill.
If you think of this movie of not time travel but inverted time so reversing or controlling time from a past and present same reality but inverted then you will get the hang of it. I knew Nolan would twist things up and although the critics bang on about it not being time travel it does get mentioned a few times although we all know that it's practically impossible and the same person seeing themself in the same location would blow up the world or something like that! Once you have figured out what the hell is going on you realise that it still makes no sense even when they are explaining it in the dialogue - but as the effects and music is so loud some of the explanations are drowned out (something which the critic scolded Nolan for with Interstellar!).
Let's park that for now and focus on the movie content. Yes it does have action but comparing it to Christopher Nolan's other movies it is not on par, in fact it felt a bit light weight. We have a decent inverted car chase which was cool (yes you can drive a car at speed going backwards by just reversing the body shell, nothing new here folks!) and as mentioned the opening opera house hostage scene was epic. Fast forward to the ending scenes (no spoilers here) and it felt like a pathetic paint ball team building exercise with a bunch of red and blue team full face mask camo outfitted people wildly shooting and not a single baddie in sight! What the hell was that all about, really bad!
Then we have the actors;
John David Washington plays the lead ex CIA agent now world saving secret agent guy (yes he moved on that quickly to saving the world from destruction just after a quick chat with some shady guy - major editing room cut sequence I think!). This guy cannot act! He is so wooden and has no screen presence or charisma. Totally the wrong lead for this movie.
Robert Pattison (Twilight fame) is good but still a bit of a drip and hasn't shaken his Twilight stereo type image. He is playing the new Batman so I really hope he either beefs up or comes across less of a snowflake.
Kenneth Branagh is cool. He is the only actor throughout (Michael Caine had a 2 minute performance which was also brilliant) that provided a scrap of intelligent acting.
Elizabeth Debicki (playing Lady Di in the next series of Netflix's The Crown) was okay but not a character you would remember and easily lost in all the chaos thrown at you throughout the 2 and 1/2 hours!
This is a real turn for the worse for Nolan as he has brought us some fantastic movies, Dark Knight movies, Insomnia, Memento, Interstellar and Inception, but in my opinion this is one of his worst and I feel he has lost his way and just tried to dish up something visually amazing and loud (which is both) but sadly very poor plot and bad acting. Blowing stuff up, and trying to destroy the audience ear drums, does not make a great movie.
I did have to laugh as a group outside were saying it was great and it made sense - no it didn't, it wasn't made to make sense as no one knows about inverted real time versus past and present paradox's! I think Nolan has tried to outsmart the audience and for those that don't watch a lot of movies yes probably they will love it (like 1917 when everyone thought that was amazing but in fact it was more blowing stuff up, no plot and annoying dialogue but I agree visually stunning!)
If people are going to start thinking movies are all about the visually stunning cinematic movie sets and backdrops then perhaps they should watch some indie movies as that will provide them with weeks of ""wow that looks amazing"" but not so much gripping action. It's rare to get a movie that captures both the amazing visuals along with a great plot, sound acting abilities and captivating audiences by bringing them on the journey not trying to outsmart them like Nolan has attempted here, but ended up looking like a bit of a fool.
Some say watch it twice, okay yes you can do that if you don't understand it the first time but I did, and it wasn't good enough to warrant a second viewing, especially that I've damaged my hearing from movie watching and other activities over the years, don't need another Nolan onslaught! '
I do hope his next movie (Memento remake) is good - why do we need a remake of a classic fantastic movie Momento?",Tenet
3800,nikolaknezev,Spoilers! Sound mixing questionable.,7,4 September 2020,"The fake drawing being kept in a vault ? No point. I get that Kenneth wasn't happy for being tricked to buy a fake painting/drawing, but I see no point in keeping it, or why it would be a value for him or threat to Kate. That was lame excuse for the plot and lame reason for the team to to go into the vault, in the first place. With all the power Kenneth had in the world and against Kat (son) , drawing is just nonsense and flaw in the plot. Also, agree that there were poor voice sounds, compared to loud music. Theatre popcorn eating sounds were louder than actors voices, at the moments. I heard them, but it was a stretch. Finally, in the 25-35 minutes around the Kate being introduced and talked about the drawing, I almost fell asleep cause it was slow paced and stupid drawing story took unnecessary ample of time",Tenet

I've avoided watching any trailer and did not read any reviews since they tend to spoil the experience.The very first minute the movie started I was unable to understand what was going on, and I was unable to catch up to the unintelligible storyline.This has never happend to me before to this extend and it has ruined the entire movie for me.Every second I was asking myself: What is going on? Who is that guy? Where are they now? How did they get here? Why are they doing that? When did this happen?The very fast paced script, editing and overly loud soundtrack did not help to comprehend it either. Somehow I believe there is a very clever story beneath it all, but since the movie does not explain anything I could not care about any of it.Half way through the movie I gave up trying to wrap my head around it and by the end of the movie it left me frustrated and wanted to ask my money back.Movies like Inception and Interstellar can also be hard to understand the first time around and rewatching those movies has made them better.Maybe the same will happen for Tenet, but since the first experience was so horrible I'm not looking forward in rewatching it at all.I do hope these fast paced scripted and edited movies are not becoming a trend.",Tenet

3805,volkanbuluts,Average for Nolan,7,29 August 2020,"It looks like a ""classic"" Nolan movie so that opinion is not totally wrong. Nolan is fond of science-fiction and he is brave enough to try radical things about that. You can feel the self-confidence of Nolan in the movie. So ""Tenet"" includes a superior idea about time and inverting it. I really appreciate the idea but it isn't simplified so some of audience can find it too complex. Older ones, Inception, Interstellar vb. were more clear. Anyway, the end of story made it a bit more understandable.Nolan doesn't want us to interest with characters' background. This is Nolan's manner. Thats why we can't judge them. We don't know who is Andrei or his motivation totally. The Protagonist, John David Washington made a good job. Nolan's preference was right. Neil, Robert Pattinson made a good job too. Actually the best in the movie. So, acting is excellent of both.Music was very dynamic, fits in action; like before Zimmer did. Cinematography is also nice, Hoyte van Hoytema used to work with Nolan, great duo.Last of all, it is a nice movie to watch in cinema and enjoy action but by comparison with his older jobs this is an average work. Nolan has started to repeat himself.",Tenet
3806,bchminer,The end of cinema,1,5 September 2020,"With the Covid-19 pandemic killing off the cinema for the foreseeable future, a bunch of Hollywood executives got together and asked Nolan: Can you put the final nail in the coffin?Firstly, they loved the soundtrack so much that they made it louder than the dialogue so you can't understand key plot points. Secondly, it makes absolutely no sense. To give an analogy, they took an Inception level complicated story and then played it out like Memento but jumping back and forth playing things forwards and backwards then splicing other parts in when you least expect so you have no idea what's going on anymore and have no way to follow what's happening. The acting is monotonic and scripted.The soundtrack (8/10), cinematography (9/10) and special effects (9/10) are excellent, but without a comprehensible story and plot flow (0/10) it gets a final score of 0 out of 10. 0 times anything is still 0. Maybe it gets better with a second watch and understanding. However I won't be going back to risk Covid at the cinema for a second viewing.",Tenet
3807,craiginiowa,What a mess,1,18 September 2020,This movie was so hard to watch. In fact we walked out before it ended after determining that we had no idea what was going on. The audio was awfully the plot was....impossible to grasp. Don't waste your money on this one,Tenet

Anyway it's very simple. This movie is about two different timelines occurring at the same time. Same people, two different timelines, future and past. The ""present"" timeline is actually not at play here so don't wonder how can the past be the present and how can the future have an effect on the past or present. Again the ""present"" timeline is not at play here in this movie, it never exists. Here comes a SPOILER.... think of the future in past tense as if things have already happened and not as how they ""will"" happen. The Protagonist from the future went back in time to recruit and put everyone and everything in its place in order for things to happen just like they should. The Protagonist is the one pulling all the strings, he's the puppet master but his future self doesn't know it yet, he only realizes it once the mission is done and so he understands it's his responsibility to make sure everything goes according to the plan that worked in the future.",Tenet
3810,avikooijman,Impeccably crafted and mandatory rewatch,9,29 August 2020,"If you like movies that have a easy-rewatch-edge to them, you're in for a treat.I must admit, the first time I watched the movie I had difficulty wrapping my head around some of the main concepts and themes in the movie. Thus, I decided to just let the movie take me in for the ride and enjoy the visuals and soundtracks, and believe me, on that front it will easily suffice as well. Göransson did a wonderful job on the soundtrack and I was curious how they would implement the track produced by Hip Hop artist Travis Scott but this was done great as well.After a second and third rewatch I now realize I had it easy with something like Inception thinking that was complicated. All I can say is that I truly appreciate directors like Nolan willing to take complex stories as these and risk them on a huge budget. A large percentage of initial viewers will leave the cinema frustrated not understanding many parts of the films. Movie buffs however, will love it and will enjoy their second rewatch even more.
Last, my compliments go out to the cast, especially Washington who played a very convincing protagonist. Pattinson as well as supporting actor had great presence in his scenes without taking too much away from Washington.
For me, this movie is a 10. If you can keep me as engaged on the third rewatch as the first you have done something very special. Congratulations Nolan.",Tenet

I think that every thing about the story was well thought out and really liked the way the inversion worked. If you are a fan of time travel movies, this one is another to add to your masterfully done movies collection.I do have one thing keeping this movie from being a really excellent movie. Some thing that hindered my enjoyment of The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar and now Tenet. Christopher Nolan needs to get some one new to do his sound work or he needs hearing aids. Though most of this movie is had to guess what was being said. I kind of wish I could read lips, that really might have helped. I know that there are parts where I shouldn't be able to hear someone clear as a bell and I accept that, but even in some of the non action scenes it was really hard to hear what was being said.I suppose that the theater might have done something to the sound settings or maybe I am just getting old, but I don't have problems with other movies or TV, so why is it that mostly just those 3 movies, Rises, Interstellar, Tenet, do I experience the problem of hearing the characters?

It is a movie no one wanted.
It's a movie no one asked for.
There is no plot. There are no characters to care for. I couldn't care less what or why they are doing what they do. They're just random people doing random stuff.
There is ethos. No pathos. Very little logos.
It's just random stuff. Just like a music video.I wanted to say ""cool visuals"", but no. Not even that. It's just another bulk Michael Bay-ish movie, but not quite Michael Bay; more like those movies about mechanical aliens being buried in the oceans and come up and destroy stuff. Can't remember the name of those movies since I always fall asleep while watching them.And I fell asleep watching this.

There are a few nice action scenes and Nolan tried to get scientific time travelling ala Einstein into a hollywood blockbuster and failed because nobody of the intelligent anti-popcorn fraction (that he clearly wanted to reach out) is interested in such confusing stuff, that is just a big complicated construct of timezones. I won't watch it again. I was able to follow and check it at first time. No thanks! There is missing heart and soul behind all this tech.

The characters are often wearing some kind of mask , which makes it incredibly difficult to understand , what they say. The story is poor , but overall the movie lost my pretty much half way through.

3854,maximfilipenko,A mind-bending 'meh',5,27 August 2020,"Tenet is a visually stunning film with great cast and music that gives you goosebumps. What it really fails to do is to establish any meaningful emotional connection with the audience. The protagonist's motivations are flat and all ""we've seen it before"". Throughout the film you don't really have a chance to empathize with him. And the main ""villain's"" motivations are outright dumb. Nolan made me cry in his Batman trilogy not once, so it's even more disappointing to have characters with whom you cannot feel any sort of connection.That said, go to the cinema and watch the film yourself to make your own opinion about the story and enjoy the things I've described in the beginning of this review.",Tenet

However, I found the soundtrack perfect for the movie, I was completely immerged into the movie. I did not have problems to understand the dialogs. I realized that dialogs not important from background people were covered by the music (higher level), so you focus on the action. Then, when important to listen to the dialogs, the music was less loud).
The plot asks to pay attention and to probably rewatch it, to understand all layers. I guess that's what I like for this kind of movie. This is a well crafted movie, which respects the audience enough to explains the theory behind. If they would not have done this, people would have critized that it was not realistic or impossible.
I liked how it gradually increase the complexity as the protagonist finds out about inversion. The action scenes are amazing, I have never seen this before! I love how Nolan takes a genre and re-invent it with something new and challenging!",Tenet

I mean, this movie is a puzzle to solve and I enjoy solving puzzles.Overall, the movie is great : great cinematography, great acting, great action, etc. But it is, at first, indecipherable. People complain about the mumbling dialogs but it would not make any difference if every bit of dialog was intelligible. To get it anyway, you either rely on ""instinct"", as it is suggested in the plot, or you press repeatedly stop and rewind on any given passage to really understand what is going on (I have not figured out the car chase scene yet...).If you rely on ""instinct"", you'll get a beautifully shot and enjoyable action movie that leaves you totally confused at the end.

Aguti-09325 has already left an appropriate explanatory post. I'm not even done watching because it's pretty easy to see Protagonist ""meeting himself"" a few times in the movie and ""time skips"" especially around Kat.The characters and plots almost don't matter. The point is the collision of timelines, as aquatic-09325 has pointed out in his review.Robert Heinlein wrote a short story that reminds me of this movie called ""By His Bootstraps."" If you're having some difficulty wrapping your head around the movie, I recommend:1. Reading the review left by aguti-09325.2.

What i liked the most were the unique action sequences, the cinematography which was well done and the score which was fitted in this movie nicely.As for the things i didn't quite like, i wish characters had more depth, because i didn't feel attached to them, but i guess it's hard to do it in a movie like this. Another thing i didn't like was the sound mixing. The dialog was quiet while the score was very loud. Fortunately i had subtitles which helped to understand otherwise i would be lost.The movie was quite tense, with fast-paced action scenes, so if you're fan of that then it's a must see especially on IMAX screen.Overall i did enjoy it and i will definitely watch again to have better understanding, but right now i'd give this movie score of 6.9/10",Tenet

There are no emotional aspects in this movie, you dont know who the characters are at the end of it all. The movie is hevely plot(concept) driven.That being said, the movie is a visual masterpiece.

3876,leonhardwalhout,That feeling when you have to explain something super complex and the only effect it has plot-wise is how an explosion goes backwards.,6,23 December 2020,"The first thing I heard about Tenet was that one has to watch the Movie a second time to completely understand what is going on. When I heard this I was skeptical to this assumption because while Nolan movies certainly aren't short on dialogue explaining what is going on, most of them have a very standard Hollywood movie structure (or at least the once I saw which is practically all of them post Batman Begins). So I was curious to discover what this apparently complex had to offer (and this was the first big action movie that was in theater after the lockdown in the Netherlands). Turns out I was right and all the ""complex dialogue"" is just there to explain how the story gimmick works.Basically the people from the future have screwed over the world and send a machine into the past that inverts the flow of time so that the world ends and the future doesn't happen and an evil narcissistic Russian with cancer is willing to do that and the heroes have to stop him. This story is then used to have bland characters go through some well choreographed action scenes.While Tenet does have a pretty interesting premise with the time inversion gimmick it only enhances the way the movie looks and never to explore themes or develop its characters which have no room in the movie due to how much time the explanatory dialogue takes. Due to this the characters are about as interesting as your average children's movie side characters.What really saves this movie is the acting, editing and directing which makes the movie very entertaining to watch. The time inversion creates some pretty interesting visuals (especially during the finale) and together with the fighting choreography make this a very entertaining film to watch at the very least.While I'm very disappointed with the plot even when compared to other modern Big budget movies, it still held my attention on my first watching which can't be said about 70% of the movies I watch nowadays. If, for his next Movie, Nolan Hires someone who writes a plot with themes and interesting characters, we hire Hans Zimmer for the music and he directs the movie we could legitimately have one of the best American action movies of all time. But as it stands now he just makes visually stunning movies which have as much emotional depth as a Call of Duty game.",Tenet

3879,ianbrownlow-07366,I learned a lot from the reviews,9,13 March 2021,"First, the technical issue of the sound. Luckily I'd read the reviews that warned the mix makes hearing dialogue difficult. The opening sequences highlighted this. I solved the problem by changing my LG TV sound mode from ""cinema"" (my obvious preference for movies to ""clear voice iii"" which tries to pick out vocals. If you have this type of function, use it. If you can't follow the dialogue in a film you're always screwed, and in sci fi really so.Second, IMHO the story is not that complex. There's an undefined treat from the future. Hero follows breadcrumbs to a point in time trying to save the world. Hero retraces his steps back in time when he figures out how to save the world.Get that sound right and the movie makes sense, can be followed and is enjoyable. Leave the mix as it is and you won't know what the heck is going on simply because you can't hear the cast.",Tenet

Well a movie should made in such a way that it stays with the audience forever, but here that's definately not the case.

3882,garrotius,"If you're struggling, keep watching it.",10,16 January 2021,"There's a lot of invalid reasons people are giving bad reviews to this movie for. This movie is ahead of it's time and takes a leap of comprehension and attention to detail that hasn't been seen for a long time in film. The problem a lot of people have is it's not a typical movie for the masses to enjoy. This is art, and you'll need to do some work to get all the rewards from it. I believe the characters and emotional engagement is not an issue as some say it is. It's just done differently than people are used to. It's still there, it just doesn't attempt to try to connect with you and your expectations, but it's in an objective sense, very engaging. If you wanted more character development from the protagonist, I don't think you understand this movie. The main character doesn't need a selfish reason to do anything in this movie, he simply fights for the good of others in their behalf and that's a great hero type model that doesn't need their own backstory, personal experience or motives.
If you're not understanding the concept, you will get it if you keep rewatching the movie and noticing the details in the earlier parts of the film in light of knowing the later part of the film and so on. Again this film doesn't stoop to the audience's level to give them a free pass, the audience needs to rise to the mind is Chris Nolan to warp their heads around what they are seeing and that's why I call this art. You are introduced to the concept art a small scale and explained the concept. Then you get a a cracked up encounter with it and have to question what you just saw. Then your get to the red room and blue room and are taken for a ride in one of the greatest sequences ever filmed and have to think about what you're actually seeing and soon first seeing, you still won't understand it. This is so hard to achieve and be consistent and coherent, and it is pulled off without a mistake. Them for the rest is the movie your get that experience turned up to the max. This movie is objectively near perfection and that doesn't depend on opinions of the movie and what others got from it. It just is and will be a historical moment in film.",Tenet
3883,harrisazhar,TENET Classic......,8,19 September 2020,"Jean-Paul Sartre once said that the Great Literature is That Which Can Disturb You!
Now its meaning is that while you read anything, then that subject or plot and the characters involved in it do compel the reader to think ,to analyze ,to interpret and come up with other perspectives.
Now connecting it with the great Filmmaker Christopher Nolan and his great movies and the landmark ideas being presented in his movies.
TENET is the latest movie written and directed both by Christopher Nolan.First of all let me admit that it was a great moment for me to enter in the cinema hall after 07 Months due to the post COVID-19 situation, and the joy was amazing for me as a passionate lover and cinema lover for decades.during all the past 07 months I kept engaging with the concerned authorities to reopen the cinemas and I do take pride to be apart of this campaign.
Now coming to TENET, I must say Wowwwwwwww, What a great movie it is and it was just like to enter in the cinema with an empty mind with a curiosity and then coming out of it with your mind is being full with so many questions and the things needed to be discussed related to this great TENET Idea.I will not discuss the movie particularly as it would be a spolier, but what always amazed me after watching a Nolan's movie is that it always make you think, rethink and again to think to come up with the different perspectives. It is a feeling to think then being critical of that very thought and coming up with a different aspect or approach with a creative thinking to challenge your own idea, that is a beauty of a Critical, Creative, Scientific and a Philosophical thinking.Moving through time in different directions

The concept, based on some seriously shaky science, is OK but there are so many goofs in its implementation that I found myself having more fun spotting those than trying to follow the plot that managed to be both convoluted and obvious (such as the identity of the masked figure Protagonist is fighting, and the woman Kat sees diving off the yacht).
The numerous action scenes with some of the characters ""inverted"" were undoubtedly technically challenging to produce, but that doesn't make them entertaining to watch; they very quickly became tiresome.
Try as I might there were no combination of settings on our sound system that made the dialogue clear, so I resorted to disconnecting the bass speakers which helped to some extent, but overall there was just too much background noise and too many lines delivered into a mask. Just repeatedly going back to listen again probably took us over the 3 hour mark.

3906,mentallyentropicphilosopher,A Timeless Modern Classic,10,2 September 2020,"This is the greatest time-travel film I've seen for years. It doesn't have to contain too many alternate timeline like ""Primer"", or the ""Butterfly Effect"", but it's still mind-blowing in its own right. It has a somewhat similar feel like ""The Terminator"" and ""Predestination"", in the sense that there's a special force/ organization in the future who tries to prevent an apocalypse from happening and a character's backstory has an insane revelation. The acting here is top-notch, Robert Pattinson nailed it as Neil, he's going to be another perfect Batman just like Ben Affleck and Christian Bale, who coincidentally also portrayed John Connor with a rag-tag camouflage costume. John David Washington as The Protagonist was really dashing and fun to watch, and Elizabeth Debicki was the soul of the film. Just like many of Nolan's other masterpieces, this motion picture also features a lot fantastical and thought-provoking concepts, from dream within dreams (false awakening), Wormholes and Black holes in General Relativity, amnesia to justice, fairness, anarchism, randomness and the meaning of life, TENET is no exception, it has spectacular scenes where people and the environments are moving forwards and backwards simultaneously, or where agents could reverse the flow of entropy, or ponder over the destructive impulses of human nature, and kind of mimics the lesson in ""Interstellar"" and ""Star Trek"", whether it's better to trust your reason and rationality or your instinct, your heart versus your brain. The script is brilliant, with cerebral themes and elegant ideas, like free will, determinism, faith in the future, consequentialism, the human condition, and so on. It's a lot different from ""Terminator"" and ""Back to the future"" as those subscribe to the hypothesis of multiple timelines while TENET, just like ""Harry Potter"" and ""Predestination"", does not, so there are insane implications, like the past might not be changed, and from that we have to face responsibility of our actions. It also deals with contemporary concerns like climate change, nuclear weapons, social inequality, and more. The visual effects are eye-opening and insane, unlike anything ever seen in cinema. The cinematography is enthralling, even the cuts are seamless. To the critics who said this film is cold, sterile and emotionless, have you seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey""?
I don't even know what the actual hell was the version that you saw, but from my timeline, TENET is NOT, by any means emotionally distant. It might be inaccessible and sophisticated to some viewers, but not emotionless at all. So you mean to freaking tell me, that Neil and the Protagonist's eventual end of their friendship wasn't touching? Or that Neil willingly sacrificing himself for the greater good of mankind and dying the same battle over and over again wasn't heart-breaking? Or their farewell to each other wasn't heart-warming and powerful? My theatre literally stood up and cheered seeing what a hero Neil was. Did you even see Elizabeth's character endure through the pain of her tortures? Did you look into her eyes that brilliantly expressed agony and pain through her tormented glances and still managed to tell me it's emotionally detached? It was freaking intense. And swear to me the villain's death by Elizabeth's heroine wasn't empowering and satisfying to watch? It was her character's arc and officially established her as strong female character, even better then Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor. Who the hell cares if The Protagonist doesn't have an alter ego.

3908,tykotamminen,Tenet is a good movie even tough i didn't fully understand it (yet),10,27 August 2020,"The cinematography, score and acting are amazing, exactly what you can expect from a Nolan's movie. Ludwig Göransson did a fantastic job in mixing backround ambience for action and traveling and clearer themes for the important moments just the right amount. Hoyte Van Hoytema captured probably the best car chase scene of the Year and the acting was also fantastic but the characters didn't have much of a backstory. They played really well the role that what was written for them but a little bit of backround would have been nice to bring deeper motives and storylines to the movie.The story was typical Nolan in a good way, but i think that there was a little too complex logic to to be digested in a two and a half our movie.Typically when i watch movies with scifi elements, i try to figure out the logic that the writer was thinking but this time I just accepted that i wasn't going to figure out the whole plot during the first time watching so i just sat down and enjoyed the ride.

3909,mgoldberg-60041,Has Potential yet flawed,9,1 September 2020,"As a very big Nolan fan, I had extremely high expectations for this film going in. The movie started off with a bang, but the dialogue was pretty bland in the sense that it was trying to set the plot but was doing a terrible job with very sophisticated ideas thrown at you too fast for you to soak in. Beginning of the movie was very hard to understand and frankly I was very confused until about halfway in ( the very loud music and loud action scenes made it very hard to hear much of the dialogue throughout the movie)
Things got very interesting halfway through and I really began to get comfortable with the plot and sophisticated ideas when even MORE extremely detailed plot points appeared.
Too much details at the wrong points had me very confused by much of the movie.
But despite all this, even the amount of information that I soaked in on the first watch told me how great this movie really could be if watched properly. Even though some aspects were hard to keep up with, I would hardly call myself disappointed. This movie has much potential with brilliant ideas and just needs to be watched correctly. When understood properly, the true genius of Nolan can be seen.",Tenet

If you love cinema by Nolan you will enjoy this masterpiece as well. He continues his approach of defining time and reality as he did with Inception and Interstellar however, this time he made it more complex by using different time lines in the same room/situation/present. I will definitely watch this movie over and over again as I did with his other movies because there are so many details that it is impossible to catch them all at once. As always very good score/atmosphere and a good selection of actors especially, John David Washington and Robert Pattinson made a perfect duo. Hope to see more movies by him!

The self-fulfilling plot devices continue on and on until the villain's motive-reveal party, which although was clearly one for the 'you almost caught me monologue-ing' record books, could not be understood above the din of Dolby's desire to produce seat shaking sound.
Hollywood complications aside, with TENET you can't even let suspension of disbelief develop in action-movie-mode because Nolan seems completely disinterested in making TENET live up to his own standards. Honestly, the movie's climatic fight scene seemed to be gathered from the cutting room floor of a 1970s era James Bond film... It was made-for-TV awful.Why even five stars? I could say some are due to the gratitude for being back in a movie theatre (to be one of three at a 6:00 pm showing was its own experience) but the stars are earned by Washington who demonstrates the chops to make the shortlist for inheriting the Bond franchise. Add to his screen-presence a charismatic bromance with Pattinson and a #metoo appropriate approach to Debicki and it is clear to see you don't need a second viewing to understand what Nolan is trying to show you.",Tenet

A pity as Christopher Nolan has other great and much better movies (and scripts) behind, like Memento or Inception.The film fails trying to give the plot an interesting weight based on conversations full of technicalities that do not lead to any very logical conclusion and with characters that follow the typical archetypes: superhero with cockyness who deciphers security codes like someone who adds 2 + 2, a bad histrionic who of course wants to end the world just because he is dying, mixed with an ecological none sense theory (and that has an army of people who support him ??) and a victim woman to help, of course, with zero charisma and quite cold during all the footage, who is supposed to fight and live just for her son (who almost we don't even see in the whole movie), no much better plots for the rest of the roles...The ending lacks any tension since you know that everything is going to work out well.

The villain was, well typical and the motivation was regular.They thought emotions were being delivered, but NO they were not.

1. Much of the critical dialogue you need to hear to at least half way understand what's going on was impossible to hear or understand, either because of heavy foreign accents, because of masks being worn, or because the dialogue was just overwhelmed by the noise of the action and the soundtrack.
2. The above is only a big problem because the plot is so dang confusing. At least half of the story line is really lost because you're still trying to figure out what happened in the last scene.I had high hopes for this film. Saw it in the pre-release. Paid extra to see it in the big XD theater, which I never do. But as a huge fan of Inception, I was super looking forward to the film. I even had silly hopes there might be some overt connection to Inception (didn't really expect it though). And honestly, it seems like Nolan made it confusing on purpose. Well, ok, maybe it's like avant-garde art where everyone looks a blob of paint and pretends how amazing it is, but I can't do it.As I said at the beginning, it's worth seeing, just because it is still an ""event"", and I'm sure I'll see it again on the small screen to see if I can make more sense of it all, but just go into it with your expectations in check.",Tenet

I can't imagine how Nolan directed the actors to play the characters with such a plot, and such heavy dialogues.
I don't think anyone would have been able to execute such a plot, conflict, and make a cohesive film out of this fictional universe.
This film took the spy film genre and gave it the biggest rewamp. Tenet is Memento, Inception, and Dunkirk combined inside a James Bond film.
Nolan's goal is always to make people come to cinemas. He makes cinematic masterpieces that force people to come together, in a room, and enjoy it together. And that's why I think this film was successful in what it wanted to accomplish. This makes me want to rewatch it. Again and again.
We have cinema screens because of films that earn so much, that employ so many people. We need blockbusters, and this one is the best kind of blockbuster.
To be unbiased, I will also mention the places I think it lacked, which were emotionally strong characters, and an emotional grip on the film, which Inception and Interstellar mastered. This film had an insane storyline, and to be honest, I don't think it needed emotionally charged characters. This was pure adrenaline filled, large screen, sci-fi action packed entertainment, in one of the most complicated narrative driven films.
If I would have to rate it, I'd give it a 10/10. This wasn't my favorite Nolan film to watch, but is still going to be an unforgettable one. This film achieved it's goal. This film will be in the history books for contributing towards keeping cinema alive.",Tenet

3957,koyicatfishsiyi,From Taylor sequence to Tenet (just for fun),8,12 September 2020,"""So far as the theories of mathematics are about reality, they are not certain; so far as they are certain, they are not about reality.""
-Albert Einstein
---------------------------------------*spoiler*---------------------------------------Coincidentally, a few days ago I searched some content on Taylor sequence before I watch Tenet again. Of course, my knowledge about math back in college was broken, and I'm only here to give some personal reflections on this title. This is just for fun.The assumption of my deduction is: The algorithm (9 parts as a whole) is able to calculate the analytic solution of the intact timeline. An analytic solution is a closed form, so as the timeline, it's head to tail and is perfect. Given the algorithm and the technology developed by ""future human"", the combination of the two can then inverse the entire world. And this is exactly the reason why we need the algorithm to resolve the timeline function perfectly-every point on the timeline need to be predicted accurately and certain.So here our protagonist sits at a point on the timeline in the future, for some reason he needs to travel back to prevent the combination of the two--algorithm and inverse technology. Every time he came back to the past to make a small change can be considered as another superposition of term.
As we know, the analytic solution function can equate to the sum of its Taylor series near a certain point. The series is infinite, meaning more superpositions make a better approximation, to some acceptable extent. But sometimes, if the series of superpositions are not chosen properly, as in the movie--the event circle is not closed, the result of the sum would be divergent. This can cause the reality to be instable, and the future will no longer be close to the previous future.So, every time, as our protagonist comes back to finish the mission, he needs to make sure that their segmentation of timeline is closed and intact, like a circle. And at the same time, they need to successfully carry out the mission. Time is segmented into circles, and circles in circles.(About the causality: the analytic solution is like other mathematical axioms, it already exits, only to be discovered by human. So as the result, or the future. From the axioms, as from the future, we deducted backwards along our past timeline using approximation. In a certain small range, the approximation can be said as equal to the true resolution, which is harmonic. So the world is harmonic, as long as the infinite terms of superpositions come to a convergent value, to form a closed circle together with the cause.)Question: This may sound like ""Turtles all the way down"", but I still want to explain the process. As we know, Taylor series use the derivatives of a single point to make approximation. The layers of derivatives can implicate the change rate of the lower layer function. As the protagonist and his allies travel backwards making contact with the past, this becomes the natural source for gaining the change rate of the events. The friction they feel is then used by them to make decisions. So, I would like to understand the approximation as a natural thing happening constantly during the inversed process.",Tenet
3958,albinbahs,"Do you like unique movies? Then this is the one. People giving this movie a bad rating, please read this review, maybe you'll understand the movie even more.",10,1 December 2020,"Did you enjoy watching Interstellar, Inception, The great Gatsby, Fight Club, V for Vendetta, The Matrix trilogy, or even movies like Bird Box or Escape Room? Then this UNIQUE movie is for you!The movie is complex, the sounding is in some scenes very annoying and if you don't like to focus during a movie, watch your phone during the film, or always goes to the bathroom because you tend to buy the largest soda your cinema has to offer, then this is not for you! The casting is beyond perfect, David and Robert were impressive, and the legendary Christopher Nolan has delivered once again.The movie's concept is very, very cliché. One man needs to save the world, there's a girl - there is always a girl - who makes everything more complicated, always more complicated. There's a big bad Russian oligarch, he's Russian what did you think? And you can maybe guess the rest, or probably not...David gets recruited after a heroic act early in the movie, to be the person that can help stop this Russian man from destroying every thing we cherish. It is not a Nolan movie if it does not get complicated. What people are moaning about in the reviews all over the world is that the time traveling concept is too hard to gasp. Well, let me tell you this, if time travel was easy to explain, and easy to do, then we would have done it in real life as well. I'm sure that almost everyone in the world have seen a time traveling movie of some sort, please can you name one movie that actually uses the laws of the physics to describe this phenomenon to make it as ""real"" as possible (Interstellar is an exception) such as Nolan does? Movies have, since the beginning of cinema, painted a reality before where someone can go back in time. We have seen portals, time machines and other ways to do it, but here, this film stands out among all the mainstreamers. Nolan uses the physical laws of time inversion where entropy is the central concept where instead of a person being transported through time, an object of a special precious metal is transported instead, and the person follows the backward energy, let me explain.I think the following explanation of the concept of entropy is what these critical reviewers would have wanted in the film to understand
Entropy is a physical concept that determines the very movement of that energy redemption between two or more objects. See it as ice cream and temperature, if you eat ice cream in the North Pole, the ice cream will not melt by the ambient temperature. But if you are in a hot country, the ice cream will melt due to the high temperature. In the heat, the ice cream melts and cannot return to its previous form because entropy (energy from the transformed form) cannot decrease naturally from the same source of resources, however, the melted ice cream can be converted to ice cream if you take it to the North Pole, sort of. In the film, they can thus go backwards with entropy, which creates this time inversion. So you are involved in the same movement and power and theoretically your body mass is moved through time, this is practically not possible. If this was possible, as it is in the movie, then you can act fairly normal while the rest of the world goes backwards. So it's wrong with your bodily movement, not the world's. The world is still in the center, the weather, the climate, gravity and other factors are still there, but instead of feeling the wind in your face, you now move backwards in the energy, which makes you feel like you are always going downwind. That is why, in the final scene, half of the soldiers in blue, fight in real time and in real motion because that was their reality but also the worlds since they did not time travel, while the red team had ""transported"" themselves and got to experience and fight the battle backwards. The red team goes out to fight in an entropy (backwards) and the blue time in the present time (now). What also confuses these reviewers is how these people who use these portals can be sure that they themselves in the future or in the past have used the portals. This is where the grandfather paradox comes into play. To make it simple for you, you simply do not know when, how or why it happened, it just did. Did the chicken or the egg come out first? It's the same principle, some things have no explanation and so is the reality. The fact that Nolan exploits this paradox and real physical laws to paint a time portal is outstanding. It gives an insight into how dedicated this fantastic director is to changing the film industry. Some of us just can not understand it yet, maybe our future self will come to explain it to us, who knows.",Tenet

This film can be a little bit confusing, especially in the first hour or so, however, if you just relax and take it all in, the film will end up explaining little moments that will come back in glorious fashion.The acting in this movie is EXCELLENT. John David Washington is so great in this film and his fight scenes will be in my mind forever. There is one fight scene in a hallway that is more mind blowing than the hallway fight scene in Nolans previous film Inception.The inversion aspect of this film definitely plays a large role and is so fascinating to watch in these amazing, nail biting action sequences.This is, in my opinion, probably the most insane action film I have ever seen.I'm rating this 10/10 stars. This is such a great film. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this at an IMAX theater like I did.",Tenet

He tries again, you try again.Completely understand the fact that why one should invest double triple the time for a movie. But, that just is part of the experience. If you want to have it or not, it's your choice.About the movie, Nolan's a genius. We should be glad, we get to watch movies that has brilliant execution, experimental and conceptual.There is no extraordinary plot to the movie, no background of characters like there is no background story of James Bond. The whole movie is set in a limited time frame and for a limited task.Although this movie has so so many puzzles and clues left here and there, that you could sit and think of a possible plot. There are so many clues that beg for a sequel. I would love one but I don't think Nolan is one who would work on a sequel.Great movie! Watch it.... twice.",Tenet
3967,afshinshareati,Afshin Shariati,9,7 December 2020,"Hello, dear ones
Here I want to point out some points in Christopher Nolan's film Tent that you probably did not notice.
This movie is about the ability to reverse time. Well, so far the name of the movie
TENET
Did you pay attention? This word is made the same word from every side that is read. Tip 2 Well, based on the movie, it is enough to take this name in the same way, that is, capital letters in front of the mirror, which means that you are actually reversing the word. This is exactly the same. There is a logo that was supposed to be used for the film, but due to its resemblance to a company's brand logo and copyright laws, the film was not given to the film even after being offered the right to use this type of writing by the brand owner. This is exactly the text that was supposed to be used on the cover of the film. Do you see a line in the middle of the image? What do you see before the line? written
TEN
Well, now look at the second part, which has been reversed. Again, what do you see if you look at it in reverse? again
TEN
Well now
TEN or (10)
What does it mean in the film?
The number ten is repeated many times in the film, some of which I will mention
First of all, early in the film, the protagonist (John David Washington) tells Neil (Robin Pattinson) that I only want 10 minutes to meet Sanjay Singh.At the end of the film, each is divided into two groups, a group that enters the area normally, that is, from the real world, and a group that enters the area through reversed time, and each has 10 minutes.
The first group started their operation at 10 o'clock for 1 hour, ie 10 to 11 o'clock
At 11 o'clock, the second group completes their operation 1 hour behind, that is, until 10 o'clock
So what does 10 mean to Nolan?
1. The script of the film ""Indoctrination"" has been written for 10 years.
2. Indoctrination of the movie was released in 2010.
3. 10 years after the movie Indoctrination, ie 2020, the movie Tent was released.
4. He has directed 10 other films before Tent Nolan.
5. Tent film has been shot in 7 countries for 3 months (total of 10 pieces)
6. Nolan spent 5 decades (10) of his life at the time of the film's release and has become like a new decade (10) of his life.
It is not clear how many of the above examples are intended by the director himself.
But whatever it is, the number 10 has a special meaning for the director.
It is said that the closest meaning in Persian to the name of the film is ""Angashteh"".
The idea, the idea, the certainty of other translations of the film
Maybe the name in the movie means that
1. The protagonist, according to an official at the beginning of the film, is dead after eating the film and thinks he is alive.
The protagonist is convinced that the world is in danger and causes him to get involved.
3. At the end of the film, he is given the impression that he himself is the initiator of this story at another time.
4. He thinks that the world is being destroyed, which may not be the case. In fact, he has helped another group that intends to create chaos.
It is very likely that this movie will continue, because the device that causes the destruction of the world has not been destroyed either.
We may see a new dog from Nolan.
1. In the middle of the movie, Hein shows our spies the number three of Sator's car chase.
Note that it may indicate the number E 2. If you pay attention to the inverted name of the movie, the letter
3 in order to be triple.
3. At the end of the film, three people share the destroyer piece.
4. The film talks about 3 different times: present, past and future in order to be triple or to continue the film
At the end of the film, Neil tells the protagonist that he will see the adventure again at the beginning
Here are two points that come to mind:
1. At the beginning of the film, the doctor says, ""This technology has come from the future to the present.""
2. At the end of the film, Neil tells the protagonist, ""You have a great future in the past.""
If the film continues, the above two sentences make it difficult for us to understand whether the next film will take place in the past or in the future.
A sentence is heard at the beginning of the film
Protagonist:
we live in a twilight world
And in response
and there are no friends at dusk
Translation: We live in a world of dusk and we have no friends in it
1. If we consider twilight in the world of espionage. The second sentence implies that we can not trust any of the spies in the film, for example, Neil says that the protagonist himself has hired him. He has more information and hides things from him. He may have been hired by the protagonist himself, but his goal is not to save the world, and this story is hidden from him in the past.
2. Twilight World is the name of a song from
swing out sister
Is in the lyrics of the song from the end of time and distrust of the world of dusk. And in the music video, he sometimes moves in the opposite direction and dances.
If you pay attention to the whole film, from the very beginning, the characters from the future are present in the beginning of the story by reversing the time, which will be revealed to us in the continuation of the film.
If you look closely at the director's own film ""Interstellar,"" at the beginning of the film Matthew McConaughey's daughter insists that the sands want to communicate with her, but her father does not pay attention. After a while, they realize that the sands show spatial coordinates. At the end of the film, it is revealed that it was Matthew McConaughey who is in a relationship to help himself or his daughter.
Now, in the movie Tent, we may see a series of events at different times that are constantly repeated. Isn't it clear that we saw several loops from this chain during the film? Maybe the beginning of the chain
Whatever it is, the film continues in my opinion.
Considering Nolan's previous films, such as Indoctrination, in which there were points in that film as well, it is not unlikely that the above points are true. Understanding whether it is true or not determines it at the same time.
In an interview, Christopher Nolan said, ""I want all the fans and viewers of my work around the world to see the film and each of them to express their opinion about the film.""Author: Seyed Afshin Shariati",Tenet

Great script but with too many confusing concepts for a movie.
I applaud Nolan's attempts to explore the weirdness of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity in his movies, but he needs to keep in mind that his takes on those fascinating and exciting subjects are nearly impossible to comprehend and follow by average viewers even if they read a 500 page book explaining the plot prior to watching Tenet movie...",Tenet

Personally I spend a lot of time studying space, time, and physics in itself. From my perspective I found this movie a masterpiece. The physics involving the reversal of time are phenomenal. Everything makes sense. But enough of me flexing my understanding of the film.The film itself is pieced together fantastically. You are guaranteed to be confused throughout the whole film, which is what Nolan wanted to achieve. But paying close attention throughout the whole film, everything will make sense. Every scene is a crumble being pieced together to form a whole at the end of the movie.I won't spoil anything but I can say that this is a must-watch. I see a lot of negative reviews of the film here, yet the arguments for the film being ''not up to expectations'' aren't quite solid. 90% of the reviews here are not written by people who are very invested with the movie and the masterpiece hidden within the movie. Also these reviews seem to complain a lot about the audio mixing. Personally I didn't have any trouble hearing the dialogs in the movie. There were some times where the music would be much louder than the person speaking, but this only occurred when the dialog wasn't of any importance to the movie.As said this is a must-watch, and yet another masterpiece from Nolan. I don't have any complaints towards the movie and this is why I'm giving it a 10/10. Best 2,5 hours of my 2020 so far.

If you watch his films you are used to jump from one scene to another without big conversations or explanations which usually is ok, because somehow it makes sense. But tenet is jumping from one scene to another without making any sense. It starts in Kiev, goes on at the baltic sea, to England, India, Finland, Estonia, Vietnam and Italy. The plot is as diffuse as the choice of locations. It's told that there is the threat of a weapon which can invert time and it can cause the third world war. But while watching it i never understood it. How can it cause the world war? Who will use it? Why is it more dangerous than nuclear weapons? While watching it in the theater i thought i was missing a hint but reading the plot after the movie ended i thought it was a joke how non stringent the plot is.

This movie was the ultimate test for that. If there was an Oscar award category for movies made to intentionally confuse you, then this would have won by miles. There is just so much happening so fast during the complex scenes that you will surely miss most of the details through the first watch. This movie warrants at least 3 watches to really catch all the plot.

4016,therealtestmann,A time travel Bond movie,8,30 August 2020,"As always when it comes to those hyped movies I ask myself will it live up to the high expectations? To me it doesn't. It is a good movie though. The acting of all main characters is good and is topped by Kevin Branagh's outstanding performance. But it is not top notch worth 10 points. Maybe I expected something like those never before seen visuals as in Inception. I also expected the concept 'Tenet' (what is it anyway?) to be picked up and detailed throughout the movie, but it didn't.
As for the time travel aspects of the movie I don't know if I understood them completely. Maybe it is worth a second watch as stated in other comments. But I don't know if I will give it another try. Maybe it is the slow pace at the beginning which may be boring on a second view.
The thing I expected least was that it could be watched as a Bond movie, as there are many ingredients as: The bad guy who wants to destroy the world, his female lover to which our protagonist develops a relationship, nice places all over the world, the climax in which the bad is defeated, over the top stunts, the main character being introduced to several bad guys, dining with them and being threatened at the same time, ...
So overall it is a good movie but not what I expected and not that great it deserved a 10 rating.",Tenet
4017,andrerbailey,I got it. But I Don't Like it!,2,5 September 2020,Too long. Seeing the same scenes repeatedly is annoying and boring.Too complicated with no real explanations that make sense. The story unfolded slowly and poorly which hindered viewers' investment in accepting the aspects of the sci-fi paradox. There are many times the rules of physics seem to change in different scenes for the sake of having a desired action scene.The sound was a wall of noise that leaves the viewer exhausted and wincing to hear each word.Shallow characters. The characters have little to no backstory and no development. The viewer is supposed to accept that the main character is already the smartest guy in the room who outwits everyone while also being a master soldier who can kill anyone in his way.Not a fan. I think I'll re-watch Inception again to forget about this one.,Tenet

HAWT.The BADSThe sound was terrible, and I don't think it was just the theatree, as I heard (out there) others also critical of the sound. Much of the dialogue was drowned out, but the kicker was that some of the dialect was also difficult to understand - combined, I missed about 1/20 of the dialogue in the movie. They could have had subtitles....it's like they didn't even watch the movie after they made it. Sound Stars: 2/10Not rated R. Should have been rated R. This is an adult movie for adults. There could have been at least a little sexual tension between the leads. So it was really a soft PG-13. Very few childrens under the age of 17 would understand it anyway.Too (Unnecessarily) Long. 2 1/2 hours??? Cut out 45 minutes. I knew it was going to be that long, and after 2 hours I said to myself, ""WRAP IT UP."" It would have been a much more enjoyable experience if I watched it from home (with subtitles).Over presentation of confusing action sequences. Yes, the effects were great and the action was good, however, towards the end, I was just confused...my brain shut down, and I just said, ""Is it over?""Way too much confusing information / too complex. I wouldn't say I'm ADD - shoot I focus for a living -, but 2 1/2 hours of blindsidingly fast information delivery is...???...it's just takes away from the overall entertainment of the movie.I think I would liken the movie to a modern Octopussy or View to a Kill (both JB).So the movie was good, really good, but there was a lot wrong with it too.(going to the movie theatree is fun!!!)",Tenet
4023,sangerer-90756,I can't rate it higher after seeing Dark,8,30 August 2020,"Of course Tenet is a great film. Of course Christopher Nolan brings us amazing visuals and great acting. But I can't help myself and be a little disappointed and I think this is because I am more into the topic than in any other Nolan film I watched, mainly because of my admiration of the Netflix series Dark, where they thematized the topic 'time' with perfection. I have watched Tenet just once and I surely missed much, I think every time I watch this movie, I could find some details which are connected to something. Just like Dark, everything is connected, the perfect loop. But Dark goes one step further and sends the protagonists on a journey to change the loop. In the case of Tenet, the antagonist would succeed at first by destroying the world and the protagonists have to change the timeline to stop him. But no, in Tenet they 'only' have to learn how to obey or kind of just be in this perfect loop and everything will be fine for them. Of course the end of the world is not possible in this scenario and it confuses me how the antagonist is not able to understand that. During the film I thought ""of course they succeed, we have already seen the girl jumping from the boat"". When he already has lived at let's say the 20th of June, how can he think ending the world at the 10th of June would be a good idea? It is his future and he does it in his mind the first time, but it is the worlds past and if the world surpassed the 10th of June one time and he saw that, how didn't he know that none of his action would change that. Everything happens over and over again just like it's used to be, which is the main point of Dark. Tenet sends us on a journey to watch a perfect loop where everything is determined from start to end. The ability to travel backwards in time is a cool visual addition, but it's mainly some 'eye candy' for me, it just looks cooler than travel back with an old fashioned time machine and change the actions in your way the second time you are part of it. I assume it also is more likely to happen according to physics, but I don't know anything about that, and it doesn't change my movie experience if something is possible in some way in real life or not. The last negative thing I would like to point out is I would have liked the story to be a little less chaotic and fast paced. It was hard for me to emotionally empathize with the main characters while they are doing something which I don't really understand but it seems like it's necessary to stop the old fashioned bad guy and saving the world by not letting the ""world destroying machine"" doing so. All in all the film is a visual masterpiece, I really enjoyed watching, or better, seeing it and I am sure when you disassemble the film in his individual parts, everything is connected and it is a great story with all the little details hiding from me at my first watch. But everybody who is really interested in watching great storytelling I would highly recommend watching Dark, where in terms of sophistication and complexity, Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese are, in my opinion, a step ahead of Nolan.",Tenet
4024,sanbitgames,"Like any other big brain Nolan film, but worse.",6,6 December 2020,"The main storyline is very simple. A man tries to stop the world's destruction. The dialogues are flat.

4025,dhanishtaa,Rushed and hectic,3,6 June 2021,"Christopher Nolan is a great director. Period. Tenet was supposed to be another gripping sci-fi thriller and repeat the success of many of his landmark films- Inception, Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige: you name it. But much to my disappointment, this movie turned out as if the filmmaker was on a time crunch.Nolan's movies are vague, but vague to the extent that leaves the audience asking for more. This one, however, does not even properly elucidate the magnitude of the situation, which inevitably makes the rest of the movie seem meaningless. Also, as many others have pointed out, the score is boisterous, which does not allow the viewer to focus properly on the storyline and the complex concept of reverse entropy on which the film revolves. Nolan's idea is raw and original, but there are serious glitches in the way it is showcased. Also, unlike other Nolan movies, the questions left by Tenet are not pressing but redundant, as are many of the characters and a large part of the dialogue. And considering the fact this was his most expensive venture, I pray that the next Nolan movie is everything what Tenet was not: a gripping thriller, a convincing moral allegory, and an all-absorbing ode to the complexity of the world and human nature.",Tenet
4026,rasmussavic,Great action - not so great storyline or character development,7,24 August 2020,"The concept of the film is extraordinary. Or, the concept of the science fiction part of the film.*While being thrown into a universe where time and space seizes to work as you're used to, there's a complete lack of character introduction. Lack of an understanding of what's at stake - more than ""the end of the world"". Which makes the film more for the eye than for the heart.There's an antagonist - with clear motives.
There's a protagonist - with clear motives.
But how either of them ended up facing the other one is something most of us needs to Google if we care to find out.The action is thrilling and the visual effects amazing, not to mention the inversion thingy.

Firstly, after the long cinema closures it was good to be a cinema goer again. Secondly, a promised reopening with a highly built up film from the Director of Inception, was certainly going to be worth donning a mask for.
Well, it wasn't. The storyline was faulty, the tooing and froing causing initial confusion, which evolved into complete boredom before the final scenes arrived.
The film came across as a feeble attempt at hitting a highly complex sci-fi action thriller with a mesh mash of crazy, unrealistic ideas.

The whole movie was cut after cut after cut jumping from one location and one heavy scene to the next. Due to this characters have next to no depth as literally the whole movie is mindless action and I could not care less about who lives or dies.The dialogue is terrible with sporadic attempts at comedy and it felt like I was watching a first script reading, not the finished product.The audio is muffled and constantly drowned out by the soundtrack (Lidwig Göransson manning the soundtrack is the only reason this movie doesn't get one star).There's hugely illogical scenes, i.e. a character trying to get out of a crashing car by reaching for the furthest door handle away from them on the opposite side of the car their attempted rescuers are on. The character then at the very last second manages to open the door they're sitting by using their tied up hands. Not to mention the countless times ""The Protagonist"" happens to have access to random fire trucks, boats, cars etc with no explanation.This movie is the love child of someone who loves Vin Diesel and a pretentious Rick and Morty fan who uses television and movies to prove their superior intellect.",Tenet

Add 1980's sci-fi type music
Job done!
As you can see this movie hasn't done much for me. I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan but this one falls flat on it's face. Although confusing I did grasp the gist of it but I feel like i just watched 2.5 hours of the A Team with some stuff happening in reverse.

4035,nonamefilmsllc,Momento on Steroids,7,1 September 2020,"Tenet uses the boomerang effect of time delineation, very similar to Nolan's previous film ""Momento"". But time, is dependent on the plot. The plot involves the character's free choice of will, as stated a few times throughout the film, including Neil. Neil, played by Robert Pattinson, gives the greatest range of human emotion and characterization, even within such a fast-paced film. The constant action and reaction, always increasing, along with a unique look at how time works, with masterful editing give the audience an enjoyable experience. However, walking out of the theater the whole viewing seemed pointless. Sure, there were deep moral conflicts and sacrifices, along with love, not just romantic, but refreshingly fraternal love. And yet, in the end the plot held little meaning for me. It showed stereotypical conflicts and resolutions, within a world that only Nolan could design. But as Nolan makes more films there is a hope, I believe, within all of us, that his character's take on a humanity of their own. Instead, especially after watching this film, it felt like leaving a surgery as an intern. There was a body, and all of its parts, its science, and facts, but I never saw a smile, never noticed a tear, and I walked away, knowing that clinically that person is okay, but mentally, spiritually, I will never know. Because I was never given the chance to know. All I did was watch - but never felt.",Tenet

4040,jinfantino,"Disappointing, but still okay",6,9 September 2020,"I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan. I admire his commitment to practical effects as well as to original, thought-provoking storytelling on an epic scale.
His latest film, Tenet, has all of those aspects, but it's missing everything else that makes Nolan's movies so great.
When looking back at Dunkirk, his previous film, Nolan seemed to have shown considerable restraint compared to his usual storytelling style. Whereas in Inception and Interstellar, he creates these enormously complex plots, necessitating the characters to overexplain to the audience what is happening in nearly every scene, Dunkirk is arguably both his most simple story (get those men off the beach) and his most show-don't-tell style of storytelling. There's a lot to admire with a director stepping outside of his comfort zone like that. It made for a more enjoyable experience, things made a lot more sense for the audience, and all the while, Nolan still got to employ his signature time manipulations that he loves to do. Both sides (audience and director) are satisfied and some middle ground is reached.
I talk a lot about Dunkirk because in comparison, Tenet makes no attempt to reach such middle ground with its audience. It is a film that could care less whether you understand its concepts, or if you are able to keep up with its relentless plot... or if you're able to HEAR a damn thing that anyone is saying.
I give Nolan a lot of credit for being bold here. Few directors manage to convince a studio to give them over $200 million to make an original concept film. And this film truly is something original, with the action that unfolds on screen being like nothing you've ever seen before.
However, what makes action memorable is that it MEANS something, and that it's centered around characters we care about. There has to be something emotionally accessible intertwined with all the explosions and gunfire. But in Tenet, unfortunately we don't get much of that (with the exception of one emotional moment in the film's final moments, but even that doesn't feel earned to me).
Overall, I strongly urge Nolan to look back to his roots. Make an effort to reach that middle ground with the audience so that they are at least able to understand what they're seeing on screen.. and maybe add some relatable, memorable characters too. Keep making heady films that challenge the audience, but do prioritize an emotional core.",Tenet
4041,fforsel,Time-ception with a ruthless score,10,8 September 2020,"After watching it a second time I now feel like this is a masterpiece. Both in filmmaking, story telling and score. I'd highly recommend seeing it at least twice for you probably won't get it all during your first watch.It's like watching a visual puzzle, searching for clues (like birds flying backwards or waves acting weird) while being surprised by the bold and ruthless score. Not only the music is unapologetic, every bullet shot sounds like it's going straight into concrete. There's something merciless about it all. Combined with the relaxed - sometimes even understated - acting it makes you wonder what it is you're looking at. Like: everything suggests there's something large and important going on. Then why do I feel the main characters do not seem to take it very seriously? It wasn't until my second time watching it that I understood what was going on. At least, that's how I feel now... I'm planning on seeing it again soon, to check my theories (and to enjoy all those magnificent suits again).Main clue in my opinion? 'This whole operation is a temporal pincer'.",Tenet
4042,lasotapaul,Momento on Steroids,8,1 September 2020,"Tenet uses the burmerang effect of time delineation very similar to Nolan's previous film Momento. But time is dependent on the plot, which comes primarily through the free-will of the character's choices. Nolan's cast, especially Robert Pattinson, are outstanding, and the characters are fewer than in Inception, allowing for more development. A fast paced film which combines elements from the Bourne Series, Momento (as previously mentioned), and the video game Call of Duty. An enjoyable viewership. What the film lacks however is a stronger enough reason for why the characters do what they do. In the moment choices seem reasonable, given usually the lack of time to plan, and rather react, but after coming away I felt like movies such as The Dark Knight and Inception gave us the emotional anxiety of what these characters had to loose. Tenet however felt more like a Marvel film, if things didn't work out there's always time travel...or sorry, inversion.",Tenet
4043,danielstamate,Another Masterpiece from Nolan,10,1 December 2020,"This is a truly cinema experience, every scene is taking you into an exciting world and to be honest I beleive this is the whole point of making movies. Of course you need to watch it at least twice to fully understand this interesting world, like the other Masterpieces from Nolan (Inception, Interstellar etc.) but once you get past that first prejudgment of 'boring', 'make no sense' movie ,you can really enjoy this, otherwise you are just wasting your time.First impression is that nothing make sense, everything is upside down but I think that's the whole point, making every scene unpredictable but once you understand what's happening, you realize (after watching it twice maybe) that everything actually make sense and makes you beleive it can be real in our world.Another thing I love about Nolan's movies is how they are created.

Was Nolan high on something when he wrote this garbage?
Good gosh and that horrible sound design of the movie, overpowering bass for action scenes! Why? The film has this monotonous taste to this movie, I seriously didn't expect something like this from Nolan.
I don't know who are these pretentious people rating it an 8/9 or whatever, it doesn't deserve that. Only if it is a Nolan Movie doesn't mean it is going to be good. That is not the case for this movie to be sure.

The movie is well shot with some incredible locations and action sequences. Unfortunately the audio mix was unbearably loud and completely ruins this film.I saw this in IMAX and the audio was so loud the dialogue (even during moments with no background music) was distorted and very difficult to understand. Think Bane's mask distorted. Think explosion level loudness anytime someone is speaking. Even worse, much the important dialogue is spoken while the score is roaring in the background. By the film's climax I barely understood nor cared how we go there. That's partly due to the complex story but also because I had no idea what anyone said for 80% of the film.According the the theatre staff the audio levels for the IMAX version are set by the film and must be strictly adhered to. They mentioned that they had been told not to adjust the audio levels for this film except on case-by-case basis, and that the loudness/distortion was actually an intended effect by the film. The fact that staff already had a memo circulating on this issue tells me I'm not the only one who felt this way.Turn it down Nolan, I shouldn't need to bring earplugs to your film.",Tenet

4060,jamesdarcy-95512,storytelling & cinematography masterpiece,10,24 August 2020,"This film will have to be watched multiple times to be completely appreciated. I am a fan of Nolan, but I made an effort to view this film as itself alone, with no comparisons or bias judgment (or as little as possible). Even now I'm not satisfied with one viewing, as there is just so much sewn into the story/physics and timelines of this film. Though I can confidently say from the beginning to end, this film was the complete polar opposite of disappointing. Reviews say the story is hard to follow, I can somewhat support this by saying that there are many deliberate and abrupt cuts between scenes that people may find offsetting, but this is by design as I strongly believe the pace of the movie requires this, additionally the logic behind the concept of inversion would be difficult for most to grasp especially at a fast pace, but you can still appreciate the story without fully understanding the ins and outs of inversion and I think he's done very very well to explain and guide audiences through this. don't expect to completely understand it on the first watch, this isn't a ""mainstream"" Hollywood blockbuster everyone is so accustomed to. This is an intricate, extremely well thought out, fast paced mind melting film that has you walking out the cinema in awe. Nolan fans will thoroughly enjoy every minute of this. It is so thrilling to see how inversion plays out in each scene, pretty astonishing and overwhelming, especially with the music - which might I say is extremely integral to this movies intensity. Some of the music is unlike anything you've heard before, innovative and captivating. The cinematography is visceral and the environments are amazing. Movie keeps you on your toes the whole way, only you have to be conscious about keeping up with some of the dialogue, some of it is spoken pretty fast. You've got a rollercoaster to look forward to if you're considering watching this.",Tenet

4069,tuomasvilhelmtoivonen,Inconsistent piece of garbage,3,26 August 2020,"Christopher Nolan arguably being one of the hottest box office magnet directors at the moment, it was clear that I and my wife couldn't wait for anything less than a 150 minutes long masterpiece. However, it turned out to be an experience that left both of us puzzled. What have these 5 stars reviews been all about?Right at the outset, it was embarrassing that the beginning scene of the film was virtually indistinguishable from all those laughable cliché-packed superhero movie bikini fitness trailers we had to put up with 10-15 minutes before the actual film started. Hey, is this the movie we came to watch so eagerly? Why do we have this strange feeling?To begin with, the main characters of the film must be deemed the absolutely most striking weakness of the film that were so undeveloped and shallow that the whole story of Tenet, if there's such a thing, lacked any suspense and dynamic, which is pretty odd considering we're talking about an action movie here. And whatever they chose to do during those so long tedious 150 minutes couldn't make any sense to anyone who's got some firsthand experience of a marriage, working life or personal responsibility. All the characters seemed to be so completely detached from the true life that their concerns about WW3 or dystopia, whatever you want to call it, made me wonder why I should care about anything these guys are talking about.The utterly uninteresting dialogue seemed to be brimmed with nonsensical theorizing and irrelevant jargon just for sale of itself. Even if some of that theorization actually could make any sense, the director still hadn't bothered to make the picture do the talking to a way greater extent. At worst, some of these dialogues stretched into many minutes long marathon discussions without any point or purpose.Likewise, the endless action scenes of the film can be deemed only unmotivated considering the there *might* have been a real attempt to take a genuine cerebral approach at things. However, the approach failed too simply due to too many striking inconsistencies and loopholes in the plot.Some splendid cinematography and nice score saved this piece of garbage a little bit at least.",Tenet

A visual delight, and an excellent cast. Two or three good surprises during the last third...",Tenet
4072,GSReichardt,Nolan needs to analyze how people talk in real life,5,26 August 2020,"For the most part, I usually enjoy Nolan's films even though they have always struck me as a bit ""cold"" and distanced - you know, visually impressive but the characters and the stories often lack a bit of soul (so to speak). Well ... Tenet is definitely the worst offender by far.I didn't care for the characters, since the film spends no time fleshing them out. I think the actors did what they could but they definitely didn't have a lot to work with - I liked Pattinson, though. Honestly, his character would probably have made for a more interesting and better protagonist than the Protagonist (lol) but oh well ...
Their motivations are almost non-existing or so ridiculously thin that you just don't care - again, we don't really know these characters at all, so why should we care about their motivations, especially when we are only being informed of them instead of shown?This leads to another huge problem I had with the film: so much clumsy exposition! Even totally irrelevant things get heavy exposition. The dialogue could easily be something like: ""Have you heard about a great war in the 1910's?"" ""Ah yes, World War I. began with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 which resulted in said war that lasted 4 years, and eventually led to the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 ."" ""Very good. As you know *thing we'll never mention again*"".
No one talks like that, Christopher Nolan!Generally, the dialogue is awful yet (unintentionally) hilarious at times.
It's funny that a director who clearly wants to appear very, very clever is incapable of writing subtle dialogue ...All in all, yeah, it's visually appealing and all that but at the end of the day, I'd much rather watch a low budget film with great characters and a strong plot, than spend 2,5 hours watching a long action sequence disguised as some sort of story.Additional SPOILERS (sorta):I can't get over how egoistical and badly written Debicki's character is. Her only motivation is her son. Even when she is told, that they can prevent the world's end she's like ""but what about my son?!?!"" - my friends and I literally laughed out loud when she said that. The entire world < Debicki's son (he's not even at stake or anything, she doesn't have to sacrifice him. It doesn't make any sense at all)Also the villain's ""If I can't have you, no one else can!"" was just ... Bad. Again; show, don't tell. Come on!",Tenet
4073,jmholden-40841,Another Quality Film From Nolan,7,26 August 2020,"Yet again Christopher Nolan delivers as only he could with a really perplexing, mind-bending tale. Plenty was made of this film in the run-up to it's release and it should top the box office for the foreseeable future with a distinct lack of quality cinematic releases in the near future.One massive criticism of the film......It would be nice to actually here the dialogue. Too often i found myself in my seat trying to read the lips of the cast as the background music completely drowned out what was probably very important dialogue. Fortunately the dramatic action sequences really helped with the pace and movement of this story and made up for this really bizarre sound decision.All in all another really good addition to the Nolan library and come awards season i'm sure this Title will be topping plenty of categories.",Tenet

But you do get the just to what is going on... I'd probably recommend a second watch.All in all, Chris Nolan did a fantastic job with the film!

When the movie isn't entertaining itself with ludicrous dialogue ('if the world ends...that means my son would die'...) it's bamboozling the audience with ridiculous explanations of its own self-important 'physics' ('entropy', 'algorithms', 'inverted everything').Most of the critical dialogue to explain the movie is explained only once; and meanwhile there is often a car crash/explosion going off in the background, a dystopian ear-splitting soundtrack, or a Russian voice being played backwards which makes it hard to even understand what's being said. The only part of the movie I clearly understood was the part where they explained the tax efficient benefits of a Freeport for transiting artwork across borders. They explained that like 3 times. I wish they could have explained why an 'algorithm' can change 'entropy' as many times.I'm normally a fan of Nolan movies, but he lost me when he introduced the 'temporal pincer movement'. Many will watch this movie 3 times and understand everything and I'm happy for them. For the casual viewer, it's fun to see some explosions but the plot is largely incomprehensible.",Tenet

That excitement quickly turned to confusion and frustration.The movie started out fairly easy to follow and then it just goes completely out into left field about half way though. Christopher Nolan has NOT done it again like some have suggested.John David Washington's character is so boring, bland, and he gives you no reason to like or even root for his character. I couldn't have cared less if he lived or died at the end. Robert Pattinson was probably the best thing about this movie.The plot is so hard to understand. It literally makes zero sense and what you do understand, you really don't. The movie has so many editing errors from actors mouths not moving when you hear their voice, to characters jumping time from scene to scene which aren't part of the inversion scenes. Just lazy editing. Oh, and often you can't understand what is actually being said because the voices are so muffled and the music takes over.This is definitely not a movie that needs to be seen in the theatre. I would watch it again but only when it is available for free and I have the option to pause it and really understand what is going on. My brain hurts even trying to comprehend this mess.",Tenet

4084,steelpotato,Nolan has lost his sense of urgency,4,28 August 2020,"Let's go through the good things first. Nolan creates another oneiric dream-like filmscape that visualizes imagination like no other, and Washington and Pattinson both deliver the material they are working with stoicly. The action set pieces are at times superb and the soundtrack is out of this world.But we need to talk about the sound mix, drowning out dialogue at the best of times and coming across as muddied with the continued reliance on characters using masks that alter their voice ala Bane. This wouldn't be a big issue if the film wasn't incredibly heavy with exposition, to the point that missing a line or two here or there can create significant plot holes. Honestly the film jumps from overly simple to obtuse, often within the same breath.It wants to one-up Timecop and Primer, but kind of fails to meet the excitement of the van Damme vehicle, by taking itself so seriously it hurts (Kenneth Branagh is wasted as a caricature) and is nowhere near as smart as it thinks it is when compared to Carruth's best practice of smart time travel.Half an hour too long, but I appreciate getting to see this on the big screen in 2020.",Tenet

Sound effects is good on IMAX. Visual effects also good. Story bores me and it was presented on a boring manner. It can be better prolly if let say another director presents it. I love Nolan's work but this one feels like lacking. But Nolan did one good masterly move I guess. Timely released on cinemas because if there is no pandemic it'll be a big disaster I guess.

It is an amazing film and like many others of Nolan's creation, is highly rewarding as the audience gets the pleasure of piecing together all of the clues presented to them - both those hidden and those in plain sight.

The viewer keeps getting rewarded for his attention throughout the entire movie.The whole cast delivers great performances (which was for me as a classic Twilight-hater especially impressive in Robert Pattinson's case).Just watch it.

4094,zgjimkonjuhi,Reached too far...,2,28 August 2020,"Ladies and gentlemen,(Spoiler alert. If you want to skip spoilers then don't read the bullet points part)I am simply shocked! I mean, I get why many private corporation platforms would rate this film highly (because they probably get paid to do so) but i really don't understand how SO many people and independent critics are giving this movie such a high rating. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever watched at this calibre of a movie.Now to set the premise, i have never posted my thoughts or ratings about a movie, ever. But this movie triggered such a disappointment in me, that now its transcended to anger for wasting my time and never getting those two and a half hours of my life back. Hence, I am compelled to share the truth and try to de-wheel the bandwagon of pro-Tenet group-think that exists simply because of what we like from Nolans previous work. The worst part is that this will continue to waste my time because of all the mixed reviews that will encumber social content online and more unfortunately, in real life for weeks to come.
Now, before i sound just like another cynical critic bashing a movie for attention, i will share a couple of good points. The cinematography, actions and music were great when rated individually.Notice that I started a new paragraph because out of respect to some of Nolands previous work, that last statement lingering for the half-breath in your mind before you started this paragraph is all the time of day I wish to spend praising this movie. Even still, those positives don't carry much weight these days when you have a big budget like this movie obviously did.The movie started strong with powerful action and a with a storyline that was unique and thought-provoking as to be expected by Nolan. Although this initially captured my interest and attention, it was unfortunately unable to hold it. Nolan could not effectively explain the pseudo science and concepts well, spending a majority of the movie trying and failing to do so. In addition to this, i feel that the overbearingly loud, suspenseful music had overspilled to most of the movie to induce the feeling of being on the edge of your chair with tension, anxiety and anticipation probably to compensate on both the lack in plot and character development.Next, the actors. Almost all the reviews i have seen about this point hypes and applaud them for their performance. In reality, they all fell short and in particular, John Denzel. (No pun intended)
As the protagonist, the director reached for a character that was supposed to be a cross between Bourne-cold and Bond-smooth which I felt Denzel could not deliver on and I also felt absolutely no connection to him or any of his motives throughout the whole movie. Although this was primarily due to weak character development on the directors part, his acting totally flatlined, being unemotional and unenthusiastic. There was also a blind-siding scene at the end where he surprisingly squeezed out tears probably to recoup but by that point was just out of character and non-sensical.Next, Kenneth Branagh who was shooting for a rich, ruthless and sinister Russian villian. Although he acted his script as well as anyone could have done, it ruined his character for me through a couple of underwhelming scenes which I personally thought were quite comical, albeit unintentionally so. In particular, at the light dinner party scene, where his very eerie and calm character ended up giving the protagonist a very heavy and inventively murderous death threat that was so easily defused by what could be described as a four word pick-up line. In addition, it worked so well, it had the protagonist not only set free but invited to a hydrofoil sailing session the next day to explain himself on. All I could think was, but why? With a deep frown and light-bulb screw hand twist gesture.Additionally, another scene that was supposed to add to his villainous character development was where he was about to belt-beat his wife, creatively threading his shirts cufflinks in the last holes of the belt as if to showcase that he is a tier of sophistication above the average wife-beater. A few words uttered by his wife lead to an anti-climatic scene. Again, very heavy on the threat but so easily diffused. In a nut shell, I just thought this guy is all fart and no poo.Moving on, Debicki was probably the only character you could feel any sympathy for Her and Pattinson arguably did the best job in terms of acting their scripts out but even then, there was too much going on in the movie to fully appreciate their underdeveloped character, (Pattinsons more-so than Debickis.)In addition to the music, plot, script and actors, there were also inconsistencies and rookie director moves in the film which always grind my gears when you notice them like:***SPOILER ALERT START****
Why do scenes transition so quickly and dive straight into the heavy dialogue even when traveling across countries. Clear horizon swoops and labelling of the cities would definitely help.Sailing scene: how did all characters seemingly from different walks of life just know how to hydrofoil sail at really high speeds nonetheless from one scene to the next which is clearly a very technical and endeavour? Also why were they having such a serious discussion in such an unfitting and loud environmentWhy werent they breathing oxygen in some of the inverted scenes?Why was the protagonist shooting himself when he knew it was himself?How can only one man push, not one, but several pallets full of gold bars weighing tonnes of kilograms in just seconds so easily?Why were people getting knocked out so pathetically and instantly in so many action and fight scenes across the movie. E.g the theatre scene at the beginning, everyone in the audience passed out instantly only seconds from what looked like helium released from gas tanks for ballons into the vents whereas the terrorists took ages to get their masks on but didnt pass out.there was a flimsy chokehold somewhere in India that knocked out one of the guards very quickly tooThe impregnable vault scene having so many thick walls, levels and secured doors and systems to protect its clients assets which by the end had only a flimsy shutter that was keeping it from the outside open carpark and airport where the airbus was in flames outside.***SPOILER ALERT FINISH****All in all, Nolan seems to have reached too far on this one, relying more on action and concept rather than clarity and characters. Even though it was 2.5 hours, there was unnecessarily too much action rushed and squeezed in and not enough invested for both character and plot development. This left me feeling lost in what the characters were exactly doing, why and how they were doing it. Moreover, I just didn't care either because i didn't feel emotionally invested and even considered leaving the theatre a couple of times. i am pretty good at ""getting it"" with complex movies but is is surely one of those movies that you need to watch again to catch things you missed the first time. However, I dont think i can stomach the torture to sit through it again and quite frankly, i dont think Nolan deserves it. My best shot is to read reviews online when i eventually feel up to it. Until then, im going to have to stick with venting my thoughts and grounding the guys on the thumbs-up parade.

Loud, deep and painfully drawn out tones over all dialogue made it confusing to follow also.Kenneth Branagh was quite good but the real standout was Robert Pattinson as a likeable sidekick/partner who always leads on to know more than he should with a good character arc.Overall the forward and ""inverse"" time concept was amazing with stunning visuals and with more focus on dialogue this movie could be an 8+ but I was struggling to keep up and my partner was utterly lost.",Tenet

But after getting to know how the film was made, I started to look at it diffently. What struck me the most was that very small parts, like the helicopter landing on the Sator's yacht, was really hard to pull of because of the size of the chopper. For any viewer that part goes over your head, you don't think about it at all.
Even though most people know that the plane crash- and Tallin freeway scene is done for real, you have to think about it for a while to realize how much prep-work it requires.
Looking at the movie from this perspective really opened my eyes about the film. At first I was disappointed, I thought Nolan had more to bring to the table. But after watching the behind the scenes that comes with the dvd purchase, I realized he brought his A-game once again.",Tenet

I really wanted to like this movie and I usually try to never be too critical of a movie, but there was no part to which I could cling on and say there was something positive and great about it.Even if this movie is deeper and has complex themes which are interesting, your brain shouldn't be overloaded by attempting to comprehend every single second of the movie. It is way too heavy and everything moves way too fast for an effective analysis.The sound and music were waayy to loud to the point that my ears hurt. I literally didn't understand half of what the characters were saying which only worsened the confusion. Subtitles would have been necessary.There is very little backstory to any of the characters, and I didn't care for any of them due to a lack of great acting/ character development. What made Nolan's previous films so great is that it explores the complexity of the characters and their motivations. Here, you're just thrown in the action from the very first second with almost no explanation of each and everyone's purpose in the story.You should at least understand the majority of the concepts after you finish a movie. Here, you'll probably need to re-watch at least another time to start understanding the plot a little bit more. However, I'm not planning to waste another 2.5 hours of my life on this movie.Here's my reccomendation: don't waste your time and money on this film, you'll save hours of life.",Tenet

Besides some well-done elements (action scenes, original idea about our perception of time), the rest left me cold. The actors do not appear to be involved in their role (except Kenneth Branagh in the role of the Machiavellian husband). The music is a jumble of boring electronic sounds, without following the atmosphere of several scenes. It is even ridiculous at times. Several characters appear and never reappear. Why did they appear anyway? Several scenes are completely unnecessary and should have been cut during the editing to make a film shorter, but much more interesting. The natural sites (like the city of Oslo in which the villa of one of the characters is located) are very poorly exploited visually when they could have made the visual experience breathtaking. The main special effect used is also quite poorly exploited because, besides certain scenes, while the viewer should be amazed, it often looks as if nothing extraordinary is happening. My rating: 2.5 / 5 (just the passing mark).",Tenet

4115,charlottetyj,"First time, feel it. Second time onwards, understand it.",10,17 September 2020,"Let me preface this by saying that I created an IMDB account just to rate this, because I was just that blown away. Let me also say that I am a huge Nolan fan. At first watch, I was thrilled and blown away by how relentless the pacing and how epic music was (props to Ludwig Goransson, seriously an iconic score). Despite not being able to grasp the barrage of elements and concepts the movie threw our way and the fact that my theatre muddled the sound mixing, I left the theatre in awe of how the movie made me FEEL. The only movie that I feel comes close to being able to draw me in so magnetically for its whole length was 1917.Now upon my second watch in an IMAX with far better sound where I could actually hear dialogue and countless reddit dives, so much of the movie makes sense and flows so much better. I noticed countless little things I did not before that made the movie far more poignant and elevated, and even TENET's concept as a whole felt far easier to understand. From what I hear from my friends, TENET is definitely not a movie for everyone in that it requires the audience's full attention to detail, investment and intellect. This is definitely not your average popcorn movie where everything is spoonfed, and in fact nothing Nolan does is average. This film REQUIRES second viewing and even more to truly appreciate how single detail comes together, and anyone who takes this film at first glance only will sorely miss the nuance and levels it takes on.If you're seeing the movie for the first time and feel overwhelmed but are invested to know more, feel free to dive into Tenet's reddit thread which has given me countless details and theories I missed that made my second viewing so much richer and more informed. TENET is truly a film that only gets better and unveils hidden treasures with each viewing, and I am definitely looking forward to seeing the film again and again in the coming months.",Tenet
4116,easyleezy,"Incomprehensible, irritating",2,30 August 2020,"Generally a Christopher Nolan fan but couldn't wait for this film to end. Anyone giving this a good rating is pretending to have understood/enjoyed it to appear intelligent. I've seen one person give it 10/10, who wrote that they left the cinema confused and disappointed. Work that out. Why can't people be honest?The storyline is so confusing, with the idea that you'll understand it all in the end. Which means that you'll be sat frustrated for 2.5hrs waiting for everything to click. By the time it ""sort of"" does (and it doesn't really), you'll be way past the point of caring. The drama of the action sequences are lost because you've no idea what's happening or why.And as if it's not hard enough to follow already, the little crumbs of explanation that you are given every so often and garbled by the actors and drowned out by the film score, so any hope you had of understanding anything is gone.Because it's a time travel movie, there are a lot of scenes repeated, sort of in reverse order but not, and the back-and-forth re-runs are just frankly irritating.The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the visuals and sound are impressive (garbled acting aside).AVOID.

First thing first, the audio mix is COMPLETE garbage, it made me questioned whether I had lost the ability to understand the english language with all this mumbling. Second, the scenes and dialogues are overly played and long. Third having all these reverse effects is visually unattractive and feel very unnatural (like watching a reverse tiktok video of people jumping in a pool and replay that video over a five minutes period). To top it off, probably the fault of the cinema, I realised 10 sec into the movie that the sound was way too loud and had to leave 15 mins before the end of the movie given the constant explosions.
Some individuals seem to indicate that they completely figured the movie out the second time around. Personally, I think that, had the movie been done properly, everyone would have gotten it after seeing it once.. Think the matrix or inception for example",Tenet

4121,jficus,Shallow echo of Nolan's better movies,4,31 August 2020,"So, TENET is finally here and certainly entertaining. If it helps the big screen, the theaters and all the people working there, I am fine with having spent 10 EUR for my ticket.Alas, it is by far not a good Nolan film. As many reviews have already pointed out, there are a lot of problems with the characters, the plot and the central idea of inversion/time travel. You just have to look at the many Nolan masterpieces to realize that by his own standards, TENET is sub par in every aspect:Almost all of the action scenes are weak variations of what we have seen before. Take the chase sequence for example, it is less kinetic than any chase sequence from the Batman Trilogy. Compared to the highway chase from Matrix Reloaded, it is plane dull, unengaging and far away from mind-bending. The opera scene also seems weak and non-sensical compared to the many Batman raid scenes (Wall Street, Football Stadium). The cargo plane scene could be compared to the opening scene of TDK, but bigger is not better because it lacks the surprise and the tension of the latter and is ruined by the unnecessary assumption that anyone would fly around tons of pure gold and/or would need extra destraction when crashing a plane into a hangar.The rest of the action is somehow ridiculed by people running and ships moving backwards. In Inception, the dream sequences were unreal, but well explained and meaningful, so that you were left in awe by people floating around or skiing into a mountain fortress. In TENET all this seems cringeworthily comedic and somehow not involving at all. Only the one on one fight scene a the Freeport is interesting to watch, but it is - other than Inception's fight scenes - hard to follow. I can't tell if it makes sense in the context of inversion.The actors are really okay but given nothing they could really work with. There is no motivation and no connection between them. Kenneth Branagh is - except for one overdone scene - a good villain and his actions and behaviour are threatening, but you simply don't buy why he does all this. He is not a complicated, mysterious or menacing character at all, just ""the bad guy"". Joker would have had him for lunch. The cast lacks someone like Cilian Murphy who can unnerve you just with his presence if he is given a role that is not just one-dimensional.Many plot elements seem forced, unneccesary and illogical. Why would Kat be compromised by a false assessment of a fake Goya drawing? How would that make her hostage of her husband? No family court in the world would take that as a reason for taking her beloved son away. And why must her husband keep it in a Freeport facility? For tax reasons? Being the ruthless criminal that he is? That is just thoughtless writing.There are also a couple of scenes which play as a homage to bond films. Some of them are even genuine but it tells a lot when a fist fight involving a cheese grater sticks to your mind as one of the most involving scenes of the whole movie (and I am not quite sure if that scene is not heavily inspired by ""American Ultra"").All in all, TENET fails to involve and grip the audience, even on a big screen and in 4K resolution. You simply do not believe and you do not care about what you see. Cinematography and direction are superb, but we've seen that before in nearly every other Nolan flick. In the end, TENET looks like Amazon or Netflix trying to copy Nolan by spending tons of money, but lacking the heart and soul of his other films. You can't evade the impression it could have been a lot better had it been done more carefully, but was rushed to the end because of the pandemic.",Tenet

Even with Dolby Audio, dialogue was muffled.I'm a genuine fan of Mr Nolan's work I loved what he did with Inception and the Dark Knight films. The story was garbage, convoluted and utterly confusing. It simply didn't flow and was a very hard watch.My mantra that I use on any thing that I watch, is that if the actors have to explain the story line, then the film doesn't work, think of The Da Vinci Code as an example.Avoid like the plague in the cinema, if you are genuinely intrigued buy the hype, wait for home realise and then you can at least rewind to go try to get a bit clarity on the storyline.",Tenet

It was also sci-fi/action which I also really enjoy. Nolan is one of my favourite directors.Oh dear, the first problem was the dreadful sound quality. Trying to make out what everyone was saying over the loud soundtrack made me feel really stressed as I'm sure key plot information was lost. I put this down to an error at the cinema as it was their first day open after lockdown; but it seems I'm not the only one who craved an ear trumpet.The plot was so convoluted and confusing I found it exhausting. When my son turned to me & whispered 'have you got any idea what's going on?' I felt vindicated. I didn't particularly warm to any of the characters & couldn't work out why any of them were part of the story.I came away with that feeling of a half remembered dream, bits were intriguing or exciting But I couldn't quite piece it altogether.

Here is a director that does not compromise his ideas and expresses love for the cinematic experience with every frame.Tenet gives you no time for consideration in the first half, by taking all your attention to the mysterious premise of an unknown foe. In this time even the dullest scenes of remote meetings get interesting and are carried by John David Washington. Compared to Inception (2010), where every part of the strategy was explained to the audience, here there is ample room for interpretation and the tempo is building up to a point where there is no time to try.In the second half, my personal revelation was the transformation of Elizabeth Debicki's Character from a Woman in Distress in need of saving to a determined uncompromising heroine. This highlighted a change in the movie as a whole and increased my respect for Debicki's acting.Even though I was not surprised by every twist towards the end, I was entertained and in awe of the overall experience. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the theories that were introduced and was pleasantly surprised of the execution.I would recommend this movie to everyone who is willing to experience it first, before trying to understand it.",Tenet

The movie really has to be experienced and my is it one, but go in with an empty mind and open heart and you won't be disappointed, though the dialogue and music mix sometimes make it's hard to discern dialogue but my hearing sucks and the strong world and character building allow you to fill in small blanks and do not detract from the experience.

4140,aam-73988,Tenet.. Here is a very net review for you,7,1 September 2020,"I don't like to rate films but I had to..This review is for Nolan's fans who couldn't put their fingers on what wen wrong with TENET:The beginning is good.. It reminds you of the dark knight.. The opening scene is similar to when the clowns were about to rub the bank in The Dark Knight..I said it before just from watching the trailer.. Now I am saying it after watching the movie.. Nolan made a huge mistake by choosing J.D Washington as the protagonist.. He is just not cut out for it.. His acting is a little bit.. I think the word that comes to mind is shallow!!
He is very monotonous and You can see that his ego interferes with his performance.. And as I always say.. You can never be a great actor if your ego is in the way.. J.D's arrogance is obvious I am afraidIn some scenes the music does not go well.. It feels like an overlap.. Like it doesn't make sense at all..Some dialogues in the script also lack depth and a sense of cohesion.. I say to Nolan it is a Great story but a good script.. sometimes not that good!!
I don't know how Nolan did not notice this while fimling.. J.D Washington is almost reading the lines every time he is in a conversation with another person.. It is like he is not in the zone.. He is not completely the protagonist.. Many times it feels as if he is reading those lines directly from the script.. This is due to lack of emotion and body.. And also lack of natural charisma.. Because you can tell from his presence in the scenes that he is trying to be charismatic.. It doesn't feel natural .. And this is one of the main reasons why the movie feels boring until half of it.. Then it gets a little bit exciting with the action and inversion scenes..As you keep watching you get the feeling that J.D.W is not quite understanding the role, and this resulted in even confusing his partners in all his scenes.. They are performing according to his performance.. Because as it is said: Acting is reacting! Man most of the scenes I can literally see J.D is preparing his next line to say while looking at his partners in the scenes to finish their sentences.. Unfortunately it's that bad..Another thing is the time of dialogues between characters.. They are hurried.. Most of them feel interrupted almost like conversations that never made it through.. In a movie about time.. Conversations had no time HahaTo be honest.. I began to lose focus and interest in the movie after the first 25 minutesIn J.D.W and Robert Pattinson's conversations and scenes suddenly I began to wish as if Robert was the one playing the protagonist.. Yes He was that good in this movie.. But maybe because He had Batman.. And I think in all the scenes.. Robert kind of forced J.D to perform better.. Great guy Robert really a great guy!Elizabeth Debicki also did a good performance.. She also pushed J.D to perform better in her scenes with him.. I remember her from the Great Gatsby.. This role as Kat is better I think.. She developed depth and realness in her acting.. She is calmer and steadier.. And very charismatic and attractive!!The truth of Tenet is.. All the principle characters preformed better than the protagonist.. So is this mean that maybe Christopher Nolan didn't actually find the right actor for the job and he had to go with J.D ? Maybe! Or Maybe not! Or He just missed this time...So the idea which this movie is based upon is the entertainment of the show.. Which is basically inversion.. A world where everything you knew about reality runs backwards from past to future and from future to past and in the now is where the operation of the protagonist is happening.. It is new.. It is exciting.. But it is not flawless eitherAll in all it is a good movie.. It may take Nolan a while to realize that he didn't made the right choice when choosing the leading actor of his film..In fact this movie would have been better than Inception.. way better.. Only if it wasn't J.D.WAnd only one name comes to mind when I think about the best actor for the protagonist .. And it is Jake Gyllenhaal...Am",Tenet
4141,botterholley-01785,Hopefully better the second time,6,1 September 2020,"My Tenet review
Cons: 1-the score was REALLY loud at times which is normal for a Christopher Nolan movie but still.
2-The dialogue was hard to hear. Often times the characters were wearing oxygen masks so imagine everyone speaking a little more clearer than Bane in Dark Knight Rises. Plus the loud score, I thought it was hard to hear the characters which made an already confusing movie harder to follow.
3- Confusing! It's like Inception on speed.
Pros:
1- Special effects were pretty cool, several times I would just wonder how did they film that! Something's going back in time while others in reverse is just cool to watch.
2- Original idea, I want to watch it again because I think I'll like it more the more times I watch it. It's pretty convoluted but I like the idea of the movie. That is if I can hear the characters enough to follow the movie better the 2nd time
Ultimately it's worth the watch",Tenet
4142,neilebasford,Absolute non-sense,1,2 September 2020,"The movie started with a very intense ""Batman"" like opening. This movie showed promise the first twenty minutes and even though nothing made sense, there was still hope that it would all be tied together and all make sense. Unfortunately, hope was lost quickly and the plot disappeared into a endless past-future alternate reality abyss and never came back. This movie lacked depth and seemed pretentious from Nolan. A truly intellectual ""flex"" that surely he had no idea what was going on either. If there was one good thing from Covid is- very few people have had to sit through this disaster of a movie.",Tenet

No smart evil plan to conquer the past, or make use of time travel features to stop climate change. No, Just a simple sick evil russian who will die anyway and wants to take everyone with him. The rest around the plot is his boring wife with her kid, we never actually see or care about. New people Just appear, dropping huge heists with Zero preperation. I know they did it already in a Loop multiple Times Blabla, but as a watcher its not convincing in that moment, not immersive, even confusing and clearing that up in the last 10 Minutes of the movie, doesnt make up for 2 hours of boredom.science not plausibleweak charactersstupid russian villain - American Hero, made up Story""mind bending"" stuff aside - just not goodtoo long (fighting scenes are used all twice..... because of the beautiful loop)sound horribletoo much pengpeng and no good dialogueLast 10 Minutes of the movie Twist ""Here the real Message of the movie"" - Like, now its a masterpiece because tada, timetravellogic all ....come onIm gonna watch it again!

Coming to cast Robert Pattinson and John David washington given their best and Ludwig Göransson replaced space of hans Zimmer very well,

Movie had a great idea/concept of time inversion that had potential, but was poorly executed. Started very well, however how movie went it got uninteresting.Plot was kinda basic. Another movie how Americans are saving the world against ""bad"" Russian oligarch who is actually not that bad, as he is in some sort of way saving the world as well, but from different perspective, presented in bad light.Nolan inserted some level of humor in to dialogue. i got impression that specific lines didn't match the characters and situations, running scenes.It was to laud most of the time, sound effects covering character voices and making it sometimes hard to keep up with dialog.If we take away complex/confusing part, time inversion that keep audience attention, it would be another B grade action movie about saving humanity.

It was hard for me too. So basically the viewer has to watch the movie twice, watch 'Tenet explained' videos on youtube, read 'Tenet explained' articles on reddit and then watch the movie one more time.

Incredible cinematography and score. This movie was a visceral experience, a must see in theaters for the full experience.The plot was almost perfect, it lost me in the 2nd act but the final act really pulled it together and left me amazed with the writing and wanting more.Robert Pattinson was great, looking forward to The Batman after seeing this.If you like Nolan's adventurous and fantastical stories like Inception, Interstellar, and The Prestige then you will definitely like this movie.Cons:
John David Washington wasn't convincing in a lot of the ""espionage CIA agent"" suave scenes. He delivered a lot of lines in a meek way without much charisma, however he was fantastic in the action sequences. I'm excited to see him grow as an actor though he has a lot of potential.The score drowned out the dialogue a lot of the times, and other times the accents made it difficult to find out how the plot was developing. This movie is such an intense visual experience that the dialogue needed to be clearer to help guide the viewers at confusing points in the plots development. Looking forward to rewatching with subtitles.-The ""Bad Guy"" Russian actor also wasn't very convincing either. He didn't hurt the movie but he didn't really help it either.",Tenet

I just finished seeing the film for a third time, and it gets increasingly better with each viewing. I think the cast all give great performances, I really like the wit and charisma of John David Washington as ""The Protagonist"", and the charm of Robert Pattinson. But the big role for me here, was with Elizabeth Debeki as Kat. She's gives the best performance of the film in my opinion, containing the most emotion. Story wise, this comes across as a simple save the world type film, but it hefts far more interesting with the inclusion of inversion. This is by far Nolan's most conceptually confusing film to date. As to be expected however, multiple rewatches helped improve this. Visually the movie looks great. Various locations and shots containing inversed aspects was a joy to watch. Especially when integrated into the action. This is by far Nolan's best film for fight sequences. Choreography has improved a ton here. Overall, a great film for spectacle, action and enjoyment. It does lack a lot of the heart present in Inception and especially in Interstellar. But as an experience, rated on enjoyment and pure quality. This is a near masterpiece in my opinion.",Tenet

4165,granthastin,Designed to be Confusing,6,4 September 2020,"Want to start by saying that I am a big Christopher Nolan fan. I went into this movie expecting to be slightly mind f'd just like I was after Inception and Interstellar. My favorite part about those movies was the discussions and debates I could have with my friends afterward, discussing and working through what we just watched. However, after watching Tenet, we all just sat there asking ourselves ""what did we just watch"" and ""what just happened?"".This movie felt like an attempt by Nolan to one-up some of his masterpieces by seeing just how confused he could make an entire audience. It wasn't necessarily that the plot was so complex beyond understanding, it was the fact that there were very important scenes in which you couldn't understand what the characters were saying at all. Scenes on the boats and in cars, discussions over the phone, discussions with oxygen masks on, discussions with loud music and exterior noise in general, etc.From a sheer entertainment standpoint, the movie doesn't disappoint. It just seemed like we got to the ""wow"" moment at the end without understanding how we really got there. The shock value at the end was overshadowed by the convoluted and muddled story and dialogue that led to it.I will watch this movie again, but with the volume lower and subtitles on.",Tenet
4166,joseashleygrace,"Once you understand it, you'll realize how brilliant this movie is.",10,4 September 2020,"If you know anything about Christopher Nolan's movies, then you'll know that 1) you'll have to watch this movie more than once to understand it & 2) you need to do research if you aren't exceedingly knowledgeable at the sciences. - I'm not so I did a lot of research to understand what was going on.
This movie is all about time travel & unlike most time travel movies, Tenet's time travel concept is that everything is predestined so everything you do, have done, and will do have been accounted for. So whatever you do in the past will not change your future. Once you understand that concept the movie will make more sense to you.
There are two ways you can get back in time: regular vs inverted. So for regular you can go back in time however, you can't go back to the time you left. You're going to have to wait the amount of time you traveled back to. (Ie if you go back 2 days, then you'll have to wait 2 days to move forward with your life). And when you go back inverted, everything is backwards & with this version you can go back to the moment you left.
This movie is one of his bests and really gets your gears going. I would recommend watching it twice. Tenet is a genius film.",Tenet

The music keeps you interested in the movie at all times. It is impossible to be bored, especially with all of the incredible action. And if you know anything about the movie it is all about palindromes and the music is a palindrome. Isn't that crazy!!! The music is the same backwards and forwards it's all connected!!! Now, the music is a bit loud so I would advice closed captioning to be safe.My second favorite part is all the Easter eggs. The story is incredible! But the foreshadowing dotted around the movie and the Easter eggs that when you see them make everything thing so connected.And finally, the cinematography is excellent!

But everyone seems to have missed this plot hole that's big enough to drive a 10 ton truck, a fire truck, a BMW that's faster that it looks, and... Well, you get the idea. It's a doozy.I won't even bother with the minor 'nitpicks' (as my OH calls them) like if The Protagonist is fighting himself, why is he shooting at his head...?Look, Kat's entire story is crazy. She is a poor little rich girl, who we're supposed to feel sorry for because her billionaire husband is controlling. Not that shocking, not that sympathetic. Not much of a secret, either, if 'the help' know all about it and serve her paintings for breakfast. Not just her hubby that could blackmail her or get her sent to prison.She has a pathological obsession with her son, to the point where she apparently doesn't even see him as part of the whole universe, having to clarify that if it's destroyed, that will include him.Then, she's shot, and the movie doesn't even abide by it's own rules. The future is pushing back at us, but we're winning because there's more moving in our time flow. The Protagonist even gets told about drag being different when he's driving a car. So if everything is pushing against the inverted bullet, it would be LESS serious being shot by one than a 'normal' bullet.Assuming there are other reasons for that, as Kat is recuperating, she reveals that a man obsessed with his heart rate (why?) has cancer. So, she isn't trapped in a gilded cage after all. She just has to make nice with her husband for the sake of her son, who she beats us around the head with how much she loves, and then when hubby dies of cancer, she can take sole custody of the son and spend all the money. What exactly is The Protagonist saving her from now?I am now conflicted. I'd rather that whole mess be cut from the script and save my bum cheeks from some numbness... But on the other hand, if the runtime wasn't so long, I wouldn't have had that extra scoop of ice cream...I had thought that a nice touch was making the antagonist, Sator, nameless like The Protagonist. I had thought the gold bars and killing someone was in order to steal that identity, but apparently it was because they were sent back from the future. Like the ending of Inception, that's one I'll interpret myself.Christopher Nolan the director did an amazing job. Christopher Nolan the screenwriter needs a few rewrites on this one.",Tenet
4174,debolleseppe,Show and tell,10,6 January 2021,"One of the very basics of filmmaking is show and tell. Showing and telling the right amount of information to make the audience constantly thinking. Its how you surprise the audience and how you develop your plots. I have never seen a movie that was so good in show and tell than tenet has done. I watched it on blu-ray since cinemas were closed and it was easier with subtitles, but damn this was good. If you pay attention to what's happening and you follow the dialogue along the way you understand perfectly what's happening. But you never do before you saw the scene. It makes every surprise impossible to guess, and makes the movie as amazing as it is. Everything that happens, happens for a reason and it happens as it should happen. This may be confusing at first but in the end you will understand. The revisiting of the scenes showing you more detail without telling you everything is what makes it so great.

4177,natsmalik,AMAZING HARD SCI FI MOVIE THAT *MOST* UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND,10,6 September 2020,"Nolan has far surpassed himself - no longer in the realm of science fiction with a hard F, moreso in the realm of *science* fiction, with an emphasis on the former. This movie functions as his follow up/spiritual successor to Inception: a mostly action packed film with a core plot ""gimmick."" Unfortunately whereas 50% of Inception is exposition to carry a stumbling audience through what they're seeing, Nolan has largely dispensed with exposition for the core plot gimmick apart from throwaway lines from the scientist that John David Washington's character first meets and Robert Pattinson later on in the movie. What most audience members will absorb is the ""go with the instinct"" part and the simple mechanic of ""things traveling backwards through time.""In reality, Nolan has found a way to realize through a physics based explanation his long yearned for time travel plot. Essentially, the ""time stiles"" that the characters pass through are antimatter conversion devices - transforming all who pass through it into the antimatter ""inverted"" versions of themselves. Antimatter being matter that is identical to regular matter but traveling backwards through time - with reversed entropy. The movie's logic then flows from there - with characters at various points encountering the antimatter versions of themselves (creating a minor plot hole at one moment when JDW's character fights himself going backwards in time without causing any sort of annihilation - which would necessarily occur when matter-antimatter collides).Overall it's a masterful script that combines tightly conceived action setpieces with a fascinating core mechanic and includes various Easter eggs due to the time travel element and reversal of causality that merits several watches to appreciate it in all its complexity. It's also extremely bold and very appreciated for a mainstream director to release a movie that upwards of 70% of audiences will not be able to understand fully. Nolan is making the movies that he enjoys and is mostly concerned with delivering a great experience without really caring to spell out the ABCs of what's happening to the average moviegoer. The cinematography, action, etc are all amazing of course. The score is very memorable and is reminiscent of the heavy 80s synth from Netflix's Bandersnatch, unique from Zimmer's usual scores.I can see where some viewers didn't understand the dialogue - there are a lot of scenes where the characters are wearing masks and two scenes that are almost trolls that include the characters on windsurfers yelling at each other and characters dubbed in a very echo-y manner over backmasking. Additionally, half the cast has accented English and if you're not familiar with accents (Russian, French, Hindi, and Michael Caine) you might not be able to clearly understand what they're saying. On that note, Dimple Kapadia did a great job and I'm happy to see very famous Bollywood actors crossing over into Hollywood.Overall, 10/10, one of Nolan's best movies, and out of the Interstellar/Inception/Tenet sci-fi trio, I'd place it at the top or alongside Interstellar but superior to Inception.",Tenet

Awful dialogue

The music is unbearable
Quality of sound and clarity is some of the worst I've ever heard. You can barely understand what half the people are saying.

It adds nothing great to the plot (the plot itself also being boring with a few twists here and there that in the end don't matter that much).
Characters were done really bad. I know this sounds really cliche, as everyone says that about this movie, but it is absolutely true. Tenet avoids any character development, and instead it focuses on the plot and the concept, which, as I said previously, aren't that good or interesting.
The main mistake a piece of writing can make (novel, short story, movie, TV series...you name it) is, in my opinion, not developing the characters. It gets to the point where you don't even care about them. If they were killed you wouldn't mind...at all.
Tenet makes that mistake.All in all, I'm left with the impression that this could have worked better as a TV series. That way, there would be more time to develop the characters and also more time to explore the concepts.",Tenet

4188,luanskrelja,All is revealed,4,8 September 2020,"When I first watched the trailer I thought It was going to be one of those movies like ""Shutter Island"", ""Inception"" and other famous titles that leave you with a grudge (a nice grudge) at the end. You know those that makes you want to dig your nails into your keyboard to find out if leonardo wore his ring at the end of the inception movie to see if he was dreaming or not.The beginning of this movie was harsh and I can see how people might dislike it a lot because of that. Since it gives no context what-soever to the story we're watching.The only thing it did was ""Kill"" the protagonist, therefore leaving him to look into the inversion phenomenon.
And if you were allready put off by this, then the rest of the movie probably wasn't, or won't be pleasent for you.
it cuts off harshly and if you don't pay attention, you will lose track of it.But I'm not one of those people, that's reviewing this badly because he/she didn't understand it and now I'm angry and want to provoce those feelings, by rating this titel badly. No, I am not that kind of person.My complaint is that I understood it too well, I did not leave with questions, that could not be answered by, someone who had stronger ears than me, because they heard the text better, Over the very loud Music (this was also a very big problem, espescially if the subtitles do not match the text, when you actually hear the lines, spoken by the actors).Every mistery, every complication and thought was explained and it was like listening to a lecture that you allready heard before.
when the protagonist is trying to get through the door and there's a dead body behind it, with a special keychain, DO NOT, show us the keychain on Neil (the protagonists Friend/partner) in slow motion, so that every mororn understands he was the one that died for him. leave it a mistery just like with inception.
Everytime he is in the dream, he wears a ring, at the end he doesn't, case closed, but only if you watch it more than twice.Tenet is a one Ticket see, all complications are easely explained, just like the grandfather paradox which is mentionned more than twice in this movie.(you can't kill your grandfather, before one of your parents were concieved, since it would kill you, therefore killing the future you who's killing his grandfather. a paradox). When the protagonist says ""If we're alive now, doesn't that mean we succeeded?"", and neil answering, with the timeline theory, giving us slight doubt. And yet at the end the thing the characters have been screaming in our faces, that it can't really happen because of the paradox and so on, turns out to be true, WHAT A COINCIDENCE.Anyone who didn't understand this movie either didn't wan't to, didn't care to, didn't know what they were about to watch or just stuck on each thing they didn't understand.I kind of knew/guessed that Neil was from the future the first time we saw him, because that's a big cliche in movies like this. ""Tadaa I actually knew you from the begining and didn't mention it, but now since you saw my keychain and know I am going to die, why not tell it now.""I just want to say if you just opened my comment and start from the bottom to see how I end it, please read with care, this movie is ok yet decieving for what it promises.Thank you for reading so far if you did.I enjoy reviewing movies with a critical eye, since it helps me let go of mistakes I've made, like thinking this movie was going to be awsome.",Tenet

Tenet leaves you with questions at every line and action. Never have I been so floored by the desire to understand. Watching the movie is a fun game of feeling like you are completely in the loop and realizing you are completely unaware of what is happening. Somehow, you are able to grasp just enough of the plot to hang on with a vice-like grip. It felt like a wickedly tricky puzzle squealing to be solved. Personally, I love the challenge of trying to keep pace (and if possible, ahead of the story). It was delightful experience for a brain that has been living in the slumber of post-quarantine.

But after the second watch, this movie has just proven to be one of my top three Nolan films. IT IS, LITERALLY, A MASTERPIECE. The audio was spot on (seriously) because it created so much intensity and strength to the whole film. Some actors are hiding some information in some scenes (no spoilers) so it looks like they aren't great actors. However, it is because they are hinting the viewers which inversion phase they're in. Yes, I know it is confusing, that's just because each character has different inversion phase. You just have to watch it multiple time for everything to click in your head.

I will have to watch this movie a few more times to understand better what I just witnessed, and I will gladly do that!The best way to describe this movie shortly would be probably to just say that Tenet absolutely does not underestimate the viewer or try to explain things too much.

4202,kaizen314,The Kopfkino of Nolan,7,6 April 2021,"My impression of this film, with all due respect to Christopher Nolan's prominent elitist status as a award winning filmmaker, starting when he was seven years old, presents the irreversible and thematically unbendable habitual culmination of his past portfolio of ""trade mark"" expositions that is a collective obsessive psychologically handicapped auteurs Kopfkino.I was anticipating TENET's release as a refreshing reprieve from the ""predictable"" ""formulary"" productions distributed on our plethora of ""app"" streaming (advertising) venues, et.al.; that amount to a forced choice subscription consumer venue. Of course, the enormous emphasis of what makes a film a blockbuster, aside from the production budget, is based on the allegorical ""fighting for survival of the entire world"" is open to interpretation, yet I don't know if Nolan's going to win my respect back after this. Why?The premise based on an unnamed CIA operative, recruited into a mysterious organization (Mission Impossible plotline) slips away and vanishes into this clandestine assignment, targeting (OMG not another Russian oligarch) with the ability of creating electronical inversions and future intrusions into present reality, while plotting to destroy the world (Ian Fleming's Dr. No), theme is like sand between the fingers in its recreation of the future ""hard cut"" snippets slipping into our present existence. Where the cause comes before the effect without reference of Quantum Mechanics.Respectfully, the viewer must pay attention to the rapid dialogue (turn on the subtitles) to transcend from the linear construct into Nolan's trademark of nonlinear cinematic imagery compounded by the ""multiple timelines"" peppered with the same themes, emotions, and sellable message that showcase the character's in a magical sense of mastering the ""inversion"" of future time inversion,And yet, there is an overlapping formulary injected; based upon the ""crime doesn't pay"" outcome in Nolan's conceptual ouroboros, the dragon is eating its own tail.The structure is a catered smorgasbord of cinematic optics jumping backward and forward in sync with Nolan's characteristic signature non-linear template, juxtaposed to the unique Oneiric themes exploring the perceptional reality of human consciousness, sliced in quantum leap sections that reverse the chronological order founded upon the Russian formalism of ""Fabula"" (the meat of the story) and ""syuzhet"" how the narration is organized.Building upon the peppered action-packed - often portrayed in reversed suspense ""action-figure"" portrayal - becomes overly exaggerated to the point of mimicking an online video game. So the question is this: Does this ""dimensional structure"" intellectually and emotionally expand our awareness of connecting to the future, comparably, say to Stanley Kubrick's iconic timeless masterpiece, 2001? My point being we've come to judge cinematic excellence by how much ""eye candy"" is thrown in through technologically advanced SFX.To keep the audience glued to the screen, Chris Nolan's TENANT is framed (a typical style of his) with ""hard cuts"" and ""explosive brawls"" with ""revolving camera angles"" that are overly portrayed in his films today.Out of due respect to his trademark quality, TENET exposes and defines the complexity of Nolan's own Kopfkino philosophical exposition that has reached the point of becoming an exhausting apathetic cinematic trope.What is innovative in the subtext is the shift from the Hero's Journey to the archetypal Protagonist (character's name) Journey. I found this shift progressively redeeming. Here is a glimmer of genesis in Nolan's approach but it's overshadowed by his innate subconscious doubts regarding screenplay formatting that if we defy or question our human narrative storytelling format, will we be deprived of the choice between the ""lampshade"" dualistic paradigm between good and evil? Thus, the habitual protagonist's conflict imprinted upon the cinematic screen to make that choice remains pervasive.With TENET, Nolan attempts to grasp at the revelation of all of the laws of nature versus nurture and inverts them into a retrospective, often times slipping back into his ""Dark Knight"" malevolence ""that confines his creative reality into the habitual challenging of our hedonistic pursuits within a dreadful disharmony and social injustice driven by nuclear and technological evolutionary threats.What was missing, though again Nolan's trademark of justified spectacle of beefy grandiosity of human despair was well detailed, was seizing control of the cinematic quality that falters in this film to alter the fabric of reality through the dreadful outcome that threatens generations to come, given the unresolved denouement moment at the ending.Nolan has clearly established his cinematic signature out of conjuring ""misdirected"" illusion through the medium of transposition cinematic presentation.So why do some viewers encourage rapacious repetitive viewing of TENET to ""get it""? Personally, I enjoy watching many ""quality"" films, spanning decades and foreign productions over and over, not because I didn't understand the story, but because they are entertainingly superb masterpieces of the cinematic art form. TENET isn't one of them.And I qualify my statement, in terms of psychological and philosophical ethics, because the principle premise that captures escapist audiences who thrive in this genre of ""glitzy cinema"" is that they're caught in the simplest illusion of their own isolated reality that is in fact a reinforcing, never ending, Mobius strip rerun of the past.",Tenet

This film is intended to involve the viewer with its content in such a way that, each viewer's overall response is likely to be directly proportional to how much HEAVY lifting he or she is willing to do in his or her interaction with its concepts.If I were to guess, I would say that most viewers came to appreciate the film ONLY AFTER: 1) the film was complete, AND 2) they took the time to mentally work through and process the information. There in lies this film's novelty, I believe.The story, concepts, and visuals, are pretty creative and mind-blowing! But they're also overwhelming because they are tied together in such a new way, have multiple variables, and are only fit into two and a half hours.YET, I believe once the viewer has taken the time to understand the pieces that Nolan is using, conceptually and visually, he or she can greatly appreciate the film for a pretty innovative work of art.I give it a 6.8/10, because I appreciate the final product Nolan created as a visual storyteller and artist, but I think he could have communicated everything a little more clearly and polished. That is, with respect to some of the more technical aspects: the sound mixing seemed a little rushed, as well as some of the scenes, acting, and dialogue.Overall, I enjoyed it. But much of my enjoyment came a good time after the film had ended and I was able to work it all out.

The dialogue was hard to hear at times which makes you have to pay even more attention to what was going on. I dare to say I was confused for the first 20 minutes but then caught on. I knew I would have to watch it again, and just like Inception or Interstellar, you understand more of the science and dwell deeper into the discussion points.

Was this deliberate? Because I read the synopsis and I didn't miss any of the broad strokes, but the finer nuances completely escaped me.Like why I should care about any of these characters or their relationships. For a film that emphasizes the importance of the Protagonist, everyone else gets a name but he doesn't. I found that strange and off-putting. And the ""mother's love"" that rang completely hollow. Like I'm supposed to care about the parent child relationship of a woman whose interaction with her child is reduced to a chauffeur - whether on a boat or in front of a school.Too much is explained in this film and not enough is shown.It was like the characters have been reduced to ciphers that serve as expositors of the high concept but in no way inhabit any real emotional dimension in past present or future reality. It's like the dialogue has been deliberately obscured in the sound design so as to prevent us from observing glaring logical inconsistencies as the premise hangs together by a single red thread.I love Nolan's work but this movie I don't love.

4228,eshkamarsu,My Favorite Nolan Film but Not for Everybody. 10/10 for me!,10,10 January 2021,"For me personally, TENET is marvelous. I am a huge fan of his and love all of his movies, and I really enjoyed TENET! But, it's not a movie for everybody because the film is very complex and therefore can be inaccessible to audiences.It is 100% Nolan's most complex and ambitious film and because of that it is a movie that a lot of people like myself will love, but, there will be a lot of people who won't like it as well. But the movie embraces it's complexities and ambitiousness and basically says 'you're either with it or not'. And I personally love that!I think the movie has a LOT to praise, particularly how well crafted it was and how much attentiveness and how audacious it is. Visually, it's a treat and something to marvel at. The things that Nolan accomplishes in camera with minimal visual effects is incredible. People move forwards and backwards at the same time in multiple shots and the execution of that was simply incredible. The action sequences are all beautifully helmed and so incredibly well crafted and each of them are just simply very unique and different. It's nonstop action throughout the entire film and it's stunning to see!Now, the story is definitely Nolan's most complex and it makes you think a LOT, but, the amount of detail that went into the story and screenplay is remarkable. For me, I was able to understand the big picture plot and the overall progression of the story on the first viewing but on repeat viewings I was able to understand more and more. Which is what Nolan wants and designed this film to be - which I think is a plus!The whole criticisms about 'having cold characters' or 'too much exposition' or 'sound mixing' I think is overstated and a bit unfair. While I understand where they are coming from, I wholeheartedly disagree.First, in regards to the characters, their backstories are vague, yes, but, if you look at the movie and the progression of the story, it's not necessary to know everything about them, particularly the lead - The Protagonist - In fact, Nolan said himself that he wanted to focus on the 'here and now' with TENET and therefore I had no problems with the characters. Again, there will be have a problem with this but given that the intention was to focus on the situations in the movie versus providing a character study, I think it was executed very well.Second, the issue of too much exposition, while there is a lot of characters taking leisurely strolls through very exotic environments, that has happened in Inception too, and I don't recall anybody having issues with Inception on it? Why is it that people have issues with it in TENET? I personally didn't mind that one bit.Third, the issue of sound mixing. There are obviously some lines that he deliberately made a little difficult to hear, but, me personally, I found the dialogue crystal clear on every single watch (And I've seen it 6x in the theatre and have it on ITunes now as well). But, my friend who I saw the movie with on my second viewing had difficulty hearing some lines. So I guess it's a matter of whether you are paying attention or not and things of that sort, but, I personally had no issues with it at all.And, also, it is an intentional choice, just like the other things - he wants you to feel the movie and enjoy the experience before you break it down and understand all the dialogue and story intricacies, etc. and that is why he chooses to do that. The sound mixing is so bombastic that it elevates the way you experience the scenes, at least for me.I think a key example to look at is his film Inception. It's not widely critiqued for it's sound mix, but, it for most it took multiple viewings to really understand it. On the first watch, a lot of the movie's fast paced exposition isn't really all that easy to follow, but, the action scenes are exciting and different, with big and bombastic sound effects and music, without giving the audience much time to digest it. So, for a person watching Inception for the first time it is totally understandable for them not to get an action scene because they're still trying to digest the story, but, that's why he wants you to feel the film before anything else -You don't really need to understand every ounce of dialogue or every level of Inception to enjoy the action set pieces and the spectacle. If you simply accept what is going on and follow the basic plot points without trying to wrap your head around every nook and cranny in 1 sitting - you'll have enough to feel the movie even if you don't grasp everything, bringing me back to TENET -I think a lot of people went into this expecting to understand the entire movie in 1 sitting, but, that was never going to happen. It's never been the case with any of his previous work. And it certainly was never going to be the case with TENET. Nolan crafted this film over a span of a decade, so nobody can get this in one sitting, not even the man creating it! So, there is literally no point in trying to.In conclusion, TENET is a bold and unquestionably dense sci-fi action epic, and that is the exact word I would use to describe the movie: epic. Every second I was watching this movie, I felt like I was watching something incredibly transportive, and I truly felt like I was at those locations, those set pieces that Christopher Nolan made - they were truly incredible and some of them have never been done before!So, it's totally worth it and I wholeheartedly disagree with any negative press about the movie, it's amazing! 10/10 for me!",Tenet

The way this all plays out on the screen is enthralling, and then various reveals really landed for me. It bends your mind in a totally new way.What really took away from this movie for me was the decision to have the music and background noises be so loud, and be layered over the top of the speech. It makes it really hard to hear what the characters are saying. From what I've read online this was a decision, not an accident, but it seems to me to have been a bad decision. It will probably stop me watching the film again, as I can remember the frustration in so many scenes where I can't quite hear what each character is saying.",Tenet

4236,angusmayall,Obnoxiously Complex with the Occasional Saving Grace,3,19 September 2020,"First all I'll say this is, to date, the only film I've ever had to walk out of the cinema from. And I've even sat through Movie 43.I'll start with a couple of positives. The 2 action sequences in the first hour and a half are semi-decent (even if the music score is deafening), and Robert Pattinson's acting was very good (despite not having a clue who his character is and his purpose in the film).Now on to the negatives. From the onset we are introduced to a nameless protagonist who works for some never confirmed organisation, and is then drafted into another never confirmed organisation. This character procedes to jump between locations in short scenes, meeting other dull characters who serve no purpose except leading the protagonist on an easter egg hunt and usually have completely unintelligible dialogue sequences. I'm not sure if this is a fault with the sound design, but this issue is not helped by other scenes where characters shout over fuzzy radio channels with the overwhelming musical score drowning them out.After an hour and a half, myself and my girlfriend still had no clue what was actually going on, who any characters were or understood the purpose of the scene.I do understand the concept of a reversed entropy bullet or object is difficult to comprehend, however this is not helped by a needlessly complex and confusing plotline.

Plot twists thrown together for the sake of it which contradict themselves. It's like it was written over five years by 10 different people and then stuck together - it needed a re-edit at the end but someone ran out of time. We are told you must not meet in the parallel time line yet the main character fights himself. Bullets appear from no where yet we know they had to be shot at a certain time. Huge gateways are built to the future but you have to enter and exit at the same time. Grandfather theory this but what will be will be that. Yes big bangs, huge sets and some good Fight scenes.

The soundtrack is stunning but overpowering - so much so that I felt as though I missed a good 70% of the dialogue. The use of masks was creative to distinguish between forward and reverse but it was near impossible to understand what the characters were saying.The plot is confusing. Don't get me wrong - I am all for a good puzzle that slowly unfolds and you get an 'aha!' moment at the end. However, this film left me with so many questions. Why was the protagonist so intent on helping Kat? What was his motivation behind the whole 'painting in the airport' scene? Why was the russian antagonist so keen on ending the world? It is so unclear. I enjoyed the reverse entropy plot - it could have been executed SO much better though. Also, it is about an hour too long.+1 star for the score, and +2 for the incredible acting, especially by Robert Pattinson.I left the cinema feeling confused and lost - no doubt a second watch would clarify some things, but I have absolutely no desire to put myself through that again.",Tenet

Funny enough, I was able to catch the dialogue when I watched it on a standard screen, not IMAX. I agree the score is too loud and some dialogue is muffled, but if you watch more than once, you will understand the logic behind this movie.No spoilers here, but this is a movie that will take you in a journey covering 3 timelines (past, present & future). The idea of the movie has never been visited before and the execution was perfect. I will give this movie a 10/10 if only Nolan was more clearer and straightforward on the idea of the movie like Inception. In inception, you can know what is going to happen because the characters give you heads-up or a clue. In TENET, you have to be the protagonist and figure it out yourself which is not well received by some people.The ending of the movie could be a start for a sequel that can clear some doubts of the movie plot.I recommend watching it more than one time and preferably in a standard screen.

You'll somehow understand it by feeling it but you won't know how to explain it. And then you realize you have just witnessed a masterpiece of modern cinema and art.Yes there are its flaws. The common complaint is the audio mixing. You'll struggle to hear or understand what the characters are saying. Definitely need subtitles.

I've checked with others who saw it in different cinemas and they've said similar. The story is overly convoluted, and the characters have no depth.

After watching it; I was asked by family what it was about, and honestly couldn't tell them. The plot is difficult to follow, not only due to the complexities within it, but mainly because of how heavily this movie leans on dialogue to establish everything within this movie, and often the most important dialogue occurs during loud music, explosions, or behind a mask. Said dialogue often consisted of random scientific words thrown at you like plutonium, entropy, etc. and those scenes are always annoying because you know the movie is banking on you not understanding what they mean, and when you do it just deconstructs the entire gimmick of the movie.This movie had multiple moments which were really, really good. But for a movie based on the concept of inverted time, where getting immersed and suspending disbelief is crucial to enjoyment, these moments were too few and far between. I spent the majority of the movie playing catchup, and by the finale I was not in the slightest bit immersed and as such did not get to enjoy the suspense which was clearly being built. I still don't know who the final conflict was against, nor the point of the opening scene which just seemed so pointless.I didn't really enjoy this movie. I think there will be two camps- those who think it's a masterpiece, and those who don't know what the point was. I know if I rewatch Tenet I'll enjoy it more, and maybe if it ever comes on TV I'll switch it on and watch some of it, but it was too illogical, complicated, and overall unenjoyable for me to consider rewatching it.",Tenet

That's an absurd way to regard any film, but amid the business-minded panic and frustration of its chronic postponement, one wonders if director Christopher Nolan was secretly at least a little amused by the heightened mystique around it all. A blockbuster artist who tends to cocoon his works in ceremonial secrecy at the best of times, he has wound up releasing his 11th feature into an aptly disordered environment.

If we are rendering our planet inhabitable due to the excesses, wastefulness and ignorance of our generation and our predecessors, could our descendants want revenge and turn back the winds of time against us and erase our existence in an attempt to save their own?""A nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well.""TENET plays with the concepts of causality, free will and paradoxes. The film posits that paradoxes cannot be solved and that their consequences are unknowable. This is juxtaposed with the future's intention of annihilating the past, essentially creating a grandfather paradox. Perhaps, the people in the future have found a way to sidestep the paradox and create a different branch of reality?""Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided.""In a race to stop the villain - an egotistical, abusive and dying man - from transmitting the location of ""The Algorithm"" - a device that can invert the entropy of our environment - to the people in future, the film takes its characters through multiple mind-bending sequences resulting from the puzzling implications of Inversion. The film takes some artistic license in depicting the consequences of inversion and treats the audience with several massive set pieces - unique in parts, accompanied by an intense score to spectacular effect.""That part is a little dramatic.""With the global threat averted, TENET ends on a melancholic note as the friendship at the heart of the film comes to an end (and also begins), loose ends are tied up and the world remains unaware of what could have happened.""No one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the ones that did...""Although TENET packs too much plot for a two and a half hour film where everything cannot possibly be explained or understood by the audience on first viewing and it is easy to get lost into the intricacies of the mechanics of inversion, it is, nonetheless, a cinematic tour de force and a bold attempt at large scale, ambitious storytelling with a palindromic structure.

Is like you need to be chasing leads, but you are only looking for when and why because you know it's going to happen... to me the whole thing doesn't work. At least in the way they presented it, there was no surprise effect at all.The plans during the missions were not that elaborated, like putting four trucks around the van... and security guys driving it don't suspect anything. Fighting mano a mano with someone in reverse... that all of the suden disappear. Hiding parts of the scenes without a convincing explanation. The final battle shooting non sense. Explanations like the ""algorithm"", ""nuclear"", mixed with time and space paradoxes, ""time machine""... are just emptiness. Lack of creativity.The whole game of hiding and showing information, was easy to anticipate. Mainly because they were abusing again and again with the same resources (like putting mask on the characters when they cross timelines). I believe they were close to a great concept, timelines that cross each other or temporal branches were some scenes share the same characters moving back and forward in time.But writers were just lazy, this is lacking a soul, a deeper explanation, or a little twist at the end... they did not want to think... and they delivered a poor plot... clearly as they said ""ignorance"" is this movie ammunition.

4291,noahtjohnson-90256,Tenet unfortunately falls short of its own excellence,6,9 November 2020,"Tenet is another ambitious project from the prolific writer/director Christopher Nolan. I'm not as familiar with Nolan's filmography as I would like to be, only having seen his Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Dunkirk before. I was warm on Dunkirk but loved his tackling of Batman in a more grounded world, as well as the dreamscape of reality that was Inception.In fact Tenet almost feels like a companion piece to the aforementioned Inception. Both are incredibly high concept sci-fi, mess with reality and perception, and slowly loop back reveals to the viewer. Unfortunately I found Tenet to be, while visually stunning, ultimately lacking in any compelling story and insistent on showing off characters who seemed to be the same model with a new coat of paint.Nolan handles the ideas in his head expertly. But these ideas never seem to flourish like they should when put onscreen. In a film like Inception (which I rewatched for its anniversary only few weeks before Tenet) the ideas feel much better communicated, without just info-dumping the world onto the audience. In Tenet there are several discussions of inversion, but none of these seemed to match the clarity and engagement I got from Inception. This got me feeling very left behind while trying to cling onto the rapid pace of the film.That's another issue: the editing is very choppy and the music is overbearing. Dialogue is drowned out by Ludwig Göransson's heavy score and that then hurts the plot's movement by setting the audience behind the character. And that is if these scenes do move the plot. Some will only run for a minute and then move on, without any real story being continued at all. It felt like there was only some strands of connective tissue between the scenes and led to character motivations becoming weak and fuzzy.The cinematography is very well done. Plenty of iconic shots and movements. Nolan knows his framing and equipment, even in the fast-paced, always moving action sequences.The characters are weak as well. The Protagonist, played by John David Washington, is your standard main character, and I have no issue with that. But the side characters are very much the same.Robert Pattinson's character, Neil, is woefully underused. There's supposed to be a friendship blooming between the two, but the Protagonist is also very mistrusting of him the entire time. So there's this tension that never seems to break, even when Neil tells the Protagonist they're good friends. They lack a convincing growth, especially when Neil keeps popping in and out of the movie's plot.Speaking of unconvincing relationships, Elizabeth Debicki's character, Katherine, is supposedly building a romantic bond with the Protagonist. Only the romance is stale and lifeless, with barely any chemistry. Add to this her rivalry with her cartoonishly evil husband Sator, played by Kenneth Branagh, and she comes off as a very one note stereotypical love interest.The dialogue is rather bland. Every character talks the same, with witty remarks and one-liners, and every conversation moves at the same pace and rhythm no matter the situation around them.The action scenes are grand set pieces, and the way they're executed is amazing. Nolan can do practical effects like no one else, and he constantly keeps raising the stakes for himself. The plane crash is definitely the highlight of the film, with the last action scene added on as well. I feel these scenes would be better by themselves, however, rather than snaking the plot through them. Especially during the last action scene where everything happens at once and yet somehow still feels all over the place.I was very much looking forward to Tenet. The fighting with its reversed choreography, the practical effects, the grand action and the espionage. But unfortunately it got so wrapped up in its own cliches and cleverness that everything fell short of my expectations. Here's hoping Nolan delivers something even stronger in his next film.6/10",Tenet

After Inception and Interstellar I was hoping that this one is going to play with my mind but oh boy, the devilishly genius Nolan put craziness with insanity and reverse it back to make me feel like I was some lunatic with weak eyesight.This is the first film in a long time I am going to watch it dozens of times. Because the first time I had to concentrate a lot to understand it.It's a very good movie, ah, it's just more than good, it's a fabulous movie. Tenet is a class on its own.
I like complex and mind blending movies but Tenet takes it to a whole new level.
The story is just really great but the back story of the Protagonist is not discussed properly. I think that is for the future sequels or maybe for prequels.Anyway, I found it interesting, and very entertaining, the whole time I was on the edge of my seat.
The acting of Washington and Pattinson is awesome in this movie, I would like to say i like Pattinson more.
Do not give it bad reviews just because you did not understand the most entertaining film of 2020.

You come away likely confused and underwhelmed.In the BLUE timeline, you sit in a theater confused and underwhelmed, proceed to endure a movie that tries to do something new, even at the cost of its coherence, but get paid money afterwards.All things considered, after watching this movie, I wish I had been in the BLUE timeline instead of the RED.",Tenet

Poor, wooden acting (the protagonist wears the same blank expression for the best part of 2 hours), action scenes and storylines weaving around nonsensically, a soundtrack thats below par for a Nolan film, and sound editing that makes large parts of dialogue incomprehensible. It all makes one wonder at what point did Nolan's head get jammed so far up his backside that he could no longer tell which way was up.I lost interest in this movie after about 30 minutes. And not because of the poor storytelling (the plot twist was almost apparent in the first scene, and definitely apparent in the first major fight scene...).

The concept of the movie is genius like all of Nolan's movies. It takes an original director such as Nolan to translate such a concept into a fine movie. I think Nolan successfully was able to develop the idea in his own unique and genius way. when I watched it for the first time, I understood the concept of the movie, but sometimes I got lost in the details, for a couple of reasons. first, is the sound, sometimes I could barely hear the conversations, I think to follow the movie fully, you should be able to hear and analyze the movie (actually the music is way louder than the conversations. Maybe there is a reason for this and it is the intention of the director to make the dialogs and cheaters no too significant compared to the entire plot of the movie). 2. This is just my humble opinion as an amateur viewer; Sometimes it appeared to me that the scenes change were sudden and fragmented. It could be better to extend some scenes to make it appear more sequential. However, when I watched the movie for the second time and with a subtitle, it made more sense to me. I think to fully appreciate Nolan's movies you should watched them more than once, as there are hidden messages that is hard to get for the first watch. I should also mention that the music in this movie is amazing. My score is based on my opinion of the movie after I watched it for the second time.
In a time where big superhero movies that are full of special effects and empty content attract viewers and gain big box office, TENET is a blessing. So I think as a viewer, we should stop being lazy about movies (what I mean is, we should be more intellectually involved) and encourage the filmmakers to make more of these type of movies. My advice. Watch the movie for the first time, if you get it for the first time, Awesome, but if you didn't, don't be disappointed. watched it for the second time with a subtitle. you will enjoy it even more.",Tenet

You get the reality bending, anti-establishment themes and aloof heroes, but it lacks the humanity prior films had. Additionally, the films bases all on entropy - the second law of physics (chaos is inevitable); yet the premise is actually about equal and opposite reaction (i.e. inertia and in this movie's case a bullet moving forwards and backwards). In a typical Nolan movie, one surrenders prior expectations and goes with it, but this film lacks the handholding and aspiration to teach its viewers the new world.

This is a combination of dialogs seemingly having too much reverb and the ambience that always play a low-tune key throughout. For the majority of the movie you will guesswork on whatever was happening.Here is what has came to be the hallmarks of Christopher Nolan: mind-thriller with a focus on human element, while accompanied by an innovative concept in movie making. The last one is the only thing you should expect in this film.If you came into this treating it as a run-of-the-mill action movie - you will get the action, but also be put off by confusion at what exactly is going on and what is it that you suppose to get out of that action sequence. In other Nolan's films if even you can't understand the mechanics you will know at least if the 'good guys' win the fight. Unless you keep up with the conversations, you won't know exactly is the objectives of some of the action scenes. And if you already lost at the beginning, it only will get worse toward the end.If you came into this treating it as a classic Nolan - you (might) be disappointed. The exposition is short (even shorter than Interstellar) for what's going down, and the plot and characters are cliche as a whole. The emotions are deprived of passion, and few that are there are too one-dimensional to be invested in. And most important of all: there is no character development for the protagonist. He is the exact person he started out. You can say it's inversion thing, that it has to end the same way it would start, but in practical it will take out the enjoyment for the people who expect some level of metaphysical realization at the end. Some old fans might also suggest that it's just an obnoxious attempt by Chris to gather all the famous actors, putting them on a world trip and call it a movie. If you are those people who would think so, there's little anyone could say to convince you otherwise - you already decided with conviction to hate the movie forever.If you are a physicist and/or realist - you might get turned off from some elements. ""Bad guys can't aim"" trope is still here (considering bad guys in Inception are mostly non-human, it's a lot less defend-able here), and the specific details of how inversion would actually work is left up with the quote ""don't try to understand it, just feel it"". There's a lot of stuffs that doesn't make sense, and the more you delve into it the more convoluted it gets. There is a logical explanation for every 'plot-hole', but some people can find it unsatisfactory. But it will basically boil down to the interactions between inverted and non-inverted, at which point you have to leave it to creative realm.So who is left that could possibly enjoy Tenet?People aren't used to thinking in reverse. For me, just imagining how a subject would decay backward to the past already give mental exhaustion. But I like imagining it just because I'm a theoretical idealist.The movie will cover all the action-sequence playbooks. It will build you up like a tutorial, so you can prepare your mental comprehension for the next sequences. Because there is a LOT of genuine details that you will have to notice to enjoy the actions to its fullest. This is a movie solely about mechanics. If there is a visual answer to 'how would these mechanics play out in that situation?', Tenet would have it. And there are a lot of those situations. That is where the magic of the movie is. You question how it would go, and it delivers. The better you are at grasping and applying concepts, the more enjoyable the movie is. You will find yourself going awe again and again, just because it's such an impressive feat to put something so abstract in a film with so little visual effects. When you think about it like that, you will understand that the plot was only there to drive the 205-million-dollars budget worth of hypothetical vision to its realization.There will be things you have not seen for a Nolan film before: hip song, and slapstick. There will be things you have seen before in a Nolan film: great cinematography, and people in classy suits.So if something like 4D-cube intrigue your imagination, go watch the movie. The movie is worth all the exposure it can get. It will inspire the right people, and criticized by some of the wrong one too. If you 'feel' it, you will enjoy it.We all believe we'd avoid the movie we hate. But until we watch the movie, we can never know.",Tenet

4353,vic-56352,Pretentious and Overwrought,6,10 January 2021,"The credits for Tenet call out its production in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. If this is a ""spoiler"" so be it: the sound track on the streaming version of this movie is god-awful. And all the Fresh Tomatoes in the world can't make up for it. For all intent and purpose, it's as though the movie was edited in 2.1 sound and someone ran it through a ""Stadium Effect"" synthesizer in production.Virtually all sound radiates from the front two speakers. Even as, the action stage is all around us. Surround speakers serve little more than reverb. Worse, the cacophony of noise at high relative levels to speech leaves much of the dialogue incomprehensible to all but Bats. That's when the actors themselves aren't speaking with marbles in their mouths!The plot is standard action film - which is to say it's less than thin. While some reviews find it ""Fresh"", I could call it a mash up of ""Twelve Monkeys"" meets ""Edge of Tomorrow"". Whereas the latter asks only that you accept one plot point (infected people can repeat the past / see the future), this movie asks viewers to accept and synthesize no fewer than a handful of pop-science plot points that quickly fall apart under scrutiny. If the idea is to force the audience to work through a Rubrics Cube of weak premises, then I guess it succeeded. How does that saying go? ""If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bull****""!In the end I found this jumble of ideas grinding at best. Maybe it's a good thing the dialogue was obscured by the noise.",Tenet

Sure there is minutia that can be difficult to grasp, but I found the overarching narrative almost annoyingly simple.
Tell me if you heard this one before? The bad Russian man wants to blow up the world because of some dumbass god complex, so the suave hero has to get the thing (in this case a box), and connect it to a thing (in this case a helicopter), to save the whole wide world.That's the climax at least, before that there's a bunch of meandering incident that serves slightly different purpose. At one point they have to save the damsel in distress. At one point they have to discover who sold some bullets. It's all built out of very standard situations.One of the most annoying things about Tenet is that it is a film where it feels like every single line is explaining something new, but strip the narrative of its fat and you find the most basic Bond plot imaginable.
No matter how much pseudoscientific jargon Nolan throws into his mess, he can't turn that trite narrative into something inventive.",Tenet

4378,abhascarfreak,So damn good that it is just too good?,10,20 December 2020,"You read that right. Nolan's newest two-and-half-hour epic is just as good as all of it was teased to be, and so much more. It's something that will take at least two complete viewings to even partially understand the happenings, but that has never stopped me. That has been the tale with almost every other Nolan film. This just happens to be one of the best among them.The first time you watch the film, you won't be able to understand it in its entirety. It's impossible to do that. For some compensation, you can always try to follow the film's epic cinematography and score, and try to remember some key points throughout. This will help you immensely when you watch the film again.It's almost like you need to know the ending of the film just to understand how it works on the second viewing. It has happened in Inception before, and it's the same for Tenet now.I think that the movie received it's backlash for two very unrelated reasons. One, that it was released in the middle of the pandemic; and two, that it was so damn hard to understand the first time that many rather impatient people just gave up trying to understand it, and didn't even give the movie a second viewing. Knowing Nolan, it's almost a crime to not give his films a second viewing.I have seen it two times now, and I can happily and confidently say that the film is truly outstanding. Once you can identify the ins and outs of the entire premise, it is actually the epic movie that we wanted Nolan to give us. We wanted it, and he delivered beautifully. He can't be blamed because people nowadays can only digest romantic and linearly straightforward stuff which is really easy to understand and digest.It's almost like a line it the movie : ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" Except, once you do start to feel it, you do understand it. I did, and I came to know how much of a masterpiece Tenet actually is. Give it time, and maybe a couple more viewings. I'm sure all of you will 'catch up'.That's the end of my rant. I'm leaving to give the masterpiece another extremely deserved viewing. It's epic and addicting!",Tenet

Thank you for this entertainment of highest class Christopher!!In general I have to say It's incredible how Christopher and Jonathan are putting movies together!! I have been a big fan from the Memento movie and their work is impressive. This one is combining many different sequences of timeline and if you are into details you will enjoy ever second of it!! It also features a lot of turning points and you should keep up understanding it. Thats probably why the rating is below 8 or 9 sometimes.. kind of that movies are not to watch for lazy days. You really have to feel every detail, then you will rate a 10 for sure. Also the acting quality is on another level. My biggest credits to the actors who are making this piece to a unique art.In general I have to say that Nolan movies are one of the most in-depth movies I ever saw. There is rarely something to compare to it. All of them like Inception, Prestige or Interstellar have turning point that are beyond any imagination of the viewer. Tenet is combining different styles of them.Thanks both of them to be in entertainment business and fulfilling our movie times with such special and emotional moments. It's a very big work and I'm enjoying to be part of it as a viewer. I'm glad to have been in the artist era of Spielberg, Nolan, Cameron and music artists like Michael Jackson.Thank you for entertaining the world on the highest level.

In this way, he (Nolan) can make the most horrible, loudest, unintelligible, empty, ridiculous, boring movies in history and still be adored by critics and audiences. There is no other explanation, or maybe there is? It could be that by saying that a Nolan movie is horrible, you could be considered an uneducated, unintellectual person, or simply a moron who can't understand a genius. Well, as those who give 10 to this embarrassment of a movie say, maybe you have to see it more times, many more, to understand it. Are you kidding me? Movies are an emotional experience not a riddle or a labyrinth that you have to watch and watch to know what the movie is about. I mean, everyone has to say the Emperor is clothed when he is obviously naked. And in this simulation, Nolan is completely naked even though most NPC see him in clothes, or in other words, love his movies. Where does this leave me or the few thousand of us who can see the truth? Why can we see the truth?

4405,wigtaylo,"Took 2+ Watches to Puzzle it together, but BRO..",10,29 December 2020,"Listen, I don't usually leave reviews but Tenet deserves one. After watching this movie for the first time, I sat back and uttered a large ""WHAT"", as if I was hoodwinked out of 20 dollars and 3 hours of time. I like Nolan movies, from the Prestige, to Batman, to Inception, I was ready for all the mind bending that could happen, and gleefully looked forward to seeing this in theaters. But this...this movie left me with the biggest question mark face I could ever muster, and I refused to give up without understanding it. Confused and disappointed after the first viewing was an understatement. There's no way this movie could be such a badly constructed plot of a heist movie that it tries to disguise itself to be. I couldn't help but go back and watch it a second time, just out of my sheer dumbfounded-ness.MAN! When I tell you that by the end of the second go around, everything, and I mean everything started to make sense. From the color choice of blue/red to denote time inversion, or the fact that the beginning scene literally drops you into the end of the movie, it all makes sense. If this movie was any more ballsy it would have showed the credits at the beginning as soon as you started it, that's how trippy and mind bending it is. If you watched it once and don't understand, watch it again. If Nolan comes out with a Tenet 2 from the perspective of Neil, I would gladly pay again, just to answer any of those additional open ended questions Nolan loves to leave behind.Halfway through the first go around, I thought Washington was a terrible actor, but he grows on you, monotonous at times, but a few cheeky jokes here and there to keep you engaged and with the addition of Pattinson they really feed off of each other. Pattinson was great at provides steady support throughout, and you could see in real time the layering of their friendship being displayed as the movie goes, you start wondering who ""Neil"" really is, and why can he speak Estonian.TRIPPY, that's all I can say. If you are looking for a surface level suspense thriller this is NOT for you. Nolan manages to swing not only for the fences, but for the park lot...across town, and nearly pulls it off. Biggest gripe I had is that the music is entirely too overpowering at times that leaves some of those soft spoken key scenes barely audible. The score almost works against you in cases where your trying to puzzle piece those ""Ah Ha!"" moments together.",Tenet

4408,bbigge,Terrible storytelling,2,2 January 2021,"An absolutely terrible piece of storytelling. No sign posting, no world building, no character development, mumbled dialog that made it hard to follow and with a jarring soundtrack that seemed out of place, perhaps it was deliberate but it didn't work for us. The editing was jumpy as well, and not due to the time bending story. It felt sloppy, like a B list, straight to TV movie of the kind they give to young directors to test them out on, except it had the visuals and acting of a big budget movie.Underneath it there is a decent idea that could be turned into a great film but despite the timey wimey reverse entropy theme the story told in this film was two dimensional - It needed to be four dimensional.",Tenet

The plot seemed like it was written by a high school student, and at no time did I feel interested in what happened to the characters in this film. There was no real character development and things just happened with very little explanation. Some of the effects were cool, but I found my self laughing in serious situations because of how incredibly cheesy this movie is.",Tenet

But in this movie an unique scenario of time travel is used which makes this movie outstanding. It's a must-watch movie for sci-fi movie lovers.,Tenet
4412,brizzip,On the threshold,6,4 January 2021,"I had a lot expectations, but, even if the movie is definetly good, is just a good film. Simply, overextimated. Anyway, I would recommend it for sci-fi lover who wants to elaborate on time travels a time paradox.",Tenet
4413,saigezhang,This is not only the audiovisual feast feast but a time travel,10,5 January 2021,"Well. No one can deny this movie is too complex to understand. But like the main character said,"" do not ask reason but feel it."" I feel extraordinarily joyful and excited after watching this film. This movie is the best, personally.First, a movie is an art, not only a story. I was not clever enough to understand the story clearly. But I enjoy watching this movie. I can understand roughly, and the complicated timeline does not affect enjoying it at all. For example, I cannot enjoy Picasso's abstract painting unless I have the ability to enjoy abstract painting. But I can still find the fun part from a random abstract painting. We called it popular abstract painting - regarding the commercial film in the picture filed. This movie is a commercial film for all, so do not try to understand the movie for the first time watching.Second, I felt I went through a time travel after watching this film. I felt like I have some connections between the past and the future. This film is the only movie that can give me such a feeling. In other words, this film is the first movie that tells me a great story, but give me a free ticket for time travel! For example, I washed my pajamas before watching this movie, after which I felt like me in the future told me to pass these pajamas by me-in-the-future! I was messed up in such a feeling. To be honest, the weeds cannot give me such a feeling.Last, it is the first time that this movie stimulated my sensory organs through the reverse technology used in the film for the first time. There are a lot of films that have been directed since the first movie born in the 1800s. This is the first that used many many reverse technologies. It is a general technology, but Nolan used this perfected and told me a good story. I love Nolan's style in his movies. Like inception and memento. Their structure does not flow. However, in this movie, even time is no flow at all. How exciting!I Love this movie. I want to give 100 stars to this movie. I definitely recommended it for the movie lover. I do not recommend it for children or people who watched a few movies.",Tenet
4414,vdfz,A Russian point,5,6 January 2021,"Not going to judge the artistic qualities of this movie, nor the scifi twists of the plot. I just could not ignore yet another slander on Russian side. Once again, a fairy tale is made about a bear-like Russian hatching crazy plans to ruin the world. Just out of his jealousy, because he is going to die soon anyway. I declare, with a deep sense of responsibility, that we Russians are not dying any time soon. We are content to face the future. It's the West the wind is blowing from, hinting about their existential problems, which must have led to those crazy ideas of reversing the time. Maybe it's their rivers that ran dry that they can't look towards the future any more? And now they are projecting their own problems on us Russians, planning to rob us of our state, our way and our natural resources on a made up pretext.On the other hand, there's a self-proclaimed protagonist, bonded to his ""tenets"" that came to him out of nowhere (did CIA produce the movie?). ""Ignorance is his ammunition"". That's what is really threatening, a fanatic devoted himself to save the world ""from what might have been"". God only knows what he might deem necessary to save the world from after seeing this movie!I give 5, because it at least has shown the state of mind across the ocean.Stay safe.",Tenet
4415,SiavashM357,Unintentional Self-parody,3,7 January 2021,"Possible Spoilers AheadFirst of all, I completely understand the plot and themes. Actually the story is not that complicated or even confusing, it's just a messy narrative and also you can't hear anything; more on that later.Highly dynamic mixing of sounds and loud emotional music, worked great in Interstellar, why? Because Interstellar is a pretty emotional and simple story and half of the time, if you don't hear something, it's actually okay; the picture is crystal clear. But they essentially did the same thing with Tenet, and it's terrible for this film because it's mostly an action/pseudo-logical movie, not an emotional one. Just because something worked in one of your movies, doesn't mean it will work every time, for a different movie.More often than not, the music is surprisingly irrelevant to the movie and it's annoyingly present all the way through; again, this is not Interstellar. The Music is not bad, it's actually good music, but the continual presence of mostly intense music, makes the movie feel really cheap and boring, it's like they wanted it to be exciting all the time which we all know, it's a terrible plan; you need good dialogue, characters, competent writing and decent scenes to be exciting, not an everlasting irrelevant soundtrack on every scene and specially the scenes that should be emotionally tense or even quiet to have their effect.Almost all the characters are Deus ex machina, there's no reason for any of them to be there; they're there to advance the plot and this is done in a very obvious and lifeless manner. Because of this, there is almost no tension whatsoever. Also the characters don't feel real; they have no story or motivation, you don't connect with them, they don't even have names (he's literally called the protagonist). All in all, you feel nothing towards them, so there is zero tension in any of the action scenes.The villain is hilariously unbelievable, it's like he's from a cartoon from the 60s. When this clichéd Russian oligarch shouts, it's just unintentionally humorous; it has no tension or weight. I burst out laughing when he said ""Vengeful b---h! Living off me!"" And this happens multiple times in the movie. What is the goal in scenes like this? The writing is humorously tasteless, the music and sound design is horrible in these scenes, acting is rudimentary, and even the blocking is ghastly; especially that specific scene feels like a soap opera with expensive equipment.There is some degree of triteness in the film, like really bad one-liners (""one man's whatever"" or ""if I can't have you, no one else can"", ""Because anger scars over into despair"", etc.) These cheesy lines do not belong to this movie, and the delivery just makes them worse. At some point someone says ""Don't do this, this will ruin everything"" and then the character goes ahead and does exactly that (which reminded me of low quality comedies) with no consequences whatsoever.There are some scenes in the movie that could be removed completely and nothing will change. Like the intro is a complete waste of time and has nothing to do with the movie. Or the scene that they go to that apartment, just to find out that the guy is not important and the lady is with them. The inversion concept seems cool at first, but they don't actually develop it, and if you think about it a little; you'd see hundreds of glaring errors and plot holes that it just becomes absurd and not in a good way.I think unconsciously, they mixed the music and sound effects so loud, because it's pretty embarrassing if you hear the actual dialogues in this movie.I give it a 3 out of 10, just because it has some nice action scenes and practical effects, which from a technical standpoint, this is the highlight of the movie.
Everything else? Unintentional Self-parody.",Tenet

4417,bobflynnusa,utter rubbish,1,7 January 2021,"Some viewers/fans seem to almost want to flagellate themselves over the ""complexity"" and ""beauty"" of this ""masterpiece"" however, this is a universe where Trump is president so take everything with a large clump of salt.The film is utter rubbish and if I could I would give it negative points in a futile attempt to reclaim some of my lost hours of life.
Note: I'm not mad at Mr. Nolan because interstellar was pretty great!I could summarize the plot with respect to the movie but that's no fun. So imagine someone gives you a rubik's cube and gives you 2h 30 minutes to solve it, all the while changing the little colored squares when your back is turned. Now that might make it appear more complex and mysterious but in reality is just annoying nonsense.The physics makes no sense, the plot makes no sense. The action scene's are boring and a repeat of mission impossible. The ""bad"" guy's reason to destroy the world is pointless.
I suspect the movie is a trial run for John David Washington as the next bond? He was very good in the fight scenes.
It's possible also a softener to see Robert Pattinson in action before the release of the next badman.I read one review where Elizabeth Debicki was noted for doing the best with her dull character and I agree, not much else she could have done.I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, first and only one, that's a testament to how utterly contrite (spelled with an S) it really was.I would have much preferred if the money to make this was donated to save the dolphins or threatened fungi.",Tenet

4426,lesprofoto,Audible issues again,3,12 January 2021,"I'm convinced Nolan has canine ears, he must, his hearing is far superior than that of his audience. Considering the backlash he got from ""Inception"" regarding audio - Nolan has chosen to completely ignore criticism and repeat the same mistakes in ""Tenet"".This film screams for more character development and/or backstory. I'm typical one who loathes flashbacks for the sake of character development but this film requires it. Nolan should have indulged his audience with at least one 3 minute scene where a nerdy college professor interjects his professional theories with some creative chalkboard drawing describing the grandfather paradox in a visual way. - And NO! it is not unknowable! Perhaps a little skit from Michael Caine about the butterfly effect would have tidied up the ending a bit.For the intellectual types yes, you will want to watch this film at least twice possibly thrice so you can ignore the visual thematic elements and concentrate more on the why and how. You will pick up a thing or 2 that was initially missed in your first viewing but you won't feel any better for wasting another 2 & 1/2 hours.

The women are merely plot devices and the DV with the lead woman is glamorized; at one point she shows her bullet wound in an almost seductive manner.The special effects are interesting, I guess, but not groundbreaking. As many have mentioned, the dialogue and sound effects have about a 70 decibel difference.The acting felt flat.

I've seen Tenet once, I'll have to view it again, but upon first viewing, as awesome as the visuals and the sound design is, my main struggle to care for this film comes from the lead protagonists not having much of a backstory, I just didn't care about the characters or understand why they cared about each other?The espionage elements of what fictional organisations or groups were involved in the film were way too vague in the exposition of their origins, who's leading them and what the purpose even is, the antagonists evil existential purpose did become evident, but errr, this movie is just all style and pretend substance.I felt like the obscure storytelling innovations such the winding backwards jumping thing because of inertia or whatever, may make it look interesting and to some very abstract understanding of scientific principals, it seems legit, but it makes for an almost completely uninterpretable film.
Maybe I'll have a revelatory understanding and appreciation upon my second viewing, it is possible.There are other Time Travel Films that are way more enjoyable to watch though and some that deal with even more complicated scenarios, but manage to pull off deeper characters and a more understandable story.

It's amazing that the reviews for this movie are practically the same, which goes without saying the the flaws were obvious. Nolan has carried the theme of intelligent storylines too far and has written something so layered and complicated that the underlying concept become unimportant. You have to hold on to the storyline like a roller coaster, and the multi-layered plots upon subplots start to resemble a chopped, tossed salad about 1/4 of the way through. It's not brilliant, it is Interstellar with a PhD - repurposed but with different theories rooted in Physics. It's as if a Stanford particle physicist made the leap to Hollywood and needed to put his education to some kind of good use, and the studio execs are just too embarrassed to admit they can't understand the concepts Nolan uses to tell a violent story about time travel. That his overuse of the reverse/forward film effect that creates a candy-coated visual when it first appears, but soon dulls as is overrun with inconsistency (the main female lead sees herself at the end - both moving forward in time is an obvious one). The dialogue is impossible - probably the first time I have heard 3 British dialects in the same movie (cockney, proper, Irish/Scottish/English), and the lead actor speaks in a low, dull whisper at times. Washington happens to be too slick for this movie. It suppresses his cool factor by forcing him into a subdued gentleman Bond-like operative. He is constrained at times by the director, and it's tough to see him paired with Edward from Twilight. It's unfortunate that Nolan didn't allow the attraction to blossom between the female lead and Washington. Is there really another reason why this character would try so hard to keep her and her son alive, and to let the universe almost implode to do it? Did Nolan think we could not handle an interracial romance in a thriller movie? Once again Hollywood fails to break out of its diversity rut. What a shame. His main strength is his cold stare, and about to bust you into a million pieces attitude which is downplayed. It's too bad since he could have kicked time travel in the rear if he was allowed to play himself. This movie is a primary example why Hollywood will have a very hard time returning to its glory days pre-pandemic: we have seen too many good series and movies that were made outside of the studios, and we expect so much more than explosives and bad casting. Nolan needs to make a movie that outside of this storyline. Interstellar can not be touched in my opinion it's one of the greatest movies ever made and cast. He is no doubt the best director and writer of our time, but he is stuck in time in a classroom writing the same movie over and over. Skip this movie, watch Interstellar and BlacKklansman. If you do watch it, put the subtitles on and turn down the sound - you can't hear the actors anyway.",Tenet

John David Washington is short and ugly, have zero charisma and is a horrible actor. Everything he says sounds boring and strained. A wooden plank has more appeal than this fn guy.Perhaps this boring and bleak movie would have been a little less boring if they had hired a proper actor - or just about anyone else.Other bad things in the movie were the boring soundtrack, the cliché russian by Kenneth Branagh, and the cliché countdown clock.All this in a lifeless, sterile and joyless borefest.",Tenet

There are technical issues including sound mixing to the point where the Score overpowers the movie dialogue. I love Ludwig's work but Nolan I feel pushed the envelope a little too much that it becomes a drawback to the movie experience. Beyond that the plot was not as strong and felt the character development was not that great. Kenneth Branagh did a good job but was too one dimensional as a villain with a weak plot. Was sad to see as villains in other movie like Thanos were given a great backstory. Overall, it's still a great movie to watch with all the action and would still recommend the impressive 70 mm imax version.",Tenet

If you don't believe me, be my guest to waste your precious time. If a movie pushes you to watch more than once or twice to simply understand it then this movie is worthless. I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan and his Interstellar is still my favourite. Interstellar and inception had mind-blowing complexity but on a decent level, and you can understand what's really going on inside of it with just a little extra push of focus. Most importantly no heart in this story. There's no character build-up. You won't feel that there's a friendship between the protagonist and Robert Pattinson's character. You'll never know this friendship really existed in this movie untill the end. They just meet and becomes friends out of nowhere. In the last moment Robert Pattinson had to explain it to him with words and that also includes the audience. Although Robert Pattinson did an amazing job. That's the only best thing I found so far. John David Washington's acting was really bad. Never felt like he's playing the most important character of the story. The way Nolan tried to give his character an impression like Ethan Hunt from mission impossible or simply James Bond but he lacks the personality. It didn't really feel like he's fit for that world saving important job. Everything happened too quickly and they didn't even try to explain it from where the time-reverse technology came from, how it came. Nothing. Again, they gave us the information about it just by simply saying they got the device from the future. To be honest Nolan chose a brilliant topic but i think this is the first time he failed so badly to explain his unique vision. I never felt so disappointed. I wasn't expecting this much of bad experience after getting so many masterpieces from him. He ruined a perfectly sci-fi thriller story. Sad there will not be a second chance.",Tenet

I have watched it twice as of now and can say with confidence that this is his best work since Inception. Not only he plays with time here as we saw in The Interstellar (2014) but creates a new ground of reality altogether. A lot of exposition thrown at you with a whole lot of Jargons to follow which are explained so fast that you can't even blink your eye and I am serious ( so much for Tight editing 😁).The film is visually a treat and as we all know Mr. Nolan has a habit of using Real props and strict NO for CGI, the end result is just mesmerizing. The scenes shot in Mumbai with Dimple Kapadia's Priya are just pure fun and captivating. In short you need to feel it rather understand it (It literally tells you in the beginning of the film).Even Narcissistic men can't possibly decode this unsolvable possible in one go let alone the others.The soundtrack is not by Hans Zimmer this time due to some Pre scheduled work, but Mr. Ludwig Göransson is simply apt for the movie and adds to the already tension filled environment with a penace.John David Washington and Robert Pattinson both have done some extraordinary work both mentally and physically doing their own stunts and whatnot.I promise you this, you haven't seen anything like this before even if Don't understand everything at once 😂.

Unfortunately it suffers some serious flaws. 1. The dialogue is written, delivered and recorded/mixed in a frustratingly unclear way. Every line is said in a mumbled low key monotone as if even the character doesn't really care. The lines they do say are mostly half constructed sentences as if the audience and characters already know what is going on (definitely not the case). 2. There is zero time establishing any of the characters which leads to them not feeling like real people at all, and consequently very hard for an audience to become invested in, let alone relate to.Granted, by the time you are an hour into this 2hr 30min flick you have a couple of the puzzle pieces as they at least stay with the same people and location for more than five minutes, but it's hard work that not many viewers will endure.All in all, does not feel like the director or writers know much about story telling.",Tenet

It's definitely passable entertainment.But its director is really, really sly, and being such he managed to convince a lot of people (and especially a lot of critics) out there that he created a very profound and complicated movie, when in fact he did not. 'Cause ""Tenet"" is pretty much a Bond movie going backwards half of the time. The plot is really that simple and predictable - half an hour into it and you'd already grasp pretty much everything there is to grasp. I'm not being arrogant here, please believe me: go watch the movie and you'll realize that yourself. Guaranteed. Now that we have put that aside, I'll go on by laying everything out plain and simple:PROS:Great direction. That's a given: Nolan knows how to put the camera to best use and knows how to keep you hooked most of the time;
Effective soundtrack. It's not by any chance memorable, but it nonetheless contributes a lot to the movie's overall atmosphere;
Dark cinematography. Again, very effective and in line with the movie' ""serious"" tone;
A couple of great action sequences. And the ""backwards special effects"" are really a treat to behold.CONS:Mediocre dialogues and screenplay. I mean, a lot of times the dialogues are either cringeworthy or purely explanatory (and the bad guy has the worst lines of them all). On top of that, the screenplay tries the best to conceal its simple narrative, but can't quite manage to convince you that it's phenomenal and brilliant, or that in the end it's isn't just a matter of a banal spy story. And - by the way - the overall theme is too close to blatant fatalism for me to like.Cardboard characters. Every single one of them is a total ""spy movie"" cliché: from the ""Protagonist"" to the ridiculous villain. They're completely underdeveloped and so there's no chance that the viewers can indentify with them.Unconvincing main actor. Of course he's isn't on par with his father Denzel - but that's obvious. The problem is that he also isn't on par neither with Pattison nor especially with Branagh. Really a bad casting choice over here.Lack of pathos. You're not gonna feel any empathy towards the characters ('cause, as I said, they're not actually characters: they are puppets, cardboard puppets with no interesting personalities). Nolan himself doesn't seem to care about that, lost as he is in his ""entropy gimmick"".",Tenet

And it becomes a bit tedious to watch the long forward/backwards time/entropy scenes.

4545,lidguy,A bit disappointing but worth the watch,7,18 October 2021,"Tenet is visually stunning, and the time inversion scenes are incredibly well done. Beyond that, the film ranges from decent to borderline bad. It's confusing and difficult to follow, but not in the way you'd expect. The time inversion stuff is pretty straight forward. It might have you scratching your head for a minute here and there, but if you can, as one character says, ""stop thinking linearly,"" it becomes clear. What's confusing is the overarching plot outside of this. Half the time I couldn't make out what the characters were saying, and the other half they were speaking in riddles. After reading the synopsis afterward and going back to key scenes with subtitles on, I gained a little more respect for the plot, though it still has its problems. The big, central threat falls apart if you think about it too much, and there are a couple deus ex machinas that seem incredibly unnecessary for a film that can just blame everything on time travel (sorry, inversion). Clunky dialogue and pacing issues don't do it any favors either. If this is your first go around, please turn the subtitles on - watching this in a theater would have been a rough time.My other big gripe is that, aside from the sci-fi concepts and visuals, Tenet is missing all of the other aspects one would expect from a movie like this, especially one done by Christopher Nolan. There are no moral qualms or ethical questions that characters must face, and the characters themselves are almost entirely devoid of emotion or personal motivation. This is true of the unnamed, Bond-esque protagonist, whose get-the-job-done-with-a-conscience character type is firmly established in the opening minutes. For the protagonist, this kind of character works, and John David Washington does a fantastic job of it. But if the hero won't carry the emotional weight, that job needs to fall to someone else. Most would choose the antagonist, Branagh, but his character is even more one-note and often feels like a caricature of a villain. Instead Nolan chooses the antagonist's wife, played by Debicki, who at best feels unnecessary and at worst is a burden to the plot. As the emotional core she falls incredibly flat. Pattison was surprisingly good in his role, though his character is pretty much a British version of Washington's.Tenet is a cool movie with some fantastic action to it, and taken alone it's a good-but-not-great type of film. But Nolan, whether you're a fan or not, has established himself as a higher caliber filmmaker than this movie would suggest, and compared to his other films I'd say it's pretty bad. Inception is a good comparison; it tackles an equally out-there sci-fi concept which it also uses to its advantage in crafting stunning visual sequences. But Inception keeps it going from there, giving multiple characters motivations, emotions, and philosophical dilemmas to face. Tenet seems to forget that, while these concepts might not be the biggest draw, they are just as important in crafting a quality story.",Tenet
4546,partypishposh,A brilliantly crafted espionage time-traveling film!,10,23 October 2021,"Wow! Just WOW! Tenet is the best espionage, sci-fi film that I have watched throughout the past years. The cast all act in a way that their director, Christopher Nolan, would have wanted. Sure, the plot could be complex but that doesn't take away the entertainment that this beautifully crafted film gave us. Tenet is trying to give the audience something new, and I sincerely adore that, BUT some people might not agree with the experimentation that Christopher Nolan is trying to do. But like I said, it's still entertaining, no matter how complex the plot is and how dull and boring the Protagonist (John David Washington) acts, it still is a movie that is nonetheless, an entertaining espionage.THE MIND-BLOWING COMPLEX PLOT - (10/10)
The plot in Tenet is something that is incredibly unique and different from other sci-fi espionage. From inverted bullets to running up buildings, no one can deny that the plot and idea Nolan has gave us is far more complex than Interstellar (2014) and Inception (2010). But some people might not like the confusion that Nolan's latest movie, Tenet, has brought to the audience which is completely understandable to those who adore Tenet in a way which confusion is an advantage. I absolutely love Tenet's complex plot, no matter how confusing and mind-bending it could be. To conclude my thoughts on Tenet's plot, I'd say that it is complex, confusing & different, but in a good way which could lead people into a different entertainment experience, understandable plot (if watched more than 1 time) but most importantly, it could lead people's mind into thinking that this movie, that's hated by a lot of people and critics, is a masterpiece.CAST - (8/10)
John David Washington was brilliant but a little dull on the main part of acting, facial expressions. I see what Nolan was trying to do here, by casting JDW. He's trying to make JDW be known by the people and to help him succeed in an acting career just like how his father did (Denzel Washington). Unfortunately, due to the bad reviews by critics and fans, John David Washington is considered a lazy casting.But Edward Cullen (A. K. A. Robert Pattinson) was far more likable and far more exceptional than the Protagonist himself. Robert Pattinson was dashing and his role for Neil, was an acting phenomenon. From the introduction of Neil towards the end of a beautiful friendship, his dialogue and physical acting was done brilliantly.Elizabeth Debicki was also a good casting and a good actress. She is the cream on the cake in Christopher Nolan's TENET. You could see the depression and despair in Debicki's eyes when ever she encounters Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh) and if you could notice, you know it's a good performance.Speaking of Kenneth Branagh, he's a one-of-a-kind villain in Tenet. He is your typical British boomer that was tasked to give a thick Russian accent and I was convinced that he was an actual Russian boomer. You could see in Kenneth's acting that he was made for the role of Andrei Sator. From his eyes to legs, his entire body was acting for a role that was deeply cruel. Since Debicki and Branagh are an estranged couple in Tenet, the connection between them was brilliant. Branagh's cold & abusive behavior and Debicki's sad, miserable acting was a perfectly brewed chemical in Nolan's work.PRODUCTION AND VISUAL EFFECTS - (10/10)
Personally for me, the production that was being done to create this one-of-a-kind film was exquisite. The filming process and cinematography was all just perfect for me. And Hoyte van Voytema was EXCEPTIONAL! His work on Tenet was beautiful, from landscapes of Oslo to Tallinn was absolutely gorgeous. The iMAX camera brought a huge and expensive experience in which audiences can connect with the film in such a beautiful & amazing setting.The visual effects were something else in Tenet! The building explosion during the 'Stalsk-12 War' and the plane crash in Oslo brilliantly made and was amazing! And the cinematic shots in Tenet were practical and undeniably impressive. Thanks to the VFX artists Andrew Jackson, David Lee, Andrew Lockley and Scott Fisher, their visual work on Tenet won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.SOUNDTRACK - (10/10)
One word to describe the soundtrack in Tenet, PERFECT. It really suits with the experience of a complex film. My favorite piece from Oscar winner Ludwig Göransson was the Freeport scene in Tenet, that just blew my ears and made my experience when watching Tenet even better!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
Tenet is an underrated, mind-bending, time-traveling, epic sci-fi MASTERPIECE that needs a second viewing (or more) to fully understand and compliment the complex plot and acting. I sincerely believe that this movie is one of Nolan's finest wine.",Tenet

4550,ryanbochorsky,Over-complicated and Lifeless Blockbuster,6,22 August 2020,"First of all, this movie was overly complex and too complicated. I've seen every Nolan film and loved them all, but this was by far his worst. It was clearly made to be digested more than once, but if I'm going to do that, I usually have to enjoy it the first time around. There are important plot points that are explained only once, and sometimes with the dialogue drowned out by the music and lost in the mix.It starts off with an action sequence, which is a problem for me right away. How am I supposed to feel a sense of danger for these people, before I am even emotionally invested in any characters? And it doesn't get any better. There is no character development or arcs to speak of. The film is just a series of action sequences and dialogue interactions, with very little emotion or drama. It's hard to care about a couple of guys trying to save the world, when the film's world is so void of life and feeling.The whole premise of the film is just an excuse for some trippy action sequences, like Inception. While they were very cool and well executed, the problems were being constantly confused with why they were doing what they were doing, and why I should care.The music was amazing, as always (despite not working with Hans Zimmer this time), but obviously not enough to save an over-complicated and lifeless screenplay. I really appreciate Christopher Nolan, and the fact that he has the ability to make such high budget blockbusters for the thinking person, but I did not enjoy the ride, and I came so close to giving up on it and walking out.",Tenet

If could have been another brilliant movie by Christopher Nolan. It WOULD have been another brilliant movie by Christopher Nolan. IF WE COULD HEAR IT. Literally 80 percent (or more?) of the dialog in this movie is completely unintelligible due to the sound mix. Nolan says it's intentional and that he wants to immerse the audience in the experience. The only thing he immersed me in was utter frustration.Interstellar had a little of this going on. Dunkirk a little more. It's culminated in the exercise in directorial malpractice that is Tenet. Don't get me wrong -- I love Chris Nolan's work and WANTED to like this movie. But with truly terrible sound mix, it's a complete waste of time. I realize Nolan has Final Cut, but Warner Brothers should re-release this movie with a proper sound mix and let the movie make the billion dollars or so at the box office it deserves.

Main character is portrayed by the worst actor I ever seen: dull, inexpressive, barely understood when speaking, lack of tone... you can't buy it.

4553,afrikanese,Prepare to stretch your understanding of reality,10,14 September 2020,"This movie is a masterpiece wrapped in an enigma of physics. Nolan uses ""time"" as a plot device (as he loves to do in his movies) in a way that has never been done before on the big screen before. If you like puzzles, you'll love unpacking the storyline of Tenet.Now I have to admit, the plot IS confusing. But how could it not be when events are unfolding backwards and forwards at the same time in the same space. But this is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant. Nolan's ability to take alternating directions of time and weave them together in a way that they interact with each other to drive the story forward is nothing short of genius. If you are confused by the end of the movie, watch an explanation video on YouTube. Then watch the movie again and you'll appreciate just how complex and masterful this movie really is.Simply some of the most fun I've had watching a movie in years.

Pattinson is amazing in this ""sidekick"" role, but he is so much more than that after the movie wraps up.John David Washington is great as the lead. The movie starts slowly with a lot being said/explained to keep you invested and the exposition is required. It moves fluidly right up to the half way point where things get tricky and start to get confusing. By the end of the film, it wraps up some loose ends but still leaves you a little flabbergasted. A second watch is necessary to explain little things you miss in the first viewing and it increases the film's rewatchability.Overall it is an entertaining picture. It's loud, fast, interesting and the cinematography and pace is great. There are a couple spots where dialogue is difficult to hear and understand but you do understand what the character is doing and why they are doing it.There are two scenes that completely blew me away, scenes that I've never seen before in a movie which, for the small amount of movie buffs who WANT to see things they've never seen before, add a little extra to the final product.

4566,ZanZo,A Great Spy Film Held Back By Sound Mixing,8,30 August 2020,"More often than not, I am on the edge of my seat when watching a Nolan film for the first time. His creativity in filmmaking is awe-inspiring. I absolutely loved The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. The Prestige was great, I had minor issues with Interstellar, and I quite enjoyed Memento and Insomnia. Dunkirk was a great experience for a war film (particularly in IMAX), but as a narrative film, I would not revisit the film again. While Tenet is a great film in it's own right, it was not the second coming of Inception (a 10/10 for me) that I was hoping for after the vibe I got from the trailers. The film also did not have me on the edge of my seat.Nolan's greatest films pull you into the heart and soul of its characters. Apart from Elizabeth Debicki's character (and I suppose Branagh's), I felt the other characters were going through the motions and you did not truly know who they were or what motivated them except for their duty to ""prevent World War 3"". Perhaps given that this is a spy film, the lack of knowledge about certain characters is part of their schtick.The concept of 'time inversion' employed in Tenet was great, and the set pieces of forward-time individuals battling reverse-time individuals were a real treat considering what Nolan accomplished using practical effects. On the other hand, if you're well versed in time travel stories, you may find that Tenet is predictable at times as the same clichés pop up. In that regard, I felt the stakes did not feel as high or as intense (compared to the finales of TDK trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, and The Prestige), particularly when they add the concept of antimatter annihilation and don't fully explore its potential.I found the film mostly easy to follow, as the background music or sound effects are VERY loud at times, making key dialogue difficult to understand. I had to look up plot points online afterwards only because I could not fully hear what was being discussed. You would think they would have handled dialogue better after the tweaking they did with Bane or in Dunkirk.Overall, the cast and Nolan did a great job. The concept of time inversion was cool and I was not left with burning questions at the end as I was with Inception or Interstellar. For me, this film is at most an 8/10, but it deserves to be seen.",Tenet

4573,vbojan-1,Nolan out-Nolan'ed,7,26 March 2021,"Let me start by saying that I am a devout Chris Nolan follower. I love the challenge of cracking mind-twisters, and you are guaranteed at least a few in Nolan's movies.I boldly started watching Tenet w/o any preparation, and was completely lost 50min into the movie.Part of the problem is by far the most convoluted and complex story Nolan has ever tried telling on the big screen, IMHO. As one soon finds out, the main characters travel with ease both forward and backward in time, and moreover they can spawn anew in any timeline they choose. There are thus at least a dozen of scenes where at least one of the protagonists (not necessarily TheProtagonist) are merely a forward or backward ""thread"" spawned by their consciousness. The most accessible way to observe and understand this is the airport scene: take 1 (forward) and especially take 2 (backward) but those happen nearly half-way through the movie and by this time some viewers may become desparate.I do want to single out the unnecessary nuances making this movie that much more difficult to comprehend and enjoy:
* terrible sound mixing throughout the movie literally necessitates subtitles. And then reading subtitles together with everything else going on certainly contributes to the difficulty of ""latching"" on to the story.* plethora of dialogue and entire scenes inserted in the movie w/o any agenda; rather not CONTRIBUTING to story-telling but rather distracting from it.* (related) the important clues and moments sort of blend with insignificant scenes and are given equal amount of attention.* Even after watching the entire movie, and having the benefit of hindsight there are at least 2-3 events or consequences which remain hard to comprehend (or possibly don't make complete sense).Long story short, the only way I was able to stay with the movie after the initial 50min was to read one of quite a few online explanation posts. (1-2 such great posts are in fact reviews on this forum.) I was lucky to read one with very few spoilers, and consequently the second day of watching was far more enjoyable. Overall - were it not for the few issues I outlined above my rating would be 9/10.May this review serve as a warning for some and perhaps a glimmer of hope for the others.",Tenet
4574,nutsofthemutt,Reverse Gear,4,3 September 2020,"To say I despised this film intensely is to be a master of understatement, something Nolan will never be accused of. Full of one dimensional characters I mostly wished would soon drop dead, infuriatingly inaudible mumbled dialogue drowned out by excessive background noise and a ridiculously convoluted plot posing as intellectual that you soon stop bothering trying to understand, it quickly comes across as nothing more than a series of grandiose special effects set pieces vaguely strung together by some recurring characters. Throughout the film, the nameless lead 'Protagonist' concerns himself more with the fate of one bland gangster's moll, and her barely seen but continuously and tediously referred to son, than his primary mission, which is only the fate of all mankind after all. I just wished they would die, quickly, hopefully with the same laughable speed with which our man unblinkingly accepts the breaking of laws of nature central to the plot, namely that time can be inverted, so he could get on with saving the world.The film is not without it moments and some of the aforementioned set pieces are visually stunning, the backwards/forwards fight sequences are rather mindbending although I found the novelty wore off quickly, but without characters one felt invested in or clear oration in any of the conversations that were presumably meant to explain what the hell was going on, it just starts to irritate rather than intrigue or excite. It is hard not to feel that the dialogue isn't wilfully inaudible, such a variety of devices are employed to obscure it. For example the usually most articulate Michael Caine, presumably delivering his lines far too clearly in rehearsals, is made to converse whilst chewing his food. His dialogue is still some of the clearest in the film. Perhaps the script was deemed so nonsensical that Nolan decided it was best unheard so contrived through thick foreign accents, oxygen masks, walkie talkie distortion and half dead whispering to make it indecipherable. The question constantly in my mind throughout the film was not 'what will happen next?' but instead 'what did they just say?'Before the film's big finale sequence the troops are given a mission briefing. From the ensuing mayhem one can only imagine that the soldiers could make no more sense of the plan than the audience watching the film (one member of which snored through the last half hour when I saw it, much to my envy.) For those familiar with Peter Greenaway, I found the game of 'cricket' played in Drowning by Numbers far more easily comprehensible, and that's a load of deliberate nonsense.After the dog's dinner that was Inception it seemed that Nolan had learnt a valuable lesson when it came to the making of the sublime follow up Interstellar, namely that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Whichever way you read it, Tenet is at least two steps backwards.",Tenet

4577,Gustavgi,Christopher Nolan's Matrix Reloaded,7,11 September 2020,"I remember people complaining that Matrix Reloaded was too over the top, too loud, too ""complicated"" for its own good while not neccessarily intelligent, where the creators wanted too stretch concepts found in their earlier movie(s) to some extreme. I kind of feel the same way about Tenet after having watched it the first time. The introduction of the concept of inverted objects had novelty to it, but was way too underused later in the movie and played more of a gimmicky role at times, replaced by the focus on inverted persons and time travel concepts, time loops and paradoxes already dealt with in plenty of movies such as 12 Monkeys and even Harry Potter. One of my major concerns was also that I never really picked up on the character's motives, which means that the character development felt lacking. Some choices made by the characters made me think of the old scary movie cliche of the victim walking around asking out if someone is there, instead of just being rational.. But my main concern about the movie is that if you try to decribe the plot in a few sentences you realise how unsatisfying the overarching story is. If you do the same with any other Nolan movie, you can easily describe an intriguing story. The movie is still an experience though, and I believe that I will appreciate it a bit more after the second viewing. I just feel that it had so much more potential, being Nolan and all.",Tenet

This is definitely a film that demands your attention, and is probably not intended for those that just want to be entertained without being mentally engaged throughout the film.

-Rewatching value high
-Great topic with friends or strangers on twitter
-Largely delivers for a summer flickCons:
-A bit hollow and superficial in spirit, end of world? Yeah right😏 I am more curious as to how it actually would happen, SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't (oh darn, did I ruin it for ya?)-Paper-thin characters, the only emotional stake is, you guessed it, damsel in distress, and awww, a child who may die (SPOILER ALERT, children are just concepts in Nolanland, he has trouble showing their faces either in close-ups or for more than 0.5 sec, but he likes to use them as props).-Overwhelming soundtrack, loud throughout, so much so I treated it as a foreign film with no subtitles, which clearly degraded my cognitive capacity. I felt like missing all the nuances and Easter eggs, to the point, for the first time in my life, I felt stupid watching the last 2/3 of the movie because I lost track of all dialogues and the who, where, why, when of most of it.-While novel, the main concept is ludicrous and was not portrayed consistently. If you envision what happens with our digestive system, you know the primary physiological functions of our lives, in his timelines, the concept falls apart. Eww! Quote ""you are not shooting it, you are catching it"".As you can see, I had fun picking it apart just as I had fun with its innovations.

4586,adrianpinsent,Labyrinthine beyond necessity.,6,13 March 2021,"Ok.... So made a lot more sense the second time, but it's still enigmatic beyond what it needs to be. I don't believe a film should be this complex by design.
The film fails.
It's not a nuanced and complex narrative that makes one think, ""Yeah, I want to see that again, in case I missed something"" or ""I wanna watch that a second time to see if it holds up"" like the Sixth Sense or Fight Club or Vertigo. It's not in the realms of ""Wow. That was amazing. Perhaps I missed something."" It's, ""Wow. That was visually amazing, but I generally had no clue what it was about without approaching half a dozen viewings.""
This is a film that on initial watching leaves the viewer with an almost universal absence of comprehension as to what the narrative was. That's not a good thing. It will be talked about and studied by student film makers and the likes of us for decades as a body of work by a near genius film maker....but....on a base level as a film, it fails in that it is practically incomprehensible on first viewing. If your audience doesn't leave with a feeling that they understand what they have just viewed, something is wrong. You will alienate the audience and potentially lose those who want to have a second watch, because it basically disappears up its own labyrinthine backside. I had no problem with Inception, Momento, Interstellar, or The Prestige. They all left me with a couple of unaswered questions that a second watch completely cleared up, (or at least left me with a philosophical debate, based on perspectives of one's own interpretation of the material and nuances, unanswerable, but thought provoking and deliberately so, to promote that debate)
The second watch of Tenet still left me thinking, ""Yeah ok. I think I get this, but I am still not sure.""

4588,sethward,Do not watch without subtitles,2,4 September 2020,"It's normal to need to watch Nolan's films multiple times to appreciate the layers and sometimes to fully understand what's going on.This time though it'll take three or four watches just to understand the dialogue.With Tenet, he's turned up the levels for his renowned 'BWOOOOOOOOOOM' bass lines to a Spinal Tap 11. The cinema shakes. Meanwhile not only is the sound mix dropping the speech to about half what it needs to be while that's going on, but Branagh is actually angrily whispering.Cinema can transport you into the life of another human being. If you watch Tenet you'll be transported into the life of someone who's hard of hearing and suffering general confusion due to mental decline.It's much worse if you watch on a screen with a powerful sound system. So contrary to the usual advice, do not watch this film on IMAX. Try to find the weakest, tinniest sound system in town. Even better, wait until it's online with subtitles.My favourite part? About 90 minutes in, one of the characters sparks in Russian. Nolan helpfully adds subtitles. I found myself hoping much of the rest of the film would be in Russian. I was disappointed.SPOILER ALERT...
There's another issue with the central conceit.You'll have a nagging feeling throughout about this but might find it hard to pinpoint.But of you think about it you'll realise that you never really see the consequence of actions made in reverse.If someone going backwards through time shoots a helicopter out of the sky, for example.. in the 'normal' forward timeline, this would mean the characters in that helicopter starting off dead (or frozen) on the ground, before being sucked back up into the sky in flames in a reverse explosion (not sure this would actually be an implosion), and then going about their day. They start off dead then come back to life. How do you start your day off dead? What were you doing before that?Anyway this isn't a deal breaker.. I guess it could be counted as the one conceit you forgive a film.But overall it's a huge shame that the film is almost a parody of the Nolan fingerprint, particularly the sound mix and overblown score. Otherwise it's got lots of typically smart ideas.",Tenet

4591,krbrown_1,I wish I had more thumbs to 'thumbs up' Tenet,10,17 January 2021,"Yes, the movie was confusing (and frequently challenging to hear the dialogue), but I don't feel that it was a fault. In fact, I think there were dozens (hundreds?) of intentional elements in the film that are only recognizable long after the film ends and well into post-viewing disection. I loved that I spent almost an entire hour post-viewing talking about the film, trying to find holes in character timelines, and then having my mind blown every time that we realized how the pieces fell into place. But, this is a movie that begs for dissection, and if you don't have a partner in crime to view it with then you may be left wondering, ""WTF?"" I watched this last night, and had to stop the film several times to ask questions/discuss with my viewing buddy (he's much more well-versed in movies with time-travel and/or sci-fi esque motifs). He was catching on to a myriad of tropes immediately while I was completely lost. However, I was never upset by my confusion or felt that it was the film's fault. There was a LOT of meat in this film, and I thought it was executed perfectly (except the ""romance"" element). Most of Kat's character buildig sequences were superfluous and I had zero connection to her love for her son. Movie could have been truncated and enhanced by avoiding such statements as, ""Even my son???"" after Kat is informed that all of earth including the human species will be destroyed. Yes, Kat, this does include your son.
There were extremely well executed opening action sequences that were, clearly, a beast to orchestrate. The characters were insanely well cast, and I want to watch everything that John David Washington is in. He was rad. Period. Oh, and funny. Robert Pattinson was fabulous. The bad guy was deplorable, but he wasn't the usual contrived Hollywood deplorable with poor dialogue and unfathomable behavior. He was believable, and well-acted.

It literally is an excellent Nolan take on espionage and to be fair look at bond we knew very little about him until Skyfall because you really don't need too it's not the point of these type of movies. How can some people say the women parts of his films are insignificant and others say that Debeckis performance is outstanding for example. How can some people call it humourless when others quite clearly see humorous parts to this movie. Yes it's big Yes it's loud (I thought the score was among Nolan's best movie scores Zimmer or not) Yes it's complicated but if that is the point of this movie how is that a failure? Also big up Robert Pattison an actor who is really going places by the way. I for one am going back to the cinema for another watch. I for one enjoy how Nolan can make an original take on so many different genre of movie and still keep me entertained. All his movies are so different but so good for it. As much as inception is one of the best movies of all time I don't want to go see that every time he makes a movie and I'm glad he is willing to always try something totally different and believe that's how all his films should be judged not by comparing it to his amazing back catalogue. Tenet is awesome if you go into it expecting it to be as someone aptly said ""BOND ON ACID"". Nolan is THE director of big budget cinema that we need!!! We all complain we have seen it all before.

I didn't even mention anything I saw on the movie screen yet. High expectations paired with a huge budget and one of the biggest directors of these days made me at least hope for a solid movie.The reasons why this movie is so horribly bad are many. If I would make a list of every catagory a movie could gain points, I wouldn't know how to award _Tenet_ any. Did I like the actors? Not really. Did I care for the characters? No. Was it a thrilling ride? No. Did I like the film settings? No, it was rather depressing, dark, lifeless, claustrophobic. Did I understand the dialogues? Parts of them but the language barrier wasn't the only reason not getting all the necessary information.What about the score music? Not impressive at all. The action? I lost my interest for the movie after 30 minutes or so. Then _Tenet_ just gave me the same frustrated feeling as watching _Transformers 2_ in cinema - I just was staring at the screen, watching absoutely soulless and confusing non-stop action while just feeling dazed and hoping that the 2 1/2 hours would be over soon. And not to mention the confusing plot itself. _Inception_ was a nice cinema experience and I received it as a solid actioner with cool elements/effects (which doesn't replace a good script but Hollywood is ignoring this aspect constantly), interesting actors/characters. _Tenet_ is so far from all that. The main target could've made an exciting movie. But the movie's world was rather small or limited. I come to think of _Twelve Monkeys_. Which is better in every way.

4604,rawatamol,Deep explanation,9,9 December 2020,"Spoilers!!
When i watched interstellar, I thought nothing can beat this but Sir. Nolan break the barrier of my expectation by making tenet. I mean how he create the relationship between thermodynamics and time is mind blowing. There is three principle work simultaneously with each other in this movie.
time inversion.
grandfather paradox.
Maxwell demon law.
Time inversion basically to change the entropy of an object which is impossible theoretically . It is Because it violate the second law of thermodynamics. Here again i want to show that everything has its advantage and disadvantages its up tp you which one you choose. reverse entropy can be use to reduce the greenhouse effect but instead people use it for the devastation in this movie. Sir Nolan try to give message we need to save our planet for our future gen but in complex manner.
Second thing here is grandfather paradox theory shown in this movie again it is controversial topic of quantum physics. Sir Nolan leave this topic on us. Future gen. try to destroy the past. but they also don't know the consequence of this. People who don't know grandfather paradox. It is theory in which you killed your ancestor but you will survive or not in future. No detail ...as I say it is debatable principle. But in movie because of past events, future gen. lose everything in future . they forced to take this step without know the future.
Third one is Maxwell demon law , It is funny to say that it violate the second law of thermodynamics but it exist in this movie. Two chambers red and blue represent the isolate system where things changing in molecular level. I don't want to in depth because its kind of feel weird.
What is really disappoint me, The IMDB rating of this movie it moves from 8 to 7.7. This is unacceptable. If you don't understand the movie its not movie/ director fault. You need to understand the principle behind the movie.
Some question still remains in the end of the movie and Sir. Nolan leave to the audience which is frustrated me. Anyways this will happen in every sci/fi Nolan movie.",Tenet

I saw a couple walk out, a person going to the bathroom and I personally was stuck because my friend who also disliked the film didn't want to leave. Note that due to covid, there was almost no one in the theater. I really don't understand how this can get a 7,8 rating!",Tenet

4613,planet_of_the_boonies,"So many great ideas, completely marred by inaudible dialogue",7,28 August 2020,"This is another beautiful and innovative movie from Nolan and shares themes from several of his previous works. The achievements of the writers & special effects team are completely offset by 2 major factors.Firstly the dialogue:SFX volume mix is wayyyy off. Your ears will be ringing from the brass-heavy typical Nolan soundtrack and while your hearing is being destroyed you're forced to try and listen to characters mumble-whisper the rest of the time (seriously, they may as well be wearing Bane's face mask). This already major flaw is exasperated by the fact that the film is exposition-heavy and constantly trying to explain what's going on. I really wanted to hear what these characters had to say but for the second half of the movie I just focused on trying to read lips, which didn't work either.Second is the complete lack of character development. I have to idea why The Protagonist (John David Washington) cares so much for the villian's wife & her plight, nor do I know a single shred of anything about him aside from he's basically a spy. I'm left feeling like the movie spent so much time trying to explain itself to the audience that it forgot some of the core concepts of good film. Washington's character does get a few good lines which hint at a witty personality but they are sparsely peppered throughout the movie. It would've been great to see him get more non-exposition dialogue, so we could understand who he is and form more of an attachment to him. Unfortunately the flat, one dimensional characters of the Protagonist & Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) lends more to cheesy cliché rather than Nolan masterpiece.With those flaws out of the way, the rest of the movie was good, mentally stimulating fun. The shots were beautiful and true to Nolan's form.
Although, I'd have liked to see a little less 'shakey cam' towards the end. Fight scenes were a unique experience & the action itself is worth the price of admission. Kenneth Branagh plays a convincing ""baddie"" & makes a thin motivation work. Robert Pattinson does a great job in support (as he did in Lost City of Z) and uses limited screen-time & dialogue to flesh out his character well.I definitely will watch this film again but will wait until I can at home... with the volume low... and subtitles on.",Tenet

I've never had any issues with the sound in Nolan films - their sound is immersive and sometimes very loud, but it almost always fits the scene and the dialogue can still be heard. That said, like many others I could barely understand what was said in most of this movie. Use subtitles or move on to something else. I really hope they fix the sound so I can try again.",Tenet

I still enjoyed the visual and audio treat and top quality good looking actors on show. I agree that it was hard to hear some dialogue, maybe that was intentional as normal life is hectic/noisy let alone when you're a spy in the middle of explosions, wearing a mask... etc. Having seen it a 2nd time I think it could've benefited from work on the sound, struggled to hear some bits.

No, that does not make up for the lack of good dialogue, relatable characters, or solid motivations. This movie is a pain to watch because either you have hours of exposition dialogue delivered in the most robotic, bored way, or big, jarring action sequences (some of them twice of course, in case you didn't grasp the main concept by now) where we don't really care about who wins or dies. There is so much talk in this movie and nothing really is said.The science of the movie is fun but it is presented in a disappointing way. Characters throw in concepts randomly, seeming to be very clever and then we're just left there with them. This is complexity for complexity's sake. We literally gain nothing from these conversation. I could cut out entire sequences and make this movie half as long and nothing would be lost.The characters are ridiculously robotic and emotionless. Acting is great, it's just that there is not much to act in the first place.And lastly, sound mixing is so bad one thinks it is intentional. ""Important"" conversations are actually inaudible.When an actual line in the movie is ""You don't have to understand it, you have to feel it,"" we get what this movie is about: just looking cool but being empty inside.If anyone wants to see a time travel story that is executed very well, I'd recommend ""Dark"" on Netflix.",Tenet

4630,loanea,Ahead of it's time...,10,18 September 2020,"Another masterclass by Nolan. The genius to write such a movie with so much intermingled and intertwined if baffling.
This movie has been made to watch more than once to fully understand and appreciate it. Quite bold by Nolan but keeping true to his obvious fetish for time ( interstellar, memento, inception)
There are reviews giving out about music too loud or mumbled lines but these don't even come into such a gigantic and monumental achievement. Yes it will be great to watch it with subtitles but there's parts of the movie they have to wear a mask so obviously it'll be harder to hear (as we all know in current times). The score is spine tingling and thrilling - the louder the better I say.
Some people will be put off by the mental torture of trying to deal with time moving in 2 directions but just sit back and have faith that Nolan has you covered and it'll all make sense upon further viewings.
This movie is ahead of its time and will not be fully appreciated until it gets time to be viewed and reviewed and fully absorbed and pondered.
I for one look forward to watching it again and again for years to come just like Nolan's other greats.

4636,michael_auty,What a mess,2,19 September 2020,"A great premise as ever from Nolan and with a strong opening scene I was expecting great things. Unfortunately - not to be.The film is chock full of stilted, wooden performances from everyone except Branagh. But the biggest fail of all is the audio mix: Appalling is the only word I can muster. Large parts of the film are unintelligible, compounded by the fact that the protagonists are often wearing masks. Really Nolan? Really?
If the script is good - I couldn't hear 75% of it.
We were reduced to lip reading for a majority of the performance - a strategy ruined by Nolan's ever shifting camera work.There are some very odd editing decisions, some glaring continuity errors and as a result the whole thing feels more like a set of disparate actions scenes rather than a cohesive narrative.The story isn't particularly complicated. Many of the time-travel clues are easy to spot so the twists and turns aren't difficult to decipher - in fact they're the only part of the film that's accessible. This is a shame given the fact that the narrative as a whole is difficult to follow because of the terrible audio balance.
After the furore surrounding the Bane character in the Batman soundtrack - one might have thought that Nolan would have learned his lesson? Apparently not.My over-arching feeling walking away from the cinema was ""Did Nolan even watch that before putting it out?""A great opportunity that missed the mark by a country mile.",Tenet

Lack of a proper plot where you care about any character.,1,13 December 2020,"The movie fails to make the viewer familiar with the concept during the scene where the protagonist meets the scientist. Once that fails, the viewer is just a spectator of the mayhem that is ensuing in front of him, while completely clueless. Assume you're super smart and can understand the ultra-fictional concept, even though it has lots of loopholes, there's very little to go on in terms of being vested in the plot. ""WW3"" ""Big scary nuclear weapon"" ""Scary Russian guy has something to do with it"" ""Save the wife"".

4638,henry-willis,Definitely needs multiple viewings,7,28 August 2020,"I was massively hyped to see this film on the big screen finally. As a spectacle, It was big, loud, incredibly bold and very impressive with its concepts and plot and although I really enjoyed the visuals, sound and acting, I did walk out very confused.This was partly due to the insane complexity of the film, but like Nolan's other films, you will notice a bit more each time you re-watch it so I don't have a problem with that. Inception and the Prestige particularly get better and better each time I re-watch them, and Tenet I'm sure will be the same.The other reason is my main negative with the film, the sound mixing. It is extremely difficult at times to understand what people are saying, either due to thick accents, characters talking from behind a gas mask or because there is a lot of background noise + the pounding score. For a film that is very aware that it is complex, the sound mixing could really do with enhancing the dialogue. Watching it with subtitles would really help.However, after several re-watches, I think this film will turn out to be yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, I don't think it will turn out to be his best film, but that was always going to be very hard to achieve when he has such a strong and consistent filmography. It's plot is very clever and is truly unique and original, and in a world dominated by largely boring, disposable and generic superhero films (there are a few exceptions obviously).Tenet is a breath of fresh air to the film industry which challenges the mind with its daring plot and then blows it away with its stunning visuals. The acting is top notch all round, even if the character development is a bit light, but this film is all about the plot and the experience, which it certainly delivers on. I highly recommend it, but be warned it might initially leave you with a lot of questions, so definitely go and see it at least twice to really appreciate the masterwork that is Tenet.",Tenet

It takes all the quirks of a Nolan movie to the extreme and removes all the distractions. This movie is just raw and constructed plot that will claim your full attention.Tent has a complicated plot but at the same time Nolan puts the explanation right in front of you, making the movie very obvious. It's just that those clues require context to be fully understood. This is how he invites you to watch his movies over and over again. Take The Prestige as an example where Nolan used the same technique just that in Tenet the clues are somewhat harder to notice.Personally, I think that is what cinema is made for. It is about more than just watching a movie, it is about the experience. And boy what an experience Nolan delivers with Tenet.I have seen it in cinema three times already and I am really looking forward to watch it countless more times at home.Seriously, go see it in a cinema with a big screen and do so multiple times.

Tenet is the same way. It is a great action movie with amazing choreography. An original plot that is very much in the way of Predestination, interstellar or inception. People who didn't like those movies probably don't like this one because they are confusing to people who don't have enough brain cells to enjoy being challenged by a movie. Don't listen to the idiots who are just complaining about it being loud or confusing. Guess what. Interstellar was loud too still one of the best space / time travel movies ever made.

In the movie they keep talking about temporal pincer movements... they have inverted agents experiencing events slightly in the future to give the people travelling through time normally information about what's going to happen. You can only properly understand and enjoy the film by having your past self experience it first so your future self benefits from the extra knowledge. Even down to the conversations, you have no idea when they are saying first time and a big part of that is the sound mixing, I thought it was just poorly mixed, but second time knowing what they are actually talking about you now know what they are saying, it's intentionally mixed the way it is.

I heard this was his take on a James Bond type film so if you enjoy the action of a bond movie, and complex storytelling of inception and interstellar then you will love this movie.

But believe me, you will love to watch it again...And now the good thing: The sript and direction of this film is probably the best you can get till nowadays. Nolan proves once more that he is the most highly-intelligent person in the industry today (he is the writer too as he was in Inception and Memento...).
The no-CGI effects you ll have ever seen, the film is full of cult scenes, not referring to any, not to spoil things for the non-viewers,but there are at least 5 scenes soooo unique.Surely best film of the year, and for me, surely of the decade in terms of scipt and direction.

It was slightly painful to watch as it is definitely not what I was expecting after so many perfectly executed movies from Nolan. Must admit, the bar was set pretty high,
Many people found this movie a masterpiece after watching it at least one more time. If I ever manage to do that, I might change my review, until then 4 stars is the most appropriate rating this movie should receive.",Tenet
4671,graemekear,Why make a movie like this?,5,29 August 2020,"First off, I should say that I am a fan of Nolan and that Inception, Interstellar and The Prestige are some if my favourite films.But I just don't understand the thought process behind making a film so complex that the majority of the viewers are lost? A lot of fan reviews have said 'I got it the second time I watched it', but call me a weirdo if you like but if i sit and watch a film for nearly three hours, I'd like to be entertained, not confused. I shouldn't have to watch a film twice to understand it. Repeat viewings should be for enjoyment and appreciation, not to simply 'get it'.I also think that the story telling was quite poor in places. There were several times where something random is explained, or not as the case may be, and then used in a scene straight away after and then forgotten about. Why? And if for some reason you didn't catch the little intro for the set piece, forget understanding the next bit. But don't worry, it likely won't have any effect on the film and the next one will be along in a few minutes.This film tries to fit so much in and do some many clever things that it all becomes a bit of a mishmash and to be honest, gobbledegook. There are some really good touches and little set pieces, but far too many are just thrown together with very little cohesion or explanation.I feel that if Nolan had toned down the cleverness and made a thought provoking, twisting, but understandable and enjoyable film (Inception, for example) it would be a much better film - I just don't understand how he'd watch this in the editing room and believe this is the best he can do.I'd imagine that there are a bucket load of plot holes, but the chances are you won't know if there are or not! At least until your second viewing perhaps!In summary, this could have been a really good film with an interesting and unique story. But poor story telling and a far too complex plot prevent it from being so. Shame.",Tenet

After the 2nd watch I think it's safe to say that this is the best directed film of all time, all the niches and nuances that you pick up on the second watch make the film so much more enjoyable.

The main idea of the movie is such complicated that even one of the best writers of this genere cannot avoid mistakes and break its own rules.For example. why an inverted car that is following another ordinary car is driving behind that?! And why doesn't it just use its brakes in the position to make a collision and stop that?! Or why is the exact time of death of Sator important?

Ludwig Göransson so the viewer is immersed in the scene with the character (whether it is the protagonist or Neil) ie: When Neil went to examine the Freeport as he's walking and observing the halls you can without doubt notice the music volume gets louder and louder compared to the voice of the dude who was accompanying Neil which was getting lower and lower (that inversion motive gets repeated throughout the movie in sound and picture).Obviously you will enjoy that movie by repetition, personally I enjoyed it more on the 2nd watch in IMAX, and yes the movie has an extremely fast tempo and fast montage which again is cut that way by design, Nolan wants you to get confused on 1st watch just like the protagonist character was throughout his journey, it is a genius mirroring technique in my opinion!Another genius shot was during the first act right after the Opera house prologue when they caught the protagonist and tied him to a chair, one of the antagonists held a ""Pincer"" to yank one of the teeth and at the same shot 2 trains (one going forward and another going backward on the tracks) :D :D :D a very poetic reflection of the movie's temporal pincer movement theme.I honestly believe this is one of THE best pictures Nolan has produced so far, however I don't think you will enjoy it if you are not familiar with Nolan's craftsmanship and previous work.PS: Yes, Neil is who you think he is ;) it makes perfect sense!",Tenet

Tenet, is a great movie without a doubt, and Christopher Nolan has really put a lot of thought into the script and the direction to tell this story.
Unfortunately due to so much happening at the same time, and at times things happening and re-happening in the opposite order at the same time can be overwhelming and plain and simply confusing.
Tenet is not the movie you see when you're trying to relax, its a thinking movie, a movie that you have to follow closely or you will get lost in the pictures.
The visuals are breathtaking, and if you can't follow the story just enjoy the images as if you're walking through an art gallery.

It's complicated. But unlike other films that shift the sequence of time to deliberately mind bend the viewer, the complexity comes from what is linear and how inverted time integrates, so just go with it and enjoy how the story unfolds and reveals.
If you have read any review it will tell you the main character, is only known as The Protagonist, which by definition dehumanises but should have depth. There was a line at the beginning of the film that summed it up where Michael Caine says ""You will need better than Brooks Brothers to convince"" and the middle of the road suit was an appropriate metaphor for Mr Washington's performance. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the quality the film deserved and certainly not enough to hold the film together for the duration. Irrespective of the exciting final scene and effects I was not invested in him to care if he saved the world or not.

Nolan does it again!,10,7 September 2020,"Here is my initial review which I stand behind and now that I have seen it twice I love this movie so much...""TENET"" Review: (spoiler-free)Big screen movies are officially (kind of) back and Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller ""Tenet"" is the welcome party back to the theater. Nolan, known mostly for delivering innovative and original big-budget films with a cerebral kick such as ""The Dark Knight"" ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", has once again returned to meddle with his favorite movie-making ingredient: TIME. ""Tenet"" is part spy-thriller with a James Bond like slickness combined with a brain tingling time-travel narrative. These elements are anything but conventional as the movie twists and turns with dizzying delight complete with breathtaking set pieces to rival any modern action movie. ""Tenet"" stars John David Washington (great DNA), as ""The Protagonist"" who is giving off some serious Clint Eastwood ""Man with No Name' vibes as ""The Protagonist"" never goes by any other title. Washington plays the character calmly and coolly as he brings an effortless charisma to a role that introduces us to a hidden world of modern day espionage. This hidden world in ""Tenet"", without wanting to reveal too much, is only understood by those who know objects, things, and even people can become ""inverted"" in the future. Being ""inverted"" essentially allows these objects and persons to be traveling backward in time meaning our perspective in present day comes with visualizing these ""inversions"" as backward-moving like a Michael Jackson moonwalk. Our ""Protagonist"" with the help of CIA agent friend Neil, a charming Robert Pattinson, has come to the realization that a man from the future seeks to use this ""inversion"" capability to cause a global crisis in our present time (think Bond villain scheme). Confused yet? Well no worries, for as baffling and mind-bending as the plot can be at times, you will not need to think much to understand how jaw-dropping it is to watch a car ""un-crash"" or a building ""un-explode"" (implode?) due to ""inversions"". This duality of plot confusion amongst stunning sequence after stunning sequence may have ""Tenet"" making you feel inverted and backwards. It is equal parts frustrating and fascinating leaving you perplexed throughout. The one positive takeaway for certain though is that Nolan has crafted a movie that is holistically original and unique which makes it a delight to experience. ""Tenet"" has that mind-provoking quality that will have you looking to return again for a second watch the second the screen goes to black. Personally, I feel my future self is the only one who can properly rate this movie after a solid rewatch (or two) but know that I found ""Tenet"" completely captivating despite being unnecessarily difficult and emotionless at times. ""Tenet"" is what the big screen is made for as it feels more like an experience rather than a movie. Make sure your future self also catches this one on the biggest screen possible before time runs out...Grade: A- (or do I have it backward?)",Tenet

I've enjoyed the majority of this director's output, had no issue with the casting or central premise, but the execution was bordering on the insulting. Wooden acting, stilted dialogue. Pointless set pieces, delivered without care or interest in wanting to engage the viewer. My only enjoyment was hoping that the 'baddie' got his way and ended this mess. I 'got' the point, but the point was pointless. (Spoiler) Watching a hired army (whose motivation I had no idea on) running backwards, while another bunch ran forward was comical, yawn-inducing, and dull, dull, dull. This truly was French and Saunders does Inception, without the intentional laughs. I genuinely felt that Nolan was sticking a middle finger up at points and I don't appreciate the gag. I'd prefer to watch a season of Mrs Brown's Boys. Don't pretend it is good - it is ok to dislike this but enjoy Nolan's work either side of it. Tenot.",Tenet
4723,viktorlunde,Best time travel movie so far,10,18 September 2020,"This is in my opinion the best movie made about time travel. Just as you'd expect from Nolan, the plot is complex and layered, and it employs a novel concept (or rather, mechanic) that provides great visuals and action scenes. It is a bit lacking in emotional and thematic depth, but that is not the focus of the movie. It is extremely satisfying when in the last half of the movie, the details you didn't understand until then start to make sense.",Tenet

4726,doorkicker14,A Vision of what a Movie can - and should be allowed to - be,10,17 December 2020,"Tenet pushes the boundary of just what it is we should expect from a movie. It does not provide a neat, two-hour block of passively-consumable entertainment, where one can follow a simple, linear story, feel a little thrilled, feel a little scared, and leave the theater at the end, perhaps impressed, but ultimately primed to forget the movie sooner rather than later.Tenet, on the other hand, is a movie as complex in its plot as it could feasibly be, a movie where a second viewing is enjoyable to a degree unfathomable for most other films. There's an element of enjoyment here similar to what one experiences with a movie such as Shutter Island, or Westworld's Season 1 - where the re-watching allows one to look at the unfolding story in a new light, pick up subtle hints of twists yet to be revealed, and come to appreciate the intelligent setup of a story that was not quite what it seemed to be in the beginning. But Tenet goes beyond those two examples. Whereas the joy of re-watching Shutter Island or Westworld's Season 1 center around ""being in"" on the secret of what's actually going on (or yet to happen), Tenet's enjoyment comes from a growing understanding of the plot itself, and with it the revelation of the principles governing the world of the Protagonist and of the cohesion of the plot. It is precisely this complexity - which we cannot appreciate fully at first. - which means that Tenet cannot satisfy our crave for a quick two-hour shot of entertainment before we go back to our day's business.Tenet is a movie of stunning cinematography, superb acting, and a very fitting score. One can, and most likely will, appreciate those at the first viewing. Yet, one will undoubtedly have trouble following the plot, following the logic of the characters' actions, understanding the physical principles governing the world Tenet occupies. But this is not to say this is a movie that's not thought through, is full of plot holes, or where characters make unexpected and unexplainable choices; quite the contrary. When one starts, after that initial viewing, to ponder, think, discuss, maybe read - then one may very well start 'looking at the world in a new way', not unlike the Protagonist himself as he is introduced into the treacherous and complex World Tenet occupies. And one might just start to think about the underlying mechanics of our own world outside the film, about the role of fate that Tenet conveys, and about how the laws of physics that govern our own reality are not quite as inevitable, as unavoidable, as they appear to us when we're living our daily lives.Tenet is a movie to stimulate thoughts, a movie that can't be completely understood at first viewing, yet is still immensely enjoyable even then, given the superb directing, acting, and scoring. And after some pondering, in subsequent viewing(s), one will start to appreciate a plot so complex, yet in its underlying principles so simple and thus understandable; and this cannot but add to one's overall appreciation of this film.Given that a full understanding and appreciation of Tenet can't be achieved at first sight, for some of us, Tenet challenges the conception of just what a movie must 'be like' to even be considered a good, or great, 'movie'. I can't help but expect that Tenet will go down in history as a Classic, as one of the all-time Greats, precisely because it pushed the boundaries of what a movie can be. Whoever rejects this film, rejects this intention just as much as the work itself.I, for one, contend that after confusion comes enlightenment; and this ultimate enlightenment adds a level of enjoyment to this movie that goes well beyond pure 'entertainment', if one is willing to stick around rather than call it quits immediately after a first viewing. Few movies in history have been able to be enjoyable on as many levels as Tenet is.I won't be forgetting Tenet anytime soon. And that, to me, indicates that Tenet is filmmaking at its best.",Tenet

It felt forced, JD Washington was not who I would imagine to be the lead character. His demeanor was too ""gangster"", he was too focused on being cool and smooth, where I felt like the character needed more emotional arc and vulnerability. There were clearly moments in the movie where I saw doubt in his eyes, and it took me out of the movie. I LOVED the antagonist Sator, he was pure menace; perfect casting, perfect acting. On the other hand, JD was only 80% there, he was flat the whole time. There was no arc, no growth, barely any emotions. To be in a Christopher Nolan movie, you should be bringing 110% to the role. JD didn't bring that, he was adequate at best, he did not transcend the role. Maybe Denzel would have, but not JD. It is still a magnificent movie as Nolan can do no wrong, the action and physical aspects were respectable, but I cant help but wonder if it would've been even better had it been a different lead actor.",Tenet
4736,thedarkknight_332,Christopher Nolan has made another great movie (shocker!) (Non-spoiler review),8,19 September 2020,"So how best to describe this movie? Imagine Christopher Nolan directing James Bond but.....with time travel incorporated into the mix. Have seen plenty of reviews online claiming that this is a very complex film. One that is very hard to comprehend in its entirety in a single viewing. That couldn't be further from the truth and I don't know what has happened to our critics. This is one of Nolan's more simpler films. There is a ton of exposition dedicated to explaining the specifics of time inversion, the predestination theory of time travel etc. I won't go into the details as that would venture into spoiler territory but the movie basically spoon feeds the audience and to be honest, at times it was too on the nose for me. Critics will find movies like Endgame perfect which had multiple contradictions during the course of its own narrative. No wonder that Scorsese thinks we're killing cinema.Onto the action in this film. There was this misconception in the online film sphere that Nolan is 'bad' with action scenes. Folks who believed that will have to eat up their words as this film has some of the best action scenes that i've seen in some time. The visuals and the stunts are breathtaking and to think that Nolan achieved with no CG. I know Nolan doesn't like to give away BTS footage but I hope he makes an exception for this film. I'm dying to see how they achieved this in camera with no green screens. As with most Nolan movies, the score is once again a strong aspect which enhances the viewing experience. For the longest time, I thought Hans Zimmer was the composer and you'd be forgiven if you're still under that impression but apparently, Zimmer was busy with another film and Ludwig Goransson replaced him and he has done an excellent job.To close it off, I'd like to discuss some of the negatives. This movie has paper thin characters like they're almost non existent. I know bloggers are using this to fuel this narrative that this is Nolan's achilles' heel and that he's 'bad' with character work. These people are really bad with memory. This is the same director who reinvented Batman for a generation by making you care about Bruce and Batman simultaneously. Something that was unprecedented at the time. His character work has always been one of his core strengths. I cared about Dom Cobb in Inception and I cared about the Cooper family in Interstellar. These are beautifully fleshed out characters. Dunkirk was always going to be a plot heavy film but I really wanted more with the characters in this particular film. Nothing wrong with the performances though. All of them were awesome. Loved the chemistry between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson.The weak character work is the only thing holding me back from giving this film a perfect score. With stronger character work, this would've been an all time classic.",Tenet

It's not even Hans Zimmer this time - here the great Ludwig Göransson (Black Panther, The Mandalorian) is on scoring duties, making it all his own (you will nod your head intensely) but without ever scrimping on the blams.

This would surely require someone to predict the future, spray the scene with bullets, so they can 'catch' them with the gun.

strong acting from everyone although Washington feels a little bland. I really loved Brennagh (terrifying!) and Pattinson (charming)Production value and design is world classCinematography is very strong although not my cup of teaPractical and visual effects are top notch. None of the effects will take you out of the movie, everything looks very realBAD:
Soundtrack & Sound-Mixing: the score is very boring and monotonous. Besides the theme song (which is played only briefly) it is just EXTREMELY loud and annoying. In addition, it is very difficult to understand the actors as they speak very fast and mumble often.Length: the movie is just too long for what it's trying to do. The concept of time inversion is interesting as an idea but not exciting to watch for 2 h 30 minPlot: without the time inversion its actually a very stereo typical bad guy wants to destroy the world plot because he is upset. the time inversion idea is a neat gimmick but doesn't work nearly as well as Nolans 'time concepts' as seen in Dunkirk, Inception or Memento.Dialogue: its often trying to hard to be smart and it takes itself too seriously.
Character development: almost non existent. We have almost no emotional connection to the protagonists of the movie besides maybe Elizabeth, but I didn't really care that much eitherI'm giving it a 6 out of 10 because it is a movie worth watching but it is has too many major flaws in terms of plot, sound, editing and character development too be considered very good.",Tenet

Nolan made with Tenet his first major flaw and you can say anything you want about this movie but it pretends a lot but is nothing.The first major problem I have with this movie is the casting and level of acting.
The protagonist plays this 2-D character with unrealistic conversations like they come directly out of a Gilmore Girls. The second casting flaw is the Antagonist which is a Irish actor with a bad Russian accent, come you can come with something better than the Russian cliche (with bad accent).Second major problem is the chemistry between the actors and characters. Washington has to save to world from some kind of apocalypse (boring) but is mostly busy with saving Debicki but why is the question since there seems to be no deeper connection between the two characters.Third problem I had was the fact that Debicki keeps talking about how she does not want to lose here child with who the viewer had no connection since the son has no lines in the whole movie and is maybe 5 minutes in the film, this irritated me the whole movie.The plot of the movie is typically Nolan style but with the movies flaws it just does not work out good this time.Nolan has the same problem as Burton had several years ago, he has his style and made some great movies (Memento!!) but does the same trick again and with the bad casting and writing this movie is only some nice shots and a great musical soundtrack.",Tenet

4756,ricardonick,This is why Nolan is the only director in Hollywood to have big budgets with original ideas,8,9 September 2020,"Once again, Christopher Nolan proved why he is the only director in Hollywood to have big budgets with original ideas.
TENETis about using reversing time to prevent a possible war. It is reversing time, not time travel. The characters don't go back in time like we are used to in other movies, like Endgame or Back to the Future. Instead of that, in this universe exists moments where time flows forward and the other moments where the time goes backward, this means that the things we see happen in reverse motion. This is an incredibly confusing, mindblowing, and very though concept to create. An idea that only Nolan could creat and make a great film about it
I'm not gonna lie, this is a confusing movie, and a lot of people are going the leave the cinema very confused. But, this is an original Christopher Nolan movie, what else are you expecting? With this man, we are going to have an experience that is gonna makes us think and scratch our heads about what we just saw. if you don't like this kind of stuff and prefer a by the rules movies, TENET isn't for you. But if you are a Nolan fan (like myself), Tenet is not going to leave disappointed.
Just like Inception, TENET needs to be seen multiple times to truly understand the story and the concept. This isn't a bad thing by any means, it's actually what makes Nolan´s movies so good.

4759,broadley-658-659134,Confusing and hollow,3,29 August 2020,"On paper, Tenet should have been as good as Interstellar and Inception. There are definitely similarities between these Nolan films - which in itself is not a bad thing as you know you're in for a challenging interesting and visually amazing experience. But there are 3 differences between Tenet and those films:
1. The cast and performances in Tenet are weak, and you just don't care about any of them. Washington's character just wasn't interesting and was pretty boring. Basic film making = make characters you can care about.
2. The dialogue is fast and quiet (the background sound is way too dominant) so within the first 20 minutes you're already not following what's going on. It's not the viewers responsibility to watch a film 3 times because the sound production dept can't do their job.
3. Visually boring. There was a blandness about many of the sets. Remember the Japanese house at the start on Inception? And the ""sea world"" in Interstellar? Tenet lacks imagination and everything looks boring.
4. Complexity in itself doesn't make a film interesting. Tenet is just too complex and isn't worth it. It's a quzzle you don't care if you don't solve. There are lots of film that don't lay everything on a plate for the viewer (e.g. Enemy, 2001 Space Oddisy etc) but they're WORTH it.For the first time ever, I nearly walk out half way through. I endured to the end and was glad it was over.I'm genuinely surprised that there are so many 10/10 rating for this. I'm pretty good at following complex films but Tenet is just tediously complex.There are some good things about Tenet (Pattinson and Brannagh's performances), but overall, Tenet is poor.",Tenet

Agreed, there are some great action scenes and i always like movies that try something different. I even liked the acting alot, but all in all I had this feeling ""dont give the viewer any info at start and then we can mix it all up..do some twist in the end (not really cos even watching with half an eye i cud predict everything that happened) and then make it look like this great timeline. I also lacked any connection with the characters and i didnt even feel bad the world as we know it was coming to end....Partly because they dont tell u anything in the beginning...who is who, why are they doing wat they do and so on....? On top of that the hand to hand combat scenes didnt really feel like people was fighting...more like they were doing some kind of weird dance...yeah sure it fits the story, but whats a fight without fighting??
In the end i felt like it possibly was a 5hr movie that had to be cut to fit 2.5 and maybe things were lost.

We usually see him either play with narrative structure to make a puzzle out of the time line (memento for example), or we see him play around with the concept of time and space in someway (Inception, Interstellar). But here we get the best of both worlds, although making the story a bit too complex to understand but a second watch will surely blow your mind. This movie is too goof even for Nolan's standards.I believe this won't get a higher ever because mostly people won't bother to pay for watching the same movie multiple times, hence it will mostly be under-understood.But I do recommend this one, exactly what we needed after a long break from movie theaters. Some dialogues aren't clear enough to understand because of the way they are delivered or sometimes suppressed by environmental sounds. Other than that this one is a solid 10/10.Both the protagonists (since John David Washington is 'A Protagonist') did a great job and inversed action sequences are huge directorial and cerographical achievements.",Tenet

Tenet does this, but then oversteps the boundary and falls over a cliff.I, like most people, like movie that you need to use your head a bit to figure out whats going on, but it needs to be enjoyable. Tenet is not that, the frustration that comes from trying to figure out what goes on in the in this movie completely takes away the element that is enjoying a movie experience. Tenet loses the essence of what a film is supposed to be, entertainment. This film is not entertaining at all! Putting aside all the confusion about what's going, the characters are completely bland, John Washington and Robert Pattinson's characters are no more interesting than a blank piece of paper. Elizabeth Debicki, although acting very well in this movie, had a very dull character to work with. The script does not do much for the characters at all.Outside the box, yes it is. But I feel that most positive reviews are simply praising it because it is a Christopher Nolan movie and it is so outside the box, and nothing more - this does not make it a groundbreakingly good film, because it lacks all the other ingredients needed.Positives: it is strikingly beautiful to watch and the visual effects are phenomenal. And as much as the audio is criticised, I think the sound mixing is fantastic, the blend of real time audio with reverse sound effects for the alternate timelines is quite impressive.

4767,ofenton01,"Nolan reiterating Inception - bold, ambitious and very slightly flawed filmaking",8,28 August 2020,"20 minutes in I'm thinking this is good. 45 mins its starting to lag. 55 minutes in I'm thinking this is a convoluted mess. 1h 30 in I'm thinking I was too quick to judge. 2h I'm in thinking its good. 2h 30 in the credits roll and I admire how ambitious Nolan is as a director once again. Yet film has serious flaws.You thought Inception was confusing. It's simplistic in comparison, but probably more accessible and interesting conceptually. Plotwise the story of Tenet is wrote, but well told, maintaining momentum through constantly shifting goals, stakes and urgency. In terms of mechanics, it definitely the most ambitious and interesting approach to time travel since Primer, with less is more specification embedded in physics - but without Interstellars unforgivable ""love is measurable universal force"" hokum. Effects are interesting and technically Nolan is as ever this generation's unsurpassed director for physical stuntwork. Throughout Nolan adopts a revisionist approach to his own filmaking, critically assessing and seeking to improve iterations of his previous work, at times succeeding such as the final end piece.Yet at other points he (knowingly?) pokes fun at himself (unbeknownst?), mining his own back catalogue to make what seems a to be a reverential pastiche of his signature stylings. Speaking of pastiches, the 'character' potrayed by John David Washington is beyond approach (yet well acted if this was the intent), an arrogant hubristic American action hero in the mould of Jack Burton with none of the charm. Was Dominic Cobb of Inception too moody, too developed...well here's the cut-rate version kicking ass and talking sass in this year's self proclaimed protagonist you hope to never see a sequel about. What growth he experiences is fundamentally undermined by his excruciating clunky dialogue. Brannagh is serviceable as ever going full Bond villain and refining his earlier Ruski attempt from Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit. Pattison steals the show, undeniably the best performance in the film, the guys a serious actor and elevates this every moment he's on screen. Nolan knows everybody loved Tom Hardy's classy Brit in Inception, so basically lampshades him here with Pattinson...and then doubles down with Aaron Taylor Johnsons very similar character (also excellent).Overall as Nolan's budgets increase, he has constantly expanded his ambition. Where Inception felt like his homage to the Matrix for a new generation, Tenet feels like his homage to Inception. It's a glossy remake in all but name, but there's too much attachment to that formula and he cant recapture the original taste despite following the recipe lavishly. Overall, it's a solid movie where again Nolan tries a little too hard - not always a bad thing.",Tenet

Having said that, this was the perfect first film back after lockdown. It's a proper action movie with brilliant set pieces and has a very unusual soundtrack and sound effects. Some have said it's too loud but I loved that, the noise reverberated around the auditorium and right into my chest providing the full cinematic experience. The locations are also fab including two of my favourite places, Tallinn and Amalfi. John David Washington is a very likeable lead in it performing alongside Elizabeth Debicki and Robert Pattinson. Washington's character is known as the Protagonist but you are left questioning right up until the end who is really pulling the strings of this time bending story.

You may walk away both feeling like you don't understand it intuitively AND intellectually.

1.read about it
2.The words at the beginning of the film : don't try to understand it-feel it are directed to the viewer and are the best advice for you.

3.The second part of the film will explain almost everything if at the beginning you more or less caught what it's all about.

4796,dylanjohannson,Almost a masterpiece,9,4 September 2020,"This review contains very slight spoilers to Tenet and Inception.Tenet is a visual and audio spectacle made for the big screen. I watched it three times by now and loved it. The writing is incredibly intelligent and well thought out, the action is absolutely stunning, especially when considering almost everything was photographed on set instead of animated in a studio. Very typical for a Nolan film.
The music is extremely bombastic and has a lot of gravitas to it. My favourite tracks are the music right at the beginning and when you first get to see the 747 from beneath. Seriously, it's an absolute marvel on the big screen. I managed to watch it on a 600m² screen, the largest in Europe (Cinemagnum in Nürnberg) and it was definitely worth it. It's one of those big picture movies that absolutely needs to be seen on as large a screen as possible, with the best speaker system possible.The only two things I can seriously criticise without nitpicking are the weird sound mixing and the emotional distance between the characters and the audience. Let's start with the sound: the sound design is superb and the sound mixing during action sequences adds a lot to the cinematic experience. However, important pieces of dialogue are sometimes inaudible because of loud music and sound effects (The boat scene and every time someone talks with a mask on are especially bad, I probably missed 15% of dialogue throughout the film the first time I saw it). I realize this is a creative decision made by Nolan and I can respect that. He did the same in Interstellar and Dunkirk where he would use dialogue as just another sound effect that could be drowned out by music and explosions or shooting to underline the noise level during a particular scene. In those two films that made a lot of sense, I just felt that with Tenet, important dialogue gave way to not so important sound effects (like that weird boat scene). After my first viewing, I left the cinema slightly confused (although I absolutely enjoyed the film anyway). After seeing it multiple times I've had less problems with understanding sound.
The bigger ""problem"" for me is the emotional distance between characters and audience. Let me explain: In my eyes, Inception is Nolans best film to date, possibly the best film I have ever seen, certainly the film I've seen most. To me, it's cinematic perfection. Acting, music, sound editing, cinematography and writing are a joy to experience over and over again. What makes it stand out to me is the way it creates an emotional attachment to the main Character, Dom Cobb. We see flashbacks to his wife and children throughout the film, reminding us that Cobb's journey is about dealing with the loss of his wife and trying to get back to his children. One scene in particular actually brings me close to tears every single time I see it: when Cobb's kids phone him in the beginning and James asks where his mother is. This is one of my favourite scenes in all of cinema. The way the music shifts and the staging of that particular flashback to his wife perfectly show how important the emotional part to the story is. I didn't feel any of that with Tenet. The characters behave just the way they should, giving away as little as possible about themselves to protect Tenet and each member. That makes a lot of sense, it just doesn't create any emotional attachment to anyone. We don't know anything about The Protagonist or his partners in crime/time. There are some moments where the relationship between Kat, Max and Sator are explained, but not really shown. Show, don't tell.Overall, Tenet is an absolute spectacle, I love it and plan to watch it again in a cinema just to see that 747 again. Or the chase on the Estonian motorway. Or the absolutely brilliantly crafted inversion scenes that are like nothing I have ever experienced before on the big screen. Tenet is a jaw dropping experience that has the potential to become an instant classic for me and many others. You've done it again, Mr. Nolan, you've created something special and I salute you. One of the last great directors, pioneer of the IMAX format and saviour of cinema.",Tenet

4798,turrinilorenzo,"First look, nice movie, needs 30 minutes more",9,31 August 2020,"BIT SPOILERSLets start with cons:-Great movie, as stated in the title it should have been at least 20/30 minutes longer to understand the last battle better. It's not complicated, just there are a lot of things going on too fast, and at the first view, even if the action is cool, it's easy to miss what is realy going on with those red and blue squads-Talking as an Italian viewer, the audio was perfect, maybe it was adgiusted in our version, i dont know, i've seen there are a lot of complains about it, but In the version i've seen every dialogue is totaly undesrtandable ( expect one time, but it's just a bit of metacinema that in the end feels good -Spoiler. Fist time in the airport the music is far too high, thats just because the second time they will go there, the music will be high due to the tension and i suppose the director just played the same music backwards, without adjusting the volume)
As i said, maybe it has been adjusted in the italian audio version.-Beside that, with good audio the movie feels great, of course it leave you with a bit of ""there must be more in this movie that what i've seen"" but thats tipical of Nolan movies, it's expected and shouldn't be considered a cons. In my opinion this not ruin the first view that is still pretty good.-It's not the best Nolan movie but i'm not reviewing this in ""Nolan scale"". it's not inception but i mean, which movie is incepiont other then inception? It's a pretty good movie still, far better then 95% of blockbusters out there.-It's not NOIR and i know that may disappoint some fans, i would like to see Nolan back on some noir stuff too but that's not the case, this movie is full action and plot. That's even why the charaters are stereotips. That is true, if you expect a good noir movie, with deep reflections, you can be disappointed.-There is a subplot that is not very important but it's more used as an introduction to the real movie. You may or may not like thisOk all the cons are gone in my opinion lets talk about the pro:-The movie feels dark, almost steampunk sometimes. It feels like realy serious about those time inversion like its a realy big deal, expecialy when the big bad boss controls the inversion and the enemy comes from the future.
That makes the movie feels strong and keep your attention high.-The story stay togheter pretty well, even with the obvious complexity of managing an ""almost time travel"" stuff, it feels, at least during a first view, that no logical barrier as been broken and all the pieces of the puzzle stays where they have too. Some explanation may be week, ok, but the overall feeling is pretty ok. If i will watch it a second time i'll back on this part.-The movie is obviously well made, but thats something i feel anyone knows even before going into the cinema. I mean, you don't expect this kind of movies to be poorly made. Nice touch the music played backwards-It's not boring. I know it seems stupid to say but i've seen a lot of people saying this movie is boring. Still it depends of your expectations but in my opinion this movie is not boring at all. The choice of limited background stories for charaters pay off pretty well.

Background sounds and music are too loud so dialogues are not clearFirst half of the movie might is hard to grasp but things get more clear in the second halfSome people will not get itI was extra focused on dialogues and details which otherwise can easily be missed. Cinema being mostly empty due to Corona helped. The focus enabled me to catch most of the hidden parts and understand the movie, although I'm quite certain I will find more gems on the subsequent watches.The movie has one of the most complex stories I've seen. It has also very quick pace which doesn't give you enough time to digest what happened in the scene, before moving on to another scene.The acting is brilliant, as well as effects and of course the story, but this will never become a blockbuster like some other Nolan's movies did. Simply, because a lot of people will not understand it. And that's fine, I guess.So ignore all those reviews that give this movie low scores. These people did not understand the movie. If you are one of them, I can only say I'm sorry.I give it 9, because the sound mastering could have been better, especially at the beginning of the movie where it's really hard to distinguish dialogue from loud music.

This is not a Scorsese or a Spielberg film, this is Christopher Nolan. So many people now are just looking for cheap, easy and mindless emotional entertainment that they won't give this film a second thought.After seeing most of Nolan's films, the question was for me, ""how is Nolan going to pull off another mind bending film""? Let me just say he did. After all of his previous work, Nolan is taking it to a higher level. This film actually shows that he is elevating his craft.I have seen the movie three times now and Each time I watched it my understanding of the whole story has grown exponentially. The movie deals with the concept of time inversion in which characters from the future are lending information to people from the past. I believe that this is what Nolan had in mind for his audience to experience. I truly found that through my 3 times viewing this movie my past self was helping my current self understand better.This is masterful and creates a viewing experience that doesent waste money on a cheap action thriller.Some are badgering about the sound quality and I u sweat and it is a bit hard to understand. I have seen it in multiple theatres and some were bad and some were far better. I have learned that each word is carefully weighed out and lends to the better understanding. Try to watch this is a cinema with good sound quality!!Others are disappointed because the scenes seem too convoluted. For me, I felt that way at first because I didn't understand the premise. Once I did, I could see that the entire movie as a whole is perfectly executed leading you where it wants you to go.There are many details and clues that you will miss on your first viewing. Don't feel bad, I believe once you go back you will notice that every detail is well placed and thought out. It takes time going back to understand what you need to know and interestingly enough that is what the whole concept of the movie is about.I wholeheartedly disagree with any and all YouTube commentators that say that some scenes are just ""filler"".

(Pun intended),9,5 September 2020,"TENET is a once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.And not just for the visuals, the stunning action set pieces, the preference for practical effects over usage of CGI, or the awesome soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson.But for its insanely complex plot.To conceptualize such a multi-layered, crisp and smart script is already impressive. But to put it on paper, bring it to life via the visual medium of cinema, is just genius.I'll admit there are several elements of the plot I'm still trying to make sense of, but I'm glad I managed to have AT LEAST understood the main and general idea of the story. (Which in itself feels like a Herculean accomplishment)Emotional hangover is a thing, but I'm having an ""intellectual hangover"" from it. But I absolutely love this.It's sad to see a few critics bash this movie with poor ratings, because they don't like the complex aspect or that they have to make an effort to understand it. It's a bit like someone who is lactose intolerant giving a bad rating to a cheese fondue dish in a restaurant, simply because they can't eat it.That being said, one big flaw, and the only one I can think of currently which unfortunately impacts this experience, is the poor choice of the sound mixing. You can barely understand the dialogs over the score, which really makes you work hard to understand what the actors are saying.Can't wait to re-watch it (with English subtitles) once it's released digitally.

4819,bharatntie,Nolan's Best!!!,10,21 August 2021,"My mind is just blown, Christopher Nolan's intention was for the enthusiastic bunch to watch again, so it is unfair for anyone to complain about the plot being too convoluted.Even if the story is hard to follow, the movie is a visual spectacle. I find Interstellar/Inception has the best visuals of Nolan's movies, but this came very close. I just watched some scenes 100 times just for the visuals (not to understand the plot).The visuals were complemented by Ludwig Göransson's background score, in the first scene of the movie the music seemed a little derivate from the Dark Knight, however as the movie went on there was something unique about the music which made it a very memorable experience.As per the plot.. well mind blown. This is a very unique concept, however Nolan toys with time, this movie will age well and it would trigger a lot of nerdy coffee table conversations for years to come. It would be hard for Nolan to top a plot like this for the concept of time, For me the story is a little bit important.Most of the cast was terrific, only complain is Kenneth Braganh's role who was a little bit theatric, if the plot was thin his character would have been a huge downer but the plot carried his performance. 'I was really disappointed at the B+ consensus for this movie. Yes the dialogues are a little bit hard to hear and yes it can get highly technical very quickly but then that is what sci-fi movies are especially Nolan's one, we have to take things in and re-watch for the visual experience and plot. This is nothing new with Nolan, do not know why people use that as an excuse for the above average rate, at worst this was an A-.",Tenet
4820,jakobbakhtiari,Very high concept,8,2 December 2020,"It requires quite a bit of exposition, but by the time the concept comes into play, you're grateful for it. Tenet was a very well orchestrated and fresh approach on time travel, that does require more than one viewing. It's really hard to understand some of the later establishing shots when some of the scenes are supposed to be inverted people and conventional people in the same place, but when you know what you're looking at it all falls into line quite well. I'm sure it will be more enjoyable on Blu-ray with subtitles.",Tenet
4821,wlund12,"Cold, Confusing and hollow",3,17 January 2021,"First off I wanna say I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. But I have to say this is the most self indulgent, inaccessible Nolan Film yet.There is virtually no character development on any of the characters. Because of this, most of the characters are devoid of any characteristics that would keep us engaged or care about them. This is done to the point where the main character doesn't even have a name and is only referred to as ""the protagonist"". The whole film is Washington running from epic set piece to set piece with no clear goal or objective in mind. I cringe sometimes looking at these epic set pieces and explosions with no real depth behind them, what a waste of money. I love watching complex movies and watching them a second and third time learning more about them, but I was not able to understand any of this movie even from the get-go, not even a little. Even worse, you don't want to take the time to understand this one either. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that there is no emotional core to ground the film. We really have no idea why he's doing this, other than the slight idea that he wants to save this woman's kid that he doesn't even know and we don't even meet the ""kid"" once in the whole film. In the movie inception cob wants to get back to his family, and interstellar Matthew McConaughey also wants to get back to his family while discovering the universe. These examples ground those films while layering on the Nolan Syfy so it's digestible. At times this can feel like a Nolan parody.Now onto John David Washington. First off let me say I have not seen him in anything else and after checking his IMDb he has only one other big film under his belt, that I heard he was good in and well received. I thought his performance was incredibly one note throughout the whole movie. The same color was being played in every dialogue scene he had. To his credit I don't think this script gave him anything to really chew into, it seemed he was just a fast moving expositional vehicle for the film with no character backstory or defining characteristics. I admit he was physically fit for the role and performed all the choreography and stunts to perfection, but that only goes so far.The only reason I'm giving this three stars is for the solid cinematography and stunt/fight choreography throughout the film. Score was good but I don't think it matches the level of Zimmer in Nolan's past films.This movie has definitely lowered my appreciation for Christopher Nolan.",Tenet
4822,fra-c,Watch it twice! Why? Because you need a 'temporal pincer movement' to understand it!,10,22 September 2020,"Nolan's passion for meta-cinema is crystal clear. The Prestige revolved around the implicit agreement between a director and its public (""you want to be fooled""). Inception's ending (the spinning top) was about the aim of cinema, that to instill under audience's skin the very doubt about its nature: is it just a dream-fiction or is it reality - and above all, does the answer make any difference at all on an experiential-emotional level? Interstellar's message was even subtler: the emergence of human meanings (love, guiding Cooper in the tesseract) may have top-down effects onto fundamental laws and the very fabric of spacetime, a causal loop jeopardizing the common prejudice that they are just 'illusions' adding nothing to the linear, reductionist view - a reference to the alleged 'illusions' created by cinema, whose connections with reality are far deeper than usually thought.Tenet pushes this attitude to its extreme consequences. The film, I suspect, is intended to be seen twice, and not just in order to better understand the plot. Inasmuch the same way as movie's characters leverage upon the 'temporal pincer movement' to improve their understanding of the events they are living, though aware that 'what has happened has happened', the second vision dramatically complements the first one. When you enter the cinema the second time you know that you are not going to see anything different, but while the first time you were furiously dragged by the action and the tangled plot, you now can look at the same events with the benefit of hindsight.How many times we feel, in our lives, pulled forward by the unavoidable irreversibility of time arrow, unable to understand all the complexity of what's going on, forced to just follow the flow of events? Everyday we accept, with respect to our lives, the same suggestion given to the protagonist: 'don't try to understand it, feel it'. And everyday, we desperately would like to be able to speak to our past selves, offering them future insights and wise advices out of our experiences. But we cannot. We can live our lives just once. Or does we? We cannot change the past, but this does not happen in Tenet either: as in this movie, the future does not modify the past, but just adds new information which helps us to shed new light on past events, to understand them better and better. Every new experience is a new way to see our past, to tell our story - the story which has us and only us as 'the Protagonist'.This is Tenet message: cinema allows us to live the same emotions again and again, to see ourselves mirrored in infinitely many different imaginary lives, and in this way to better grasp the only real life we have - and that we can only live 'fast forward'...",Tenet

From the opulent film scenery, down right to the time-twisted narratives that are inspired by edge of your seat theoretical physics, the entire production has indeed set a bar for creative control. Not only does Tenet pay an ode and borrow a leaf from previous cinematics, it's also an embodiment of Nolan's sheer creativity and witty imagination.

4828,sgruener-999-697548,"Better storyline needed, but still enjoyable",7,2 February 2021,"Tenet is a convoluted ride that requires close attention even for those familiar with the complexities of Nolan's universes. Those who dislike Inception might find it difficult to appreciate the film, and despite convincing performances from the cast and a great production, the film doesn't reach the height of Nolan's previous work. Washington is a cold yet convincing Protagonist and Pattinson lends a great deal of depth to what is a relatively standard role, however the character of Kat, whilst performed well by Debicki, seems flimsy and weak. Why is Kat's survival so important that the Protagonist would risk the survival of the world? Why did she pull the trigger before the signal was given? Whilst ultimately Debicki's character proves her strength, there is a certain 'damsel in distress' aspect that left a bad taste, and decisions made by a number of characters are difficult to understand.
The concept of time inversion was intriguing and improved what was a fragile plot, and as a whole Tenet was an enjoyable film with great production and acting. However, it would have been improved with a stronger story line and fails to live up to Nolan's previous works.",Tenet

4839,Welloffatties,A soulless film...,3,3 September 2020,"Another unsolvable puzzle by Cristopher Nolan.
I never really liked Cristopher Nolan's films. I always thought of them as too dark, too serious, and too pretentious. However, with Tenet coming out, I decided to give the director one more chance. Maybe I was missing something? Maybe this time I could figure out what the hype was all about.... Well I was wrong.The film takes place in (as usual in C.N. films) a realistic world in the near future. I have to say that I lost interest at the moment when we saw the bullet flying backwards for the first time. How could that ever be possible? I searched for possible answers in my mind and I could find no answer. ''Don't try to understand'' the woman said at the end of that scene. ''That's easy.'' I tought.Since this whole past/present thing is presented in a really realistic way, there is no way this is a case of suspension of disbilief. If that was the case then the need for an explanation would vanish beneath the great wave of my indifference. But that wasn't the case.
This whole past/present/reverse time thing was presented as true and real and it just felt silly to me. I sometimes started laughing aloud, since the so called explications went on. And on. In fact, the rest of the film felt like it served almost entirely as a explication on why all of this situation was possible. The worst thing, after all, was how these ''explications'' were executed... Through DIALOGUE. And since I felt ZERO sympathy for the characters (the great director didn't offer the actors any opportunity to show their human side), the dialogue was terribly boring boring BORING. They tried to make it more interesting by alternating the talking with some flashbacks. That felt very cheap. The fighting scenes were cheaply executed as well. A shaky camera and some fast cuts to cover up for the actors who can't really fight.I hadn't the feeling there was ANYTHING at stake during the enitre film. It was said they were preventing world war III but it is never shown. Also, it felt like there wasn't any variation in the kind of scenes... Some fighting, some dialogue. Some fighting again. Etc. It felt very monotonous because there wasn't any emotion. On the contrary: it felt utterly mechanic.One positive thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects were really nicely done. But just some good special effects doesn't mean a movie is any good.A soulless film. Even technically or visually not that interesting.
They robbed me of my 10 bucks. It is also the first time it occured to me to actually walk out while watching a film at the movies. Don't believe the hype. Still giving this 3 stars for the special effects.",Tenet

4841,trvdv1,Impressive stunt work,3,13 December 2020,"...too bad it's poorly shot and realized on screen. I fell asleep during the 'big car chase' scene. Nolan is entering Lucas territory here, allowing himself to get overblown in his own ego. The actors are in for it, and props to them, but they can't save this. The idea of time inversion is a cool idea, but it goes too far into reality, tho not far enough; a bit of 'suspension of disbelief' is fun and interesting, but Nolan clearly favors the notion of going as far as possible in terms of logic, which means it's harder to believe, and easier to see flaws without even trying.

The movie pace is quite fast and the information all comes from dialogue. But at least trying to figure out rather than giving a bad review straight away.

I hated this with Interstellar, and I hated it here too. Yes, Time Travel can be a difficult concept, but Nolan makes absolutely zero effort to make you care about any of the people on the screen, and instead banks on holding your interest with stunning visuals.And yes, it has some amazing stunning visuals! Seeing some action sequences happening the way they do just made my jaw drop to the floor. But that's where the enjoyment of this film ended. By the end of it, I was lost and confused and my ears were ringing.It is telling that for people 45 and up that this film's rating drops off pretty quickly, and so you know who the target audience was.

4879,aggarwalanuj,"Fascinating, yet leaves something to be deired",7,29 December 2020,"Chris Nolan has given us one of the better spy-thrillers I've ever seen. The brilliant negative energy concept called as inversion in the film prevents it from being a lame time travel film. This is Nolan's take on a Bond film, without the cheesy aspects of those films such as a damsel in distress or a villain with unfounded evil.Elizabeth Debicki (Kat) and Kenneth Branagh's (Sator) excellent performances are the heart of this film. Robert Pattinson with his unmatched charisma is also brilliant and his character Neil is more of a protagonist in this film than the actual 'Protagonist' played blandly by John D. Washington who just seems like an observer providing no real value to the film, functioning only as an accessory to the plot as the founder of the organisation Tenet in the future. His loving relationship with Kat has no basis in the script and seemed forced.The scenes with inverted characters are cool as hell, but they also interfere with the pacing of the film. The editing has its ups and downs exhibiting brilliance at times while feeling rushed at some points; for example, the shot where Kat jumps from the yacht should have lingered a little longer. The score is very original with Posterity and The Protagonist being the highlights and fits perfectly at times like when Neil's death and his relationship with The Protagonist is revealed. But, the final battle was quite boring mostly because of a lack of exciting background score for extended periods.All in all, this film amazed with exciting concepts and had an above average plot, but lacked the technical finesse witnessed in Nolan's earlier works.",Tenet

I can't say that I understood it well, so I will definitely need to watch it once more and then discuss it with people. But it is a very original idea about time that no other movie ever used before. All the previous movies about time travel was taking the time one directional, even when they travelled back in time.This one takes a different approach which suddenly opens up a lot of complicated possibilities. Reading other reviews, it is rather sad that people get angry or disappointed when they can't understand a physics concept, instead of trying to understand. When did viewers become so lazy, just wanting to watch something simple where they don't need to use much of their brains?
Spending so much time and energy on the brilliant idea and nice visuals, the movie falls behind on characters. They are not deep enough and so are the dialogues that is not about the main idea of the movie. Again, the main idea is so strong that, the rest can maybe be forgiven.But one thing that can't be forgiven is the terrible terrible sound mix. Whoever did the mastering really failed badly. Coversations are inaudable, sound effects are too loud, even when there is a conversation.All in all, the original idea saves the movie and places it among the top Si-Fi movies of the last years.",Tenet

He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also waayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:""Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen"").I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.Its worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand whats going on the first time around.",Tenet

And again. And again. Because I sat down in the movie theatre thinking: I am probably going to have to watch this more than once. Like with most of Nolan's movies. Because once I really understand his movies, when I see all the little details, appreciate every shot, every word and the complexity of it all - I love it.I was disappointed to learn that my favourite composer, and Christopher Nolan's faithful movie composer, Hans Zimmer wasn't going to score this movie. But I was calm and intrigued when I found out Ludwig Göransson was. And boy did he have me convinced I was in for a ride after the first five minutes. The music is loud and immense and sometimes irritating. Especially when you can hear how the music is telling you this right here is awesome and brilliant and you understand f*ck all. Because 85% of the time, I really didn't. However, I thought I for sure understood that casting Kenneth Branagh was a huge mistake but the more I saw him the more I started to understand that I didn't understand that either, because it certainly was not a mistake casting him.I can safely say: I was there, I saw it, I felt it, I liked it, I didn't get it but it was a ride! It was like a dance at times and like a hangover at other times.
That being said; I am not convinced Tenet is too smart for me. I did get the end but I needed more to understand the freaking middle. Sometimes it felt like when a teacher changes a slide in the PowerPoint presentation because ""you all get this, I don't have to explain this to you"". And you're left not understanding because you weren't given the chance to understand.The more I think about it I am convinced that I missed a vital scene or a sentence when I was trying to figure out if I should continue eating the popcorn or start with the chocolate. Anyway, I will watch it again and atleast then I'll be prepared for when the teacher (Nolan) is going to change the slide, so I can hurry up and take some notes.",Tenet

When they executed this kind of story really well, it really is become a masterpiece, such as Interstellar and Inception. But not with Tenet. The story in this movie feels really dragged out, even with 2,5 hour long. Characters are probably the worst here. They just mumbling the line without expressing any emotion. It feels like there is no 'real character' in this movie. The music are also too loud in some scenes.Some people said that you will appreciate this movie even more after you try to rewatched it.

4897,mxwadia,Currently waiting for myself to run back in time and explain this movie to me,7,25 August 2020,"(No spoilers included, I cannot possibly spoil a movie I did not even understand)I've been a huge fan of Nolan ever since Doodlebug, but this man's obsession with time is why I can no longer sleep ever since I saw Tenet. What sets Nolan's movies apart is that you're not just watching, or even experiencing them - you're also constantly trying to figure them out throughout it's runtime (and some more). And that process has always been fulfilling and gratifying for me. I personally love movies that entertain me while also blowing my mind - the kind of movies that still seem new on a second or a third watch.However, Tenet was simply incomprehensible - most probably because the dialogues weren't audible to anyone in the theatre. At first, I imagined this was a problem with the cinema I visited, but multiple reviews from Australia mention this. Also, the cast is wearing masks for most of it, so this should have been accounted for. I don't know how a movie that managed to deal with a complex shooting script and intricate visual effects completely messed up simple sound mastering.I dearly hope that with decent audio, and/or subtitles, Tenet makes sense. But if not, then I think we ought to praise films that are great and also tough to understand, instead of praising films just because they were dealing with complex physics, and made no sense. We should not be rewarding movie's simply on their virtue of being hard to understand.However, to Tenet's credit - the movie is largely entertaining, even though it's annoying and frustrating to not understand the context for most of it. It is engaging and grasping, even with inaudible dialogues. The cinematography is a visual art piece, and the main cast does a phenomenal job.Again to Tenet's credit, watching the trailer after the movie (In true Tenet time inversion style) was helpful. I have never before understood more from a trailer, than I have from a movie. I cannot wait for my future self to watch this movie again, either with half-clear audio or subtitles - and figure out if Tenet is a magnificent movie that has scope for comprehension, botched just because of an amateur mastering error, or if it was always made to be hailed as genius just because it is inherently incomprehensible.In summary, Tenet is like your last relationship -
You're glad you experienced it for it was entertaining and interesting at times, even though at the end you were left feeling empty and unsatisfied, for you did not understand or get anything out of it - and are now constantly wondering if it was you or just the relationship that was flawed.",Tenet

The fact of the matter is this film isn't for everyone. You have to be invested in the idea of inversion as a whole to truly understand this film. Not Emily from buzzfeed who's favorite movie is twilight. Is tenet complicated? Hell yes. Tenet is easily director Christopher Nolan's most complex film to date but it's also his most ambitious in that right. This is Christopher Nolan's take on a bond film and wow is it spectacular. Now to actually the review part of the movie. Tenet clearly shows that most of Christopher Nolan's work has led up to this film. You can see influences of Inception, Memento, and Dunkirk clearly present. That is not a critisism however due to it only elevating the film to be somewhat familiar but still a breathe of fresh air from the ""rollercoaster films"" we are used to seeing in 2020. The only critisism I have for tenet is the setting up for the story was not done as well as it could and became often a jumbled mess of connections to characters that you know nothing else about. The biggest strength of tenet is its last act however. The pacing is incredible and keeps you invested in the films finale. The ending didn't quite have the punch of Nolan's other films such as Interstellar but it still was a satisfying ending none the less. I do hope Nolan goes against his norms and makes a sequel for tenet however as out of all Nolan's films other than the dark knight this film cries for a sequel. In conclusion tenet isn't for the people looking for a simple film or people who have critisized Nolan's films in the past but if you do not fall under that category then Tenet is an engaging spy movie like none you have ever seen before and is among the director's best.

This greatly reduces it's quality in trying to watch it together with other people, especially if you've already seen it, it will only leave your friends and family puzzled and you trying to explain.

So if you're into that kind of thing give it a fair chance to fulfill it's purpose of entertaining you. Don't be fooled by the fake news & social justice user reviews. It's too bad that in 2020 so many movie goers & reviewers found themselves watching the only movie they could, instead of the only movie they would. Then writing misleading reviews as a result. Maybe they could use a hug? A masked, sanitized, socially distanced virtual hug of course.",Tenet

The Prestige is still one of my all time favorite top ten movies. Yet the more movies Nolan makes, the more the luster wears off.Most of of Nolan's movies have some psuedo-science schtick you're asked to take with a leap of faith. Tesla's machine in Prestige. The gravity beings in Interstellar. Matroshyka dreams in Inception. See the pattern here? At his best Nolan is a supremely polished Abrams or Rian Johnson: more interested in advancing his vision than offering substance.Tenet is not his best.A review I read said that Tenet's problem is that Nolan has reached a level where he doesn't have to listen to anyone -- there's no one to pull him back and tell him something isn't working. Tenet is that ultimate conceit.It's a time-jinx movie that only explains half the rules... and then breaks all of them. Inversion is a gimmick that's used masterfully exactly ONCE. The rest of the time it's just smoke and mirrors to distract you from the fact that there is no reason to the movie, that it's characters are cardboard thin, the dialog is terrible, and at it's heart it's just a cerebral wannab-Bond flick that doesn't get the cerebral part right.Congrats, Mr. Nolan.

4934,matebeduino,Simply hard to understand what is going on,5,11 September 2020,"If you read other reviews most of them talk about the sound problems and how you need to watch it more than once, but still they scored very high this movie. That's wrong: I should pay twice to understand it?
Well, I'm not watching it again until it's is out for streaming free. So with my one view I left the theatre confused and frustrated. My wife left before it was over, angry at the movie.
You see, it looked like a very interesting and complete story is happening or its about to happen but then you missed it, because you didn't hear or didn't understand some clue. In the final main action scene, I kept asking why is she doing that, what does it mean that red string the camera focuses on the backpack, who is who in the battle, etc.
The subtitles where in Arabic which I don't speak. They should be in English by default and come with a printed guide before you go in.
But I would argue that even with clear sound the story needed better editing or scenes that would allow you to understand and to connect.
That was another huge issue: the emotional connection to plot was quite low. Yes there is a girl in distress threatened by a monster, and the protagonist wants to save her, but between the two there's no romance, and should we care about her, if she was the monster's girlfriend.
But that's s very weak reason for the whole movie. What is driving the protagonist? Just that someone said ""the end of the world"", when he wakes up with no recollection of what is going on? Again, very weak emotion to push him to risk everything. Why is he doing it?
After I left the cinema I had to read the plot elsewhere, and even then it didn't sound very thrilling on its own. Again the poor emotional connection of the plot.In inception movie, also from Nolan, there was plenty of emotional connection with the protagonist dead wife popping up in his dream world unexpectedly, his kids waiting for him in the country he's not allowed to enter, and a history between the other characters.The production and acting are all of a big movie. But a miss in the dialogues/sound and the editing.",Tenet

4938,mattroycebalmforth,Truly terrible,3,2 January 2021,"Tenet is perhaps the worst film by a good director I've ever seen. The script is as unengaging as it is nonsensical; Nolan sprays a wild array of plot directions into a dialogue which leaves even sympathetic audience members scratching their heads. The dialogue is delivered by actors who seem every bit as confused as we are. The actor playing the lead role tries to compensate for this by delivering his lines in an unbroken monotone which is every bit as annoying as the overacting supporting cast members. What little bit of action I got round to watching seemed decent enough, but the rest of the film comes across nothing more than a flabby Frankenstein's monster jolted into shambling half-life by half baked leftover ideas from Inception and Interstellar.

4950,brandoncjenkins,Be patient,7,12 September 2020,"If you are expecting the adrenaline you got with Inception, look no further. If you are looking to be able to follow this film on the first viewing like you did with Inception, maybe not so much. I would put this film one level higher in complexity than Inception, as Inception was complex but pretty intuitive. This film CAN be intuitive, but unless you want to wait for the Blu Ray, you're going to have to shell out to see it multiple times to actually get a better understanding of the plot's finer points.
A more logistical thing to comment on: it seems the audio mix is lacking. I originally thought it was my theater (voices seem to carry too much bass, making them hard to understand; however, Studio Movie Grill plays this film very, very loud, which I love because it makes the gunfire far more realistic), but others have complained about this as well. I am hoping that the blu ray will be remastered so that this is not an issue.
With all this being said, be patient. This film is great and I have a strong feeling you will not be disappointed. It is classic Nolan doing what he does best. It is intricate, spares no expense, and it is by no means lazy. Once the BR comes out, it may actually turn into one his his best so far.",Tenet
4951,pedromiguelzuzarte,Not the masterpiece it could have been... Nolan's a genius but failed to deliver,7,28 August 2020,"I'm a hardcore Christopher Nolan's fan but not blind to the painful flaws this movie has.I couldn't be more hyped for this movie.. and it almost delivered. But overall it failed in the end. I really miss what this movie could have been. I cannot believe the rough edges were not taken into consideration when finishing this movie. It could have been a true masterpiece, probably the greatest movie by Nolan. Unfortunately it will stay ""only"" as an incredibly original movie, with exceptional visuals but that fails to deliver a full package that makes us care. We will not have goose bumps over this movie in years to come, and the reason is simply that we were not given enough time or emotional envolvment to care. But we got a visual and mind-bending spectacle though.In this movie you will find true originality. This movie solidifies Nolan's genius. Tenet brings something really new. And novelty is missing in movies like water in a desert. The acting is solid. The visuals are incredible. It's incredible what was done with the (few) FX. So what went wrong?1. The pace is too fast: This is a movie meant to be watched several times, we will all agree on that. Still, I don't want to care about the characters because I've watch them four times. Will not happen. Character development should have been deeper. We simply don't have time to care about any of the characters. No background, no future projection, no deep motivations, no development. The conversations are so fast, we don't have time to bond with anyone or anything.You can create an epic visual original story but if you don't make us care about the characters it's like watching a really beautiful and original light show. But we really don't care about light bulbs.2. There is no emotion: we enter a world where something truly new is presented. But there is hardly any reaction of the characters to this novelty. The robotic treatment to the mind-bending of time lacks amazement. It's like the concepts don't clash with reality when facts are presented. And they do. But we don't have time or dept to feel that. the lack of emotional response of the characters together with the extremely fast pace makes it difficult to entagle in the new reality that is presented. But is something visually unique3. Motivations: there is no proper exploration of characters motivations. ""We have a war to prevent. Here is mind/time bending stuff. Ok. Let's do it"". Im so disappointed that not enough time and depth was delivered. The ingredients are there but the full cake was not delivered4. Sound: I've liked the soundFx but they did not deliver the impact of sound use in previous Nolan's movies. I don't care about being too loud. I care if it hits the point where it potentiates the emotion. And - maybe because emotion is hardly felt throughout the movie and argument - it doesn't potentiate any emotion beyond the sound because there is a miss match between sound use and depth. Nolan did this so beautifully in the past. Here is simply doesn't work5. I will not go deeper but my recommendation is that you absolutely will watch this movie, but doesn't expect perfection. By far.Overall, thank the movie God's for Christopher Nolan, his originality and his gifts to the cinematic world. We got spoiled over the years with Interstellar, Inception, Dark Night etc. This could have been the greatest in a great list. But it's not in the end and the hard part is that it could have been",Tenet
4952,coltbarkerisu,Second star is out of respect for Nolan,2,3 July 2021,"This movie starts in what felt like the middle of another movie, which for me is always a huge red flag.There isn't a character in the entire film, start to finish, who has the faintest semblance of personality. All characters exist in this movie to explain the movie out loud poorly or be beat up/exploded/shot. If you want a movie with characters, this isn't yours. If not for the cast lost, I wouldn't know a single name from the movie. Our protag doesn't have one at all.Loud, nonsense throughout and there is no pay off. I highly encourage you to find another film to invest time in as this one does not have a point, despite the 8 page long ""explanations"" online.

4957,wiseclown91,Does it live up to the hype?,8,17 September 2020,"Tenet is a sci-fi spy thriller directed by Cristopher Nolan (Memento, Inception). As usual, his film came with a lot of anticipation and then noise about more divided opinions. The action of the film sends us into a spy game, where understanding and combining events from different timelines is key to saving the world. Nolan has already shown many times that time is his favorite toy and Tenet is a film where he wanted to take it to incredible limits.However, this has created some problems. The first of them is that Nolane's ideas require knowledge of the laws of physics, so the characters explain them directly to each other, which is not the most interesting or understandable.
The other big problem lies in characterization of the characters, which, with the absence of real motivation of the Protagonist, leads to that when the action starts to get complicated, we simply don't care enough to catch everything.
The third problem is that we're used to Nolan being technically perfect and everything sounds and looks perfect, but that wasn't the case here. Maybe it's a slightly more confusing montage or that the boomerang effect just doesn't matter to us as much as Nolan thought it would be.On the plus side, there were occasional good moments and Robert Pattinson once again proved that he forgot about vampire days and grew into a very serious actor. It seems to me that this film will be better and clearer after you watch it a few times, but the problem is that I just don't have the desire to do it. Anyway, I recommend that you watch this movie, maybe your dice will match up slightly better.The impression is that Nolan's been playing. He waited about ten years for things to come into place and to imagine it on the film screen. But that kind of waiting, it can blind a man, and he loses some objective awareness of what's more and less interesting to others. That seems to have been the case somewhat.So, what do you think?

And maybe 2 on 10 for story. That kinda averages it to 7 on 10, if the logic makes sense.My summary comment is ""I couldn't make sense, but unlike Inception, I couldnt be bothered to.""Other Nolan films like Memento and Inception are hard to access but ultimately rewarding when you ""get"" it. Tenet is hard to access, but one has no idea if it's ultimately rewarding, because you don't care enough to ""get"" it.This is due both to the deliberate obtuseness of the story as well as the audience's lack of involvement with the main characters.We cared for Matthew McConnaughey in Interstellar, for Guy Pierce in Memento, even for Bale in TDKR. But we simply don't care for any of the 4 main characters here.Somebody somewhere will do a ""Tenet for Dummies"".Nobody will care to buy it.Once again, worth a see if only to make out how a big guy missed a shot.Here's hoping for the next great one from Nolan",Tenet

It's as if they do not want anyone to be able to pay attention to the dialogue. When action sequences get going you're in for sonic torture. The volume made me cover my ears multiple times. Seriously think I suffered hearing loss from this mess of a movie. I can't speak to the plot because I'm not sure this film has one. I'm certain Nolan understands perfectly what's going on but he didn't bother creating a movie that explains this to the movie goer. Talk about convoluted! The big battle scene at the end had to be important for some reason. I'm just not sure why. To say the story is a bewildering and unpleasant succession of painfully noisy and confusing action scenes is being charitable. I wanted the lead actor to be solid but he's got work to do. Just wasn't buying what he was trying to sell on screen. It's not his fault the movie is so horrific, however.

With a tone of relief he replied ""Thank god I'm not the only one.. I understand precisely nothing.""
We all walked out stunned, amazed and absolutely wanting to see it again.
In the end I had to see it 3 times to get it fully, no shame in that.
Besides a great cast and delightful acting it contains more than one interesting idea and they are implemented very smartly. The story is complex but has strong dramatic moments (which left me teared up in the end) and an intense soundtrack that wonderfully fits the theme of time and twisted physics.Why are people giving bad reviews based on a feeling of insult due to not understanding it instantly? You can research or re-view it you know.How many times have you wished to forget an amazing movie because you wanted to see it again for the first time? This is not exactly that - it is rather a movie you can enjoy multiple times because each time you get it more and more. It's a quality that should not warrant an angry kid's response!I know this isn't a typical review and I am far from a Nolan fanboy. I just read some of the reviews and I couldn't fathom why they gave sometimes 4 or 5 stars.. And the only reason I could read out of their reviews was ""I didn't understand it right away and now I feel stupid which makes me mad."" People simultaneously seem to expect Nolan to blow them away yet under no circumstance should they have to use their brain more than when they watch friends.

Everything is structured so well, the story is amazing, the audio and visuals as always on point, and the casting executes their characters so well. Time and time again (no pun intended), Nolan has been showing us how to turn a great idea into reality. Leave it to the man to overshadow everything typical and predictable thats wrong in cinema nowadays. Tenet will surely keep you on the edge of your seat and you blink at the cost of missing out important details within the movie. It's understandable if an average viewer doesn't understand everything that's going on through their first sitting as I believe this masterpiece requires pretty much advanced understanding and attention as to what's going on. Watch it one, two or more times if you don't understand it. Those who put up bad reviews about this clearly misunderstood what's going on and don't know what they are writing about, and I can't blame them for their low IQ. Outstanding.

It isn't until the second half of the film that it all becomes clear and you understand the true brilliance of what Nolan and his crew have put to the screen.Its hard to keep this review spoiler free because everything about the plot has been hidden and so little has been shown in trailers. While I am not claiming this is the greatest film ever made it certainly is an adequate distraction from the current situation the human race finds itself in.I highly recommend viewing this film in theatres at least once, (even though it will probably take you 2 or 3 viewings to fully grasp all the intricacies like it has for me); I feel like the full experience will be missed if your first viewing is at home like many Nolan films before it.KidKuubrick.",Tenet

The dialogue is intelligible at times. I wondered if it was a dramatic effect at first but it's clearly not. If you were at home you might be inclined to turn up the TV but don't do that, as the score is already causing my ears to bleed. Genuinely....I have no idea how this can happen.
The science fiction element is typical Nolan and is to be enjoyed. The film making is superb but I feel the sci fi is the icing on a really bland cake. The story line, science removed, is a poor James Bond. It looks like a daniel Craig James Bond also.

5020,DistractedMind101,Tenet: a director's film with no clothes,4,5 September 2020,"Crap movie, zero emotional movement, no character development, pointless dialogue. One big spectacle used to hide it's glaring flaws. It's complexity is a farce to hide it's illogical inconsistencies while trying to force the spectator to splash more cash on wasted repeated viewings. It was like the director had zero interest in actually giving the audience a good experience but rather wanted them to admire his ""craft skills"".There was no synchronicity between the protagonist and the plot and zero emotional stakes. Ask yourself this, what actually was driving the main protagonist? Why does it matter to him? You could have replaced the main character with any other personality, flaws, drive and the movie would not have been affected one iota.And the antagonist?!? Tell me again his motivation for causing world war 3? And why did this have to involve inversion again? And what is the use of an antagonist or a protagonist when the latter just literally fights himself just so he can fight himself to stop himself from stopping himself just so he can achieves nothing which somehow allows the protagonist to achieve something which actually doesn't accomplish anything. So the antagonist literally achieved more against himself than the protagonist. So who was whose worse enemy??!? AND tell me again what the protagonist was actually trying to do again? This is what the modern world calls ""deep"".Tenet's ""complexity"" is nothing but a cheap trick to make dumb reviewers and moviegoers applaud a movie at their own expense. Any person with common sense would realise the emperor is wearing no clothes.Why pay for something and fall for a director's clever yet completely egotistical mindgame to make pawns of you and your wallets? This movie spits in the face of all the actually good complex movies of the past that actually had something to say and most importantly elevated it's audience beyond its own medium.

Oh golly.There is far too much left for the audience to assume, let alone given the chance to understand.I defy anybody walking out of a movie theatre to explain the plot to a fellow punter in the way that Nolan intended.The only redeeming quality is that of the production value. There are some genuine cinema firsts.Ignore anybody who says you need multiple viewings to understand the film. They too seem to have missed the point.

5039,johnatrbx,"Polos, Yachts, and World War III",6,5 September 2020,"As a diehard Christopher Nolan fan, I admit, I have a built-in expectations/bias for each of his films. Often high expectations. How can you blame me? From the DK trilogy to Inception to Interstellar they each had a fantastic story and firm characters. Mixed with Hitchcock tension and ocean philosophy, Nolan brings so much to the table. Too much, I fear, to balance properly.As I walked out of the showing, I felt bummed out. Halfway through I was confused as hell. I wondered if my expectations were ungodly high or that the film was truly that bad. 'Tenet' was nothing more than a soulless, teethless blight that tried desperately to make its story look intelligent. The failure was in the basis: the pacing was pressed and rushed; the story was empty and unfinished; and the characters were stale and just plain boring. Washington's character(The Protagonist) had no depth, nothing for the audience to care for, he was just a shell of a potential character. Neil was the only different character, the only I actually enjoyed lmao. Wished he had more chances to be fleshed out. Cat was okay, I didn't quite understand her involvement in the 'Tenet' thing besides being the wife to Kenneth's character. Perhaps I missed something, apologies if I had. I couldn't understand the dialogue most of the time. Also Kenneth's character was confusing. I don't know where to begin.I think most of the money went to Tailors, Bulletproof vests, Yachts, and that 747.The action scenes were spectacular. Nolan did a good job with the direction and style. He's improved greatly. I believe the action scenes will not go forgotten. The only part I actually found entertaining. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is an unfailing wonderment. I daresay it will win an oscar for it. The colors remind me so much of Roger Deakins, but still pertaining to Hoyte's calm undertones. A signiture of his.Ludwig's music was another beauty in this air-filled donut. He's not a Hans Zimmer, mind you. But he does an exceptional job casting tension and uneasiness. I loved it.In my opinion, the film was not the best, but if you enjoy good cinematography and good music, this is your baby.To be short: Christopher Nolan was trying so hard to be Christopher Nolan.PS: Anyone found the sound effects too damn loud?

5040,PingPongTiddly,Not for all - But a genius creation,9,15 January 2021,"I'll admit to start, I am a huge Nolan fan. I love the complexity of his story telling, the thought that goes into his films and the cinematography that runs by its side.There is a lot of criticism for this film, firstly from the actual story and the depth of the plot. The other main complaint is for the sound editing. Now one of these i can 100% agree with, the sound. Like Interstellar (of which I will also confirm is one of my most favorite films) the sound editing is poor. Loud sections moving to low, finds you sat with the remote in hand turning the volume up and down. Similarly I agree there are certain parts of the dialogue (on first viewing) completely incomprehensible. But this is not the important dialogue, it tends to be some aspects of innocuous dialogue that wont give you much context to what you are watching. This is not forgiving it, but putting into perspective that you don't really miss much with these parts.I personally think that Nolan is clever with his dialogue, in particular in this film. Its conversational, casual, relaxed, not over acted. We have to remember that this is not Shakespeare, we aren't watching this for the words alone, this isn't a radio show, but it is for the combination of those words mixed with the cinematography. I believe that people get lost in Nolan's films purely because there is almost an expectation that everyone is ""keeping up"" with what is happening. There is little to no pointless dialogue, only that related to the story. There is no ""lets recap and catch up montage"" style scenes ensuring that the audience is keeping pace. This inevitably means that some viewers 'get lost along the way'! There is no principal of ""no one gets left behind"" in this film. Its a case of watch, pay attention and get lost in the story.I love a film that makes you think and boy does this one make you think. It is intelligent, it is well planned and it is, at times, mind blowing. I've watched this film 4 times now and i still now see aspects of this film which i have never noticed before. As an example, in the final battle scene my 14 year old son said ""the first time i watched this I got confused between who was inverted and who wasn't, then i listened to the music"". He cleverly identified that the inverted fighters are on screen when the score is in reverse and the score normal for those that aren't. It is this attention to detail that is outstanding with Nolan. Its clever, its intentional, its well thought out.The complexity of this film is not for everyone. Not all will get it, not all will like it. But i like my film to be challenging. I think there are too many films which spoon-feed the plot. This, for me, results in a mindless staring at the screen and coming away with a vague degree of satisfaction. You can appreciate the work, you can appreciate the story, but it hasn't challenged you to think. The number of times that we watched this film, pressed pause and debated certain scenes brings a huge pleasure to the film. It makes you think about it even days after seeing it and brings a yearning to see it again which is rarity with many films today. If you look at many of the classic films, those cult classics. They deviated from the norm, made people think and gained attention and focus because of this.My only advice to anyone who is going to watch this, or already has watched it is; give it another chance. Watch it again, focus on the story, focus on the concept and take time to analyze what you have seen. If you want to be spoon-fed, give it a wide berth, you will not like this film.",Tenet

5047,soulburnerboy,Big Budget Comedy Misfire,8,31 August 2020,"This isn't Nolan's best movie - that belongs to the brilliant but ultimately flawed Interstellar. This isn't Nolan's Bond either no matter what other bone-headed reviewers say. This is Nolan's Red Dwarf. Specifically, this is Nolan's 'Backwards' episode of Red Dwarf. The Protagonist (come on Nolan! You couldn't think of a name for this character? Dave Lister maybe?) who should have been the every-man that hooks in the audience - a weakness making Nolan lose his chance to truly engage the audience. His partner, the charming Neil (Robert Pattinson) is Red Dwarf's Cat (with more Hollywood white-washing at work). The slimy, and ultimately childish, Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) (""If I can't have it no-one can!"") is obviously Red Dwarfs Rimmer. The Protagonists drive is to look out for a woman called, ironically, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki) in the same way Lister looked out for Kochansky in Red Dwarf. And Red Dwarfs Kryten would have explained all the time shenanigans better than Nolan did (and in a much shorter time). Injuries coming on before they happened, backwards puddles, birds, fights and talking all came from an episode of Red Dwarf. Nolan just dresses it all up with the 'inverted time' gimmick. Also, as is well known, all the timey-wimey stuff in Tenet was done in-camera with no cgi. Guess what? So was Red Dwarfs. Should Tenet be seen at the cinema? Definitely. Could it be better? Yes, the movie is too po-faced to be great and Nolan forgot to steal the sense of humour from Red Dwarf when he took everything-else.",Tenet

If something in a scene theatrically should make dialogue unintelligible, then I get it, but choosing to make the mix this way for the sake of it is just pretentious.

Now here comes Nolan, every movie movie of his bringing a new title on the top of the list of this genre.The true beauty of this genre that most people who aren't into it don't get is consisted of the layers on which the movie is built. There is the incredible story and then there are the ideas behind. Kat looks at her future self with admiration thinking that she wants to be free like her one day. Let that sink in...
What's happened's happened.. Imagine being already dead while talking to you future past best friend.There were three instances of the same people at the same moment in time in the same place...I get it. This movie doesn't appeal to all. It is about valuing different aspects of movies.

5070,metaswirl,"Deep on the surface, shallow at its core",6,29 August 2020,"Tenet is a fast-paced action movie with Sci-Fi elements. It is driven by great visuals and superb acting, particurlarly by Robert Pattinson (Neil), Elizabeth Debick (Kat) and Dimple Kapadia (Priya). It plays with a different type of time device than usual time-travel movies. Due to this effect the story seems often complex and very sophisticated. In actuality, Tenet moves at such a speed that you have little time to really understand and also question the use of the time device. On leaving the cinema you are likely to be overwhelmed with the many puzzles that the movie throws at you and this can give you the impression that the movie is complex and ""deep"". This impression leads to the artificial divide between insiders who ""just get it"" and the rest. Yet, when you sit down and think about it, it may dawn on you that many of the essential aspects of the time device are just glossed over and many of the scenes do not really add to the movie itself, but just create artificial complexity. If the makers of the movie had spend more time on really showing the limits of the time device, this could have been a much better movie. Instead it suffers from similar fates as many time-travel movies: You are allowed to go back in time to fix things, only if you already did it, which begs the question of how this could have happened in the first place. To this usual dilemma the movie adds many more problems. The largest one is that of all human activity breathing is affected by the time device, while everything else apparently is not.",Tenet

5081,barkinozturk-23821,A Movie Made For The Future,9,30 August 2020,"Before starting, I have to admit one thing. I clearly understand all the criticism and confusiob. The film was quite hard to follow, even for me who is a film student. I will tell you why.Nolan generally sticks to a formula when it comes to his scripts. Characters letting go of their attachments for the greater good. A lot of his movies devote about an hour to exposition and drop almost all of its lore through dialogue. Therefore his past work such as Inception and Interstellar feel like a slow burns that culminate in a third act spectacle. Tenet... is not that.The only genuine flaw I found in this movie was the fact that Nolan did not take his time in the first act. Instead, The Protagonist seemed to appear in one place after another, giving us constant lore drop. While this up-best editing style works within the realms of this movie, it ultimately fails to hook you to the characters like you did to Cobb and Cooper. Constant focus is on the action, except when Miss Debicki appears to add a more human side to the story. But since her conflict is not established in about half an hour like Cobb's was in Inception, it aas harder to connect with her at first.However, this was not an issue once you manage to understand some of the core ideas of this film. I won't be spoiling any of them but Tenet practically is a mixture of Inception, Interstellar and Memento. Whether it be Murpht's Law, manipulating time and space through inversion, or moving back and forward in time simultaneously; the movie really delivers in its scientific aspect. If you are a casual viewer who is used to formulated plotlines, you will not like it. Which brings me to the title of this review.Our minds weren't meant to understand this movie in one go. The concept of ""moving inversely in time"" while others don't is a fairly unique concept. Never been done on this scale. So just like how 2001: A Space Odyssey divided audiences (some say it's a masterpiece, some just can't grasp it), Tenet will not satisfy everyone. It's a very imaginative and futuristic work which was made for the future. When? Who knows. But your understanding of the concepts and character motivationd which are subtely placed will grow with every viewing. So I advice you to see it again. Knowing what will happen, look out for the details. If you manage to see the right things in the frame, you will be surprised.I have to add though. I watched it with subtitles so I have no idea if the mixing was as bad as people make it out to be. I managed to understand some of the important lore drops through subtitles so, not having them could be an issueHope this helps!",Tenet

I had heard such good things. Firstly, and to be honest, I am not the cleverest of fellows, I did not really understand the logic behind the whole thing at all, but I was able to let that go because I know I am a bit of a thicko. I thought it was all a clever idea but the one scene which really annoyed me was the one with the trucks on the road. The whole of this scene was totally unbelievable and utterly stupid - and completely unnecessary. I am pretty certain if I got four of my buddies in a room and we cracked open a few tinnies, we would have had a plausible alternative solution that would have made everyone nod their heads with satisfaction ere the beer ran dry. Hey ho. Kenneth and his wife were mildly disappointing in their acting, but the protagonist and his sidekick came over well. And them the other dumb thing was right at the end. I am pretty certain they said there were 9 thingies, but they split them up between three - and then two - of them - why not (if this is the end of the end of the end of all things if they ever all get together again) give them to 9 complete strangers in different parts of the world at different moments in time, FFS? And the English bloke who was meant to kill them decided not to do so and bugger the consequences. This would not have been so bad if the whole film had not been about not buggering with the consequences. Hey ho. Also, the English bloke was totally bland in his role too.

5088,loddertje,Nolan out-Nolaned himself,4,31 August 2020,"What seems to be an intelligent, thought through and original plot soon shows to be blowing up in its own face. Whereas Nolan usually offers the viewer a guiding light through his ever confusing films, Tenet seems to leave even the most attentive viewer losing the red lining. For example: in Inception the rules of travelling between different dimensions are thoroughly described and displayed. Tenet leaves the explanation of its mysteries to the last few minutes of the over 2,5h movie, and even then it doesn't feel totally fulfilling. There's many, many plot holes. The entire diegesis and its rules raise so many questions that the story loses its reliability and plot progress points lose their worth. Even when there are events that are putting some of the many puzzle pieces together it quickly gets followed up by some more confusing and chaotic scenes. Zero time is offered to overthink and process the information that lies outside the normative understanding of the human mind. It's a shame, really. On paper this plot could really work, but Nolan's execution in my opinion absolutely disappointed.The editing also disappointed me greatly. Most dialogue, which mostly isn't written very well either, uses way to many cuts back and forth the characters. Moreover, the jump cuts that are used sometimes seems off. It's like Nolan's in a rush, but for what? This only enforces the confusing character this film already has.Tenet earned its 4 stars because it does use stunning special effects and cgi. The production team an post-production did do a good job, and the soundtrack seems to be very fitting. If the sound editing would've been done better I would reward the movie with 5 stars (the music and sound effects were too loud and dialogue sounds like mumbling). But a higher rating could only have been if Nolan hadn't out-Nolaned himself.",Tenet

After watching it, I can assure everybody that this movie has been so underrated and many of the audience rated it very low due to the amount of unclear facts in the movie which you have to live with all your senses to absorb and really enjoy the movie.I believe many elements are great in that movie, and If I will pin on the cons in Tenet, I think acting was not the best from the main actor; John Washington, and many other actors would have done a better job.

Basic premise (no spoiler) goes ""mumble mumble .. time travel scenario .. loud music loud music .. something is going to end the world .. mumble mumble .. heroine needs saving .."". Worth a watch for the ' backwards effects ' I guess. Not too bad overall to be fair.",Tenet

Of course, some things make no sense at all, but only from the first glance. I love movies, where you need to think while it lasts, and when it's already finished.I did love Nolan's directing as usually, but has he gone too far with this intellectual stuff? In my opinion, he has not.The plot took my breath away, and I couldn't stop watching the movie. After watching it for the first time, I am still puzzled by certain details. Will have to re-watch it one more time to get a better idea of what the h**l happened :DEven though I liked the soundtrack, the music itself was too loud. That's why it's 9 out of 10.",Tenet

Not your average time travel plot at all, and the build up to the finale is well executed with lots of impressive action set-pieces along the way. Character development is minimal, however, and I'm still not sure what the nice Indian lady had to do with it all. But Edward Cullen does a decent job as a diffident toff, leaving lots of nice little R-Pats on his journey toward/back to self-sacrifice. My chief grumble is that the final battle seems confusing (who the hell is shooting back at the good guys?) and I'd have preferred to see the soldiers moving a bit faster (you know, as if they were actually being shot at). But all-in-all I enjoyed this film. The atmosphere and score is superb and if character development was overlooked it did at least allow for pace and plot. A solid 6.5/10.",Tenet

I felt angry after watching this movie, it is a first. I wanted to be entertained, in stead, I was confused, it even managed to make me feel stupid, because I was unable to follow the events and unable to understand. It was just chaotic.
Furthermore, the choice of the lead actor was ill advised. It was a miscast. It was clear that he was reading his lines without any conviction or depth. As for the character itself, well, a Mary Sue.

But what made it terrible was the audio.After 3/4 way through I needed subtitles on. Never needed to do this before. I didnt get static and was watching on prime on a new 58 inch and i do not have sound issues usually. The problem was that the dialogue was not clear and not pronounced and it was hard to understand what was being said or discussed. the plot was fast paced and the plot moved quickly from each stage so it would have been good for the director to have ensured that those watching could hear properly what was being said.I had to keep rewinding many dialogue parts that extended the time watching by 20 minutes. if i was in a cinema i would have little clue what was said as unable to rewind.If your going to make a film hard to follow, then at least make the dialogue clear to hear and follow!!!",Tenet

5110,tommybyy,Needed to watch twice before reviewing,10,6 September 2020,"On my first viewing of Tenet, I really enjoyed it but I left very confused, overwhelmed, and not fully knowing how to feel. I got the gist of the story but the mechanics of how things were accomplished left me baffled. I already knew I would want to see this multiple times, and after a second viewing I must say I love this film and I think it's fantastic! From a technical standpoint, the movie is near flawless. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score is fantastic (I love how Ludwig incorporates a hip-hop-esque beat at times), and the editing is very well done. I loved the acting all around; everyone gives a great performance. I didn't get some of the inversion elements at first, but the more times you watch the film the clearer it gets. The second half of the film is bonkers and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I've heard many critics say this film is devoid of emotion, and I have to disagree. While not as emotionally resonant as films like Inception and Interstellar, I actually found myself really emotionally affected on second watch. I really bought the commradery of Washington and Pattinson despite most of their friendship being offscreen. The way these actors convey such friendship despite the protagonist not experiencing it yet is phenomenal, and I even teared up at the end when Neil reveals their long friendship before going to sacrifice himself.Despite loving this film, I can't give it a 10/10 right now for a few reasons. For starters, some exposition scenes in the beginning, while necessary, feel really clunky at times. Also, I agree with most that the sound mixing makes it hard to hear dialogue at times, though I didn't find it as bad on my second viewing and I don't think it'll be a problem on the blu-ray. I'd say my biggest issue with the film right now is that while I think the second half is absolutely phenomenal, I just wasn't as into the first half. There are parts in the first half I love (plane crash, inverted fight, kitchen fight) and I was still engaged, but I just wasn't feeling the first half the way I was feeling the second half.Overall, I think Tenet is a really great film that can be enjoyed as a cerebral puzzle or just outright spectacle. I think this film gets better and better the more you watch it and I have a feeling that years from now it will be looked at much more positively than it is now (similar to The Prestige). While it's not my favorite of Nolan's filmography (not yet at least), I absolutely recommend this and I can't wait to see it many more times in the future.",Tenet

5114,realranie,Great but confusing at times,7,28 August 2020,"It's been a while since I saw a movie in theaters (last time was Sonic the Hedgehog), so it was a great time to see one in the big screen again. I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and in my opinion, it didn't disappoint. Though I would say it is not his best movie (My favorites are The Dark Knight & Inception).I like the main concept in this movie, I love the visual effects and lot of it reminds me of Inception. I like the main character (played by John David Washington), though the rest of characters are rather okay. I think the plot is interesting, but I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into details here.The plot is interesting, but I think the movie is a little bit difficult to follow at times. So many things happens at once, and if you look away from the movie for a tiny second, you might miss a important plot point. The plot can be a little bit confusing, but I understood most of it. I think I should one day rewatch the movie to fully understand it.Despite the plot being confusing at times, I enjoyed the movie. It's not Nolan's best, but if you're looking for something similar to Inception, give this movie a watch. (Just don't have high expectations)",Tenet
5115,yashabyadav,From the perspective of a Physics Student.,7,4 December 2020,"First things first. if you are deciding to watch this movie or not then here's a quick overview.*You should watch this movie if/when*
1) You love the close to reality depiction physics/ science in movies.
2) You are looking for something more than just laid back entertainment.
3) You have time and patience to rewind watch certain scenes multiple times.
4) You are saturated with time traveling movies and looking for something refreshing in the genre.
5) You are willing to watch it again if you don't get it the first time (most likely you won't unless you have an IQ of 180)* Don't watch this movie if/when*
1) You are looking for some laid back entertainment without using your head too much.
2) have watched limited movies in the sci-fi genre. (particularly time travel)
That being said, here's what I, a physics student thinks of this.* Beyond this point, there might be spoilers, so you have been warned*Without a doubt, this movie is thought provoking. And the thing that blows my mind is I tried so hard to find some legit flaws to the science of movie but failed. The action of this movie is marvelous. Hats-off to the makers for pulling it off.BUTthis movie is not for everyone. See, it really gives me immense pleasure that sci-fi is giving real life insights to physics phenomenon, but at the end of the, a movie is supposed to be entertaining. For example, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the most thought provoking sci-fi movie I have ever seen, but, it was boring. How entertaining a movie is the biggest factor to its success and how the audience receives it.Sure this movie has given insight to a different form of time travel by violating the most fundamental law of thermodynamics, but it was confusing af (I am gonna have to rewatch it).",Tenet

I'll be advising myself and all I with whom I speak to avoid purchasing your movies, I'll wait for the streaming service. At least that way I won't feel like I've wasted time AND money, just time.As an aside, this is a growing concern with the modern film industry, please don't attempt to give me tinnitus with your sound effects and music unless you can learn to do basic sound mixing.

I've seen the movie in IMAX, which I recommend to everyone. Very impressive experience.I think this movie is certainly not for everyone.

The concepts he is exploring are too complex to grasp for a common viewer (or a licensed scientist). I am not sure if a degree in physics or some related field would be sufficient to get the plot fully.Main villain story is just lazy, and his motivation to destroy the world, I am just gonna say it, is idiotic. Characters are not developed at all, he just focused on the story.Long story short, I dont want to be forced to learn a new field of physics every time his movie comes out. Inception was fun, same as Memento, because concepts were more or less easy to follow, but this movie is just not worth it.Worst thing of all: people are giving it rating 8 or 9. I am pretty sure its because they couldnt follow the story and see the nonsense he gave us in this movie, but to afraid to admit it.",Tenet
5131,timotterbeck,Classic Action Thriller packed in a Rubik Cube,4,1 September 2020,"Well, where to start. I like it when movies try to outsmart their viewers and I really admire Nolan for his work in Inception, The Dark Knight, Prestige etc. But this movie felt like even Nolan himself was not so eager doing it properly. The production and the editing felt rushed. Especially in the beginning. Character introduction happens in a blink of an eye. The main plot not comprehensible because the audio was so roughly mixed that the music and the SFX felt like little explosions in your head while the spoken world happens under a thick layer of ice. The music was...well was there real music after all? Compared to the magnificent work of Zimmer in Interstellar or Inception this here was just generic modern Drone elements where even Sunn o))) would not be pleased with. The story itself (not the physical background on which this whatever is based on) was kinda predictable since the half of the movie. But what buggers more is the dull story itself: Rich warlord with cancer is not able to get his marriage properly so he just wants to destroy the world. The characters all were one sided without any emotions attached. Even emotional scenes felt just bleak. Nolan can do this so much better (Interstellar did this masterfully). And why cast an Irish actor for a russian villain whereas there are many awesome eastern european actors out there?All in all this movie felt too much cliché and more like a cheap rip off of Nolans previous work. This just felt nothing at all like the work of our well beloved master of modern cinema. This is just a movie without any soul attached to it.",Tenet
5132,ryanlegrand,A technical prowess with dumb stakes,7,17 September 2020,"For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I kept thinking to myself ""This is nice but I'll never want to see this again"". The dialogues felt rushed, the characters uninteresting.Then come the core of the movie, the whole pitch that makes it work. The scene that reveals the genius mechanics of reversed time. It's brillant, mind bending, coherent, visually stunning, I loved it, I was hooked, I knew I was in for my money and I enjoyed every single second.After this brillant piece of work came more downtime, where way too much time is allowed for the sadly written Kat, she removes, by herself, 2 stars from this masterpiece. All of her lines are boring and simplistic, I even caught myself laughing out loud at one of her lines because it felt so un-spontaneous and dumb.This incoherent rythm keeps on going for the end of the movie, you are in turn breathless, then bored to tears by the simplistic dialogues. If it weren't for the brilliant handling of ""Time"", this would be a terrible movie. The stakes at play are extremely basic, they somehow make it work, but I would have expected more from a Nolan movie.It's brilliant and revolutionnary in many aspects of filmmaking. For this, I enjoyed it, a lot, and I will watch this movie again. However, the story feels rushed, you can clearly see that much of the thinking went into the brilliant handling of intertwined/reverted scenes, not that much in the story itself, that disappointed me.It's a great entertainment, not the greatest story.",Tenet
5133,amalieredmond,Makes sense and gets better with second watch,8,13 September 2020,"So, after coming back from the cinema from watching Tenet for the first time, I was feeling such a buzz but at the same time if somebody had asked me (which they did..) what was it about, I would have just had to answer: no idea. Second time watching, it was so much clearer. The time inversion, going backwards and forwards makes sense and is logical. In fact, it's very cleverly thought out. Christopher Nolan does it again in that he makes something that just should not work actually make sense. You just have to give it time. And preferably watch it with subtitles. Just like a lot of his films, not only does it makes you want to talk about it, think up theories but it's also a great cinema experience.As for the rest of it, again typical Nolan. The music was so effective, it made me jump up in my seat with the tension of it along with the great directing. There were a lot of great shots (I mean seriously, wow), very spectacular scenes and the cinematography was on point. The acting was good even though it was less about the characters and more an ensemble piece/plot driven. Despite people having problems with the muffled dialogue, it personally didn't affect me.All in all, I would definitely recommend people to watch this film; the first watch for the amazing look and thrill of it and the second watch for the clever plot.Very good 8/10",Tenet

5141,Keyarchan,A masterpiece with some sound issues,9,7 September 2020,"Many reviews here suggest you watch it twice to enjoy it but I personally found it awesome in just the one viewing(though I am looking forward to watching it a second time). It most likely helped that I was already fascinated by the concept of time to begin with and therefor might've understood parts of it better.
The movie is a bit complicated for sure, there are moments in the movie you won't understand until later, which I personally liked.
The acting was superb, both Robert Pattinson and John David Washington did a great job on it and so did the other actors, not much more to say.
One thing I particularly liked were the small details, like how they played with the soundtrack during certain parts(don't want to spoil).The one and only complaint I have, which I really hope is fixed in the blu-ray version, is the sound, which is the reason I didn't give the movie a 10.
I'm not talking about the soundtrack, which was great, but the volume of it. It was way way too loud so it was hard to hear what they were saying half the time and at my cinema the bass was so loud that it ""cracked"" frequently and made the whole room vibrate.
Luckily, I live in a foreign country and had subtitles which I generally don't read during english speaking movies but in this case was a necessity.
The issues with the sound is also the reason I won't watch the movie at the cinema a 2nd time but instead wait for it to be released on blu-ray or streaming.I highly recommend seeing it if you're looking for an intelligent movie with a heavy sci-fi theme that makes you focus.
But if you're looking for a brainless action movie or just have a low attention span then this movie might not be for you as it can be a bit confusing at time.",Tenet

5150,debirukun,"The difference between ""movies"" and ""films""",10,5 September 2020,"Just got home from watching Tenet. Without giving too much away, there is a German Netflix series called Dark, that shares some similarities to this film. One cannot fathom writing such a complex tale, and then conceptualise it on Film. Dark just barely wraps up all the storylines and character arcs in its 3 serie/season run.To think someone could encapsulate such an ambitious 26 episode series into one film is beyond incredible! Christopher Nolan does it in 2 hours and 30 minutes! He is a visual storyteller for the ages. His pacing and storytelling style rival Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Fellini and Godard.There are certain plot holes, and dues ex machinas to be sure. However Mr. Nolan does not give the audience a chance to ponder as he carries you through the narrative with the speed of an M60 machine being emptied by a screaming John Rambo! RaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! But I digress, Mr. Nolan carries you through the narrative without any obligatory or extemporaneous cues to the audience that lesser formulaic films always do by the mandate of the Hollywood Executives.Given the gravitas of his film portfolio, He now has the power and freedom to tell stories the way he wants to, without the influence of the Hollywood system, that demands films to be dumbed down to movies with a healthy dose of forced romance, and bad CGI prescribed to the general populace.In my humble opinion, it's as if Christopher Nolan is literally telling the audience. YOU ARE SMART! FIGURE IT OUT! And I F**KING LOVE IT!!I'm quite chuffed an Englishman is creating such an original voice in cinema, without flashy gimmicks, or unnecessary eye candy to ensnare the audience's attention.
One could argue his high concept special FX are gimmicky. Consider that any FX used in his films always serve a purpose, to drive the story forward in stead of detract or distract from it.Anywho, as you can tell, I loved this film! There was a few people that walked out of the theatre half way. I can understand how the musical score and intensity of some scenes may be too much and too difficult to follow and absorb. However if you enjoy films that challenge you, and allow you to put the pieces together just as the main protagonist does. Then you will love this film.On a side note: John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Kenneth Branagh's performances were outstanding! John comes into his own out of the shadow of his famous father. However I did see that Denzel swagger and cadence in some scenes that are simply genetic. I am thoroughly impressed by Robert Patttinson, with his previous film The Lighthouse. He truly a gifted young actor. I'm looking forward to his turn as Bruce Wayne. I wish him a speedy recovery,.",Tenet
5151,hastwow,Masterpiece - In deep Story explanation below - read if you have lots of question marks!,10,4 May 2021,"Since the movie is non linear in the time - I will start with a Theory before explaining the movie. I call it Theory since it is indicated in the movie but not shown or really explained.Theory: The protagonist is living through the happenings in the movie and understands that they can stop the full entropy of time if he and his partner Neil (Pattison) just have to make sure that everything happens exact the same way. After the movie the protagonist is founding Tenet, which is a Group/Army specialized to keep everything exactly like it happens in the movie to stop doomsday.Movie: protagonist is in the opera on a special mission - he gets saved by Neil. He passes the test and becomes part of Tenet. He trys to stop the antagonist, who is collecting 9 pieces of a device which can ""change the direction of time"" (lets call it entropy of time from now on) of the whole world. This would lead to the total anhilation of the (current) humanity. This device is from the future.Later it is known that due to the current generation the world is not the same anymore for the future generation. The water levels are up, rivers drought etc. Since they don't believe in the ""grand father paradoxon"" the future generation decides to anhilate the past (current) generation. They believe that they will still exist even if the current generation is wiped out.There is one scientific breakthrough in the future with the time entropy, which allows people to live the time backwards. With the help of this technology they contact the antagonist (which will get cancer when he is old) and make a deal with him. He should build together the machine which will destroy the whole humanity. For ""betraying"" his own (current) generation the future is giving him incredible amounts of gold and he can choose the time when the full time entropy should happen.To be able to do this he has to collect all 9 parts of the machine which was send back from the future.The first part of the machine he is finding during the clean up work in his hometown - this is also the place where the war in the end is happening. With the first part together there is also an letter which is explaining him everything (I guess).I will not go to much in the detail for every small thing happening in the movie but there are two things to consider:
1) The device is connected to his pulse. If his pulse is gone it will automatically be activated.2) The device is only completed after the Protagonist joins Tenet (important)
3) Neil get recruited by the protagonist in the future and obviously he is the guy who help open the doorI am a big Noland fan and I was disappointed after first watching Tenet. Not 1 Star disappointed but like 6-7 Stars. It is extremely hard to follow and every moment is important.After the 2nd watching I realized just how clever everything is and all assumed plot holes after the first time where completely gone.This is the most intelligent and fascinating movie which was ever produced - it is ahead of its time.It is a true Nolan - but you don't go out of the movie theater like in interstellar, dark knight or inception and think ""wow that was a great movie"". You need time to understand the theory and logic behind the movie, let some time pass and watch it again.10/10.",Tenet
5152,stevewhite16,"Terrible sound, mediocre movie",4,9 September 2020,"Most people won't like this film due to the horrible sound. Many people were covering their ears at times, or putting in ear buds. Most people couldn't hear significant patches of the dialogue. I'm just glad I didn't take my wife, who is not a native English speaker. She would have just left the theater. Personally, I gave up after 2/3rds and considered leaving. If you ask the people working at the theater they will probably explain that you are not the only one complaining. I'm spending most of the review on the sound because it is the main thing you will think about when you leave the theater.If you're the kind of person who thinks movies provide deep insight into metaphysics then you'll love this one. If you're either too dumb or too smart for that then you'll be slightly irritated by the plot which vacillates between predictable and incoherent.When the movie is released on digital download and someone fixes the sound or you can watch with subtitles it'll be a solid gentleman's B.",Tenet

It was obviously a movie aimed at pompous intellectuals who stand around drinking expensive wine and debating papers they have written on sexual identity. Sadly that is not me!

5160,shashuhr,Massive Nolan fan but didn't live up to his usual movies,5,11 September 2020,"I a huge Nolan nut. I have watched interstellar, inception, prestige, the dark knight many many times and I still enjoy them thoroughly. Tenet got me excited for 2020 but it is missing one key thing.... rooting for the protagonist. In interstellar I loved Mathews relationship with his daughter which drew us closer to him and wanted him to succeed at every turn. In inception we sympathize with DiCaprio due to his fatal mistake of unintentionally killing his wife causing us to go on the journey of how hard it was for him to move on. In prestige we either rooted for bale or hugh because we sympathize with Hugh for bale killing his wife. But we also sympathize with bale for his lack of finance despite his extreme talent. Finally tenet.... it was vapid. The ""protagonist"" has no driving goals to win. He just wants to to stop the antagonist just for the sake of. Then we kind of feel his love for kat but that too fizzles off. We have no reason to root for him. No emotion in the protagonist causes a 3 rd person perspective on the movie instead of a 1 st person perspective taking the journey with the protagonist instead of looking at him going through it. Adding to this the half baked science of time inversion by reversing entropy which is not at all how time works but ok I'll let that go. It does have the signature Nolan ending where everything makes sense in the end and the amazing visuals. But like I mentioned no emotions throughout. I fell asleep in the middle that's how bad it was. If you want to just watch a decent spy movie with half baked science fiction crazy visuals and typical satisfying Nolan ending watch it",Tenet
5161,kkmathews-96640,"A treat, but not the best of Nolan",6,13 December 2020,"Usually with Nolan, once you take the effort to peel the layers there is always a gem inside.... Unfortunately the effort taken to peel the layers seems to be gem in Tenet.The movie could have been made in a far less confusing manner. Once you figure out the story and its timeline (i hope i got it!)... there is no joy in that discovery.... just an exhausted feeling that the complexity was there just for the sake of it... There is no breath-taking moment like that of The Prestige, or the awed feeling of Inception and Momento or the magic of Dunkirk and the perfection in Dark Knight trilogy. Tenet is technically perfect... though the background score takes centrestage at times.But just like it is for Nolan fans i too just loved it all the three times!",Tenet
5162,keeperben,"Tenet, Nolan's best movie since inception",9,26 August 2020,"As a 15 year old kid who's love for film increases for every day Nolan has knocked it out the park again with another masterpiece that I would put above most of his other projects. The cinematography is gorgeous and every shot tells a story its self without having to have dialogue. This is not a story where you can sit back and relax because if you miss any details then this could cause you to get confused and without much exposition this movie will confuse the audience if they aren't paying attention. The back and fourth between Pattinson and Washington is entertaining and there relationship expands through out the movie and every central character is fleshed out enough so we can care about them and fear for there lives. If I had one criticism about the movie, it would be that Branagh's characters motives are clear but they are not understandable. Without spoiling anything, his characters motives feel like Nolan just needed a way to get a villain into the movie and just gave him an evil master plan that didn't really make much sense except show the character was just plain evil. But that's my only problem with the movie and everything else is Nolan at his best, with outstanding action sequences and amazing performances from the leads.

It will have you rushing to YouTube for those breakdown videos to help make sense of it all. Although as you watch for the second time it's easier on the mind and you start to piece everything together better and after that is a much better watch, if I say anymore I will probably spoil it.

Terrible background music/noise drowned out much of the dialogue.

The acting, in fairness, was ground breaking and redefined the entire 'tediously vapid and emotionally vacuous' genre without working up a sweat. A remarkable achievement. As was the superbly delineated unpredictable sociopath with a Russian accent. The plot? Who knows? Who cares? I certainly did not and spent much of the 150 minutes reminding myself to tell my lungs to breathe occasionally as my subconscious had obviously decided that humanity had no future and it was pointless carrying on. I would have left early but I am one of nature's optimists and expected the cavalry, in the form of a script editor, to pop up at any minute to inform the audience that the film was an elaborate hoax designed to test just how far one could take the 'emperor has no clothes' motif before the public cottoned on.

Because of the concept of inversion you'll set your eyes on things you have never seen before in any movie or series. That is also one of the many aspects that make Tenet a very special movie and a real experience, and an experience you will definitely want to experience again.
