0,MartinHafer,There's a lot to love...and a lot to hate.,5,27 October 2020,"Neither Addams Family movies of the 1990s were like the old television series. While the 1960s show was cute and funny, the movies are very dark and present a different sort of family. In the original, you know that despite all the goofiness, the family never would really harm anyone and they truly love each other. Here in the movies, all bets are off! The family is dangerous...having murdered someone at the end of the first film. Here in the second, the film begins with many attempted murders. As soon as the Addams' third child is born, Wednesday and Pugsly begin trying to kill the infant because they are jealous...and I was horrified at this. While it's supposed to be darkly humorous, I felt it was completely cruel and awful...and definitely NOT the sort of movie I'd ever let kids watch. Now the film did improve greatly when the parents send Pugsly and Wednesday to camp...there were many clever and funny moments. But still, I could not get my head around them trying to murder a baby!! To me, this makes the film one that is, overall, a failure. Had they worked on making it funny all the time, it would have been a delight. As it is, it's really a pretty nasty movie.",Addams Family Values
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Very funny, possibly better than the first!",9,22 February 2009,"I absolutely loved the first movie. I bought this two days ago, and I was really impressed, because this is a really funny movie. it is possibly better than the first but only just. If there are any flaws, they are minor, but why is the rating for this movie so low? 6.2? It is much better than that! I can name other great movies that have fallen victim to low ratings. The humour was wonderful. Black humour suits the Addams Family perfectly. As for the acting, it was superb. Christina Ricci tops them all as Wednesday, but that doesn't mean that the others weren't good either. Raul Julia and Angelica Huston are note perfect as Gomez and Morticia. To be honest, I think that Gomez is Julia's best role. Christopher Lloyd was born to play Fester, just as entertaining as he was in Back To The Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Jimmy Workman was also really good, and the underrated actress Joan Cusack took me completely by surprise as Debbie. That baby was cute too. If there was one minor flaw, it would be that you don't see much of Cousin It and Margaret. As I'm probably not able to write a review for the first film, what I've said for this film, applies pretty much also for that too. I give this a 9/10, same with the first, but avoid the New Addams Family and unless you're a Tim Curry fan, avoid Addams Family Reunion also. 9/10. Bethany Cox",Addams Family Values
2,Leofwine_draca,Superior sequel,6,12 November 2015,"I didn't think much of the original ADDAMS FAMILY film with Angelica Huston and Raul Julia; it's one of those 1990s films which feels really dated when you look back on it, more so than films from previous decades. In fact, I thought it was an unfunny, over-directed mess, so how would this sequel - which brings back the entire cast as well as director Barry Sonnenfeld - hold up? The good news is that this is a definite improvement over the first film. It's actually funny in places. Sonnenfeld was a first time director on THE ADDAMS FAMILY and ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES was his third film, and he already makes the whole thing feel a lot more effortless, without a lot of the gimmicky camera tricks. There are still annoyances, like that darned light shining in Huston's eyes all the while, but this is a step up.The plotting is also more apparent here, and newcomer Joan Cusack makes a real impression as the gold digger come in to seduce Uncle Fester (an increasingly funny Christopher Lloyd). Some of the gags are deliciously dark, especially those involving danger towards baby newcomer Pubert, and the sub-plot involving Wednesday and Pugsley going to summer camp (where they encounter a typically irritating Peter MacNicol) is a hoot.",Addams Family Values
3,SnoopyStyle,love the summer camp,8,17 October 2014,The Addams Family is back. Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) have a new baby. Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are playing a little too dangerously with the baby. They hire Debby Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) as the new nanny. Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) is immediately enchanted. Only she's actually a serial killer called 'The Black Widow'. Wednesday gets suspicious of her. Debby tricks the family into sending the kids to summer camp. Meanwhile she searches for hidden family treasure and tries to hook her next victim Fester.The kids playing is hilarious. Christina Ricci is especially funny with her dead pan humor. Sending them to summer camp is a stroke of genius. They are fish out of water and that's why it's even funnier. The adults are slightly less funny. They don't have the same fish out of water storyline. It's not a big problem. They're still funny.,Addams Family Values
4,mark.waltz,"Yes, yes, a sequel even crazier and better than the original!",7,19 May 2015,"Now that the Addams family have gotten the whole is Fester really Fester issue out of the way, they can go on with their lives, and now that there's a baby, they've got another issue: the other children want the baby dead! Gomez and Morticia decide to get a nanny (a child sitter, not a goat, to paraphrase Ricky Ricardo), and like the Von Trapp children (but in a more demonic way), Pugsly and (especially) Wednesday come up with clever ways of getting rid of each one, more foolish than the one before. When one European lady comes in with a puppet, it's not surprising that Wednesday has a puppet of her own, and it ain't close to Lambchops. Then in walks Joan Cusack, the cheery, blonde beauty with a perfect response to every question, yet all too perfect to be trusted. The film switches cleverly into two subplots as Cusack has Pugsly and Wednesday sent off to summer camp while she plots a way to win Uncle Fester's heart so she can cook his hide to get her grubby little paws on his fortune and Pugsly and Wednesday deal with the freaky ""normal"" people they encounter at camp as only an Addams can.""I'm not perky"", Ricci says as Wednesday, after sitting through Disney movies and every family musical ever made, smiling evilly which sends one obnoxious little blonde girl into hysterics. Of course, she earlier got the better of them too when she adds her own twist to a ghost story that is every little rich girl's fear, already having failed to jump into the water to save the ""little miss perfect"" from drowning during a life-saving course. Peter MacNichol and Christine Baranski are delightfully obnoxious as the cheerful but snooty moderators of the summer camp, treating each blue eyed/blonde haired boy and girl as if they were the second coming of Christ and any one else as freaks of nature. It's up to Pugsly, Wednesday and their nerdy friend (David Krumholtz) to turn the tables on this group of freaky up-scales so they can rush back and save Fester from a fate worse than life.The Addams kids rule in this sequel with Gomez and Morticia slightly more in the background in spite of a hot dance sequence in a restaurant that looks like a cave. Joan Cusack is a delightful villain, with Lloyd hysterical as Uncle Fester trying to impress her with his walrus impression. (I hope she hadn't planned on eating those bread-sticks...) Carol Kane takes over the role of Grandma Addams, getting in a few witty lines here and there, highly reminding me of Jackie Hoffman's portrayal of Grandma in the Broadway musical version. Speaking of that, there's a delightful surprise cameo by none other than the future Gomez of Broadway himself, Nathan Lane, playing ironically a police officer who encounters Gomez and Morticia while they're trying to save Fester. I wasn't sure if it was the fact he was in this or playing a police officer that was more of a surprise. Broadway veteran Harriet Harris is also present as the snobbish mother of the perky but obnoxious child whom Ricci makes sure has a delightful come-uppance in the Thanksgiving Day musical play MacNichol and Baranski put on at camp. When Ricci adds in her own two cents for the treatment of the Indians, it added a lot of intelligent humanity to her somewhat devilish character. Of course, she won me over in the first film when she was selling lemonade and asked the girl scout if her cookies were made out of real girl scouts and told another little girl in the hospital that it wasn't the stork that brought her a new sibling, it was the fact that her parents had sex. Watching Ricci get even with the type of kids that made a lot of other kids miserable throughout their school years is poetic justice indeed, especially if it warns those like these twit-wits that this, too, could happen to you! Then, there's the camp counselors who may smile, laugh, jump and sing, but are as racist and perhaps even more evil than the Addams could ever think of being. In many ways, this isn't only better than the original, it's even twice as fun. There's a sense of dark comedy here that might raise eyebrows of audiences looking for good, clean fun, but as I stated in my review of the first movie, it's all innocent and a creative take on the original T.V. series and comic books. It's also sad, being one of Raul Julia's last films, and reminded me of the memory of the original Morticia (Carolyn Jones) who continued to work up almost until her death while fighting cancer on the daytime soap opera ""Capitol"". Dana Ivey returns, now Mrs. Cousin It Addams, with a little hairy bundle of joy. There's a delightfully sick but funny gag involving Lurch and the huge cake for Fester's bachelor party, and the finale scene with Ricci and Krumholtz might result in the viewer having the spit-take to end all spit-takes.",Addams Family Values
5,lee_eisenberg,It should be the value of any family to see this movie if possible.,10,26 September 2005,"""Addams Family Values"" accomplishes what ""The Godfather, Part II"" did: it equals, if not outdoes, the original. In this case, Morticia (Anjelica Huston) has a baby - whom they name Pubert (you read that right), Fester (Christopher Lloyd) marries nanny Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) and Gomez (Raul Julia) decides that Wednesday and Pugsley should spend the summer at a camp.The best parts of the movie are the scenes at the camp. Run by airheads Gary (Peter MacNicol) and Becky Granger (Christine Baranski), the whole camp is an excuse for airhead rich white kids to act nice to each other and perform a play about the original Thanksgiving. If there are any ethnic people...well, they can be dealt with. But that's all going to change now that Wednesday and Pugsley have arrived.Anyway, ""Addams Family Values"" is a movie that everyone should see. I certainly recommend it to everyone. You just never stop laughing, especially when you hear what Fester says after Debbie gives him a present.",Addams Family Values
6,jboothmillard,Addams Family Values,8,24 March 2005,"This is the sequel to the film based on the comedy horror TV series. Golden Globe nominated Anjelica Huston returns Morticia Addams and Raul Julia as Gomez Addams. They now have Uncle Fester (brilliantly cast Christopher Lloyd) living with them. But it isn't long before Fester meets a beautiful woman that he wants to be with. I can't remember all of it but the film is mainly focused on Fester living with this awful woman. I think they get married and she keeps trying to kill him, but that's the comedy of it, he always survives. Also starring young Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams, Jimmy Workman as Pugsley Addams, Peter MacNicol as Gary Granger, Nathan Lane as a Desk Sergeant and even the director, Barry Sonnenfeld appears as Mr. Glicker. A very good comedy horror from the director of The Mummy. Christopher Lloyd is the highlight of the whole film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration, and it was nominated the BAFTA fro Best Make Up Artist. Very good!",Addams Family Values
7,ccthemovieman-1,Funny Sequel With An Evil Message,6,18 March 2006,"Just the title of this movie tells you that ""family values"" are going to be trashed. It plays up evil, as opposed to goodness, but most of it is strictly to get laughs. In all, it's a funny sequel to the first Adams Family film, very inventive and slightly more entertaining than the first film.The special effects aren't the only highlight of this comedy. You expect that from this kind of story, but I was pleasantly surprised how much the sound added to the entertainment, especially n the first half of the film.The first half is better all-around because the second half has touches of mean- spiritedness entering the picture, not just humor. The message that evil is cool and wholesomeness is stupid gets carried away and is overdone. Yes, the camp counselors are very funny but too stupid as the filmmakers use them to bad-mouth good values.That's basically the message from today's filmmakers: evil is good and good is evil. Wrap that up in a good comedy and your message gets accepted more readily. Too bad they got carried away because this movie has many funny scenes.",Addams Family Values
8,Tweekums,Even better than the first film,9,8 December 2010,"As a general rule sequels are rarely better than the original but I think this one is; little time is wasted introducing the characters and soon the family is one larger thanks to the birth of baby Pubert. Wednesday and Pugsley are not impressed with the new arrival and soon set about trying to kill him! Gomez and Morticia decide that the children need a nanny but all the applicants are frightened of the children; that is until Debbie arrives. Debbie seems too good to be true; she is not scared of the children and Fester takes an immediate liking to her it is just a shame that she is wanted for murdering her previous husbands on their wedding nights and wants to do the same with Fester. When Wednesday sees through her deviousness she and her brother are packed off to summer camp where they are expected to be happy children and join in the various activities; this leads to a delightful reinterpretation of the Thanks Giving story.This film was better than the first largely because Christina Ricci had a significantly larger role; Wednesday is creepy in just about every scene she is in especially when she tried to smile! The story was more interesting too, having two main stories, Fester's problems with Debbie and the children's time at the camp, meant neither outstayed its welcome. Once again Raul Julia, Angelica Huston and Christopher Lloyd did a fine job as Gomez, Morticia and Fester and Joan Cusack who played Debbie managed to switch from delightful to demented in an enjoyable way.",Addams Family Values
9,Coventry,More eccentric and ingenious morbidity...Hooray!,9,28 April 2004,"You definitely can't blame this sequel of being an uninspired, repetitive copy of the original! The entire family and their delightfully extravagant behavior returns, but the situations in ""The Addams Family"" Values"" are of a much wider range. The family comes into contact with the outside world in this film, which results in an even more effective satire/black comedy. Gomez and Morticia welcome a new brat, uncle Fester falls in love with a dangerously disturbed serial killer (magnificently played by Joan Cusack) and the offspring is sent to Summer Camp! The sequences where the joy-joy camp leaders try to bring some color into the lives of Wednesday and Pugsley are downright hilarious. The jokes and situational humor in this sequel are constantly on the same (high) level as the original, while cast and crew obviously had a lot of fun. Of course, it would never have been this great if the initial cast wouldn't have returned as a wholesome. The group of actors fit together perfectly and the chemistry between them is almost natural. Once again a special mention for Christina Ricci, who's the loveliest little witch in the history of cinema. Both films are comedy efforts to watch over and over again! Preferably in pair!",Addams Family Values
10,poolandrews,"""You'll meet someone, someone very special, someone who won't press charges."" Good sequel.",7,1 January 2007,"Addams Family Values starts with the news that Morticia (Angelica Huston) is about to give birth, she does & everyone including the Father Gomez (Raul Julia) are very excited. However their two children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) feel threatened by the new arrival & to add to the families problems Debbie (Joan Cusak) the nanny that they hire tricks Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) into marrying her & she plan's to kill him for his money...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld Addams Family Values is a worthy sequel to the original Addams Family (1991) & a good watch in it's own right. The script by Paul Rudnick takes the usual standard social situations & twisting them into a ghoulish gag, joke or set-piece & there's plenty here to smile at. While I didn't find any of it laugh out loud hilarious I found it consistently amusing, it runs for 90 odd minutes & it moves along at a nice pace, there's enough happening to keep one entertained for it's duration. All the usual character's are there & well represented, the dialogue is good & the story is also pretty good.Director Sonnenfeld does a good job, there's that fantastic morbid atmosphere running through the film & the Addams Gothic mansion looks the business.Technically the film is very well made & has great production design & it has that big budget Hollywood look about it. The acting was good & the cast bring the character's to life.Addams Family Values is a good film, it's pretty morbid when it wants to but it also has that dark comedic edge as well. What more can I say, it's well worth a watch.",Addams Family Values
11,Calicodreamin,The cast 🙌🏽,8,11 April 2020,"Everything about the Addams family movies is the casting, each actor plays their character so well it's hard not to love these movies. The storyline is well developed, the acting impeccable, and the cinematography perfect. I love the camp takeover scene with Ricci as Pocahontas, never fails to make me laugh. Overall just a mindless good time with the Addams family.",Addams Family Values
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Better than the first, a truly hilarious black comedy",7,16 July 2004,"While the first Addams Family had a few problems, mainly in the script and plot, this one is almost entirely flawless. Whereas the first has a tiresome, almost cliché-like plot, this one has a far more original and interesting approach to the Addams'. I guess it is a little lame that it, once again, mainly revolves around Fester, but that's the only thing I can think of as far as negative thoughts toward this masterpiece of black comedy goes. Nearly all of the actors who were in the first film reprise their roles in this one. All of the main characters are played by the same actors, and they do a just as good job as they did in the first. I would probably say that Christoper Lloyd as Fester even did a better job than he did in the first, but that may just be that his character is written better in this one. Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman each give as great a performance as they did last; Christina is even more chilling in this, and once again gives a magnificent and scary performance in this, once again proving how talented she is(she was 12 or 13 when they made this). Joan Cusack is a great addition to the cast, providing some great wacky comic relief, which is a welcome view on the actress that yours truly had only experienced in the wretched series ""What About Joan"". I also very much enjoyed the other new character, Pubert. He brought in a lot of good new gags and jokes. There were also some reoccurring gags and jokes more or less reused from the first film, but none of them seemed unoriginal. The film is about as eventful as the first, possibly more. The plot is great, much more original than the first one. It has a good pace, you're never bored. The acting is as flawless as it was in the first, possibly better. The characters are very well-written, better than in the first. Morticia still looked like a clown, but at least she did the walk better this time around. Gomez was still flesh-colored, but Fester achieved a consistent paleness. All in all, a great black comedy, and a very worthy sequel to the first. One of the few sequels that surpasses the first film. I recommend it to fans of the actors, as this is them at their best, fans of black comedy, and anyone who enjoyed the first film. 7/10",Addams Family Values
13,view_and_review,Funnier and Better than the First,8,24 June 2020,"If the only scene I saw from ""Addams Family Values"" was the Thanksgiving play, then that would've been enough for me. It was so hilarious and on point. Wednesday (Christina Ricci) was pitch perfect as the radical American Indian.Yes, yes, the main plot of Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) trying to kill Fester (Christopher Lloyd) for his money was good as well, but once Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday were in day camp and had to mingle with all the Stepford children, that became the movie for me.",Addams Family Values
14,Aaron1375,I found the sequel a slightly better film than the original.,7,8 December 2009,"This movie is a bit better than the first movie, though it shares a similarity with the first film in that the main part of the plot revolves around Uncle Fester. There is a new baby in the house for the family so that means they need a nanny and they end up hiring a really crazy one at that. The kids are jealous and end up getting sent to camp while the babysitter manages to sink her claws into Uncle Fester. The plot is superior to the first movie and I think overall the laughs are better too. Though it still needs work as there are just certain things about the Addam's Family movies that just do not work or feel right. I never cared for the way Lurch never spoke any words, I myself prefer David Cassidy's version on the television series. I also just do not care for the way Anjelica Houston performed Morticia as she still speaks to softly in this one, though I will say she was better in this one. Raul Julie though is still excellent as Gomez. There are many funny scenes in this one as I loved the riot at the summer camp and I also way the family sympathized with the nanny/killer in the end. The very end of the movie though was a bit too dark even for an Addam's Family movie. Still, all in all a nicely done sequel to the original being a bit better than it.",Addams Family Values
15,Wuchakk,The kids go to Summer Camp and curvy Joan Cusack,7,31 August 2014,"""Addams Family Values"" (1993) was the second of two films in the early 90s based on the 60's TV show. The story this time is that a charismatic-but-fake woman gets hired by the Addams as a baby sitter, but she's really a gold-digging ""black widow"" who's after Uncle Fester's fortune. She convinces Morticia and Gomez (Angelica Huston and Raul Julia) that the older kids -- Wednesday and Pugsley – should go to summer camp so she can be free to put her spell on Lester.This is a good movie if you're in the mood for campy entertainment mixed with black humor and amusing one-liners. The appeal of the Addams family is that they're the express opposite of any remotely normal family. Most of the time the filmmakers keep the Addams on the amusingly-odd-and-eccentric side of things – stopping just short of satanism – but sometimes they go too far and the joke's not funny, like when the kids and Granny try to bury their cat who's obviously still alive. I own cats and love 'em so this type of joke strikes me as sick, not funny; after all, what's funny about hurting innocent creatures? The kids' attempts to kill the new infant, by contrast, work better because they give away the kids' jealousy and their desire for their parents' love & attention, which they would never openly admit, of course, particularly Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and her ultra-emotionless disposition.Christopher Lloyd is great as Lester and Joan Cusack shines as the black widow. Seriously, Joan – despite her character's unlikable OTT deviousness -- is the definition of voluptuous beauty throughout; a stunning whoa-man and pleasure to behold. The summer camp scenes with Wednesday and Pugsley are also a highlight.The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Palos Verdes Peninsula (the Addams mansion), Pasadena and Camp Tulequoia, Sequoia Lake, Sequoia National Forest, California.GRADE: B",Addams Family Values
16,Mr-Fusion,Outstanding sequel,8,23 May 2016,"The one gripe (if you can even call it that) I have with ""Addams Family Values"" is the end credits song. Tag Team doesn't work anywhere near as well as MC Hammer did. But everything else here works wonderfully.More than the first, this is the epitome of a real-life cartoon, not to mention a refined one-liner assembly line. And the perfect casting extends to the supporting players (Joan Cusack and deranged Christine Baranski). But, for me, Christina Ricci owns this movie (this from a pretty big Raúl Juliá fan) with little more than facial expressions, from annoyance and disgust to unbalanced perkiness. Ricci's working with a much more experienced group of players, which really emphasizes her talent here. She's mastered this character. Her sabotaging the Summer camp pageant is the best part of the whole thing, and I'll be damned if she's not my favorite Pocahontas.This movie's a winner, on par with (if not better than) the original. With a cast like this, it's hard to see it turning out poorly, but refreshing that it's anything but.8/10",Addams Family Values
17,HumanoidOfFlesh,Funny as hell!,10,29 October 2001,"Usually I don't like horror comedies and I hate mainstream movies,but ""Addams Family Values"" completely cracked me up.It was so immensely enjoyable and funny as hell!Especially the first Thanksgiving Day performance,where Wednesday Addams(Christina Ricci)as a Pocahontas,and other Indians took a revenge on American colonists-I almost cried with laughter during that scene!I wonder what Americans think about it?As for Christina Ricci,she simply steals the show in this one!I'm looking forward to see this talented,young actress in more movies.The other actors are also excellent,and the film is filled with wonderful touches of black humour.Highly recommended.",Addams Family Values
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,100 times funnier then the first one,10,28 November 2003,"Even though the first ""Addams Family"" delivered a ton of laughs, you will get more kicks and need more air from this movie. I cannot understand how even one person could not get at least a laugh from this film. The whole camp sequences are hilarious. Christina Ricci has come a long way, and despite the many wonderful films I have seen her in, this was always my favorite role. The kids were just perfect for this comedy. Fester and Debbie, I absolutely loved them. I thought Debbie was the perfect edition to the Addams clan. :D Her speech at the end about her ""victims"" was right on key and on the floor funny! Any true film lover should give this movie a chance and have fun. It's a great film that might even brighten your day. In an Addams Family way :D.10/10",Addams Family Values
19,OllieSuave-007,Creepy and kooky continue.,8,2 August 2014,"If you like the classic TV show, you're going to enjoy this movie adaptation of the Addams Family, featuring Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Granny, Wednesday, Pugsley, Lurch and Cousin Itt. It has the same craziness and kookiness as the TV show, but, like its prequel, has more serious tones as well - in this movie, the family tries to rescue Uncle Fester from his gold-digging love interest. However, I thought this sequel is more comical and lighter in tone than its prequel, especially since a new kid character is added.The make-up department did another nice job in bringing the Addams Family to life and the atmosphere was dark, eerie and mysterious, a perfect Halloween-like setting. The acting is good and the overall story is amusing - a good sequel for some laughs and a light scare.Grade B",Addams Family Values
20,sddavis63,Good Fun And It's Better Than The First One,6,20 May 2010,"The first ""Addams Family"" movie didn't really do much for me, so I approached this one cautiously but ended up getting a very pleasant surprise. For the most part, this was a lot of fun, revolving around a gold digger (Joan Cusack) who tries to latch on to Fester (Christopher Lloyd) so that she can get his money and then kill him. Really, though, with that agenda - she fits right into the Addams Family! Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston were as good or better in the roles of Gomez and Morticia. The characters have a sweet innocence to them as a genuinely in love couple - even though, being Addams, there's little sweet or innocent about them! There's a second story that takes place in this, which is the journey of Wednesday and Pugsley to summer camp. Christina Ricci is creepily good as Wednesday, but this sub-plot didn't appeal to me that much. That's perhaps my major criticism of the movie as a whole. There's two stories - neither sufficient to carry an entire feature film, so they're combined into one story a bit awkwardly.Still, the wonderfully morbid, dead-pan humour from the entire cast helps make up for that.",Addams Family Values
21,thesar-2,Wait...For It,6,3 October 2019,"While I remember really liking the first one, I recall loving Part 2 way more than the original and mostly because of both Joan Cusack and Christina Ricci's awesome performances and lines. I was wrong. To date, there hasn't been a comedy sequel to outdo its original and it doesn't happen here. Now, that said, this movie is still hilarious with great lines, graphics, special effects, comedy, heart and performances from said Ricci, Cusack and Pugsley's Jimmy Workman. It's just nowhere near the heart and spark of the first one. Characters here, established in #1 act WAY different than what was set up and we're only to rely on Ricci, Cusack and Workman to carry the movie.I highly recommend this movie, especially for Ricci's one-liners, namely at camp. But, remember it's just a nice companion to the original and set your expectations a bit lower.",Addams Family Values
22,ElMaruecan82,Take the Addams out of their zone of macabre comfort and you have the premise of great comedy...,8,30 July 2016,"I said about the first film that Barry Levinson understood the Addams, not the audience. The look was there but the plot involving Uncle Fester's introduction to the Family to serve some malevolent business scheme didn't exploit the comedic potential of the Family to its fullest, and for a simple reason: the undercover uncle was as weird and wacky as everyone else and once we get immersed in the Addams' inner circle, no matter how bizarrely sinister it gets, we become immune to the effect of surprise and mildly smirk when we should be laughing.Now, this is a critic I can't formulate about the 1993 sequel ""The Addams Family's Values"", I think it's fair to say that Barry Levinson understood the audience this time. Naturally, one glimpse at the poster, the cast and the first frames give us an idea. Everybody's there and the two-year gap between didn't affect anyone physically but there are significant newcomers, a baby and a bride, and these are not benign events in any family history. So the film remarkably confronts the Addams to the real world through real-life situations and instead of relying on a one-joke ""Addams vs. Reality"" note, it takes all the characters out of their zone of comfort and center their preoccupations on the basis of three story lines: we have the new baby, Fester's courtship, marriage and deadly honeymoon and the summer camp.But let's get to the film. It opens in a very straightforward way, Morticia Addams (Anjelica Huston) feels the sudden urge to go to the hospital as she will have a baby we've seen more passionate displays of starting labors, but hey, this is Morticia. And the labor is as hard and painful as it can get, and you can tell because she enjoys every minute of it. Then comes the baby, and when asked about, a joyful Gomez (Raul Julia) proudly shouts ""it's an Addams"" and seeing is believing: the baby is the spitting image of his father, as if he was designed by a doll maker... with the obligatory pencil-mustache. Of course, he needs a name, and if you ask yourself what can be worse than Wednesday or Pugsley, well, let's just say parents were sued for lesser names than Pubert.But here's where the film starts to show signs of improvements over the original: while the baby's birth could have been the inspiration for a few sight gags (there are some reminiscences of the first film with Wednesday and Pugsley trying to kill him), this is only a set-up, one thing leading to another, the baby brings the second newcomer, inevitably, a nanny Debbie (Joan Cusack), a beautiful blonde too fond on Pubert not to raise any suspicion. It is even fishier that she gets infatuated with Fester, and then we remember that he's a rich man and she seems to carry all the symptoms of the Black Widow. But here's the plot thickens, in order to keep on her 'nanny' cover, she needs get rid of the kids and convince the parents to take them to summer camp so they can repress their homicidal impulses.The film isn't funny all the time but you the dynamics work and makes it exciting to follow, it follows the rule that a good story with a few gags is better than a disjointed plot that tries too hard to be funny. And it dares not to focus on the Addams, Fester has never been my favorite character but his interactions with a woman he genuinely loves and who pretends to be attracted to him gives him a touch of vulnerability, and it enriches his relationship with Gomez and Morticia too, who still remain the romantic pillar of the Family. But just when you get too much on Fester, the film quickly jumps to the other subplot. And both are actually similar, you have a seemingly normal person who must pretend to love an Addams, while the Addams kids must adapt to the normal world, the worst, one that advocates such values as friendship, love and solidarity. Ugh!And this is why my favorite part is the Chipawe summer camp. Indeed, with the syrupy leaders played by Peter MacNicol and Christine Baranski and the perfect little Daddy and Mommy's little girl, the Addams kids discover a real world which is do diametrically opposed to theirs that it is scary in its own joyful way, a bit like Debbie can be creepy behind her angelic smile. In the camp, there's another outsider Joel Glicker, a Jewish nerd allergic to everything (before it would become a cliché) and somewhat, the story manages to make the chemistry work between Joel and Wednesday, and their surrender to the saccharine tyranny believable (who can resists hours of ""Sound of Music""?). There's also a very clever part showing all the kids who couldn't make it in the Pocahontas play, and the way their ethnic backgrounds play is a delight of politically incorrect humor.The power of the first two acts is to consolidate the Addams' status as outcasts no matter how hard they try to fit. And it all comes to a point where we want the Addams to be back to their 'normal' abnormal lifestyle, (or form for one of them), like the title says, the Addams have values, twisted and weird, but values nonetheless. The only sad aspect is to see Raul Julia in such energy and enthusiasm in a movie made one year before its untimely passing. And it's so sweet to see a young Cristina Ricci with her creepy smile closing the film, illustrating this bizarre mix of macabre and humor.The movie ends in the perfect note except maybe for the dreadful ending son, one that manages to get more horrific than the first one. Since the script transcended the sitcom format, how about a little nod with the usual da-da-da, and the two finger snaps.",Addams Family Values
23,ericstevenson,"Love you, Wednesday",8,12 January 2017,"This is a film I've always wanted to see because I grew up watching a lot of movies in the early 1990's that were remakes of old shows and cartoons. I heard this was the best of them all, even better than the original Addams Family movie. I really do like this movie if only because of the awesome casting. I really had no idea Christopher Lloyd was in so many unique roles and he's great here as Uncle Fester. The original movie was good, but I think this one truly gives us more of an ongoing story. It's great to have this movie that further expands on the characters and stories that were established in the original movie. I just love the cool costumes and atmosphere.I'm not much of an ""Addams Family"" fan, but this certainly got me interested. What makes this movie is Wednesday. She steals every single scene she is in. I just love her deadpan style. I love her delivery and I really do understand the weird relationship she has with the other characters and this odd romance she has with this one kid. I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. The snarkiness of this character is so entertaining. We have such a lively cast with Raul Julia in one of his last roles as Gomez. I guess the weakest part might be the story, but with all these great characters, it's hard not to like it. And again, it's authentic to the style of the original show. ***",Addams Family Values
24,lesleyharris30,"Loses the Heart and Humour of its Predecessor,",4,20 July 2016,"Addams Family Values is a very poor movie with a brutally paced plot and a few talented cast members that could have done so much netter. The actors do their very best, with Angelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christina Ricci still shining in their respective roles, however, they were not enough to save this movie, which tries to hard to stand out from the first Addams family that it forgets to even tell a story. A lot of comments are far too much for a younger audience, such as Wednesday mentioning that her parents have had intercourse, or the antagonist's torture chamber, it is far too frightening for the films target audience. On the other hand, the humour is also too childish for the most part, such as the Addams new baby causing havoc and the entire camping plot, leaving nothing for adults to have a chuckle at. Loud, obnoxious and not funny, Addams Family Values is too childish for adults, and too adult for kids, better off avoiding this. The family must rescue their uncle from a new love. Best Performance: Raul Julia / Worst Performance: Joan Cusack",Addams Family Values
25,Bored_Dragon,My childhood crush,7,8 August 2018,"This is a movie that made Christina Ricci famous, well deserved. The cast is the same as in the first film, but with the better scenario they got the chance to really show their skills, and Kristina is really fantastic. The scene in which Wednesday is trying to shape a smile is one of the creepiest things ever shown in a comedy and, for me, the first association to this film. In my opinion, the only weak point of the film is the performance of Joan Cusack, which seems too artificial. Regardless of whether it is a bad acting or she leaves that impression deliberately, I do not like it. Maybe it is not objectively better than its predecessor, but it certainly is much more fun.7/10",Addams Family Values
26,ironhorse_iv,Addams Family Value has a lot of value to me. I love it!,7,31 October 2014,"They're creepy and they're kooky, Mysterious and spooky, they're all together ooky, the Addams Family. Directed by Barry Sonnenfled, the Addams Family Values is the sequel to the 1991 American dark comedy film, The Addams Family. The success of the first movie was what inspired a trend of film adaptations of TV series throughout The Nineties. So, it was no surprise that a sequel was greenlighted. Based on the characters from the cartoon of the same name created by cartoonist Charles Addams. 'The Addams Family' film series paint their characters as much more macabre than the 1960 TV show sitcom, playing off as light dark humor. Often a nostalgia cult follow brand, the movie saw the return of many of the cast members from the original 1991 film. The movie has the same plot of the first movie. Instead, of a gold digger mother trying to manipulate Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) to get to the family money, we get a gold digger murderous wife, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) trying to do the same. The movie tends to focus more on Uncle Fester than ever in this film, as characters like Gomez (Raúl Juliá) and Morticia Addams (Anjelica Huston) are given, nothing much to do. Raul Julia really gives some good hammy one-liners to make up for that time. I love how they shot Morticia on the camera. Her lighting always consists of one beam of light across her eyes that gradually fades outward to add to her grim look. She is so beautiful in the film. She is equaling as funny as Raul Julia. I love the oddly place dance number. It made the little amount of scenes between them, so memorable for me. Still, I'm not really complaining, about how much Gomez and Morticia lack screen time. Seeing the serial killer, Debbie try to attempt to kill Uncle Fester are pretty funny and most of their scenes, together are well acted. Joan Cusack is great as Debbie. Not only that, she make an unlikeable character, into a likable character. She also gave the film, some really needed sex appeal. I have a crush on her character when I was a kid. I love the fact, how clueless and lovable, Christopher Lloyd makes Fester to be. It's one of his best roles, besides Doc Brown of the Back to the Future series. As humor goes, the best parts of this film are the Wednesday Addams (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) going to a pretentious summer camp subplot by Debbie. Christina Ricci is great as Wednesday Addams, and I wouldn't see anybody else in that role. She delivers nothing, but deadpan snark, which only serves to make her all the more hilarious. The whole Thanksgiving play/raid was such a memorable scene that every time, I re watch this film, I looked forward to seeing this sequence. I have no idea; why a Thanksgiving play is being perform in the middle of the summer, but I love it. I love the conflict between the over the top snobby living in a fantasy world, rich kids, played well to the realist grim Addams kids. The sub-plot is so much better than the main plot in some ways. If anything, the fault of the film could be, the main plot offered nothing new; while the sub-plot should had more focus. Even the sub-plot of Gomez & Morticia looking after newborn Pubert wasn't really needed. The movie is pretty smart for a kid's movie, bringing social satire commentary to a lot of adult themes such as criticize of consumerism, the mistreatment of Native Americans, realism vs idealism and others. This movie doesn't treat kids as babies. There are tons of things in the film that might be view as today as not suitable for children. It really depends on the parent, if this movie is worth your children watching it. There are lot of dark humor, such as trying to kill a baby joke, sexual innuendos, and lots of foul language. There are a lot of things that kids might not get. The movie is also really shot, well. Lots of fantastic scenery and special effects. The theme song is really catchy. Still, the Addams-themed remake of ""Whoomp! (There It Is) by Tag Team"" was a bit cheeky. Kinda made me wish for the days of McHammer rap from the first film. Michael Jackson was signed on to write and perform a song for the film's soundtrack and to promote it with a music video. Although he was able to finish the song, contractual difficulties coupled with the child molestation allegations made against Jackson resulted in the song being dropped from the soundtrack, and the video was never filmed. The song, ""Is It Scary,"" was later included on Jackson's 1997 'Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix' album and was also used in his short film, Ghosts (1997). Overall: The movie is not to be taken too serious in a logic sense, it is a tongue-in-cheek comedy that work so well in its own world. It's worth the watch on Halloween or any good day, when a good laugh is needed.",Addams Family Values

28,slightlymad22,Christina Ricci Is Perfect,7,15 November 2014,"After ""The Addams Family"" made so much money a sequel was inevitable. And I actually enjoy this one a lot more than the first. I found the first movie perfectly cast, but a missed opportunity, as I didn't find it a good or even enjoyable movie. Plot In A Paragraph: Pugsley and Wednesday Addams aren't very happy with the new addition to the family: their new baby brother, Pubert. The new nanny Debbie charms the family, especially Uncle Fester, who is head-over-heels for her. However, Wednesday and Pugsley see through her. Debbie is only after Fester for his money. Before they can inform their parents on her, she has the kids sent off to summer camp. Despite great turns by Peter MacNichol and Christine Baranski in supporting roles, not to mention a memorable performance by Joan Cusack and her cleavage. It's Christina Ricci that steals this movie. Her delivery is superb and she had me laughing out loud more than once.",Addams Family Values
29,sol-,Family Plot Thickens,7,15 February 2017,"Envious of their parents' newborn baby, the Addams children repeatedly try to kill it before being sent away to summer camp by their scheming new nanny in this sequel to 'The Addams Family'. Often cited as superior to its predecessor, 'Addams Family Values' benefits from delving into the plot quicker with less time spent introducing the characters. What really raises the quality of the film though is the focus on Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams, who receives the most screen time here after Christopher Lloyd. Her deadpan line delivery and emotionless facial reactions are better than ever, and a bit where she slowly forces a smile after being forced to watch Disney films is a real testament to her talents. Another big plus is Joan Cusack's ever-so-slightly demented performance as the nanny who seduces Lloyd for his money; her repeated failed attempts to kill him are even funnier than the kids failing to kill the baby early on. Witty and funny as the script often is though, the screenplay is not airtight; the transition between the film being about the children trying to kill the baby and the nanny trying to fleece their uncle is quite jarring. The experiences of Ricci at camp - where she encounters the same Girl Scout who tried to sell her cookies in the first film - are also far more interesting than Lloyd and Cusack having it out. This is an enjoyable film through and through, however, with all concerned really in top form. Whether this is truly superior to the first film may be debatable, but it is certainly a very good effort as far as sequels tend to go.",Addams Family Values
30,filipemanuelneto,A brilliant sequel.,10,16 February 2020,"After the success that was the first film, a sequel was expected, and it actually appeared two years later. ""Addams Family Values"", moreover, kept the cast and crew of the first film and manages to match perfectly with its predecessor, proving my theory that the sequels are generally good if they keep the cast, the director and the screenwriter of the initial film .The central core of the cast is the same as the first film and manages to keep up with expectations. Raul Julia and Angelica Huston maintained the roles of Gomez and Mortícia Addams, and I think that with these two films, the two actors reach the top of their artistic career and their notoriety. Christina Ricci also maintained the role of Wednesday and, as expected, saw the relevance of her character increased in this film, corresponding with a brilliant performance. Christopher Lloyd is also in great shape here, and plays brilliantly with the villain, Joan Cusack, in one of the most remarkable works of her career.Good production values also deserve a brief comment. The Addams' house is wonderful in its unique way, the sets and costumes are excellent and totally go against what we could expect and the soundtrack is effective and competent.",Addams Family Values

Kids should enjoy it but it's oriented for an older audience who will get the sexual jokes and more. I really dig it and think this is one of the most funny movies of the 90's.The technical values are also here and Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd, the hot Joan Cusack and the sexy sexy Christina Ricci shine in the running time.Recommended for the 90's kids.",Addams Family Values

34,FiendishDramaturgy,Superior to the first in every way!,10,31 December 2003,"This installment was far superior to the first in every way! It was better in story line, direction, acting quality, dialog, and intent. This was the perfect addition to the Addams Family franchise. Unfortunately, it's also the last. Raul Julia has passed on, and Christina Ricci is frankly too old to be doing Wednesday Addams anymore. Their next attempt with Tim Curry as Gomez Addams, and Darryl Hannah as Morticia, was appalling, atrocious, and puerile. I HATED...LoAThED...dEtESTeD that movie with a PASSION! I left it out of my Addams Family collection; acted like it never existed. While I love Tim Curry, he is NOT Gomez Addams! The nerve!But I digress.Wednesday and Pugsley are sent away by their new nanny to allow her adequate time to ""vamp"" Fester. Why? Because he's rich. Why else? Now, Wednesday and Pugsley have to contend with the preppy bratlings at summer camp, while Morticia and Gomez must deal with the new gold-digger in the family.Grand Mamma has been replaced by Carol Kane...I hate it when they change players like that. But I'm torn between hating the change, and liking Carol Kane better. They should have cast her in the part in the first movie and I would not be IN this quandary.But that not withstanding, this is a far superior effort to the first, which was perfect to begin with.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Addams Family Values

36,Lechuguilla,Overuse Of Special Effects,6,3 December 2013,"Maybe I was expecting too much. But I did not find the film overall to be especially funny, though there are scattered scenes that are mildly amusing. To me, organic humor is expressed through dialogue. In this film, however, what we get are mostly sight gags brought about largely by intrusive special effects. The result is comedy that is highly contrived and artificial.A new nanny named Debbie (well played by Joan Cusack) comes to take care of the Addams' two mischievous kids; but the very attractive Debbie has ulterior motives. I like the contrast between her upbeat behavioral facade and the predictable gloom of the Addams family.We get even starker contrasts when the two diabolical kids are sent off to summer camp, where they encounter the nauseating sweetness of suburban kids and counselors. It's the camp segments that come closest to being funny. It's also the script element that generates some useful thematic depth.Casting is generally acceptable, although the actor playing Pugsley seems miscast. Overall acting might be slightly above average. Sets and costumes look good, with lots of attention to detail. Lighting choices manipulate well the film's mood, both for the downcast Addams house interiors and the cheerful outdoor scenes at camp. The film also exudes fine editing skills. The visual effects are competent but way overdone, especially toward the end.I would have preferred a film wherein the humor is expressed through dialogue rather than so many physical gags. This is one film where the basic premise is fine but lost points with me because of the overuse of special effects enhanced slapstick.",Addams Family Values
37,snoozejonc,"Great performances, especially Christina Ricci",7,16 October 2020,"Wednesday and Pugsley go to summer camp whilst Uncle Fester falls in love with the babysitter.This is a movie carried by the performances of the actors who do an exceptionally good job of delivering all the macabre one-liners and embody their characters perfectly.The plot is pretty uninspired with Fester yet again under the influence of another female villain looking to rob him blind of his share of the Addams fortune. It gets us from start to finish but is largely forgettable, particularly towards the end. That being said, there is a strong level of satire in the writing, particularly towards the values middle-class, white America, which was quite a prominent topic at the time it was made.All actors are fabulous. Raul Julia oozes charisma and comic timing. He and Angelica Huston have great chemistry as Gomez and Morticia. Christopher Lloyd can do Fester is his sleep and puts all of his usual mad energy into the role. Carole Kane is obviously having fun as Grandmamma Addams. Joan Cusack is almost scenery chewing as Debbie but does superbly well with the material she has to work with.For me the real stars are the children. Jimmy Workman is wonderfully deadpan as Pugsley. Mercedes McNab is perfect as snobby Amanda Buckman. David Krumholtz does a Woody Allen turn as the hypochondriac kid in love with Wednesday Addams.Saving the very best performance till last. Christina Ricci is absolutely brilliant as Wednesday and walks away with the movie. Her quick, dry delivery and mannerisms make the character a classic of modern comedies. If you only watch her scenes alone there is enough entertainment to justify the price of a month's subscription to Netflix. There is a brilliant moment when she lights a match and the Addams theme music plays; I never get tired of watching that.I watched it with my four year old daughter who enjoyed it but had difficulty with the dark humour.

Also, even though everyone gave a superior performance, like the first one, I liked Wednesday's (Christina Ricci) the best. If you ask me, Gomez (Raul Julia) and Morticia (Anjelica Huston) were absolutely kooky parents. I thought that Amanda (Mercedes McNab) was an absolute b****. However, when she and her parents (Sam McMurray and Harriet Samson Harris) were tied up and tortured, I felt really warm and tingly inside.

The cast does well with the material, especially Joan Cusack, I adored her as Debbie Jellinsky. Cusack plays the gold digging murderous nanny who seduces uncle Fester. That's mainly what this film focuses on, that and the children being sent away to a summer camp. That aspect of the movie makes for some great comedy because the leaders of this summer camp are the very upbeat happy type that wants the kids to join in on all the fun, and Of course the Addams kids aren't about to do that. The script is written well and it is chock full of dark humor. I would really suggest you skip the first Addams family film and just watch this sequel.

40,TOMNEL,Better than the first film.,8,20 January 2008,"The first Addams Family film sets us up with a plot deviating from the original series, not really knowing where Uncle Fester is. This one works better. It has a more casual feel, like a television episode, and has plots that could've been TV episodes, except extended with more jokes. This was a treat compared to the mediocre first installment.Only a minute after the film starts, Morticia casually says, ""Oh, I'm having a baby."" The family frantically takes her to the hospital as she seems to not care, and a new member of the family, Pubert Addams, is born. The opening scenes were hilarious, and many good jokes were thrown in this movie. The main plots, along with the new baby, are Uncle Fester's new love and Wednesday and Pugsley at camp. Fester falls in love with a black widower, and can't get the clue that she doesn't like him. The kids have a terrible time with the peppy, perky kids at camp, and the campers have a terrible time with these two bizarre kids. Unlike the last movie, this one really gave the kids a chance to shine, especially Christina Ricci as Wednesday. The jokes were funny, the movie was amusing throughout, and I'd highly recommend this, because it's downright fun.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG-13 for morbidity.",Addams Family Values

42,aidanratesmovies,"Excellent Cast, Excellent Jokes, Excellent Sequel!",10,24 October 2020,"By far a grand and very enjoyable sequel, Addams Family Values is not only another round of rich macabre fun, but also just may be better than its predecessor. First off, as before, I love the cast of this film. Raul Julia, who sadly passed away within a year of this films release, is an absolutely fantastic Gomez- as well as Anjelica Huston as Morticia. Of course I enjoyed Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester, providing a hilarious and fun performance as always, as well as Christina Ricci as Wednesday, Joan Cusack in a standout role as the films antagonist- Debbie, and Carol Kane as Granny. What makes the 90's Addams Family films so enjoyable is not just its charisma on screen and between its cast members, but also its stellar writing and humor which never lets up, its signature style, and the sheer enjoyment to be had when watching it. It's just plain fun, and it never forgets that as its main purpose, which not only makes it such a grand experience to watch, but also an experience to be had again and again. I enjoyed the Black Widow plot of the film with Joan Cusack's character. I found her character to be rather interesting, as well as one of Cusack's best performances to date. Her origins can seem a bit ridiculous, but all together, I enjoyed her presence on screen, and Cusack absolutely brought her own to the role. The summer camp sublot was also a blast, with some incredibly funny and ridiculous situations that I couldn't help but enjoy, and cheer for Wednesday's victory as she took their corny a**es down. In the end, Addams Family Values is a delight, and a surprisingly better addition to the franchise than the entry before it.

43,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Follow-up that Expands on the Story,7,17 October 2021,"This sequel is another one that I would watch regularly growing up. I'm sure that I rented it and then it seemed always be on the movie channels. This is also another one that Jaime had not seen and since I see this as a gateway horror film, it worked to watch in October for me. For this movie here, our synopsis is the Addams family try to rescue their beloved Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) from his gold-digging new love, a black widow named Debbie (Joan Cusack).We begin by getting meet our family once there. There is Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and her husband of Gomez (Raul Julia) They are pregnant and she goes into labor to start this one off. Back once again as Gomez's brother of Fester (Christopher Lloyd). We also have the children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman). This time around Granny is Carol Kane, who is Morticia's mother. Their butler is Lurch (Carel Struycken) and they still have the favorite hand, Thing (Christopher Hart). As I was saying, Morticia goes into labor and informs Gomez. The whole clan goes to the hospital where they have another boy, named Pubert Addams (Kaitlyn and Kristen Hooper).Wednesday and Pugsley have it in their head that they have to kill the baby or one of them will be killed. Granny confirms this was the way in the past. They try a few different ways to take care of the problem, but something thwarts them at every turn. It is decided by Morticia and Gomez to hire a nanny.After going through a few different candidates, the last one they see is Debbie Jellinsky. She is quirky like they are and they hire her. She starts that night. We learn though while she watches television that she is a Black Widow Killer. She has been married before, a couple times, and has killed her husbands for their money. We see that she has her attention turned to Fester, knowing that he is rich.Her first order of business is to get Wednesday and Pugsley out of the house. She succeeds in sending them to summer camp. Their parents can't believe this is what they want, but they are convinced by Debbie. They're sent to Camp Chippewa, which is for privileged children and ran by a married couple of Gary (Peter MacNicol) and Becky Martin-Granger (Christine Baranski). Our two Addams kids don't fit in well with the Grangers or the suck-up campers who are led by Amanda Buckman (Mercedes McNab).With the children out of the way, Debbie sets her sights on Fester. It is quite easy and after their first date they are engaged. They get married soon after and Debbie doesn't wait any time in trying to kill her new husband. On their honeymoon, she drops a stereo into the bathtub with Fester in it. He survives though, being an Addams.Wednesday and Pugsley try to find a way out of camp. They befriend Joel Glicker (David Krumtholtz) who doesn't fit in at the camp either. He's into serial killer trading cards and gets Debbie's card of the Black Widow Killer. Things are falling apart when she keeps Fester from his family, which causes issues with Pubert. This all needs to be resolved before it is too late.Now what I have to say here is that the last time I watched this and the original, I liked this one better. Having watched this almost back to back, I'm not so sure. That is not to say that I don't like this one anymore or anything to that effect. This one has already established characters and doing a bit more with them, which I do like. We are focusing more on Fester and the children during their time at camp than the Addams family themselves. Again, not a bad thing, but just what I've noticed.What I will say though, I love Wednesday and even Pugsley at camp. Wednesday with her crusade against Gary, Becky, Amanda and the rest of the camp is great. Workman isn't as strong an actor as Ricci, so that is part of why I said what I did. They focus on her more, which is smart. I love seeing them trying to break these two along with Joel. It is comical all the way up until the destruction of the camp. I do enjoy this.Something that didn't work as well this time around was the interactions with Fester and Debbie. The early stuff when we have Morticia, Gomez and the crew, that all worked. When he goes off with her though, it feels rushed and not as interesting when I watched it recently. Going along with that not working as well, Pubert isn't as fun when Wednesday and Pugsley aren't trying to kill him either. That feels morbid to say, but it is the Addams family.I don't want you to think that I hate this though. The acting is good here still. I think cutting down the time we have with Huston and Julia is part of it, as they're great. Lloyd is still on point with Fester. I don't even hate Cusack as Debbie. She has this weird bubbly personality that she grows tired of as things progress. She is diabolical which is hard to do when dealing with the oddities of the Addams family. Ricci is also good. Workman is fine, but it is hard when his sister in the movie is just more talented. I do like Kane taking over as Granny. The addition of Krumholtz also worked. Struycken and Hart are solid as well. I also liked the cameos by Dana Ivey, MacNicol, Baranski, McNab, Sam McNurray, John Franklin, Cynthia Nixon, Peter Graves, Ian Abercrombie, Tony Shalhoub and Nathan Lane. The acting here is on point for me to be honest.Then the last things to go into would be the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, they are solid. We have some CGI here that isn't great, but this doesn't ruin the movie either. They went practical where they could. It isn't as good as the original, but it is far from bad. The cinematography there was well done and the soundtrack fit for what was needed. If anything I prefer this to the original in that department.So then in conclusion here, the last time I saw this one, I liked it better than the original one. This doesn't hold up as well for me. I like the expanding of the story, but some of the things they focus on aren't as interesting to me. The acting though is on point. The cinematography is well done. The effects aren't as good here, but the soundtrack works better for me. I'd still say that this is a fun movie that I would recommend, especially if you want to get children into the horror genre. I consider this a horror film, where not everyone does. This is still an above average movie to me.",Addams Family Values
44,a_chinn,Christina Ricci steals very funny sequel with her subversive summer camp storyline,7,24 July 2018,"I hadn't seen this film in years and it holds up quite well. The story involves gold-digging black widow Joan Cusack worming her way into the family by way of seducing Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester. Cusack then tricks Gomez and Morticia into thinking Pugsley and Wednesday want to go to summer camp, which results in the film's funniest moments, mainly of which involve super enthusiastic and positive camp counselors Peter MacNicole and Christine Baranski trying to convert the two glum children into Shiny Happy People. My favorite part of their conversion therapy is when they're forced to watch the John Huston film version of ""Annie."" The film cuts between Pugsley and Wednesday's adventures at camp with Cusack plotting to kill Fester and take the family fortune. Both stories are quite funny, but the camp moments are especially good. The funniest moment of the camp storyline, and probably the film in general, is when the campers perform a re-enactment of the ""First Thanksgiving"" where all of the blond hair, blue eyed campers play the Pilgrims and the camp misfits play the Indians, when Wednesday, a scene stealing 12-year old Christina Ricci, as Pocahontas and her awkward boyfriend go off-script, turning this syrupy (and historically invacuate) play into a story or revenge for the future evils perpetrated upon Native Americans by these European immigrants, complete with Wednesday's crew burning the village set to the ground and burning Pilgrim leader Mercedes McNab at the stake. Although Riccci clearly steal the film, the rest of the cast is pretty amazing as well, including Anjelica Huston as Morticia Addams and Raul Julia as Gomez Addams, Carol Kane as Grandma, and supporting parts for Sam McMurray, Nathan Lane, Cynthia Nixon, David Hyde Piers, Peter Graves, and Tony Shalhoub. The film is not quite a comedy classic, but it's undeniably entertaining and more darkly funny than most Hollywood comedies.",Addams Family Values
45,TheOneThatYouWanted,Anjelica Huston makes this series good,7,9 February 2017,"The sequel is better than the original. Whoa, I'm not sure if I ever said that before ever but yeah, this is better than the first one but not by a large margin. What the director did was take the opportunity to sort of do a reboot. He got rid of the magical stuff, let the Addams family members interact with normal people more often, the grandmother seemed funnier and they gave us more of Anjelica Huston. I literally just finished watching the two films back to back however I started with this one because I thought it was going to be the weaker of the two. Surprised to be wrong but sort of paid the price a tad later on in my little marathon / experience / experiment. Anyway, this film is fun. Not hilarious but it has d a few moments here and there.",Addams Family Values
46,nycritic,They're Back... and Darker Yet,10,30 January 2006,"She's a pleasant young woman who always dresses in light colors and has a demeanor that would win you over. That is, until you find out that she's been responsible for the deaths of several other people and is after your fortune like her life depends on it.This is Debbie Jelinsky, and her life story reads like something out of ""East of Eden"" in which the main heroine did some unspeakable things to everyone who came in touch with her, including and beginning with her parents. She's been assigned to take care of the Addams children because as of late they've taken a homicidal interest in their youngest brother Pubert and no other nanny seems able to handle their recklessness. Of course, no one realizes that she's after Uncle Fester and his money, and in the Addams' world, watching television is not a priority, because had they tuned in to watch ""American's Most Disgusting Criminals"", they would have found quite a lot about her.ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES is one of those rare sequels that while being practically the same movie (with a plot revolving around Uncle Fester and his fortune which could, under the wrong hands, affect the entire Addams family), redone with a different villainess, is actually better than the original. The tone is much darker still: Wednesday's sadistic side, subdued in the first film, comes full bloom like her own entrance into young womanhood, and Joan Cusack, while looking quite a lot like Marilyn Munster from the rival series ""The Munsters"", is by far the ugliest character in the story. Had this been a mainstream drama or suspense thriller her black widow tendencies would have been a little much to bear, but Cusack plays her villainy to the hilt and overshadows Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia who are even better and make one of the screen's best romantic couples of all time (despite their dark makeup).The last adaptation made for the big screen, Charles Addams' characters would move to the small screen in a new version of the 1960s show and a TV movie, neither very successful.",Addams Family Values
47,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Addams Family Values""- The delightfully creepy and kooky family we all know and love return in this superior sequel!",9,28 October 2017,"Two years after successfully returning to the focus of pop-culture with a thrilling and amusing big-budget Hollywood remake, that delightfully creepy and kooky family we all know, love and fear is back in ""Addams Family Values"", once again directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Inspired by the delightfully dreary comics of series creator Charles Addams while taking plenty of inspiration from the classic 60's sitcom, I was a pretty big fan of the first ""Addams Family"" film. It was the rare revival that paid loving respect to what came before without feeling the need to satirize or talk down to the source material. But for my money, this 1993 follow-up is in every way a superior sequel. It raises the stakes. It piles on the laughs. And it finds the perfect balance between story and humor.The Addams Family gets a little bigger and crazier when Morticia (Anjelica Huston) gives birth to their newest addition- a bouncy baby boy named ""Pubert."" However, this doesn't sit well with siblings Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman), whom see their new brother as competition. In order to quell the growing rivalry between the children, Morticia and Gomez (Raul Julia) hire on a new nanny to watch after them. However, they are unaware that the attractive Debbie (Joan Cusack) is actually a serial killer known as the ""Black Widow"", with a penchant for marrying older men and then bumping them off for their money. And she has her sights set on Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) and his enormous wealth!The thing I really admire about this film is how well it balances the ratio of story to humor and how the structure of the film is built for maximum effectiveness. A great part of the fun of the ""Addams Family"" concept is the fact that most of the humor comes from the contrast between their inherent insanity and typical middle and upper-class values. It's an idea built around subversion. And I think this film handles that very well by wisely dividing the story into three sort- of episodic adventures that place members of the clan in different situations. Those of course being the archetypal rivalry between siblings, a subsequent subplot involving Wednesday and Pugsley being sent to summer camp, and the overarching storyline about the deadly romance that forms between Debbie and Fester and how it affects the family as a whole. It creates opportunities to organically unleash the Addams' onto the world for comedic effect, and I found it functioned quite a bit better than the loose narrative of the original.Once again, the wild and wonderful ensemble cast shines through as the highlight of the film, and I like the fact that the movie shifts focus onto members of the family who weren't featured quite as heavily in the previous outing. The standouts here being the delightfully deadpan Ricci and amusingly mindless Workman as Wednesday and Pugsley, whose plot lines make up a good bulk of the film. There's a definite theme of youth in the movie, so it makes sense for the children to take the center stage, and both do very well with the material. Lloyd is as fun as ever as the hapless Fester, and it's fun seeing him try to cope with his general cluelessness when it comes to women and romance. Julia and Huston are as deliciously hammy as ever as the psychotic lovers that are Gomez and Morticia. And I really loved Cusack in her scene- stealing performance as the devious diva that is Debbie. Bonus points go to Carole Kane whom takes over the role of ""Grandmama"" with gusto and a young David Krumholtz as the neurotic Joel- a fellow camper who develops feelings for Wednesday.Also a step-up is the wondrous production assembled by Sonnenfeld and the twisted and hilarious script by playwright Paul Rudnick. The film is an aesthetic powerhouse with sharp, keen visuals and a brutally manic pace that lends itself exceptionally well to the material. Sonnenfeld injects such a sheer, voracious sense of spunk and fun into his visual storytelling that it's just infectious. You can't help but feel completely satisfied by the time the credits roll, and you feel like everyone put their hearts into the film. And the script is just fantastic. Almost every other line is punctuated by a clever gag, the pitch-black humor is out full force, and there's some really smart satire injected beneath the surface. You really couldn't ask for more out of an Addams story.Were I to point out any flaws, it's the fact that the movie makes one critical error that I can't help but notice. That being that once again, and despite the rampant creativity otherwise... the film is essentially built around a plot involving Fester and an attempt at extorting money from the family. Fester's plot-line is basically exactly the same as the first movie. Everything else is fresh and new... So why just regurgitate an almost identical plot-thread?Thankfully the film's grand humor, outstanding performances and wild visuals more than make up for this admittedly major flaw. 1991's ""The Addams Family"" was a solid and satisfying revisit to a cherished old property. But 1993's ""Addams Family Values"" sees that concept and one-ups it by improving over what came before in virtually every way. It's tighter. It's funnier. It's crazier. And indeed... it's kookier. This is one family reunion you'll want to revisit over and over again. And so, I give ""Addams Family Values"" an excellent 9 out of 10! A superior sequel in every way.",Addams Family Values
48,mike48128,Almost Better than the First-Still Something Missing?,7,9 October 2012,"The cast is almost perfect, as even Christopher Lloyd has ""grown"" into the role of Fester, but something is still lacking in this sequel. The mansion interior seems smaller and incomplete. ""Pubert"" is a great new character. He saves the ending of the film. His cannonball-Rube Goldberg-baby-saves-the-day sequence is brilliant. It appears that a key scene were shot together with the first film, as the graveyard wedding gives the Addams extended clan very little to do here. Sadly, there are too many movies made like this: A great beginning and ending with a ""draggy"" middle. Like the first film, too much time is spent on several non-Addams characters and locations. The summer camp sequence is good, (BBQ'd camp counselors, anyone?) but it seems out-of-place somehow, except for Wednesday's new creepy boyfriend. The atmosphere of the film seemed best at the Addam's Mansion, and not enough time is spent there in both films (and even less here). There is no growling bear rug, ""Cleopatra plant"" or exploding toy trains in this one. I wish a sequel had been made exploring the relatives in the graveyard; like a ""haunted graveyard"" sort of theme. I suppose another good sequel became impossible due to Raul Julia's untimely death. (I hear the totally-recast-straight-to-video 2nd sequel is dreadful--I have not seen it.) Back to what's missing in this second attempt: More visitors to the mansion. More for the supporting actors to do. A longer film. Also, the ending title ""music"" (rap-remix) is worse than the first. I would have used the original ""Addams Theme"". However, a good sequel, as the turkey pageant at summer camp very is very appropriate for Thanksgiving viewing.I doubt there will be another attempt to do this series. Well, at least it wasn't as bad as the ""Bewitched"" remake.",Addams Family Values
49,Howlin Wolf,Entertaining and improved sequel.,7,20 April 2001,"The first in the series was by no means a BAD film, but I would say this one is better.  It concentrates less on getting the production values right and more on a 'looser' script that gives the performers room to breathe. The production design is still excellent, which is a plus, but by this time the makers knew they could do it, since they'd done it before.  I felt the first film was hampered slightly by an overly complex plot, which sometimes stifled the 'natural' humour that was trying to be created.   One of the main strengths of the original, I felt, was its cast.  The principal players all return here and do excellent jobs, with the additional bonus of the superb Joan Cusack playing Fester's would-be amour.  Christina Ricci was absolutely superb as ""Wednesday Addams"" in the first one, but did not get enough screentime.  Happily, that mistake is rectified here, and it is her character and performance that provide some of the movie's most comedic moments.   The same deadpan tone and dark humour of the original is employed here, but in a package that children will probably also enjoy.  I always like it when film-makers don't narrow their target down to a specific audience.  Not a comedy classic, by any means, but a film that takes the best elements from its predecessor and sacrifices those that did not work.  An entertaining watch.",Addams Family Values

Also, Uncle Fester falls in love with the new nanny(played by Joan Cusack). She is not what you'd think, she is actually a serial killer who marries men and murders them the next day. Also, Debbie, Fester's new wife, convinces Gomez and Morticia to send their children to Summer camp, where they creep everyone out. I think that Addams family values is a bit better than the original. The original film was funny, but the sequel was even better. I liked Joan Cusack as the serial killer.

52,lambiepie-2,I too liked this one even better than the first,8,9 March 2007,"I'd probably rehash all the fun things that was said about this sequel - but I too have to say, this was funnier.Sending the two Addams children to an 'overprivleged' camp was priceless and to be honest, I went to a camp like that at around that age. And I was the total misfit. Everyone there too were happy and blonde and knew each other. And oh yes...and the Graingers, Becky-Martin and Gary (played by Christine Baranski and Peter McNicol) were just like a few of the camp directors I had known. The most entertaining part to me is when Gary Grainger was staging his ""vision"" (play) and one of the campers was in another world, very off choreography. Garry goes over to the camper and hits him with a paper in frustration not losing a beat. I actually witnessed something similar to that at my camp too with a fellow unconcerned camper on talent training night. Too funny.I never thought anyone could capture a place like that until I saw this film. The only difference is, Wednesday Addams (with a top performance by Christina Ricci) did what I wanted to do.Raul Julia (Gomez) and Angelia Houston (Mortica) were enjoyable to watch as their two older children try to dispose of the new baby - a mustasched chip off the old block of his father. Joan Cusack comes in as the murderous gold digging babysitter and had a nervously funny performance with Gomez's brother played by Christoper Lloyd (Fester Addams)as her unsuspecting victim.But the better parts of this sequel to me that makes the film work really well - are the one liners.

Addams Family Values and the prequel are both movies that I love and greatly enjoy no matter how often I see them.  The acting is brilliant, the decorations are perfect, the script is very funny;  and it seems that Barry Sonnenfeld was born to direct Addams Family films.  The movie is also very realistic:  I can attest to that on account of having worked as a counselor in a summer camp once, my nearly nearly identical family life, and -- admit it, guys -- haven't we all had, at some point in our life, a Fester Addams - Debbie Jellinsky - type of relationship?",Addams Family Values

55,Stampsfightclub,Ghoulish funny characters steal the show in this average fantasy comedy,7,2 January 2007,"The joyous spooky Addams Family return with a twist in this stupefied but funny fantasy comedy. With a new baby the Addams children are becoming jealous so the delightful parents Morticia and Gomez hire a nanny to take care of them, only for the nanny to cause problems for the family, especially Uncle Fester (decently portrayed by Lloyd). An occasional bone tickling fantasy comedy with a fantastic set of humorous characters, most specifically the stern faced morbidly gruesome Wednesday Addams, portrayed brilliantly by Christina Ricci (Monster). A fast moving tale which centres on the family and their lives involving marriage, parenthood, family and upbringing. Sending the kids to summer camp was a delightful treat for audiences as we can recognise the parallels between normality and fantasy, such as what the Addams are accustomed to and what normal everyday humans are accustomed to live with. Its brilliant in the fact that we expect certain things from others and in return we don't expect certain things. Seeing a normal everyday situation e.g. the kids at summer camp is a sense of everyday life but juxtaposing the monstrous Addams children was a delight as we see how they will react under different circumstances and it is definitely worth watching.It conforms brilliantly to the comedy genre and the ghoulish settings and characters are fantastic. However the plot is often stupefied and unrealistic. Many incidents appear too good to be true and of having such a fantastic impact in the first film, the sequel often drops in standard. The film appears to be trying to hard to be special and super; a prime example is the ending. Everything is too quick at major points in the film and never has a realistic portrayal of a fantasy family that the first carried so well. The sensational pairing of Morticia and Gomez is not existent in this sequel which was a terrible shame as they were sensational in the first. Their gentle humour and spicy relationship always made me smile and apart from a fantastic dance scene in this sequel there is nothing here to suggest spice and grit about the leaders of the family. i recommend the first film and not the second. however this film is worth watching just for Christina Ricci as she was sensational as Wednesday.",Addams Family Values

57,TheNorthernMonkee,"the darkest of the dark, and beautiful for it",9,17 September 2004,"SPOILERSWay back in 1991, that wonderful of television families, the family Addams, made their film debut. Featuring a wonderful cast including Christopher Lloyd, the late Raul Julia, Angelica Huston and a young Christina Ricci, the first outing was a superbly dark feature directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. After such a successful feature, it was obvious that eventually a sequel would appear. Few expected however that this sequel would not only be as good as the original but vastly superior.In ""Addams Family Values"" from 1993, Gomez and Morticia (Julia and Huston) have a new child in the form of baby Pubert. Proving however that the family isn't quite so different from anyone else, the other children proceed to become bitter and frustrated at the new attention their parents give to the baby. In an attempt to solve this problem, the two parents of the family hire Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) as a new nanny. Debbie has an agenda of her own however, and it isn't long before things begin to go wrong for this creepy and kooky family.This film is one of those films which never really gets tired. Whilst some films can be magnificent in everything and win countless awards, after a while, even the most ardent fan will grow tired. It is a rare, and often unpredictable, quality to be able to create a film which someone could watch over and over again without growing tired with at least one point. ""Addams Family Value"" is a superb comedy because the second it has finished, there is a strong craving to watch it again and to look for yet more subtly placed jokes.With a stunning script, consisting to quite a strong degree of superb satire of aspects of American ""perfect"" life, this film makes us laugh from start to finish. With it's ridiculing of the American obsession with Summer Camp (does this genuinely happen or is it just cinema over exaggerating it?), we get to see what we've always wanted to see. Finally all those irritating kids who act like they're perfect and who get the best roles suffer, along with the obnoxious teachers, whilst the fat, spotty and ugly children all get to succeed in teaching them a lesson.As well as being so wonderfully dark and so superbly satirical, the true beauty of this film (and it's predecessor) is that the family group works so well together. The late Raul Julia IS Gomez Addams in so many people's eyes. Whilst appearing in 43 films before his untimely death aged 54 from a stroke, Julia is always remembered for his chemistry with Angelica Huston and the way he portrays Gomez. Huston herself was aware of this, and this is one of many reasons for her absence in 1998's dreadful ""Addams Family Reunion"" (in fact, only Carel Struycken's Lurch was a member of the original cast to return). Aware that the chemistry would not be repeated with Tim Curry, Huston chose to back away from the tired and infuriating third film.As well as Julia and Huston's performances, as little Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is marvellous. Showing a steely cold face for the majority of the film, Ricci plays Wednesday as the cold, dark, slightly disturbed child which she is. Aged only 13 when playing the role, Ricci demonstrates a considerable ability and should really have built upon this performance. Whilst doing good jobs in 1998's ""The Opposite Of Sex"" and in 2003's ""Monster"", Ricci demonstrates a potential in this film which has perhaps been relatively limited in it's appearance so far.All in all, ""Addams Family Values"" is a wonderful film. Combining darkness, satire and decent acting, this experience is one to be treasured. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll admire at how good a job everyone involved has done. One for anyone's collection.",Addams Family Values
58,oneloveall,"As well made as the original, but not nearly as original",6,17 May 2007,"Continuing with the same class viewers have come to expect from the original update, Addams Family Values is still the macabre fun time viewers would hope for, although the material definitely feels rehashed. Essentially this methodical sequel just mimics the success of the original, perhaps too closely to accumulate any individual honors.Of course the whole gang that made the first film such a treat is back, and right away that ensures this Addams is worth a watch, even if it is a blatant retread. Already familiar with so many of the clan and their darkly eccentric ways, the script just continues with the same site gags and impressive one-liners that were prevalent in The Addams Family. A plot, if you want to call it such, introduces a new nemesis, the killer-divorcée Joan Cusack into the black mansion, which merely gives Christopher Lloyd a larger chance to shine in the funny love story. Likewise, the miserably cute Christina Ricci is given a larger part with a funny romantic angle thrown in for good measure.Despite the new romantic angles and funny summer camp segments, Addams Family Values seems a little light on purpose to justify it's existence as anything but profit-driven. The same fantastic elements are still there, which in itself makes the film worthwhile, although only die-hard fans of that latest franchise incarnation would need to seek out part two, as everything was already covered appropriately before an obligatory family redux was demanded.",Addams Family Values

60,Min111,I like the sequel more,7,3 January 2021,"I use to have the video, and I would watch it every time as a little kid. In fact, I seen the sequel first before I seen ""The Addams Family"". I liked both movies, but I like the sequel that extra more. I think the sequel is the better movie. It's rare to see that a sequel is better, and that was the case with this movie. Why? That's a fine and good question. In the sequel, there's a lot more happening compared to ""The Addams Family"". Gomez and Morticia had a another baby called Pubert (funny name). Pugsley and Wednesday are sent to summer camp. And Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) falls in love. Pugsley and Wednesday don't like the new baby, and they attempt to kill it. The baby, Pubert, has a big role to play towards the end. I just like how wealthy Uncle Fester is. He was great in the first movie; he's also great in the second movie. I like Uncle Fester. He's my favourite character. He's a very shy person. ""The Addams Family"" are unusual. They're unlike every other family. I liked one of the girls at the summer camp named Amanda. She thinks she's special. She's the most popular girl among her friends. She and Wednesday don't get along. I like what Wednesday does to her. I hated those two people named Becky and Gary in charge of the camp. These are two characters you'll most certainly dislike. They got what they deserved in the end all thanks to Wednesday. Pugsley and Wednesday don't make many friends at the camp except for the outcasts. I thought the camp was fun. They get to do plenty of activities there. You have to see the movie. I like how the colour ""black"" is associated with ""The Addams Family"". It must be their favourite colour or something. Someone like Wednesday does look depressing. She never smiles. When she does smile, it's pretty creepy. You have to see the movie. I thought it was amusing! I found it funny that Pugsley drives despite being a kid. What made the sequel exciting to watch was all down to that one character named Debbie. She's a nanny. Gomez and Morticia hire her to look after the children. What they don't know is that the nanny - Debbie - is a serial killer. Debbie is a psychopath. Debbie took a keen interest in Uncle Fester, and she seduces him into liking her. Wednesday, though, is very suspicious of her. To hide her ulterior motives, Debbie convinces Gomez and Morticia that Pugsley and Wednesday want to go to summer camp. Debbie is not really interested in Uncle Fester. She is only after his fortunes. Debbie is simply playing games. Uncle Fester though can't see through her, and quickly falls in love with her. The two get engaged and are ""sadly"" or ""happily"" married. During their honeymoon, Debbie attempts to kill Uncle Fester multiple times only to have failed. She convinces and prevents her husband from seeing his family ever again - much to his disliking. Soon, Debbie reveals her true intentions to her husband. Debbie is only after his money. Will Uncle Fester escape? Will Pugsley and Wednesday escape from summer camp? You need to see the movie to find out. You won't regret it. I feel the acting was excellent by the actress that played Debbie. I was surprised who played Morticia. She looks very beautiful and different under all that heavy make-up. It's better, though, to see the first movie before you see the second movie. Someone like Uncle Fester plays a major role in both the movies, so that's why it's important to see ""The Addams Family"". It will mean you'll enjoy the sequel that bit more. I also like how the sequel is titled. It's a ""valuable"" movie or sequel. I'm glad a sequel was made. It was worth it.",Addams Family Values
61,baileycrawly,Timeless,10,21 June 2020,"The original Addams Family movie (with Raul Julia as Gomez) was fantastic And definitely did the source material proud.
However, Addams Family Values improves upon every aspect of a film that was already great to begin with, creating the closest thing we may ever see to a perfect film based on the Addams Family.
There are so many things that can be said for Addams Family Values. Once again, Raul Julia is fantastic as Gomez, presenting believable chemistry with Morticia (Anjelica Houston), his brother, Uncle Fester (Christoper Lloyd), and his children Pugsley (Jimmy Workman), Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pubert.
Then comes the insanely talented Joan Cusack as the nanny from hell, Debbie Jelinsky, by far my favorite part of the film. Her screen presence is truly second to none and, even in her most maniacal scenes, she never fails to provide comic relief and endless entertainment. Her chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester was exactly what it needed to be, and she really sold her character well.
Then, to add to an already perfect movie, we have the wonderful summer camp directors that are so artificially sweet it's sickening even to someone who isn't an Addams, Christine Baranski as Becky Martin-Granger and Peter MacNicol as Gary Granger. They were so delightfully odd and entertainably insane that they managed to give the oddity of the Addams Family a run for its money.
Without spoiling, this is a movie that is truly in a category separate from everything else. It's everything you could ever hope for in an Addams Family film and it does the source material and its creator proud.",Addams Family Values
62,chrisbrown6453,Another one?,6,17 May 2002,"Addams Family Values is that rare bird, a sequel that is better than its predecessor. Fortunately, playwright/screenwriter Paul Rudnick has seemingly been allowed to have free rein this time out, and the results are mostly hilarious. Sure, the plot is on the thin side, but there are so many priceless lines and scenes that you will hardly notice the narrative slack. There's a brand new baby in the Addams household. Pubert's a cute little bugger with slicked-back hair and a pencil-thin moustache just like Daddy Gomez. Pubert is something of a cross-dresser too, as he is played by the Hooper twins, Kaitlyn and Kristin. Wednesday and Pugsley, the darling Addams children, are less than thrilled with the new competition of a bouncing baby brother. They are sent off to summer camp after attempting some baby bouncing of their own. At uppity Camp Chippewa, the favored campers are blondes with names like Amanda, Muffy and Heather from privileged families. Needless to say, Pugsley and Wednesday don't exactly fit in. It all culminates in one hilarious and revengeful Thanksgiving pageant, ""A Turkey Named Brotherhood."" Meanwhile, back at the family mansion, Uncle Fester has his eye on the new nanny, a shapely gold digger named Debbie. Debbie has a shady past and seems anxious to waltz Fester down the aisle. ""Till death do us part,"" indeed. Angelica Huston (loved her eye lighting) and Raul Julia are again marvelous as Morticia and Gomez Addams, though their parts are scaled down for this sequel. Mr. and Mrs. Addams do get a showstopping dance number, however. The ever-delightful Joan Cusack playing the nanny gets her share of laughs as Debbie does Fester. Christina Ricci, as Wednesday, gets the best lines, and she makes the most of her opportunity. T.G.I.W.",Addams Family Values
63,bbewnylorac,Excellent entertainment,8,31 October 2015,"The writers of Addams Family Values totally 'get' Charles Addams' subversive, black sense of humour, but they also understand how the family satirises mainstream Americans' hypocrisy and superficiality. The scenes and characters in this movie are just like the startlingly witty Addams cartoons. Morticia refusing anaesthesia in childbirth. Grandma helping the kids bury the pet cat alive. Wednesday and Pugsley playing with a guillotine rather than toys. Two performances elevate this movie -- Christina Ricci as Wednesday and Joan Cusack as psychotic nanny Debbie Jellinsky. Ricci is quite other-worldly, has a great grasp of her role and is very focused. She has the best lines and is beautifully directed. Her performance as the girl who creates havoc at the school camp is hilarious. You get the feeling a lot of real life real school camps are as horribly wholesome as the one Wednesday has to endure. As Fester, Christopher Lloyd has a straightforward and very familiar character -- maybe too faithful to the original Fester. But Cusack, as his serial killer love interest Debbie, camps it up, and has enormous fun, with almost as many great lines as Wednesday. Her goal is to kill Fester and take all his money, but in the Addams' nutty universe, that's a perfectly acceptable ambition.",Addams Family Values
64,RiffRaffMcKinley,Better Than You'd Expect,9,3 September 2007,"As it turns out, there are a lot of people who don't like this movie, for one reason or another. In any case, it's not just a movie that can be totally dismissed. It was possibly even a little better than its predecessor... which is still just a step down in quality from the brilliant original sitcom.This film almost has a quality of Tim Burton creepiness to it, but you won't find his name anywhere on it. The new plot line is not as good as that of the original movie, because it deals with Uncle Fester's integrity when that should never be a problem. However, I think this film's saving graces can be found in the Camp Chippewa scenes (""I am a turkey! Kill me!"") and in Carol Kane's turn as Grandmama (""Just a curse. Have a nice day."") It's really impossible to dwell on the other aspects of the movie, so I hope you'll decide to give AFV the chance it deserves.",Addams Family Values

66,TheMarwood,Hilarious,9,23 October 2014,"Now a perennial broadcast on television every fall, it's difficult to remember that Values did quite poorly at the box office - opening moderately well before having its legs cut off the following week by Mrs Doubtfire. Paul Rudnick who did an uncredited rewrite on the first film, fills his script with hilarious one liners and macabre wit throughout and while the film is basically episodic, the comedic set pieces always work. The casting is perfection and the leads elevate the simplest joke with their committed and fantastic performances. New addition Joan Cusack is hysterical as the black widow with her lethal sights on Fester. The visuals and art direction are great and the film has energy to burn.

Besides Lloyd, the cast includes Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia, ideal as those Brontëan lovers, Morticia and Gomez. But Christina Ricci again walks away with the best moments as the chilly Wednesday Addams, making life miserable for two camp counselors (Peter MacNicol and Christine Baranski) who want her to fit in with other kids.",Addams Family Values
68,renegadeviking-271-528568,Addam Family Values review,6,1 July 2021,"For some reason, I've always thought I'd seen the whole Addams Family movie from the 90s, but watching it this Hallowe'en, I found that I didn't remember any of it! Oh my gosh, though, it's cracking good fun. I'd stick it up there in the same category of Beetlejuice (1988) and Hocus Pocus (1993). Fun, crazy, spooky goodness. (I also have a post about horror-comedy here.)The films follow Gomez, Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Grandmama, Lurch, Thing, Cousin Itt and Margaret, members of the gothic, macabre Addams family. The film is based on the 1930s comic by Charles Addams. The family delight in all things death, darkness, despair and woe. But they're a very, very loving family who care about each other's happiness.What I love about the storylines is just how whacky and fun they are. I like movies that aren't afraid to be crazy or over the top or goofy. This is goofy with a side of goth wrapped in a wholesome, if macabre, family that loves each other.The second one had me laughing just as much. Where the first film follows the storyline of Whatever happened to Fester Addams? Which is neatly wrapped up at the end, the second film centres around the arrival of a nanny who sends the elder children off to summer camp so that they can't uncover her plans to marry Fester and steal his fortune. As she woos Fester, with Gomez and Morticia playing matchmakers, Wednesday and Pugsley are forced to endure a militantly perky camp that refuses to allow anyone to deviate from what they perceive as enforceable fun. Wednesday, of course, revolts:Honestly, the 90s were such a good era of kids movies and these are two gems. Also, I loved seeing so many actors that I recognise outside of the central characters. My partner and I kept going, 'Wait, they're in it, too?!' So, awesome cameos are a plus. But honestly, for two films centred around a family obsessed with death, these movies are quiet uplifting and lighthearted.",Addams Family Values
69,undeaddt,Ridiculous.,5,13 January 2019,"Nothing more than a ridiculous movie which is made only to make you laugh and be funny/goofy.

The story is decent enough to add up to the number of funny Addams Family stories and the cast is very well chosen. Nothing more, nothing less.",Addams Family Values
70,pkzeewiz,"Even worse than the first, and it was horrible.",1,6 May 2010,"A gold digger comes after Festor and she pretends to be a nanny while she seduces Festor. There's a new baby in the house now named Pubert and the older kids are trying to kill him, so the nanny suggests they get sent to summer camp. At summer camp the kids learn of the wedding between this mysterious nanny and uncle Festor and they insist on getting home to stop it, but it is too late as the nanny has married Festor and made him promise to no longer associate with the rest of the clan. She tries to kill him to get the inheritance, the kids have to suffer the annoying camp counselors and other children and granny, Morticia and Gomez have to deal with the curse on their new born.Yea my description sucks but I hate trying to explain how bad movies are. This movie was the same boring type of plot as the first one. It offered nothing new and although it had a few laughs it was still worse than the original.Sonnefeld's direction was even lazier and the music was worse. They tried the TV theme song and kept playing it in different musical styles. The ""cool"" song they picked to promote the movie was by rap group Tag Team doing basically ""Whoop, There It Is"" and adding lyrics about the Addams family, how boring is that...rap songs are always flavors of the week and will never be popular as little as a year in the future. Too bad they dropped out with the Michael Jackson song.The old cast is back, the grandma has been replaced with the wonderful Carol Kane and she does such a better job. Joan Cusack plays the nanny and once again Christinna Ricci is the star of the film, with her brilliant sarcastic lines. Raul Julia, Angelica Houston and Christopher Lloyd did exactly as they did before, but there was more screen time for Morticia and Gomez. I was always most fond of Lurch but neither of these movies focused on him at all. The counselors did a great job too, very funny. Also some great cameos by people like Peter Graves and Nathan Lane.Perhaps kids might like it, but movies like this are just a waste of time to me, although they have fans and a following, they just lack comedy and can't handle the test of time 1/10 stars.",Addams Family Values
71,The_Orenda,The Perfect Sequel.,8,31 October 2005,"Imagine taking everything right from one movie and improving upon it in its sequel. Not too many movies can do that, and yet Addams Family Values does everything right. Wednesday and Pugsley are challenged and must evolve. So does Morticia and Gomez with their new child. But the true gem of this sequel is that we have a plot. The first movie is a gift to the audience, recreating our spooky family into a big-budget movie. The sequel contains an actual story, something we can be entertained with for another 94 minutes.The Addamses are blessed with another bundle of joy, but the parents must enlist the aid of a nanny to keep the elder siblings from causing harm. This 'nanny' though is a maniac who plans nothing short of inheriting the family fortune.This is Raul Julia's last great performance (ignore the others). It's also Christopher Lloyd's last great performance too, please mind the sarcasm. It's a real shame they couldn't do anything better with the Addams Family after this movie. I felt like we were all robbed in hindsight. By leaps and bounds the best scenes were that at the summer camp. There's no better moment than when Joel sees the ""Heal the World"" poster. Please see the movie for what I mean. It's worth the price just for that scene alone.",Addams Family Values

As with this genre and style of movie making, the acting is spot on. Everyone fills their roles perfectly and you get quite attached to all the family. They're all very unique, funny and dorky.Cinematography:
I absolutely love the screenplay of these films. Very creepy, gothic and goofy. All the background shots and special affects are really cool to see, you wont see any piece of cinema like this in this day and age.Story:
The plot of this one is interesting especially being a sequal where you can almost never live up to the hype and greatness of the 1st movie. This sequal does it justice and made for a funny, gothic and enjoyable piece of cinema. It has the same spunk as the original but slightly less great for some reason. If you dont read synopsis's it's about their new child and uncle fester getting involved with a psychopathic killer.Summary:

75,Morbius_Fitzgerald,"We're not shy, we're contagious",7,2 January 2014,"So The Addams Family was one of many sitcoms to have a movie attempt made out of them by Hollywood in the 1990's. Shows like The Flinstones, Leave It To Beaver and The Brady Bunch all had their share of remakes. From what I've seen they were...awful. Granted, not as bad as the current remakes but they were still awful. Somehow The Addams Family Values is the only exception.First off, the Addams Family show was based on single frame comics from the 1930's. The show was what the Addams Family name is most known for because the 1930's comics don't have any story, plot or characters. The show, to its credit, is actually still entertaining by today's standards. It takes some of the social commentary of the time and makes fun of it. Where The Brady Bunch was the ""perfect family"", The Addams Family was the imperfect family and the joke is the Addams' are happy about it.The plot of this movie is actually my only complaint. Its about Uncle Fester who gets a girlfriend who wants to kill him to inherit the family fortune. The problem with this is that the style of jokes aren't the same, don't get me wrong, this movie offers up some genuinely funny moments (unlike the Addams film with Tim Curry) but it just doesn't feel like a real episode of the show nor the same style of the show. Not only that but the climax is that Debby (Fester's bride) threatens to kill the Addams' but the Addams family embrace death. When Debby first meets Gomez, he jokes about killing ladies (""I bet you're a lady-killer"" ""Acquitted"").The subplot, however, is just pure comedy gold. Through a misunderstanding Gomez and Morticia send Wednesday and Pugsley to a summer camp where they want you to have fun...whether you like it or not. This was just a perfect rendition of the style of humor that the show is known for. This is only in the movie for...45% of the time. The joke is that the leader of the camp decides to stage a play, paying tribute to the first Thanksgiving. Its all butterflies and sweetness as opposed to...what really happened. I wont spoil the punchline for you but it's worth it.The acting is an area that I have to draw comparisons with the original show. I like Raul Julia as Gomez, Christopher Lloyd as Fester, Christina Ricci as Wednesday and Jimmy Workman as Pugsley but the rest of the cast either aren't on screen for enough time to develop (Grandma Addams) or just can't hold a candle (Morticia and Lurch...although, to be fair, the guy that plays Lurch doesn't have a single line). The new characters are all decently portrayed but the best ones are Mercedes McNab as Ellen Buckman, Peter MacNicol as Gary Granger and Christine Baranski as Becky Martin-Granger.So as a fan of the show, do I recommend this? Despite its problems, yes. It has many moments that are actually quite well done and despite the show having a bit more nostalgic value and...no dumb-ass gold digger plots, its still enjoyable. Some of the dumb stuff is enjoyable, its still funny, go check it out.",Addams Family Values
76,R_O_U_S,Creepy and kooky?,9,5 February 2004,"I'm a big Christina Ricci fan, but this remains her best work.  It's also a sequel far superior to the original  the director really lets his cast off the leash.  But the show is stolen by Wednesday Addams, sent away to camp. There's a scene where she is forced to crack a smile that had me hollering with laughter in the cinema.  Touch wood, remakes of old TV series seem to be on the wane at the moment, but this was one of the bunch that used love of an old show to do its own thing.  In many ways an ultra-black comedy, it boasts a fantastic cast (I swear Anjelica Huston was born for this role) and a director caught just before the point he went downhill.",Addams Family Values

79,andrewmerritt-31652,A worthy sequel,7,4 November 2019,"Addams Family Values is the sequel to the live action Addams Family and is also based off of the popular tv show in the 60s. In this sequel Gomez and Morticia have a baby, but raising three children is a burden to them, so they search for a nanny, who Fester has a crush on, but there's something suspicious about their new nanny. This is a worthy sequel to the first Addams Family, because what the previous Addams Family lacks in their family antics makes up for it in this one. However I can't but wonder that this was split into two stories between Wednesday and Pugsley Addams spending their days at summer camp to Uncle Fester's new supposedly wife. And part of me wishes that the movie would focus on the summer camp plot with Wednesday throwing insults at everyone because that's true Addams Family style right there. And that's where the movie shines, because i wished the movie would focus more on this story, instead of the Uncle Fester plot point. Joan Cusack plays this psycho wife killer who kills her husbands right after the marriage to claim their inheritance and her performance in this role comes to the point where she oversells her character that the script needs to keep up the pace too. She's a good actress don't get me wrong. If you don't believe me watch School of Rock. But she really oversells this performance to the point where you're thinking to yourself come one lady you're not fooling anyone except Uncle Fester.

A Gold Digging Female wishes to trap Fester into Marriage take his money then kill him. 2. The family has to adapt to a new infant addition to the family.This movie is pretty much the same as the first movie with the addition of the baby (Pubert) into the picture. The parts are once again acted out very well and the family still puts off the very Sinister vibe that they did in the first film.Having the move to Summer camp for the two child cast members is an interesting twist in the film and makes for some good extra jokes but really doesn't work enough to make the film any more or less enjoyable than the original.All in all the second Addams family movie is also an entertaining watch but nothing that one should head out to buy if they didn't like or wen't that impressed by the first one.,Addams Family Values
82,ty-jensen,Good sequel,8,7 October 2021,"I'm a 90s kid but I honestly haven't seen any Addams Family media till I was an adult. I revisited the first film last night and I just watched the sequel for the first time. Addams Family Values is a good sequel in fact its better than the first movie.The cast naturally slipped back into their roles. Christopher Lloyd once again stole the show for me but I'm sure plenty of fans feel Christina Ricci stole the show. Ricci is good as Wednesday in fact she has a larger role. Joan Cusack is good as the villain Debbie which isn't a spoiler.Addams Family Values is darker and goofier than the original but it doesn't go too far. The filmmakers take advantage of the PG-13 rating but kids shouldn't be traumatised or hardy any. The family has a new son named Pubert and his siblings try killing him! Maybe some parents were disturbed by that.The visuals are mostly good like in the first film. The visuals are mostly practical since CGI wasn't exploited yet. I guess Thing is mostly a puppet, he's digital maybe only once. There's hardly any CGI but its awful.Overall, Addams Family Values is a good sequel. If you enjoyed the original, you should see it sooner or later. Another sequel was planned but Raul Julia died in 1994 from a stroke and stomach cancer.

83,crash21,It's an Addams!,8,6 October 2015,"The movie does get a little slow at times, but I call ""Addams Family Values"" very funny. First, with the kids trying to torture and kill the new born baby, then when they hire the nanny to secure the kids (which tortures them in positive ways).My favorite part is when the crazy nanny sends Wednesday and Pugsley Addams to summer camp. Right there is when the movie gets really funny and very amusing. First with the Addams kids negative affections, smart mouthing, and annoying the camp's employees and kids that enjoy the camp. Their experience in the camp's Harmony Hut was something I thought was especially amusing. I also liked it when the Addams help take down the whole place with other miserable camp members.The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't get the Indian/Native-American concept right in the camp's play. Although this could have been meant to be incorrect, simply because in the beginning of the thanksgiving play's scene Wednesday Addams gives a rather nice speech about what will happen to and be taken from the natives in the coming future.Other than a little confusion in here, I think the ""Addams Family Values"" is quite amusing, and even better than the first movie ""The Addams Family"" that was made.",Addams Family Values

The most important one of these being Fester meeting a falling in olive with a serial killer.

88,talarisw,For the Addams family everyday's Halloween and now they welcome a new baby boy and Uncle Fester gets married... to a psycho!,10,2 October 2012,"One of the best comedies of all-time and one of my favorite comedies ever. This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called ""The black widow"" who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the ""Brady bunch"" to ""The sound of music"" and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin. A comedy classic about the #1 family of horror.",Addams Family Values
89,fullonrobotchubby,"Not as memorable, but even more of a scree-yum",7,17 August 2006,"The first Addams Family film was really funny, and somehow this one's funnier. It could be the whole concept of the completely anti-cutesy-Disney children, Wednesday and Pugsley, morbidly running amok through a children's camping grounds. It could be the quirky and lovable (as usual) Joan Cusack as the villainous and spoiled rotten fiancé of Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester. More than anything, I think Christina Ricci's show-stealing performance is what makes the movie. No, literally; I think this sequel wouldn't even exist if Ricci hadn't done such a stellar job in the first one. Her Wednesday Addams was even richer than the TV show's, and in Addams Family Values, she delivers the bulk of the film's patented dark humor. My favorite scene is Wednesday's adlibbing in the Thanksgiving play to the horror of the ""squeaky clean"" counselors. In the play, Wednesday and her tribe of ""children who have trouble fitting in"" forced to play braves give the audience what they should want to see when they take the ""perfect little angel"" pilgrims hostage and torture them for intruding on their land. I happen to think the first Addams Family film is a lot more memorable, but as far as cult classics go, this flick is a must for the collection. Ricci rocks.",Addams Family Values

Lines from Ricci like "" Is that your overbite?"" and ""When they woke up all their old noses had grown back!"" are superb and will be much loved in the UK, as it is how much of the States is perceived over here.Also, Amanda in this movie, is also played by the same girl who played the Girl Scout in the first movie.Add a little bit of romance between Wednesday and another kid at the camp and you have something for everyone in this wonderfully funny and worryingly endearing movie.",Addams Family Values

Speaking of Wednesday, the actress who plays her (don't remember her name) is honestly fantastic. She plays the character so we'll and is genuinely creepy, especially her smile. She's the best part of the movie. It's also disturbing watching her and Pugsley try to kill their new baby brother and the movie end with Pubert, the baby, kill the villain. It's so disturbing.

Lacking the enthusiasm of its predecessor perhaps, but with the same stellar cast and added greats such as Joan Cusack as the evil, money-obsessed nanny. In this follow-up, audiences are graciously privileged to see the blossoming Christina Ricci take her place as one of the better American actresses of latter years playing Wednesday, the gloomy daughter of Morticia and Gomez. Anjelica Huston provides the eerie beauty and creepy allure of Morticia, wife and mother of the Addams clan. In one of his last movies before his untimely death, Raul Julia gives one of his personal best performances as the cigar-smoking patriarch of the clan. Together, Julia and Huston are magical, timeless and perfect in their portrayal of the passionate, gruesome twosome. Huston is comparably as entertaining in 'The Witches', yet in more recent films, I feel she has become slightly stereotyped in her roles. One of her better performances occurred in 'The Royal Tenenbaums' along with Gene Hackman, where she showed some of the same lustrous enthusiasm for the role, as she did in 'Addams Family Values'. Christopher Lloyd of 'Back to the Future' fame stars as Gomez's brother Fester. 'It means to rot.'! Fester is the unfortunate romantic fool and prey to the children's new nanny, due to his infamous amounts of cash. Lloyd as always is loyal to the fans and never fails to make one laugh, as the rascalish younger brother. Entreating the children to adventures with cyanide and arsenic in the first movie, he remains a loving uncle, always willing to light a light-bulb in his mouth for Pugsley's entertainment! Jimmy Workman, I have noted is hardly ever credited for his very believable performance as the son of the Addams', Pugsley. As a young boy, constantly the play-thing in his sister's world of ""Let's play 'God'"", letting Wednesday electrocute him, assisting his sister in dropping their new sibling off the roof and generally carrying knives and other sorts of dangerous implements, all for the fun! 'Addams Family Values' is good, clean(ish) fun for all the family, but unlike its predecessor, it might be more enjoyable to the kids.",Addams Family Values

The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda was hilarious and good in her role.

Fester is lovestruck by a psycho nanny and moves away from the family, causing no end of troubles.

Though the story itself isn't all that brilliant, neither this film nor the first ever relied on the story so much as the performances, and once again the Addams family and those around them are brilliant. Raul Julia and Christina Ricci again steal the show, as does Joan Cusack as Uncle Fester's scheming wife. In fact, everyone turns in an excellent performance - and watch especially for Mercedes McNab as Amanda, reprising her role (then a Girl Scout, now fleshed out as the rich brat) from the first film - this is the young girl who grew up to be Harmony on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""

105,Shay17,Brilliant sequel,7,10 October 2020,"Sequels are so often a poorer version of the first film but I really don't think this is. It's a better plot than the first film (which is still brilliantly delivered) but Joan Cusack and Christina Ricci are absolutely fantastic in this.There's room for several strong characters in the original film that you'd assume another strong character couldn't fit but I think Joan Cusack steals every scene she's in and arguably the majority of the movie. She's so wonderfully psychopathic! Although that doesn't detract from the expected utter brilliance of Raul Julia and Angelica Houston who remain perfect for their roles.Christina Ricci was excellent in the first film, but I suggest she is even better in this. Her emerging from the log cabin and cracking a smile at having been forced to watch endless 'feel-good' movies is delivered perfectly. She chills you to the core!Christine Baranski and Peter MacNichol have some laugh out loud one liners that make this very quotable.For me, the most clever thing about this plot is the camp leaders and camp go-ers are supposed to portray the 'normal' folk of society and The Addams Family are supposed to be the freaks to be avoided and yet, you only root for the Addamses and their arguably more acceptable behaviour and values.I'd not hesitate to watch this every few years for guaranteed laughs.",Addams Family Values
106,gerold-firl,funnier than hell!,10,2 December 2011,"Addams Family Values is brilliantly funny. The premise is very unique: these Addams folk are a peculiar inversion of normal values, a sort of mirror-image of of standard morality. Everything that normal people like, they hate, and everything they like, we would find frightening or nasty. They are a perfect parody of evil. But they also have unlimited amounts of wealth, and that attracts a different kind of evil: real evil, the kind of real-world evil that real people have always had to contend with. And that's why this movie is not just brilliantly funny, but hilariously brilliant. Joan Cusack is marvelous as the evil nannie Debbie Jellinsky. She looks great doing it, and consequently she can almost be forgiven for her treatment of Uncle Fester. But no - the parody of evil created by the Addams family is an ethical mirror that shows the true nature of evil: the willingness to lie and harm others for selfish gain. Cusack's portrayal of the fair-seeming foulness of Debbie is wonderful.Side-splitting and heart-warming. 10/10",Addams Family Values

`Hello, Polly. I'll clean my room.In exchange for you're immortal soul.' -Wednesday (Christina Ricci)A new baby, Pubert, has been born into the delightfully morbid Addams Family.  Finding it too difficult to raise three crazy children alone, Gomez (the late Raul Julia, putting out a great performance) and Morticia hired a nanny.  Little do they know, but the seemingly sweet Debbie (Joan Cusack) is actually a multiple-husband killing, ax-murdering seductress.  Setting her sights on Uncle Fester for his money, she sends the two older Addams kids to a disgustingly perky summer camp, to pursue her advances without problems. Some of the funniest scenes occur at the camp, as the morbid Wednesday (played memorably by Christina Ricci) and Pugsley contrast and, eventually, wreak havoc on the vilely perky `Chippewa' campers.

110,brandonshedder,The Addams WHAMILY 2!!!! (It Whams You),9,15 September 2018,"What up guys, what did I tell you? I'm back again, yes Karen from accounting, you need to pay me again for my review of the Addams Family Values! That's right, it's ya boy Bran Bran with another hot and spicy sizzling review and this is gonna be a funky one.
When I saw the first Addams Family movie, I thought it was a clever, fun movie filled with brilliant performances. But when I heard a sequel had been made, my hopes were about as high as a little person in trouble. BUTT I was pleasantly surprised at the totally incredible #cool movie that is this movie.
The Addams Family Values took everything the first movie did right and doubled it. Yes, most of the time, sequels are pieces of poopy doo, but not this one my friends, oh no! Fester has been restored to his previous glory and is freakier than ever, but now *drumroll and gasps from the audience* HE'S IN LOVE! WITH JOAN CUSACK! AND HER CHEST! Especially that.
So you're probably wondering what this is about. Well then, you can look it up. I'm not here to do that! I will tell you though that this movie is not a repeat in any way of the first. This film has a 100% original story that involves romance, comedy, and some #drama with the kids at a summer camp.
First of all, the acting in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen from an ensemble cast, especially Christopher Llyod. Every second he's on screen is hilarious. During one scene in which Fester survives a huge explosion, I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe! His weird, frumpy, dumpy form emerging from the smoke with a plate of whatever the hell was so hot. I mean, funny. Yeah. *eyes dart back and forth nervously*
Although Fester is a major highlight in this movie, all the other cast members are extremely entertaining. Raul Julia as Gomez is also excellent. He's so overly confident, dashing, and great at everything that it leads to so much great humor. The fact that most of his ideas do work out no matter how ridiculous has this tea scalding hot sister. Sorry, my valley girl came out. It happens sometimes.
On the subject of acting, Christina Ricci is fantastic as always. Creepy, menacing, hilarious, adorable. and downright spookilious. She is surprisingly mature and talented for someone of her age and her performance is even better in this movie than the first. Seeing Wednesday Addams defending Native American people's rights while burning the pilgrim's village and torturing a bunch of privileged white people has to be the most satisfying thing I've ever seen. That girl is woke af.
That guy from Numbers and 10 Things I Hate About You was also a pleasant surprise. He was great as always. Go check that boy out in 10 Things. He's amazing. Go watch it. NOW. You'll also get to hear some fine jokes about a woman writing an erotic novel and Heath Ledger looking super weirded out about it. Cool. ANYWAY.
Thing is as amazing as always! He's like the family dog except not, he's a severed hand. Okay, who animated a severed hand? Someone needs to fess up because that person deserves a pat on the head and a medal with the word ""WINNER"" inscribed on it because I LOVE THING.
Speaking of cute, endearing creatures, I LOVE IT AND WHAT! What has to be the cutest thing I've ever seen in my god damn life. His sweet little pink binky is the most adorable touch. You thought you loved It? GET READY FOR MINI IT! WHAT!!!! Also, the fact that ginger lady married Cousin It is always hilarious and amazing and it makes me believe in true love.
The smexy frog Angelica Houston is also amazing in this movie. The weird lighting on her eyes at all times, her sexual innuendos about torture and murder, and her freaky romance with Gomez are all wrapped up in an uncomfortably tight dress that would probably keep her organs in if she was ever in a car crash. Safety first, kids. I love that macabre queen.
When this movie was released, film critics were very surprised at how much better they thought this one was than the first. While I do think this movie is better than the first, I don't think it's MUCH better. The first is definitely a classic and so is the Addams Family Values.
On the topic of issues with the film, I really don't have any. Moments some movie goers could perceive as ""cheesy"" are just hilarious to me and make the movie even more out there and fun. Everything is intentional in this film from the great set design, costumes, and fantastical plot line. If you have even the slightest ounce of imagination or decency you'll like this movie. Don't take it seriously because if you do I will know.
Overall, the movie is hilarious, weird, fun, and all in all just great. I watched this movie as a kid so maybe that explains some things about me. Anyway, that's all for now. Rest in Peaces.

From Debbis, fester's new wife, (and one of the funniest movie characters I've seen) to the summer camp that Pugsly and Wednesday have to attend, and the thanksgiving show that they are forced to participate in, this movie is just full of laughs from start to finish. I also want to mention Raul Julia's performance as Gomez. In order for comedy to be effective, the actors have to take their performance as seriously as possible, and Raul really gave his all to this role.

113,Blackhawk1989,A Black comedy with a ton of style!,9,29 October 2013,"'The Addams Family' originating from the mid of cartoonist Charles Addams have always been a delightful mash-up of Gothic horror and Americana imagery. Whilst their best known for the excellent black and white TV show, 'Addams Family Values' captures the spirit of the Addams at their best.It's a well paced and witty script, nailing the friendliness of the mad family right alongside their morbid obsessions. By splitting up the family for a good portion of the film, they really give the a chance to shine. Whilst the first film suffocated from having too many characters in the same scenes, this one takes the chance to go crazy. If there is a criticism it's the main plot once again follows Uncle Fester. He's fun to be sure, but the highlights go the b-stories.The cast are once again on excellent form. Raul Julia and the others are clearly having an absolute blast playing the macabre characters, and the addition of Joan Cusack as the nanny/serial killer is played to absolute perfection.So with a great script and a flawless cast, why is this only a 7? Strange as it may be, the production values do seem a tad lower this time around. Whilst the set design is all top notch, it did feel a lot more studio like in many scenes. Also the humour may go a little too dark for some. The blacker the better in my opinion, but this is obviously aimed at getting kids in front of it and the horror does amp up a lot at times.But at the end of the day what you have here is a film that managed to go above and beyond it's status as a product of the Hollywood production line and just be plain old fun.

The cast is brilliant. Raul Julia, Angelica Houston, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lloyd were born to play their roles. They're so believable in it that it's scary. Joan Cusak NAILED her role as Debbie. Her delivery of lines and her changes from a sweet hot nanny to a gold digging homicidal maniac is fantastic.The best part has to be the one-liners though. They're timeless and I still laugh at them after all these years. And can I just add the brilliant concept of sending Pugsly and Wednesday to a summer camp? Oh My God how awesome some of the best scenes in the film. I still crack up when Wednesday starts her ""How the pilgrims destroyed the Native Americans"" dialogue priceless.

The sequel has the same problem as the original: the plot is large and cumbersome and often gets in the way of the fun of the zaniness that is the Addam's Family...usually the pay-off is worth it. For example Paul Rudnick spends a lot of time building a plot in which Wednesday and Pugsley get shipped off to a summer camp. No one really cares why Wednesday and Pugsley are at summer camp, all we want to see is what happens when they're put in charge of directing a play about the first Thanksgiving. (If anyone knows where I can get a recording of ""Eat Me!"", let me know!) The saving grace of the cumbersome plot is Joan Cusak who is interminably funny and can save pretty much any bad screenplay that she gets her hands on.

I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was ""Grandmama,"" but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor.My Verdict: 7/10",Addams Family Values
121,ecp7039,Summer camp. Birth. Love. Attempted murder. Thank God the Addams family is back.,10,13 September 2005,"This movie is the best sequel ever made, because: 1) Face it, most boys growing up in the early '90s had a secret crush on Wednesday Addams. 2) Much of the movie is set in the creepiest movie house outside of the Amityville zip code. 3) A baby named Pubert? 4) The script is awesome and some of the throwaway lines are funnier than entire movies. 5) Christine Baranski and Joan Cusack and Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia and pretty much the rest of the cast. 6) Everyone loves Thing. 7) Tony Shalhoub plays a drunk sailor for about two seconds. 8) They spoofed the Carrie ending before it became a cliché. 9) This movie is just plain hilarious. Look up some quotes, you'll see what I mean.",Addams Family Values
122,dcarrano,pleasant surprise!,9,6 March 1999,I never would have expected that this is as funny as it is.  Vastly superior to the by-the-numbers first movie.  Check out this underrated film!,Addams Family Values
123,domotime2,Funnier every time I watch it!,10,9 November 2021,"Every single scene and line is a joke. While it's all the same level of joke, they all still get a big laugh out of me. The set pieces are all vibrant and interesting. The actors are all high level icons. Putting the kids in summer camp is genius. I've watched this like, 30 times, and it still cracks me up.",Addams Family Values
124,kurakukasu,Great performances make it worth the watch,7,19 February 2019,"I just watched the two Addams Family films back to back out of curiosity, since they both have decent ratings (I've never been into the TV series so I'm only catching up now).
I was pleasantly surprised by both, in part because they're really well shot and edited, but most of all, thanks to the cast: Angelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and young Christina Ricci are all acting with very communicative delight, and they're a treat to watch.
This applies to both films, but in the second one, Joan Cusack really is the one who steals the show as a crazy black widow! I don't want to spoil anything, so let me just say her character goes through different phases throughout the movie, and it just gets better and better.
Without her performance, I'd have rated this second film a bit lower, but I'll give it a 7/10 (more like 6.5, because the script is a bit... meh).
Great acting can make a huge difference, and both Addams Family are shining examples of that.",Addams Family Values
125,tristandude14,A real trip back to the 90s...,10,6 June 2014,"If you grew up in the 90s, you may have a similar experience with ""Addams Family Values"" as I have. I was born in '92, so this movie was brand new when I was practically brand new, but my first viewing of the film was roughly in '96 or '97 when it aired on TV. My Dad was flipping through the channels and came to one of the opening scenes of this movie. We ended up sitting and watching the whole thing that afternoon. What I find interesting about this movie is that it is so memorable that I still remember that day watching it when I was only 4 or 5 years old. This is true comedy at its finest and there are several reasons why this movie is so strong.One: The story. If you're a fan of the first film, don't be offended, but I felt that ""Values"" had a much better, more believable plot than the first movie. Don't get me wrong. The first movie was good, but the plot was, in my opinion, one of its weaker points. The plot of ""Values"" is memorable, though. The screenplay was very cleverly written. The idea of trying to kill Uncle Fester for his money is genius because while it's a plot that's been used before, the twist of having the indestructible Addams Family in on it gives it a twist. The character of Debbie Jellinsky, played by Joan Cusack, is in my opinion one of the most memorable movie villains of all time and that counts for not only comedies, but for all movies in general. This brings us to the second strong point of ""Addams Family Values:Two: The Casting. While most of the casting is the same from the first film, despite Grandmamma, the casting of Joan Cusack in the role of Debbie Jellinsky is near fine. If I had to choose one thing I remember most about this movie from the first time I saw it at such a young age, it's without a doubt the character of Debbie. Joan's performance was impeccable. She goes from sweet to crazy to funny in seconds. The role literally shows her diversity as a comedic actress. To this day, I quote the character and from when I was 4 years old I can still remember her iconic scene of laughing in the car as purely as I saw it then. Why Joan wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance, I'll never know. If she was nominated for ""Working Girl"" and ""In & Out"", why not this one?Three: Nostalgia. Okay, so this doesn't necessarily make it a good movie, but because the movie is pure 90s, it's a nice trip back to 90s lane for all of us who grew up in the era. If you want a fun comedy from the 90s that reminds you of the 90s, I don't think I could think of a better comedy unless you want to go crazy and rent ""Good Burger"". The overall look, ""pastels"", clothing, SUMMER CAMP!!!! It's all 90s. You'll feel like you've stepped back in time 21 years. 21 years? Can't believe this movie's been out that long now.Overall, I give ""Addams Family Values"" a 10 because it works in all ways. It's funny, memorable, great cast, great characters, and a fun plot. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.",Addams Family Values
126,MetaFilmList,Doesn't live up to the original,5,29 October 2013,"Where the first film focused on Gomez and Mortisha with Fester in support the sequel is dominated by a focus on Wednesday Addams. Fester still is the underlining plot that keeps the movie going, but only in a limited manner. Fester meets Debbie a con-artist who wants all his money and is frustrated that she can't kill him once they are married. She sends the children to summer camp and thus the film splits into two separate stories.One thing that is strange is that in the first film Gomez explains that fester was quite the charmer and he felt in competition with him. In this film fester seems almost silly in his desperate attempts of woo Debbie. Debbie would have accepted anything to work with as she wanted to take advantage of him. Yet most of the scenes is her struggling with the little that Fester produces.In many ways, all the other characters become slapstick versions of that which we saw in the previous film. Almost like a parody. With the exception of Lurch the butler who though similar to Frankenstine finds different ways to express his more creative side, by painting, cooking, gardening and playing the organ. In some ways, he may be the most complex character in the film and that's a little sad.In many ways, this is a theme of the film, to take what they had done so well in the fist film and make fun of it. In some scenes it almost seems like Loony Toons, anvils and all. The number of scenes that can be characterized as slapstick silly as numerous. For instance, Wednesday painting herself into the wallpaper, Gomez spinning Mortisha so quickly that the floor bursts into flames, and of course the new addition to the family, Pubert Addams being shot into the air and momentarily being seen through the window on an airplane.The jokes are at times difficult to understand and often not funny. Some light word ad-libbing is done well but mostly it's hit or miss. In addition, the so called normal characters they introduce in the film to contact against the Addams' weirdness end up being so silly and weird themselves that they make the Addams look normal. Ie. most of the kids and camp councillors at the summer camp. Maybe that the joke, but it misses the point of what the Addams family is. They are the weird ones not us. They just don't know it.Overall, the film is not that funny, watchable but just barely and ultimately killed the franchise. It feels that they could have done so much more but chose to be silly instead.",Addams Family Values
127,placelikealice,strangeness and charm work well in an sadly underrated movie,9,27 July 2004,"It's not often sequels are better than the original...but this is one of the select few.This is a fantastic film, cynical and biting with the best of them. While you can obviously mistake this movie for just a family film, I totally disagree and would put it up there in masked strangeness and charm along with the gene wilder and the great willy wonka and the chocolate factory. From the scenes at the summer camp to uncle fester and his wife. There's something special about this film that i can't quite put my finger on.See this movie, I like it a lot.",Addams Family Values
128,bethanjmorgan,wicked,8,5 October 2005,"i think that all of the Addams family films are really good. Addams family values has to be one of the greatest one's every though because unlike the other ones Wednesday and Pugsley Addams get more involved. Wednesday Addams is my favourite character because she's odd and thats what i like about the whole film really is because i know its a family but it's not an every day family like we see in other films. i gave this film an 8 out of ten which marks them on atmosphere, acting skills, use of props, style of language. I'd love to be an actress like Christina Ricci (wednesday Addams) She plays all of her characters well and like the Olsen twins she started her career at a young age.",Addams Family Values
129,uniquecliche,"It's alright, as far as sequels go",7,10 February 2006,"The problem with sequels is that they can't be as good as the originals; they have to improve on the original, be even better than the original, etc. This movie would be great, if it stood on its own...The first film had a certain and style of humor that all the camp scenes managed to equal, but it had trouble following through and continuing this unique dark humor in the scenes with the adults. All the best lines are with Wednesday and the barely-used Pugsley. And wasn't Uncle Fester a Ladies' Man in the original? Still, if it was on TV, I'd watch it. Still a great film. I do love watching idiotic blonde girls getting their comeuppance.",Addams Family Values
130,Andy Willett,"No longer rehashing old material, they're even funnier this time.",8,18 November 1999,"One of my favorite films. Paul Rudnick clearly had a field day writing this screenplay.As odd as it may seem, this sequel is in many ways superior to its predecessor. The first had to spend much of its time introducing the Family--and, just as importantly, paying (totally justified) homage to Charles Addams' brilliant cartoons and to the old television series. As a result, the plot felt forced, as if it had been the best way the writers could think of to showcase all the source material. In the end, one left the theater feeling that the movie had been 'about' the old sight gags. And then there was the totally shameless product placement...but I digress.Addams Family Values, on the other hand, gets to be more playful. Because we all know who we're dealing with by now, we don't have to spend nearly so much time introducing the family and their skewed universe. Instead, the characters get more of a chance to develop as they glide blithely through a fuller, more cohesive story.Paul Rudnick's screenplay is masterful--you'll be quoting from it for weeks. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are particularly marvelous as one of the most genuinely loving, passionate couples you've seen in ages. In a weird sort of way.That dance number! Morticia's ever-present shaft of light! Christina Ricci as the sublime Wednesday! Joan Cusack, unhinged! A split-second cameo by Charles Busch! Oh, rapture. I could go on and on, but I'm running out of superlatives. Suffice it to say that this movie is well worth your time.",Addams Family Values
131,Screamkillah,Fun and funny,10,16 June 2000,"I loved this movie. It was better than the original, and I think it's one of the funniest movies of all time!The best part of this movie is when Wednesday and Pugsley go to camp, and stay dark while the other campers are cheery. This movie deserves to be on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list.",Addams Family Values

133,RenT17,Addams Family Values Should be Every Family's Values,8,1 November 2017,"The movie opens up with the vast dark sky lit only by a ghastly pale full moon and the howling of a ""wolf"", but quickly the audience is completely taken out of the dreary mood by discovering that the ""wolf"" that was howling is actually a short, bald-headed man, screeching on top of a roof. Addams Family Values is the perfect blend of family and dark humor. The film is drenched with verbal and situational irony—as great comedies should be —to heighten the extremities of the Addams family's preferences and tastes. Needless to say, the world is a little to bright and sunny for them. After watching the movie, it will seem a little too bright and sunny to you as well! One of the opening lines of the movie is Morticia Addams (the mother) saying calmly to her husband, ""Gomez, I'm going to have a baby, rightnow."" The movie then jumps into a sequence of rapid montage shots: Morticia being rushed into the hospital with a smirk on her face, Motricia and Gomez talking about how much Morticia is enjoying the pain she is experiencing, and cutting to Wednesday and Pugsley Addams in the waiting room. While a bubbly and excited girl sits across from them in the waiting room, she excitedly explains to them where babies come from. Her story consists of unicorns, fairies, and magic. After listening with a melancholy face, Wednesday responds to the little girl, ""our parents had sex."" The movie is rated PG-13 for ""language, smoking, sensuality and some bloody comic violence."" If this movie isn't on your go-to Halloween family movies list, you are missing out on a belly full of laughs!",Addams Family Values
134,xchic_,Amazing!,9,8 August 2005,"Okay I loved this movie! Each time I watch it, I find myself with stitches in my side. Not only is it funny it just has a great plot. With an all star cast that makes this movie just so classic. Always a great watch, even with the family! Christina Ricci is awesome in this movie. One of her first but for wasn't her last. She stole the show with her witty remarks and sarcasm at almost every scene. Great movie. What else can I say about this movie? Well I do find it to be better than ""the Addams family"" I'm not the usual horror freak who loves movies like this but then again ""Addams family values"" is not just a horror flick, it's also a great fun-loving comedy.. with a little wickedness for old good fun. Wow great movie 5 stars =)",Addams Family Values
135,rosella05,"a classic, the start of the great sequels",8,23 August 2006,"""Be afraid, be very afraid."" This hysterical movie emerged during an era when they were not only ameliorating the craft of the sequel, but transforming it forever. Moviegoers were guaranteed to waste their money on sequels like Porky's II, Grease II, Revenge of the Nerd II, III and somebody explain to me any of the Police Academy sequels. Then arose from the ashes, the Phoenix of sequel classics such as Addams Family Values. Instead of joke leftovers, served with a dubious sauce, we are treated with lines like, ""Lurch, was she in there before you baked (the cake)?"" We get a 2nd helping of the same actress who played the Girl Scout in movie 1. Who can forget, ""Is your lemonade made from real lemons?"" Wednesday replies dryly, ""Are your cookies made from real Girl Scouts?"" Maybe Wednesday is thinking of baking a batch after our girl scout is burned at the stake (apple in WASP mouth). Wonderful cast with Nathan Lane and Carol Kane popping in for a spell. You're going to die laughing.",Addams Family Values
136,tpkasept,Just saw again,9,12 November 2005,"Just saw 'AFV' again after a number of years... Truly hysterical with unlimited nuanced laughs. Some highlights..Debbie's makeover of Fester when she is unsuccessful killing him on their honeymoon..The unending one-line zingers distributed for delivery by everyone in the cast..Lurch playing 'Sunrise, Sunset' on the organ before Debbie and Fester wed, as well as the TV series ""dah, dah, dah, dum"" flourishes during Mendolson's March...Every scene at Camp Chippewa.. the Harmony Hut.. the Pagent.. Wednesday's 'smile', 'ghost story', etc.. In fact, EVERY moment Christina Ricci is on screen. That she will be able to see herself forever as Wednesday Addams is immensely amusing. She owns the film, it was her 5th feature film, and is my favorite performance of hers until Buffalo 66 and The Opposite of Sex..Baby Pubert turning ""cute"" and the ensuing horror..The cameos by Shaloub, Lane, Sonnenfeld, Hyde-Pierce, etc., as well as another excellent 'type-cast' performance by the steady David Krumholtz, (as Joel Glicker), who has been able to age well in the entertainment industry..Quality reprisals by Huston, Kane, Lloyd and the late, wonderful Raul Julia..Just a terrific execution by Sonnenfeld, Rudnik, Peterman (cinematographer), Adam and Durrell (art/set design)..",Addams Family Values
