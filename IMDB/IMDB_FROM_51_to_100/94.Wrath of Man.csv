0,SnoopyStyle,Ritchie does another crime thriller,7,27 May 2021,"In L. A., an armored truck is robbed and the two drivers are killed. Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) barely passes the tests to be the new hire at the company. When his truck gets hit, he turns into the Terminator.This is a Guy Ritchie film. It's a mid-level action thriller. It mostly works although it insists on following the story from all sides which leaves the film at almost two hours. By grouping the different sides separately, they do feel a bit split especially the story of the robbers. I do wonder if the search for the inside man would be a more compelling path. Ritchie is trying for a tighter thriller than his usual. It's him slimmed down. He uses his action skills but this is not going to be considered one of his best or most inventive.",Wrath of Man
1,boblipton,Too Uniformly Grim,5,8 May 2021,"Jason Statham get a job with an armored car company in Los Angeles. After extensive testing and training, he is assigned to work with Holt McCallany. Despite barely passing the tests, when a hold up is tried, Statham kills all six bad guys singlehandedly. We then get a forty-minute side story on Why Statham Is Not Who He Seems To Be And Who He Really Is.It's a remake of a French thriller, and give the bad guys, it would seem to be just director Guy Ritchie's meat. The problem I have with it is Statham. He doesn't have a wide range, but he's very good at playing bad guys. Unfortunately this role is too comfortable for him, and Ritchie doesn't even attempt to slip some of his humor into the piece. As a result, it's just one big ball of misery and bloodshed throughout, with little variation.",Wrath of Man
2,nogodnomasters,"Let the Painter, Paint.",6,11 June 2021,"Patrick Hill (Jason Stratham) joins Fortico Security a few months after they had an armed robbery with people dying. It is clear he is a ""dark horse"" doing some undercover work, but we don't discover what the back story is until the screen flashes ""Five Months Earlier."" At this point, what was a simple plot becomes slightly confusing.Jason plays the no emotion ""reptile"" Jason, shooting everyone in his path. At least he doesn't lose a limb and puts it back on with superglue and a needle and thread. They build up ""Hot Betty"" and then we never see her. I was also confused about a line in the opening scene about backup at Fenway. The film takes place in Los Angeles.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. Brief back nudity.",Wrath of Man
3,kosmasp,Path(s) of Man,9,21 July 2021,"Jason Statham and Guy Ritchie ... some might call them a dream team. And while Jason has the looks and drive to feel like an action ""hero"" of the past - he also has quite the talent to be above that cliche. We know him and even at the beginning of this, when no one of the other characters seem to know what they are dealing with - the audience knows there is more to the man, than we are shown.Having said that, this apparently is a remake of a movie, that as you can tell, I have not seen yet. The original allegedly has more humor and story - which may be true -- I just know that the humor and fun is really wedged and almost entirely put into the first fourth of the movie ... before the action starts to kick in ... quite literally. Although it is more gun play overall.An interesting story even if it seem to have gigantic holes ... but we take them with a spoon full of sugar ... and just let the movie works its magic. Relentless and focused on one thing ... and one thing alone ... the drive and motivation become clear ... and you may even root for him ... despite certain things - like a psych evaluation being necessary to name just one! Since the action is more than rock solid, all is good. And Scott Eastwood ... it's one thing to follow in your fathers footsteps (Clint, but you knew that hopefully), but a different thing to not just have the looks, but the charisma, acting ability and the overall screen presence to warrant that ... he is a bit underused in this, but even so fantastic nonetheless.",Wrath of Man
4,paul_haakonsen,Quite entertaining...,7,28 August 2021,"Well, wow. Just wow. Guy Ritchie does it again.I have to say that if you enjoy movies from director Guy Ritchie or enjoy movies that has Jason Statham on the cast list, then you definitely have to sit down to watch the 2021 action crime thriller ""Wrath of Man"". This movie was through the roof.The title of the movie, though, was something that sort of gave off a biblical vibe, so I personally didn't think it was a title suitable for this particular movie.The storyline, as written by Guy Ritchie, was one that swept me up from the very beginning and took me along on a very exciting thrill ride. And I do like the fact that the movie wasn't all that linear and predictable. Writer and director Guy Ritchie managed to come up with something that is every bit as much action packed as it is intense. And that made for a very enjoyable movie.""Wrath of Man"" has a rather impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Jason Statham, Holt McCallany, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and Andy Garcia, along with others that were also nicely cast. I must say that Jason Statham was really good in this movie. But I was very thrilled with the performance that Scott Eastwood put on, he was just phenomenal in ""Wrath of Man"".And the character gallery in ""Wrath of Man"" was quite well written, and there were some very interesting and nicely detailed characters throughout the movie.This movie provided me with genuine entertainment from the very beginning and up to the very end. So this is indeed a movie that I can - and will - warmly recommend you sit down to watch, should you find yourself presented with the opportunity to do so.My rating of ""Wrath of Man"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",Wrath of Man
5,searchanddestroy-1,Best of both Statham and Ritchie,10,18 July 2021,"Though both don't give here an usual performance, if you compare with what they did before. Nothing at all. This looks more like a Walter Hill's film than a Ritchie's one. In the style, it is far far closer to EXTREME PREJUDICE than to SNATCH, in terms of narrative grammar. Definitely. At first, I was sooo scared when they talked about a remake of Nicolas Boukrief's LE CONVOYEUR, so scared...Of course it is different, but maybe even better, and I would have never bet a dime on it. So, what a surprise, in this topic, very unusual, where you deal with several groups, several points of views, where Statham, for once since CRAZY JOE, doesn't play Statham, where you have no good vs evil men, everyone is more or less rotten, and no romance either. Yes, it is a damn good remake, I am nearly ashamed to have been angry about this remake before seeing it; but LE CONVOYEUR is an iconic movie for me. The military robbers group is very well shown, with their families, birthday party, with wives and kids, so we feel empathy for themn though they are the Statham's enemies. That's precisely what I love. Yes, yes yes, tha's the first Guy Ritchie film that I love, and unfortunately maybe the last. A terrific crime flick. A lost gem from Australia and made in 1979, MONEY MOVERS, offers also a very close topic, with also a bloody climax taking place in a security complex facility.",Wrath of Man
6,zardoz-13,Top-Notch Action Remake of the French Original,10,26 May 2021,"British writer & director Guy Ritchie ranks as one of the undisputed masters of crime movies, and ""Wrath of Man"" lives up to his reputation both for its violent R-rated bloodbaths and its stoic action star Jason Statham. Statham reminds me of tough guy superstar Charles Bronson with his Neanderthal looks and his ripped physique. This gritty armored car robbery & revenge caper marks the fourth time Ritchie and Statham have collaborated since ""Revolver"" (2005), ""Snatch"" (2000), and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998). Unlike Martin Scorsese, our own Oscar-winning cinematic godfather of crime, who specializes in mob movies, Ritchie displays greater range and versatility. Along with his contemporary brass knuckled thrillers, like ""RocknRolla"" (2008) with Gerard Butler and the Matthew McConaughey marihuana melodrama ""The Gentlemen"" (2018), Ritchie has no problem rotating between the past, with his two Robert Downey, Jr., ""Sherlock Holmes"" whodunits, and the present, with his big-screen adaptation of ""The Man from U. N. C. L. E."" (2015). Not only does ""Wrath of Man"" differ because it is set on our side of the Atlantic, but it also abstains from comic antics. Composer Christopher Benstead punctuates the bullet-blasting skirmishes with an ominous orchestral score. Meantime, Statham is never less than serious, and Ritchie's nimble direction covers the basics and integrates flashbacks into the narrative. He surrounds Statham with a seasoned ensemble cast featuring Holt McCallany, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan, and Scott Eastwood. Incidentally, ""Wrath of Man"" is a remake of the 2004 French thriller ""Le Convoyeur,"" aka ""Cash Truck."" ""Cash Truck"" relied more on subtlety rather than slaughter.You can feel the firm hand of writer & director Guy Ritchie controlling every scene and performance. A slam-bang opening gambit lays the groundwork for everything which ensues. Ritchie orchestrates the complex action with a spontaneity the feels like a tire-iron across your knuckles. Rather than indulging in his penchant for visual flair, Ritchie endows the film with a flat, industrial factuality reminiscent of Jack Webb's black & white ""Dragnet"" (1954), except Ritchie lenses his pyrotechnics in color. As the film unfolds, Ritchie treats the audience as stowaways in an armored car, so we're eavesdropping on the guards as they amass their monetary cargo and chat about coffee. No sooner have they headed out on their next pick-up than the driver jams on his brakes. A safety worker wearing a white hard hat and lime vest flags the armored truck to a halt as a cement mixing truck whips across the street in front of it, blocking all passage. Swiftly, the guards alert their dispatcher that they are under attack. A blow torch blazes through one wall of the armored truck and cuts a hole in it. Stripping away the seared metal, the bandits seize money satchels by the dozen and order the driver and guard at gunpoint to exit the vehicle. Moments later utter chaos shatters tranquility. Confined as we are in the truck peering out through the front windshield, we cannot catch a glimpse of any gunplay. Nevertheless, the crash of gunfire is unmistakable. Later, we learn the guards were gunned down on the spot along with an innocent bystander who was forced to lie prone on the pavement.After this tragic opening scene, ""Wrath of Man"" gives us our first glimpse of Patrick Hill (Jason Statham), a quiet, solemn fellow who minds his own business. Hill saunters off the street into Fortico, a Los Angeles' armored car company, where he lands a security guard job. Hill's trainer warns him that recruits must score at least 70 percent in every category from driving to shooting. Otherwise, he must start anew again. Later, the movie flashbacks to 'five months previously,' which dominates the middle section of the action, before Ritchie resumes in the present.Patrick Hill listens to his supervisor, Terry (Eddie Marsan of ""Atomic Blonde""), as he sits across the desk from him. He maintains a blank expression. He resembles the thinker Rodan, except he doesn't prop his chin on his fist. Nothing phases Patrick. For all we know, ice water streams through his veins rather than warm blood. Later, during one of his first armored car pick-ups, Hill surprises his incredulous colleagues, Bullet (Holt McCallany of ""Fight Club"") and their driver Dave (Josh Hartnett of ""Black Hawk Down"") with his sharpshooting skills. Patrick foils a robbery alone as if he were Dirty Harry and kills all six assailants with flawlessly aimed head shots. Predictably, the Fortico owner and Hill's fellow security guards applaud Patrick when he returns from the field. Nevertheless, Hill doesn't let this praise interfere with his single-minded objective. He has embarked on a bloody crusade, and he is obsessed with achieving his objective no matter what the cost. Basically, Patrick wants to find closure in the face of a heartbreaking tragedy. Divulging further details about the complex plot and the repercussions that occur would spoil the big surprise.Not surprisingly, comparisons are inevitable between ""Wrath of Man"" and director Christian Gudegast's ""Den of Thieves"" (2018), toplining Gerard Butler and co-starring Pablo Schreiber. Actually, the two movies share a lot in common, though ""Wrath of Man"" surpasses ""Den of Thieves"" only by a couple of hair-triggers. If you haven't seen ""Den of Thieves,"" you've missed a treat. Butler is convincing as a loose cannon L. A. County Sheriff's Department Detective who hounds an elite crew of armored car outlaws. Like the guys in ""Den of Thieves,"" the armored car outlaws plan their hold-ups with the surgical exactitude. They have surveilled everything of interest before they launch strike. In ""Wrath of Man,"" the villains are brothers in their arms who served together in the same Army unit in Afghanistan. Some are just hopelessly bored with their uneventful lives, while others see crime as an avenue to lessen boredom. The ultimate surprise lurks within Patrick's inscrutable character, and it is Patrick's backstory as an 'apparent' hero that may catch audiences' off guard.",Wrath of Man
7,Calicodreamin,A well told action movie,8,11 May 2021,"Amazing storytelling jam packed with action. The cinematography was beautifully done, the way you're given different perspectives of the same scene, is so well done. The story unfolded in a captivating and compelling way. The acting was decent and the action coordination felt authentic.",Wrath of Man
8,ferguson-6,Ritchie playing it (mostly) straight,7,6 May 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Cinematic Alert: Guy Ritchie has gone straight! That's right, the filmmaker we've come to bank on for dynamic action, creative editing, and clever, rapid-fire dialogue laced with dark humor and outright hilarious, offbeat moments, has delivered a straightforward, by-the-book revenge-crime thriller. Of course, despite it being about as good as anything else in the genre, we just can't help but feel a little (and maybe a lot) disappointed that Ritchie has shifted his approach and left us wondering why. After all, he's the genius behind THE GENTLEMEN (2019), SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011), and SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), as well as his brilliant first two films: LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000).The film opens with an armored vehicle heist that ends in gunfire. This heist and the crew of criminals are the key to the story, and Ritchie utilizes his non-linear, multiple perspective story-telling technique to fill in the gaps for us and provide context to everything else that unfolds. Needless to say, there's more to this heist than what we initially witness. Jumping ahead a few months, the next thing we see is Jason Statham as the mysterious ""H"" joining Fortico, the cash truck/armored vehicle company victimized in that early sequence. H is clearly wound tightly and not great at making friends ... at least until his heroics thwart another attempted robbery and saves the lives of co-workers Bullet (Holt McCallany) and Boy Sweat Dave (Josh Hartnett).H's motivation is slowly revealed, as is the fact that he's not such an outstanding citizen himself. However, it's clear his mission of revenge is the most important thing in his life, and he'll stop at nothing to get the person he's after. His target is part of a criminal team of former military buddies that include Jackson (Jeffrey Donovan), Ian (Scott Eastwood), Brad (Deobia Oparei), and Sam (Raul Castillo), who want nothing more than one huge score so they can walk away and enjoy life. Other key members of Fortico's staff are played by Niahm Algar, Eddie Marsan, and Rob Delaney. H's contacts are played by Lyne Renee, Darrell D'Silva, and Andy Garcia, while singer Post Malone (billed as Austin Post) makes an appearance as a robber.Filmmaker Ritchie is working with many of his regular collaborators. He co-wrote the screenplay with Marn Davies and Ivan Atkinson, and it's based on the 2004 French movie, LE CONVOYEUR (""Cash Truck"") by Nicolas Boukhrief, Eric Besnard. Others from his usual team include cinematographer Alan Stewart, composer Christopher Benstead, and editor James Herbert. It's not unusual to find Jason Statham bring his action expertise to a Guy Ritchie crime movie, but Statham really plays it straight here as he sets out to settle a score. The almost non-existent wise-cracking leaves us feeling a bit adrift due to expectations, but the result is a fine, action-packed movie with one excessively long shootout near the end. Ritchie has certainly earned the right to make the movies he wants, but in the words of main character H, ""I do bear a grudge.""

9,bombersflyup,Decent.,6,3 June 2021,"Wrath of Man is an engaging action-thriller from start to finish, though lacking in memorable characters and moments.Statham's good, but his character gets shot up twice and keeps going like some terminator...",Wrath of Man
10,mm-39,Not bad!,7,4 July 2021,"Wrath of Man is a good movie. Not great but a solid Guy Richie movie. Wrath of Man has solid mechanical Guy Richie action sequences. Compared to Snatch and other Guy Richie movie Wrath of Man is average. But like other Guy Richie movies Wrath of Man has several stories intertwined together excellently. There is the story with of Jason's character, and a heist story going together with plot twists with other characters added to the story. The action, climax, mixed with grimy background makes for an alpha male calamity. Worth watching 7 stars.",Wrath of Man
11,deloudelouvain,"For a Guy Ritchie movie disappointing, for a Statham movie like usual.",6,13 July 2021,"Guy Ritchie is after Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers one of my favorite directors. With sublime movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and The Gentlemen, he's one of those directors you follow and are curious and excited about when a new movie comes out. But not all his movies are of the same quality. Like Sherlock Holmes for example (which I found mediocre) Wrath of Man is just passable. It's all well directed but the quality is just not there. And it's a movie with Jason Statham, so it speaks for itself what you will get. Statham never laughs, Statham can't be beaten, Statham wants revenge, in short Statham plays the same character every time. A bit like Liam Neeson. I don't say those are bad actors, certainly not, but it's just always the same. Wrath of Man is full of mindless action, a lot of dead people, a lot of questionable scenes (like the heist for example that looked like doomed to fail). I watched the movie trying not to yawn, I was hoping to get those great dialogues Guy Ritchie is known for, but that just never happened. Wrath of Man is just okay to watch once, but that's it, certainly not at the same level as the other movies from Guy Ritchie.",Wrath of Man
12,siderite,"Hard men, no compromises, great action... not much else",9,15 June 2021,"If you want a good action movie, this is it. No bull, no complicated back stories, no pointless characters added for diversity, no mercy with any of the others. Except one scene towards the end that had no right being there, it was a damn good movie. And might I add that I thought Jason Statham played the same tough invulnerable unshakeable guy, but differently. He put a ton of stoic pain in the acting that improved this film a lot.And that's the whole review, because other than good action and movie making, there is nothing else there. Perfection is reached when there is nothing else to remove.",Wrath of Man
13,FeastMode,Eh,5,9 May 2021,"It was fine. Just fine. Nothing new here. Nothing special. Could have been done better. There were a bunch of scenes where it was unclear what was happening or why. I did enjoy the musical score (1 viewing, 5/9/2021)",Wrath of Man
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A moody man in a moody movie.,5,27 July 2021,"Guy Ritchie's latest, a remake of 'Cash Truck (2004), focuses on a mysterious armoured vehicle driver who displays lethal proficiency whenever a truck he's in is targeted by armed robbers. The plot plays out in chapters, moving back and forth throughout time to reveal different layers to the characters and situation. It's a decent idea but it's executed a little poorly; Statham, the man we all came to see, sort of disappears for a large chunk of the 'Wrath Of Man (2021)', despite retaining protagonist status. Having said that, the flick does get better as it goes along and its weakest aspect is definitely its first, seemingly most straightforward segment. That's because it's basically just a bunch of guys making crude homophobic and sexist remarks as they go about their day job. Sure, there are one or two decent action sequences, but even these don't make up for just how monotonous it all is. It doesn't help that Statham is just playing a moody man in a moody movie, without a hint of the sort of self-awareness that makes his overly 'macho' aura work in other productions. It really is just a bit boring, and its perpetuation of the type of toxic masculinity that went out of fashion years ago (which continues throughout its run-time) actually makes it feel old-fashioned in the worst possible way. When its narrative starts to get a bit more involved, it does become a bit more engaging. It tries to develop its side characters enough so that you care when some of them inevitably die, which is appreciated even if it doesn't quite work. The action in the latter half of the picture is more compelling than that in its first and the filmmaking, in general, is on point throughout. Sadly, its revenge element doesn't have the impact it should because the person getting revenge hasn't been developed as a character for quite some time (so, even though he's physically there during the finale, he lacks any semblance of presence). That's the problem with the whole affair, really: it lacks impact. Even at its best, it's just the sort of thing that unfolds in front of you and immediately slips from your mind. It's a self-serious slog for much of its run-time. Even though it has its more successful moments, I wouldn't really recommend it. 5/10.",Wrath of Man
15,A_Different_Drummer,broken promises!,7,30 May 2021,"The first 20 minutes hooks you. It promises a movie which you will never actually get to see and which doesn't even really exist.

16,westsideschl,A Little Bit Violent,8,24 August 2021,"A bit violent, but for the most part we're spared the visuals. A few twists thus a slightly complex storyline made even more so by flashbacks, but somewhat clear as to time & characters (often in movies they're not). Major negatives: I got lost on a couple of character backgrounds & our lead character seemed movie fictional impervious to harm.",Wrath of Man
17,The-Sarkologist,Another Ritchie Gem,9,5 May 2021,"I've always liked a Guy Ritchie film, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. In fact it seems as if he gets more traction if he makes a film that isn't necessarily based on well known characters (considering that King Arthur really didn't go down all that well), though even if he does make a film that flops, he always manages to pick himself up again and make something different. In fact, he seems to be able to survives flops that would be career ending for some directors.Anyway, this film is set in Los Angeles and is basically about this guy that becomes a security guard in a cash truck. At first he seems to just fit the bill, that is until the truck that he is in is held up by some gangsters, and he suddenly shows his true colours. So, who is this guy? Well, we are given a bit of a look in since the film does jump about, building up the story bit by bit, but we never actually find out what occupation that he used to be in (though there are some suspicions).While the story behind the film is pretty well known, I personally don't want to give too much away, since going into this film with only the knowledge that Jason Statham stars in it, and Guy Ritchie directed it, is basically all we really need to know. Knowing nothing else actually adds to the enjoyment of the film, not that it twists and turns, but rather it reveals things in a peacemeal way that brings you to the point where pretty much everything comes clear at the end.I have to admit that I really do like these non-linear films, especially when they are done right, and Guy Ritchie is definitely knows how to do this, and do this well. Like some of his other films, it is episodic, which is why the film gets away with being non-linear, but it also means that the background is slowly released until the big finale.This is basically a heist movie, something that Ritchie seems to be able to do quite well. Sure, some of his other ones have fallen rather flat, but as far as I'm concerned, when Ritchie is the brains behind the entire show, then you are in for one hell of a ride, and I have to admit this this film is definitely one hell of a ride.",Wrath of Man

He is cold and mysterious, and his colleagues do not know anything about him.I have to admit that I did not expect from this movie to be so good. The plot was very interesting and it contained some plot twists that I did not expect, something that made it even more interesting. The combination of mystery and action along with drama has this nice result. The interpretation of Jason Statham who played as H was for one more time very good and as a protagonist made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Holt McCallany's who played as Bullet, Scott Eastwood's who played as Jan and Josh Hartnett's who played as Boy Sweat Dave. All in all, I have to say that ""Wrath of Man"" is a nice action movie to spend your time with and especially if you are a fan of Jason Statham movies.",Wrath of Man

22,eddie_baggins,A gritty old-school crime thriller with a killer Statham performance,7,29 April 2021,"Sticking to the lower budget roots that got him a start in a big way thanks to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, Guy Ritchie has followed up his minor but well-received The Gentleman with Wrath of Man, a crime thriller that sees the divisive but entertaining director get his favorite lad Jason Statham back on leading man duties.The last time these two long term friends teamed up was for the near forgotten about Revolver, a film that is actually a lot better than you may remember it being, and Wrath of Man is far more straight forward than that affair, with Ritchie remaking European film Cash Truck to deliver a hard-boiled and gritty 90's like action/thriller that gives Statham some of his best material in years.It may surprise many that this reforming of Ritchie and Statham see's the usually flamboyant director dial things back a notch or two with his hyperkinetic visuals and edits few and far between here and his cockney tinged humor reigned right in as we instead get a mostly humorous free affair following Statham's mysterious H in a new job for a cash truck company that has recently been hit by a deadly heist and seems destined to be targeted once more by a group of elite robbers looking to make a quick buck.With some bleak but atmospheric cinematography from Alan Stewart, some moody and effective scoring from composer Christopher Benstead and some grizzled performances from co-stars Holt McCallany, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and for what feels like the first appearance in eons from Josh Hartnett, Wrath of Man is a solid all round package that benefits from Ritchie's experience hands as he delivers a non-linear examination of what lead H down this new employment path and who exactly is behind a string of well-oiled robberies taking place across Los Angeles.There's certainly nothing new or unique about Wrath of Man's central plot or the moments that litter its runtime, in many ways this the definition of a vengeance/crime thriller rulebook in action but there's a sheen and professionalism on display throughout the film and with Statham having an absolute blast (figuratively and at times literally) being back with one of his longest serving collaborators and with some genuinely great set-pieces that ramp up to a pulse-pounding finale, Wrath of Man may not be top-shelf Ritchie, but its top-class crime thriller fare that will please all genre diehards.Final Say -Refrained Ritchie with just enough pizazz and flair to make you remember whose behind the camera, Wrath of Man is a throwback crime thriller with a killer lead character and some great set-ups, making this a consistently fun and impressively filmed watch without ever doing anything of a true noteworthy nature.3 1/2 burritos out of 5.",Wrath of Man

26,imseeg,"I have seen ALL of Jason Statham movies and this one isnt a gem, to put it politely...",6,24 June 2021,"Seen it all before, done better by Jason Statham himself. Even the director Guy Ritchie (ex husband Madonna) didnt show any of his usual visual trickery and flashy style of filming.The bad: mediocre supporting B-actors, who do get a lot of screentime unfortunatley. The story is the same old gangster story, without ANY surprises at all. There are NO jokes at all. The action scenes are not particularly impressive, which is kind odd for such a visually talented director. Concluding: I have seen all of Jason Statham's movies and this Jason Statham picture is incredibly MEDIOCRE... barely worthy of the six stars...Any good? Yes, it is another tough Jason Statham movie about a tough guy killing other tough guys. However mediocre this movie might be, it isnt irritating to a level that I cant watch it.

Actually, that's not entirely accurate, cause this movie had so much style and Richie is about that, but the dark tone that makes up this crime drama seemed out of the ordinary for a man whose movies tend to have a sense of humor and adventure. This is not that, this movie is pure revenge.Statham plays a mysterious man who gets a job at a security company that specializes in armor trucks, a cold harded man on a mission and the fun of this movie is watching that mission unravel in the coolest way possible.It was gritty and the ensemble cast which features Josh Hartnett and Scott Eastwood was absolutely fantastic. It moves dramatically slow, but the energy is keeps it moving and its exciting.So far my favorite movie of 2021.",Wrath of Man
28,jtindahouse,As good as action films get,10,26 May 2021,"I remember saying in my 'The Gentlemen' review that I wished Guy Ritchie would only make this type of movie from here on out. He's usually pretty good at whatever he does, but when he tackles the crime/action genre it is something few filmmakers can match. Not only has he continued to make that style of movie, he has taken a step better than the brilliant film that was 'The Gentlemen'. This time around it is a remake of a French film - and all that says to me is that I need to see that French film now. This was a brilliant ride.The film opens with a very strange opening scene. We only get one camera view of what is going on which seems very strange at the time (all is revealed later on), but even with the little that we get to see Ritchie's style shines through and we immediately know we are in for a treat. We then meet Jason Statham's character. I have seen a lot of Statham movies over the years and I think this might just be both his best work yet, and also his most badass role. He was unreal in this film.The pacing of this movie is incredible. Nearly two hours and I guarantee you won't check your watch once. If you need to pass two hours by as quickly as humanly possible then put on this film. I can't recommend this one highly enough. See it immediately.",Wrath of Man

The first half it's a revenge plot, then the second half it's a heist plot. Jason Statham is not terrible. But I was wish he showed more humanity in his role, at times he's a little too stoic. But actors Josh Hartnett, and Jeffrey Donovan are pretty good, but let's forget. Scott Eastwood who also shines has a gun totting psychopath, getting out of his famous fathers shadow.",Wrath of Man

It is a remake of a 2004 French movie called 'Le Convoyeur'-Cash Truck-and is about a gang that hits cash trucks operating in the Los Angeles area. The trucks carry lots of money-in the millions-from casinos, banks, etc. Jason's son is killed during one of the heists as an innocent bystander and Jason wants revenge-Duh! His plan involves getting a job at the truck company-he thinks there may be an insider helping them-and he plans on following the trail back to the future dead people. Josh plays a fellow truck guard, Jeffrey is the leader of the bad guys and Scott plays one of the bad guys-he is really, really bad, in fact he even has a scar on his face. Lots of action, several twists and a few cameos-I remember seeing Andy Garcia and if you pay close attention to robber number 6, he is played by Austin Post, aka Post Malone.It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Wrath of Man

35,kirbylee70-599-526179,BACK AND FORTH,9,9 August 2021,"I've long been a fan of director Guy Richie. With the exception of SWEPT AWAY I've enjoyed all of his films. Be it Sherlock Holmes, the man from U. N. C. L. E. Or his exceptional British crime dramas like LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRLES or SNATCH, all have offered exceptional entertainment. Richie was the first to really see the potential of Jason Statham and the pair have worked on 4 films together. Including this week's pick WRATH OF MAN.The story bounced back and forth in time from various perspectives all telling the same story. Richie does an exceptional job presenting this tale and doing so in a method that doesn't prove to be distracting or too complicated. Instead this method helps move the story forward. The only thing it makes difficult is writing about it without revealing too much. So please bear with me.The film opens with the heist of an armored car and the killing of two guards. The action is quite put on display but the voiceovers of the criminals involved gives us what is happening. The guards and two bystanders are shot during the heist.Fast forward a few months and there is a new hire for the same armored car company. Statham plays Patrick Hill, called H by his mentor Bullet (Holt McCallany). His first day on the job he's given a hard time by a driver named Dave (Josh Harnett). When paired with him on a run a few weeks later, Dave is the one that is too nervous to move while Hill comes out of the truck with a plan in mind that results in the robbers all being killed.But there is more to Hill than being a simple truck guard. We discover that the two victims shot in that opening heist were Hill and his son. It turns out that he himself was part of a large crew that robbed armored cars. He was doing the team robbing that truck a favor as eyes on the street but they didn't know who he was. Once he recovered, he and his crew set out to find out who it was that shot and killed his son.The third story taking place here is that of the thieves who did the original heist. This is a team of ex-military men led by Jackson (Jeffrey Donovan). Feeling rejected and underappreciated by the country that sent them to Afghanistan, looking for action and a way to make money they come up with the plan to rob armored cars. Jackson has a man on the inside to help them but won't tell the others who it is. The biggest problem this team faces is the uncontrollable Jan (Scott Eastwood).All of these story elements are presented in four distinct chapters of the film ending with the fourth that pulls them altogether. Each story is singular in itself and Richie does an amazing job of wrapping them around one another to tell a more complete story. The action is plentiful and the violence is brutal but fans of Richie have come to expect that. This is not a story for the squeamish and truth be told not many will make it out of the film alive. But that presents a more realistic world rather than a movie, a world where people die as a result of their actions.Statham does a great job in this film. He's plaid stoic characters in films before but never as much as he does here. His focus is straight on and those who cross him will pay the price, even if they are part of the same criminal world he is from. Donovan does a solid job as well but for me he felt underused. His character had so little to draw from. Eastwood on the other hand played the crazed killer with enough restraint that it became believable. The son of Clint he's making a name for himself on his own terms and this movie should help that along.In the end I found the film to capture my interest from start to finish. There was no time that I found myself bored or reaching for the remote and the fast forward button. That's a rarity these days. The film didn't feel like it had filler involved, no ten minute repetitive car chases that become tedious to those of us who watch movies all the time. Instead it was a movie that I know I could watch again with ease. My suggestion is that you make the time to do so at least once.",Wrath of Man

He definitely motivated Jason to give one if his best performances, I believe this is the 1st Jason film where he doesn't use martial arts.

39,questl-18592,Wrath of Critic,4,29 October 2021,"I bet there's a good movie buried in this thing, I just don't think Guy Ritchie can unearth it. From the jump, the acting felt amateurish, the dialogue clunky and forced. Statham is solid but that's not really saying much because he's basically just playing his usual tough guy badass role, which normally I'm in for but he's lost in the shuffle of this movie. The whole second act is a muddled jumble of time jumps. 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 8 months ago, a week ago. Whatever it actually was it felt like in the course of 20 minutes I experienced 5 timelines and I was getting whiplash being yanked around so much.It's not that it's hard to follow either, which is part of the problem. This is a basic revenge story. But, it's trying to put on airs of being something more. It reminds me of that Gerard Butler flick, Den of Thieves, in a way. It spends so much time going into the background and origin of the ""good guy"" and the ""bad guys"" that it loses what should have been a very straightforward movie. Instead, somone (Most likely Ritchie) thought they were clever and tried to reach way to far with this and, in the process, torpedo'd the whole thing.I legitimately don't get how these movies keep making this mistake. You have John Wick as a recent template. Hell, I'll even go a step further back to a Statham original, The Transporter. You can do a slick, gritty revenge action movie without having to invest tons of time in backstory. I don't need to know every detail of my lone gunman. In fact, if the movie's done halfway decently, NOT telling me everything actually leaves me more invested and hungry for a potential sequel. A compelling idea will carry the picture. I don't need to know every detail of my lone gunman. This had an interesting hook. I wish it would've had a director that could have properly set it and brought it to fruition.",Wrath of Man
40,valleyjohn,No your typical Guy Ritchie film.,8,5 July 2021,"If I hadn't known before hand , I would have never guessed that this was a Guy Ritchie movie . The only thing in common with this and his back catalogue is Jason Statham.Statham plays a man dubbed H, a cold and mysterious character working at a cash truck company responsible for moving hundreds of millions of dollars around Los Angeles each week but there is far more to H than meets the eye.This is dark . Very dark . It doesn't have the humour or fancy camera work we associate with Guy Ritchie action movies and I didn't have a problem with that at all.There are a whole heap of well known faces on show . Josh Hartnett , Andy Garcia , Eddie Marsan, Jeffrey Donovan and Scott Eastwood looking more and more like his old man every film he does.The action is relentless.

41,AudioFileZ,Not a Guy Richie Caper Retread...All Dark Without Any Humor,6,10 May 2021,"It's conceivable Guy Richie would make this film. He's a crime caper filmmaker so, yes, it's the same genre. Understandably he doesn't want to always make the same film and this one is differentIt's particularly dark, but again that's to be expected. What seems wholly different is there is no attempt at comic relief whatsoever. With a violent start it just goes darker and darker.What there is, however, is a flawed hero. Jason Statham. His character ""H"" isn't particularly likeable, yet you root for his one-man rendering of justice. Statham is the perfect actor for this shade of Richie. The film doesn't let up so the right-brain doesn't pick it apart and the viewer is in for a fairly rough ride. It's a film that is light on any entertainment in lieu of a black revenge. As such it may limit it's audience, but as previously stated it's Riichie plumbing of the depths of violent acts and equally violent revenge. I don't think it's for everyone as such, but Statham carries the water keeping the viewer invested as the choas and violence flows like a river.",Wrath of Man

Not much of an action Film
Extremely Loud EffectsSUMMARY/VerdictRitchie's class in storytelling comes through in Wrath of Man, working to once more add storytelling, drama, and action into a balanced film. Use of dynamic, yet stable, camera work elevates the feel of the film, granting us with danger and heart in a genre that often lacks this. This film helps expand much on the sequences by bringing multiple aspect together to help give the full picture, all while keeping an underlying mystery to bridge everything together and keep the tales running in parallel up to the very end. An exciting climax helps wrap things up, but never without sacrificing the rules established in the tale and losing the class it worked hard to maintain leading to a very satisfying ending for this reviewer. True there are some moments where the balanced writing veers, and some excessive sequences or approaches get in the way of adding more action, but these are relatively limited consequences given the storytelling involved. My main complaint came with the constant time hopping we had, still understandable, but a bit annoying to put tales on hold and randomly set a new starting point to move about instead of getting on with the tale. Otherwise, this movie is definitely one for an audience member looking for dark drama with a touch of thriller/action, with plenty of value to visit the local movie theater for a watch.

The French version is more of a minimalist drama cum thriller and this is a Jason Statham all out action film you cannot compare the two in the least!The French version to be honest I found very slow and a tad boring at times but it is more true to life; the main protagonist cannot fire a gun, there are no guns a bazooka shootouts and most of the security guards spend the day smoking dope and popping pills, there is even one scene smoking hash thought the barrel of a shotgun , so no Jason Statham he is not he is just an ordinary guy who lost his son and the end sequence is rather miserable and sad unlike this so you cannot compare the two at All.",Wrath of Man

[+52%]",5,26 May 2021,"As a Statham-Ritchie action vehicle (within the comfort zone of both dudes), I expected more out of Wrath of Man than the generic drivel I was subjected to. It is both a heist and a revenge flick rolled into one, sans the situational dank humour or the quirky one-liners. Here, Ritchie's buzzy visuals and crisp, action-packed montages are replaced by plain, unsophisticated shots that serve only to expound. By the beginning of the second act (each act with a distinct title-card, serving no real purpose - not even subtly allegorical), Wrath of Man becomes riddled with plot convenience, as opposed to Ritchie's usual writing style where characters organically go through do-or-die situations.The non-linear storytelling doesn't help. Not only does it rob us of all the layers of mystery that Ritchie sets us up with in the first half-hour, but it also makes the latter acts expository as hell. The dialogues, a Guy Ritchie strongpoint, are astonishingly dull this time around. So many loose threads are left hanging by the time the film gets to its finale - several decisions, especially by the antagonists, don't seem like ones that supposedly smart criminals would take. Christopher Benstead's brooding score, while intriguing in the first act, becomes repetitive and undermines the overall impact. Statham and the supporting ensemble do a fine job, but I wish there was more (meat) to the film than what I watched.",Wrath of Man
49,leftbanker-1,Guy Ritchie Makes an Itchy and Scratchy Movie Staring Jason Statham,1,27 May 2021,"One more lousy action film with a plot that has yet another hole punched in it with every shot fired-and there are a lot of shots fired. These movies need to come with a count that shows total people killed and rounds fired. This was Ritchie's homage to Michael Mann's Heat. Ritchie comes up empty handed.You know the brand, the movies where Statham is such a tough guy that bullets are afraid to hit him. He goes up against highly-trained ex-military criminals, yet his are the only bullets that can hit their targets. And he's so cool that he shoots a pistol with one hand.The final heist scene was REALLY stupid. For arch-criminals making a plan, it wasn't much of a plan at all, at least one that had the slightest chance of success. Basically, they walk into an armored car company's cash depot and have a shootout. While waiting for the police to arrive.There were a lot of dumb characters, but my favorite was the cowardly lion.The soundtrack was weak, like listening to a slight variation of the ""Song of the Volga Boatmen"" on a constant loop. The title is also sorta dumb.The zigzagging timeline thing got old almost immediately: three months ago, five months later, yesterday, and whatever. Should I write all of this down to keep score? Sometimes flashbacks are necessary, but to use them as a gimmick is annoying.The really stupid aspect of the movie is its raison d'être. Wait for it...it's a revenge fantasy. How original. Of course, this means we have to introduce the person being avenged, in this case his estranged son. If he loved the kid so much, maybe he should have stayed with the mother...and not chosen a life of violent crime. ""He killed my son whom I see twice a year by order of my divorce decree."" The final act of revenge in these tales is always supposed to come as some sort of cinematic answer to the orgasm. In this case, as with most films of this ilk, you'd think this climax was written by a prepubescent kid who's never had one before. I didn't feel anything except relief that it was finally over.By the way, his name was Doogie Howser.",Wrath of Man

53,IonicBreezeMachine,Guy Ritchie reunites with Jason Statham to deliver a hard hitting white knuckle revenge thriller with Statham's best performance since The Bank Job.,8,25 July 2021,"Patrick ""H"" Hill (Jason Statham) obtains a job at Fortico Security after barely passing the certification with average scores. When H's truck is attacked by armed robbers, H exhibits precision marksmanship and takedowns of the robbers to the amazement of his partners, ""Bullet""(Holt McCallany) and ""Boy Sweat"" (Josh Hartnett). While Fortico is more than happy to take H's effortless takedown of the armed robbers as a massive PR win, H's fellow security officers grow suspicious regarding H's true intentions.The first collaboration between Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham since 2005's Revolver, Wrath of Man sees Ritchie's post Aladdin comeback that began with The Gentleman continue as Ritchie gives us a remake of 2004 French thriller, Cash Truck (Le Conveyor), updated with his signature style and a commanding performance by Statham. While the marketing has positioned Wrath of Man almost as a Taken-style bare basics action thriller, the movie's actually more than it's impressions let on and if you can go into it blind I highly recommend doing so.The opening scene where we get a view of a brutal heist from a POV inside the cash truck is one of the most chilling and tense opening sequences I can recall seeing in a movie of this type. This opening sets the stage for the rest of the movie where it's pretty much ongoing tension broken up by sudden outbreaks of intense confrontations that are well staged and effectively brutal. The movie does well playing up the mystery aspects of its premise with H's motivations remaining a mystery to the audience for quite awhile before we're aware what he's doing. With a lesser actor this wouldn't have worked, but thanks to Statham's performance and Ritchie's direction, H serves as a strong central point the movie builds itself upon.Statham is absolutely fantastic playing ""H"" with his brash antihero persona put to really good use in a way that's reminiscent of his performance in 2006's The Bank Job. Statham effortlessly brings his acerbic wit to the role and also plays up the simmering intensity that's always boiling beneath the surface. It's a strong reminder of just how great an actor Statham can be and why his work with Ritchie is still reliable all these years later.What criticisms I have are fairly minor. The dialogue is good, but sometimes it tries a bit too hard to be clever such as an exchange in tying H's name to ""walking on water""(makes more sense in the movie) that seems fine on paper but doesn't come off as well as it should. The movie also has a non linear narrative that I thought was put to mostly good use, but certain plot points regarding H's past and some other characters tied to his agenda I felt were slightly murky and could've been expanded upon.Wrath of Man sees Ritchie and Statham firing on all cylinders in a well made thriller that is rich in tension. Anchored by a strong central performance from Statham and an intriguing mystery the movie takes the strengths of all its individual parts and comes together for a satisfying ride.",Wrath of Man

Maybe I'm saying it could have been a better mini series because we've been spending a lot of time on TV lately,, but being one of the last MGM projects before giving the keys to Amazon, who knows what could happen :DThe plot is very good,, splitting the movie in chapters moving back and forth in timeline and staying till the last minutes before showing all the cards.. the script looked fine even for a two hours movie it did not seem long or dull at all.. the directing style of Guy Ritchie is showing with the mysterious shots that carefully reveals the plot bit by bit.The cast was well.. need I say more !! Jason Statham is one of the Expendables .. I love his serious acting wouldn't mind a little ""Crank"" humor but nevertheless he was amazing being ""the boss"".. Holt McCallany and the others were also good, Scott Eastwood character was weird , though I wanted to see more of Josh Hartnett ..Anyway, no need to write more and more, The movie is very recommended. Go watch it now.",Wrath of Man
56,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A mediocre Guy Ritchie heist film.,6,14 September 2021,"Back in the early 2010s, I found myself drawn to Guy Ritchie's films. Lately, though, I've been disappointed in what I've gotten. I can probably pinpoint the downturn with King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017). While Aladdin (2019) mostly worked due to its source material, films like The Gentlemen (2020) felt off. There's a visual charm to a Guy Ritchie film that has been missing as of late. Of course, visuals are only half of what made his early films great. It's that ""can't take yourself too seriously"" attitude that seems to have been lost since then.While it's great to see Ritchie working with long-time collaborator Jason Statham again, I had the distinct feeling that I had seen Wrath of Man (2021) before when I rented it from Redbox. When the first 30 minutes of the film can be succinctly captured by a 2-minute trailer, then we have a problem. The fact that this same heist is repeated three times from different points of view made this almost 2-hour movie seem endless. Sure, I liked the little twists that revealed H's (Statham) motivations, but overall it felt too repetitive for me to care.In fact, while the action was quite entertaining (especially once we got past the heist), the motivations of some of the characters felt a little too on-the-nose for a post-January 6th world. Unfortunately, because of these revelations throughout the film, it always has to take itself so seriously. Long gone are the goofy little bits like in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) that made a Guy Ritchie film fun to watch instead of a slog to get through. But at least the visuals are starting to return to some of his previous, flashy stylings.A mediocre Guy Ritchie heist film, I give Wrath of Man 3.0 stars out of 5.",Wrath of Man
57,Holt344,"Guy Ritchie have created a film worth watching on the big screen, an action packed film with great writing",9,1 July 2021,"Wrath of Man is directed by Guy Ritchie, from a script he co-wrote with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies. I won't lie, I'm not the biggest Guy Ritchie fan but there's a couple of his films that I love, Man of Wrath is one of them. His witty and clever dialogue, the writing and of course the way he shoots the movie. Everything is perfect and he nailed the pacing, and how the movie is separated into four parts, each chapter circling back to one main event that sets off a chain reaction, that was the right choice. The cinematography is incredible and a massive part of why this film works so well, I'll say the same thing about the editing.Jason Statham stars as H, a new cash truck driver in Los Angeles who thwarts a robbery only to have his mysterious past begin to get questioned. Holt McCallany, Jeffrey Donovan, Chris Reilly, Josh Hartnett, Laz Alonso, Raúl Castillo, DeObia Oparei, Eddie Marsan and Scott Eastwood also star. Man of Wrath have many well known actors and they never disappoint, even the ones with least screen time. The dialogue is executed perfectly which makes the witty lines funny, their performances are too great, Jason Statham brings one of his best.My rating is how I experienced Man of Wrath at the cinema, it's how a film with epic action set pieces and phenomenal sound design should be experienced, Chris Benstead's musical score was simply magnificent. It made the film much intriguing, suspenseful and just entertaining. So many parts that made the experience, top notch. Man of Wrath blew my expectations, and so did the man behind it, Guy Ritchie have made a film worth remembering.",Wrath of Man
58,bankofmarquis,Surprising Depth of Character along with Great Action,8,16 June 2021,"I am always up for a good ""B"" action flick - something mindless that shows a macho hero (usually seeking revenge) taking out a boatload of faceless/nameless bad guys. So it was with much anticipation that I settled back into my chair to clear my head and catch Jason Statham doing what he does best.What I got was something much, much more.Directed by Guy Ritchie (LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS), WRATH OF MAN tells the tale of seemingly innocent, meek, quiet man who takes a job with an Armored Car Company. Of course, since this meek man is played with a steely-eyed gaze by Jason Statham, there is something more to him. In the course of this film, of course, we find out.Ritchie is a seasoned veteran Director of these sorts of films (LOCK STOCK..., SNATCH and the recent THE GENTLEMEN being examples of his ability) and this film nicely showcases his skill. He sets up the characters and the action scenes deftly and he does something that I really love to see in a film - he shows the same action scene from 3 different character's' perspectives, every time we view the same scene from a different point of view it adds some depth to the scene (and the characters). It is this aspect of the film - the depth of character - that I was not expecting to see.Statham, of course, is perfectly cast as the mysterious ""H"". He has a strength of character (as well as a physical strength) needed to drive this story forward. I believed his motivations as a character while eagerly anticipating his ""turn on a dime"" change from ""meek and mild"" to ""action hero"". In lesser hands, it would have seemed corny, but with Statham (and the direction of Ritchie), it is not.Ritchie, of course, fills this world with a ""rogues gallery"" of tough guys, henchmen, unlikely heroes and villians. Standouts of this group were veteran character actor Holt McCallany (a veritable ""that guy"" actor) who plays a fellow armored car driver, Jeffrey Donovan (TV's BURN NOTICE) and Scott Eastwood (Clint's son) as a couple of ""bad guys"" and Darrell D'Silva (a veteran of European films who was heretofore unknown to me) as one of Statham's allies. Whenever D'Silva was on the screen, he would draw my attention (in a good way). I'll be keeping an eye out for him in future films.Also along for the fun are the great Eddie Marsan (as the Manager of the Armored Car Company) and a gravelly voiced Andy Garcia (as a shadowy person from Statham's past). They both know exactly what type of film they are in and look like they are having fun with their roles. Oh...and there is also a Josh Hartnett sighting (the ""it"" actor of the early '2000's). His character of another Armored Car Driver is the weakest written and least realized of the characters in this film - but it was fun to see him on screen again.But...all of these fine qualities rise or fall on the Direction of the action sequences and in the capable hands of Guy Ritchie, these scenes succeed greatly. He sets up and choreographs the fights (both hand-to-hand and gun fights) in such a way that the audience is never confused about what is going on (unless it is a deliberate choice) and he eschews the quick-cut editing that (I feel) is a sign of a weakly conceived and choreographed fight.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film - not only for the action, but for the depth of character and quality that was put up on the screen.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Wrath of Man

Who is the man and why all these happens is what Guy Ritchie (former Mr. Madonna) show as in almost two intense hours.As in the French version violence is heavy but is not an action film. There are a couple of spectacular shootings, but the focus is in more realistic and dramatic violence. Not that spectacular but very very shocking.Characters and reactions are quite realistic. As a recurrent theme in Ritchie's universe; there are not really good guys. Just innocent bystanders.Even Statham character is not the ""good guy"" you expect; neither the killers could not be considered totally bad people. There is social commentary here, not as strong as the French version; but more according to America's way.The main failure of the movie are some unexplained characters and scenes staged too grandiloquent for its own good.In brief; is a very good drama some violent shocking moments.",Wrath of Man
62,Sir_AmirSyarif,Mostly gets the job done,6,11 September 2021,"The narrative of Guy Ritchie's 'Wrath of Man' isn't too complex; rather, it's in the way it's conveyed when it tries to present itself in a non-linear manner. Sure, the non-linear method adds to the film's intrigue, but it also disrupts the flow and takes away most of the fun. It's a good picture that strives hard to be a serious action film, but it simply doesn't quite hit the mark.

64,kuarinofu,Mostly boring,5,27 May 2021,"If you love Ritchie films you tend to expect a level of quality from him, well, at least his basics all featured (except for King Arthur of course).This one is just boring, after an intriguing first 20 minutes the story stops completely, and by the time you get through a 30 min flashback, you may even forget where the story was standing at.Even the action scenes felt boring in this, mostly because those were just pointless, Statham never even needed to participate in the biggest of those (closer to the end). There was no way the robbers could've escaped since they only had two ATVs ready for them and the money, which were seriously shrunk down in size to fit in a Prius. And if he in fact made that plant, why would he even need to risk his life in the first place.It's not even about the plotholes, but as I've said, it was just boring, and the beginning scene is shown three times in the film, in case you really forgot.5 stars for the soundtrack, it was amazing.",Wrath of Man
65,Movi3DO,Statham is too cool,8,27 May 2021,"After The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie returns with another one, and this time it is with Jason Statham.This movie was quite awesome. The best part was Jason Statham, who embraced this role and became a badass and menacing man. Every time he was on the screen, he was cold, determined, and a man with few words.Throughout the movie, there was always the same dark and ominous background music that kept making me feel tense and on the edge. Also, the music made Jason Statham's character even more menacing.Problems would be that the pacing was a little bit slow at times. Also, there was not as much action as I anticipated. There were other characters introduced later that were straightforward and predictable. However, the non-linear storytelling was not the most unique, it was still intriguing and kept me interested in the movie. The story itself was revenge, as suggested from the title, and it was an entertaining one.Overall, although there were some issues, the good storytelling, music, and acting from Statham made for a cool main character and an entertaining time. 8.5/10.",Wrath of Man

68,msbreviews,"Wrath of Man isn't a groundbreaking, mind-blowing, or even innovative action movie, but it's still one of the biggest, best surprises of the year.",7,6 May 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Some people really don't appreciate Guy Ritchie's style. His trademark fast-forward, HFR (high frame rate) type of action doesn't appeal to many viewers, and his nonlinear narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating. At least, these are the common complaints across his filmography. While I acknowledge that these attributes don't always work, I'm actually quite a fan of his filmmaking techniques. From his more recent work on Aladdin and The Gentlemen to his take on classic characters such as Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, I genuinely enjoy Ritchie's risky, divisive approach on the best way to tell a story.Going in completely blind to Wrath of Man, I honestly didn't have a good feeling. I expected a generic, hollow, forgettable action flick with a main actor who everyone has seen countless times in this genre. I just hoped it would be entertaining enough for me to have a decent couple of hours in front of the TV. Well, this movie might be 2021's best surprise to date! If Zack Snyder (Zack Snyder's Justice League) is often criticized for his excessive use of slow-motion, Ritchie receives the exact same complaints but regarding his high-speed action scenes. This time, the latter leaves his well-known characteristics aside and proves that he's not a one-trick filmmaker.Impressively long, uncut takes - some reach the three-minute mark - help create a tremendously tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime. Every scene is set up with patience and precise timing, making every single tiny movement from the camera and actors capture the audience's attention. Christopher Benstead's score is one of those examples that I will start giving people when they ask about impactful music in film. The heavy cello notes are incredibly ominous, establishing the mood of the whole environment in a way that will leave no viewer indifferent. Some of you might read the following as a critique, but the build-ups for each action scene steal the spotlight from the latter.With that said, the shootouts and overall action are entertaining and well-filmed, which I believe will please a vast majority of spectators. Jason Statham (The Meg, Hobbs & Shaw) delivers a one-dimensional performance that would feel disappointing in any other movie, but it works for this protagonist. The main character is supposed to be mysterious and capable of anything, so it's only logical that he hides every ounce of emotion - even though it negatively affects a couple of dialogues. Furthermore, it's Jason Statham... moviegoers go see his films for his action skills, not his acting chops. When it comes to fire a gun or beat someone up, there are not that many actors who can do so as convincing as him.Story-wise, Ritchie didn't let go of his favorite narrative structure. Nonlinear storytelling is extremely difficult to pull off perfectly due to how easily it becomes confusing or messy. Fortunately, Wrath of Man features several storylines converging all in a single moment, which quickly demonstrates what the screenwriters plan to do. A mysteriously compelling first half transitions to a more predictable, formulaic second part where one of the storylines feels both tacked on and uninteresting. The secondary characters lack any sort of arc or random development, with the focus going completely into the protagonist's mission, whatever that may be.Wrath of Man isn't a groundbreaking, mind-blowing, or even innovative action movie, but it's still one of the biggest, best surprises of the year. While it's true that Guy Ritchie still follows the genre formulas of success, he shocks everyone by leaving his trademark filmmaking techniques aside, delivering an incredibly tense film packed with suspenseful, one-take build-ups to energetic, riveting action sequences. Jason Statham's one-dimensional display works well enough for a mysteriously captivating protagonist who the viewers can easily root for once his true goal is revealed. Christopher Benstead's score tremendously elevates the entire movie, establishing an extremely gripping atmosphere. The nonlinear storytelling features parallel narratives that are not all interesting or necessary, ending with an ironically abrupt last scene, contradicting the overall steady pacing. In the end, it's a solid recommendation to watch in theaters if possible.Rating: B+",Wrath of Man

I must admit, this guy knows whereof he speaks.Let me say this straight away; it's not your conventional/mainstream Action spectacle, nor it ever pretends to be. As it turns out, It just doesn't fall in line with other contemporary works in this space. In contrast, it does contravene a lot of modern-day trends by proffering eccentric avenues through an Old-school approach!In Layman's terms, 'Wrath of Man' establishes authority through sheer presentation skills & Guy Richie's customary stylization. Slow pans, one takes, bird's-eye view; the Guy Ritchie trademark is all over its Cinematography and Visual Representation. Barring the pictorial mastery which doesn't shy away from Blood & Gore, it has also benefited from a sumptuous Score that accommodates so well with the rest.Other than its tedious pacing and pronounced scarcities relating to character depictions; everything else has been carried out in a rather tidy fashion. And when Jason Statham is at the forefront; one could be assured of his total commitment and dedication; especially in the role of a thick-skinned Badass! Lately, his selections of scripts might have become a bit mundane and predictable yet I gotta confess; he's so good at what he does.Now if I'm being brutally honest, I had gone in with limited expectations this time; anticipating another one of those nonsensical, idiotic Action flicks.

The whole film is a 7/10 but the ending is a 3/10. ""Let the painter paint"" happens throughout the entire film, yet at the end of the film, the painter seemingly throws his paint-brush to the floor and gives up, instead of shoving said paint-brush through the canvas and then burning the canvas, as the canvas rightly deserves.... that's really my only issue with the movie, but apart from the end, the movie is good. 7/10, completely watchable, but nowhere near 'John Wick' levels.",Wrath of Man
73,MrDHWong,A decently entertaining return to the director's roots that should satisfy longtime fans of his work,7,1 July 2021,"""Wrath of Man"" is a heist thriller directed and co-written by Guy Ritchie (""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Snatch"") based on the 2004 French film ""Cash Truck"". Starring Jason Statham in the lead role, it is a decently entertaining return to the director's roots that should satisfy longtime fans of his work.In Los Angeles, the emotionless and enigmatic Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) applies for a job as a security truck driver at Fortico Security. Hill just barely meets the necessary requirements during his training but ends up hired by the company anyway and is given the nickname ""H"" by his supervising guard ""Bullet"" (Holt McCallany). A short time later, Bullet is taken hostage by a group of masked criminals but H arrives and expertly shoots them all in spite of his qualifications showing otherwise. While he is hailed as a hero by the rest of his co-workers, investigators become highly suspicious of H's past and learn there is more to him than meets the eye.From what I have seen, Guy Ritchie is a director whose films people either really enjoy or loathe entirely. They usually revolve around intricately planned heists, British gangsters wielding guns, and intersecting plot lines that build to an explosive finale. ""Wrath of Man"" is yet another example of this veteran filmmaker's craftsmanship and it just so happens to tick all of those boxes. With that said, the film doesn't offer anything new from what we've come to expect from the likes of Ritchie but it does manage to be just as fun. Being a heist film, our full attention is required to make sense of the entire plot, but here it is surprisingly easier to follow than in most of Ritchie's previous movies. There are no red herrings to confuse us nor are there too many distractions that take us out of the story. Instead, we have a relatively straightforward heist and revenge romp that wouldn't feel out of place had it been released back in the 90s.Rather than the gritty streets of London's criminal underbelly, Ritchie transports us to the urban jungle of Los Angeles, which, to be fair, shares some distinct similarities to the home ambiance he is used to. Gang violence is still a persistent problem, people are still killing each other over money, and corruption is still rife among the police force. What Ritchie is aiming to showcase here is how such things are universal with only the country of origin being the major distinguishing factor. In addition to this, I also liked the film's use of claustrophobic sets, with most of the action taking place inside cramped locations like the front seat of a security truck or small underground storage rooms. This made the ever-growing tension among the characters more believable as it was a good indicator of how stressful carrying out such a heist must be for them. Around this point in a Guy Ritchie movie, there would normally be some comic relief to soften the severity of scenes like this but I cannot recall a single time where I even smiled. Of course, it is not a requirement for a serious scene to include something funny but in Ritchie's past movies he found ways to work humour into them so it feels weird that they are absent here. Thankfully, there are some solid action scenes and clever payoffs during the film's final act that make up for this lack of comedy but it still would have been nice to have had something to laugh at throughout all of this.Predictably, Jason Statham dominates yet another role where he gets to play a stoic, tough-as-nails Englishman with violent tendencies. His character does exactly what you'd expect him to do - fight through a barrage of bad guys using a gun and occasionally his fists. The only difference here is that he is in America, where his English accent often stands out. I feel like at this point in Statham's career, it is futile to complain about the lack of diversity in the roles he picks so just sit back and enjoy seeing him play himself for the umpteenth time. As for the rest of the cast, I didn't really care about anyone else. I would have liked for some of the criminals to be given better backstory and motivations as to why they are carrying out their heist in the first place instead of them simply wanting more retirement money. It is clear that the film has been written around Statham's character, with little focus placed on the others so that essentially reduces the whole thing to being a one-man show for his gun-toting antics.Overall, while ""Wrath of Man"" isn't anything special, especially when compared to Guy Ritchie's better films like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", there's still enough to keep devoted fans and even the odd newcomer to his work happy. I still wish Ritchie, like Statham, would one day step out of his comfort zone and try more different things. The closest he has come to making something unlike his previous work was the 2019 live-action version of ""Aladdin"" but he only felt like a director-for-hire with that project. I suppose in the end it all comes down to that classic saying - ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".I rate it 6.5/10.",Wrath of Man

79,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,16 May 2021,"The stage curtains open ...It was good to see Jason Statham take on a more serious role again, away from the glitz and glamour of the ""Expendables"" and ""Fast & Furious"" movies. ""Wrath of Man"" is gritty, dark, brutal, and brooding. It is unforgiving at its core, yet satisfactory in its delivery. To me, it was almost like ""Reservoir Dogs"" meets ""Training Day"". I honestly feel that it is perhaps the best hard-hitting crime/action film to have come out since ""Training Day"". I think with repeated viewings, I could come to appreciate it as much, and it may someday become known as one of Statham's best, and a cult classic.Statham plays the part of ""H"", a newly hired guard for Fortico, an armored truck company. Barely passing the minimum requirement to get the job, it isn't long before he is put to the test when a truck he is guarding is hit. He pulls out his gun, and minutes later, all of the assailants are dead, leaving everyone to scratch and shake their heads. Who is ""H"" really? And why is he here? The owner is satisfied with a ""job well done"", but everyone else knows he must have a hidden agenda. The plot unfolds and the bodies pile up as Statham commands an undeniable kickass presence on the silver screen.I actually wasn't planning on watching this one tonight, but I'm glad I did. It is a very well made film with an excellent plot, solid acting, memorable action sequences, and tight direction and editing. Yes, it is an extremely violent film, they did not hold back. Brutal and bloody - but with a purpose. This isn't your over-the-top special effects extravaganza. It is very dark and very much in your face with gut wrenching scenes. Even so, I couldn't turn my eyes away.When it was all said and done, I enjoyed this one. I think it catches Statham (now 53 years old) in fine form, completely believable, and mesmerizing in his role. I would recommend this movie for the fan of a good crime film.

Director Guy Ritchie brings us a dark, action thriller about a cold and mysterious character who works at a cash truck company responsible for moving hundreds of millions of dollars around Los Angeles each week. It's not the typical Guy Ritchie movie but is an English language remake or reimagining of the 2004 French film Convoyeur (""Cash Truck""). Need a dose of blood-soaked testosterone? Here you go.THINGS I LIKED:
I always get a kick out of anti-hero Jason Statham. He plays his usual character but always does a good job. One of his older movies that shows a softer side of his typical gritty characters is one I saw recently called ""Redemption"" / Redeemed
I also always enjoy seeing Scott Eastwood in movies. His dad, the famous Clint Eastwood, has to be a proud papa.I've been a fan of Jeffrey Donovan ever since I first saw him in Burn Notice: The Complete Series. My husband and I binge-watched that fun series a couple of times!I haven't seen Josh Hartnett in quite a while, so I enjoyed seeing him again.The music by Christopher Benstead is SUPER intense.This is the first movie poster that features the new print logo for MGM. MGM rebranded its image in March 2021 without the famous Leo the Lion.If you're a fan of Circles singer Post Malone, you get to see him in the flick getting gunned down by Jason Statham. Most actors would be sad to have such short-lived screen time, but Post admitted he was super psyched about it.My husband actually knew a guy who tried to rob a money truck like this one many years ago. He ended up in jail. No big surprise there.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The opening credits show artistic images from the Bible. With a title like Wrath of Man, I thought there would be more biblical tie-ins, especially after seeing those images in the beginning. The story never really tied all of that together clearly.There are some good camera shots, but it's not nearly as good as the usual stylish Guy Ritchie movie. The characters in his movies are often quirky and entertaining, with a story that hast twists and humor. We don't really experience any of that in this film.The plot of a violent revenge story with a heist thrown in is something we've seen many times before so the end of this film is super predictable.The timeline jumps around a LOT, which could be confusing for some viewers.The movie takes itself very seriously.Some of the dialogue is exhausting and dumb. What's worse is that it makes good actors sound bad.We see the same scene over and over again, each time with more information, but it loses impact after multiple viewings.Act 3 consists of lots of mind-numbing shooting and shooting and shooting.What's up with Andy Garcia only showing up as brief cameos in movies lately?Ultimately, this movie is easily forgettable.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of F-bombs and other profanity
Lots of different kinds of weapons and firearms
Lost of violence and killing with a high body count
You see the naked backside of some people.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Wrath of Man
81,latinfineart,A decent film.,6,3 June 2021,Nothing particularly great. Just two hours of grim entertainment. Stratham was excellent. Direction? OK. Ritchie is losing his ability to create entertainment.,Wrath of Man
82,danielcereto,Guy Ritchie's movies,7,27 May 2021,"I love Guy Ritchie's movies, and Wrath of a Man has all the ingredients to be a good action movie.First, the cast is amazing. Amazing to watch Jason Statham, Josh Hartnett, Holt McCallany and Raul Castillo in the same movie. Great genre actors.Second, even the script could have been better is good enough to entertain you with some twists on the story timeline.Last, cinematography and music are excellent as in all Guy Ritchie's movies. This time Los Angeles scenarios are great.So, overall a pretty good action film, far from movies like Heat but better than 90% of actual films. Enjoy.",Wrath of Man
83,Xavier_Stone,Simply too predictable,4,26 May 2021,"From the opening 5 minutes and shortly thereafter you can predict this entire movie. But of course there are countless flash backs to help out just in case you're missing a few parts.Not much fighting in this one, mostly gun play and a typical revenge flick. Slow and tedious at times but otherwise watchable. Could have been loads better with just a bit more effort in the script and plot, and that is what makes this barely average.",Wrath of Man
84,roxmewild,Nothing good or new here!,1,2 June 2021,Yet another Guy Ritchie meaningless film!Zero depth to characters Zero story Plenty of violence Plenty of the same old cliches in script Ritchie has been producing the same old same old that you can smell a Richie movie within the first 10 mins of watching!I managed to watch an hour of it but boredom prevented me from watching to its predictable end.,Wrath of Man

Excellent opening scene with the POV type camera angle! Kinda weird not seeing the driver! Also weird how much Scott Eastwood looks like his dad with that beard! Great, creepy use of Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues""! A good action, heist, revenge film! I could definitely watch it again!""Liver. Lungs. Spleen. Heart.""",Wrath of Man
87,nikola17,when movie ended I felt like I wanted to watch it again,10,10 May 2021,"I didn't just love movie because of Statham or action I thought Statham character, story, the back and fourth style like scenes go present and scenes goes back to past to explain what happened in story before this happened and that happens if you get what I am saying, it's very smart writing, very intense grim heist revenge film Statham character was a cold Blood scary guy he is not really of bad guy kinda but not in psycho or bad way but Cold Blood guy when something goes wrong like he doesn't take any crap from anyone his character has a mystery background type so that's why you know he is Cold Blooded person like you say to yourself dam not the guy you want to mess around withStatham character he is cold blooded mysterious guy witch you know when you see film. Jason Statham is perfectly fitting for the role of mysterious H., a character with dark past a very Cold Blooded person and blurred present. Again, it's not just Statham action film performance like with any of another films, since here action mixed with dark thriller for the most part prevails, like with Den of Thieves type not just action I wouldn't mind if it's full on action film, but it mixed with thriller but in perfect way when you watch movie it makes you sit their knowing you want to know what is gonna happen next you don't feel bored, you don't get bored while watching this movie, once youwatch it, film will hold you to start to middle to end. Think of shortened edition of Michel Mann's 'Heat' rather than just black comedy Snatch or Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, and you'll got some understanding of what it's all about this film had little lines to laugh at but it's not black comedy type not overtop comedy movie Starts like action-comedy, but then getting more and more dark, as new elements of the story introduced, it leaves you cold note to side that tells you this movie film never messes you around no joke, this movie is far better more cold blooded then to dragged across concrete no joke. This film is a remake from a French film cask truck aka Le Convoyeur (2004) this film was gonna be called Cash Truck but then changed with a great better title then stealing it from original French movie Wrath of man better title so people don't know this is a remake from French movie until you searched this movie. Some reviews say the story is predictable but I disagree don't ever pay attention to reviews they are just taking full of crap they don't know what theywant from films nowadays if you listen to them your been fooled by idiots who can not rate their movies nowadays saying this is awful this is eh film just trust yourself your instincts just watch film even without listen to critics they just love to fool you around. Story follows The plot follows H (Jason Statham) a cold blooded and mysterious character working at a cash truck company responsible for moving hundreds of millions of dollars around Los Angeles each week. H surprises his co-workers in his first day of his job when he unleashes precision skills during a heist against other thugs The crew is left wondering who he is and where he came from. Soon, the marksman's ultimate motive becomes clear as he takes dramatic and irrevocable steps to settle a score.But it's not just a heist film it's also holds a revenge story witch it just doesn't hold heist film but it holds with revenge in it as well. The The plot has multiple twists and the characters too develop. And cast besides Statham cast was just perfect like (Josh Hartnett) as Boy Sweat Dave known for Black Hawk Down, Wrong Man aka lucky number 7 and many more film he is in I thought he left Hollywood didn't want to anything with Hollywood but now he cameback in few movies including this film as well he did fine in movie but yet again he is not much in it, also you have (Holt McCallany) as bullet in film he been in a lot of movies like Gangster Squad, Bullet to the Head, Losers, Jack Reacher never look back, Mindhunter series. His character did fine he play's as H Partner even he introduce him in movie but no chemistry together it made me wish it Josh and Holt role would been switched to Josh role let Holt have Josh role that's what I prefer but I would rather see Statham and Josh together then havingHolt McCallany as Partner I don't know that's just me. You have so many other familiar actors soo many faces like Jeffrey Donovan known for Burn Notice, Scott Eastwood aka Clint Eastwood son, witch Scott Eastwood played with Statham in Fate of Furious AKA Fast and Furious 8. Eddie Marsan known in many movies he has been in like Ray Donovan, Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2 many other staff his been in, Andy García I am like dam cast is packed and didn't see it coming I thought cast did well even they weren't part of movie very good cast choice just I wish I wanted to see someone play's Raúl Castillo witch he is terrible actor. Rest of story witch I will never explain because if I do it will spoil review watch film it's so worth of it for your time, worth of paying to see to see a fun action drama, thriller heist-revenge flick it's totally worth seeing Kept me on the edge of my seat.I was very surprised guy Ritchie was back into directing films with Statham in this level I reckon this is the best one he did look I liked and enjoyed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Revolver but then rest of films didn't care for Sherlock Holmes 1&2, didn't care for Man of Uncle, King Arthur Legend of
Sword crap witch I thought it was worst movie I have ever in theater most boring film ever then I said to myself where has Guy Ritchie gone into what kinda movies he is making today??? Then what makes him think to make remake Disney crap Aladdin I am like jeez then never ever cared about Gentlemen. Year later he did this I am like far out this is much better, better guy Ritchie film working with Statham :) putting smile in my face him and guy Ritchie is back in this better film. I reckon Guy Ritchie smashed directing this movie did a phenomenal job and Jason Statham does not disappoint with his tough guy personality as character. Let me tell you something you can nevergo wrong with Statham never go wrong his movies are great, fun to watch a lot of times he play's different characters like in this movie I reckon he should do action movies and sometimes roles like this Cold Blooded character like in Mechanic or 13 movie he has done he kinda played bad guy those films but in this one is different. If you go wrong with Statham then your idiot what else can I say 10 out 10 flick go and see it or else your gonna regret it for listening to negative critics what they say about movie don't watch trailer, don't even read negative reviewers just watch film as blind date, blind folded.",Wrath of Man
88,gab-67599,Statham Is The Man,10,3 June 2021,"Anytime I can see Statham and Donovan in a movie it is a great day. I am kind of picky when it comes to stories though and while I would see this movie again. I was left with a few questions. Like, how could Statham not find out who was behind the heist when he was the one who said the truck went the ""Latter"". I assume he was working with the bank robbers since he was basically the look out guy, right?I also thought Ferns the friend of Statham was the boss at first. Turns out Statham was the boss, boss of what though? I am not quite sure of. I enjoy a simple but not predictable story. Although I really enjoyed this movie I was left with questions. Do I recommend this movie, hell yes! The action and acting were on point.Also after seeing American heist for the first time today, anything was better than seeing Brody trying to act like some sort of gangster. This movie kept me on the edge holding my breath, waiting to see what would happen next. A bit slow, and with the redundant theme music in the background. Both of which I could have done without. Still a must see and well worth the price of admission.",Wrath of Man

I'll be honest I didnt have much faith in this movie being any different to Stathams other projects but I was pleasantly surprised as this is a must watch. Jason Statham is an actor I've had the honour of enjoying but to an extent, alot of his roles are the same but this one is different, proper character development.I really enjoy this movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole duration of watching. Enough scenes to build you up to get so hyped, the hype for this movie was expected after seeing the trailer. Perfect movie with an incredible story like no other, I dont believe I've seen a movie quite like this one, definately one to watch!What i loved most about this film, besides the insane action and story development was that I enjoyed the fact they showed us the story from two points of view, both scenarios linking up and making the plot make so much more sense was incredible.Highly recommend!",Wrath of Man

92,Magow-Intermean,Wrath of Man Review,7,30 May 2021,"Sticking to the lower budget roots that got him a start in a big way thanks to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, Guy Ritchie has followed up his minor but well-received The Gentleman with Wrath of Man, a crime thriller that sees the divisive but entertaining director get his favorite lad Jason Statham back on leading man duties.The last time these two long term friends teamed up was for the near forgotten about Revolver, a film that is actually a lot better than you may remember it being, and Wrath of Man is far more straight forward than that affair, with Ritchie remaking European film Cash Truck to deliver a hard-boiled and gritty 90's like action/thriller that gives Statham some of his best material in years.It may surprise many that this reforming of Ritchie and Statham see's the usually flamboyant director dial things back a notch or two with his hyperkinetic visuals and edits few and far between here and his cockney tinged humor reigned right in as we instead get a mostly humorous free affair following Statham's mysterious H in a new job for a cash truck company that has recently been hit by a deadly heist and seems destined to be targeted once more by a group of elite robbers looking to make a quick buck.With some bleak but atmospheric cinematography from Alan Stewart, some moody and effective scoring from composer Christopher Benstead and some grizzled performances from co-stars Holt McCallany, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and for what feels like the first appearance in eons from Josh Hartnett, Wrath of Man is a solid all round package that benefits from Ritchie's experience hands as he delivers a non-linear examination of what lead H down this new employment path and who exactly is behind a string of well-oiled robberies taking place across Los Angeles.There's certainly nothing new or unique about Wrath of Man's central plot or the moments that litter its runtime, in many ways this the definition of a vengeance/crime thriller rulebook in action but there's a sheen and professionalism on display throughout the film and with Statham having an absolute blast (figuratively and at times literally) being back with one of his longest serving collaborators and with some genuinely great set-pieces that ramp up to a pulse-pounding finale, Wrath of Man may not be top-shelf Ritchie, but its top-class crime thriller fare that will please all genre diehards.",Wrath of Man

But all this was, was an indirect story based around Clint Eastwood Jr., starring Jason Stratham and a few other decent actors with cameo appearances of Andy Garcia.

The story is run of the mill, money transport company job that's been done so many times and a hell of a lot better. Statham's 1st big flop for me as he seems to be absent in most of his very few screen shots (looks like he's in a fog just going through the motions). I don't know why Guy Ritchie bothered making this snooze reel. It's very predictable, nothing different or exciting...It was truly a boring movie. My idols crumbled on the screen. BAD Movie.",Wrath of Man

Was good to know that I wasn't spoiled in any capacity, and it's barely a part of the movie.In summary, it's a ""slow cooking meal"" that has good action (nothing over the top) and execution. The story is a tad simplistic and not bogged down by anything else than what you would expect, but does a good job to entertain and pass the time. I'd say it's more of a thriller than it is action, though. Nothing particularly memorable, lacking in dialogue, but didn't leave a bad after taste. The tone is consistent throughout, but you probably won't get satisfaction when it's done.I wanted more, I guess. The definition of a fine story.",Wrath of Man
97,DeBBss,Something Different,7,27 June 2021,"Wrath of Man is a movie about revenge, but with a twist. What makes Wrath of Man so different is how the way the protagonist gets his revenge. Jason Statham's character, H, doesn't chase the bad guys, instead he waits for them to come to him. It's a unique twist on the genre that also adds a different type of tension.The acting was pretty decent, too. Jason Statham did a solid enough job at being a psychopathic mobster out for revenge. The cast was also well-put together. And when it comes to the characters, they're all pretty standard. No one is particularly interesting except for H. There's just a lot of one-dimensional characters.The film was also very well shot. The cinematography and editing were very clean, so at least it's visually pleasing. The action for the most part was short and intense, but the last fight scene was a little generic. It lost all its realism and it quickly became like any other action movie. It wasn't necessarily bad, but I think it could've been done better.In the end, Wrath of Man is a pretty solid revenge flick. It's a change of pace from the usual Jason Statham movies. It's a 7/10 from me: the acting, cinematography, editing, pacing, and action was for the most part great.",Wrath of Man

99,gavinp9,Assured revenge fun in classic Statham style,8,19 May 2021,"'Wrath of Man' is the first Guy Ritchie/Jason Statham film in a few years and it's good to see them both back doing what they do best! This time, the location is Los Angeles, but still the gritty wrong-side-of-the-tracks, as we follow Hill (Statham) as he joins a security firm for a cash transport company, where he's shown the ropes by Bullet (McCallany) and Dave (Hartnett). The first act plays like a straightforward heist film.But then we have a flashback for the 2nd act (I like the title cards between them) to give us more backstory and then the 3rd act flips everything into a revenge film as we find out what's motivating Hill and how Jackson (Donovan), Tom (Reilly) and Jan (Eastwood) fit in. The pieces all fit together quite well, but still leave one big question heading into the 4th & final act.Needless to say, the body count is quite high (30+), Statham does his strong/silent type well, with a few well-placed quips, there's enough insight into the supporting cast and a crazy shoot-out finale. The score was sometimes overbearing, but the pacing was good. Probably better than 'The Gentlemen' in my book.",Wrath of Man

I diddn't even watch any trailers on this because I diddn't want to know what to expect. Upon conclusion of the film I was left dissapointed.First the movie is bit to long they could of shaved off 20-25 minutes and nothing would of changed at all. Second the acting from all parties wasn't great by any means Statham included. Lastly I felt direction the movie took was odd and that the movie could been alot better if it was formulated differently.With all that said the visuals weren't bad, there was good amount of action, and the ending was very satisfying.

Everybody else's character's turn into the opposite that they started with.So instead of getting solid characters with a good story, you get a watered down story, and the characters are twisted up, acting tough.

106,EvanKevelson,"After ""The Gentleman"" needed to rewatch (6.5)",6,21 July 2021,"ANY QUESTION WHETHER STATHAM WOULD BE A GOOD ""DARK"" BOND...after this roll and others ABSOLUTELY!Guy Ritchie return of Statham...but this was simply a more complex version Stanley Kubriks ""the Killing"".After numerous viewings there is sharp banter that doesn't translate through the brooding musical score, and it's either the actors or it's not funny with an American presentation. In previous Ritchie films I know that many of the wise cracks in this feature are lost because of both. E.g. The crack that Statham makes about having small hands, and the banter surrounding it in the locker room is lost. At the onset of the whining veteran get together...describing his day with the watching of TV was meant to be funny but simply didn't translate as funny.Then you have what appears to be very awkward dialogue.The ""Gentleman"" had its dark moments but the cast was able to maintain the balance. Such as Fletcher's first description of the Dry-Eye and Mickey Pierson meeting. The actual meeting between Mickey and Lord George. The conversation between Dry Eye and Mrs. Pierson regarding what she'd do with the gun/paper weight.I don't think the dialogue was missing in this film, but cultural delivery doesn't translate, and overall outside Statham's crew, the casting chemistry just came off as forced.Every Ritchie film faves of mine or even ones that didn't meet my expectations I do typically appreciate the dialogue, it's British Tarantino to me, I don't know where that went in this film. (I even wondered if the ex marines with restless whining sociopath syndrome- if their exchanges in cockney would have made the final machine comically over the top) The banter amongst the guards at Statham's onset as well may have gone over better in a UK culture. The dialogue is a constant in nearly every Guy Ritchie film though not so much so in "" Revolver"" totally absent in this movie which was dark and philosophical.The movie is a classic heist/revenge combo type of movie. Before the flashback that lead to the beginning of movie It was clear to me that Statham was not a cop but definitely a force to be reckoned with seeking those with the MO of the opening of the film. Now I wasn't aware he was shot, and that his son was killed until the scene. After seeing them walk away when ""Boss"" was on the inside, it may have been vengeance for moving in on that crew's territory.I did like the casting of Statham's crew and the interaction amongst them, I was upset that they were kept in the dark with Statham's infiltration on the inside of the cash truck company.After Statham earns hero status it became quite obvious that Bullet was the inside man and not ""Boy Sweet Dave"", who was having a mental breakdown.So I don't learn much about the ""Evil out of line"" crew until the flashback sequence At that juncture it's not shocking or suspenseful information, a group of close veterans resentful for the lack of fiscal reimbursement or their inability to readapt to a regular working man lifestyle...The unfortunate coincidence of one marine being a psychotic, and the shooting of Statham and his son was the only revelation.The story wasn't bad but definitely not unique.Unfortunately you're 70/30% that it was all an inside job (The shooters as well) until you see Statham's child get shot by a clearly unstable member that hypothetically would have been discharged or killed by making them all part of a possible murder 1 .The movie had a dark tone but just contemplating that kind of Big Heist was truly moronic. The best case scenario you'd need a lot more than one inside man, and in addition Bullet would not hypothetically be able to attain all the necessary variables.I even still had hope that when Bullet informs Statham, that before they hooked up with the begrudged veterans that a twist would turn around into Statham and his gang doing an ambush. However the routine follow through had to take place because Statham's crew was not involved.Simply put I felt the story was quite ordinary, and Statham though underutilized in terms of wit and charm did show he can do a truly evil character beyond the ant-hero. The FBI letting him clean up 90% of their caseload was not realistic either. The sound track kept the mood incredibly intense, and until the very end the violence lacked the absurdity of John Wick but ended with it.Not what I expected and I had similar experience with Shutter Island as well as the Hateful 8.",Wrath of Man

It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that matches the soundtrack so well to what's happening on screen.Without spoiling any elements of the story, obviously deaths occur in this Revenge Thriller. In fact. Lots of deaths occur, and by writing nothing but scumbag characters, it completely legitimizes the violence. I love that kind of attention to detail in scripts. I don't want to see a movie where low-level bad guys are executed without a second thought.In terms of movie elements, there are no major plot holes, the suspense is good throughout, and the characters are written well. The soundtrack is great from start to finish. The movie also replays certain elements (specific scenes) multiple times, but always from a different perspective, so it never seems to waste screen time, like some other movies. The mystery of who might be helping from the inside is very predictable, but the ride to the end is still very enjoyable.Are there silly unbelievable movie elements (like armored truck drivers acting like cops, magic bullets, magic armor, Mike Myers-style unkillable good and bad guys, etc...?) Sure. But that was completely fine for me. I knew I was watching a fun movie, and not the news.I loved this beginning to end, and again I have to express how much the soundtrack was amazing.

An Armored truck in transit in Los Angeles is held up during A heist and two guards are killed in the process. Five months later we're following Patrick Hill(Jason Statham) Who works as a Armor guard and meets a guy named Bullet(holt McCallany) who's decides to nickname Him H. They're Ambushed by some robbers and bullet taken hostage on H's first day, the tables are turned when H relentlessly slaughters all of them. The others suspect that he's not your average guy. Unlike the gentleman which played more on the fun comedic side. This takes a more dark and serious tone. Jason Statham is Jason Statham he doesn't try to be unique he knows he's awesome and still gives a good performance. Exactly who is H that's only half the story. Why exactly is here and want he's looking for is the drive of the movie. The actions not extremely violent or over the top. Which not necessarily a bad thing, Everybody has their preference, but I've never been one for the God Action star where they go through a gauntlet of enemies and don't get a Single scar.

Especially kind of closer to the end with those he's searching for It honestly starts to remind you of GTA five. Jasons the reason to watch the film and is the highlight ,However really outside of him none of the other guards really matter all that much. Christopher Benstead who did the music in the gentleman also does it here. Musics pretty decent with this deep Erie bass that play throughout the movie. Well not as funny as the gentleman.

The cast is interesting, and the characters are fun and the film doesn't tire the viewer with irrelevant things for the film and is therefore already better than most of today's films.Jason Statham is a kind of anti-hero here and it works great in the film. A solid action film with superbly directed action scenes. I would only like directors to use practical effects a little more instead of CGI, because they just look better and more convincing.The cinematography is good and the film is excellently directed. The action scenes are dynamic and tense, the film works great both as an action film and as a crime story.The film has a slightly darker atmosphere than we are used to in Guy Ritchie films, but that's not a bad thing at all and goes with the story. The cast is good, and Scott Eastwood is particularly interesting as Jan.Wrath of Man is a real refreshment and reminds us of the good old fashioned entertainment.",Wrath of Man

114,zac-04879,Slowly Intense and Solid Crime-Thriller; Enough Action,6,6 September 2021,"Guy Ritchie's exciting action sequences slowly become incapable to save the increasingly-sluggish pace. This usually happens over the draggy runtime of almost 2 full hours. Thankfully, this action-stocked crime-thriller will entertain or at least distract the viewer due to Jason Statham's great acting and a very fine plot.The lack of comical aspect and enthusiasm, in addition to the often dull rapidity and poor character development is what could've significantly been improved for Wrath of Man to be fully ideal. Everybody wants a fast, moving and gripping story, accompanied by strong personalities. Wrath of Man certainly could've and should've joined that feedback with what they originally included, with the same runtime. Unfortunately, it fails to do so, and true Guy Ritchie fans won't appreciate absence of good humour.Although the story and the heist isn't worth a cinema-viewing, it's solidly worthwhile. The hype is also a little too far, but Wrath of Man is only a likeable and acceptable flick due to the amazing plot. It's well-designed and frequently manages to entertain.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Wrath of Man
115,darkreignn,I really loved this film,9,9 May 2021,"""Wrath of Man"" is Guy Ritchie's answer to coronavirus fatigue - I don't know about you, but covid has really made me feel stagnated; every day feels the same, every emotion is one of boredom. Sure, I work, and I drink (oh boy, do I drink), but besides that, what else is there to do nowadays, besides watch movies? And unfortunately, it seems most of the movies releasing recently, whether in theatres or on HBO Max, have been, at least to me, pretty disappointing. So imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch ""Wrath of Man"" and, immediately, I realized it would be a high quality film.From the booming, dread-inducing soundtrack to the pure competence behind and in front of the camera, ""Wrath of Man"" is a Guy Ritchie film unlike any you have seen before. Gone is the rapid fire editing and crisp, witty dialogue - instead what we have is a more procedural, thorough film that really lets itself take its time in setting up its characters and the world they inhabit, introducing a mystery that slowly unravels as Guy Ritchie methodically pulls the thread. Yes, this is a darker, more solemn film for Guy, but it is undeniably still his movie - from the way the story is told, to the order of the narrative, to the high-octane, kinetic action, ""Wrath of Man"" still manages to scream Ritchie while still allowing Guy to explore a more menacing, even evil, tone. And I'll be damned if it didn't work out remarkably.""Wrath of Man"" starts off with a bang, literally, and never lets up. Even when the film slows down, the tension continues to build like a ticking time bomb. The film follows Jason Statham's character, named H, as he starts a new job as an armored cash truck driver. You don't know much, or really, anything, about H, and you certainly don't know why he decided to apply for this job of all places, especially when his company seems to be a hot target for the city's most vicious criminals. Encountering robbers who attempt to steal the thousands, sometimes millions, of dollars in the trucks seems to be a regular occurrence for these armored truck workers, and H seems happy to willingly throw himself into the deep end. H is a man of few words, but luckily, the movie has him speak through his actions, and his actions are badass.The story is intriguing enough, but Jason Statham takes everything to a whole new level because of how cool he is. And sure, he may be my man crush, but he was just so damn cool in this film. As I mentioned, he isn't the most verbal man in the world, but throughout every scene you can tell that he's planning something, but you won't know exactly what. He'll linger a little too long on a wall that contains the nametags of his coworkers, seemingly examining them for some unknown purpose; he'll jump out of the armored truck in the middle of a robbery, stare at the criminals, and you can tell that he just struck fear into their hearts simply through the look in his eyes. He gets plenty of time to shine on screen, and he steals the show completely. Which makes it all the more surprising that, when he isn't on screen, the movie is still relentlessly entertaining.Yes, while Jason Statham is the star, there are still many other characters and plot threads occurring here, and all of them are satisfying; every plot thread here comes together picture-perfectly - every arc is completed to perfection. ""Wrath of Man"" has a lot going on in it, and it's a testament to Guy Ritchie's skill that he can still manage to entertain his audience even when his leading man isn't on the screen.""Wrath of Man"" is one of the best, most intense thrillers I've seen this year. I'm telling you, if you enjoy: action movies, Jason Statham, Guy Ritchie, or good movies in general, you have to see this. The coronavirus may be infecting us all with boredom, but Guy Ritchie just delivered the cure with a straight up adrenaline injection in the form of ""Wrath of Man.""",Wrath of Man

117,jamesjustice-92,Ritchie and Statham at their grimmest,6,27 June 2021,"Jason Statham is a 21st century action hero with all kinds of action flicks behind his belt and here he reunites with the Guy that made him famous for the first time in 15 years. The movie blasts like a cannonball with its roaring cellos as a score and it gets tiring to hear the same melodies over and over again after some point but it delivers fine on the action with some of Ritchie's trademark non-linear plot which is sadly as old as the world itself.I honestly have no idea why a person of such calibre would make a superficial movie like this one, where the whole plot can easily fit into one sentence. The same old unstoppable killing machine wearing Statham's characteristic iron face who gets into business out of revenge - here, I did it. Just spared you two hours of your time, don't thank me.But seriously, this movie has some fun moments, I liked its grimness and shootout scenes and I was so glad to see the long forgotten Josh Hartnett who probably was the best of the cast. Jason was just being Jason so no real job done there and Scott Eastwood as just another villainy villain was just meh (I really couldn't say more about his performance).Overall if this movie was made in the 1980s (and it was my favorite time for action movies) I still wouldn't be impressed because as a Guy Ritchie movie it's way way too simple, as a Jason Statham movie it pales in comparison to his earlier work slightly and as an action piece it's just too darn long and tries too hard to be more than meets the eye, and fails.",Wrath of Man
118,itsbobr,Statham Rules,9,24 July 2021,"Jason Statham is Patrick Hill known as ""H"" a name given to him by Bullet (Holt McCallany) who trains H for an armored car security job. Takes a while when we learn that Patrick Hill is a low level Crime Boss who works under the big Crime boss Called Agent King (Andy Garcia). So why does Patrick Hill take a job as security guard when he has his own crime operation?This movie will go back and forth in time. (Don't you just hate that?) Once done you have all the answers, but I gave you a heads-up, sort of. Later, you will learn the real reason H goes to work for that armored company, Fortico.We will not learn any of H's crimes away from Fortico as that Is not what this story is about.H's boss, Agent King, knows H is a valuable Lieutenant and will let him do what needs to be done, and says, ""Let the Painter paint.""We will see heists and many gun shootouts. This time Statham as H will use guns in place of the close hand to hand fighting, we are used to Statham using.The movie moves along as a good pace and when H does his thing in foiling a robbery in the beginning, all Fortico employees wonder just who this person is.There is a point in the story when a Fortico armored truck is about to be robbed and H comes out of the truck and just stands there. The would- be robbers see him and turn and run away. Was that because the robbers knew him as a local Crime Boss and wanted nothing to do with him? That is the only explanation I could see or did they know of his skills with Fortico? Hmmmm...
...............
But the other real plot is that a group of ex-soldiers led by Jackson also known as Sarge (Jeffrey Donovan) has a plan to rob all of Forticos runs during Black Friday and that would total $150-Million. And, you guessed it, this will entail a lot of gun play.Notables: Scott Eastwood (Cliff's son) as Jan, a sort of hot head working for Jackson the Sarge; Chris Reilly as Tom Jackson's right hand man; Eddie Marson as Terry, Fortico's office manager; Niamh Alger as Dana, who works for Fortico and has a brief rumble in the hay with H, who makes sure she only tells him the truth as he is searching for something.Once you get past the going back in time and going forward in time and now know what H is about, you will enjoy the rest of the movie.

When I saw the trailer for it, I heard directed by Guy Ritchie, starring Statham, revenge, I was like, I'm in, unfortunately I also heard 'death of my son', which ruins the first twist of the movie, because the whole first act is Statham's character 'H' and his first day on the job at the armored truck facility and setting up a situation that we as the audience already know why. That is all I heard from the trailer; I am sure it gives more away. I won't though, going off that, we know H infiltrates the company to figure out who committed a robbery on one of the trucks that resulted in the death of an innocent by-stander... H's son! And as he investigates, man the plot just thickens! Think of the older Guy Ritchie movies, mixed with a bit of Ocean's Eleven, take away the humor, now throw in a dash of Fast and Furious. Why did I find it weird, mainly the first act and H's first day on the job, his new co-workers are over the top openly hostile towards him, and there's so much 12 year old boy locker room humor, and macho man stuff happening it was strange, and the fact that the workers seem to treat this job like they're going into war, and they might not see each other at 5pm clock out time, maybe they were shooting some metaphors at us, nahhhhh.

The British action star's first film since Hobbs & Shaw (2019), Wrath of Man sees him return to his roots, to the able hands of the director who launched him, Guy Ritchie, way back in 1998, in the classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.Statham has the star quality and the martial skills to make even wafer-thin plotlines successful with jaw-dropping stunt sequences, but give him a director of Guy Ritchie's calibre and the magic they generate becomes palpable!Explained in classic disjointed patterns as per usual from Ritchie, the film follows the story of a mysterious Londoner who takes up a gig as a cash truck security officer in Los Angeles. Only later do his colleagues notice his exceptional abilities with guns and close-quarter combat.The mysteries they uncover as they discover more about his sinister past forms the rest of the story. The plotline isn't particularly new or ingenuitive.But the director ably uses Statham's stoic gravitas to generate impact in an unabashed and unapologetically violent manner.If you are someone who skips through action sequences and violent shootouts, this film isn't for you. For Statham fans, it's a cant miss.Not as intelligent as Ritchie's Sherlock movies but nevertheless, a fun thrill ride. Recommended.",Wrath of Man
126,TuesdayThe17th,Guy Ritchie gives Statham the vehicle he deserves in a film that will reach a new circuit of viewers,7,14 July 2021,"Guy Ritchie pumps out another bad boy film for his ever growing portfolio of mobster like movies, this one being one of the more unique ones in the sense that this movie takes place in the U. S. and it will appeal to a wider audience. I am an avid horror and genre film follower who never follows the crowds. Jason Statham is such a trendy action hero, but i see more in him than just that. In my opinion, Statham is diverse and a really good actor. I am jist waiting to see him in a gritty horror film where he will finally be in every circuit of film. He is one of the better actors working today regardless of the so called stigma that he's strictly an action guy. He is better than Keanu Reeves in John Wick as his on screen fighting techniques are flawless and natural looking. The silent but deadly thing works very well for him and if anything, John Wick tries to copy this method.Lots of this movie is typical of Guy Ritchie. The overlapping time lines and constant flashbacks to build a coherent story. The colorful locations and set pieces that are used in every scene. And even though its toned down, the dialogue is great. This movie is one to watch but its also not very memorable as there is nothing ultra bandy on display here. I can see why others would find this movie boring or lacking thrill but still i found this movie to be very good as I lile these types of slow building and character driven films where not much happens through out. Ritchie works with a great cast including Post Malone is a cameo appearance as a gangster who's presence is short lived. Gritty yet restrained, seek this one out on blu ray. Though not very memorable, I can tell it has a good rewatch value. Watch it now, watch it again in 2 years.Good job Ritchie and Statham.",Wrath of Man
127,PCC0921,"You still have to have likeable characters, even the bad guys.",6,17 May 2021,"Released: May 7th, 2021
Viewed: May 13th, 2021Before I saw this film, the only exposure I had of Jason Statham was the Meg (2018) and the Expendables (2010-2014), films. Along with that, I thoroughly enjoyed the two Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes (2009 & 2011), movies and I totally respect Ritchie's style seen in some of his classics, like Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (1998). Hey, that's a Jason Statham movie too! I saw that one too! In the case of Wrath of Man (2021), it too had a lot of that style in it as well, to a point.This film is a remake of a French film called Le Convoyeur (Cash Truck - 2004). Basically, this is a revenge film revolving around the world of armored car heists. The plot of the film takes a ""Great Escape"" approach to its storytelling, albeit with armored car thefts as opposed to breaking out of a Nazi prison camp. It meticulously gives the story extra details, such as how the crimes are committed, how much time they have, etc. They even schedule out time for heist training and how they will carry out the whole thing. That was the cool stuff in the film. It starts to fall apart from there.Jason Statham plays a guy seeking revenge for the loss of a loved one during a heist on the street. This is where the problems start to occur in the film. You don't really care about any of the characters in this film. None of them are really likable, even Statham himself. You do not feel any pity for his character, because most of the tragedy that launches this story is his own fault. He wanders around looking all brooding and boring, totally giving away his intentions at the start of the film.There is a good supporting cast in this film, but the characters portrayed are not really worth getting behind. Even Andy Garcia's character, Agent King, makes no sense even being in the movie. He just comes across as being a sniveling weasel and pops in and out at advantageous times. You really don't feel bad for the female characters in the film either. A lot of unlikeable characters propagate this film.Speaking of Ritchie's style, one thing was bothering me. Ritchie had moments where he kept breaking the fourth wall and I am not sure if they even noticed it. When a character opens a car door to enter the car, the camera backs up so the actor can get in the car. The camera then zooms back in closer as he has a conversation with the driver. To me that was not a good move, because you basically are telling the audience, ""we had to move the camera back so the guy can get in the car"". The point is not to show that the camera is in the way of the guy getting in the car. This is a movie, not a reality TV show. There are no cameras in this parking garage.It was things like that and an uneven pace to the story that was making it hard to enjoy. There were too many flashbacks and flash-forwards. It felt like, ""three weeks ago"" or ""four months ago"" or ""two weeks later"", was happening way too often. The film spent too much time going from extremes to quiet moments, from one location to the next with not much of a warning. As the film would get going the pace would come to a halt. I did catch myself yawning a couple times. I still feel that a 6 IMDB is still a good enough movie to still go see, but maybe wait for a $5 Tuesday night showing.5.9 (D MyGrade) = 6 IMDB.",Wrath of Man

I get wanting to have an ominous vibe, which was executed beautifully via the soundtrack, but even on my great TV and lightless room did I struggle to see what the heck was going on in so many scenes. Especially that one hand to hand combat scene in a narrow hallway with two guys in all black. Also the action movie cliche of shooting 100 rounds without reloading once, using a 30 round mag, really dumbfounded me given the realism the movie carried elsewhere. Indo love Statham but his emotionlessness throughout the movie made it a tougher watch. Las Alonso and Scott Eastwood were great, as were Holt McCallany and Josh Hartnett. Some of the actions and decisions made by these ""professional"" characters with ""extensive military backgrounds"" were painfully naive. The plot, filmmaking itself, and script, were all great.

The dialogue is kinda not good, it's an edgy 14 yo wrote them. And I have no problem with swearing, I love how they swear in this and in The Gentlemen, and Ritchie really loves to implement that in his movies, but this one it's like half the script is just F word. There's not a lot of creativity with the swearing. And speaking of the script, lots of it it's just repeated lines because there's a scene that's played like 4 times. There are a lot of repetition, even though it's for the sake of the plot revealing what happened, it still feels like padding time and there's not much more to the script. It's a like movie you'd watch in the 2000s or 2010s.Again, kinda disappointed to see this from Ritchie after the amazing The Gentlemen, but it's still not a bad movie, give it a shot.",Wrath of Man

144,arabnikita,Solid Old School Action thriller,8,29 May 2021,"Wrath of Man (2021)When I saw that Guy Ritchie will be making a movie with Jason Statham, I was pumped up for an action comedy in the spirit of Snatch. To my surprise, Wrath of Man turned out to be unlike any other Guy Ritchie film but in a good kind of way. It felt like I was watching Heat or Sicario due to the level of seriousness, maturity and tension established on screen. Jason Statham played a man of a few words and stern determination who drove this film without feeling obnoxious or over the top.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Ritchie's style with his camera work, jokes and saucy characters. Here, he trades the humor and slickness for razor sharp precision and groundedness. While this is a rather simple revenge tale with Statham at the core, the plot is interesting enough to grip you the entire time as it's other characters bring something of their own to the table. Scott Eastwood was especially impressive in the role of a villain as he was able to establish his presence though body language and facial expressions much like his father Clint.I was excited for Wrath of Man and it certainly didn't disappoint. The grey setting and sorrowful soundtrack carried the somber atmosphere of grief while the well executed action with powerful sound kept the heart pumping the entire time. The poetic ending is very much in Guy Ritchie style and it wraps up this intense story in an impactful way. It's old school film about betrayal, family tragedy and brutally appropriate action. If you want a serious, mature and engaging action thriller then don't miss out on this. Cinema viewing is recommended for greater impact.Movies.shmoviws on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",Wrath of Man

Scott Eastwood in a rather memorable performance, with few lines but very effective expression as the menacing villain.The plot is OK, told from different timelines to make the story more interesting. Some of the aspects - such as Jason Statham's shooting skills - are needlessly exaggerated, while others - such as heist detailing were rather good.My main problem with movie - as someone already pointed out - is that I didn't feel anything.

Anyway, Wrath of Man is an average movie, which has highly action-oriented sequences and the gimmicks followed in the making. Somehow Jason Statham had not much to do even though dialogues he just stays like a Mass actor who only has action and less acting. It is not like other Ritchie movies but somehow feels a slight similarity with the penultimate ones The Gentleman and Revolver. Not many editing techniques are here but the shots have some sort of fluidity on the progression of the movie and hats off to Alan Stewart. Along with Cinematography the music also favors the film in a limited surrounding. There is one only piece of music in the movie which has its own echoing mood.

Well, sorta..So here's the thing, there is a good movie in there somewhere, and overall if you want to see action there's plenty of it. There's some drama, and all of that but the cut of this movie is atrocious. What I think happened is Guy Richie shot this and then decided that there weren't enough twists and turns and so he cut the second half into the first half, and then to make up for the confusion put a couple of ""5 months later"" in there. The problem is it doesn't actually track. Because of the way it was cut it becomes blatantly transparent what actually happened in the first 20 minutes of the movie, so you spend the other hour and half watching how they got to that point which is kind of meh.7/10 it had the right elements and a good plot but it needs to be recut to the directors cut and not whatever this thing ended up being.",Wrath of Man

The plot changes to crime mystery, action film, ocean eleven/Italian Job plot, and closes with an anticlimactic scene of revenge.The movie had a great concept.

I enjoy Jason Statham's cool, calm, and collected performance as a quiet yet fascinating guy with secret deadly skills. The movie starts out compelling enough, and as a way to tease the viewer with explanations to the mystery, it uses flashbacks - a lot of flashbacks that are too long that it makes you think why didn't they just start out with them to begin with. It's because flashbacks are a cheap trick; in this movie they are overdone and just make the plot unnecessarily convoluted.

Jason walks through the movie from start to finish. No snappy one-liners, no martial arts to make you go wow, just walking and shooting with the same look all the way through the movie. I think he was supposed to be grieving over the death of his son but the flashback didn't sell me the affection they should have had.The flashbacks were jarring and in your face. This is not unusual for a Guy Richie movie but in this one it wasn't part of a snappy story (like Lock Stock) so they only succeeded in taking you out of the movie. And one flashback in particular felt like it was jammed in as an after thought to explain the plot. The camaraderie between the Armoured Guards was weird. Everyone had the same dialogue, one liners and actions. As if it was written by one person from their perspective.....oh wait. Like watching one person acting many roles.Not sure how the love scene came about, it and the resulting sub-story (the money he found) had nothing to do with the story and never got mentioned again. It didn't need to be in the movie. I kept wondering why he parked where he did to get his burrito just before his son gets shot. It was way past the fastfood truck and front gates of the armoured truck entry and so unnecessary except to make sure the boy was caught up in the hold-up. There are a few more scenes like this but I think you get the picture,Certainly not one of either JS or GR's best. It didn't let Jason loose to do his thing, and that's why we find his movies so fascinating and also why we ignore certain plot holes.

193,tvdefrancesco,Guy Ritchie Enters a New Realm of Film Making,9,16 May 2021,"First off I want to say Snatch is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time of not number 1. I absolutely love that movie. Like many of Guy Ritchie's films that came before Wrath of Man; Snatch, Lock Stock, Rock n Rola, and The Gentlemen they were all light hearted Gangsta movies that at their heart are comedies. They all had excellent plots that were interesting and had a way of introducing a wide spectrum of characters that inexplicably come together at the end. Wrath of Man was no different in this regard.The story was told out of order almost Terentino style but keeping with some of Guy Ritchie's work in the past. The thing that separates this movie is there is zero comic relief, and our hero is an intense psychopath that maybe says 35 words the entire movie. But it works! The intense music is the driving force of the movie. There's an especially good musical number when H's crew kidnaps and tortures rival crews looking for answers. You also learn very little about H which makes his character all the more mysterious.The scene at the end of the movie was iconic. It was intense and must have been so difficult to shoot. Reminded me a little of the Fenway Park robbery in the town. We learn by the end of the movie that it's not just H's wrath in the title. Crews torturing and killing other crews. Military units are angry and start robbing trucks, then killing innocents, then turning on their brothers for money. There was plenty of wrath to go around.",Wrath of Man
194,M_Exchange,I liked it.,7,17 May 2021,"It's a fall from Guy Ritchie's last movie (The Gentlemen), but then again I don't expect two legendary back-to-back movies from any living director aside from Martin Scorsese.I have a few minor complaints, and one major complaint.Major complaint: I wanted H (Statham's character) to kill Bullet. I think that most of the people who watched this movie wound up hating that traitorous psycho even more than the main villain.",Wrath of Man

196,darkwizard404,Expected much more,5,24 July 2021,"I was expecing a lot more than what was shown. When there's Jason Statham and the plot is about robbery, one can naturally expect a huge action entertainer which is what I had expected. The action scenes were not as good as I expected and not enough to satisfy those who usually enjoy Jason's action films. Guy Ritchie should have understood this and given us what we want. Instead we got some boring flashbacks which wasted a lot of time, the time which could have been used to show some good action. I have to say I was a little disappointed.",Wrath of Man
197,Aries_Primal,We've seen worst,5,17 October 2021,"We've seen worst by Jason.

Played perfect the role, just the role wasn't the best.End was fair, kinda predictable, too many blood and bang-bang, kinda it's so easy to shoot and kill a person that every character in this production is doing it so easy.As I said, fair, not good, won't watch it again.",Wrath of Man
198,shawnmikedryer,Solid Ritchie Action thriller,8,3 August 2021,"Another stylistically told Guy Ritchie tale with all the twists, turns, & double crosses we've come to expect in his movies. The dark atmosphere bodes very well, the script is fantastic & the cinematography is top notch. Jason Statham is a human wrecking ball as he does his best John Wick impersonation, the mystery shrouding his character is very interesting early on. The only nitpick i'd have the story structure seems to take a major shift midway. It was nice to get a better sense of the mysterious man's motives and who he's really aiming for but initially it got pretty confusing but grew on me once it picked up steam again and delivered an ending that we hoped for in a very Guy Ritchie style fashion. Not his absolute best work but a pretty satisfying action flick none the less.",Wrath of Man

I'll keep this short and sweet, I loved it.Yes, his style of movie isn't for everyone. I'm sure if I had the patience or time I'd read some lower rated reviews complaining about the timeline of the movie and how it weaves back and forth. I personally like that style. It adds context to the story and is an easy way to build your characters.I loved the grit and violence. It felt realistic in many ways. This was never going to be a happy story. I also was impressed with how solid the cast was.To summarize, Wrath of Man is a perfect movie for action fans. Cant wait to see what Guy Ritchie does next.",Wrath of Man
200,filmtravel101,Guy Ritchie transporter script - well done yet not a masterpiece,6,28 May 2021,"I love Guy Ritchie films and was looking forward to this film. It is definitely entertaining and yet nothing really spectacular so watch with low expectations as it feels like Ritchie dusted off some old transporter-like script in his closet during Covid and gave it a very complex story line that comes together in a typical shoot out finale like all other action heist films in the theme of Heat..The acting is solid but the music is a bit morose and annoying like a never ending Cello, and the editing is a bit off also. Regardless it is a solid film yet hard to imagine that Ritchie is the director as it has none of the flair and originality of his other films like Lock Stock, Sherlock,etc or the cool quick edit /effects and fantastic music.Jason Statham is his usual self and pulls of his part in a stellar manner and the supporting actors also... yet sad to see Josh Harnett in a minor role and Scott Eastwood is a big plus that deserves more high end films..A solid 6 and looking forward to next Ritchie film.",Wrath of Man
201,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"Gripping ""less is more"" heist thriller from Guy Ritchie",8,6 June 2021,"Wrath of Man is a gripping heist thriller that succeeds from Guy Ritchie's detailed and careful direction, telling a familiar genre story in an unfamiliar and engaging fashion. While it doesn't break new ground for its genre or win any awards, it is a solid thrill ride.Fortico Security, an armored security cash truck company, hast lost two employees from a recent robbery. The company hires Patrick Hill, a mysterious newcomer who is surprisingly overqualified for the job and has an agenda of his own beyond transporting millions of dollars across Los Angeles.We tend to think of Guy Ritchie's crime comedies as his true authorial voice as if the genre definitively represents Guy Ritchie as a storyteller. I disagree. Since Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, his crime comedies have acted as his commercial safeguard and they've been progressively worse every time he's remade Lock Stock. The Gentlemen was the third time he poured old wine in a new bottle and it is sour vinegar now.Ritchie's talent lies in how he punctuates his scenes, infusing them with style through music, camera work and editing. His genre films fare better for this reason; the two Sherlock Holmes and The Man from U. N. C. L. E are fun entertainment. My personal favorite thing from Guy Ritchie is Star, a BMW short starring Madonna and Clive Owen, which was a 7-minute joke but hilariously told in the Guy Ritchie fashion.For Wrath of Man, Ritchie's direction is refined and non-flashy. Everything is stripped to its pure narrative function and it creates a believable reality around these cash truck security guards dealing with problems at work. It sucks you right in.This is the most engaged I have been in a Guy Ritchie film. Normally with his films, I am usually accustomed to waiting for the next joke or thrill. This time, I was eagerly watching the story unfold and anticipating what would happen next. He's in top form here.Under Ritchie's ""less is more"" direction, Jason Statham pulls back a lot and delivers a much more subdued character than we're familiar with and showcases a fresh side of himself since his comedic turn in Spy. Holt McCallany from Mindhunter also shines in his role as Statham's partner in the cash truck. No actor stole focus and just served the story. I wished more movies were made with this spirit.I really enjoyed Wrath of Man. This is going on my list of Top Ten of 2021. We'll see if it stays there by the end of the year.",Wrath of Man
202,panta-4,Entertaining,8,27 May 2021,"Guy Ritchie directing a movie with Jason Statham as a lead... what more could you want? This time is an English language remake of the 2004 French film Cash Truck... and it was made the best possible way!The ""Wrath of Man"" is a movie which is strictly here to entertain and it did it with style: good lighting, good sounds, good script, great acting, etc. Interesting way of dividing the story into 3 acts. The second act is heavy on exposition, so it does slow the story down just a little bit, but it never gets boring. I would even say that this was one of the best action/thrillers in years, or you could view it as a solid heist film.Sit down and get your drinks and snacks - and be ready to have fun!",Wrath of Man
203,waltermwilliams,Not Guy Ritchies finest hour,5,4 May 2021,"Govn'r this is not Guy Ritchies finest hour.As a movie critic I've liked nearly everything the man has created...apart from his marriage to Madonna and his remakes.In ""Wrath of Man"" he's teamed up with one of films most likeable, tough, bald, UK guys, Jason Statham as H.Who for need of brevity is nicknamed that by Holt McCallanys' Bullet.""Wrath of Man"" is a remake of the French film, ""Cash Truck"" or ""Le Convoyeur"", so not even original.It also goes under that title in other markets...just not Australia.However Richie is prone to remakes following in the footsteps of ""Swept Away"" and ""Aladdin"".Maybe he should stick to original ideas in light of this information.And it's basically a heist, revenge film revolving around the world of Cash Trucks literally.After ""Revolver"" it's only the second film Ritchie has primarily set Stateside and this time Los Angeles is the back drop.I recognise it because I've played ""Midnight Club"" on those streets of LA before and one day when this pandemic settles down i'd like to visit it, but I just don't want to meet up with H or his thug mates in a dark alley off Hollywood and Vine anytime soon.This is not like any other Ritchie movie and I guess that's what we go to see...his special edits and story telling through the narration of a main character.Instead we get a heist movie like so many others in the history of cinema.H is a cold, hard mysterious newbie at a cash truck company and responsible for moving millions of dollars around La La Land each week...then his real back story unfolds and things get ugly and violent quickly in this action, thriller.Unfortunately for the film goer not a lot of time was spent on this screenplay, so the dialogue is clunky, unfunny and the acting is wooden.At one point they are searching high and low for Scott Eastwoods character, Jan.I could have saved them a lot of time, bone breaking and bullets by just saying, ""the guy looks a lot like a young Clint Eastwood...in an uncanny way.""
Just once i want to see this in one of Eastwood Jnr's films, now that would be funny.Fun Fact: Statham and Eastwood also worked together on ""The Fate of the Furious"" from that huge franchise.I care a lot about the movies I watch every week and even appearances by Andy Garcia as Agent King and Jeffrey Donovan from ""Burn Notice"" couldn't lift ""Wrath of Man"" higher than a middle level rating for me.I remember the days of ""The Gentlemen"", Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"".This one has toned down that comedy element in favour of full ahead crime.",Wrath of Man

TBH it would have been better had he let them escape with the money and tracked them down and killed them and all their families.... in a gross over reaction kind of way. That would have fitted more with the cold hearted mafia vibe and the title of the movie. Meh.,Wrath of Man
206,jsucie,Fun but too long,7,1 August 2021,"This is more of a toned down Jason Statham movie. Not quite the action we are used to seeing from him but it was still a fun ride nonetheless. It was a little excessively long though and probably could have used more time in the editing bay.Honestly the most frustrating part which seem hard to believe considering how much time devoted to it was simply that this highly trained soldier kills the kid and shoots the dad and they have this long stare down as Statham lay ""dying"" yet the final action heist part this same trained soldier doesn't recognize him at all & they spend probably close to 30min fictional movie time together.

The direction was excellent and put this head and shoulders above most other action movies I've seen. All the firefights were tense and visceral, the acting very good and the pacing excellent.If you had told me beforehand how much of the movie would involve flashbacks I would not have been impressed but it actually really worked here and made a threadbare story surprisingly engaging.This is not a groundbreaking movie. The plot is pretty generic, it's not particularly smart and It's kind of obvious what's going to happen in the end but it's the high quality execution of it all that lifts this film way above the competition.",Wrath of Man
209,neener3707,Another Gritty Worthwhile Crime Flick From Guy Ritchie,7,9 May 2021,"I love Guy Ritchie films, I saw this on a whim and didn't know it was him until the opening credits. So when I saw that I knew I was in for a white knuckle action fueled ride that I would love. And while its obviously not his best, by a long shot actually, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and I recommended it to friends and family. But a masterpiece it was not.Good thing I didn't watch the trailer because going in blind, not knowing the story that was (for the most part) spoiled in the trailer, I enjoyed the semi-done before revenge plot. But the grit, the tension, and the action is what made it all for me. Jason Statham often become his own cliché in his own movies but not this one. The whole film was dirty, it felt gritty, and I love films that don't just show nice cinematography and sets, but instead have a consistent tone that makes you feel like you're in it. And of course the action is good, we already mentioned who this is coming from, the final ""heist"" of sorts was very entertaining and the action was intense and well filmed.I did find the editing weird in a couple of spots, just a couple of moments and one entire segment I felt did not really flow with the rest of the film and kind of take you out of it, It would take up some time to say which scenes but you'll know them when you see them. Oddly cut, either to quick or just in an odd fashion, and an entire segment of the film that serves as backstory for me personally, was placed it a bad spot I also loved the score, it was very simplistic yet unnerving and effective. Only added good to the gritty imagery and tone we were looking at.All in all its a solid action thriller that is no masterpiece but still worth a watch if you like the genre.",Wrath of Man
210,M0vieL0ver,Good revenge flick,7,31 May 2021,I thought the movie was classic for a Guy Ritchie and Jason Stratham film. I do like revenge type films. Jason's character was a bit too mysterious for me. Too many holes in that part of the story. And the violence was quite graphic.,Wrath of Man

It reminded me of Fatale which I watched a few nights before, in that there are no ""good guys"" at the end of the day.

The skewed timeline approach worked perfectly, and at times needed and delivered---giving the viewer different ""angles"" of what actually happened in a few integral scenes.Statham hasn't done anything for me to be honest.

218,BibChr,"Disappointing, promise wasted",4,21 May 2021,"I like Jason Statham, Holt McCallany, and Scott Eastwood as actors. From the buzz of the reviews, I expected to enjoy this. For the first few minutes, my hopes began to be realized...until they weren't.The story starts of very sure-footedly, with one of several clever filming decisions - the use of a single-angle camera shot. A lot happened off-camera. This was the first of many moments where the viewer knew something big was happening, that he wasn't privy to all of it, and that it would eventually be unfolded. This is a mark of good storytelling. If only it had carried through.The introduction of Statham's character is also very effective, as one immediately senses there is more to him than meets the eye. But the moment Holt McCallany steps in, all friendliness and helpfulness, I think, ""He might be an overcompensating bad guy."" It was an amateurish telegraphed move. Casting an unknown, or a little more greyness in his character, would have worked better.Then a brutal and violent plot unfolds, stepping back and forth in the timeline. It is effective as far as it goes. But the moment they say there's an insider, I think ""McCallany or Marsan"" (the two known names ""inside""; the first the overly helpful character played by a known actor, the second a British actor doing an American accent and being a bit fishy).I groaned when the evil team turned out to be bitter soldiers, kind of a cheap gimmick. (When, later, one of them sells out his brothers for money, the folly is complete.)But everything goes entirely south when McCallany decides to explain to Statham that he's the insider, there's going to be a robbery, and ""H"" (Statham) needs to shut up and cooperate (for no reward) or die. We're to believe he'd do that, with Statham just sitting there within windpipe-chopping distance, sitting by an openable door, with McCallany's character having seen what a fearless and deadly machine Statham is. We're also to believe that Statham would not have noticed that his gun has no bullets.This is a plausibility crash and burn moment. To me the movie never recovers. Nice-guy McCallany turns into a total monster for the remainder, until his predictable death.Two final notes. As I said, I like Statham. The camera likes him, gifting him with several extended shots. This movie (and camerawork) provides countless opportunities for Statham to expand his range as an actor. He takes advantage of exactly none of them. Statham maintains the same single grim expression throughout, without the slightest shift or nuance.So all ""H: is is a grim, vengeful, usually-efficient character. You're sorry his son was killed, but you don't care a bit for him. At no point does he show a glimmer of humanity or complexity. Bad directing? Bad acting? Bad, anyway.More largely, apart from the son (murdered after a couple of minutes' screen time), the movie gives us almost nobody to like or care for, and kills virtually everybody anyway. So it's grim, implausible, and only occasionally fun to watch. The flashes of skill and intelligence are more tantalizing and frustrating than satisfying.Expected to like it, sorry to be disappointed.",Wrath of Man

221,PerryAtTheMovies,Another enjoyable Statham film....,6,13 June 2021,"My rating: 6/10This film was rather entertaining. The story was engaging. Perfect amount of action, toned down swearing, and no over the top results. Flashbacks were utilized throughout, but they are appropriately placed, thus allowing the film to flow smoothly and eventually end on a conclusive note that wasn't perfect, but it was still conclusive.As always, Jason Statham was fun to watch. I've always enjoyed his deep, grim British persona. Though this character may look the same as his other roles. I felt that this was one of his more humanized roles. It wasn't just about killing the bad guys. There was a rhyme and reason behind his character's motives and enhanced my appreciation for the character.Sound mixing and music enhanced this film. I'm starting to learn how to identify a directors mannerisms. For instance, compared to ""The Gentlemen"" (2019), I noticed the ticks, tacks, and the toks that went to certain actions and movements. Everything blended to let you know that this was a Guy Ritchie film. While this film wasn't a home run in my books. Sounds of the film played a part in keeping it from bombing all the way down.The downsides of the film are spoiler related so I'll be vague. I felt that opportunities were wasted in some instances that had me going ""what were you thinking"". Certain characters did stuff that had me shaking my head and certain parts near the end had me somewhat dismayed by the consequences.Overall, for a Statham film it felt toned down in the swearing department which probably made it more enjoyable. The story was engaging, sounds of the film were key, and characters were likeable. Perhaps you won't want to pay the Home Premier price, but once it's available for a regular rental, or brought to a streaming service, I would recommend giving this one a watch.Enjoy the show!",Wrath of Man

The only thing bringing all the pieces together is an annoying soundtrack that underlies everything.The dialogue was forced, not funny, not light or witty and felt like the actors were reading off a monitor. I got tired of their drone combined with the incessant music track.Maybe the challenges of filming during COVID brought this movie down? I dunno, but it was a disappointment for me.",Wrath of Man

He survives (of course) but has only one thing on his mind; find out who killed his son and take him to the cleaners as they say.

Even in the side-roles: suddenly there is Andy Garcia, and he is perfect for the role. I didn't know he is even on the list. The same goes for Lyne Renee. Nobody is annoying or embarrassing. And there is Jason Stratham - he is such an ass-kicker who only talks if necessary. He appears calm, but he is not calm at all inside. He is pretty much the opposite... you will love his role. Some scenes remind me of a Tarantino movie without the funny scenes, some scenes remind me of ""Heat"" but honestly, I think it's even better than Heat. And in the end, it's very different. A must-watch. So, watch it.",Wrath of Man

235,rchevalier-37303,Hard gritty and terrific,9,8 June 2021,Some think Ritchie has lost his edge. I disagree. There is minimal humour to be sure and it's a very dark film. It does move along well despite the time jumps that Ritchie likes. Scott Eastwood is a bit over the top but is a counterpoint to the very level Statham. It's nothing more than what it is and does a terrific job.,Wrath of Man
236,hkpolarbear,Good guys win over bad guys afterall,4,29 May 2021,This is a story Guy trying hard to twist as much as possible about Good vs Bad. But it's still blurred who is the bad guy yet Jason does not seem to be a good guy himself to me. I still don't understand how he finally find the right person who shot his son though. May be that is why Guy Ritchie is a director and I can only be an audience in the theatre.😅,Wrath of Man
237,chris-h-3,Average b-movie actioner.,5,26 May 2021,"It starts off well and the switch into the first action scene is great but after that when it starts going back and forth in the timeline it gets a bit dull and loses that momentum.Feels like a film from the 90's and probably would've made more sense, plot wise, were it set in that era.I don't remember the original all that well, as it came out so many years ago, but I can see I rated it and 8/10 so it was a lot better than this. From what I remember it was more a realistic heist/crime film with a much tighter story and direction.If you like Jason Statham's previous films you will likely enjoy this as even with its faults it is above average for a Jason Statham movie.",Wrath of Man
238,jcallows,The Los Angeles Job,8,9 June 2021,"Here's another film about a guy with hidden talents. What's different about it? It does a good job of creating a mystery as to the protagonist's motivations. It also has well shot action sequences and cleverly planned heists. It feels like a cross between John Wick and Den of Thieves/Italian Job/Heat.Though it's not at the level of a John Wick, it does require you to have a fair amount of suspension of disbelief. Our hero does have incredible shooting accuracy and amazing healing powers. Also, it asks you to believe armor truck heists happen all the time. You'd think after a string of heists in the same city in the span of a few months the cops would be on high alert and security companies would be better prepared but whatever.Overall I enjoyed this film. It's Jason Stratham's best work since his other revenge heist film, The Italian Job.",Wrath of Man

Jason Statham provides a one-note but ferocious performance as the blood thirsty H, while the action plays in four distinct non-linear parts.

248,ty-jensen,Gritty crime thriller!,7,17 June 2021,"I was excited for Wrath of Man since I like Jason Statham, Josh Hartnett and Guy RItchie. My cinemas re-opened the other day so I was finally able to see the film. Wrath of Man is a badass crime thriller.The acting was good including Statham and I easily understand why some people think he's bad. Statham plays stoic characters and H is really stoic. H is cold and unassuming so he really sticks out. Hartnett's character is a wimp who acts macho. Hartnett's voice is really deep but it's naturally high when he acts scared. Having said that, the characters are thin, you just know their names and motivations.The story is complex so it's really easy to feel lost. Ritchie likes non-linear storytelling, this movie is told in four parts. No spoilers but you see a major event from three perspectives. The pacing is good but uneven: the second act is rushed a little and the third act is stretched out a little.Wrath of Man is gritty so it's not a typical Ritchie film. It's one of those films which makes you think ""that's brutal"" or ""that's nasty."" Like I said H is cold, he's not a good person. The first act has dry humor which was okay. The film takes place in America but it was filmed in England.Wrath of Man isn't an action movie, it has two shoot-outs and that's it. There's no martial arts like in the Transporter movies. There could of been a quick car chase, maybe it was considered.Overall, Wrath of Man is a gritty crime thriller. It's not like The Gentlemen or Snatch. The film is a hard R so it's really not for everyone. If you like Statham, you may want to see it sometime. Statham and Hartnett just made another film with Ritchie, a spy film which should be better.",Wrath of Man

I'm sure he will.",Wrath of Man
250,SebMoz,Feels slightly off-balance,6,29 May 2021,"I really wish I could say that this is a new high for Ritchie, that it capitalizes on his strengths and compensates for his weaknesses. Unfortunately, I would lie by saying that. This movie misses something crucial about Ritchies movies, something that makes him a great director. His best movies all do this expertly; it's the balance between lighthearted and serious, the juxtaposition between the often brutal plots and the lighthearted banter and conflicts between the characters. He's kinda similar to Tarantino in that regard, except that Tarantino has proven himself to also be excellent at making purely serious movies, and Ritchie hasn't convinced me he can do that, not as of now at least.It's a shame, because there's a lot to like in this movie. The cinematography is solid as usual, the pacing is tight, the overall structure is efficient and makes for a good setup, and the performances are fine, even though the script doesn't require too much of any of the actors. The score is excellent as well, and while the sound design isn't anything special, it still works as intended.None of the characters interested me though, not even H. The whole 'revenge after losing a loved one'-trope has been worn out a little by now. I feel like we've seen a little too many dark vengeance plots in recent years for me to really be affected by it anymore, which is a shame, since I've always been a massive fan of revenge stories.So, at the end of the day, this is just a standard movie for me. Not great, kinda good, not super memorable. Maybe the prospect of Ritchie and Statham working together made my expectations too high, I don't know. All I know is that I liked this movie, but I wish it did more for me.",Wrath of Man

The strong start veered sharply off course with 45 minutes of background that frankly could have been a 10 minute history. In the end it drags and you end up not caring about any of the characters. Even the protagonist seems like a pretty bad guy. In the end just a very average heist movie that is only in theaters because of the names attached.,Wrath of Man

259,cristinalinderman,An outstanding glorious action film.,10,9 June 2021,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Guy Ritchie and crew brought an outstanding glorious action film. What a movie! I was so engaged, I didn't dare to blink with such an incredibly dark story. This is one of the best action films out there and I would recommend it immensely. The story was so appropriately dark and thankfully it didn't stray to give any light humor and the direction was perfectly paced with it. The changing timelines were superb it didn't miss the beat of the story making one slowly feel the pull of the character's darkness. I wouldn't change anything there wasn't any scene I didn't like, all of it clicked beautifully. I expected greatness from Guy Ritchie's direction but I didn't expect how much I truly loved and enjoy the film. This revenge film makes any other revenge movie feel weak compare to how powerful everything unfolded.The composer Chris Benstead blew my mind with his music. He brought the story and the main character to a whole new level of more darkness. His music set the perfect rhythm to create an intense shadow of emotion towards the main character and how it flowed gracefully with his menacing actions. It also blew my mind how a Johnny Cash song which was a different dark version made the scene more strong and keeps the same atmosphere as the dark tone in the composer's music.The cast was beyond perfect, everyone gave their performance of their lives. So many great known actors and some new ones I haven't had the pleasure to see in other films but they were all incredible, not one of them acted as rookies everyone was magnificent. The significant praise goes to the main actor Jason Statham, he is literally the best action star. I have seen him in so many great films and he never fails in his acting skills. I have to say this was my favorite role of Jason Statham because he took his character in such a dark way and he never faltered in showing any humor. His character was so serious and so dangerous it makes one blood boil to watch how his actions keep being incredibly menacing and so destructive without care. His portrayal has no words and he kept me completely engaged throughout the entirety of the film. I wouldn't mind watching a prequel or even a sequel anything just to watch more of his character, I really didn't want the movie to end.",Wrath of Man

Unlike ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Snatch,"" both ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies with Robert Downey Jr, this one isn't played for laughs.H"" (played by Jason Statham) is cash truck driver in LA, whose thwarting of a robbery leads to his skillset with guns and mysterious past being questioned.The tone is actually quite somber as ""H"" embarks on a mission to infiltrate a security guard company in order to find the identities of a group of robbers who killed his son.Not too deep, but lots of 'polish', score is impressive, direction is sublime - in other words everything is very believable.If you desperately need a testosterone boost, look no further.",Wrath of Man

Superbanal, but i think fine for one time with popcorn.",Wrath of Man
263,jgkelley-48797,Wrath of Man is the type of movie...,8,24 June 2021,"That when you're finished, you find yourself thanking God you are not one of those people who see a movie like this & pretend it sucks. You know it was great & feel a sense of worth & meaning cuz you realize your life might not be as bad as it sometimes seems. Cuz you realize, you could always be that small % of folks who see a movie with little flaws & somehow feel the urge to rip it apartI read a low few reviews & see them mention ""weak dialogue"". Ok, let's overanalyze every last detail of a movie. This movie wasn't made for the dialogue. It is made to keep people in suspense as the lead up into action takes place. For much of the movie, you know something, but you don't know anything. You're trying to piece the puzzle together. And each scene gives you another piece to fit in. The plot was great. I saw nothing wrong with the dialogue. If you wanted more, I don't what you wanted squeezed in that would've tickled your odd fetish fancy. There was no dead space. Or scenes where I can fathom why anyone would think more discussion or lines would be necessary. The action was great when it came time for it. The acting was great. The way the stories were setup & came together was brilliant. I should probably give the movie a 9. But I think 8 is still a really good movie. And the ending was karmic & the balls. You don't need to be a Statham fan to love this movie. But if you are, he certainly doesn't disappoint. Don't listen to negative reviews. Luckily there is so many good ones, I'm guessing you won't. Hell we should just all ignore anyone who makes the quotes, ""worst movie ever"" or ""seen this one before"" as those people are clearly just lazy, haterz or trolls. Some of em prob hate the genre they review, making em bias & making you question why the even watching the movie to begin with let alone reviewing it if they are bias & hate a genre. The been there, seen that people are clueless anyways. Everything has been done before to a point. I mean millions of movies have been made ova the last 100+yrs of movie making. Humans are not very complex. Everything has been done before & so peeps need to stop expecting fresh plots. Doesn't mean there can't be a fresh take on a plot tho & just cuz you seen certain actors in a movie live through a plot, you haven't seen another set of actors & characters do it. Hell millions of people cheat every day. So if a movie was made based on infidelity, it means any movie every made on infidelity after that is ranked 1 star or the worst movie ever. It's a stupid pre-requisite to say that every movie needs a plot that hasn't been done. It's unrealistic, foolish, naive & ignorant. Just cuz Suzy cheats on Billy, doesn't mean another movie where Betsy cheats on Mike is a ripoff. Swap out any plot with infidelity & the point remains. Just cuz you seen a movie about 1 thing doesn't mean another movie can't do it. Could have identical plots which few movies ever do as there are always at least subtle changes if not massive ones. But just say they are identical aside from the character. Just cuz you have seen one group of people go through situations, so what, that means another group of actors & characters can't? Ridiculous. Rant yes, but we'll worth it to put those fools on blast for such a stupid reason to kill a movie. Things like acting, how the scenes are edited together, whether the story makes sense & things like that should matter. And when I say make sense, I mean it's not just a bunch of rubbish. I don't mean if it's a sci-fi movie, overanalyze the math or the logic. That's just insanely stupid. Unless it's something like the movie, ""ticking clock"" with Cuba Gooding. Where any simpleton understand the ending cant happen that way. When you need to pull in quantum physics, or dealing with something the average person can overlook, you prob crossing the line into being hardo.",Wrath of Man

This time it was actually dark and serious , which is way different Than his Previous works , And he did Quite a brillant job to overcome this new Challenge !👍
-First of All , I would like to praise Jason Statham's Performance who succeded to deliver a Perfect combination of Emotions And character's Layers from opacity and complexity around his Personnality to the Anger and Seek of Vengeance from those who led him to take this Road
And thus He indeed embodied a dark , Sadistic Spirit with Charismatic , Remarkable interpretation 👌👏
-Second , This Was a very well established , Solid plot with Multiple elements and layers consolidated in an Engaging story
-The Screenwriting is So convincing and coherent 🖋
-The Narrative was so captivating , even though the movie was Full of mysteries in the first half hour , but that choice of narrative Proved its worth by Outstanding Outcomes in the final Act of the Movie
-The Rhythm And pacing 📈 Were So Balanced and didn't have any Elements that could Confuse the Viewer or ruin the Experience
-The Editing was Amazingly accomplished in a way to keep you impatiently expecting what's more to come
-The soundtrack 🎵 Had a great , Powerful impact in rooting and building the momentum 📈👌
Adding to that to keep the audience in an intensive place
-Great variety in the Action Sequences 💥
-The cinematography Was Also such a powerful element in the movie , like the constant Movement Of camera during every single Scene and the zooming in and out which bring the Audience Even more closer to the situationFinal Rating : 8/10 ✅👌",Wrath of Man

I found it very engaging and wasn't ever bored. I didn't drift away during the shoot outs, which I often do in action films. No, the characters aren't likable but they're not meant to be.

282,urbanswami,The gentleman highwayman,10,25 May 2021,"Guy Ritchie's gratest gift to mankind is his obsession with gangsters. In his portrayal the typical hard-boiled criminal has class. He's ruthless and brutal, but lives by an inviolable code that sets a hierarchy of values and clearly drawn lines which cannot be crossed. Most of the violance stems from others crossing said lines. The story may change, but the characters' demeanor never does. While the movie bares the marks of Guy's signature style, it's his darkest work yet. Highly recommended for watching.",Wrath of Man

Some truly awful dialogue that is delivered well but takes you out of a scene""The tree was shook, and it was shook hard"".Loses steam after first 30-45 minutes.

They can put up a fight, but not defeating an army. Well, that, an interesting story, and the dark humor.This movie has non of the above, what makes me wonder, is this actually a Guy Ritchie film? Because it felt more like a regular Jason Statham movie, not different to ""The Transporter"": a man of steel fighting n' shooting, and not much else.

301,thatfilmperson,"A dark ""The Gentlemen""",8,15 September 2021,"If you liked:
Nobody
The Gentlemen
The Departed""Wrath of Men"" starts of as a generic, typical action film with an unkillable badass main character that has some shady background and a mysterious revenge incentive in his mind which will only gradually be unveiled as the film progresses. I usually hate these kinds of movies, I cannot force myself to watch films like ""insert any Jason Statham picture"", e.g. Transporter, Crank or any of the Furious films. At this point I just can't not pay attention to character development, acting, and coherent storyline (or lack thereof) and was never really able to enjoy these movies at all. What annoys me the most is the overly confident pretentious dialogues ubiquitous in these films, where everybody inevitably sounds like a 13-year-old trying to be the ""tough guy"".So generally, I would just skip films like this entirely, and the reason why I could not skip on ""Wrath of Man"" is simple - Guy Ritchie. I love the Guy (huhu), I watched his ""Sherlock Holmes"" about 10 times, and it was the first film I've ever seen entirely in English. I also at the very least enjoyed his ""King Arthur"" and latest ""The Gentlemen"", so despite the big red flag in the face of Jason Statham on the poster, my expectations were pretty high for this one. But the first hour is exactly what you would expect of it - it feels like you've watched this exact movie a hundred times over and over again - there's bad acting, there's pretentious dialogue, there's a typical bully character that nobody likes and that seems to inherently dislike our main character for some dumb reasons, but really is a coward who can't really stand up for himself; there's our main character who is quiet but turns godlike when it counts; there's the predictable gradual story development - it's an overused formula that is familiar to any viewer at this point, and there were moments where I lost all hope and almost didn't want to keep watching anymore. But, although it does it very slowly, the story develops into first something original and interesting, and then something exciting and actually gripping, to the point where I allowed myself to close my eyes on the obvious flaws. Don't expect this to be a crime comedy like the hilarious ""The Gentlemen"", this film is hardcore crime, showing the ugliest parts of the ugliest men. It almost turns into some kind of dark, twisted poetry towards the end; and despite the fact that for the most part the film is a copy of a copy of a copy, it can become The Copy which comes to mind when we think of movies of such genre.Also, Post Malone and Scott Eastwood (Clint Eastwood's clone of a son who I stared at for 2 hours trying to understand who the hell he reminds me of so much) are in this movie.",Wrath of Man

Didn't much mind Jason Statham in it, one of the main things that annoyed me initially, although he is rather flat in this. There are some interesting developments, but in aspects of a particular event set up, it made the person who did something murderous appear to do so with some measure of regret, as if they didn't feel they had an alternative, the character seeming a lot different later. It was though they were filming it with a sense of an alternative direction in mind, went somewhere else entirely, and didn't think to reshoot one of the earlier scenes to account for that.

A town, the job is dangerous as we saw at the beginning there are serious occupational hazards. A few days into his first work week Statham shows an incredible aptitude for the job, but The Statham is hiding a bigger secret, and the music tells us all is not well.Wrath of Man is as brawny and haggard as the posters makes it out to be, swooning cello soundtracks and drab L. A vistas tell us this is VERY serious. The Statham is hiding something from us and his colleagues, noticeable by the fact he doesn't flinch, ever. We have a massive back story, a lot of gangsta types and henchmen looking concerned and then a switch in narrative as we see the inner workings of a massive heist.The heist element is handled well, Ritchie has studied the genre and know where to ramp up the action. The cast is strong, all actors look appropriately moody and tense as if they know that the Statham is angry, and must pick their words wisely. The flaw is in the plotting, whilst Ritchie is a pro with this type of fare, making his name with Lock Stock, Snatch, RocknRolla and the likes, he has a flair for crime dramas/comedy and handles the scenes suitably, BUT the script is SO dense with plot threads that it all does not make a cohesive whole. The set up of mystery man joining a courier service shifts to a revenge drama and then refocuses on a heist movie. I feel he should have picked a genre, because both are good but together they serve to conflate.All that being said, Ritchie continues to be a director worth watching, and in Statham we have artist and muse re-United after a long absence.

315,jaredkjacoby,I Felt Tense in the Theater...,8,15 May 2021,"Patrick Hill lands a new job as cash truck driver at the armored-truck company, Fortico Security. Despite having average training performances, he quickly proves to be one of the most effective guards at Fortico when he takes out a group of bandits that attack him and his partner. Soon, he is tasked to investigate the murder of two guards by a different group of robbers disguised as construction workers. At this same robbery, Hill suffered a tragedy that destroyed him internally. This gives Hill both a professional motivation and a personal motivation.Me and my mom moved again and we just happen to have an AMC theater that is walking distance from us. Today, I decided to take advantage of having a movie theater near me and see this film. I knew almost nothing about Guy Ritchie's new movie except it stars Jason Statham and it is an action thriller. However, I did learn that it was a theater-only film and I wanted to take advantage of that as well. The result is a very pleasant surprise.Guy Ritchie's Wrath of Man seems like a generic action thriller at first glance, but it is elevated by his slick direction, strong performances from the cast and the solid writing. What I like about this movie so much are the characters. None of them are outright heroic, not even Patrick Hill, the protagonist. In fact, he could be considered a villain protagonist. He has a dark past involved with criminal activity and he is ruthless. However, he does have a moral code and sympathetic qualities. When he is dealing with his fractured family, I could not help but feel sorry for him despite his stoicness. That being said, he is definitely not a role model. His partner seemed like a wimp at first, but he grew on me in the third act. The villains in the film are a mixed bag, but pretty good overall. Some of the robbers are about as morally grey and sympathetic as Hill, but a couple of them are pretty despicable and I wanted to see them get their just desserts. Some of the robbers get good development and personalities, others are not so lucky. I think the movie could have done a little better with a few of them, but the robbers make for compelling antagonists overall. The characters make the film so much more intense, especially considering how morally grey everyone is here. I actually was having a hard time who was going to come out on top in the story.Performance-wise, Scott Eastwood gives one of his best performances here. He plays as one of the robbers and he has such a coolheaded, yet sociopathic nature, that I could not stop being disgusted and intrigued by his character. Jason Statham plays as his typical self, but he is much more serious than in other roles. Some of his facial expressions break his stoicness and those are the best parts for his performance and character. It shows that he is not just a lifeless robot in the film that he seems to be. A couple other standouts include Jeffrey Donovan as the leader of the robbers with his charisma, Holt McCallany as Bullet who was incredibly likable, DeObia Oparei who manages to make his character sympathetic with the little screen time he had and Andy Garcia. The cast is great in the film and they make these characters compelling.Storywise, it starts out kind of rocky, but it progressively gets better with each act and it leads to one of the most intense climaxes I have seen on the big screen. It seems like it is just going to be a cop action movie, but when more about the botched robbery is revealed, the twists make the movie more interesting. The pacing seemed confusing at first, but I quickly caught on to it. The movie places a lot of significance to the robbery at the opening of the movie. We see it in three different perspectives. One from the guards, one from Patrick Hill and one from the robbers. Each perspective is fresh and gives insight about the characters. The script is tight with no corners unturned except for a couple of minor details. I did not expect this movie to have as strong of a story as it did.Visually, the movie looks solid. There are some beautiful city shots and a couple impressive tracking shots. The color schemes are perfect for this kind of grimy aesthetic. The action scenes are not the strongest point in the film. They are pretty well-shot and there are some brutal parts, but the movie is more about the tension that builds up than the set pieces. However, the climax was awesome. It took many different turns and it was pretty unpredictable at times. Guy Ritchie's direction elevates the movie. He takes this simplistic concept of a film and he gives it the most dynamic pacing and editing possible. It is not straightforward, but it is never too confusing to the point where the movie loses me. The musical score is amazing. I found myself humming to the soundtrack to this film the whole way through and I still cannot get the tune out of my head.I have to say, Wrath of Man surprised me. I knew that going into the movie that there was a good chance that I would have a good time, but I did not anticipate being this invested. While it is not groundbreaking, it is an incredibly intriguing thriller that never stops being enjoyable. Maybe the first twenty minutes could have been better, but that is the only major complaint I have. If you feel the confidence to go to the movies and you are looking for a film that is ONLY in theaters, then this is one thriller worth checking out.",Wrath of Man
316,Deux_Vega,It's good,7,6 August 2021,"Not really your typical Guy Ritchie movie. It's not his trigger happy camera and smart lines style type of movie. This one builds up.

It has that somewhat raw look with the ""rob a bank"" feeling mixed in to it.It's played well, moves smooth, not nags or annoyances, everything just seems to all just perfectly well done. It's entertaining, there's action that doesn't feel as your generic action flick, so yes, kick-ass movie!I guess the negatives are that there are some boring parts within the storyline that drop just a tad to much in pace or interesting content, making me almost drop my eyes at one point. Surely also because of the good sound by the way. Also It doesn't manage to really hit the high levels of the dark knight, like the robbery scene.

It was nice to see Post Malone get out of the way early as someone stated he is not an actor. I don't even like his music, but it has an audience. Anyways, the movie isn't too bad, but definately convoluted. If a movie feels forced in multiple areas it is just really hard to give it that 7 or 8 or higher rating. I wanted to score it higher, as it had so much potential. I do like the action sequences, but the hot dog scene just felt so unnatural. Him getting his son to go there. Him ordering burrito's he normally never would. The timing of right when he ran up shots fired. I thought if they bring Stathom's character H back to life here it is roll of the eyes and 6/10.

It avoids the pitfalls of many action films of today that are plagued by shaky cams, CGI and fast editing - which are often done to mask the poor way in which the scenes are filmed. Wrath of Man doesn't suffer from this, as the basics (such as camera angles, stunt-men, pacing, etc) are done in a very good, text-book method.So yeah, definitely give this a watch.",Wrath of Man

In this movie you won't only see action but also a story also. Ritchie's direction is a bit different although his direction is based on Quantum Tarintino's style but it is different. This time you'// see a bit of a reality n some kind of disappointment (from Statham's fine).

Very deft directing and storytelling overall. A few bits which kind of pulled it down a bit, but overall a great bit of work. You might find the dialogue a bit show-offy, but I enjoyed it and found it entertaining.Richie's still got some great movies in him, and while this is comfortably in his crime / heist comfort zone, I'd really love to see Richie do something a bit different and more of a challenge for him, I like his work a lot.

Well, yes, but it's too convoluted and lost on character connections for that. Is it about greed? Well, yes, but it's too focused on the main character and his drama, but also without much of a backstory. Is it just about blood and shootouts? Certainly not, it's trying to be far more sophisticated than that.

However, I stuck with it and it actually turned into a pretty good movie. JS steals the show, yet his performance is very restrained. The plot is solid and builds with some surprises. My main criticism is that there's no moral compass at all to this movie. Sure, baddies can be the main protagonist of a film, but there's usually some kind of redemptive arc in their story. I just found it unsettling that the MC takes revenge for things he clearly does himself. In other words, everyone is evil in this movie, so who was I supposed to root for?

That's what this movie was about, the action.For an action movie the effects work, the story is decent, the writing could've used a bit more polish, and the choreography was on top of it. Yet this all worked together very well, the film just became a run that died out before it finished. I wasn't involved to the end, some of it was easy enough to see coming, but the action seemed a bit repetitive after a moment. I just felt while this may be a quality rental, it's not Statham's finest, nor his worst.

There was nothing that wanted me to like him or feel for him. He's a father and husband, but he felt cold even towards his own family. There wasn't enough development between him and his family to care. So you never become engaged in his character. I actually saw him as the actual bad guy. How does that even happen?",Wrath of Man

Clint Eastwoods kid has plenty of profile shots showing his similar appearance to dad. Jason this time is not the bullet proof kung fooa but still centre stage.

It managed without becoming cheesy like some other movies in the same genre. Didn't know Andy Garcia was in the movie, enjoyed seeing him again. Scott Eastwood did a good job too, the dude is a visual copy of his dad.Cons: I liked the story, but the storytelling could've been executed in a better, smarter way. It was over-explained as well, with especially one scene for example, showed in long flashbacks and from at least three different perspectives. The music, even though I liked it, was played too often which was a bit repetitive. Jason Statham tried too hard in a couple of scenes, overacting.Overall a decent, very close to a solid movie.6/10.",Wrath of Man

Don't understand why Statham's character needed to work at this ""Loomis"" place when he's got solid connection and could get the info he needed for his revenge from Andy Garcia character, instead of having his own crew kill off a bunch of potentials that got him nothing. Then again, it's Hollywood..so. The ending's a bit of a letdown since I wanted him to really work on Eastwood's character before killing him, rather than doing it quickly without so much as a groan and moan from his son's killer.

Think of shortened edition of Michel Mann's ""Heat"" rather than ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"", and you'll got some understanding of what it's all about.Jason Statham is perfectly fitting for the role of mysterious H., a character with dark past and blurred present. Again, it's not Statham typical B-movie action performance, since here thriller for the most part prevails over action. It's not entirely original work: Ritchie's film based on French Le Convoyeur (2004), but it's more of re-imagning than a direct copy or a straitforward remake.Starts like action-comedy, but then getting more and more dark, as new elements of the story introduced. At some moments plot is a bit hard to follow due to non-linear structure, but the basic points are always intact. Some subplots seems lost by the third act, and its preventing film from being great. However, for the most part it's a very soild, if unusual, effort from Ritchie entetring to a more mature ground.

He goes back to his roots. Doesnt speak much and does a lot of action.Story is decent with some good twists. It's not everyday you see the boss gets his hands dirty. That really hooked me into this flick.And the biggest surprise, it's directed by Guy Ritchie. I know what you're thinking. Yeah, it's the first film Ritchie made so dark. He specializes on action comedy, specially his signature sarcastic lines cross over on several character montages. Did the same thing here on just one or two occassion.

Also pretty impressive performance from Holt Mc Canally .The movie is a pretty grim heist/family loss and vengeance movie. The subplots are cleverly placed and the action fast paced. The result is a solid thriller with a nice vengeance ending. If you are a fan of Guy Ritchie and Statham work, this movie doesn't disappoint.",Wrath of Man

391,aaronclawrence,"Well made, but actually kinda boring",5,30 April 2021,"This is not your traditional Guy Ritchie movie with slick fast paced action, clever humour and lots of twists. Which I have loved in the past. It is basically a combination of heist movie and revenge thriller. But it's played very straight, without a lot of effort to build characters, and doesn't ever seem to build much momentum. So a few times during the movie I found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it was really going anywhere.The action is fairly tight but mainly gunplay, not much physical action as Statham is famous for.There are no heroes either, Stathams character seems to be a pretty nasty piece of work himself.All in all, it's an average thriller with nothing in particular to recommend it.",Wrath of Man

Our protagonist, or perhaps our anti-hero here, Jason Statham, as ""H"" does play his part very well and it's definitely one of his best movies ever. And it certainly up there with some of the best heist movies that you can probably think of in recent times. Furthermore, it goes to show yet again the true power and evil that lies within a man's heart once consumed by greed as the antagonists slowly and methodically come to realize-enough is never enough for them. All the actors in this film did excellent in their roles in fact. Seems to be a well written script that had some good thought put into it, and awesome action scenes await you!

I had almost given up on Jason Statham's movies, as they all felt the same... in different ways. It's like watching Vin Diesel movies... same stuff, different movie (minus Pitch Black and the original Fast and Furious).Also, he looks exactly the same as he did like 10 years ago... weird right?

I was expecting the flourishes of hand to hand combat, and all out beat the hell out of the bad guys. Turns out, it didn't really happen. Very slow and methodical. It was kind of predictable and routine. Not the action hero I've been used to. I like Jason, he's a solid actor, but the whole premise of the film was weak. I'm sure Guy Ritchie is fine director, but this one fell a little flat. Scott Eastwood too, was not, as he usually portrays, maybe they should have gotten someone else to play the ""rebel"" soldier. The back and forth on the plot was confusing as well, even though they told you they were 3 or 6 or 2 months earlier, it just didn't flow naturally. Maybe looking to draw the film out to it's. Full 1 hour and 58 minutes. Probably, could have been done 1 hour and 30 minutes. Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham have another collaboration coming out soon, hopefully, this one packs some punch and gets the message across.

It's a Jason Statham film. You know exactly what you're going to get: fights, bullets, cars, gangsters, one-liners and a complete disregard for the value of human life. There IS a revenge plot within, but it's perfunctory and in fairness it was 'H' who decided to leave his son in the car whilst out on a job. Also quite surprised by the low-energy, relaxed pace of some of the action scenes which are nothing like the intense, military precision of the crew depicted in Heat. When the bad guy is killed at the end, he reacts like he's having paint flicked at him, rather than being shot in one place at a time.

I don't really watch American movies too much anymore cause they're not as good anymore but I thought I'd watch this one. There was a few plot holes and the storyline was quite predictable. The main actors did decent but all the other actors were poor, and the lines and script was quite bad too. There wasn't really much to the characters and we don't really learn a lot about them or their past, background etc so I couldn't really get gripped into the characters of the film. The main actor who plays ""H"" had the same face throughout 90% of the film too. The way some of them delivered some of their lines made it really hard to take it serious. Also, the film jumps around a bit so it's difficult to keep up or understand parts. Quite a disappointment tbh! Also why is there like no security, no police cars or unmarked cars following them, just them 2 and millions of dollars...when they're moving so much money??

But when you learn, why he is on his mission, why H is, what he is, then you know, how its gonna end. So, its a construction that will end in a climax - or at least, I anticipated a much cleverer climax that what the movie shows us - which is, forgive me my opinion, just plain and flat and without creativity or the anticipated climax.

The money is hauled in soft bags and thrown in a sort of cage in the depot. What a nonsense, money transports are in sealed bags or suitcases and brought directly to the bank and deposited to the account of the client. But in this movie all money is thrown onto one big pile, which bag belongs to which customer? Who cares. The Black Friday heist starts with a room full of cash, then becomes 1 truckload, next scene enough for 2 quads and in the last scene it fits in the back of a prius. Honey who shrunk the money hey?

Like most of Ritchie's work, Wrath of Man acts as a puzzle, taking its time to develop and put itself together for the viewer, but as time goes on everything starts to connect, building up to a long-awaited finale that goes all out. I feel that the film could have been a bit better if some certain plot holes were addressed to a deeper level and if it's pace picked up a bit quicker, but overall viewers will get exactly what they want out of the film. There's just something about Jason Statham going to town unloading bullet clips that gets the people going.",Wrath of Man

492,Joshumms,"Disappointing, still decent.",6,17 October 2021,Wrath of Man is disappointing. It introduces an interesting plot with great music and cool camera shots but is never interesting or action packed enough to keep you from being bored. The first 30 minutes are enjoyable but then it goes into flashbacks for 45 minutes and introduces a completely different set of characters just to tie the story together. The flashbacks over complicate the story to the point that you lose interest. The flashbacks drag with the scenes lasting too long and not really adding much to the movie. In the last 30 minutes it all comes together with a climax that never really has enough tension and mediocre action sequences. I feel like this movie could've been better if it was just a fun stupid action thriller about cash trucks or telling the story without spending so long on a random group of characters and tedious flashbacks. I was very excited for this movie but Ritchie's direction really didn't serve the concept as well as I hoped.,Wrath of Man

501,Gentzen,Fails where Ritchie's past movies delivered,6,4 July 2021,"It's a good thing attempting to diverge from a successful but worn out recipe, as long as you get the novel elements right. Ritchie's other films (both with and without Statham) relied mainly on two things: snappy (often colloquial) dialogue, with plenty of innuendo, and unlikely coincidences that foil people's often ill-thought plans, landing them into near impossible situations. His plots were never about finely worked details that cohere into an elaborate big picture or deep character development.Here Ritchie attempted to deliver a revenge movie that was grimmer, slower burning and more ""serious"" in intent. Gone were the snappy, funny one-liners and the strokes of ""what can go wrong will go wrong"" turns of events. The sober and fairly impressive music motif underlined a more sinister twist in the plot and Statham's unsmiling, almost dour character was meant to be an unstoppable nemesis similar to killers in Fargo or No country for old men. His ambition sank, however, through an abundance of plot holes, weak character development and Statham's own one-dimensional acting. Statham is a good cast for action films with fast pace and lots of shootouts, but lacks what is required for deep, implied menace. Weak situational and character development meant one could not relate to either the villains (whose background as soldiers failed and cast aside by an ungrateful country, as well as family men struggling to provide for their loved ones might otherwise have made them more likeable and relatable) or the guards tragically betrayed by Bullet's character.Finally, the plot holes drove the last nail in the coffin. Statham went around asking his colleagues more questions than a PI, yet in a place where gossip would have spread like wildfire and where his character had already roused concern as a ""dark spirit"", nobody really became any the wiser or further suspicious about him (especially the inside man, Bullet). His connections with the FBI or the nature of his organization remained unexplained (though they occupied quite a bit of script space). On other occasions, it was hard to fathom why people acted the way they did: why did Eastwood's character return to his home after the botched out attack on the depot, rather than fleeing to an unknown address and change his identity? The police surely had plenty of corpses available to identify the team as a company of soldiers and seek out the missing link. Statham's character in fact sniffed his hideout faster than the cops in the final scene of revenge. The list is long.So, was that a bad movie? Depends on which angle one is coming from. As action scenes go, after the slow start, the film does not disappoint. Statham's cliched script parts (the reticent, low-key, self-confident punisher) are typically him. The movie is surely watchable on an uneventful weekend evening of relaxation. But, as the finished product, it is the kind of movie that does not require a Guy Ritchie to direct it. As a Guy Ritchie film, however, it is rather a flop that fails to lift off from the ground of other similar ""straight to video"" movies.",Wrath of Man

It feels a lot like an attempt to make HEAT without following the same template. It would have been great if they glued it together differently. After only watching it once I can fix it with a triple-twist.1) Show the ex-army team assembling and prepping for their first job. You get to know the gang, their motives, feelings, you get to understand and empathize with them.2) Job goes wrong. One of the gang is a psycho, war trauma or something. Kills 2 guards, a kid, some random dude whose face we don't even get to see.3) Cut to funeral for guards. They talk about what happened. They have to man up and get new recruits. Our protagonist shows up at job interview. Gets hired. We see the guards bond and get to know their characters, empathize with their lives and jobs and challenges. Get a few suspect characters to throw us off he scent.4) Second robbery happens. We learn this new guy is a badass as he totally defeats the heist. We get to know the guards more as he becomes cemented as a great guy in the company.5) Third robbery happens. For some reason the robbers abandon the hit. This is a different gang. We follow them for a while. We never get to see their boss, but they talk about his orders, what he wants, but not why. We get some back story about their past -the whole ""find out who did it"" search without knowing what they were trying to find. We keep thinking it's about 2 heist gangs against each other.7) Story unfolds from there.

This movie proves you can successfully have a diverse cast that doesn't seem forced.

The acting was decent, because it has a lot of good actors, but nothing exceptional. Same with every other aspect of the movie, except for the writing. Very rough. Statham's hand to hand skills were very underutilized and focused mostly on the characters shooting abilities, which had holes ;)pun intended.

But he practically plays the same character and has personality (or lack thereof) in every movie, just with different circumstances. Jeffrey Donovan and Holt McCallany are excellent as well, and honestly underrated actors. Watched Donovan in Let Him Go recently and he's barely recognizable in the best way.Wrath of Man is a balls-to-the-wall action flick that manages to skillfully include a decent plot and bare bones story to make you care just enough about these characters, but aside from Statham, just barely.The story jumped around quite a bit, which made it confusing at times, when all people want to do is watch the action flick this was intended to be.

Heist movies seem to be very similar to one another, but this take is a bit more fresh than the rest. It gives depth to both the protagonist and the antagonist which I think is a great mind game that a writer/director can play on the audience. My favorite part of the film is the darker toned score that plays behind a large majority of the scenes, adding a great amount of suspense. I know its a difficult thing to accomplish these days, but I would have given a higher score if it had a more of an original ending. Overall, its a great film that will keep you interested throughout its runtime.",Wrath of Man

It was pretty scaled back by his standards which was an interesting change of pace. It lacked a lot of the usual humor, though there is some. It's a bit grim but not too deep down that rabbit hole. I really liked the first half, seemed like I was well on my way to a surprise 8 star action/heist/gangster movie, but the 2nd half kind of tailed off in my opinion.Statham is Statham. The film had a good budget and was put together by professionals. Cool premise and promising characters gave way to a fairly standard shoot 'em up action-movie though. Not a bad movie for what it is though. I would probably give it a 6.5 if you could do half stars.",Wrath of Man

It's a mid-level action thriller. It mostly works although it insists on following the story from all sides which leaves the film at almost two hours. By grouping the different sides separately, they do feel a bit split especially the story of the robbers. I do wonder if the search for the inside man would be a more compelling path. Ritchie is trying for a tighter thriller than his usual. It's him slimmed down. He uses his action skills but this is not going to be considered one of his best or most inventive.",Wrath of Man

To be honest I haven't seen this one yet, just had a really interesting time reading opinions here.When you think about a Statham movie, what do you expect? A script honed and delivered like no other? The plot fascinating, building straight to the end with absolutely no holes? Totally believable characters who are fleshed out and vetted? A hero who stands above the rest? Naaaahhhhh........ You expect a moody, quiet, flawed man who has a snarky attitude and somehow gets pushed into letting out his impossibly well-trained side. You want to see a ""whoopin'."" Guns firing, bones breaking, justice measured out way over the ""full"" mark. All done by one of the guys at work, or who lives down the street.Are you hoping to find classic literature, multiple Oscar categories, an ending which ties everything up neatly with a bow and sends you home in bunny slippers and a case of the warm fuzzies? Jason is a smart man. He knows what his fans want and always delivers. Most of us have inner demons hiding. It can be refreshing to see someone else let theirs loose for a good cause.

The Guy Ritchie style of this film is so sleek, dark, and suave, and I can't get enough of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the different perspectives utilized in the storytelling and how it all came in full effect. Jason Statham played a character that he could easily portray, while not having to push any boundaries. The mystery behind his character wasn't really explored but the obscurity behind it was enticing. I wish there was some more hand to hand combat, but I'm all for trading it in for moments where he's just radiating pure badass energy.

Neverunderestimate the love and power of a father who will bring the house down and rain evil on man lest you taketh away his son!It had everything and I even felt it gave some homage to Den of Thieves-style o' heist genre.

586,scarfin-06111,"Robbers beware because ""H"" is watching you.",8,17 October 2021,"Wrath Of Man is the fourth movie that Jason Stratham and Guy Ritchie has done together in the past 23 years. 1998 was their first movie called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.They followed this one up with Snatch in 2000 and Revolver in 2005.These two together is now known as the dream team and any movie they do together is considered money in the bank for any movie production company in Hollywood.Jason Stratham alone is a guaranteed money maker at the box office and his numbers have proven it. Just in ticket sales alone, Jason's movies have generated over 1.5 Billion Dollars, and because of this, he is one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood.Wrath of Man is no different since they have once again provided viewers with another movie with bloody scenes, plenty of action and Jason doing what he does best - kicking people's asses.Watching this movie, one can certainly see the comparison to the French film Cash Truck which unfortunately was not seen by as many people that will be seeing Wrath of Man.What I found difficult is trying to follow along with some scenes to determine if what is happening on screen is in the past, present or future, especially if just a little distracted. It could be just me and I realize it is exactly how Ritchie wanted the movie to be just to keep everyone engaged which is why his writing and directing skill set is so well respected.Also respected for his performance in this movie is Scott Eastwood. Everyone know him as the son of icon Clint Eastwood but Scott really demonstrated in this movie that he doesn't need his father's fame to prove he is a damn good actor on his own.I am not going to go into any plot details because it serves no purpose since people should really watch the movie to fully understand what the movie is really about.It is very difficult to describe the plot of a movie that has been divided into four separate parts that encompasses one main centre piece creating multiple chain reactions.Just know by watching this movie without being distracted, you will be taken on a thrill ride that only Jason Stratham and Guy Ritchie have prepared for you. There is plenty of action and storylines for you to follow until the final frame, then and only then will you understand what it feels like to be hit by the Wrath Of Man.",Wrath of Man

Look I get it with Jason's loss we are meant feel for him. Think like yeah he can be hurt too. But yeah nah. Main protagonist is still perfect.

It sounds a bit like it was written by a 13 year old and Statham is generally unintelligible.The plot is okay but kind of feels like they took two films and just mashed them together. One is a half baked Payback style revenge flick which Statham delivers okay in his usual way. The other is a more interesting Heat style heist flick which Jeffery Donovan delivers well. But they're two completely different films with little to connect them.To be fair. If you took the revenge flick out and just left the heist film with Andy Garcia chasing Jeffery Donovan and Scott Eastwood then you'd probably have a really good film!If it's raining outside and you've watched everything you want to see, read all the books you want to read and played all the games you want to play them maybe watch this.

596,cruelworldfilms,"Good, just not great.",7,29 May 2021,"I'm a big time Guy Ritchie fan who's so glad he's back to directing more adult-oriented fare, e.g. ""The Gentlemen"", after his hit (""Aladdin"") and miss (""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword""), family-friendly efforts.""Wrath of Man"" is a decent action-thriller, if a bit on the long side, which is only more noticeable given its non-linear narrative. That said, Jason Statham's performance is, I think, a career best-- never more badass, and would have the likes of John Wick wearing their brown pants. Likewise, Josh Hartnett is pretty good, especially during the 1st stick-up, but is hardly in it for the most part.It's also refreshing to see a real dark-grittiness in film as nowadays everything's sanitised and sterilised or made to look pretty and colourful for mass consumption.However, without giving anything away, the ending kinda let's things down (you may get what I mean if/when you get there), but overall ""Wrath of Man"" is never a dull moment (imagine somewhere between ""Man on Fire"" and ""Revolver"").

Masculine joyride.Con's : It's absolutely ridiculous, the range of the actors in this film is laughable like the Departed if the characters had zero personality. It's almost like they were instructed to be completely stone faced on set. The opening acts sequence of events makes less sense than Fight Clubs unreliable narrator & he was a Schizophrenic. Everyone's constantly walking around with perfect suits on even after engaging in gratuitous murder/violence. Maintaining suspension of disbelief is so difficult, even for the sake of the action that it almost seems like a satire of a Gangster film. It's Den of Thieves if there's zero realism whatsoever.Bottom-line, watch John Wick. Actions just as good plot/actings better.",Wrath of Man

So the protagonist is a mob boss, he leads a series of money cars' hijacks, yet he gives money for free for people he frees after interrogation!He has a strong ties with the FBI, so that their informant gives him a list of people names to track down, yet those names leads nowhere. Yet we see the same guy shows up and the end of the movie and says ""are we done?"", done of what?! You didn't do anything! The only thing the agency did was changing Mr. H's identity! Done with overlooking the crimes they've done? So if the FBI overlooked, where's is the police? Is the FBI the only law force in the US and it's controlled entirely by this guy? Don't know!The protagonist was shot three times in the course of the movie, the first one, he got 6 bullets, which the hospital's doctor removed, the next one was at the deposit, he got one bullet directly, from a very close distance, to his knee, yet our hero still manages to walk like he's got a simple ankle twist, and the third one was from a close distance too, but this time form an automatic gun! Countless bullets were shot at him and fell down, yet wee see him at the finale doesn't bother with no scratches, but still have this ""knee bullet"" ankle twist walk!The acting was good, all the cast delivered good performance, except for Mr. H! Like why on earth does he have to keep this cold looking, ""cold as a reptile"", senseless postures all the time?! Really why! Because he lost his son in a gun shot? But he was already expressing the same cold attitude from the beginning, from the moment he picked up his son from his high-school/university/library/whatever. Like why on earth would a man never smiles? And doesn't exhibit any kind of feelings? Because he's a soldier (although not mentioned), but we see the main antagonist (the sergeant) smiles and have family parties, or because he went through a divorce? We see most of the antagonist's not married yet they're full of energy and you can see that in their eyes, not zombies like Mr. H!After the main heist took place, is it really possible to exit the deposit with only one armored car and drive it for at least on kilometer, without the police have their fences and checkpoints surrounding the whole place? Don't know!The direction was good, you'd enjoy the events reveal one by one, everything seems real except those events that I mentioned earlier, and the cast did well too, except Mr. H of course with his cold persona. There's no depth to this story, maybe a thought of how we should take care of our veterans after their return from war zones and provide them with decent jobs that would fulfill their needs and related to their skills, and, don't ever involve your family in your work, you must keep a huge distance between the two, or you'll end up divorced with a dead son.The dialogues in this movie was bad as hell, ""Afghani are not Arabs"" really? Hallelujah! I was expecting all people live outside the US are Arabs, thanks for enlightening me! And the hustle and bustle with Mr. H coworkers at the security company, what was that for? To show that Mr. H is a badass, and? That's it.

This movie is about a man and his wrath. Hill (Jason Statham) joins a company which handles transferring and securing money for some of the big organisations such as Casinos and rich people, to find the culprit helping people to rob these tanks from the inside. The story is packed with extreme action and mind blowing story.Now let's talk about how I felt watching this movie. Should you watch this movie? Hell yeah. This is an amazing crime thriller whose direction was astonishing and I couldn't help but appreciate the beauty of some innovative scenes. I mean, the story was splendid, the action sequence was also good and the acting of such an incredible crew was something that hooked me till the end.The mystery suspense in the movie made it a masterpiece, and it kinda gave me the Godfather vibe (although I haven't watched that movie, but still). Jason Statham and his skills enchanted this movie with amazement, which elevated this movie's overall score.To summarise, an amazing action movie.

Could have just laid out Statham's motivations from the beginning, which would increase tension by giving the viewer some reason to care if he dies, and save a half hour of runtime.

There are zero similarities. What you do get is a hodge podge heist/revenge action movie that is so boring we almost walked out.The opening scene was pretty much lifted straight from Heat but from the security guards side. It even looked like the same bridge. One dimensional stereotyped characters who are completely unrelatable and unbelievable. Very corny dialogue and a lot of wasted talent from the actors available. Apart from Scott Eastwood who looks like he's never held a weapon before and is completely lost. Easily Guy Ritchies worst film.,Wrath of Man

Okey there was plot holes, yes but as for the pandemic era of bad movies and TV shows on 2021 this movie was a bandeage for boredom.

I mean there are not really much fighting, but the score really fantastic and some jokes are funny enough. Jason Statham and Scott Eastwood performances are really great however the rest was kinda meh. A little bit twist are enjoyable. Theres some plot holes but it was acceptable.

708,nekkidnorman,Pretty much every aspect is terrible,3,17 July 2021,"Opening scene: 2 men in a truck talking (one that really isn't even shown) and yet their ""acting"" is horrid. Since they're not really shown, they don't even have to act, they just have to recite their lines and yet even that is below amateurish. The performances in a typical 5th grade school play is Oscar worthy compared to the acting in this movie. I don't know who those 2 people are related to, or what sort of blackmail material they have on the powers-that-be, but they certainly didn't get their roles because of talent.Statham's deadpan delivery is not even good by his low standards, but everyone else is MUCH worse.Then there's the plot. Just a rehash of past heist films with no originality and every ""twist"" is poorly conceived and horribly done. The editing isn't great and I'd wouldn't be surprised if you took the scraps off the cutting room floor and put them together, you'd end up with a better plot (though still the terrible acting).Finally, there's the music by Chris Benstead... it's like the budget only allowed for one track (and a bad one at that) and then the same grating, repetitive, noise is just repeated consistently throughout the movie. Seriously. The opening scene = Song #1. Opening credits = Song #1. A scene that's supposed to be full of tension = Song #1. A scene attempting to fill in the backstory = Song #1. Chase scene = Song #1. Sad scene = Song #1. Post-coital scene = Song #1. Shootout = Song #1. Heist = Song #1. End credits = Song #1. With a movie runtime of 118 minutes Song #1 was played for what felt like 283 minutes (but really was probably only played for a paltry 97 minutes total - Chris must have copies of the incriminating photos to get such a mediocre, monotone, song played non-stop throughout pretty much the entire movie.)With all the money saved reusing the same crap song for the full runtime, and what I can only assume were unpaid ""actors"", you'd think someone would spent some time/money on better editing, re-shoots, and general quality control - but nope.Dreadful film.I've seen >1000 films in my life and while this may not be the worst I've ever sat through, off the top of my head I don't recall any that were worse.Watch something at least entertaining like The Town, Den of Thieves, The Bank Job, or the stellar and infinitely better Inside Man. Or a top tier classic like Heat or The Usual Suspects. Even a popcorn flick like The Italian Job, 2Guns, Point Break, Ocean's Eleven, or any of hundred's of other similar movies is time better spent than watching this dreck.",Wrath of Man

After defying death Statham makes it his only goal in life to kill his son's murderer. After having no luck tracking them down and seeing the carnage he leaves behind in his wake he decided to change his identity and find employment as a security guard for the said cash truck company to get more intel.From the outset you you feel that this is going to be a slow burner as you learn about the world of the cash truck business.The scenes are shot masterfully. Through different perspectives the movie gives you background information in a non-chronological manner, that enhances the experience of solving the murder alongside Statham.The soundtrack must be the unsung hero in this movie. It is used effectively to bring out the emotion a particular scene carries The movie lacks that fast paced comical dialogue from previous Guy Ritchie films. Less dialogue meant more attention was payed to the details of each shot.

If you watch the film you will enjoy the first two acts a lot and it will build up a big expectation for the end, but unfortunately it may not match with your expectation.

741,Faraday32,Could have been so much better,5,22 September 2021,"Huge fan of Guy Ritchie films and this one started off well. A decent plot and good acting from a mix of UK/US cast. All was well up until the end. Having already survived multiple bullet wounds at the beginning (for which he needed to have three major operations), our action man Jason Statham is once again peppered with bullets - this time from close range - by a machine gun near the end of the film. Usually we assume the main character is not dead, however I genuinely believed that after having so many bullets tear into his body it was curtains for him. Alas he manages not only to somehow survive but also track down the robber. Any normal person would have either died or at least needed further major operations as well as rehab. Our hero not only avoids hospital but also manages to hop, skip and jump to the robber's apartment presumably on the same or next day (can't imagine any serious robber hanging out in his apartment with $150m for more than a couple of days after a heist).Both the film and viewers deserve a much better ending. It's as if Ritchie was running out of time and jut needed an ending. To be fair I have not read the book on which the film is based, therefore I am not sure if this was the original ending. If that is the case then I can only apologise to Guy (though I am sure he doesn't read these anyway). Either way it was huge disappointment to have such an unrealistic ending.",Wrath of Man

Has Covid robbed him of his artistic flair? It lacks the style, wit, and charm that have been so prevalent in his work. I even enjoyed his worst-reviewed movie (Revolver) more than this; at least it had some personality and visual appeal to it. This is more cold, monotone, derivative. It's like John Wick, but with a brighter image and less creativity. If it was an effort from a first time director, it would be more impressive. The characters are flat and cliched, even their nicknames are lame (seriously, I cringe at how stupid ""Boy Sweat"" sounds).It's hard not to compare a filmmaker's movies to his previous work. But this is just not as fun as his other films. Without giving anything away, the ending is bleak and unsatisfying. I've watched most Ritchie movies multiple times, but I have no desire to ever see this again. It's not the worst film ever, it's just uninspired and bland.",Wrath of Man

Again, solid cast, I would have rated it a 6.6/10; however, this scoring on IMDB is not an option (and the film is not a 7/10).

The trailer showed a good bit of what you can expect, jut then as the film unfolds it gets darker, more violent & brutal. I ended up liking this film quite a bit. Excellent cast, Jason Statham is good as usual, but the added intensity made it even better (in my opinion). It was also great to see Josh Hartnett again, even if I wish they utilized him more. & Scott Eastwood surprised me, he was good as well. The plot had some interesting twists & did a good job of making me think it was going one way, but then doing something different & pulled it off well. It feels a bit mainstream for Guy Ritchie, but you can pick up on some fun, witty dialog here & there. I would say it's an action thriller, a cross between a revenge flick & a heist film.

Guy Ritchie goes for a darker tone, and constructs the movie in a non-linear, segmented way. This keeps you guessing, and adds to the thrilling nature of what ends up being an exciting heist movie.The first act moves with an undeniable forward momentum, thanks in no small part to the ominous score - from there the editing and story structure can be a bit confusing, even after the credits roll. Ritchie tells us a story from the perspective of different groups, and reveals information slowly, but doesn't stick the landing smoothly.Statham gives another great performance, with his character operating in a moral grey-area, solving problems with his brain as much as his brawn.

It's not a template that you just wait to see complete itself. It's a seriously told story.Jason Statham proved that he can act. He's not just there to beat up extras and smirk.Many film stories try to tell tales with protagonists and antagonists that move the plot with strong will.This one does it way better than most.Nothing's superficial, let alone redundant.The directing's immaculate. Straight to the point. When it's slow - it feels right. When it's fast paced - again... it's organic and mindful. It's there to tell the story, as good directing does.The writing's top notch.As is the acting.It keeps you interested. It doesn't feel like it has fillers.

Le Convoyeur (Cash Truck) 2004 (french movie starring François Berléand, Statham's partner in Transporter series) was not great but probably deserved the 6.5 stars. This copycat is close to awful. Gave it 3 stars for the effort of the secondary leads that were credible enough.Statham's acting is over the top, probably the Fun and not so furious franchise took it's toll.Soundtrack is repetitive and annoying, camera pans are less than decent, CGI is comparable to 1995-2000 shooter games. Probably Ritchie discovered Max Payne after 30 years, he even used the famous ""bullet time."" Flashbacks are overabondant and at least half are not necessary in order to follow the ""plot""., thanks to them I understood several times in a row what is actually happening, why, and why not. Thanks, my IQ is way below 70 and I really needed it!Timing sequence is not cohesive, cuts were put together in a rush, leaving even more cringier discordances than the famous 6 underground. Examples: 7 people allegedly riding 2 quads, a very oxidated silver prius that looks black, armoured truck parked in one place, retrieved a few meters further.Huge dissappointment, a failed commercial movie that tries unsuccessfully to add depth to the main character.

The dark heavy soundtrack is perfect. Acting pleasantly surprised me. All the supporting actors were great. And Stathams work in this movie made me appreciate him as an actor.

There were a number of scenes that didn't need to be included at all - for example the scene in Danas apartment and the whole second heist he was caught up in as H where he was seen by his former workers - they added zero to the story and were never mentioned again so seemed pointless. With 5 minutes to go I was sure there was going to be a big twist coming due to the unfinished storylines, but nope, it just finished. I know this is film is an adaptation so that might explain it but this lacked Guy Richie's usual magic of weaving different storylines together to a big conclusion.

Jason, I don't blame you for this and you tried your money-making-best. How did you end up in this film... owe too much to a loan shark and need some easy coin? Nevertheless, I wish I got my time back, but probably not as badly as everyone involved in this slowly evolving nap-inducer wishes they got theirs back.

Extremely disappointing and I'd say certainly brand-weakening.As for Ritchie, with such a blatantly thin premise and choppy screenplay for a movie, what can you really do? Nothing much apparently.Honestly, my 19-year-old nephew could have done a better job.Finally, as for Statham, this is the difference with a Tom Cruise, a Keanu Reeves and other action actors of their stature. They generally always deliver high-quality entertainment and don't sign up for the short money or tagging a film with their name just for extra box office or appearing in 4-5 skimpy cookie-cutter movies a year as they understand the true value of their brand.",Wrath of Man

Stoic from start to finish, Statham continues to impress me with just how little emotion he showed. Wether it was in the face of a robbery, during a sexy interrogation or finding out about the loss of loved ones, Jason's emotional meter never goes past .5. And that is on a scale to 100.He's not for the chit chat, he doesn't want to be your friend. He wants those responsible to pay and he makes sure they do without batting an eye. Which I like in my armored truck security guards.The backstories are superb and almost all the characters you feel like you can root for.

969,oleglvov-27199,Much blood about nothing,1,9 May 2021,"Just saw this in a theatre. Here is the deal:1) Statham says very little. He still has great physique-and his character does nothing with it throughout the film. Instead, the character shoots anywhere between 10 and 20 people with a face expression rivaling Dirty Harry. Dirty Harry had a human side. This gun nut apparently loses it after his tragedy. It's a major waste of Statham if you give him a big gun and ask to shoot, shoot, shoot. Just once he uses his physique-once. You feel more empathy for Jeffrey Donovan because of the script. And JD is a baddie.2) There is a ""morality tale"" inside the movie. Like, robbers hate girl abusers and punish them cruelly. If you watched the Gentlemen, a curious drug related morality tale was also inserted into the movie. These morality tales feel very out of place in a criminal caper. At least the gentlemen was funny-nothing is funny about this film. The banter they have in the beginning about this or that bird is crude and not even locker room talk level.3) If I watch a cops/robbers film, i expect some kind of a plot and a plot twist. This runs for two hours without plot twists. Zero. The biggest baddie is not even hiding. The guy who looks like he can betray betrays. Assault on Precinct 13 has more suspense than this thing, predictable to the max.4) Americans love technology. They put videocameras inside door rings, and install home security systems. Any building with semi-valuable stuff is bound to have lots of locks, silent buttons, fingerprint scans and protocols. USA is not Brazil, people follow procedures. The establishment in the film has security at the level of a near bankrupt grocery store warehouse.5) Last not least, a viewer has to feel something for a protagonist if the movie is good. Lefty in Donnie Brasco is not a ""good person"", but fuhgedaboutit! You can sense him. In this 2-hour drivel every person on screen is a stupid and cruel psycho. Except maybe a girl guard-but she is not given room to develop. Most others have no redeeming qualities.Boy, how the mighty have fallen. Statham probably says more in 5 minutes of Snatch than in this entire film. Oh-and this wrath of man does not have humor or comic relief. At all.",Wrath of Man

973,kryptonnavigatr,Unfocused & Unsatisfying,4,13 May 2021,"Be warned, some spoilers ahead.So, you've got your typical Guy Ritchie ""kerfuffle"", a crime mystery flick with plenty of moving parts, that's also a Jason Statham vehicle.The main issue is that, unlike previous films of his, where he writes his characters into a corner, in which they need to find their own way out, the plot of Wrath of Man is full of convenience that favours either the protagonist or antagonist.On top of this, the non-linear storytelling drags a lot.The director is known for his fantastic montages, which take the information, emotions and action he wants to convey, and stylishly condenses it into an action packed sequence.Here, instead of conveying information in his flamboyant style, it's simply shots that already plainly convey the information we need to know, and then cut to another scene with a character blandly spelling it out.The title cards of ""Three months later"" and ""6 weeks earlier"" etc. Feel super unnecessary, and the timeline of events is clearly conveyed, but for some reason we still need not only visual confirmation, but a character to spew veiled exposition to ensure you are aware that we've jumped in the timeline.On this, the ""chaptered title cards"" feel out of place. The movie is obviously going for some sort of biblical/theatrical themes of revenge, but it keeps trying to slam us over the head with it instead of letting the plot speak for itself. Even so, the themes don't really end up saying anything for themselves, these grandiose statements in tone end up feeling disconnected to the play by numbers action we end up getting.And let's talk about the dialogue. The whole first act is a bunch of robotic sounding ""locker room"" talk, followed by a second act of ""I'm a gruff criminal doncha know"" talk, and a third act of over explanatory ""military strategy"" talk.Speaking of military strategy, everything in the final action sequence is conveniently set up to solve problems haven't even run into yet.Statham needs protection, so he murders a man twice his size and takes a suit of armour, which conveniently fits him.If the group of evil robber's have a plan so airtight with the hope they all make it out alive, how come each step of the plan conveniently has less and less vehicles/weapons & ammunition that happens to be just the right amount you'd need for the few that survived?And don't even get me started on all the loose threads left hanging, that only existed in the first place to justify certain plot beats.Statham's illegal plan is supported by the FBI. How and why can he get away with that? Doesn't matter, it only exists to explain why other characters aren't asking more questions.How do the antagonists suddenly take such a big leap forward in their ambitions and capabilities? Doesn't matter, we need them to eventually cross paths with Jason Statham again.It's frustrating, because at the end of the day, some great actors can't carry the weak dialogue with their pretty good performances.Guy Ritchie's iconic style of filmmaking can't amplify any of the interesting concepts the film keeps threatening to, but ultimately never tackles.And even God himself couldn't carry Wrath of Man's limp execution into something worth spending two hours watching.",Wrath of Man

986,vypersoldier,Patience is key,9,30 May 2021,Just watched this film and I am amazed. The plot of the story is very good but it takes a while to get there. Throughout the first quarter of the movie you are kind of lost since the information is not spoonfed to you. You have to pay attention carefully. After a while you learn what the movie is about and this brings about one of the first issues. The movie switches back and forth and back again then back to present time but at different points (if that makes any sense). I was kind of lost after a while because of all the switching of the settings to tell the story. I think it could have been executed differently but I'm no movie director. This complaint of mine brought it down by one point but could've deserved more. Other than that if you pay attention carefully throughout the film you start to put pieces together that Ritchie leaves out in front of you. I really like this way of story telling because it feels more immersive. Lastly I was a bit disappointed to not see Jason Statham have his usual approach to movies like this by killing everyone he sees in sight. There are some plot twists in here and like I said earlier if you pay attention you will figure out what is going on. Other than that it's a great movie and totally worth the time and money.,Wrath of Man

Then his security partner who has seen how badass Jason is confesses to him that he is in on the heists somehow not realizing he is the guy hunting the robbers. Then tells him a kid was unfortunately killed which is of course Jason's. Why did he need to tell Jason any of this? Then all the long drawn out back and forth time sequences that are incrediblly boring filled with characters with no back story and don't care about.

You can't be both it made me feel this could have been two different films.Jason Statham lost an improv opportunity...when he's stood in in a room, with his back to who he's questioning I would have liked to see him have gone absolutely SICK. Something like ""You think you've done everything?.....find him....(deep breath). Find HIM...(deeper breath)......(agitated....) FIND HIIIIIMMM!!!Jason then proceed to smash up the room, it's his son after all.The plot seemed loose in places. Roughly from after the producer literally sucks Jason's man balls in the ""you're a hero"" but after the first successful defence.Look at TRUE great films like HEAT. Show the vulnerability of the character early. If you make him out to be harder than his you lose credibility. Serious and determined yes, poos bullets out at breakfast NO.This could have been a great film but it's like the American actors only took it serious half way through filming.I feel Guy Ritchie has been let down by the actors a little.Had they realised they were in the hands of a true great director earlier than they had, this film had the potential to be a 10.",Wrath of Man

Guy Ritchie has tried to do that by presenting a tough and brutal movie with Statham. But Ritchie wouldn't be himself if he didn't decide to add his trademark nonlinear storyline and mix different times in the narrative, plus dividing the film into several chapters, each of which was about specific people who eventually ended up being connected by their relationship to Fertico, where the main character got a job.I think this film is atypical of Ritchie in the first place, because even in 'King Arthur's Sword' he finds room for banter, whereas here it's pure brutal and a lot of shotgun shells. And nothing more.In fact, this film aims solely at entertaining the audience, and therefore Guy Ritchie's trademark style here recedes into the background, giving way to just the action.

1010,d-65517,Better not be angry,10,19 June 2021,"The new film ""Wrath of Man"" (Wrath of Man) has been released in cinemas. It was shot by Guy Ritchie. The credits indicate that this is a remake of the French film ""Collector"" (Le Convoyeur) in 2004, but in fact the British director completely reworked the script. Only the basic plot has been preserved - this is a story about robberies of collector cars.A brutal man, played by Statham, gets a job as a collector in a private office, where he is given the nickname H (H). H looks like a decent man - he first worked in Europe, and now moved to America. There is no family, I am ready to give everything at work.But some of his colleagues are beginning to think that H is not who he claims to be, that his biography is a fake, and that he is a muddy type. And I must say that H gives rise to suspicion - it is too nice to repel the attacks of criminals.Before going to the session, I watched the French ""Le Convoyeur"", but in fact, there was no point in it. ""Collector"" is not a bad movie, but it is shot in a completely different manner than the Guy Ritchie film, and with different accents.Those who expect from"" The Wrath of Man ""an author's movie in the spirit of ""Gentlemen"" or ""Cards, money, two guns"" may be disappointed. This is more of a classic action movie with a slightly hackneyed plot. But Guy Ritchie is not only the director of the film ""Big Jackpot"", but also"" Aladdin ""and"" Sherlock Holmes "" - films aimed at a wider audience.""Human Wrath"" is built in a non-linear way - the director sends us back to the past, then back to the present. Moreover, at some point, the hero of Statham fades into the background, and Scott Eastwood, the son of Clint Eastwood, comes to the fore.The trick is that the story is told from several sides at once. First we see the incident with one eye, and then with the other. It's well thought out - a significant part of the film is devoted to deepening the story, adding details to it, and personally motivating the characters.Statham here plays a man who is stingy with emotions, who can express everything he feels just by looking at his enemy. I must say, he plays such a role in many other films.The film is shot in a dark scale, as if we see the events through a filter, where the colors are muted. Statham's face often remains in the shadows - a trick designed to emphasize the mystery of his character.Los Angeles is shown here in a slightly depressing way, this is emphasized by the long melody on the cello, which will follow the viewer throughout the film.What happened in the end? It turned out to be a good action movie with a touch of psychology, perfectly played and filmed.Due to the dynamic editing, this film looks easier than the French one, so you can safely skip "" Le Convoyer ""and immediately proceed to Statham's"" Wrath"". And believe me, he knows how to be angry.",Wrath of Man
1011,y-94804,Crime. Classic. Poetry.,10,19 June 2021,"It is a rare case when Jason Statham holds the attention of the audience throughout the film, while not waving his arms or legs. True, it shoots well.THE NEGATIVE part of the REVIEW. Aesthetic characters after watching the film will immediately begin to 'suffer': 'why would a master and genius (Guy Ritchie) decide to embark on orthodox action seas? It's boring, it doesn't make any new discoveries, it doesn't give you the feeling of an art house or surprise.'And fans of the unencumbered action genre will remember the French film 'Collector'(2004) and even make claims about the excessive balancing between everyday life, psychology and action scenes in 'Anger'.After all, this is not a 'pure action movie'. There are mysteries and questions here that eager viewers will want direct and immediate answers to. Why did the hero get a job as a collector? What kind of special services are watching him? Who robs the collection cars and why do they kill the guards? Waiting for easy answers for a long time can tire some of the audience.Where are the jokes? Or at least some 'perversions'? There is no such thing in the film. It's too serious. Only domestic men's jokes. You can hear them better in the original language. In Russian dubbing, their flow disappears.So, the main controversial statements of the film: money is not the main thing, do not trust anyone, any stupid and independent event can throw your life in the trash. Are such things popular among ordinary people?THE POSITIVE part of the REVIEW. Simple country jock Jason once made Guy popular. Or vice versa: Guy launched the English village in the person of Jason into the world orbit? Through the twisted criminal London of the late 90s. And now, twenty years later, just like the Musketeers, they have met again and are working on a new round of their careers.What did this film become? By repeating what you've done? A nostalgic poem about long-lived emotions? Neophytes may not understand. In fact, Statham in ""The Wrath of Man"" has a collective image of many action movie heroes of the 90s.How to talk more about this movie without spoilers? It only needs to be watched. Without raising expectations. Let the attitude be: 'Well, another opus from Ritchie and Statham.' Then you will see that 'not another one'. And there is no need to discuss the skill of the director. In this case, it is taken for granted.What's interesting: right now, Richie and Statham are busy shooting a new thriller. They say that one of the locations is the Emirates. On espionage topics.THE VERDICT: Classic of the genre.",Wrath of Man
1012,n-36628,Jason Statham Doesn'T Change his Profession,10,19 June 2021,"Jason Statham - aka Statham) is an amazing person. The actor has 56 roles in the filmography and 90 percent of them are, frankly, well ... similar to each other. And all the same, everyone loves him, they call him to act and something I did not hear any special complaints, ala ""Statem is the same and everyone got it, let's get someone else"". In general, Jason Statham is not one of those people who says and does one thing today and another tomorrow...He does not change himself in the new action movie from the incomparable Guy Ritchie. The main character of ""The Wrath of Man"" is still the same mechanic/carrier/parker in one bottle. Well, that's all right. Does he come in? Coming in!Guy Ritchie gives another good action movie in his style. About gangsters, revenge, criminal squabbles, and the like. The main character, nicknamed H, may be a good guy, and in general, he would not have participated in all this madness, if not for the personal drama. She encouraged the main character to show his enemies, and at the same time the viewer, what real ""human anger""is. Statham does it. With a stony face, he breaks up his abusers left and right, and from the very first minutes of the film, you can guess who is who. In general, a classic action movie, with a predictable ending.But damn, it's delicious! It's all because of old Guy Ritchie. I've always said that the thing about his films is their incredible style and frenzied dynamics. You just sat down to watch, and you won't get up until the movie is over. And your sense of beauty will choke with delight. The aesthetics are so hot, starting with the awesome opening credits. Well, where without British humor - which is sometimes on the verge of stupidity, but the line is not crossed! Not once! So it's very hilarious.What is remarkable about this film is the excessive amount of violence. Yes, get your kids off the screen. Here you have shots at point-blank range, and brains out, and torture, and all that. A little harsh against the background of the latest ""Gentlemen"". And I don't say anything about Aladdin at all...I really liked the accompanying sound. The intense five-note music throughout the film should have been exhausting. But the effect is the opposite, it spurs all the actions of the characters, adding pepper to them.Oh, that's it. What is there to say? Not Ritchie's best film, but as always beautiful.",Wrath of Man
1013,x-67883,Unexpectedly strong,10,19 June 2021,"In the life of a film fan, it sometimes happens that you want to go to the cinema, but in the rental grid it's like a mouse has hanged itself. And then you go to a movie that you would otherwise have missed, but that's the only thing that seems at least more or less decent in the movie theater schedule. Such a film for me was ""The Wrath of Man"". I was convinced to go to it by two names - Jason Statham and Guy Ritchie.Everyone has long known that Jason Statham has been an actor of his own genre for many years - a tooth-crushing brutal action that does not shine with a masterpiece, but well brightens up a couple of hours of free time. And Guy Ritchie doesn't need an introduction. To be honest, I didn't even watch the trailer and went to the movie in the belief that I was going to check out a strong representative of the category B fighters.""Anger"" was divided into several chapters. And the introduction almost disappointed me - it was the same 'B-movie' in its most banal form. And this is the work of the director of 'Sherlock Holmes' and the recent 'Gentlemen'? Seriously? Only with the end of the first chapter comes the second-and I can not tear myself away from what is happening.Unexpectedly, I find myself witnessing the unfolding drama. Let it be banal, let it be secondary, but shown so emotionally and vividly that you do not feel any complaints about it. And Jason Statham finds himself inside a strong dramatic image, which is extremely atypical for this actor. Before us is a very deep character with a powerful drama inside, which you empathize with with all your might. He has a strong motivation and you sympathize with his goals.The third chapter unexpectedly reveals those whom the protagonist is looking for. This is also unexpected, because we are exposed to the same episode from completely different sides. It's not often that you see villains treated by the plot as the same people who do what they do for a reason. Once again, the question arises: who is the main villain-the people or the society that creates them?The characters are generally a separate respect of the film. Despite the small timekeeping and not the most detailed study of them, they seem to be alive and real. Therefore, the final act, in which all the heavenly taps are opened, escalates the tension to the highest point. You worry about each favorite hero, because you understand that they are not going to spare anyone. Just like Statham - their potential enemies.At the beginning of the end credits, I felt devastated, mixed with despair. So the film emotionally 'gutted'me.""The Wrath of Man"" broke my assumptions, giving out a one-time, but very powerful film, which turned out to be interesting from a visual and narrative point of view. The intricacies of the non-linear narrative allowed you to fully immerse yourself in the process. The action turned out to be spectacular enough to dilute the dialogues and actions. In the end, I got a lot more than I wanted, which I don't regret.",Wrath of Man

It's all around us.The main character (H, Ash, H, in short further: GG) - a dark horse, gets a job as a collector. Along the way, revealing his skills as a trained fighter and thereby attracting extra attention, he bides his time. For what? For revenge, of course. There is no better motivation for a good action movie than revenge.And at first it really seems that the frame is only for our GG, and the whole world is spinning around. But fortunately, this is not the case. Each character in the film has a purpose and function, they are all cogs in the model of modern society.The motives, goals, and background of each person, each party to the conflict, will be clear and understandable. No, it's not chewed up, you'll see for yourself and figure it out. And most importantly, who is to blame? Everyone is suspicious, even the partners-simple collectors.As a result, the main antipode is not so different from our GG. But is it so obvious? It is important that GG is not a superhero, his every action leads to consequences, here you are not Mary Sue. GG blood and sweat passes through all the twists and turns, and helps us to understand everything shown past, future and of course the present. Where all the arrows converge and it remains to wait for the denouement.Before going to the movies, I didn't understand what a strange name was.

Instead, they make you wonder why you keep watching the movie everytime supporting actors open their mouth.Also, Jason Statham shows his manhood in the movie, yet again, but would need more story to build his bad assness.Definitely a very different style action from a typical Guy Ritchie's movie but it deserves a credit for camera angles.",Wrath of Man

Just a conversation and then he shot him.There were no fight scenes (Indont think a single fist was thrown), and the focus was more on the team of thieves than Statham. There was a thoroughly vague reference to maybe Statham was undercover for the FBI. Andy Garcia was in 3 scenes. Once to tell his team to leave Statham alone.

(Haven't seen Andy Garcia in a while, even though it was a small part). Kinda cool to see Post Malone in a bit part. Whether you're a Statham fan or not, it's entertaining & enjoyable.",Wrath of Man
1099,floydmunetsi-50932,Clever revenge film... sure to be a classic!,8,30 May 2021,"Great film with a simple revenge storyline cleverly written, directed and executed to produce a good balance between flashback scenes, anticipated events and unexpected twists. Great action sequences, and the final act was truly a thrill ride. Hats off to Statham and Ritchie!",Wrath of Man
1100,ianmaddox-43739,Cheese n more cheese,3,31 May 2021,I lasted 20 mins into this ultra macho movie which made me cringe. Can't say what it was all like as I couldnt get past the cringe fest in the locker room.,Wrath of Man
1101,doubleamoore,Horrible!!!,4,12 June 2021,"The first hour of this movie is so bad. The acting is horrible! I have no idea what Guy Ritchie was thinking. His casting was horrible. Jason Statham can act, the problem is he was surrounded by the cast of ""Saved by the Bell"".There is 15 minutes left in the movie as I type this, and I am shutting it off!",Wrath of Man
1102,ankit_capri,Disappointed,4,6 August 2021,Whole time kept waiting something will happen but nothing...disappointing movie..!!!,Wrath of Man
1103,rdaragon,Ignore the fake reviews,10,27 May 2021,"After reading all the phony reviews trying to poopoo this film I figured I would write a real one.This movie is a gem, beautifully shot and edited with a great cast of actors and a wonderful screenplay. The kind of movie that makes you forget where you are and even though it has a 2 hr runtime, it someone seems short. Want to specifically shout out Josh Hartnett who I haven't seen in a movie in years, it was like seeing a really old friend again. But I digress, great performance by him in a great role.Guy Ritchie has really found his groove with two great pieces of cinema in a row. He doesn't get anywhere near the amount of credit he deserves.I highly recommend you watch this film.",Wrath of Man
1104,Heyits_teebow,A Fresh Twist on the Heist Genre,8,27 July 2021,"As someone who is normally turned away by popcorn thrillers (especially when Jason Statham is headlining), I wholly enjoyed this movie!It hits that sweet spot for me of suspense, drama, and good visual effects. Honestly, I will be keeping a closer eye on Guy Ritchie films; I thoroughly enjoyed Gentlemen, and was really surprised by the great storytelling this film achieved despite it being a new flavour of the ""Heist Movie"" that has been rehashed time and time again. This one seems to just work!",Wrath of Man
1105,mailprudhvib,THRILLING.....IN GUY RITCHIE STYLE,7,31 May 2021,"A revenge story between two guys in different crews serving their own goals.

1106,a-baabbi,Good 7/10,7,26 July 2021,It was a good movie. I would recommend.,Wrath of Man
1107,chiras-90261,Worst Guy Ritchie movie,3,16 July 2021,I am a fan of Guy Ritchie. He made snatch for goodness. Now I know Statham can meddle in below average work but this movie and the premise with him looked gold. Only looked. It was horrible. From the acting to the dialogue to the styling. The only thing worth mentioning was the last heist scene. Give it a pass and save your time.,Wrath of Man
