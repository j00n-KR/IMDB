0,SnoopyStyle,crazy Wan horror,5,13 September 2021,"In a research hospital in 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver faces a growing threat from Gabriel who seems to control electricity. She is forced to order ending him. In present day, a pregnant Madison Lake (Annabelle Wallis) is slammed against the wall by her angry husband. A mystery figure kills him and she wakes up in the hospital. Her supportive sister Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson) tells her that she lost her baby. Police detectives Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) investigate.James Wan comes home to horror. I like the backward facing killer. I don't find the mystery that compelling. More than anything, it's a bit confusing more than compelling. At the end of the day, I kept thinking that there is one easy solution... suicide. The movie never has the daring to approach that subject matter. It was always in her head and that's where the battle was going to be won or lost. The electricity is some odd X-Men addition that seems out of place. On the other hand, I do like the visual dreamscape transitions and the over-the-top action. It's crazy enough to work. There is a lot to admire from James Wan but ultimately, it feels a bit empty.",Malignant
1,claudio_carvalho,Reasonable Only,6,3 November 2021,"In 1993, at the Simion Research Center, the dangerous Gabriel kills many doctors and nurses and Dr. Florence Weaver (Jacqueline McKenzie), who is in charge of the case, says that it is time to cut out the cancer.In the present days, in Seattle, Madison Mitchell (Annabelle Wallis) is pregnant after three miscarriages. When her drunken husband Derek Mitchell (Jake Abel) argues with her and beats her head against the wall, Madison passes out and when she awakes, she sees Derek murdered in a gruesome way. Madison loses the baby, and her younger sister Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson) comforts her. Soon Madison has dreadful nightmares with a monster and horrible deaths. When she realizes that the murders are happening in real life, Madison and Sydney look for Police Detectives Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) to report her dreams. What is the mystery behind the nightmares?""Malignant"" is the latest film by the worshipped James Wan and recently released. The style recalls Dario Argento but the plot is only reasonable and inferior to the other well-known works of this director. First, there is superficial character development and does not create empathy between the characters and the audience. The terrible and poor conclusion seems to be a sequel hook. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Maligno"" (""Malignant"")",Malignant
2,nogodnomasters,It's time to cut the cancer out,8,14 September 2021,"The film opens in the 19990's at the Simion Research Hospital near Seattle. Dr. Florence Weaver is experimenting on subject ""Gabriel."" Gabriel has strength and the ability to control electricity. He talks through speakers, ""I will kill you all."" They decide to incapacitate Gabriel. We then hop to the present. Maddie (Annabelle Wallis) is pregnant with an abusive husband (Jake Abel). The next thing we know Gabriel is back and killing. Maddie is seeing the murders in real time.This was an interesting film. Great characters and special effects. Nice little mystery as to what is happening. Fully explained by the end.

3,kosmasp,Evil within,8,12 September 2021,"Horror movies are tough to make. Especially when you are trying to please the general crowd and the hardened horror afficionados. Especially the latter might depict your movie and quite a few things you chose. Now James Wan seems to love a moving camera ... and I think that works nicely. But he also seems to like action ... which is apparent towards the almost insane action set piece almost at the end of the movie. It is so over the top, that one might feel it doesn't belong in there.It still sort of works if you suspend your disbelief. Other points you can critisize are things that are being build up without a pay off. While it may not be too bad when it comes to the (comedic) romance subplot, it is more than weird with a location towards the end. It gets such an epic ... introduction and yet it deflates into almost nothing.Maybe there is more (deleted scenes I'm quite sure), some scenes obviously have been cut, one in particular comes to mind with more romantic stuff, that didn't make it into the movie. Dialog wise that is, just in case you are wondering.But if you only see the negative, you will miss out on the fun and the horror the movie dishes out. The story/plot does check out and while you'll be trying to figure out what is what (and again hardcore horror fans will probably be onto Wan early on), it does not take anything away from the journey.There are some horror cliches too (the very last frame may annoy you), but overall the movie is a nice mixture between horror, comedy and action. If you can dig that, you are on a good way to really like this.",Malignant
4,classicsoncall,"""So I'm putting out a BOLO on Sloth from The Goonies?""",7,23 September 2021,"There aren't too many original ways you can do a horror story left, but this one really pulled out the stops with the introduction of that teratoma on Maddie Mitchell's (Annabelle Wallis) back. I'd never heard of anything like that, and the way it was used here leant new meaning to the word creepy. That was certainly enough to pique anyone's interest level just for the sheer audacity of it. I thought the story had some good hooks and twists, although the manner in which Gabriel was able to take out all those cops was way over the top. As weird as the whole premise was for the story line, I thought it all worked pretty well with a surprising amount of continuity in explaining how Madison got to be who she was. I didn't really see how the ending was meant to offer a definitive conclusion, so maybe there's a Malignant Two lurking in the works. Wouldn't that be a kick in the head?",Malignant
5,lee_eisenberg,they're watching you,6,30 September 2021,"James Wan's ""Malignant"" isn't a horror masterpiece, but it has a clever plot.

6,jboothmillard,Malignant,5,19 September 2021,"The definition of ""malignant"" is: 1) disposed to cause harm, suffering, or distress deliberately; feeling or showing ill will or hatred, 2) very dangerous or harmful in influence or effect); there is also a pathological definition, which will be explained later. The trailer for this scary movie looked eerie, it being directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring, Aquaman) got my attention, and the title certainly sounded sinister. Basically, in 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver (Jacqueline McKenzie) and her colleagues Dr. Victor Fields (Christian Clemenson) and Dr. John Gregory (Amir AboulEla) are treating a psychiatric patient named Gabriel at Simion Research Hospital. Gabriel has special powers, such as controlling electricity and broadcasting his thoughts via speakers. One night, Gabriel turns violent and kills many members of staff in the institution. Twenty-seven years later, in Seattle, Madison Mitchell (Peaky Blinders' Annabelle Wallis) has returned home after her pregnancy has caused her to feel ill at work. She has an argument with her abusive husband Derek (Jake Abel), who smashes Madison's head against a wall, after which she locks herself in the bedroom and falls asleep. Madison later wakes up to find Derek's body after dreaming of a man entering their house and violently killing him. The killer, who is still in the house, attacks Madison, rendering her unconscious. The next morning, Madison wakes up in a hospital and is told by her sister, Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson), that her unborn baby did not survive the attack. Madison is interviewed by police detective Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and his partner Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) before returning home. There, Madison reveals to Sydney that she was adopted at eight years old. Meanwhile, a woman (Jean Louisa Kelly) running a Seattle Underground tour is kidnapped by the killer and strapped to the ceiling in an attic space. Madison has another vision, this time of the killer murdering Dr. Weaver. During their investigation, Shaw and Moss discover a photo of Madison as a child in Weaver's house and learn that Weaver specialised in child reconstructive surgery. Madison tells her sister about another vision she has had, this time of the killer murdering Dr. Fields, so they decide to go to the police. The killer contacts Madison and reveals himself to be Gabriel, Madison's childhood imaginary friend. She and her sister visit their mother, Jeanne (Susanna Thompson), to learn more about her childhood, including watching home footage of her birthday. Madison realises that Gabriel was not her imaginary friend but someone real to whom she spoke during her childhood. Shaw finds a link between the doctors and Madison, which leads him to Dr. Gregory who is the next victim discovered murdered. The detectives enlist the help of a psychiatric hypnotherapist, hoping to unlock Madison's memories. Madison recalls that her birth name is Emily May and that Gabriel wanted her to kill her unborn sister. She came close to doing it but was able to stop herself. The police arrest Madison when the kidnapped woman falls from the attic in her home, revealing that Gabriel was living inside her house. The woman is Serena May, Madison's birth mother. Sydney visits the now-abandoned Simion hospital looking for Emily's records. She finds out that Gabriel is Emily's twin brother who lives within her body as an extreme version of a ""teratoma"" (a tumour), sharing the same brain and body as Emily. During Emily's childhood, Gabriel appeared as a half-formed child facing out of Emily's back. Weaver operated on Emily to cut out the parasitic tumour and sewed Gabriel back into her brain. He was dormant during her childhood but woke up when Derek hit her head against the wall. Gabriel's face now emerges from the back of Madison's skull and operates her body backwards when he takes control, explaining the killer's unnatural movements and upside-down fingerprints at the crime scenes. Madison is placed in a jail cell along with fellow inmates, many being female. When she is provoked, Gabriel takes full control of Madison's body, slaughtering all the inmates and almost the entire precinct with superhuman strength and agility, and eventually escaping. Sydney and Shaw intercept Gabriel at the hospital where Serena is recovering from her captivity. Shaw and Sydney are attacked by Gabriel. Sydney informs Madison that Gabriel is the cause of her numerous miscarriages in the past because he was feeding off her fetuses. Angry at the revelation, Madison wakes up and takes back control of her body. Madison is able to transport herself and Gabriel to a black mindscape (a dark abyss within her mind), and locks Gabriel behind bars, saying that she is now the one in control and that Gabriel's powers are hers now. As Madison leaves Gabriel to rot in the mindscape, he insists to her that he will return one day. Madison says that she will be ready for him and leaves the mindscape. Back in the hospital and in full control of her body, Madison lifts a hospital bed off Sydney with her newly acquired strength. The pair hug as Madison assures Sydney that even though she was adopted, she will always be her sister. Serena looks on happily as they are hugging, while the electric humming that accompanied Gabriel's attacks can be heard faintly. Also starring Marina Mazepa as Gabriel, Ray Chase as the voice of Gabriel, Madison Wolfe as young Serena May, Ingrid Bisu as CST Winnie, Ruben Pla as Officer Rubin, Jon Lee Brody as Officer Lee, Patricia Velásquez as Nurse Velasquez, and Zoë Bell as Scorpion. Wallis is suitably cast as the woman paralyzed by horrific visions of people dying only to realise that they are happening for real, it has a creepy atmosphere throughout, the supernatural element is a bit mixed, but you certainly don't know where it's going, the overly gory kills and bonkers twist are surprising, all in all it is a good enough horror. Worth watching!",Malignant
7,BA_Harrison,Unfairly maligned by some.,8,15 September 2021,"After her abusive husband is murdered, Maddie (Annabelle Wallis) must try and convince the cops that the killer was her imaginary childhood friend Gabriel. Just as the police are ready to label Maddie a basket case, chuck her in a madhouse and throw away the key, Gabriel makes his presence known...James Wan's Malignant begins like so many contemporary supernatural horrors, with a creepy, lank-haired figure lurking in the shadows (of which there are many), occasionally emerging from the darkness to scare protagonist Maddie. The movie is so predictable that, when it shows an award on a doctor's shelf, the trophy boasting a wicked spike, I rolled my eyes: 'Someone's getting impaled on that', I said to myself. And sure enough...It's formulaic stuff, but director Wan is toying with his audience, deliberately laying on the clichés, waiting patiently to pull the rug from under our feet with an outrageous plot twist that shifts the film from a mediocre chiller to an insanely enjoyable, off-the-wall gore-fest in a split second. This abrupt change in style and tone doesn't seem to have gone down too well with some viewers, but I really dug it - it caught me off-guard just as I was about to dismiss the film as just another dull spook-fest. Wan's absurd revelation prior to the final act propels the film into totally bonkers territory, and allows the director to ladle on the splatter as well as inject some well-handled action scenes.After so many dreary horror films that take themselves far too seriously, Malignant is a treat for those who enjoy movies that go a little mad sometimes.",Malignant
8,BandSAboutMovies,VHS fumes and nasty junk,8,14 September 2021,"From the first time Malignant was announced, it was called James Wan's giallo film.A few thoughts on that.It's a giallo film as much as Suspiria is a giallo. That's because most people think, ""Italian horror with red and blue colors equals giallo,"" which is much like someone thinking that all hip hop is rap or all metal has blast beats, maybe. It's a generalization and you know, you have to be fine with it. In a world where reviewers from publications as big as Variety can't understand that Halloween is not a rehash of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you have to expect that some movies need a handle for people to better understand them.To the rest of us, those that haunted the aisles of the video stores minutes before closing, that carried lists of films in our wallets, that went from small town to town trying to find that magical movie drug that our store had no more supply of, I can tell you, if this movie had a Filmirage logo before it, the dubbing was off and a CGI Donald Pleasence or Donald O'Brien showed up, I would not be more surprised.This isn't a giallo. Sure, there's a giallo looking killer with a weapon somehow more ridiculous than the one in Too Beautiful to Die that has identity issues and a history of family madness much like Madhouse, but nope. This is the kind of movie that Screaming Mad George would have done the effects for, that would have had a trailer for Fatal Frames before it, that should have a piece of masking tape with green magic marker that says ""MUST BE 18 TO RENT"" emblazoned on it.So for every review I see that says, ""This has a bonkers third act!"" or ""It starts slow but hold on,"" I wonder, have I done too many movie drugs? Have I inhaled too deeply on the fumes of not only the Argento, Fulci, Henenlotter and Raimi - hail to those mentioning Darkman - that keep getting called out in these reviews, but also Full Moon, D'Amato, Lenzi, Stuart Gordon and so many more? Hell yeah I have. And I have no regrets. Movies mean more to me than most people. They've treated me better than most people. And I get the feeling that this is the kind of movie for people like me.Make no mistake - no movie has made me laugh out loud more this year than Malignant. And no movie made in 2021 will probably bring me so much joy because I kind of love that someone gave Wan $40 million to make a movie for people who say, why don't they make stuff like George Eastman's Metamorphosis or Tibor Takács' I, Madman any more.This is a movie that has a villain that feels like a character someone rolled up using the random character generator tables in an old school role playing game like Champions or Gamma World. ""What'd you roll up,"" we ask a young James Wan. ""Well, he has a giant sword that he made out of a doctor's award. And he can control lightning. And he dresses like he came right out of Strip Nude for Your Killer.""""Cool.""""I'm not done. He can also talk to people through radios.""I mean, can you not see the lunatic zeal of that? And sure, the acting is so bad that you wonder that it just might be a directorial choice - and if so, I love it - but this is also the kind of movie where the fact that Seattle is built above another city gets called out and kind of forgotten - unless you consider that this movie was built on the ashes of stuff like Ghosthouse, Castle Freak and Basket Case - and there's a moment where a character falls out of one part of the movie into another, effectively breaking the narrative just as surely as her body smashes through a house.Is Malignant a transmission from an alternate universe where Wan never stopped making pure junk - and I say that with affection - like Dead SIlence*? Is it someone trying to not have to make Hollywood sequels and screaming for help? Who can say. It's a mess, a glorious, ridiculous, unfocused mess packed with astounding levels of gore and several upbeat songs that don't fit the film at all.I'm shocked it didn't have someone discussing who is more popular in Denver, Kim Basinger or Kelly LeBrock over a ham radio.And in case it didn't come through, I loved this giant steaming pile of movie junk food.*I've done my best not to put any spoilers in here, but there's a security footage moment in here that has puppet work as bonkers and gory as when the villain behind that aforementioned film turned a family patriarch into a human puppet.",Malignant
9,CinemaSerf,Lord Voldemort meets Venom...,7,16 September 2021,"I know I ought not to have, but i did quite enjoy this. Not least, because at times it is actually quite scary! ""Madison"" (Annabelle Wallis) has a rather brutal altercation with her violent husband and next thing we see is the start of a series of brutal, and seemingly unconnected murders. It falls to two detectives - ""Moss"" (Michole Briana White) and her cute partner with a trendy shirt for every occasion ""Kekoa"" (George Young) - to try and piece together the mystery, with the help of the apparently psychic ""Madison"" and her feisty sister ""Sydney"" (Maddie Hasson). The plot is silly, no other word for it, but it is entertaining. The film is well paced, and for the most part the ending wasn't on my radar - there are quite a few functional red herrings to keep it interesting. Sadly, I saw this on my own at our local cinema - it is better than that!",Malignant
10,george.schmidt,James Wan's return to form in a truly unnerving Giallo inspired horror film with echoes of THE DARK HALF.,9,13 September 2021,"MALIGNANT (2021) ***1/2 Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young, Michole Briana White, Jean Louisa Kelly, Susanna Thompson, Jake Abel, Jacqueline McKenzie, Christian Clemenson, Mercedes Colon, Zoe Bell. Filmmaker James Wan - who script collaborated with Ingrid Bisu based on Akela Cooper's screenplay - returns to form in this eerie and involving horror film with Wallis as an abused woman who learns a horrifying truth when she learns her imaginary friend 'Gabriel' is real and seeking revenge with a body count she viscerally experiences. With a dollop of Romero's THE DARK HALF and some Giallo underpinnings the film manages to unnerve as it unspools particularly in its last WTF act of highly stylized cinematic wizardry with aplomb and awe. Wallis - who resembles a hybrid of Cate Blanchett and Isabelle Adjani - particularly the latter's tour-de-force in POSSESSION that her performance echoes in her possession sequences.",Malignant
11,neil-476,Decent enough,7,16 September 2021,"After a disturbing prologue where a doctor prepares to operate on someone/thing called Gideon, we meet pregant Madison, just about to lose another baby when her husband assaults her, banging her head against a wall. She comes to in hospital, having had a vision of her husband's death which turns out to be true. Further visions of others deaths follow. The police disbelieve her, then she becomes a suspect. Meanwhile her sister goes backtracking to try to untangle a backstory.This psychological?/actual? Horror treads a fairly well-trodden path - is Gideon real? Is Maddie psychic? Is she being set up? But it does so in an enjoyable way, with some decent reveals. And the answer pleases. It is completely mental, but it works.I'll say no more. The largely unknown cast do quite well, there is a fair amount of blood, there are some very acrobatic action sequences, there is a complete absence of explanation for the electrical interference which features throughout, and it's not horribly horrific.But, hey, it works.",Malignant

Malignant is another good horror movie on his palmares. I like his style of movie making. Whether you like this kind of movies or not it always will get the attention of the audience. Malignant is highly entertaining if you're into horror movies. The cast did a good job playing their characters.

14,thesar-2,What a ______ ____!,9,11 September 2021,"(Update, I rewatched this and my rating soared from 5/10 stars to 9/10. Not saying it's the second viewing for everyone that will convince people this movie is great - hopefully, people will realize that on their first viewing of this near masterpiece.)For the first two-thirds of this movie, I thought of the best headline, and then I realized: this is basically a remake of that...sooo...Couldn't spoil the whole movie with my headline.In fact, it's like 4 solid movies in one, but mostly the one I thought it was up front. Again, no spoilers, but the one I was referring to came out in April 1982. If you wish to keep Malignant a surprise, don't look up what came out that month/year.Anyhoo, it was okay. I thought the movie looked GORGEOUS and that's not just because it's based in my favorite city of Seattle. Though, boy those shots of Seattle were perfection. I mean the rest of it looked great and we already know Director James Wan has extreme talent and KNOWS horror.Poor Madison. Bad luck with men, pregnancies and a demon following her around. I mean, *I* have demons, but nothing like this where she sees a very bad person killing people in brutal fashions even though it takes place in another location. If she goes to the police, will she be a suspect having full knowledge of these crimes?If you have HBOMax, it's worth a viewing, especially that second half which is FAR superior to the first clunky half. It's definitely for horror movie buffs because Wan has as many references in this as Free Guy did for that genre.***Final Thoughts: Can't believe how right I was with what this movie mostly mimics. And that's not a complaint. I love the original and this complete nod to it is a very nice update. Also, I loved the scenes of Underground Seattle.

16,Cineanalyst,Conjoined and Gendered Body Horror,6,12 September 2021,"Stick with this one, folks; it gets better. The most horrifying part of ""Malignant"" is its first act, including those opening credits that look like they're made for a TV show. I've seen this with a few horror films--walked out on one, for which I don't recall the title, years ago--and saw the dreadful, but cinematically so, ""Flyboys"" (2006) instead, that's how much I detest such thematic credits. And, then, it's just the other tropes of VHS tapes and aesthetics, mad scientists, flickering lights, jump scares, a disjointed monster with hair in its face, and director James Wan doing the same supernatural fluff and visions of murder scenes he'd already done in ""The Conjuring"" series.Then, things get wild, and I'm not just talking about the CGI-enhanced action scenes and twirling camerawork, let alone the supposed merits of being surprised by the perfunctory ""twists"" and the grab-bag of dated stereotypes in a women's jail cell. (I mean, seriously, what trashy 1970s women-prison movie did Wan watch before directing this sequence? Or, for that matter, what's up with the detective and her sucker at the morgue, or the ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" crime-scene tech... but I digress.)I think this is more delightfully in poor taste--almost so bad it's good, if not parasitically so--rather than a cogent commentary on anything, and the religious themes and even quasi-message on the abortion debate--a trendy topic even more so than usual in the U. S. of late, as well as an apt subject for the body horror genre--are there. I just don't think it matters much that the asylum looks like an abandoned cathedral with ""welcome to hell"" written inside, and that the doppelgänger is named after the devil, as in the archangel Gabriel, or that he feasts on aborting fetuses. I mean, it's interesting, but this is the same silly movie that ends with its protagonist Madison wrestling from a man and declaring control of her own body. So, make of that what you will. Regardless, the philosophy doesn't appear as thoroughly thought out as that of, say, fellow horror movie, and case against the (literal) school of post-structuralism philosopher Jacques Derrida, ""The Empty Man"" (2020).That's not to say it's not entertaining and even thought provoking. I especially appreciate the reflexivity, although in this case it's not as impressive as that of ""The Conjuring 2"" (2016), which is much better than the rest of the series, and I generally prefer the body horror here to the supernatural family fare of the Warrens, of all people. There, the monster was a projection of a strip from the ""pre-cinema"" device, or ""philosophical toy,"" the Zoetrope. In a sense, the movie was being attacked by another movie.Anyways, doppelgängers themselves are a highly cinematic notion, reflecting the doubled nature of recorded and mass-produced movies. On top of this, there's Gabriel speaking through various staticky media, there's the VHS films-within-the-film (although nothing more intelligent than may be found in ""The Ring"" films, which are an obvious influence here), and, best of all, although, again, similar to ""The Conjuring"" series, the protagonist acting as a surrogate filmmaker and spectator in projecting and viewing visions of her ""imaginary friend,"" or nevertheless from her shared mind--just as with the picture overall from the minds of the filmmakers. Flickering lights in a horror movie that actually make some sense, cinema being an electrical art as mythically founded (although it's hardly the entire truth of the matter) by Thomas Edison, of light bulb fame, and Louis Lumière, whose surname literally translates as ""light.""",Malignant

I won't spoil anything just going to say - this is a horror movie from always original James Wan. And its one of his best yet. This movie was insane.To start with - at running time 1 h 45 min this movie was very well paced. There were horror scenes very reminiscent to directors previous movies, with camera angles set as only he does that. There were twists and revelations and blood and even an action sequence that seemingly came out of nowhere and was as badass and brutal and unlike anything i saw in a very long time - this movie surprised me in a very good way.Overall, ""Malignant"" (2021) is going to surprise those who do not know what director movie they came to watch.

21,cruise01,Blood bath thrills and a mash up of a 80s horror thriller.,10,15 September 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.Malignant is a great horror film that is entertaining throughout. Plays like a typical supernatural horror movie turned into a 80s slasher flick. The film opens up with a cheesy thrill at a research hospital. Where scientist and doctors are getting attacked and trying to stop something from escaping. A thing called Gabriel. Then, the film flashes to present day with Madison (Annabelle Wallis) who is stuck in a abusive marriage. But begins to have visions of people getting murdered by Gabriel. How is she connected to Gabriel? And who is Gabriel? Does raise questions as Characters are trying to figure out who this thing is. And the body counts rising. When Gabriel moves at an abnormal speed and with body limbs twisting around. It is beyond something more sinister than they can imagine.The films plot takes a turn from a supernatural concept to a slasher flick tone. The films direction does play an intense music score like a cheesy 80s horror movie would be when things get dramatic. Which makes it more entertaining.Cast ensemble did great. Annabelle Wallis did great playing a character that is suffering from a traumatic past. The films plot twist is disturbing and shocking which unravels the story and turning the climatic third act into a blood bath. Lots of gory and bloody deaths.

22,eddie_baggins,James Wan's wildest horror outing yet,5,28 October 2021,"Returning to the horror roots that jumpstarted his career all the way back in 2004 with the genre-defining Saw, Australian export James Wan returns to his genre of choice for the first time since 2016's The Conjuring 2 and a nice little foray into the comic-book realm with the billion dollar hit Aquaman, with the wildly crazy and blood-splattered B-movie masquerading as a Hollywood offering Malignant.Defying explanation, (the less you know about Malignant the better) while Wan's film follows many staples he has mastered over his near two decades in the industry such as creepy houses, jump scares (of which there aren't many in this effort which is more focused around shock value) and a moody score by regular collaborator Joseph Bishara, Malignant is a different kind of beast than what we've come to expect from Wan, who uses his fairly decent sized budget here to go all out creating something that at times is incredibly frustrating and disjointed and at other times can't look away gripping.Without delving into outright spoiler territory, many viewers will be left wondering early on if there's any reason to stick around and discover the meaning behind Annabelle Wallis's poor old Madison Mitchell's grotesque visions that turn out to in fact be real life events taking place courtesy of a villain we come to know as Gabriel, with Wan struggling to get things going early on and while there's a lot that doesn't function on all cylinders in the early and mid-sections of Malignant, come the lead up to the finale you can't help but be shocked and oddly impressed by what Wan has managed to get away with in the Hollywood system.Always a very visually inventive director and one that can create mood and atmosphere with only the bare minimum of opportunities, the latter stages of Malignant allow Wan to go all out in some of the craziest scenes and scenarios you're likely to catch in a feature film this year and go a long way in making Malignant a film worth your time, especially as we learn more about Gabriel's origins and what exactly is driving the monstrous creation to go about his business in the unsuspecting city of Seattle.It's a shame the rest of the film doesn't have as much fun as its final act, Malignant feeling as if in some ways Wan had too many ideas and possibilities to focus on leading up to his end game and while overall it's one of his weaker directional efforts, there's enough freshness and new ideas bought forward here to make this horror affair one aficionados need to make time for, just with expectations in check.Final Say -Not everything works in James Wan's return to the horror marketplace but Malignant's insane and eye-popping latter stages do a good job of making up for what's come before it, proving once more that Wan is one of the best in the business when it comes to chills and spills.2 1/2 precarious parking spots out of 5.",Malignant
23,digitalbeachbum,Horror? LOL please,1,10 September 2021,"I think Alfred Hitchcock said it best, ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it"".There is no anticipation of this movie. It's all thrust right in your face from the start of it. When the bang comes, it is a ""yawn, next please"".I think CG, while technically fun to use to provide an addition to the experience, should not swamp the story for the sake of it existing. It would be far better never to show the creature/beast until the final minutes of the movie.",Malignant

This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight.",Malignant
25,jtindahouse,At times it feels like it's intentionally bad - a bizarre experience,5,13 September 2021,"James Wan is one of the best horror film makers working today. It breaks my heart when he makes a film like 'Furious 7' or 'Aquaman' because it is such a waste of his talents. I have been excited for 'Malignant' for a very long time now due to the pandemic. I finally got to see it tonight, and I'm very disappointed to say it was a big let down.This was a really bizarre viewing experience for me. It felt like Wan was intentionally trying to make a bad film at times. There are moments that are so shockingly campy and unnatural it ruins entire scenes of the movie. Also the theme music was utterly bizarre. It was so over-the-top and unsubtle and often played in moments that were completely not calling for it.The movie tries to pull things together later on in the piece with some interesting reveals, but by then too much damage is already done. There is also a shocking scene near the end which feels like it was pulled straight out of 'The Matrix'. A character suddenly becomes superhuman in their ability to move and it makes no sense at all.I just don't know what happened here. Was Wan so desperate to create something unique and original that he decided this was worth a try? Possibly. Even the best don't get it right every time. 5/10.",Malignant

27,stevendbeard,Different From Most,8,10 September 2021,"I saw ""Malignant"", starring Annabelle Wallis-Peaky Blinders_tv, Annabelle; Maddie Hasson-Impulse_tv, Twisted_tv; George Young-Containment_tv, Yours Fatefully_tv and Jacqueline McKenzie-The Water Diviner, Deep Blue Sea.This is a horror movie that is a little different from most. It's written, produced and directed by James Wan, who has a good track record in different types of movie genres, besides just horror-Aquaman, Conjuring, Furious 7, Insidious and Saw are some examples of his work. The movie begins in the early 1990's where Jacqueline is a doctor talking about a problem patient named Gabriel-you also see Gabriel throw a temper fit. Flash about 30 years into the present and Annabelle is being abused by her husband-she is pregnant-and they are sleeping in separate rooms. During the night, her husband is killed-head twisted around-and she is attacked by someone called Gabriel. She also looses her baby. Is it just a random break in or is there more to it-I'm betting more. Maddie plays Annabelle's sister and George is the investigating policeman. Annabelle has dreams of people-that she doesn't even know-being murdered and she also sees the figure called Gabriel committing them. There is a reason-and it's a good one-why she is seeing these murders. FYI: The spider like movements that Gabriel makes while walking or running are not done with CGI. They used an actress/contortionist-from America's Got Talent-to make it look really creepy.It's rated ""R"" for violence, gruesome images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 51 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_ray.",Malignant

This flick documents how Emerald City brothers are apt as not to emerge from the woodwork to eat their sisters' babies and kill off their husbands. Knowing this, MALIGNANT documents how the local police are likely to give these beleaguered females a pass when their male siblings commandeer their bodies, turn them into Amazon Ninja Warriors and gruesomely slaughter two or three dozen civilians, along with 24 or so law enforcement personnel. After all, who could blame them?Seattle is a misshapen town built upon the haunted ruins of previous civilizations, this picture reveals. Since it rains incessantly there, no one in their right mind would be caught dead in this wetland (unless suicidal). This Pacific Rim shot is dotted with spooky castles serving as experimental surgery suites. Mad doctors award each other humongous trophies in their annual Super Cuts competitions. These heavy metal ornaments contain concealed swords, a fact known only by homicidal maniac conjoined twin brothers of vulnerable girls. If such a sister attempts to sever her family ties, her disgruntled male counterpart is sure to climb out of the back of her skull to manipulate her like a puppet on a rope.

The storyline follows a young lady who has dreams of ruthless murders that upon digging a bit deeper are more real than fiction. Are these premonitions, coincidental, dreams or is she haunted? This movie is directed by James Wan (The Conjuring) and stars Annabelle Wallis (Annabelle), Maddie Hasson (God Bless America), George Young (Containment) and Zoe Bell (Deathproof). The storyline had a lot of potential and a unique premise. The kill scenes was a mix of really well done CGI, over the top violence and fantastic gore. The acting was absolutely painful, as was the script and writing. The film uses very creative lighting and contains great cinematography. The budget really went into the execution more than the story and cast. The end of the movie starting at about the jail scene is excellent but the overall movie is uneven and frustrating at times. This is definitely a must see for horror fans, but a bit disappointing from a horror director as accomplished as Wan. I'd score this a 5/10.",Malignant

37,kluseba,Extreme pace and stunning surprises,8,14 October 2021,"Malignant is a horror movie by genre veteran James Wan that starts on a slow note but soon accelerates and ends with frantic pace. The story comes along with a few surprises that might be controversially received. While the plot is certainly creative, some elements might be going too far to be even remotely believable.The story revolves around Madison Lake, a young pregnant woman who is in an abusive relationship with her husband in Seattle and who has alienated from her sister and her mother. One night, after an episode of physical abuse from her husband, an unidentified intruder gets into their home to brutally murder the husband and assault Madison. She wakes up in the hospital, learning that she has lost her baby and her husband as her estranged sister reconnects with her. Soon after, Madison Lake starts having visions of the unknown intruder as the person goes on a killing spree in Seattle. Madison Lake must find out how the different murders are connected to stop the serial killer and end her own mental torment.Malignant convinces with a slow build-up that soon accelerates the pace and ends with thirty minutes of relentless brutality. These shifts and changes in pace keep the movie dynamic, entertaining and varied from start to finish.The horror movie also oozes with atmosphere. This is due to an excellent use of light effects, a moody soundtrack and clever locations varying from an abandoned mental asylum over sinister underground passageways to a spooky villa.The characters are rather interesting for a horror movie. The clueless, desperate and helpless lead character is easy to empathize with. The way her mother and sister are trying to reconnect with her is heartwarming. The two police officers are quite divergent with one being cold and critical while the other one is more emotional and empathic. The villain is very brutal, emotional and mysterious and viewers should care about the character's unique background.The way the story shifts and changes will be the factor that might make or break the movie for its viewers. Some people might hail the exaggerated creativity while others might feel that the movie turns into sheer absurdity. No matter how you might think about it, the movie's plot is certainly bold, creative and completely out of left field.To keep it short, Malignant is highly recommend if you want to watch an adventurous horror movie that walks off the beaten path and convinces with extreme pace and stunning surprises in the final thirty minutes.",Malignant
38,Pairic,Good Horror Thriller with Plot Twists,8,15 September 2021,"Malignant: Not quite what I was expecting. It opens in 1993 at a strange hospital where young patients are being experimented on. One of them gets free and uses their ability to manipulate electricity and extreme strength to kill staff members before being subdued. Real X-Men/Mutants stuff. Skipping forward to 2020, Madison is injured by her abusive husband Derek, then electrical appliances go crazy and a shadowy figure who is invisible in light kills Derek. Madison develops the ability to see murders as they are occurring. Pretty gruesome, with many violent killings, battered to death with a trophy, stabbed with a dagger fashioned from that very award. In one police lock up cell a veritable massacre takes place. Dark corridors, a dark house, an attic lit through an airfan window where a prisoner is kept ties to a wall. We see more of the horribly disfigured assassin as he battles with police and slays his victims. The tension is maintained throughout the film as the action proceeds at a relentless pace.

41,aidanratesmovies,"An incredibly fun, and an incredibly weird time",9,10 September 2021,"An incredibly bizarre and ridiculously entertaining spectacle- Malignant is a fun but embracingly weird body horror flick that plays ode to many other body horror flicks before it. James Wan is no newbie in the horror world, and it's refreshing to not only see something original in the world of horror on the big screen- but also something new from the vibrant director himself. Its far different from his previous works, both as a writer and a director, and is possibly the years weirdest film so far, and perhaps even the decades'. Although it can be a bit campy and hard to take seriously at times, the film oddly works rather well as a whole- and you're bound to be entertained from start to finish. It's incredibly gorey, well paced, and incredibly well shot. As always, Wan's cinematography plays a key part in his storytelling and allows for a truly visceral and personal experience unlike no other. The acting isn't anything too grand, but all the performers do their best for their roles provided and help to maKe the story feel believable despite its absurdity. It's full of many clever twists and turns, and honestly keeps you guessing till the end. It's far from what I expected it to be, but in the end, Malignant is a film I enjoyed and one i'll never forget.

44,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Combining Sub-Genres for an Interesting Slasher,8,21 September 2021,"This is a movie that I saw the poster for when I went to the theater. From there I heard some buzz about it being the new James Wan film that was in horror. It might also have giallo vibes to it as well. Regardless, I like to support horror so this went on a list to check out for me. Jaime did watch this as well after seeing the trailer. The synopsis is Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is paralyzed by shocking visions of grisly murders and her torment worsens as she discovers that these waking dreams are in fact terrifying realities.We start this back in 1993 at an institute. I believe its name is Simion. There is a Dr. Florence Weaver (Jacqueline McKenzie) recording herself as she talks about an odd child named Gabriel. He is unruly and they are getting to their end with what they can do. A Dr. Victor Fields (Christian Clemenson) informs her that he is free. Dr. Weaver takes the tough decision that they must cut this 'cancer' out.The movie then shifts to the present day where Madison Mitchell (Wallis) comes home to her husband of Derek (Jake Abel). She is in health care and tired. We also see she is quite pregnant. Derek doesn't seem to be as happy and we learn that she has had multiple miscarriages. She upsets him by shutting off the television and he lashes out, hitting her head against the wall. He apologizes and goes downstairs where she locks the door. That night, someone attacks and kills Derek. Madison comes down to see what happened and she is attacked as well.Being called to the scene are Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) who are both detectives. The attack was brutal and not all of the evidence makes sense. Their only witness is Madison, who is in the hospital. Through her sister, Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson), Madison learns she lost the baby. She doesn't have a lot of information to relay to Kekoa either.The next person that is targeted by this killer is Dr. Weaver. Madison was home when this attacked happened, but she was able to see it happen. She went into a form of paralysis and the world around her changes. Dr. Weaver received a call before it happened and she looked at a file for young girl who was in her care. Madison becomes the prime suspect when she goes to the police to tell them what she saw and then even more so when she directs them to the next victim of Dr. Fields. We know that Madison is connected to this killer, but how? The more they look into what happened at the Simion Institute, it makes her an even bigger suspect. Who is doing these killings though?That is where I'm going to leave my recap as I think that gets you up to speed here without going into spoilers. Now I avoided reading or hearing what people thought about this before I got the chance to check it out. I did hear a podcast before writing this though, which was the Horror in the House of Sammons. What I'm glad is that Jamie over there made a connection to another movie I was thinking off and Brian makes another that I didn't think of, but makes a lot of sense too. I am going to avoid spoilers here. This was just something that I should preface with.Where I want to start is with the title itself. I knew that we would have something medical coming in. It doesn't come as a shock with the cold open or the credits. What they do with this is quite interesting. It is taking something we have seen before in horror, but I think we do something a bit different here that I enjoyed quite a bit. I did tell Jaime a major reveal early on into this movie and I was right to an extent. I told her that if I would have been dead on, it would have hurt it. Since they added enough on to it, I appreciated the truth of our killer. It even explains things with how it moves and acts as well.Next I want to delve into something I've heard. Wan states this is his take on a giallo. I only get that from the lighting of the movie, which I loved as it harkens back to Bava or Argento. The killer does wear black gloves and it is a mystery as to who they are. We even have Madison and Sydney trying to solve who the killer is. The soundtrack also has this vibe at times. For me though, this is more of a slasher film. I would loosely give it the term of neo-giallo if anything. Not that this matters, but just my thoughts on this concept.Since I'm going to avoid spoilers, I'll move us next to the effects and cinematography. For the former, I think they are good for the most part. We get blood and the attacks are violent. There are even some good effects with our killer being played at times by a contortionist Troy James. Everything that they did practically looked good to me. There is some CGI. This I'll be honest I'm a bit hit or miss on. I think there are some things that are good, like the transition from Madison as she sees what Gabriel is doing. Some of the action sequences though were a bit much for me. This bleeds into the cinematography. Wan did an excellent job with how this was shot. There are just some things done with the action sequences that turned me off to the movie. I understand that our killer is supernatural, but it is also grounded in reality. Some of the things we see I couldn't suspend enough disbelief. I'm still mostly positive on these parts of the movie.That will take me then to the acting. I thought that Wallis was solid as our lead here. I like that she is torn by what is happening around her, but she cannot explain it. She does things that make her a suspect and that was real for me. Hasson was solid as her sister who no matter what loves her and wants to help. Young is good along with White. I think they play well off each other as our detectives. I thought the rest of the cast was solid for rounding this out to direct our characters to where they go. I did want to shout out Zoë Bell and Mckenna Grace in their cameos. I also thought the combination of Ray Chase, Marina Mazepa and James were good as Gabriel as well.So then in conclusion here, I thought this movie was solid. There was buzz so I was excited to see and I think that this movie lived up to the expectations. We have an interesting story that is blending slasher elements with a bit of giallo and even a medical style movie. The acting was solid. A majority of the effects were as well and the same could be said for the cinematography. The soundtrack I thought worked for the most part. I also like the elements that were incorporated into this movie from other horror films while still doing their own things. For me, I would say that this is a good movie and one of the better for the year. This is another that I want to rewatch before the year end as well.",Malignant
45,rgkarim,Malignant: A CSI Story In Halloween Clothing,8,10 September 2021,"LIKES:A Great Opening:
Like a good book, the opening of Malignant hits fires on all cylinders as it tries to get the atmosphere set up. Wan uses a very good approach of vague terminology, fleeting images of the camera, wicked sound effects and dark settings, alongside foreboding music to get the horror element established. The chilling voice at the end of the sequence alongside the fleeting images of the opening credits really brings the edge back to this film and sets hope for promise.The Visuals:
Wan knows how to set the tone for me in many of his horror elements. Malignant continues the trend of utilizing realistic environments very well and showing that safety is not guaranteed at home. Amidst the town of Seattle, everywhere can be the next stage for the next horrifying moment or murder, especially once the history of the city is brought to light. Wan's use of shadows and playing of light, alongside the dependence, gives you that creep factor long ago established by the Conjuring. His opening moments throwback to the famous scares of 80s-2000s using subtle shifts of light, quick passes from the camera, and the use of those sounds that make us all uncomfortable when we are alone at night. Though the jump scares are sort of old hat, Wan's buildup of the scares is enough to leave you uncomfortable if you are watching in the right setting.The Acting:
Annabelle Wallis nails her role quite well, and I for one loved seeing her talent shine in this movie. She's got the terrified component down we got to see in Annabelle, including the screams, shouts, and horrified look in her eyes at what is about to be revealed. But Wan uses the Tudors star in so much better light as her character jumps past the usual victim of the horror element. Annabelle really brings out a character plagued by tormenting thoughts and a questionable history and the trauma that comes with it. Not too much in the overacting department, I felt Wallis nailed so much of the complexity to Madison, including vulnerabilities, strength, and the apathy that such a role required. Maddi Hasson as Sydney was a great supporting role, a sister that starts out sort of stereotypical cannon fodder for this series, but evolves into a character much deeper than what we expect. She's got the joy of the optimistic sister ready to usher in a new age, the strength of someone dedicated to helping family, and also brings that flirty sensation to try and expand the story of another character. While there was more that could have been done, I give her props for the amount of energy she infused. Not to be outdone George Young hits his role well as the lead investigator, but one who has a little less elitism and stubbornness that these roles require. Unsure if he did his own stunts, I was impressed with the physical acting required of him, and how well he worked with all his fellows actors/actresses to keep the story going.The Story:
Prior to the Conjuring becoming so big, Wan's tales often weren't just about scares, but bringing a tale and a purpose to life. The result was upping the stakes of the horror game, adding some care about the characters, and maybe upping the suspense which helped of course with the scares. Again Wan achieves this element with Malignant, actually putting a story behind the terror he wishes to bring and making sure to weave his characters throughout the entire piece. Madison and the Detectives continue to dance this Tango to the truth, and beneath the layers is of course a history to explain what is going on and how everything came to be.The Mystery:
Much of the story has to do with solving the mystery and the connection between title, premise, and just what was going on in that first scene. As Madison's story starts out, there are clues to give you an idea something is not right, only to set off a chain events that try to help you piece the truth together. I was able to get most of the mystery solved and the connections, but there were two elements that took a bit to piece together, one of which I did not quite get when the twist was revealed. Still, that engaging search for the truth is a big part of what pulled me into the movie and kept me thinking trying to figure out all the clues and where they led.Fight Scenes?For lack of a better word, there are a few elements of fighting that would make the 80s and 90s proud. Malignant tries to incorporate a lot of horror elements into the mix, with great references and call outs to your favorite films, and one of those is a slasher. Like Jason, Michael, and Freddy, Malignant takes those cheesy fights from the 80's and decides to add some heat and coordination with them. The result is some of the best fighting scenes I've seen in the recent years, at least when it comes to lethality of an antagonist. With the music choices, stable camera work and the use of that thriller edge, Wan accomplished a lot when these scenes showed up.DISLIKESNot Scary:
The movie sadly was not scary for me, but that's partly because I've been desensitized to the horror genre and jump scares don't phase me as much as they once did. However. Malignant may not phase a lot of people because of the direction it takes for much of the movie. More a paranormal crime film than an actual horror film, the nature of the thriller and crime takes over more than the horror element. If you've seen NCIS or shows to that caliber, you've got a lot of the gist of this film, but just paint a horror themed coat over it at times. While this again helps with pacing and story, it does sort of blunt the scares I think they wanted to go for it.More Character Usage/Interactions:
Wan did a better job than other horror movies for building a dynamic between characters, but the little hints were only hors d'oeuvres when the movie wrapped up. Some relationships started to bloom, but then that element got cut short, the connections with the victims held some potential based on the shots, and then got cut short, even the bond between sisters showed deeper levels, but again did not live to its full potential. While everything did feel fleshed out enough to be included, but so much more could have been done if not focusing on just one character and their history. I guess in the finite amount of time you have in a film, there is only so much to do, but you can't help but wonder what else they could have done with the connections if more time was given.The Visions Aspect:
Necessary for the story indeed, but the visions aspect was not as creative as the movie could have done and really did not feel like it was needed. In having these visions, it's potential could have been more ingrained with how they were showing up and how they could have been used, with things like Minority Report, or Harry Potter painting my thoughts. In this movie, not quite that caliber, and given what was used... I can't say that the movie really needed it in terms of showing the murders, as it still felt like we were just watching murder scenes in a CSI. Fortunately the logic behind it does make sense to try and make up for it, so points thereThe Defying Of Logic:
I know, it's a horror movie and logic does not necessarily go hand and hand with it, but even Wan stretched the disbelief a little at the end. When the revelation hits and the ending starts to wrap things up, the horror element sort of breaks the rules a bit too much when you see what happens to a lot of people. Creepy when it happens? Absolutely. Ridiculously horrifying? Yep. But in keeping with the logic of everything else... it just does not stay consistent and I can't say that the movie did the best with handling this element and keeping to the physics it itself established. I think a few lines in the movie are supposed to help set the exception, but again it's a bit cheesy for my tastes.The Ending:
Once the twist finally arises, the movie sort of drops for me as this is when the movie starts to hastily wrap up in a manner that sort of sweeps the buildup away. It starts going really down the drama element at this point, and all the manners of the horror element are dropped at this time. Wan and his group start to write a little more of the politics, finally start changing the nature of the relationships, sort of hastily tie things up, and of course leave it vague enough for you to interpret what you want. While there are some great artistic moments, the movie's ending just did not feel the same Wan punch I felt back in Conjuring 1 and 2. Again I would like to go more into detail, but that would be spoiling.The VERDICT:
Malignant holds promise for Wan getting back into the horror element he hit us with so long ago and the incredible adventures he can take us on in this element. An opening scene with themes that are used throughout to make it creepy, this film will get many amped up with the elements of realism that he chose to take. A good story and acting to bring it alive, the movie focuses a lot on the mystery and trying to find the truth behind the madness taking place. However, this crime like movie is not the scariest things to emerge from Wan's imagination, and the very nature of the crime element is the main reason given how many shows that have done this same motif exist. In addition, the movie suffers from not using its vision aspect to the best level leading to sort of a lackluster finish, handles most of the character relations to only a third of what it could have done, and then puts a bow on the ordeal that only half tied. Overall it's an enjoyable film that needed more time to handle everything they put into it, and perhaps if it was spread throughout two movies or a mini-series it would have achieved its full potential. Still, it was nice watching at home and feel HBO Max is the prime place to view this film.My scores are:Crime/Horror/Mystery: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Malignant

49,arungeorge13,Not everyone's cup of tea but it definitely is mine! [+67%],7,21 September 2021,"James Wan's Malignant is the kind of film that revels in its campy premise, stylistic visuals, over-the-top twists, and a remarkable score. Yes, the tonal shifts are quite sudden (from supernatural horror to actioner) but the film manages to stay insanely entertaining while at it. The third act is completely bonkers, and I mean that in a fun way. There's ample gore, superbly staged set-pieces that'd rival most films tagged under the ""action"" genre, and even lines of dialogue that make you unexpectedly chuckle. The good thing is that the hotchpotch is handsomely packaged from the twisted mind of Wan, who goes all out in his approach.The film's production design (by Desma Murphy) and cinematography (by Michael Burgess) warrant more attention than the performances or the plot. In fact, Malignant is purely driven by its aesthetics alone - every shot oozing visual flair, soaked in pulsating score. I also liked how Wan conceived the murder scenes - the camera rotates and the environs suddenly change into a sort of live nightmare and then the protagonist, along with the viewers, has to experience it firsthand. This is a style reminiscent of horror films in the '80s. Once again, the antagonist in a James Wan is a weird contorted entity with a detailed backstory, part of which you just have to unquestionably digest in order to enjoy the film to its fullest.The main theme that runs throughout the film is a synth version of The Pixies' ""Where is my mind?"" - an apt choice. Joseph Bishara's score serves as the delicious topping in this aesthetic feast. Annabelle Wallis does a fine job overall though she's wooden in certain scenes, especially when she undergoes the transformation. Her younger counterpart played by McKenna Grace is impressive in those few scenes. I get it if you find Malignant to be painfully mediocre (and outlandishly plotted) because it didn't cater to your tastes but this is certainly the kind of James Wan film that I want to see more often. Bring on the sequel!",Malignant

But occasionally we have something new, Get Out was brilliant, Pet Cemetery was great and now this.This movie went for dramatic impact and narrative impetus, everything was sacrificed for the story like a Hitchcock or a Dan Brown, forget the contrivances and gaping plot holes it just doesn't matter in James Wan's world.Apart from the brilliant and inventive script, fabulous ""horror"" acting, great styling and quite amazing camera work, this movie was quite tongue-in-cheek and had tons of humour. The humorous elements negated any criticism you might have had over the bewildering conclusions. I laughed out loud at one point, I am sure I was meant too!Special mention for Annabelle Wallis, she played the central lead, and the entire movie rested upon her performance, well she delivered in spades, watch out for the hypnosis scene it was simply incredible.I loved this movie, I think you can tell, I'm deducting 1 mark out of 10 because I feel the movie need a more comprehensive last scene, we were all cheering for our detective hero and we were left in the air.",Malignant

53,lambiepie-2,A background noise film from a good producer/director,3,10 September 2021,"Let me explain what a ""background noise"" film is. It's one of those films that interest me, but doesn't call for 100% of my attention. So while I am doing something else, I have the film on in the background for ""background noise"".With backgrounder films tho', if it gets interesting at points: I do watch it again with fuller attention. I've heard about enough of this, and once is good. I watched it for James Wan, he has made some of my very favorite contemporary horror films. This one, Malignant, had some very neat cinematic visual effects here and there that helped with tension and scope, but not enough to carry my interest throughout the film.As an older horror buff, there were quite a few things I had seen done in other movies 100s of times before, and that kinda depressed me on a James wan film, He usually goes above such things and charts a different path. Not here.This one was an almost ""phone it in"" kinda film for James from what I saw; but for me a ""background noise"" one. It's a story I've seen already told - and figured it out in the first 5 minutes. However, I found the ""jail scene"" reveal more funnier than frightening only because of that.This is not to spoil it for the folks who have never seen this kinda thing before, they may find it horrific and engrossing. Go ahead, take a look, enjoy.But for the other horror buffs out there, we've seen it before, will figure it out and there is where it becomes a let down or should have just been a good one hour installment on the ""Creepshow"" revival.",Malignant

55,IonicBreezeMachine,"James Wan outdoes himself with an audacious, almost giallo-like ride of violence, mystery, and intrigue anchored by a strong performance by Annabelle Wallis.",9,10 October 2021,"Madison Lake Mitchell (Annabelle Wallis) is a woman in an abusive relationship with a history of miscarriages only making it worse. When a mysterious figure kills her husband, Madison finds herself at the center of a mysterious string of murders involving a figure from her past who may r may not be real.Based on an original idea by director James Wan, Malignant finds Wan back in familiar territory following his effects laden dive into the Atlantean world of Aquaman. Taking inspiration from Italian giallos, Malignant takes well established tropes of the subgenre puts Wan's own unique twisted spin on them. With that said, I think it's important that people have the right mindset when going into this movie, because it's not a traditional horror like The Conjuring or Insidious films and is more in line with something from vintage Dario Argento or Mario Bava (but even then I feel like I'm underselling it).The movie is anchored by a strong performance by Annabelle Wallis who makes a great protagonist who straddles the line between unreliable narrator and tormented heroine. The visuals where we see Madison glimpse unexplained murders are visually interesting and well-staged. Maddie Hasson is equally good as Madison's adoptive sister, Sydney, serving as an emotional tether and ally to Madison throughout the nightmare she experiences playing the role with both warmth and a cheeky bit of humor (including a bit involving psychic detectives that was very funny). I can't really describe the movie any further because it's one of those that's better experienced than described, but the first half-hour won't hook you and I do encourage you to stick it out and keep in mind what type of movie this is trying to be.Malignant is a twisty, bloody, and entertaining ride built upon intrigue, suspense and a memorable villain. Its story piles on one twisting revelation after another with each one feeling earned and building upon the previous revelation. Highly recommended.",Malignant
56,gedikreverdi,Everything looks so beautiful in this film,8,11 September 2021,"I'm surprised to see that many people hate it. It has some comedic factor and hilarious moments and for some people it ruined the experience. As for me it felt very 80's like Night of the Creeps. The detectives were really funny especially the female detective and when it's revealed that Gabriel is actually the parasitic twin at the back of her head just like Voldemort, I felt very surprised and found it pretty funny at the same time.I liked how the old psychiatric research center by the shore looked. I liked the gory killings even though some of them were offscreen but still when the detectives arrived, we got to see some gory scenes. Gabriel stole one of the trophies that belonged to the doctor that did research on him and fashioned it into his weapon. His weapon and outfit looked really cool. The scene where the detective chased Gabriel down the fire escape ladder and down in the abandoned underworld of Seattle was really cool as Gabriel moved really fast and swiftly and he looked like an evil superhero. Gabriel nested in the attic of Madison and abducted their biological mother there. When she fell out of the attic in front of the detectives, Madison got arrested and turned the precinct into a bloodbath. Madison got to imprison Gabriel in her brain before he got to kill her step sister and biological mother.",Malignant
57,hnt_dnl,Unintentionally campy flick,5,20 September 2021,"MALIGNANT (2021) is already a polarizing film. While the final result of this movie appears to be a campy horror flick, I don't believe that was the intention of director James Wan. First, look at his track record. What campy movies has he made exactly? Saw, Insidious, and The Conjuring series are all intentionally dark and serious explorations of horror. And I don't believe Malignant is meant to be different. Second, what intentionally campy horror movies are almost 2 hours long? Usually, movies like that would have about a 90-minute running time, not be filled with all this backstory, obvious ""serious"" scenes, and long drawn out sequences meant to be suspenseful. Yeah, I think that this movie is campy and even entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons.The opening hospital scene set in the early 90s had awful line delivery by the actors playing Gabriel's doctors. MAYBE if the rest of the movie had kept that vibe and tone, I would have believed it was intended, but the opening present day scene after the cool opening title sequence ended that theory. This scene features a cliche interaction between our protagonist Madison (played by Annabelle Wallis, who starred in the Conjuring universe flick Annabelle) and her abusive husband. Madison is pregnant and her husband violently knocks her against the wall. And the scene was played deadly serious. Then there were all the dramatic family scenes between Madison and her younger sister and mother. Also, there was the hypnosis scene that was played for drama, yet it ended with that kidnapped woman miraculously crashing through the ceiling to set up Madison getting arrested. That scene was supposed to be dramatic but I found myself laughing. Yes, the movie had the 2 useless, wisecracking cop characters, but virtually every serious movie that comes out of Hollywood nowadays feels the need for ""comic relief"" characters like this to break the tension.There were so many conveniences and ridiculous things in this movie. The cop had the aged up picture of Madison right there on his desk but never looked at it and he and his partner just got through questioning her. Why couldn't the cops put 2 and 2 together to figure out that the first 2 murder victims had worked together at that hospital? How in 2021 with internet access are they wasting time having sketch artist doing age ups when they could do it with a simple google picture search? Then once they found the 3rd doctor murdered, why did they not consider just interviewing people who worked at the hospital to get to the root of the problem? Instead, these 2 clueless cops just basically wait for Madison and her sister to tell them how to do their job. Why did the male cop all of a sudden act like he didn't see Gabriel and chase him through the streets of Seattle?Why did the sister go to the hospital to get the records and proof that Madison was innocent? The cops should have done that. Also, why would she go to the hospital to see the biological mother, who was comatose, rather than go the police? And what was with that weird and over the top emotional ending with Madison claiming that her adopted sister was her real family? We already knew this! She's been with this family since she was like 7 years old, of course she'd consider her her real sister. And she says this with her biological mother in the room who'd just woke up from a coma seemingly to twist the knife. The woman came from an abusive past and a man forced himself on her when she was a homeless 15-year old with no family and she gave birth to a monster baby. I think she deserves to be cut some slack.The movie also had that annoying soundtrack played at the most odd times throughout. Then there was that climactic police station sequence where somehow, Gabriel, this man-child who had been suppressed in Madison since he was a child, can miraculously fight and defend himself like he's Batman! And he's doing all of this while moving backwards. The odd thing is that I found some of the movie entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons. I would say that Malignant is destined to be one of those ""so bad it's good"" cult classics in the next 10 to 20 years, but there's already a large contingent that thinks this movie was actually MEANT to be camp. I'm definitely not one of them. Then there are those that actually think this is a horror masterpiece like Saw or The Conjuring. At least the camp group sees the humor in Malignant, even if they some of them mistakenly think that the camp is intentional.",Malignant

59,meddlecore,And A New Ultra-Villain Is Born...,6,18 October 2021,"Malignant is a comic book horror film from writer/director James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Insidious).Here, he has taken the character from his comic series Malignant Man, and flipped everything around to make the character a villain.Annabelle Wallis plays the lead role, a young woman named Madison Mitchell, who starts to become tormented with visions of murder, after being struck in the head during a domestic dispute with her partner.The only thing is...the murders she sees in her waking dreams during sleep paralysis...are actually occurring.And helping only focuses attention on her.At first, they lead you to believe it's tied to the ""entity"" experience (like the 1981 film The Entity is based on); the experience of witnessing a dark faceless entity during a fit of sleep paralysis.But as things progress...we discover that was just a ruse.Because it turns out that Madison was formerly Emily...a child born hideously deformed to a young mother who was raped.Having partially absorbed her twin- which is nothing more than a sentient cancerous teratoma- they have become fused at the brain, in what can only be described as a monstrous form.It turns out that Madison was adopted after being surgically separated from her ""evil"" twin, whom was always encouraging her to do bad things...because- or so thinks at least- he's the devil.The only thing is...that when they were separated- because they were fused at the brain- a part of her brother- Gabriel- had to be left attached to her, and so was sewed back into her skull.So she has always retained a psychic connection with him...to the point that his adopted family though it was her imaginary friend that she blamed her mischief on.However, it was always Gabriel playing her like a puppet from behind the scenes...because he did not die when they were separated...well...not exactly, at least...It's safe to say you hope you're never in a position to find out.The whole thing has a sort of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on.But still retains an element of freshness...even if it is adapted from the director's own comic book series.When all is said and done...a badass new ultra-villain has been established.And you've got to appreciate the effort that went in to all those action scenes those stunt doubles are featured in.Because they always have to make the character look like it's fighting with a backwards stance, while still trying to maintain a martial arts level of fighting flow.You can tell just by watching it...that it's not an easy feat.Looks like they shoot a bunch of sequences in on direction, then reverse the direction and speed up the scene to get the end result.And they don't skimp on the special effects!There is quite a bit of gore in this, and it is all tastefully done...which is surprising...because the entire first half of the film is heavy on the CGI effects...but they return to more traditional effects for the latter half of the film, where all the action, blood, and gore take place.The story could have been developed a little more cohesively...but that's a small gripe, directed at, what is an otherwise, pretty entertaining film.It's not the best film ever made, or anything.It's a comic book film, mind you.But if you're looking for a little action with your horror this Halloween season...this film is the film for you.5.5 out of 10.",Malignant

She is shocked to learn that these dreams are actually taking place.Malignant is a crazy movie & not in a positive way. Director James Wan has given us a horror movie that's more along the lines of the disappointing Dead Silence(2007) than his iconic films Saw(2004), the Insidious franchise & The Conjuring franchise. The twist in the climax is the strong point of the movie but, doesn't make up for the ridiculous story & bad direction. This movie never gets boring so, it also has that going for it. It's not at all scary though. In fact for some godforsaken reason, halfway through it turns into an action film. Many scenes are unintentionally funny. What really drags this movie down though, is the performance of Annabelle Wallis as Madison Mitchell. Wallis really can't portray the emotions necessary for a horror film. This was a problem even in Annabelle(2014), which also had her in the lead. Maddie Hasson is awesome as Sydney Lake. George Young is great as Kekoa Shaw. Michole Briana White is brilliant as Regina Moss. Jean Louisa Kelly is excellent as Jane Doe. Susanna Thompson is superb as Jeanne. Mckenna Grace is spectacular as Young Madison.

62,Vivekmaru45,Perhaps the worst film James Wan ever made in his career as a director.,1,12 September 2021,"To put it into plain words, I found the movie a stereotypical attempt at a cross-over horror with some elements of science fiction more akin to human biology. I also found some parts of the film thoroughly disgusting and revolting. For those of a sensitive nature and weak stomachs you would do well to skip this one.I don't want to dwell too deeply into the plot that surrounds this movie. Put briefly it deals with a woman called Madison Lake who cannot conceive a child. One night she is assaulted in her home and the next moment she wakes up in hospital. From then onward she tries to piece together what really happened.I have seen excellent movies directed by James Wan in the past - Saw(2004), Death Sentence and Dead Silence(both in 2007) are among his best films.

I think if you married The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers films and an 1980s B-slasher film and added Marvel (MCU) CGI to it, this is what it would be like. I just didn't like the larger than life campy screenplay. But I do think the teen and early 20s audience will like it. But the over 40 probably will not.I did find some parts funny, but I don't know if they were intentionally funny. Such as when
Michole White holds up the composite sketch of the suspect, Gabriel. I wonder if they had played out that scene on camera, how would Madison Mitchell and Sydney Lake giving detective Regina Moss a description of the perpetrator?I gave it a 4 because while I didn't care much for the story or the film, I do appreciate James Wan technical expertise and high production value behind the camera lens and his CGI team. He is a master of the technical film making skills of his time. But I don't think this film will stand up against the test of time as special effects marches forward.

66,kjproulx,One of James Wan's Best Horror Films,8,14 September 2021,"From Saw to Aquaman, or Insidious to Furious 7, James Wan has been a filmmaker I've always admired, especially when it comes to horror. He's one of the few mainstream horror filmmakers that hits way more than he misses. I've enjoyed almost every single one of his movies, even including critically lukewarm ones like Death Sentence or Insidious: Chapter 2. I was already planning on checking out Malignant when I heard it was his newest directorial effort, but I wasn't expecting just how different it would be from the rest of his horror work. Here's why, especially if you're a horror fan, Malignant is great.Honestly, even though it still works now and then, I've grown pretty tired of big, open houses being the setting of every horror film. For that reason alone, I wanted to roll my eyes when this film started. That's also a hurdle of my own to get over, so I didn't let that seep into my enjoyment. Malignant begins with a flashback to give some context as to what may be happening. In the present day, Madison (Annabelle Wallis) continuously has visions of people being brutally murdered. Trying to tell people what this may be, causes quite the stir among the members of the Seattle Police Department. Once the investigation begins and strange occurrences begin, this film doesn't hold back.With a nice blend of practical effects, CGI, and some very clever camerawork by cinematographer Michael Burgess, I couldn't look away from the talent being showcased on-screen. That's also in part to the fantastic eye that James Wan has as a director. His vision is always clear and you can just tell you're watching one of his films. For that reason alone, considering how well-done the visuals were in this film, I was simply glued to the screen. On top of that, the shock values here were a total surprise to me.When it comes to gore just for the sake of gore, sometimes that can completely derail a film for me. When gore is done for a specific reason though and it genuinely shocks you, I have nothing but praise. There is a reveal toward the end of the film that I didn't see coming at all and what they do with this reveal was very unique. Sure, this reveal will probably not sit well with everyone and it may even ruin the movie for you if you can't go along with it, but it really worked for me. It was weird, but not at the same time and that's what made it feel plausible, even though it's not.Overall, Malignant's first act did drag a bit for me, which had me starting to lose interest in the beginning, but when this film gets going, it doesn't let up. I thought Annabelle Wallis and Maddie Hasson played off each other nicely as sisters and I believed their relationship, as well as the two main detectives, played by George Young and Michole Briana White. This was a very solid cast, working with a very solid screenplay, with an overall solid and unique story. The first act was a bit boring for me as it felt way too familiar, but the film chooses a completely different direction very quickly and it ended up really working for me. Malignant is now in theatres and streaming on HBO Max and it definitely gets a recommendation from me.",Malignant
67,kuarinofu,A b-movie from Wan? OK...,5,11 September 2021,"Wan wanted to do something different and it's fine.The film itself isn't that good though. It's just your basic b-movie slasher with a couple of memorable scenes.The film packs quite a run-time, so when they completely spoil the 'twist' in the first 15 minutes of the film...the story just continues on auto-pilot.Everything past the first house scene is done by the book, they repeat the same scenes and you know everything that is going to happen up until the end.There was still quite a good amount of neat stuff in the film. I enjoyed some of the moving shots, they also used the house set in an interesting top-down perspective, matrix action scenes were great too. They had a real house for exterior shots and a set for the interior ones that was like 2 times bigger, so they've decided to use it in a creative way, cool.I also enjoyed the sitcom parts, all the ""Where is my mind"" remixed stuff did fit the style of a b-movie.I'm not sure though why would they put serious and dark scenes in this, like the loss of the baby scene.The main lead was also likable and a pleasure to watch.Other than that, most of the b-plot stuff just gets abandoned, like the cop-sister possible relationship, the young police expert crush on the same guy with the weird name, and his possible death as well.The ending of course suggests that this could've been a fake vision by Gabriel, but this was already done much better in Upgrade by Whannell so whatever.I just wish that it was real and the sequel will be a procedural comedy from Wan on the legalities of all the murders resulting in 350-year imprisonment.",Malignant

Do not let your young kids see this.It's been so long since there's a horror that truly terrifies yet excites me at the same time. James Wan loved to do jump-scares and suspense horror. And that was true for the first 2/3rd of the movie. There's some unique twist in the way the horror was brought about in this part.But alright alright alright the real stuff started once the major twist was revealed. Probably the most violent and bloody horror I have seen this year. My eyes were glued to the screen throughout.The first minor problem was the first part, which relied too much on jump-scares. Another one was a character that had a questionable action of going to an abandoned place by themselves.Overall, it's time to drop the Shang-chi overhype. A new vision of terror is here now. 9.5/10.",Malignant

Every dialogue felt forced and unnatural. This movie uses every horror cliche there is and expects you to take it seriously. I'd definitely recommend watching it if you're interested in a movie that is so bad that it's good. This movie was predictable? I'm so sorry, but it was. Anyone who watches movies will immediately know the result of this. BUT, it was a wild ride. Scary??? Uhm. No. Fun, wild, insane, gory?? Yeah, but I can confidently say that this isn't what I think most horror fans are starving for.

The talented director picks up a thematically rich, mysteriously intriguing narrative written by the feature film debutant Akela Cooper, and lets himself get inspired by the giallo genre. Boasting a fascinating protagonist brilliantly interpreted by Annabelle Wallis, the unexpected yet exposition-heavy revelations of the brave third act definitely improve upon a rather generic, unexciting first half. While the impressive action sequences steal the technical spotlight, Joseph Bishara's score holds divisive creative choices that might not please every viewer.

72,SoumikBanerjee25,"James Wan, What have you done?",4,25 October 2021,"I have enormous respect for James Wan and for what he did for this industry. I would go as far as to say; he revolutionized the entire Horror Scene in Hollywood, kind of changed the scenario all on his own. Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious or the Conjuring; he attained some of the remarkable feats for this Genre in the last two decades. I expected nothing less from him this time as well.Little did I know, this time he won't be in his natural space. If I'm being completely honest, this is the very first time I have disliked a James Wan production. Never imagined that one day he too could be the reason behind my displeasure.Where do I start? Everything felt obnoxiously pretentious and inherently displaced. Barring his signature visuals, this is not the James Wan we fell in love with. Malignant is careless, erratic and on top of all that, it doesn't have a clue what it wants to become. Was this supposed to be a Horror or a Sci-fi? Perhaps an Action Thriller? I guess? Slasher? No? Then what did it try to achieve?This exact concern had nagged me for the film's entire duration. The Writers seemingly had a rough time deciding what path to choose. And now that I'm writing all this stuff, I am having a sudden realisation about what might have just happened in here.Let me explain.You get these conventional thrills that are very reminiscent of SaW, you also get Wan's trademark horror from his earlier works like The Conjuring or Insidious and then you are getting a few of those dramatic and emotional aspects that have probably been derived from something like Death Sentence.Can you connect the dots? Hold on, Let me make it easier.Just take a look at that action sequence towards the end, even though it's very John Wick wannabe (again! For the umpteenth time) But it does share a lot of parallels to Furious 7, another James Wan directorial. Not only that, The Score reminds me so much of Dead Silence's thematic Intro and bits and pieces of SaW's original soundtrack.I know it all sounds strange but believe it or not, it may as well be a homage to all of his prior assignments! Unluckily for him, his ambitious or should I rather say 'naive' intentions didn't have a payoff in the end. And being an admirer of this guy, it goes without saying that my disappointment is now immeasurable.",Malignant

It's not a style that's going to please everybody, since it pretty much involves being schlocky on purpose. I'll admit, for most of its runtime, I wasn't completely into it.However, the third act of this movie is INSANE. There's a big reveal that's it's so perfectly delivered and so hilariously messed up that I can't see anyone having a problem with it. Perhaps with the rest of the movie, but not that. That third act made this movie special. Though what came before did leave some to be desired, it goes out with a bang.",Malignant

What happens is actually pretty insane and creative, but the execution of it is so ridiculous that you just can't take it seriously.Given how cheesy this movie was at the start and knowing James Wan was the director, I figured they had to be in on it and doing it intentionally. But as the film progresses, you realize they're actually playing it completely straight and it's honestly just that bad. This movie really isn't scary either which was surprising.The camerawork is big highlight and the over-the-top 80s music was pretty fun. You can tell Wan was trying to make a throwback here, but he forgot the self-awareness that's necessary for movies like this. I know some people are saying the camp is intentional, but even if it is, it could have been executed far better than this.I will give Wan credit for creating a truly original horror film that actually surprised me.

Of course the premise is ludicrous, and the movie is chockfull of horror cliché's, but the pace is high, the make-up and special effects are well done, the photography is really excellent, and there are numerous tension-filled scenes and pretty decent jump-scares. The acting is fine (if you can overlook Annabelle Wallis's constantly ear-scorching screaming!), and the extensive climactic finale is a delightful mixture of preposterous camp and serious gore, in a wannabe Tarantino-like show-down where the murderous monster goes rampant.

79,statuskuo,Perhaps It Wasn't Bad Or Silly Enough,2,14 September 2021,"Those with positive reviews that accuse people of not ""getting it""...start with getting over yourselves.I can watch ""Frankenhooker"" and understand the campy fun and silly humor that is involved there. If director James Wan set out to make a ""movie so bad it's good"" he failed. Repeat: failed.Because it lacks the sincerity that the previous fun, silly camp movies provide. I will give him credit for attempting it. Or so it is implied. For me it was a slog. And a total abandonment of this type of film.Let's get real people, when the detective comes into the room of Madison (Annabelle Wallis) and reveals she's had three miscarriages because the doctor told him...you know this is poorly conceived. For those too dense - when have doctors ever revealed someone's medical history, even if it were the police with warrant). Duh.Okay, her sister, Sydney (Maddie Hasson) is horrific in her acting. Almost as if she spat out the words and Wan told her she was doing great. Sure she questioned his every decision from that point on. That is...IF they were making a schlocky horror/action/medical drama.Speaking of which...did they cast the partner of Detective Shaw as some whacked out lady who just spews cop tropes? Okay...maybe she was suppose to be playing the caricature of a cop or something. It's a mess.You do get a sense that this is a put-on when you arrive in the jail cell and the hookers or whatever are dressed like they were from the rejects of an 80's sitcom ""Night Court"" Ugh.Perhaps it was a put on but the HORRIFIC cinematography had me absolutely confused. Look, Michael Burgess, son of Don Burgess ASC, why in God's name did you light it so video-looking and then proceed to make it look like it went thru motion smoothing. Those who put the cinematography as a plus? You guys blind or dumb?Okay, venting aside, I felt that MAYBE the flick was just too uneven for me. They had ridiculous moments, like the boyfriend/husband character plays out a well worn abusive relationship soap opera garbage. And maybe that should've been the warning. But, this was just dumb but not that beyond dumb.Incidentally...you cannot try for this level of dumb. It has to be by mistake. I think the people who made it most likely wanted it to be that, but came out...weird.",Malignant

81,lareval,Only James Wan could deliver a movie like this,7,6 September 2021,"'Malignant' is a beast of a movie: while it's an original story, its influences are noticeable when we look back at De Palma's ""Dressed To Kill"" (the dressing of the killer -and the duality- reminded me of this and Jigsaw's coat in 'Saw' franchise) or even Fincher's ""Seven"" (the Chase scene down the stairs of the building), with a special mention of Argento's giallo of ""Suspiria"" (the bright and deep red). But James Wan has that extremely good style of his own that proves he's the only one who could have brought the unnerving and stunning feelings to the screen and showing us how he's sorely missed in ""Conjuring 3"" (stunning tracking shots, a straight camera following the characters while introducing us in the Evil atmosphere, the use of dark spaces to imply something lurking there while not being actually able to see it clearly).The story of the movie is a diabolically fun trap. While the clues are there and you are capable of expecting Wallis' character to be involved with the killer in some way, I higly doubt anyone could really exactly predict the awesome reveal of the final act. Maybe some stuff is predictable, but not all of it. And it's both shocking and refreshing to see how Wan isn't restrained at all and uses blood, gore and explicit elements to squeeze the comfort of the audience. The pacing is good and the somewhat typical build up helps to get better and wilder towards the climax.Not everything is fine though. Here Wan has caught some ""Shyamalan virus"" -irony- in terms of some clunky characters and cliched dialogue (mostly the police). Also the performances are not that good: Annabelle Wallis is really good, but she is the only one that works of them all to me. And those cracks hurt a bit what could have been the best Wan movie since 'Conjuring' or 'Saw'.But, to sum it up, this is a good horror fun and a pleasent surprise with a twist in the end that elevates the movie. It's on the better side of the director's career and a great throwback to classic, bloody horror movies. Great fun!",Malignant

83,ethanbresnett,A very pleasant surprise,7,12 September 2021,"I'm not particularly a horror fan and it's by no means my genre of choice, but I was left very surprised by how good this film was.It has a pretty conventional opening, full of the usual horror tropes and cliches which in fairness are well executed. There is a strong sense of suspense and dread and general creepiness even during this opening derivative hour.What really propels this film is the final 30-40 minutes. There are several revelations which certainly blindsided me and were hugely satisfying, entertaining and horrific in equal measure. From a plot point of view I found this film quite fresh and exciting, even if it is maybe 15 minutes too long.What you really want from a horror film is a good atmosphere and I thought Malignant had that. As mentioned there was a strong general creepiness about the film, which was never too over the top although it did get close at times.I also loved the fact that James Wan clearly had a tongue in cheek approach to certain elements of this film. Certain characters and bits of dialogue provided some good contrast to the horror and gave the film another dimension to it.Malignant also boasts some solid performances for the most point as well as some top notch horror action.At its worst Malignant is very been there done that, at its best it's wildly entertaining, genuinely horrific and scary. Balance this out and you get a very enjoyable and mostly well executed horror.",Malignant

It's NOT!If You HAVEN'T seen this movie and you ENJOY 70's and 80's Slocky Horror, full of every idiotic Horror Trope, then PLEASE DON""T continue Reading as there ARE A TON of SPOILERS in this Writing.1st, I turned on video and walked into kitchen to get snacks, I went, ""OH NO!"" Please tell me that horrible music and dialogue I'm hearing is the Character in the Movie watching a horrible 70's or 80's Horror movie on their TV. When I re-started video, UH...NO...That is part of the actual characters REAL Dialogue. :(I thought, well, the preview looked real good Maybe it gets better. UH..NO, Not Really. It has a few parts that were interesting and half-way decent, but UH...NO!SPOILER TIME:
Woman's husband bangs her head in wall (She is pregnant and was already having pains) She is bleeding profusely... He apologizes and goes to get ICE. She gets up off floor and locks him out and despite seeming to work as maybe a nurse, she goes to bed, doesn't call 911, doesn't try to go to hospital, doesn't even bandage her head or assess the damage other than seeing her hand soaked in BLOOD!Then after her husband is killed and she's attacked, she wakes up in hospital, her sister is there, whom obviously her jerk husband hasn't let her see in years because this is what abusive and controlling men do. Doctor's don't bother to tell sister that this is 3rd baby she has lost in 2 years, even though she is next of kin, and you guessed it, she lost the baby. :(After a few days, she goes home. REALLY. Refusing to stay with her sister, refusing to let sister stay with her, despite horrific husbands mangled body and attack on her few days earlier. WHY???? WHY???OH then she goes upstairs and see's something SPOOKY under flicker light post that goes OUT and she RUNs to Lock the DOORS of this big Creepy Victorian she lives in. REALLY??? A Guy killed your husband, tried to kill you, you lost your baby and YOU DIDN""T even LOCK ONE DOOR of this HUGE HOUSE at NIGHT???? :OThen they give us some filler KILLS, that are Quite Bloody and Super Violent and just a Splatter Fest, which I believe is what accounts for any High Ratings on this Site.OH, forgot to mention, The Acting was Atrocious, The Dialogue is HIdeous, The OVER use of EVERY old School, I""M an Idiot and don't know how to make any Good Decisions WHAT SO EVER to help me Survive this Maniac. And parts of the Special Effects of the Maniac, seem to have stolen Jeepers Creepers Duster Coat, The voice From Session 9, the Face from, Jeez can't remember and So it goes. You could probably make up a drinking game around this movie by predicting the horror trope and guessing what old horror movie certain elements were stolen from. And the Cops are Morons, who despite evidence, keep making ridiculous threats to the victim and her sister. And whom Never believe anything anyone says to them that makes sense.Also, the casting director must have been told in advance, pick nice looking people, but make sure NONE of them can Act their way out of a Paper Bag. And while your at it, Get me a Wanda Sykes wanna be, A 70's Fro Sista and an 80's Butch with a Mullet for the Prison scene. Ha hahahahaha And throw in a few 80's - 90's Chola's for good measure.One Good thing they showed was The Under Ground Seattle Tour, which is REAL and looks much better to Go to than watch this movie.We see flashbacks of main character who was adopted by sweet kind family and her scary antics growing up. But this Poor Couple is NEVER TOLD that many people have died VIOLENT GORY DEATHs around this child when she was younger than 8 years old. SOMEONE GET A LAWYER PLEASE!!! :OWe watch more people die, stupid cop chase the thing thru the underground Seattle and finally stumble upon it's lair and a kidnap victim, well victim 1st then lair.Then they lock up main character, while they investigate, not alone, in Gin Pop of a County Jail Cell. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid.Then little sis, does all this investigation of her big sister's past history in a matter of minutes, LOL, and then drives, ALONE at Night to BIG SCARY ABanDONED NuT HOUSE by the SEA (Which is a Very Cool Building) and goes in ALONE to search this Behemoth for old records of her sister as a kid. Any of you who watch Urban Explorers go into old hospitals know that It would be IMPOSSIBLE to find anything, Especially since, of course the Records Room is in Basement and all she has is her iphone to light her path. Ha ahahahahaha But MIRACLES of MIRACLES she finds it in minutes. :OMeanwhile, 80's Butch with Mullet and 70's Fro Sista give her a Beat DOWN in cell and NOT one cop comes to help, soon they are all Beating her to Death, and Yeah, you guessed it, that ugly thing POPS Out the Back of her Skull and starts RIPPING everyone Apart, While the 2 Bullies who started it fling cholla's and other stereotypical jail tropes, like prostitutes' and junkies at her. By the time Keystone Cop shows up at cell, Despite Ear Piercing Screaming and Mayham, and yes, ONLY 1 cop shows up. EVERYONE is DEAD and in Pieces EVERywhere!Then all the Cops are Mangled too, and Even Wanda Sykes cop and Stupid Detective trying to get laid are both Injured Pretty Bad. And take take opportunities to kill this thing before it's on them. SO.....YAWN....Little sis runs to hospital where kidnap victim is, and of course she is the REAL Mum of these monsters and was in a Coma She conveniently woke up for at this moment.They finally show us what I suspected ALL ALONG, as I did a Thesis 25 years ago in college on Vanished Twin Syndrome and Teratomas. Because I have always been interested in Strange and Horrible things. (Stephen King's --The Dark Half) also deals with parasitic twin/teratoma. That movies OLD. So another Wan Rip Off.Almost forgot, they show them at 1st emergency surgery trying to remove the twin, and just hacking away at an 8 year old with a bone saw from head to back at the spinal cord, no anesthesia and of course they all die. So Dr. Traps it and anesthetizes it and does a more proper surgery and CUTS THE CANCER OUT!!Then back at hospital, Mom apologizes to the monster and says it's her son, and should never have given him and his sister away. SAPPY and a BIT TOO LATE in my opinion considering the SKY HIGH BODY COUNT. And then the Main Female character EMILY, finally Drops her BALLS after like 30 years and uses them to over power her Evil, ugly, Teratoma, Parasitic Twin Gabriel. And lifts the hospital bed off her other sister who is dying pinned under it. And That was pretty much it. She locks Gabriel up in a Prison Cell, In the Windmills of her MIND. And then as she's with her sister and Mother saying she will Never let him control her again they fade back and we see a light at far bottom right of screen and it makes that buzzing flicker bulb sound (Yeah the one Gabriel always made before he appeared to kill people. So UH, 1st Question: I'm Pretty sure she's going to Jail or a Looney Bin for Rest of her life, unless Wan decides to make EVERYONE including the Courts Believe her when she says Gabriel did it all thru me and I'm Never letting him out of the Prison cell in my mind. Ha hahahaha And they do a Sequel. Ughhhhhhh.....
Almost forgot, Where were all her MASSIVE SCARS from top of head to base of spine as a kid when she was adopted. Pretty sure any Good adoptive parent would have notice that.This also used those flying techniques so it was basically: CROUCHING MONSTER, HIDDEN PARASITE.If this is your kinda movie, Then Please, Go on and Watch it. It has Plenty of Gore, if that's all your here for. It's Super Predicable, Awful Acting, Lazy Writing, I literally think I could pull a turd out of my cat box that could make a better story. BUT one thing that was COOL was the melting away of one Room into another, Every time Gabriel was killing people and invited sister Emily to witness it. The Cool Old house, and The Creepy Giant Nut House.. That's were It Earned 3 Points Rating from me. I Never Rate a 1 or 10 unless it is OVERALL WHOLLY DESERVED.Ok, you've Been Warned Now.

Unfortunately, his passion project only resonates with a fraction of those who are fans of his work.The film is a gruesome slash-fest that masquerades as a supernatural scarefest. Some of the scenes are unexpectedly stomach-churning to the point where you feel like you were swindled into watching a bad, low-budget B-movie (oh, wait...). And then there's the acting and dialogue. Some of the scenes feel like they were intentionally horribly written - is it possible this is some big joke and none of us are in on it?Worst of all, 'Malignant' is not entertaining.

I'm going to do my best to forget that James (The Conjuring!) Wan directed this unfocused hodge-podge nonsense.At first, I thought he was going for a supernatural Giallo style film with a dash of Inception. I was ready to be impressed. At about the 40-minute mark I became annoyed at the narrative. No attempt at coherent storytelling. Wan piles up set piece after set piece without explanation. If you were confused, you weren't alone.Then the females in jail scene...it all changed.Wan abandoned his vision and went full Frank Henenlotter, blending elements of Basket Case and Kuato from Total Recall. At this point, it became an unintentional comedy.He should have given Sam Raimi a call. Had this dummy movie been in the style of The Evil Dead, it would have been great...but he played the unabsorbed twin straight - AND gave it supernatural powers AND expected his audience to play along and take it seriously.This should have been a horror comedy from the outset.About those 10 Stars.

But before she could muster the courage to leave him, she gets pregnant. One night, on a particularly rough interaction, a coincidental visitor comes by.""---I (unironically) quite liked it! Not as a horror movie.. but as a Suspense/Mystery/Action/Thriller or sorts? I find it hard to categorize, because it's quite different from what I'm used to. Like a more violent ""Ghostbusters"" movie. Or an origin story in the vein of Shyamalan's ""Split"". And with a poster that screams ""B movie"".For one, I wasn't expecting some very interesting camera work from this movie.The top-down view of the house's rooms? Impressive. The editing (except for the falling lady), locations, visual effects (room transformations), transitions (a reverberating zoom-out) and scene compositions. It's a very well directed movie. And some very good acting from both Annabelle Wallis and Maddie Hasson, as they are great in their roles! And so is their adopted-mom. The rest of the case feels as if taken from one of those cheap Hallmark movies.The premise is also rather interesting. With a ""backwards killer"" with visually appealing and inventive movement, and a ""mental connection"" plot that doesn't really get there, but is an additional layer (instead of not having anything to offer). And a very interesting ""revelation"" at the end that works very well as motivation for the lead.Yet, the development of said conjecture is just.. bad in parts, confusing in others (until it kind of does) and gives the impression of being hurriedly stitched-together. Like a mash of different genres.And while it has very tense moments, decent music (pieces straight out of the ""Clock Tower"" game, and some that would have been better used somewhere else), it ultimately feels weird. Watch for the craft alone, and for being an overall fun (probably unintentionally) release!",Malignant
95,jamiedarlow-37510,Some elements work better than others!,5,17 October 2021,"Malignant is absolutely going to polarise its viewers which is part of what makes it such a fascinating one to talk about. I really want to give this a glowing review because of how admirably weird it gets in its second half. But I have to be honest, I came out underwhelmed. The two main reasons for this are firstly, that it changes tone very frequently between being goofy and having it's tongue firmly in its cheek to then going for the more predictable horror elements we're used to in a negatively disorientating way. Secondly, the central performance by Wallis; it's with a heavy heart to say that I found it shriekingly terrible to the point of being unwatchable which was a massive distraction from the enjoyment, even when keeping the campiness intended in mind.On a technical level, it has really impressive aspects such as the great stuntwork (Troy James' contortion work as Gabriel is massively entertaining) the score by Joseph Bishara (The Conjuring, Insidious) featuring an incredible theme in the opening titles, great production design and fantastic practical gore effects. Mckenna Grace's performance as the young Madison is magnetic. A certain reveal is absolutely insane and makes for a riveting 15 minute sequence in the finale. Gabriel is also an awesome character and will definately be inspiration for this Halloween's fancy dress!Despite the majority of his output not being my thing, I think James Wan is a great filmmaker and I can't wait to be as wowed by a movie he makes as I was with Death Sentence (2007) and Saw (2004). That 15 minute sequence is further proof of his exciting talent behind the camera.",Malignant
96,akshatmahajan,Just like James Wan's other movies,7,24 September 2021,"Malignant was entertaining to watch. The movie was combination of horror, drama and suspense. The movie starts being a horror one then turns to psychological drama but the transition is smooth.I don't know why this movie was not promoted properly otherwise this movie would have performed good at box office. The acting performances were good. Everyone played their parts nicely. The tone and environment setup was also good. Direction was also good, not strong. James Wan is known for horror movies and this movie is his first horror movie since 2016.The movie is getting mixed to positive reviews but I would suggest you to watch this movie and judge for yourself.

97,fciocca,"A fun watch, amazing transition from psychological horror into slasher.",7,30 September 2021,"James Wan delivered another good flick and my expectations for ""Malignant"" were greatly exceeded. This was genuinely funny and entertaining to watch. It starts off like a psychological horror, building up tension then, the film transitions smoothly into a slasher. There are well choreographed stunt action sequences and tons of gore. The movie never takes itself too seriously and this is why it succeeded greatly, at least for me. The story is simple and enjoyable: there is no convoluted subplot, just a straightforward script that reveals the mystery around the main character slowly. The movie had my undivided attention for almost two hours, the length is just perfect and it manages to close all the narrative arcs, leaving a small possibility for a sequel.Technically speaking the movie is amazing, photography is stunning. Wan used a lot of fish eyes lenses that better immersed me in some contexts. Camera movements, especially during the most dynamic moments are simple, and yet very efficient. Moreover, there are really interesting and creative shots. CGI is pretty good, however there are a couple of slightly unpolished details towards the end that left me a little bit down, nothing major though. The dark mood perfectly matches the plot and the soundtrack creates the right dose of tension and adrenaline. Acting was good enough, but no one really sparked, and I think that Annabelle Wallis could be better, considering that she plays the main character.""Malignant"" was definitely worth my time and it is a film that I have enjoyed a lot.

director: James Wan
starring: Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young, Michole Briana White, Ray Chase.Madison is paralyzed by shocking visions of grisly murders, and her torment worsens as she discovers that these waking dreams are in fact terrifying realities. What an absolutely insane experience Malignant was, I loved it!My first few positives would be the cinematography, gore, and sound design. As well as the creative idea and fantastic set locations. And also, the great building of tension and Jumpscares. This film was one of the most visually creative things I have seen. The use of red was excellent. And the camera angles were unique and used well to create tension or a different perspective to the scarier scenes. High angle shots and panning especially was used very effectively and it felt very immersive. The film was incredibly gory, and I loved it. It was very over the top which was the films intension and even I had to look away in parts where the film dialled the gore up to a one hundred, but it added a lot more impact to the scenes and James Wan wasn't afraid to go all out. What I also really liked was the films sound design, the film really went all out with grossing out the audience, with bones cracking and the brutal stabbing noises whenever a kill happened, I also thought the soundtrack itself really added a great cinematic and different feel to the film and was a great asset. The idea itself was also very clever, it took inspiration from campy 80's horror but the film had a modern twist to it. I have never experienced a film like this before, so I must tip my hat to James Wan as this film was unique and not like anything else. I also thought the set locations for this film was incredible. This film really built its story world excellently with some creative sets that were perfect for the desired tone and for the jump-scare scenes and they were really incorporated into the film. I also thought the building of tension and Jumpscares were so well done. James Wan is the master of crafting intense scenes for Jumpscares, he plays cleverly with genre tropes and always builds the tension to the max and teases the audience to keep you on edge for as long as possible.My next few positives would be the balance of tones, character depth and emotional weight. As well as the good mystery and development to the plot. I loved how Malignant managed to balance its different tones excellently. The film often had a very dark and gruesome tone and went to some messed up and sinister places, but the film balanced this with a fun, campy and silly tone that worked excellently, I could really see what James Wan was trying to do and for me it worked brilliantly. I also think this film had a surprisingly strong amount of character depth and emotional weight in parts. The main character Madison (Annabelle Wallis) went through a lot of trauma with losing her baby multiple times, and how her partner treated her and blamed her for losing the baby gave her as a character a great amount of depth and sympathy for her. And the emotional weight the film achieved with the more grounded and personal scenes between Madison and her sister was a great element. I also really liked the great mystery and development to the plot. This film had such a great mystery surrounding Gabriel and his origins, it took the film down and unexpected path and always kept me guessing what was going to happen, it certainly wasn't predictable, and I loved the murder mystery side to it as well. The plot also developed really well from the mystery, the film was really well written, and everything slowly started to make more sense as things were revealed, with the connected deaths and Madison's past starting to connect with each other.My only slight negative would be that it was slightly too over the top in places. I fully embraced how campy and over the top the film was, and it was a strong element to the film. However, there were a couple of scenes that felt too over the top and dramatic without needing to be and felt more forced than a lot of the film.My final few positives would be the performances, humour, insane plot twists and excellent final act. As well as the great character design for Gabriel. I thought the performances here were strong. Were they over the top and silly yes, but that's what they were supposed to be so the whole cast did a great job. Especially Annabelle Wallis who did a fantastic job with a very demanding role. I also liked the humour in the film. It was very self-aware and made fun of itself in particular scenes which I found refreshing. I also loved the character design for Gabriel. The design was genuinely disturbing but very inventive. He had hair similar hair to Madison's and the grotesque face was very graphic, and the way Gabriel moved backwards and in reverse for everything was a mixture of terrifying and creative when it came to the action. I thought the plot twist in the final act was one of the most insane things I have ever seen. It connected everything together and took the film in a crazy and unpredictable direction. Having Gabriel be a parasite attached to Madison that controls her was very messed up but lead to one of the most gruesome and entertaining final acts I have ever seen, and it was an experience I won't be forgetting.Overall, James wan asserts himself as one of the greats. Malignant is a silly, campy and over the top masterpiece of horror, that is very reminiscent of the 80's. This was one of the most inventive and unique horrors I have seen and an experience I won't be forgetting for a very long time.Overall score 98/100.",Malignant

103,movieman6-413-929510,"James Wan makes a comeback with an interesting idea, but lacks elaboration and originality.",5,4 September 2021,"Malignant is a new horror thriller directed in part written and produced by James Wan, the director of The Conjuring and Insidious.In the film, Madison (Annebelle Wallis) suffers separate torments, in which she sees visions of murders being committed. Madison thinks she suffers from strange nightmares, but when she learns that the people in her visions really died, she shares her story with her sister. Together they decide to inform the police, but are not really taken seriously here. When Madison discovers that the victims are all related to her childhood, she tries to find possible new victims. With this she tries to inform the police to prevent new victims, but the mysterious killer always seems to be one step ahead of her.With this film, James Wan makes a comeback as a horror director, because since 2016 he has chosen to direct other genre films. Although he is also known for directing these films, he remains more of a creative expert with how he directs his horror films. For example, he makes you as a viewer of this film in doubt from the beginning about what kind of horror film you will see.For this film, James Wan co-wrote the story with his wife Ingrid Bisu and Aleka Cooper, who is more known for writing TV episodes. The fact that his co-writers are on the novice side is unfortunately reflected in the story of this film. They come up with an interesting idea, but unfortunately this idea lacks a clear implementation. James Wan portrays the horror aspects well where the visions of the main character change space in a beautiful way.Apart from the idea, this film lacks unique horror moments, because many moments from this film are somewhat copied from other James Wan horror films or other classics. It can be entertaining for horror fans to recognize some of these moments, but ultimately the film lacks original horror moments of its own. The moments can also seem a bit predictable to horror connoisseurs due to this lack. For lead actress Annabelle Wallis, this is her second time in a horror film produced by James Wan. She starred in the 2014 horror film from the Conjuring series Annabelle. She didn't come out that strong in this film, but this film was also directed by a lesser director. Fortunately, under the direction of James W, she comes out a bit better. Sometimes she delivers certain reactions in a way that is too exaggerated. This allows you as a viewer to be taken out of the story and you realize again that you are watching a movie. To better convey the film, they could have cast another actress for the lead role. The rest of the film cast delivers appropriate acting, but thanks to the script, their characters sometimes make separate decisions that can make the film less believable.",Malignant

I understand the reviews that call this campy. But I don't understand enjoying that experience. It feels like someone stupider than you lying in your face and expecting you to believe and back them up. It's just insulting.

Until one night mysteriously her husband ends up being murdered and Madison's begins to be plagued with numerous horrific visions. This movies tone and premise rest on the fact whether do you know anything about Stephen king. If you do you're not gonna notice and think it's original idea and enjoy the movie unbothered. However if you're observant to the opening scene and the dialogue Madison gives in beginning. You pretty much know exactly what the movie's about what's going on and where it's going. The film doesn't feel like a sleep feast or chore to get through, it keep you invested in the story. While still offers plenty of good shots and visuals specifically the blend in between visions and the brutal gore. It's honestly not scary or suspenseful. It's The Characters for most aren't really that interesting with the exception of Madison. Madison's the only one giving focus as the film builds around her situation. The sister and the cops really doesn't go anywhere with them other then misdirection and disbelief until the the third act when it's revealed what's really going on. The tone the film also clearly trying to pay tribute state to 80s horror. Trying to be quirky& campy but, it doesn't really feel right when it's clearly modern times and your talking about a abused miscarraiage women They try to make it somewhat relevant with Madison like she's listening to like an old radio but there's a flatscreen TV on the wall. The kills are fun over the top to the point it does come off as kinda
funny. There's a prison scene which great want happens with women one dress look like an 80s punk rocker with mullet quite possibly a nod to lesbian culture of the time. The choice of music that's throughout this whole movie. It probably should've just been set in the 80s.

107,darkreignn,"You will not expect what ""Malignant"" offers",7,14 September 2021,"James Wan, acclaimed director of ""The Conjuring,"" ""Saw,"" and ""Insidious"" makes his anticipated horror return with ""Malignant."" Proving to be quite the master of supernatural horror, Wan seems to be making a return to form here - at least, that's what the trailer of ""Malignant"" would have you expect.Without spoiling anything, I can guarantee you that this movie will completely subvert your expectations, for better or for worse. And in the case of this movie, is not giving audiences what they expect something to be applauded, or does the intentionally misleading marketing do the film a disservice? Right off the bat, ""Malignant"" is bizarre. The beginning sequence is so campy that I legitimately thought it was a joke opening that the movie would reveal to be some sort of meta commentary on cheesy horror films. The dialogue, content, and performances in this sequence seem intentionally over the top, and thus, do not do a good job of scaring or clueing the audience in as to what they can look forward to. After this part, the opening credits begin, and you're introduced to our main characters - and again, the cheesy dialogue and campy acting return. To put it lightly, I was flabbergasted at what I was watching. This was directed by James Wan, wasn't it? The man who gets dedicated, passionate performances out of his actors during even the most ridiculous of plots? What did I get myself in to?After about 45 minutes where this same formula of cheesiness followed, I started to understand what kind of movie ""Malignant"" was. This movie does not contain neither the horror or the drama of ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring."" Instead, ""Malignant"" feels more like watching a very polished, high production value made for TV film. At times it is so bizarre that it starts to feel like a telenovela. Your enjoyment of the movie, and the amount of entertainment value that you obtain from this film completely hangs in the balance of whether or not you jive with this tone. Once I realized the type of movie I sat down to watch, I understood that no amount of regret or confusion would somehow magically change this into the hardcore horror film I expected. So instead, I just started to go with the flow, and was rewarded by a pretty fun time at the movies.""Malignant"" is a B-movie through and through; this is a goofy, goofy movie that was made not to scare, but to entertain. The acting isn't good. The dialogue isn't good. But the direction? It's good. The cinematography? It's really good. The music? It feels very misplaced, but it's good. James Wan committed himself entirely to one of the most ridiculous, insane mainstream films I've ever seen, and it's actually pretty fun. If you're a gore hound, you'll for sure be satisfied here because the movie packs a bloody punch. James Wan flexes his action skills in an incredible third act sequence featuring some of the best choreographed violence I've seen since ""Nobody."" The plot goes to places so insane that you'll literally be saying, ""What the fudge"" out loud in the theatre. There are also some really visually pleasing sequences (that you've seen in the trailer) that make for cool, eerie viewing. There honestly is a lot to enjoy here, if you can just get past how silly the movie is.""Malignant"" is not what you're expecting - and now that you know that, I hope that you're able to sit down, relax, and have a little bit of fun with it.

Its themes of family, abuse, and trauma rarely materialize into something meaningful.The lack of true scares may be a deal-breaker for some. And indeed, the overall outlandishness at work on the screen is going to flat-out annoy certain viewers. But then there will be those who revel in the audacity of Malignant.

110,TheCorniestLemur,A real head-scratcher,5,10 October 2021,"Well, um...this is certainly one to revisit at some point.Malignant is a strange beast to review for me. It's one of those films where you won't really know how you feel about it until you've seen it twice, and even worse, I can't really say why. That would be spoilers. Big ones.So for all you know, everything I'm about to say could be complete rubbish, but all I can tell you is how I experienced this film. What Malignant was to me is almost an entire film of incredibly boring and generic horror with a flailingly inconsistent tone that jumps around from everything to cheesy Sam Raimi style camp, to James Wan's Conjuring films, to a cheesy but not exactly camp 80s horror. The acting isn't anything special, the narrative was extremely dull, and while there were a few good shots here and there, most of the time it didn't look all that interesting either.And then, in the last 20 minutes, it smacks you with one of the best twists I've seen in ages and goes full camp, almost to the point it becomes an action film in those last few scenes, and while the ending makes it pretty disappointing and cheesy in a bad way in my opinion, I might go as far as to say that it makes the whole film worth it. I didn't particularly enjoy watching it up until then, but a) a lot of people really love this film so I could never tell you whether you would or not, b) it really is that good that I didn't regret watching the whole thing, and c), knowing where the film is going might make it a much better experience whenever I decide to rewatch it.It's an odd specimen for sure, but no matter how I feel about it now or in the future, you should definitely watch it. I'm not joking when I talk about how great that twist is, and even better, having thought about it a lot since watching this, I don't think the twist made anything retroactively not make sense. Do you have any idea it is to find a film with a twist like this that doesn't end up punching a minefield of holes in its own script?It's really goddamn rare, and I can pretty much guarantee that even if you don't end up thinking the film is ultimately all that, like me, you will at least appreciate what it's building towards.",Malignant

I especially love his horror classics that he directed and the franchises he started (Insidious,Annabelle,Conjuring, Lights Out Etc) most of all the installments he specifically helmed & directed. You can't take every plot point in this movie so seriously as a viewer, think of old cheesy horror movies that we all loved growing up. All of the iconic ones all had some campy, cheesy elements at some point in their films. But it didn't make them less scary. In my opinion, this is no different! Honestly I really liked it, there was high tension the entire time. While I figured out some aspects of the plot during the film, you couldn't really predict all of the finale. Great acting by Annabelle Wallis as always, loved her in Annabelle. And nice to see a cameo by McKenna Grace! I love that James Wan took a new type of horror story and really got creative with it. A little bit of Lights Out, Insidious, Unborn, Mortal Kombat... Some sci-fi elements and cinematography that even reminded me of some Pensive scenes from Harry Potter. My millennials know what I'm talking about!!! I've been so let down by movies ALL year. Every single one has felt short. But I can usually count on James Wan to bring it home.

I have given them all at least a 7 out of 10. This is the first one that has been complete garbage.The acting is bad. The writing is lazy. The story is boring. Not scary.

Whether you get on board the strange, campy, Giallo-like tone of the film will affect how much you get into it, as well as looking past some iffy writing and nonsensical stuff just to be a bit different and kind of a throwback to older Slashers.The acting seems to be going for a bit of cheese and its soundtrack is weird. The killer itself is a blank slate and whether you like the reveal or not is going to affect it. The film also has some cool shots in places too.To give credit, this feels like a movie James Wan knew what he wanted to make and I think he does get the results he wants. That being said, there were quite a lot of typical Horror cliches and the movie is never really scary. The tone especially in the last act seems polarising. It looks cool, but doesn't really feel like Horror. There's some good body horror stuff and kills here and there, but the story didn't really suck me in that much and I was a bit bored.

On the one hand, we have a series of mysterious murders, on the other hand, we have a woman who has strange visions and sees the murders as if she was there, but without being able to move at all. Everything started after a strong hit to her head that her violent partner caused to her. What exactly ""woke up"" after this hit? What happened to her since then? What is this dark evil that follows her since she was a child and now is awakened again? A really uncommon scenario inspired by an extremely rare and unusual idea that is slow to reveal to viewers. The whole story and the set-up try to confuse the watchers's mind, leaving room for other, more ordinary horror scenarios. However, this idea is extremely rare and it is very difficult to suspect this even with an experienced viewer. An extreme case that can happen in real world, however, here is greatly enhanced and although the case is based on something rare but realistic, there is plenty of imagination and a combination of rareties to reach the edges. What is this pure and powerful evil, this ""malignant"" that follows this woman so many years? Plenty of mystery and suspense, quite good performances and excellent effects that will hold the viewer's attention throughout the movie! A highly unusual and extreme scenario combined with a peculiar direction, in a special film that gives its own unique character and style to the genre of horror films. It is more than just the top horror movie of the year. It is a category by itself, a movie that can inspire other ones in the future, a new reference movie that comes out once in 10 years! The director of SAW, The Conjuring and Insidious from past decades, brings out the Malignant, the horror movie of the decade and a new ""MUST"" for all fans of the genre!!!

And it just got worse, however it became so incredibly terrible in the last half hour that it became funny, though I'm sure that was its intentions, though I have no idea what this film's intentions are besides making money and sadly, it probably will in some way. It is terribly acted, it is terribly written and it is one of the worst things I've seen in a long time. I didn't realize who the director was and I have nothing nice to say, but based upon what I have seen I will say that it's good that he produces much more than he directs. However, I will say that his first film, Saw, was truly one of the most shocking films I'd ever seen at that time and it was as effective & horrific as the director wanted to be. Malignant is just pure sloppy filmmaking and very badly made schlock. I must admit to being surprised by one scene in the latter part that is key to the film that I did not see coming, but that doesn't mean it was good. That is when it started to get funny.

130,hunter-friesen,"""Malignant"" is Matter over Mind",6,17 September 2021,"When talking about the most popular and influential horror films of this century, James Wan's name pops up on more than one occasion. Spawning the ""Saw"" franchise in 2004, Wan illustrated his knack for scary thrills doused in buckets of blood. He would tone things down to a PG-13 rating for the first two installments in the ""Conjuring"" and ""Insidious"" series. He made sure to prove that he wasn't just a one-trick pony as he lent his kineticism to ""Furious 7"" and ""Aquaman"" (and the upcoming sequel). But after helming several $200 million productions, Wan has gone back to his horror roots with ""Malignant.""Madison is pregnant and living with her abusive husband - the kind that won't hesitate to bash her head against the wall when he doesn't get his way. One night, the couple's house is broken into, leading to the gruesome deaths of the husband and Madison's unborn child. Her trauma doesn't end there as she begins to have vivid nightmares of the killer striking down other prey. It becomes clear that these nightmares are visions, as Madison is paranormally linked to the masked killer, as they share a connection dating back to their childhood in a now-abandoned research hospital. In a race against time, Madison must piece together the past and convince the skeptical police before more lives are taken.When announcing production on this film, Wan claimed that it would be nothing like his previous horror films, which relied on jump-scares and the occult to convey his version of dread. Instead, ""Malignant"" would take influence from the Italian horror sub-genre of ""Giallo"", which reached its heights in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with films such as Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" (delightfully remade by Luca Guadagnino in 2018) and Mario Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace."" These films were defined by their mystery elements, intense color palettes, disregard for logic, and sickening violence.Wan commits fully to his Giallo promise, delivering grisly murders and an outrageous plot that must be seen to believe. Wan's camera never lingers for more than a moment. Rather, it whips and pans as we are right with Madison witnessing these unseemly events. It keeps the plot moving at a steady pace, with the last act picking up momentum towards a bloody conclusion.While he made good on his Giallo promise, Wan doesn't fully commit to breaking away from his overproduced previous features. The earlier sequences of ""Malignant"", particularly the home invasion, are carbon copies of Wan's earlier work as characters shuffle around a dimly lit house as they hear creepy noises, only for it to conclude with a jump scare. This modern trope builds a wall between the film's two halves, with the former stuck in the present and the latter embellishing the past.The acting and writing in ""Malignant"" fall way down in the priority list, with Wan's direction overtaking all. There is no development for any of these characters, except for a pointless lab technician who has the hots for the handsome detective. Given not much to do besides delivering exposition and crafting some semblance of humanity, the actors are free of blame for their faults.But what the script lacks in quality, it makes up for in originality as it tells a ludicrously bonkers story that has been sorely lacking from this genre. There is a cult-classic feeling to this story, one that may find more appreciation down the road.James Wan's ""Malignant"" is a melding of modern horror tropes with classic horror lunacy. There's enough blood and guts to make even the most seasoned horror veteran wince, and a shockingly outlandish story to pave over the film's other faults. You may not fully enjoy the film, but you will never forget the experience of watching it.",Malignant

132,FKDZ,Wan,7,26 September 2021,"Malignant is a bit of a interesting mix. The general story and concept is a bit crazy, but it's James Wan and I didn't expect anything else. It still has his classic style of intro and music choice. But it also has its flaws.First off, the directing and cinematography was fantastic. There were some fantastic shots and great one takes. Overall the movie flowed really well.Thankfully, unlike other Wan movies it doesn't have a excessive amount of color grading turning everything gaudy and plain ugly (based on dead silence, insidious and saw).The acting, its.. probably one of the major letdowns. The main actress is fine for basic scenes, but any that require any sort of strong emotion are just not working. She just can't sell it somehow and it made all her screams and emotion feel kind of odd. Outside of the main actress the acting is fine, though nothing special.The story, yep, it's weird. But with horror I'd rather have weird these days than traditional stuff. Aside from the finale where I thought things went a bit unexplained it was entertaining.The monster can be hilarious at times, well, mostly actually. At first it's scary and you can't see it's face. Just the long hair. But once it was revealed it's just looked funny. Though I appreciate the practical effects work (and some meh cgi) the concept of it isn't scary. I guess even they knew because the monster needed a all black hot topic styled gothic outfit.Now about the mix, the first half of the movie is rather creepy and what you'd expect from a horror/thriller. But the second half just becomes a action slasher and has a incredible scene(s) at the police station. I loved that. The kills in this are VERY well done, I loved pretty much everything, they are satisfying, gore-y and gruesome.I personally expected a bit more scare, especially with such great directing, but it stil ended up being a fun movie.",Malignant

142,hoernkeem,"Malignant (2021, James Wan) Wan brings a strange and original new vision to the horror genre",7,25 October 2021,"'Malignant' is a horror film from James Wan who made his name making modern iconic horror with 'Saw', 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious' before moving on to helm larger fare in the Fast & Furious franchise and 'Aquaman'. Here Wan returns to his horror roots helming a film based on a story by him and his wife Ingrid Bisu. The story stems from the urban legend of Edward Mordrake who I had never heard of. The only real name talent in front of the camera is Annabelle Wallis who has a connection to Wan as she stared in 'Annabelle' which was spawned from Wan's Conjuring-verse.In the early 90's we have a scene unfold at a gothic looking mental facility. Here a patient turns violent and kills numerous staff members. We get the impression that the patient is a child and some sort of telepath/telekinetic. We never see the patient as they sedate it claiming it is time to ""cut the cancer out"". We then flash forward to modern day where Madison Lake, played by Wallis, is pregnant and living with an abusive husband. One night he attacks her slamming her head into the wall. She barricades herself in her room, and has troubled dreams of an intruder. She awakes and finds her husband gruesomely murdered and the killer still in the house. She is attacked and when she awakes in a hospital she has lost her baby. She begins having more vivid dreams of people dying and she informs the police who are finding these bloody murder scenes. Some think she is behind the killings while others think she is just a lunatic starved for attention. Madison goes on to discover that she is adopted. The tension continues to ratchet up, and you can tell this is all leading to some bizarre conclusion/revelation and that Madison has some larger role in all these events, but when the reveal comes I must admit I didn't see it coming. I speculated that a few things could be true, and ultimately my speculations were kind of true, but not in any way I imagined. With the killer ultimately revealed it is a pretty quick process to subdue the killer and return life to some semblance of normality for Madison although, as with most horror movies, a huge door was left open for the killer's possible/eventual reappearance.James Wan certainly knows how to produce and direct a good, effective horror movie. This movie has a good, creepy feel from the outset. It establishes a good mystery as well as some gruesome violence throughout the narrative. This did not feel like a visual effects heavy film, but the visuals are great throughout used strategically to create the ominous horror mood, choreographed violence, chase sequences and even just the basic sets and how the characters saw things. It was all really good stuff. This is one of those rare movies that I had no data on going into it and thus was able to truly enjoy it unfold with no preconceived notion from trailers or reviews or other discussion. When the final reveal comes some may roll their eyes and consider it too crazy and outlandish but I though it was great cause it was something original that I hadn't seen depicted before and half the battle with movies like this is creating something original. For that alone even if the movie was a dismal failure it would deserve some credit. On the contrary though I found this to be a taut, tense horror thriller that created something new and interesting injecting vitality into what can often be a stale genre.Eric's Grade: B.",Malignant

147,theredsky,Malignant Review,4,9 October 2021,"A film that I would like a lot more if it didn't feel like it wanted to be a serious horror film. That's my biggest issue with this. Sometimes it feels like it's homaging the shock value horror films of the 70s and 80s and sometimes it feels like it's trying to be a serious horror film. If it was going for that first one, then they did a terrible job at trying to present it that way. If it had just stuck with that tone, then the score for this would be much higher. James Wan's visual style is definitely on point here. The camerawork is great and the transition of visual effects between scenes looks great. It's the story here that is the problem. It's incredibly nonsensical and I can't tell if it's trying to be like that or not. The performances are fine. No one is doing anything outstanding although you can tell that some performances are very over the top which I did like. I didn't think there was an awful performance though. The use of gore is kind of cool sometimes but the action scenes are hilariously nonsensical. There is one Police Station action scene that is hilariously bad. The film being enjoyable is another compliment I can give it. I was definitely having a blast watching this one. The plot twist at the end is what showed me the two conflicting ideas for this. It's hilarious and awkward and I think that's what it's going for but the rest of the film takes itself so seriously that I can't tell if that's what it was trying to do. If you want a weird, campy, and hilariously bad horror film then I would definitely recommend this but I would suggest watching it with friends like I did.",Malignant
148,el7,It's a giallo!,7,11 September 2021,"But is it a successful giallo? It's got a lot of the hallmarks of 80's era giallo lovingly recreated: beautiful primary colors all over the screen, a setting with lots of inherent mystery, hidden histories gothically rendered, a heroine who might be going out of her mind, lots of tense chase sequences, a baroque murder weapon, a synth soundtrack with lots of woozy flourishes, stylish push-in shots, and dream logic galore! I'd say as an homage it's very successful. But that raises another question: is giallo relevant for the 21st century moviegoer?Stylistically, I think it can be. This film is certainly beautiful to look at. Tropewise I think it could be. I enjoyed the hell out of the whodunit plot, and I really liked the grand guignol set pieces. The characters were likable and the settings enjoyably creepy. I do think the split personality villain has been overdone at this point in time and any future conveyors of the genre might want to retire that trope. I also suspect 21st century audiences don't have much patience for unexplained bizarre plot elements. I'd be lying if I didn't admit to laughing at a key moment when a face appears where no face would appear on an anatomically correct human. Silly plot twists aren't a deal-breaker for me personally, but I know my love of such developments is not shared by all.All in all it's not the best giallo I've ever seen, and I'm not convinced that it's the giallo that's going to bring the genre into its next renaissance, but I liked it and I'll probably watch it again.",Malignant

159,BeanieCore,"A stylish, gonzo love-letter to retro horror.",7,15 September 2021,"It's been a long time since a horror film this bonkers, surreal and unapologetically old-school was given the big screen treatment. But while those wanting more pseudo-sequels to Wan's ""Insidious"" or ""Conjuring"" franchises may be disappointed, fans of 80's horror, slashers and gore films will be overjoyed with this tongue in cheek homage to all things gonzo. ""Malignant"" seemed to drop out of nowhere, and it's marketing is deceptive enough that the first half of the film will successfully lull it's audience into expecting another helping of cliched, over-saturated supernatural horror. Instead, Wan has given us the most stylish, purely fun big-screen B horror in a long time. And, personally, this horror fanatic is living for it.Though the tone of the film is somber and serious, viewers will need to suspend their disbelief to go along for the ride. Horror, as a genre, is always dealing with fictional, fantastical creatures, entities and such, so suspension of logic is something we have to do with most horror flicks. But this one in particular, is so over the top, that if it's ""supernatural logic"" is picked apart too closely, it begins to raise questions. It's made this way on purpose, and if one can set aside their expectations of real-world logic for a few hours, they'll have great fun. The cast is not exceptional, but they do well enough with the material they're given, and the characters are imbued with just enough personality to be likeable. Meanwhile, Wan's direction is slick, energetic and stylish. The film's cinematography calls to mind the colorful giallo films of the 1970's, and Wan still has the touch of a master when the film slows down for it's more suspenseful moments.It's easy for any seasoned horror veteran to predict the ""twist"" from almost the beginning, but this is another way in which Wan lulls his audience into false expectations, as the final 20 minutes deliver another minor revelation, and the film switches gears from a menacing, stylish slasher, into a hyperactive explosion of gore. It's all incredibly surreal, disturbing and occasionally, blackly humorous. The narrative is also composed of bits and pieces from various cult-classics, but given a modern spin that keeps them fresh. The filmmakers very intentionally wanted to give us an unexpected, high-octane roller coaster of a horror flick, and they succeed with flying colors. It may not be an ingenious, thoughtful film, but it's a big, dumb fun one, and it knows it. As long as you do as well, you'll have tons of fun with it.",Malignant
160,Wililjam,Another movie plagued by a bad ending...,7,29 October 2021,"This movie, up until the ending was actually pretty solid. There were some moments where characters didn't do stuff that any sane human would do, such as walk into dark parts of corridors etc. Haven't they watched any scary movie ever?The thing that REALLY pissed me off was the ending, and the feeling of emptyness it gave. It was nice to see Madison get her body back, but did the police officer survive? What happened after, was she convicted of murdering like 50 police officers? What about the mother, didn't Madison want to say hi or something? So many questions left unanswered.It was a good movie, up until the ending. 6.5/10.",Malignant

And as it kind of plodded through the first two acts, I thought to myself, ""Aw man, another 'imaginary friend' movie. Well, let's see how it plays out.""And then the third act hit and I was RIVETED to the screen, laughing and enjoying the whole spectacle. It was FUN!I honestly don't know how many people are going to like this movie. I'm not even sure how to recommend it. I mean, if you're a horror fan, you HAVE to check this thing out, but I think people who like crime dramas will like it, too. I will say that you have to be a little patient with it.

James Wan has time and again explained this is not Conjuring or Insidious. It's really hard to describe this movie but think of it as hybrid of Matrix + Evil Dead? Even then I am nowhere close.The first half really tests your patience. It looks like it's a serious film that we have seen time and again, like minority report but in horror setting but post interval it makes a U turn and shows its true self and if you've been watching this with seriousness, expecting a scary horror movie then it is your fault. The opening scene should give you a hint of what it's going to be like.I am so glad they didn't casted someone like Amanda Wallace. Though she looks like an ordinary girl in the picture, it wouldn't have worked otherwise. There is plenty gore and practical effects that takes you back to 80s.It's even better on second viewing. I am glad James Wan exists and he's such a name in horror industry that he can make bold movies like this which you can't describe without giving anything away. Watch it and keep your serious brain aside.",Malignant
164,joker-4,Entertaining for James Wan's legion of fans,6,15 September 2021,"James Wan knows how to make a movie look good. Be it a high-end blockbuster like Aquaman or the creepy and intimate Conjuring, his films are slick and exciting and entertaining. Malignant is certainly no different and Wan fans should rejoice. From clever jump scares and unreliable fugue states to strange flashbacks and the snap-crackle-pop of breaking bones, Malignant is fun, weird, and, yes, entirely ridiculous. As great as Wan can craft a movie, many times his scripts severely detract from true greatness. Aquaman, for all its flash and splash, was truly terrible. Malignant, although leaning more into the world of the Conjuring, was not much better.Wan's talents build the more he directs. Look at the level of craftsmanship between the first two Conjuring movies, as an example. The Conjuring was tight and dusty and shadowy while the sequel jumped into blockbuster action with dissolving backdrops, believable levitation, and painful possession. Malignant is terrifyingly beautiful to view. The rain-washed setting of Seattle was perfect for a tale of mystery and misplaced revenge. The shadows here are dark and deep. The camera swings around bleeding memory into reality. Lights flicker. Sounds echo. This is horror at its finest.Once the true threat is revealed, unfortunately, the remainder becomes merely comical. Gothic horror gives way to comic book action and the movie quickly disintegrates. All the make-up and f/x and monster-movie reverb sadly cannot elevate this one from the basest of tropes.Malignant is sure to excite and entertain James Wan's legion of fans. The f/x are cutting edge and the cinematography is a showcase of high-end horror cinema. Like Aquaman before it, the story goes off the deep end and never recovers. This creepy, solemn feature escalates into a superhero movie with a pitiful excuse of a resolution.",Malignant
165,BijeshNagesh,Cunning Horror Mish-Mash,7,13 September 2021,"Whatever praise you can heap on James Wan, be sure to heap the praise that he's one of the few directors out there who can expertly apply 'fright psychology' techniques through a cinema-lens. You'll see a lot of clever and cunning elements of the sort in ""Malignant"", which I saw in theatres over the weekend.It was bad enough the air-con was turned off longer than it should be - not gonna name theatre-names - but the chill in the air came from the silver screen. There were more than a handful of 'classic horror' scenes and sequences - inspirations, not replications. ""Malignant"" packed a good many threads of unoriginal horror-plotlining, but it used the best of classic scary-movie cinema and set it in a contemporary frame.Akela Cooper's story and screenplay worked sorcery in combination with James Wan and Ingrid Bisu's story design for ""Malignant"". Whoever put Joseph Bishara in charge of musical scoring made one heckuva great decision. So much of this film relied on his masterful tune-skills. No scene was left untouched or uninfluenced by his 'layered' compositional technique.As for Michael Burgess's cinematography, let me just say the man has a way with angles and lighting that make you intentionally choose not to blink lest you miss something. That continuous vertical sequence following the lead actress (Annabelle Wallis) running inside the house was something to behold.Good art and set decoration by David Scott and Jennifer M. Gentile, respectively. Lisa Norcia's costume design complemented a lot of key moments in this movie, which is also concurrently streaming on HBO Max (the ad-free subscription).Great work on stunts and special effects as well. Both the teams added crucial detailing and value to several significant scenes in 2021 ""Malignant"".Madison Mitchell (played by Annabelle Wallis) carried the movie superbly. Her performance was great, and evoked the spirit of Shelley Duvall's Wendy Torrance from ""The Shining"" (1980). Madison's dreams were actually dark reflections of simultaneous real-time occurrences that end in someone's murder.Derek Mitchell (played by Jake Abel) was good at being the 'bad husband'. On a serious note, domestic abuse is real, and someone you know (personally or in passing) has most certainly experienced it. It was strangely satisfying watching Derek be the first to die in the movie.James Wan's use of a 'parasitic twin' - Madison's 'half' Gabriel, voiced by Ray Chase and physically performed by Marina Mazepa - was as creepy as it was unnerving. It was even creepier to learn that it fed off Madison's foetuses (hence her multiple miscarriages) to 'build' itself.Detectives Kekoa Shaw (played by George Young) and Regina Moss (played by Michole Briana White) gave interesting 'filler' performances.How James Wan twisted an unoriginal 'been there seen that' concept into a frightfully good movie that contained few dull moments or blunt edges is beyond me. The film failed to fit into any one mould or type. Wan generously tapped into an 'anything goes' style and he, incredibly, pulled it off.The gripping and frightening final 25 minutes of the film - jail cell blood-bath, police precinct massacre, hospital room final-faceoff - need to be seen to be appreciated. There's also plenty of script-room for a potential sequel.The director of ""Malignant"", James Wan, cleverly took little bits of horror-inspirations from various scary film titles and put them together (almost like Tarantino) into this 'latest' horror film that will appeal to 'young and modern' audiences. ""Malignant"" is one of the best horror flicks you'll see in 2021 that captures horror tropes that have come and gone over the decades.",Malignant

Something made with the experience of two decades of film making and leting it culminate in some fresh and not familiar scares right in time for Halloween.Wan delivers, and so does Gabriel.Go watch it.

171,RMurray847,One crazy story...wish the acting had kept up,6,13 September 2021,"The plot of MALIGNANT is nuts. I truly can't tell you too much about it without spoiling things, and the spoilers are what would make you realize just how bats**t crazy some of the goings-on are. The film begins in 1993, in a ""institution"" (where the establishing shot immediately makes you understand that this is a place living on the fringes of legit science). A test subject has gone berserk and the entire staff is afraid for their lives and careers. With a cryptic utterance by the head doctor of ""It's time to cut out the cancer"", we jump forward to present day. There we meet Madison, a pregnant woman of around 30, who is in an abusive relationship with husband Derek, and when that abuse is manifested, BAD things happen.And bad things continue to happen, and poor Madison seems to tapped into the mind of this malignant force, because she starts seeing murders happening as though she were in the room. Needless to say, this is very upsetting to her, as is the response of the understandably skeptical Seattle police dept. Things spiral from there and I will say that director James Wan keeps raising the tension very effectively, culminating in some truly over-the-top (in a good way) scenes near the end.The movie is violent and gory. It's also blessedly not afraid to just let rip with its completely outrageous plot that includes some twists you'll see coming and a few you won't.So far, so good...right? (If gory horror isn't your thing, then skip MALIGNANT. But for those of us who don't mind if it's in service to a good story...yay!)The biggest problem is that almost everyone in the film delivers pretty lousy performances. Some of the dialogue is certainly pretty cheesy, and sometimes character motivation isn't spelled out the best...but honestly, that's no excuse for the pretty poor acting. Lead Annabelle Wallis certainly looks great in the role...haggard and hollow-eyed. But we get no real sense of her as a person rather than plot device, as emotionally she just bounces all over the place. She has many scenes with Maddie Hasson as her sister, and Ms. Hasson is really quite lost. Again, she has some bad dialogue, but she does nothing with it. There are some scenes where she and Detective Kekoa Shaw (George Young) are supposed to flirt a bit, and those moments are cringe-worthy. To say they have no chemistry is putting it very mildly. And these are just the most noteworthy examples. This film would have been powerful in all the right ways if a script doctor had softened some of the ridiculous dialogue and if Wan had either cast much of it differently OR had given some worthwhile acting notes.Having said that, MALIGNANT is still a watchable film for those looking for something a little different from their horror films and who don't mind some gore. The primary ""villain"" is remarkably creepy (always a help) and the film never tries to make its plot credible, and instead just goes full-on outrageous without apology. That was the right choice. I enjoyed it, even with the glaring missed opportunities.",Malignant
172,chris_rowe-881-168820,Tale of two films,8,14 September 2021,"Ok so the first half of this film it felt like I was in the late 90s just plodding through a generic horror and it was slow and hid behind shocking topics whilst adding very little.The next half I felt was really good, enjoyable twists, really well acted especially the lead and her sister, the rest were typical horror extras not up to much.Pros
Fresh twist that feels different
I enjoyed the CGI but can see some not
Acting
Potential for sequel
Wasn't a love story
Some clever ideas and continuity.Underground scenesCons
Over reliance on darkness, even bits that didn't need it for example, police interview, evidence room and driving to the abandoned mental hospital in the day yet waiting till it's dark... it's abandoned, really wish horrors would evolve from old style houses, darkness in unrealistic situations and torches.Plot holes, there were a few, the cop literally sees it's not her yet that doesn't seem to matter, is it really believable the sister wouldn't here the hostage in all the time she's there? The obvious scientific stuff that's a bit amiss but you can overlook some of that.The humour missed its mark.Needed better support characters (deeper)
Using sensitive subjects such as domestic abuse and miscarriages.The female police officer eating a lolly over a corpse to look cool
The same type of house as soo many horrors, mix it up.There's a lot going of stuff blatantly a bit poor with the movie, some things you just have to ignore to enjoy something that's not based entirely in realism and some bits that were cool, it tried to be different and was overall genuinely entertaining and different enough to be fresh, way better than most new horrors like candy man or spiral.I think horror films really need to evolve and stop relying on so much of the stereotypical things. It needs to freshen up, not rely on volume and darkness for scares, try and be a bit more creative.",Malignant

176,Benslie,May work for some but not for most,6,16 September 2021,"Based on the trailer alone I thought I had the story of this movie planned out and knew exactly what it was going to be about but the trailer only shows part of the movie. This can be seen as a good thing since the audience is in for a shock when the plot actually starts and you realize that the story in the trailer was more interesting than the final product. I'm not going to hate on the story as I still found some enjoyment out of it with some of the twists being revealed but at the end of the day, the audience can easily figure everything out before the halfway point. I feel like if they just focused on the crime element of this story and turned it into a crime movie with horror elements then the story could've been interesting. James Wan has proven himself recently to be an outstanding modern horror movie director and director period but this movie really brings me back to his, ""Dead Silence"" days. You can see that he really did his best with this movie and there are certain scenes that feel like a James Wan movie but for the rest of the movie I just wanted this movie to hurry up. I will add that I did enjoy the cinematography in this movie and definitely utilized dark lighting in order to cover up the special effects. The special effects in this movie weren't really that spectacular but there is one special effect that just made me curl up in horror. Usually, the acting can help save a movie but not in this movie. The only real stand out to me was Annabelle Wallis who you could tell was giving it her all the time. Everyone else had their moments but for the most part, was just bland.

Look I see what James Wan was going for and that's a homage to classic 80s slasher films. It's a shame that the film just turned into a cheesy hilariously silly pile of crap, the first half of the film was building to quite an interesting horror thriller with a strange premise but then once the big twist was revealed it just turned on its head for the worse. Some of the shots and camera work is phenomenal and really it is a well made movie as it has great special effects and great cinematography, it's just the god awful ending that ruins the whole film.

Even tho I consider myself as a horror fan and think I've seen much, this was something so new to my eyes! I don't want to write a review with spoilers so I'll stop with it here.When it comes to technical stuff, it's clearly seen that Wan's vision is so improved here. Like, we already knew he is one of the best in this genre, but his skills and talent are so next level now. He is the definition of extraordinary and unique. I'm so satisfied with the whole crew here but if I had to give one and last name, it'd be Joseph Bishara for sure. This guy is just the best at what he does!! He is so talented, he is awesome. His taste is what horror movies actually always need haha.I loved how some particular scenes were shot, like the camera angles etc., also loved the color grading.

What makes the story unpredictable is how it explains about the killer the woman was visualizing of. Whether if it's her childhood and a twist, which I won't spoil. The cinematography is well shot, especially when we get to the houses. The editing is very bloody. And the characters are very interesting to know about, even the ones around Madison. Not to mention with someone some of the actors giving their performance frightened and make the movie fun to watch. Of course, I mostly recommend for those that want to see a different direction when it comes to horror films.

187,seige-hound,Don't Expect a Conjuring or Insidious,7,12 September 2021,"I see there's a lot of negative reviews here, which isn't entirely fair in my opinion. Maybe it's a failure of the advertising, but I'll tell you right out that this film is closer in tone to a Raimi film than other James Wan fare.This film is goofy, and more of a creature feature than a supernatural horror film. Essentially the movie is about a woman who has a superpowered parasitic twin brother growing out of the back of her skull, who suddenly wakes up and goes on a revenge killing spree after being dormant for 20 years. So the majority of the film, especially in the second half, is a woman running backwards and doing fun backflips and stuff instead of being spooky.The first half sort of deceives the audience into expecting a more conventional Conjuring-like film, but by the 50 minute mark, it goes balls off the wall, with a really fun action scene in the climax (and yes I mean action action) It's obvious that James Wan took his experience directing Aquaman to heart in this film.If you're expecting a more serious horror film like the Conjuring series (which even then, you have to admit has a fair few goofy scenes) you may be disappointed, but keep an open mind. This movie is meant to be fun and silly, just because you weren't expecting that doesn't mean the movie is bad.",Malignant

193,PerryAtTheMovies,Cheesy & boring with some entertainment...,5,11 September 2021,"Rating: 54.5/100Overall, I would suggest saving your money and waiting for a home release. Too boring, bad scares, and cheesy enough to feel like a joke of a film. Flip side was decent enough acting that provide a good emotional aspect to care about some characters, cinematography was well-done, and the action provided some good fun.The review....I was not overly impressed with this film. The first forty-five minutes or so of the film was boring and took too long to get to the point of being interesting. While the signature score of the film did a great job of building up suspense and signifying key moments. It was all for nought as the actual execution of scares or those key moments, for me, sucked. One example is one character turns off the lights and then hears noises and proceeds to move into the dark to find out what's there instead of, you know, turning the lights back on. Truthfully, parts of this film felt like one big joke.Although I saw this film in a more negative light it did have some positives such as the cinematography. I enjoyed the above angle shots as the characters ran through the house. The second half of the film was more emotionally driven and caused me to care more through its remainder. The acting wasn't fantastic, but it was good enough to add to that emotional drive. There was also some decent action scenes that I found enjoyable even if the outcome of those scenes were beyond realistic.That's it for me on this one. Enjoy the show....",Malignant
194,pronitmallick,Interesting but janky,5,14 September 2021,"Malignant is a movie that starts it's presentation in a janky way and goes on keeping up that kind of jankiness. The character introduction seems odd and out of pace. The actors delivered a performance as good as they could but it didn't quite line up with everything. Director James Wan took an interesting and different approach from his usual horror flicks but instead of up, the presentation keeps going down starting from start to end. The story doesn't spark anything special in our mind, instead it fills our mind with questions that are all over the place. Right in the middle of the movie it becomes a little predictable in terms of story. In the very end of the third act especially in the climax the story as well as the presentation takes an interesting and engaging turn but that doesn't make us feel anything in the end considering the jankiness of the film from the start. Overall it's an okay type approach from director James Wan that you can add in your watchlist for the weekend but no recommendation for watching it.",Malignant

196,jcooloti,Bananas.,7,12 September 2021,"This movie is is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. It's pretty fun... and I really enjoyed seeing a campy horror film without a micro-budget. That's why people are calling it 80s... Imagine if A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 had a baby with the Matrix... you'd get something like this. There are even more 80s horror films that are huge influences on this movie but I'm not going to mention them to keep this spoiler free.Lemme say, although the feel of the movies is something like A Nightmare on Elm Street meets the Matrix, the look of the film is very 21st century. The art direction and sets are fantastic. I think I even noticed some LED screen shots (like the Mandalorian) in it. The lighting was great in an over the top/unreal kinda way. So over all, it's a pretty great looking film, and the cartoonish CGI in parts are forgivable because it's not the kind of movie shooting for absolute realism.... Though it might have been nice to see a little more practical effects.Overall, it's pretty solid entertainment for horror movie fans.

If he gets this straight and serious.... man, that's even funnier.

201,Ansango,Good but unsatisfying!,6,4 October 2021,"A terrific return to horror for James wan...The first three-fourths of the film is like a cat and mouse chase between the killer and the protagonist with a supernatural twist, but it's the last quarter that reframes the whole film in a new light. The twist is bats and you never see it coming. It's just that the twist while explaining many kinds of stuff about the ongoing mystery also leaves massive plotholes in its way. The visuals in the climax police-station altercation are janky.The ending where our protagonist defeats his foe, after learning the power of love and self-worth, leaves a lot to be desired, which makes the whole thing inadequately unsatisfying.For fans of Wan's filmography, it's an accomplished piece of film-making and even if you aren't a fan, the film is good enough that you aren't going to complain much.

Insidious, The Conjuring, Annabelle, The Nun ...it's just all the same content in different packaging.With Malignant he manages to stray away a bit and arrive in a more silly slasher genre that very much reminds me of Sam Raimi's movies and direction.Malignant is good and have flashes of awesome, but overall, it's pacing is pretty off. The first 30 minutes is interesting until it goes in to the typical Wan slog and then it ends with an intense and wellmade gory bang.If there will be a Malignant 2 (which there probably will be, considering how Wan so obviously designed a ""typical"" slasher killer with specific clothing and weapon) it might actually be the first Wan sequel i would look forward to.",Malignant

I will admit that for 3/4 of the movie I was like WTH is going on, but as answers unfolded the story becomes very unique. The acting is solid. The violence is so overwhelming to the point of being comical, but in a superb fashion. The cinematography was excellent with a very familiar vibe to the Silent Hill films at times. The music production is orchestrated beautifully.

210,influxtwo,"One Weird ""Family"" Movie",5,18 September 2021,"This is a movie that cribs heavily from the oldschool body horror genre made pulpy and popular by Frank Henenlotter's filmography like 'Basket Case', 'Brain Damage' and other late 70s films like 1978's 'The Manitou', and then fed to a new audience. It is fun enough to watch, but a bit too silly to love. It wants you to think it is some love-letter to the VHS era. There is an inconsistent tone that ranges from serious to very goofy Matrix-level action sequences. It's like they watched Stranger Things, The Matrix, and Basket Case, made this, and then fed it to the fans of the Conjuring. I prefer the original films this one is derivative of. But with that said, this was a guilty pleasure. The second half falls a part a bit compared to the rather sturdy first half. Overall not great. But quirky enough not to be bad. Really ends up being one of those drama dumpster fires that you just gotta smirk at. Lights Out, Basket Case, and Mama had a baby and it's Stranger Things and the Matrix meets late 70s wannabe Giallo. Pulp campy nonsense with a bit of a family story wedged in. Watch at your own risk. I love Frank Henenlotter's filmography so I had to check this out since it is greatly inspired by it. Can't say I cared for this much but I like that Wan is keeping this genre alive, even if it is basically a retread of Henenlotter lore. A copycat can still be fun. I would wait to stream this for free or Redbox it though, due to the inconsistent tone and wacky comedic second half that borders on goofy and contrived. Watch at your own risk, but don't expect to be scared. This is fun, campy, nonsense. But arguably in my opinion not as good as the films it rips off.",Malignant
211,lizxypopcornkid,Brings a whole new meaning to being two faced,6,11 September 2021,"I thought this movie was alright considering the fact that James wan is trying to rewrite the genre he is so present within.The soundtrack , camera work and settings are so stylish and really bring a new perspective for horror audiences within the younger years as this kind of work is reminiscent to 80s slasher films which is something really enjoyed.Another thing I liked is that James wan didn't use jumpscares, a trope within horror films that has been done to death and quite frankly bores me.I feel like this film wasn't really meant to be a film though , I feel it was more a Kickstarter for a new style of horror films seeing as now a days they are too similar in plot, scares and soundtrack sometimes.I thought the plot itself was quite creative but not very believable but then again it's a horror film it's not supposed to be so therefore I would say it was dis functional at points.However I feel the actors in this movie were greatly invested in the process and put a lot of emotion behind their performances.The only problem I truly had with his film is the plot and the fact they showed the villain a little too early on making the overly featured face a lot less scary.The script could've been a little more creative but again I feel like most of this film was too focused on creating a new style of horror so that's probably why.But overall this film is a 6/10 for its disfigured but wickedly Inventive plot and the stunning cinematography and soundtrack

The dark shape was always a female shape.It has some gotcha moments that make you jump but not out of horror but the sudden appearance of sound or visuals.

The camera work and visuals were great, the tone of the movie was campy and ridiculous and the action sequences were a lot of fun. Plus the story itself, although over the top and impossible, was still entertaining as a throwback to really old slasher flicks. The movie lost points for the music/score as it was very intrusive and boisterous which was a complete turn off. The acting was pretty bad and aside from Annabelle Wallace and McKenna Grace, there was no one recognizable. There were some cheesy reveals and lackluster ""High"" points which overall kind of diminishes James Wan's work even though his presence was felt the entire time.

There is literally no horror in the last 30 minutes of the film, it almost seems amateurish, and you leave feeling disappointed after investing that amount of time.

218,FilmChamp20,I had to check twice to make sure this wasn't a comedy,1,13 September 2021,"The beginning of the movie was so badly acted with cringe I thought it was purposeful. I legitimately thought it wasn't meant to be taken seriously and was making light or a mockery out of actual horror movies. Then as the movie progressed, with the dialogue and unnatural sense of conversation, I had to check again to make sure it wasn't a comedy. It was just too many cliches and awfully cringy exchanges of dialogue. The movie would have worked if it committed to be a comedy instead. However, sadly, it was determined to be an action thriller horror movie. My family and I actually got some laughs in from how dreadful the line delivery of actors and actresses where. The writing was terrible.I was finished in the jail scene. I won't ruin it for you, but if you have hbo max at home, fast forward to a point just as you see the main actress in a jail cell full of women. Play it. You'll thank me. It's hilariously bad and over the top. Like a rated R ""you're not you when you're hungry"" snickers commercial. It was so stupid that it was brilliant. Absolutely not what it was going for, but I needed that ridiculousness to laugh at. Definitely a movie moment you'll show your friends too.In conclusion, don't watch this thinking it'll be a scary movie with ghosts or demons. None of that is here. The concept is creative, but it doesn't work here at all, perhaps due to the horrible writing or acting. Watch this if you're bored and want to have fun making fun of a scary movie. You could watch this all by yourself, you'll go to sleep with a smile from laughter instead of fear. Perfect cure for if you already can't slept from a previous scary movie you watched.",Malignant

239,guskeller,More pleasure than guilt,7,11 September 2021,"Sometimes cheese works. James Wan's Malignant is a great example of knowing how to go over the top with the right amount of self-awareness. The story may be ridiculous but that is an intentional choice that is executed with skill yet never taken too seriously. Chiefly, all the technical aspects are well done, creating an engaging and energizing atmosphere. The stylish lighting, active camera movement, and rich sound design all carry ample weight here. This transforms what could've been a silly project into a genuinely entertaining experience.Meanwhile, the cast is fairly forgettable but that is okay. Annabelle Wallis anchors the film with a fine performance which is all Malignant really needs. This gives supporting actors like Michole Briana White room to have fun hamming it up. The synthwave score isn't totally relevant, but it sets a fitting mood and ties in somewhat with the electrical motif. The editing and production design are occasionally excessive as they push the creepy tone, but that is understandable and forgivable. All told, Malignant is a quintessential guilty pleasure that is distinctly more pleasure than guilt.Writing: 6/10

242,TheLegendOfThe42,Interesting premise ruined by atrocious writing,3,11 September 2021,"This film is another example of a few quite compelling ideas ruined by terrible writing. One can only wonder how James Wan would indeed agree to shoot such a garbage script.The intention seems to be to go into some sort of campy Giallo fun, but the tonality of the whole film undermines this. So if this was indeed the intention, the execution was quite poor, since it didn't manage to capture the spirit of the Italian masters at all.The visual presentation is really good, even masterful at times, but all the good ideas that went into this film are wasted, thanks to a bizarrely naive and inconsistent screenplay. The characters are dull and flat, their interactions and decisions are absurdly naive and stupid at times, and the pacing is limping quite a bit. The supernatural element is inconsistent and constantly changes to suit the childish plot.Given this weak material, the actors try their best, but ultimately come across as being unsure what to make of this. And so there is this strange discrepancy between content and interpretation that also conveys Wan's insecurity of how to handle the material.The music is trying to be a modern version of the famous Giallo scores, but ultimately fails at hitting the right spots. Most of the movie is overscored with sometimes blatantly inappropriate levels of intensity or meaning.All in all, this feels like taking the worst aspects of Giallo and overdoing them for ""modern"" audiences, ultimately rendering this film into an involuntary comedy. Which is a bummer, since some of the ideas are pretty neat and, in the hands of a competent writer, could have been turned into a much better film.",Malignant

245,Victor_Fallon,I'm not buying the 'intentionally bad' excuse.,3,13 September 2021,"'Malignant' comes off like a botched parody. It doesn't earn the badge of a quality B-movie because the audience is never sure if it's being goofy or taking itself seriously. Dialogue is poor, often weakly whispered and inaudible, or baked in vocal fry to the point of being unintelligible. Actors don't seem to know what the director wants. Some characters behave like they're in a 50s sci-fi, others like a 90s action movie, a children's TV show, a psychological drama... it's all over the place. Nobody has any idea what the atmosphere should be and as a result, there is none.The music jars between stock drones and stings, generic orchestral and blaring synths, dragging the whole production down. Tension and horror are absent. False scares and cliches are present.The story spans gothic horror, supernatural horror, medical horror, body horror and whatever else, zipping through sub-genres in a cavalier fashion until the only rational response is... ""Why?"" The main story is one you've heard before, but I won't spoil. As others have mentioned, a very famous book explores the same premise, but way better.The lighting is excellent and the bold use of colour is enjoyable, being very 'graphic novel' in style, but the camerawork is busy and obnoxious. I wish James Wan would calm down and fill his frames with meaningingful images instead of the high-energy zooms, dollies and cranes that seems to be his crutch. The CGI is trash, obviously. There is zero reason not to be 100% practical in a movie like this.It's not easy being a horror fan in the 21st century when this is what is slapped onto our screens. If this was a straight-up comedy it might have worked. But it isn't and it doesn't.",Malignant

247,shawthingproductions,Atrocious,2,12 September 2021,"James Wan has had some great films under his belt so this was clearly ""a bit of fun"" for him, and something different. The problem is ""a bit of fun"" for him doesn't translate well for the rest of us. Also, to give you further warning about this film, there's clearly a paid campaign going on to give it positive reviews. If you look at the ten star reviews - they all have the same grammar, all say the same thing and most of them even call the director by the same wrong name (James Van). I hope whomever paid for such a campaign gets their money back but hey ho...People say this film is a throwback to the 80s / 90s. Apparently THAT is why the acting is bad. Right, okay. Or, I don't know, it could just be bad acting? The rubbish CGI is because it is a throwback to the 80s and 90s too, right? Because, whilst not over used, it is horrible and pulls you right out of the sequence you're watching.The storyline IS something out of that time period though and that's not necessarily a good thing. It could have been if handled properly but the script is clunky and the film overstays its welcome by a good thirty minutes. Had they trimmed the script and tightened it, it could have been an ""okay"" film but I almost gave up an hour into the film. At the hour and a half point there is an obvious twist which IS fun for about 5 minutes. Had this been at the end of the film (like the franchise ""Saw"" does) then unexpecting audience members would walk out with shock and have something to talk about. But no, the film carries on to try and wrap things up... Except it doesn't wrap things up and I can't say ""why"" because it will ruin it for people.It's a shame this film turned out to be so lacklustre because I had high hopes for it but, honestly, this is such a misfire I don't understand how it even came to be.What I will say is, the music is good and there's some great shots in there but - ultimately - this film is the director's joke which not many will laugh at.",Malignant

The plot of 'Malignant' is feeble and nutty, so ludicrous as to be amusing, and indeed I found myself breathless with laughter at times watching this tripe. The pace is completely off and its tone is all over the place. The dialogue is drivel, ""driveling being characteristic of children, idiots, and dotards."" I was confused as to who the target audience was but not confused enough to ever want to be member of it.The cast ticks the racial quotient boxes that have become so important these days. But the troupe cannot act. Not for toffee. The wig on the principal Maddie Hasson is inexcusable. Annabelle Wallis is a better actress than poor Maddie but is a charisma vacuum. Not that any of the other actors and actresses come off any better. Far from it.The film references 'The Ring', 'The Shining', 'Hereditary', 'The Babadook' but does not rival any decent horror flick. Not by a long chalk. Talking of 'Hereditary'. There is a doll's house sequence that is really effective near the beginning of the film and we see a doll's house later in the movie, but alas these references come to nothing.Look out for the scene of the estranged Mother falling through the ceiling. It is comedy gold. As is the scene in the drunk tank, or in today's parlance public inebriation center.The high rating howsoever obtained may justify financial backing for the next film in the franchise.

The trailer was so deceiving which made this movie look fresh and different. However, the entire movie felt like it was trying to give the best of the 80s and still have fun past that point but it is definitely not going to win awards or receive a lot of attention. This was the messiest and ugliest movie I have seen in a long time.Unanswered questions:
Why can the teratoma make phone calls without a phone, or talk through the radio? Why do the lights explode whenever the thing is thinking or wanting to come out? Why did the ex husband not hear his wife come down the stairs before he died, why did he see basically what looked like an apparition?This movie drew on a lot of what was utilized in the Conjuring films, from the camera work to the ""haunting scares,"" and even the music (which to be honest has gotten really f&@king boring). I sincerely believe James Wan did not have a clear vision for what he wanted out of the demon/monster/killer/teratoma. This reminds me of his struggle to create a concept for the demon in the Conjuring 2. I think there was talk about how the nun became the nun through a lot of trial and error because he didn't really know what he wanted from this demon (which would explain the awful CGI growl death of the demon at the end of TC2). But where that movie prevailed by great performances and a great storyline, this one failed massively because of its unengaging script and poor story. I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of it because it was just painful to listen to the cops, or the sister Sydney, or the tapes. It was all just very gimmicky, like Dead Silence.",Malignant

Director James Wan and the writing team have brought something new to the table. This is what happens when you take the premise of an 80's B-movie and give it a major budget. The last act is something you've only dreamt of, and you're sure to enjoy every second of it.The technical aspect is the most intriguing part of this film. The cinematography is always pulling you in deeper and the camera movement is constant. The vibrant color palette over a gorgeous production design leaves the viewer entranced. The score and sound design are phenomenal as well. Some of the best aspects are the visual effects, shots melded together and appear seamless as they do so.As well done as the effects are, some of them miss the mark. If you dig to deep into them you can find flaws, but the good outweigh the bad in this instance. Some of the acting can come off as being phoned in with Annabelle Wallis being the standout performance. This film takes you to a place some may find to bizarre and that could be a deterrent, but by that time you will be so invested it shouldn't matter.Malignant is a modern-day giallo film.

274,JoelAlexanderr,"A campy, gory blast with an insane final act",8,14 September 2021,"Many opinions have been thrown around about James Wan's new horror film MALIGNANT, but one thing for certain is that movies like this one aren't often released by a major studio. When the movie starts, it seems like a decent yet predictable slasher flick that is aiming to be a campy romp. However, even though MALIGNANT is definitely campy, by the end it becomes one of the wildest horror films of the year. Wan was clearly sick of creating watered-down PG-13 studio tentpoles like Aquaman and Furious 7, so he decides to make the most of his R-rating in this film and it's all the better for it. Yes, much of the movie could be far better when it comes to acting and narrative, but the movie never stops being a bloody good time and it never takes itself seriously enough for the flaws to distract from the horror.The plot starts out somewhat typically: Madison (Annabelle Wallis) starts to realize that something may be lurking in her large creepy-looking home in Seattle. However, once her abusive boyfriend is out of the picture, she starts getting terrifying visions of gory murders that are happening in real-life elsewhere across the city. Anything more revealed here could spoil the movie's surprises, mainly because certain plot details in the first 20 or so minutes make the film appear to be predictable. The manner in which Wan introduces the narrative elements makes it seem like it will be easy to predict, but the movie has far more in store than the first act lets on. My personal prediction of how the narrative would play out didn't end up being entirely wrong, but Wan goes way further with this concept than I anticipated, making for the craziest third act of 2021 so far.While performances like Wallis in the lead role are solid, Wan's direction is the star of the show here. If another director was helming this same screenplay, the end product would not have worked out near as well. He transforms generic scenes of demonic horror into tense and unpredictable sequences that never fail to unsettle the audience. The transitions from the realities of Madison's life to the scenarios of the horrifying murders are great combinations of visual effects and Wan's direction to create some creepy imagery. The pacing is very solid and makes it so that viewers are never bored even if people aren't getting violently killed on-screen.Most of my opinions on MALIGNANT involve the absurd ending, which elevates the film a cut above just another demonic possession horror movie. I had an absolute blast with the last 30 minutes, which involves some of the most bloody and conceptually bonkers filmmaking made by a major studio in recent memory. A lot of people may have gone into MALIGNANT thinking that it is a serious and psychological film akin to Insidious, which may be why many were disappointed. Wan wanted to make a campy throwback movie that horror fans could have a blast during, and on that level I think he succeeds with flying colors.B+",Malignant

280,premmgor,Malignant Honest Review!,7,14 September 2021,"Malignant is one of the interesting and weird horror films I have ever seen. The Highlights are: it's unlike any other regular horror flick and has its originality, amazing Camerawork, and great performances. Though it has its plot holes, moments where you laugh but if you are premyy of the horror genre you won't regret watching. Turn your brain off and enjoy. Highly Recommended! 😄",Malignant

282,kegebler,Really took a bad turn.,5,14 September 2021,So we have a younger looking Winona Ryder. That is fairly good but over acts in some parts or I should say the director just carries it too far. It really stretches the imagination towards the end and not to mention not a single person carries a cell phone or gun or any type. Not to mention why does everybody go upstairs. It does have some good points entertaining but hard to watch in some points.,Malignant

I'm amazed at the good reviews this movie has received from viewers. In my opinion, this movie makes all of the Teen slasher movies look like master pieces in film making. The acting is laughable, and the ""ultimate reveal"" is an even bigger joke. It would have been physically impossible for the ""villain"" in the plot. To do the things that are done. The speed, agility, and strength alone would be impossible. Only a super hero could do most of the stuff the villain does. Two stars because I was able to watch the whole movie.",Malignant

295,plasssaskia,If you have nothing else to watch why not,5,13 September 2021,So my friend recommended this movie and give it a 7 star so I said why not. The first half of the movie was boring and I was really confused. I was questioning if Gabriel was a ghost since she can only see him and how he was able to climb on walls. As the movie progressed it started to make sense a little. I was left with some questions for example1. When she had the little scuffle with the cop when Gabriel took over her body why when she woke up she was not in pain but was able to bleed on her bed from the brain opening2. Why was he able to take down a whole police station but couldnt kill the one cop by himself when he was followed?3. If he was dormant all these years how was he so skillful in fighting?4. why did he not kill the sister right away just like what he did with the baby when he was woken up?Overall this movie made lil sense like i stated earlier.,Malignant
296,jaydogva,Was Looking Good Until...,4,13 September 2021,This movie was a good watch and was intriguing until Gabrielle went all John Wick in the police department. Why oh why do today's filmmakers do stuff like this? Please let's keep things within a certain realm of believability. When did this personality have time to train to fight? Great concept and overall creep factor at the onset but concluded horribly. My rating was at a 7 and dropped to a 4 quickly after that scene.,Malignant

299,adotson-98233,James Wan returns to horror in a strange acid trip,6,11 September 2021,"""Malignant"" is a very very very weird movie, that I'm not fully sure how to feel about. It's concept is very cool, but the movies way of storytelling makes it feel like a horror that wants to be a comedy.Let me start off with the good. Overall the cinematography, and look of the movie is great. It's a very good looking movie. It's dark and gothic at times which I thought was really cool. The movie also has fantastic gore. It's a very bloody movie that features a lot of creative sequences that I really liked. The score too is actually pretty good. It's a very over the top, but earned score that I liked, cause it works for this type of movie. The acting too for the most part was actually not too bad. And finally the movies twist was very cool. It's a very unexpected twist that really surprised me and I have to applaud them for that.However I did find this movie a bit underwhelming. The issues I have is that this movie is kinda hilarious. And not in the good way. There's a lot of unintentional comedy here, and it's very bad. The movie also has some CGI shots that looked very weird, and it really took me out of the movie. The characters too are a little weak. There's not much given to them aside from our lead. The characters are very weak. And finally the movie has a lot of strange editing choices that at times worked but other times didn't.Overall ""Malignant"" is a very strange movie that is very mixed with me. While it does have great gore, good cinematography, and a great concept, the characters are weak, and the movie has a lot of unintentional comedy. But it's not a bad movie.",Malignant
300,Spencer-Staggs,"No, This Isn't A Homage To Old Horror Films",5,16 September 2021,"To me, Malignant felt stupid. Yep, I'm just gonna come straight out and say it. I thought this film felt mostly cheesy and stupid. Now there were some parts of the film that were very good, but for the most part, Malignant is not a very well made film.Malignant centers around a woman who keeps having visions of a hooded man killing people, and she soon realizes that these aren't just visions, but that they are actually happening in the real world. Many plot holes ensue.When the first person is killed by this hooded killer, it is Madison's husband, but how Madison and the police handle this situation is just so, so dumb. It is just honestly impossible to state how awful the plot can be without sounding stupid. Anyway, the police come and they find Madison's husband dead (partially mutilated as well) and they find Madison upstairs unconscious, but HOLD UP A MINUTE! They find Madison unconscious in the nursery even though she was left in the bathroom, and how exactly can Gabriel be chasing Madison if he is part of her? What . . . ? The cops also don't seem to take notice of the door that was smashed into the into the bathroom, and besides that even if Gabriel is Madison's parasitic twin how in the world can he control her body in that way? WHAT THE F--?!?! He's like a superhuman! Remember, he's supposed to be a deformed sort of human, not a superhuman who, - ugh, forget it. Anyway, the cops investigate and seem to want to blame Madison for the murder - - you know what? I just want to get onto the positive aspects of this film.I quite enjoyed the scenes where Madison's mom & sister are watching the old videos, and I also enjoyed the scene with Madison, her mom, and her sister watching old videos as well.Another good scene within the film is the chase scene between Detective Kekoa Shaw and Gabriel. Yeah, that was indeed a great chase sequence.The opening scene however, is not very good. In fact I kind of hated that. The acting from Jacqueline McKenzie in the opening is not good. And how exactly is the security guard supposed to help drag Gabriel back to the chair after what Gabriel did to him. I WANT MY MOVIES TO MAKE AT LEAST A BIT OF SENSE!! *Gasping for breath* I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but there were elements of this film I couldn't take .Anyway, Malignant isn't a horrible movie, but it isn't one that I would consider to be good either. I am finished with my rant, although I do think there is more that I should have covered within this film. Thanks for reading my horrid rant.",Malignant
301,ohroonoko,9 for originality and suspense,9,26 September 2021,"Director James Wan said he wanted to deliver an original film, and he really came through here.

But without that supernatural element, the story makes a lot of sense and is very intriguing.",Malignant

303,afrocut,A backwards horror romp,5,12 September 2021,"I've seen the movie, I've seen the two divided camps on reviews, and I am here to say this is a hard movie to grade. One camp of reviewers, the ones who are quick to say ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen"", love to throw a one star rating on Imdb and blast everything as awful. A one star rating is the equivalent of saying there's nothing redeemable about it. This couldn't be further from the truth in the case of ""Malignant"". Director James Wan has a talent for getting a creative shot. Here the camera swings and moves along hallways and at some points becomes an aerial view of the inner workings of creepy locations. He also has a great understanding of action. Mainly over the top action that is just insanely fun to watch. There's a set piece here that is so crazy, so campy and so over board that i out loud cheered it's silliness to go ever higher. This brings me to the second camp, the over defenders. This side gives perfect 10 score to every thing that they remotely enjoy. I've seen some heavy and bizarre reasons for these high ratings, that the movie is paying tribute to the horror styles of everything from the 80's , 90's and even Italian horror. The last is the most reasonable with its over the top crazy last half, but that's it. No, here Wan is just going back to his horror movie ways, with cliche characters (mostly cops), bad dialogue, strange music choices and a corny over the top use of CGI and horror elements. The first 20 minutes are bad, pure and simple, they perfectly set the tone of what's to come. But what's even more odd is how quick the movie tells you what the twist will be and how much they shove it in your face throughout. I find it hard to believe that this pretends to be a shock, after all the opening credits go willingly into gruesome spoiler territory. Something else that's funny is how the movie is set in the present but feels unnatural in its time period. Old Houses in fog and abandoned spocky castle like sanatoriums sit along the hill side from something out of a 50's movie. And then there's the reveal where this movie picks up in a silly way that changed the game for me, feeling like cheap body horror of the late 70's than psychological horror of today. I wish the movie embraced this aspect from the beginning, Because when it gets semi serious again it will lose you. This will be more memorable in the future than say the new ""Candyman"" reboot and that's why It's hard to score. At least that movie had something to say and this one had only something to show. This is why I'll stay firmly out of both camps and give this a 5/10.",Malignant
304,cimorellisteve,Original and entertaining,7,12 September 2021,"Horror isn't even my favorite genre buy you have to give Wan credit for originality.

305,ethantoy,James Wan's Unnatural Horror Film,7,10 September 2021,"Malignant is by far one of the most vividly beautiful horror films I've seen in a while; it's cinematography is phenomenal and it's colors are vibrant. It's a gloomy, neon-esque horror film that is more or something akin to an 80's slasher. I found this film to be so fun and energetic, but I also found several huge issues with its content alone. What strikes me the most out of this entirely is that James Wan is no new contender to the horror genre, yet this felt lackluster and almost like a blemish in his career when comparing this to his record of horror films. I found the pacing to be incredibly fast, overwhelmed with lore and dialogue that just seemed way too convoluted for its own good. The characters seemed okay at best too, which really doesn't help the story's main arc. I felt that the entire first half of the film was reminiscent of Conjuring and Saw, but the latter half just became an insane blood fest of gore and violence (I am not complaining for that!) that almost pales in comparison to its first act. The premise and identity of the antagonist is super eerie and morbid- but I didn't actually FIND the antagonist that frightening at all, but more so awed by its design and origin. This is definitely a good horror film, but it lacks the James Wan touch that he has had with other films. This isn't a scary film honestly, and I've been scared by much less than I have here- I honestly think this film is a horror-action film, and that's really different. It was akin to movies like Underworld or Resident Evil; it's a odd conjunction to film but I think James Wan made something really unique here and it shows for sure the darkest of his films. It's as violent as Saw, and it's as brutal as a shock film. However, it takes quite sometime to build that up. And it culminates in a wicked last act. I definitely could recommend this to horror fans, but for most audiences, this is a chore of a film to sit through because of its poor pacing and characterization. It is a good film though in regards.",Malignant

Both brilliant films with a free and effortless flow between different genres.The Malignant is delightful, very well made, cross between the genres. It starts as a horror film, but very soon introduces elements of thriller, fantasy and action film. The story itself will be astoundingly surprising with uncanny special effects - which most are in the splatter genre - and on top of that; this all is directed marvelously.

I think he's pretty much the best at what he does. The best thing I can say is that unlike so many other supposable horror/thrillers you aren't sat waiting for a scare or a disappointing last 30 minutes, Wan paces his films well so you're always interested in what's going on and not drifting off. The CGI is a bit Meh but apart from that you get a solid story, a whodunnit almost and a generous offering of violence. I wasn't a huge fan of conjuring 3 tbh so was pleased to watch this.

I felt like I was watching a Giallo or 80s low budget B-movie if it were competently made and given a massive budget.This is a horror movie the way they used to be. Unpredictable, insane, gross-out, freak out stuff. It's not a movie made by a committee, it's not the usual haunted doll or spooky house movie where the narrative grinds to a halt as you wait for the inevitable loud noise jump scare when someone looks into a mirror or closes a door.And it's not the joyless, ugly torture porn that has plagued the genre in recent decades either. Nor is it a wink-wink self-referential Scream type parody either.Malignant plays it relatively straight for much of its runtime, presenting a genuinely intriguing mystery and a scary, seemingly supernatural killer.But when the third act happens (you'll know when it does), the film goes completely off the rails. In one of the most over the top sequences ever, Malignant embraces its silly concept and goes all out action gore-fest. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and ended up laughing my butt off. The last time a movie completely flipped the script like this was From Dusk Till Dawn. Here the twist actually makes sense in terms of the narrative. The story - while stupid - is surprisingly coherent.That's the secret sauce to many horror classics. Take a dumb, disgusting or bonkers concept, and fully commit to it. It may not please focus groups, but it's how you make a cult movie that remains memorable.What a breath of fresh air. Thank you, James Wan. This was beautiful.",Malignant

The plot might have lope hole, but it is very close to perfect, every clue given was just making perfect sense, the unpredictable twist really make up the flaw.From the camera work you can tell this is James Wan's work. Remind me one of his work Insidious. Also let me think of Glass from M Night Shyamalan. The eerie sound effect and creepy atmosphere is impeccable.

They also love to put very clever twists throughout the film that allows for multiple viewings.There is so much to dissect in this film as it's got a ton of media easter eggs and homages from the 70s 80s and 90s that you should be able to pick up quite quickly. I would say that this is a horror film, as it indeed is but it could be many other different genres as well.The one thing being is that this definitely feels like an 80s slasher movie. Everything about it even when it comes to the cheesy acting is meant to be camp. You'll have a few laughs but you'll also cover your eyes.What a twist! Don't worry no spoilers. But I never would have guessed what was exactly happening in a million years. Sometimes I think it's what it's going to be since it's been done before and then it does a complete 180 (and a few 360s wink wink).But that twist? My gosh. While it feels funny and absurd at times, the scares are here and it's a pretty brutal film - But not entirely THAT bad...(?), if you watch a lot of horror.This is definitely something I will be owning as I seem to always do when it's James Wan.But that twist.

The movie tries to keep you in the dark on purpose about the mystery to the movie - much like I am about Spoilers. The trouble is this is the movie so it's a bit more of an annoyance like someone toying with you. ""I know something, you don't know.""
In the end results it really falls apart, nothing seems to match well and some of worst CGI fight scenes I have seen from Hollywood in a long time. I felt like there was more if they could've given more of a damn about the story and filling plot holes than they did filling it with their personal agenda.

No. Was it terrible? No. Basically it was just good/ok. The gore was good and the killer scenes were cool. Basically this score gets a 7 for it being a James Wan original film and it's not terrible.

It is something that borders between the fantastic and the eccentric, but without a doubt a twist that is not expected and that will not leave you indifferent at all.Technically, Maligno does not look like any movie, although he does not have the production of The Conjuring, James Wan achieves terrifying sequences. However, it is in the last act where he takes advantage and makes use of practical effects on CGI and even has the luxury of increasing the action. Likewise, the photography plays with the strong shades of colors, typical of the Italian giallo, and the music that a cover of ""Where's my mind?"" Uses ingeniously. By Safari Riot.Maligno may not be the film that comes to revolutionize the genre, that is an earthquake for the industry and generates billions of dollars.

Since then, he's dipped his toes mostly into the more supernatural waters with films like Dead Silence, The Conjuring, and Insidious. With Malignant he creates something almost completely unclassifiable. At times, it's sci-fi, other times candy-colored giallo homage, regular slasher, and haunted house film.These elements don't always come together in the most seamless of ways, but when they do, it's electrifying and gleefully bizarre in the best ways.

It's a ride.Mysterious murders, a woman with an obscured childhood, creepy psych wards-these are some of the trappings of James Wan's latest nightmare. And, let's be honest, some of us come for the name. James Wan is now a legendary director, particularly In the horror genre, and I'm one of those who is willing to buy a ticket for that name alone. And maybe that was what tripped me up.I had high expectations for this one, and I immediately felt disappointed within the first fifteen minutes. I felt like I was watching every cliche of the horror genre trotted out dutifully in a by-the-numbers horror plot which was lit and shot like a made for TV special. The acting was not horrible, but nothing to rave about. The scares, sound design-everything was just not what I wanted to see. It seemed to kitschy and straight up corny at times.At moments Malignant seems to be a parody of the genre, gleefully flaunting trope after trope. Weird noises in dark rooms? There are SO many. Stupid people walking into those dark rooms, slowly, without bothering to turn the lights on? Every. Single. Time. Stereotypical handsome police detective impetuously running into danger, alone, over and over? Check. Geeky sidekick chick? Yes, and for no apparent reason.This movie brought back memories of watching Scream for the first time, and I struggled to tell if the movie was aware of how stupid it came across at times, or if that was the point.The first act didn't impress me. The second act I was literally shaking my head at the dumb choices all the leads make. Third act made me think I was watching something different.This isn't a Conjuring repeat, it's not a Saw style (though influences of both are there). Rather, I'd liken it to the Kill Bill of the James Wan library. Long on violence and leaning in hard to character cliches. It has tearful moments for the cast that won't make you cry at all (you might even chuckle) and, in the end, the movie seemed moderately aware of its weirdness.It won't make my list of all time favorites, but it's a suitable end of summer horror fare, and, whatever it is, it isn't boring.

It is not terrible, but you are waiting for something cooler to happen....
There are some good jumpscares / Visual Elements in it. However I didn't feel it was THAT scary and the characters were kinda flat.However, as the film progresses, it introduces to its more insane / absurd stuff and it gets better !James Wan said in the interview, that he tried to MIX a lot of different genres in this film. And it shows.The film is a mix of Paranormal Horror (feeling like Wan's previous works), a murder mystery, a slasher, and more! Some of these elements were weaker than the others.. But it was cool to see James Wan mixing these stuff into one film.Wan also said in an interview that this would be his most divisive film, and it shows in its Rotten Tomaotes and Metacritic ratings. He mentioned that this is his most violent film. And the film IS. From brutal murders to Bonkers killing spree - the film is a BLOODFEST.THE TWIST - I REALLY hope that I didn't read / scroll memes on reddit. I Kinda guessed the twist from the first act ;((. So go into this one BLIND> Do Not read any spoilers!!But still, the reveal scene was so grotesque and weird - I was surprised when I saw it and still lingers on my mind.So I would say the film is very creative and original - not only the twist but how the film is made, how the film presents itself, how the film combines the eleents of horror. I just wish the first act was more interesting.👀This could be the beginning of a new horror Icon / Franchise !!💥Recommend it. This is worth watching purely of the twist and the third act. But don't expect anything oscar - worthy lol.",Malignant
377,javier_8,"It has A LOT of flaws, but I actually enjoyed it.",7,26 September 2021,"Let's begin by what's entertaining. The main villain/monster/evil idea is actually pretty cool (though the execution is really goofy and laughable at moments). But the main issue with this movie is that they put this villain in a generic horror B movie full of tropes, like they copy/pasted the script from any generic slasher and they replaced the ""monster"".The direction is fine I guess, a lot of good camera shots, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the movie.So what's wrong about the movie? Everything else.-Generic B horror movie plot, from beginning to end, it's all 100% predictable by the book.-Generic hollow characters that are only remembered by who they are (the protagonist, the sister, the mother, the detective, etc...) they have no depth at all. There's also ONE character that's only there stablish that ""the male detective is hot"", that's her only reason for being in the movie (yes, THAT's the level of character development in this movie).-Generic detectives always one step behind and not calling for backup.-Generic trope of abandoned hospital person that goes alone to investigate the past and finds detailed files and footage about everything.-The mother character is completely useless, she's only there for exposition.-In this case when it's CGI most of the time it looks ""decent"", but when it's practical effects, it's goofy, cringe and laughable.-Gore somehow well executed, but it's not scary, it's just gory.-Generic obvious resolution of the movie.-The very last line of the movie... man, get a writer ASAP.It's not THAT bad if you want to watch a generic B movie with ""something different"" of a monster, I don't regret watching it, it was fun somehow, but I can't overlook all these flaws.",Malignant

397,kstice-25195,One of 2021's best horror movies,7,11 September 2021,"James Wan consistently creates quality horror movies. While Malignant is not quite good enough to be considered a future classic, it is still a good movie worth watching. The first half of this film is scary and suspenseful, in many ways it reminded me of James Wan's Lights Out (2016). The locations are creepy such as the Seattle Underground and the monster is very unique. All of the scenes create interesting developments to the plot, making the two hour runtime fly by. Unfortunately, there are some noticeable problems with the film. As the movie progresses into the second half, it becomes more of an action film as it loses the scares and suspense. The film can also be a bit ridiculous at times, with characters making traditionally dumb mistakes that one would expect in a horror movie. Additionally, most characters in the film are either forgettable or unlikeable. As much as I like Adam from Supernatural, his character in Malignant is excruciating to watch. Despite these problems, James Wan has created another good movie and any horror movie fan should watch this film. 7/10Pros and Cons Summary+Scary and suspenseful first half+Unique and interesting monster+Fast paced-Mediocre characters-Second half loses the suspenseful tone of the first half-The movie is a bit ridiculous at times.",Malignant

403,thecanadian-23317,"Weird, creepy, and kind of silly... but very unique",8,18 September 2021,"Full disclosure: I'm a massive James Wan fan. Anything that he does, I'm there, so when I saw that he was doing another horror movie I was stoked. I purposely didn't watch any trailers or look up anything about the movie because I didn't want to know anything.I just finished the movie, and... I have some thoughts. This will be completely spoiler free. First, the good: the visuals (aside from one or two moments of wonky CG), the acting, and the cinematography. There are multiple sequences that were stupendously done with very inventive camera work. Everything in the movie looks great, and the acting was really good overall. The only thing that seemed a bit off in the visual department was Annabelle Wallis' wig - it just didn't look like her real hair.The bad: there are some moments throughout that were pretty corny. Some of the dialogue was pretty bad, and the movie tries to end positively, but due to how things play out it's really not positive... but I can't really get into that. Also, I found certain plot developments in the final act to be a little silly. There was once when I actually laughed because I thought it was just dumb.But you know what? I have to give this movie some insane props because it's incredibly unique. As horror movies have been around for decades and decades, it gets difficult to come up with anything new or fresh, but this movie felt fresh. Not all of its ideas work, and some of the ideas are ridiculous in a bad way. But Wan wasn't afraid to get weird and do something outside the box and I think that deserves praise.I do recommend seeing the movie, just go in with an open mind and be willing to get a little weird with it.",Malignant
404,muvbuff-45737,Campy Fun,7,30 September 2021,"Do not come into this film expecting another Conjuring or Insidious.

Congratulations, you ""got"" a movie with zero subtlety or depth! I mean, come on, it's obvious from the get-go that this is intended to be a campy, old school horror flick. My problem with it was that it wasn't campy ENOUGH. I feel like if you're going to go in that direction, really go for it. Unfortunately, the first two-thirds of the movie were kind of frustrating, as the movie attempted to weave in and out of genres, and seemed to take itself a little too seriously at times. I kept losing interest because, to me, the twist that they were building up to was obvious from the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie. However, the way that twist was revealed in the final act was absolutely hilarious. The jailhouse scene had me cracking up and was by far the best part of the movie, and completely worth the price of admission. (Even though I saw it on HBO Max, so bonus for not having to pay admission!) The ending was a bit blah, complete with the requisite final shot hinting that ""it ain't over,"" but I'm not sure how else it could've ended.

408,docdra,Not great - not horrible.,5,14 September 2021,"This was a throwback to the 'good' old 80's horror flicks AFTER they became more comedy than horror. You have some sporadic bad music, some cheesy exposition and dialogue, some, ""Don't go in there,"" moments, and some laugh out loud moments - at least for me.A few things to note:A) It isn't scary - not in the leastB) The first 3/4 of the film is basically crapC) The last 1/4 of the film while a bit predictable is what had me laughing, but was more entertaining than the previous partsD) This is a good 'group watch' movie, as you can all sit there and yell at the screen about how stupid everyone is in the movie without fear of missing important dialogue because most of the dialogue is predictable and not importantJust to make it clear - this takes numerous tropes from various other movies and combines them into a not so original mix, adds an 80s veneer, and then wishes like hell you won't notice just how cheesy and shallow it is. It actually plays more like a TV special than an actual feature length movie, but is typical for what passes as entertainment these days - especially with all of the 'you can't do or say this' crowd now despite there being some domestic abuse depicted that didn't ultimately add to the story.",Malignant
409,olympicator,"It's not the same old thing...except, it is",5,22 September 2021,"I genuinely feel guilty writing this review, because this movie went pretty over-the-top at times and I make a point of respecting that. ""Malignant"" took risks, it had some great choreography and photography, and it even had a few moments of hilarity. I respect James Wan. But I cannot respect this movie.""Malignant"" is about a woman named Madison who starts having visions of a humanoid creature dressed in black committing murder, and each of her visions turns out to be a real event. The first half of this movie focuses on her confusion as she tries to understand where these visions come from. On paper this sounds a lot like ""Minority Report,"" but in this movie it comes off as less scientific and more gothic and more specifically connected to the protagonist. Then we get the inevitable twist, and Madison realizes why she has these visions.Apparently several people (including Wan himself) have defended this movie by saying that it is intended to be unique rather than perfect. And again, I respect this initiative. I have given positive reviews to ""Fatman"" and ""Serenity,"" movies that were certainly flawed but they were dedicated. They went for broke. Chris Stuckmann, a reviewer I admire very much, says that this movie shows a return to ""camp"" in film, and that the movie is deliberately outrageous. But it is inconsistently outrageous, switching back and forth between a plausible sci-fi scenario and a guns-blazing action fest that has written itself a blank check for supernatural abilities.The creature in black - is it related to the devil? Is it immortal, impervious to bullets? Can it turn invisible? Can it teleport? The movie implies all of these things, but it could not make up its mind. The creature consistently had the ability to manipulate electronic devices, but the movie gave no explanation as to how this was possible (and it added nothing to the plot). One aspect that made movies like ""Alien"" and ""The Terminator"" so terrifying (I mean the first of each, make what you will of the sequels) was that they were grounded, plausible, and consistent with the rules they set up. They felt like they could happen in the real world. In ""Malignant,"" we eventually get a backstory that is actually pretty realistic and gripping, but then Wan has to resort to long, repetitive action scenes and buckets of gore that serve no purpose except to remind us that every supernatural creature can conveniently acquire special powers at Villains'R'Us and secretly takes kung fu lessons in its spare time. Beware! I recently watched ""Vivarium,"" another offbeat horror movie, and while I also found that movie to be inconsistent and repetitive at times, it did not rely on shock value or gore. The scariest scenes in ""Vivarium"" were just shots of human beings, acting unnatural.And so we come to the problem: ""Malignant"" really is the same old thing, mostly. It takes a decent premise and turns it into an over-the-top action-horror flick. I think one of the reasons why this movie fails to utilize its premise is because it just didn't have much character development. Who is Madison, really? What does she do for a living? What interests her? How did she meet her husband? If Wan had taken the fairly intriguing premise, and applied it to a character whom I could actually relate to, he might have had something. Instead we just get the ""average attractive white woman has creepy stuff happen to her, and she screams a lot"" setup, the same problem I had with ""The Invisible Man."" If you just gave the characters a bit of personality, an attitude or an edge or a viewpoint, that can make the movie stick, but Wan didn't put enough thought into that.As with a lot of corny horror movies, this movie had no message except ""you have to survive."" But, again, the basic premise of this story could have meant something more. ""The Sixth Sense"" told us that you have to try to make connections with the people around you (even if they're dead). ""Vivarium"" was a cautionary tale about everything that can go wrong when you buy a house and start a family. But there was no lesson in ""Malignant."" It didn't create anything. It just portrays evil as a certainty in life, and tells us that we have to be ready for it. How? By concentrating really hard? If the villain had possessed a consistent array of abilities and weaknesses, or if the protagonist had possessed some tangible character strengths, then their conflict might have meant something to me.""Malignant"" was imaginative and pretty well-made. And yet, somehow, it actually reinforces some of the problems with the film industry: characters who ring hollow, over-reliance on shock value, and a desire to thrill the audience rather than to make something meaningful to the filmmakers themselves. I have a difficult time believing that this movie actually pleased James Wan. He delivered something different, but it wasn't personal. The greatest source of uniqueness is not the diverting of expectations; it's your own personal experiences. I don't want a filmmaker's nightmare; I want a filmmaker's dream.If you like campy movies, fine. I think ""Malignant"" needed to choose between being a plausible sci-fi thriller and a self-parody, because the individual scenes swerved between one and the other; it clearly was not trying to be both at once (you could argue that ""Starship Troopers"" tried to do that, though I did not like the end result). I am glad that some people enjoyed this movie, but I felt no connection to it.",Malignant

The movie would still have been a display of mediocracy, which, given the writers involved is no surprise, but as there obviously was a need to make a statement it is now both stupid and preachy.For every other part, Malignant was a passable small movie without any features worth remembering, possibly with the exception of the use of cheap CGI that the brilliant plot forced upon it.",Malignant

It definitely doesn't need to be bashed down to a 1/10 though. Some parts I reacted like ""Oh wow that was cool."" And others I'm just sitting with my arms crossed and was like ""C'mon, really?! Seriously?"" And I even laughed out loud at some serious parts that were meant to be taken seriously, but I couldn't take them serious. Yes! I laughed out loud! I kid you not! Be prepared to hear the line ""It wasn't me! IT WAS GABRIEL!"" most of the time. This film is listed as a Horror, but a majority of the time, it really just doesn't know what to be at all. From too much predictability, lack of character development, cheesy suspense music, cheap jump scares, some shots that look like a college student film, and a bland story, Malignant is just a try hard of Lights Out and Insidious and just unfortunately fails to be something exciting in its own way. Don't get me wrong, I thought the look and tone of it was dark/creepy, the lighting was spooky, the creature Gabriel itself is cool, the house is creepy, the kills were great, but that still doesn't change the fact that the film itself has a lot of missing pieces and could have been WAY BETTER. And for the people that are saying this has an 80s vibe or is a throwback to 80s slashers, just...please...don't even go there. You have no idea what you're talking about. The 80s slashers actually HAD an engaging story, whereas Malignant just is nowhere near engaging in the slightest.

421,nielssloos-17186,Bonkers is an understatement,6,12 September 2021,"We follow Madison who suddenly gets visions of brutal murders that are happening and she thinks they might be related to her past. Based on the synopsis and the pretty good trailer, you would expect you are in for a pretty straightforward horror movie by the beloved James Wan. And for the most part that is correct Unfortunately, unlike his previous movies, the scares didn't work that well.This movie has many issues, the tone is all over the place and the writing is extremely poor. Somehow, however, Wan's directions keeps you engaged in the silly first two acts. And if it was for the first two acts, I would have rated it much lower.However, the third act is such a left turn that you would expect to hate it, but in fact, the opposite is true. It is such a weird twist that you as a viewer are wanting to walk away. But Wan is brave enough to stick with the ridiculous twist with confidence and determination that you can only admire it.Don't expect a deep horror movie, just enjoy it. And if you don't enjoy it, still stick with it to watch that third act, I will never forget this act and am curious what Wan has to say about this movie.",Malignant

One of the best things I've seen in a while. There wasn't any references to current social events which was a plus. Just pure action, horror on the edge thrills. Will definitely purchase this blu ray. Hopefully we get more movies as cool and entertaining as this. It was along the lines of a modern Nightmare on Elm St. Type movie, but even better than most.

It started out sketchy, got interesting, then ended completely off the rails. It has elements of 1970s DePalma horror, combined with Wan's Dead Silence and Saw, some Shyamalan, a splash of Lynch's Eraserhead, and maybe (unbelievably!) a bit of Tarantino. The trailer was great, although misleading, since it sold this as something completely different. I want to say what's lacking here is the Wan/Whannel magic ingredient.

To me, it clearly came off as a deliberate homage to horror flicks of the 80s and 90s. I think he knew what he wanted to make and just went for it. Yes, it gets a bit crazy in the 3rd act but I was all in for the ride. I had fun! Also the cinematography is masterclass here. Clearly the product of an experienced filmmaker. I also found some of the music to be memorable and unnerving.In summary, I've been getting tired of the ol' Annabelle-quietly-stares-at-you-for-30-seconds-and-then-a-spooky-ghost-pops-out formula with the Conjuring series, and I found it refreshing to see something different.My rating scale: 10 - will go down in history, 9 - awesome, 8 - great, 7 - good, 6 - above average, 5 - completely average, nothing new to see, 1 - offended, upset I wasted my time, (2-4 = somewhere in between)",Malignant

443,jayjay21718,I'll take it.,7,11 October 2021,So gave it a 7. Mostly becuase I feel it deserves more then a 6. For originality. Not going to lie I kinda saw it coming one with the word malignant usually referring to tumors. The fact that she can see or never move her body but can see everything. So I was mostly watching to figure out their explanation. My thoughts were definitely conjoined twin. But if they removed the brother. Why refer to him as a tumor and where would he get a body from. But when he did the third murder of the doctor In His room and I saw the leg placement I was like well obviously the body isn't shaped the same. Always running backwards etc. Yet with forward arms. And the fact that mostly all you saw was an eye In a mass of hair. But I was wondering how would you remove a twin and him still have a body. So that couldn't be it. But if she had a face on the back of her head. How would the husband or anyone ever figure it out. And what was the deformed creature in the beginning. So when they finally show yes conjoined and body was removed except for the head that they pushed inside the skull. Which was odd but ok. It explained all the blood on the pillow and why she kept bleeding. Sadly there was never ever a mention of the scars she would of had on her back and neck. I feel they could do hinted at it a bit. Maybe. Husband or sister always mentioning why they never go to the pool or beach or why her hair is always down show that she is consciously hiding it. But yeah couldn't give it higher then the 7 since I did find some of it ridiculous or predictable. I did not think that the tour lady was the mom that was a surprise for along with the head being jammed into the skull. But I just couldn't understand peoples thought process mom going down the dark black corroded before plugging in the light the doctor not wondering how the window opened. And water led to his closet and same with emily / Madison and the back door. Just didn't make sense that and then letting her back into a crime scene the first time. But him eating the fetus. Was interesting the significance of the head trauma awaking him. But couldn't give too many points when they did odd things and the fact that they had a fully functioning vcr. The fact that. Records like that were jsut left in and abandoned facility. Not touched I just thought-those things were odd. And the one flash drive out of five only having that small amount of information despite all the records. Still available. But over all a movie I would recommend anyone to watch atleast once. And gets originality points and kudos to the cinematography the scene transitions were well done the angles were great there were a lot of great choices made when filming that I have to give it props. But yeah. This movie wasn't perfect but it wasn't bad either. So I think it well deserved it's 7.,Malignant

453,Edward_Daniells,The curse of horror movies!,6,13 September 2021,"(does not contain spoiler!)--Evil, new film by James Wan the much acclaimed horror director thanks to the Evil Summon movies. Delving into the Review I will leave a short synopsis of the film.Madison is transfixed by shocking visions of gruesome murders, and her torment is made worse when she discovers that these waking dreams are, in fact, terrifying realities.Q: I actually had a lot of fun in this film, it's a very positive point that I must emphasize because amidst its ups and downs the film managed to keep me fixated on wanting to watch and find out what will happen next. James Wan's direction is something I particularly like a lot, he uses some very good camera positions and movements, especially in a sequel, it even becomes tense when he puts together a good camera position, a sequel and a chase scene, in the first few minutes of the film something similar happens and I was really tense because until that moment we didn't know what we were dealing with, thus generating the fear of the unknown and fearing for what could happen to the character since several moments the film breaks expectations that we have of films of the genre thus leaving the scenes of the first act a little more unpredictable, causing the viewer an affliction in not knowing what we are dealing with and not knowing what can happen.--The movie has an aversion more to action and investigation than to the horror itself, in fact I felt very little terror, having only a couple of jumpscare that really scared me, in the scenes of the first act, several scenes could be put to good use. To create the tension since we didn't know what the creature was, but the film decides to take a more frantic turn so the tension is broken with a constant action scene and this is much more reinforced at the end of the second act and in the whole of the third. Speaking exclusively of the third act I was very disappointed, because the film could take several directions that in my opinion would fit better for a conclusion, but the direction the film takes I couldn't swallow right, it truly becomes an action movie, with a rain of gore and blood and well-choreographed scenes. In particular I didn't like it, because mostly the first act it keeps a good horror air even, and as we know more about the creature it becomes a very good idea to take advantage of in a horror movie, but in the end it becomes an action movie. With horror.--I must emphasize that I enjoy the soundtrack a lot, it fits well with the moments, especially if you pay attention there is a track that is a instrumental of a very famous song in which to make you understand what really can be happening there. Famous little spoiler between the lines.--Overall I must say that Maligno is a good film, a very original idea and a good direction, but the film lacks a lot in its script, as it starts in a good way and gradually decays until it reaches a point where the what matters is the action, the idea could be put to much better use. On the other hand it is a very fun movie and worth watching, I managed to entertain myself watching it, as much as I was disappointed I didn't feel that it was wasted time in vain because it was fun to watch. Overall I believe James Wan's Evil (2021) is a film grade: 6.Good idea but questionable execution, the curse of horror movies.",Malignant

One minute I felt like I was watching Insidious and one minute I felt like I was watching Dead Silence. At one point I was even reminded of the Saw series.

457,KirkFogg,"May work with the right audience, but objectively bad.",3,11 September 2021,"I went in to ""Malignant"" completely blind aside from having seen it's very well made movie poster. Serious kudos belong to the graphic designer for creating such an enticing poster for such a strange and frankly terrible movie. The movie begins within a flashback in 1993, and the acting at this point was fiercely over the top and reminiscent of an eighties soap opera. The special practical effects in the opening (which were introduced early) were shockingly bad. I soon began to wonder if maybe this was a purposefully campy movie. Over the top cheese often really works when leaned into the correct amount. This unfortunately wouldn't be the case. Shortly after the opening and the titles, the movie began to take itself seriously again-aside from some pretty painful ensemble acting. They threw in a few spooks here and there in the first half hour, and I was entertained enough to keep watching. As the film continued to unfold, more and more jarring plot elements were introduced that directly contradicted one another. About two thirds in to the movie, I accepted that this would just be a run of the mill B minus horror film. Then, it happened. I don't want to ruin too much for you, but the movie takes a complete left turn and seemingly switches genre to something much worse. It's at this point that the movie takes a hard nosedive and you're left speechless-mouth agape. What were they thinking? Many people had to green light this movie, and it still turned out this way. The reasons the movie deserves a three are because of the occasional genuinely creepy imagery, certain well done cinematography shots, and outright creativity in some regards. Still, even with absolutely no expectations going in, I was left wildly disappointed, bewildered and unsatisfied.",Malignant
458,bayareamike,I didn't think this was a comedy?!,5,11 September 2021,"So in the beginning, we see the main character and the outside of her house from the street several times in the film. The house from the street is maybe as wide as 20', maybe 25' wide. Didn't look too long either from the side view. Anyway, why does the ""inside"" of the house look like it was filmed in a massive mansion with rooms, hallways, windows & furniture everywhere! The house from the ""outside"" looks like maybe 1000' sq feet per floor. It also clearly shows no room to the left of the door. There is a wall. But amazingly ""inside"" there's a huge room to the left of the door! Wow how'd that happen? I thought there was a wall there?? Someone said to themselves ""oh, no one will notice"". Umm, yes people are going to notice when in one scene there's a wall and in the next scene from inside there's suddenly a large room where the wall should be!All this might sound petty, but when I see location mistakes that could have been avoided if they wanted to, it makes me question the rest of the film.

461,DigitalShark1,"Enjoyable, but forgettable.",7,6 October 2021,"Malignant is the new film by indie turned mainstream director James Wan, who's come a long way from making a proof of concept of Saw for $2,000. There's a lot of directors who definitely feel like they give up once they make millions of dollars, so I give James Wan credit for at least still trying.Malignant is about a woman named Madison, an woman whose nightmares about murders suddenly begin to become reality after her abusive husband smashes her head against a wall. Throughout the movie, we get glimpses of the killer and learn more of the strange relationship between the two.Malignant plays out like a thousand other horror movies and decent twilight zone episodes. You got your vulnerable protagonist who can see the impending doom, but of course, no one believes her. It's not a groundbreaking trope, but it's not bad by any means. Malignant for the first two acts sticks to a formula that you're definitely familiar with if you've even seen a few horror parodies before, but it's still enjoyable. You see the murders coming and you more or less know exactly how they'll get murdered too, but it's still entertaining to see evil doctors get killed in really cool lit sets.Towards the third act, Malignant takes a drastic shift. It reveals it's huge twist and becomes more of a bad action movie. I won't give away the twist, but the more you think about it, the less it makes sense. It's almost too ridiculous to find scary at that point, but does keep the disturbing element the film goes for.All in all, I got my money's worth, but I'll probably never think about it again.",Malignant

Strange though, given the twist, that the villain seemed to have super strength, coordination and agility while doing everything backwards in a woman's body.It seemed to hop genres, from campy sci fi, to ghost horror, to slasher, to action movie. But Wan is a very good director and actually pulled off each one.Overall, I'm very mixed about this film.",Malignant

It's one of those movies that leaves you wondering, ""what the hell did I just watch"". This film is full of gore and violence and a few scares here and there. I find it fascinating that every little detail from the movie is somehow connected to the ending. I will say this, you will be blown away by the ending.

469,KyleBel,A great horror movie that could have been better if not for the twist,7,11 September 2021,"This was honestly a great horror movie, and it was very serious up until the big reveal/twist.Now everyone who paid attention knew that our main character (Madison) had some kind of mental disorder and Benjamin was in her head, but the twist of Ben actually being a parasitic twin who lives inside her brain and was woken up by hitting her head against the wall allowing him to pop out of the back of her head, paralyze her, and take full control of her body turning her into a backwards killing machine was something I did not see coming at all. In a way that was refreshing, in another way it took a movie I was really enjoying (The suspense and horror had me) and made it almost laughable.I really wish that they had kept it more grounded in reality and made it so that Ben's brain was still inside of Madison's head (Not half of his body), and this is how he was able to control her body.They also never explained Ben's and now Madison's ability to control electricity, make phone calls, and the super human strength. I mean since they went all campy horror, why did they not just say that they were using experimental drugs on Benjamin that gave him these super powers, and thus since they shared the same body Madison had these super powers as well.Either way I wish they had avoided that twist all together and stayed in reality and made this a true psychological, horror/thriller that was believable.

Its really a sequence of awesome cgi and fancy camera work put together. And sadly i am James Wan's fan.,Malignant
472,IzzyMaeDoorite,Equivalent of a roller coaster,8,12 September 2021,"Malignant is so bizzare, fast-pacing, shocking and entertaining that there should be a specific terminology for such flicks: a hyperhorror. Want a slasher? Get a load of gut-wrenching murders occurring in a really short period with flying body parts and stabbed faces. Feel like supernatural? Get a brash, mind-blowing plot twist that makes a viewer question if creators are *that* deranged. Need action? Breathtaking chase scene that is so long (for a horror film) and intense it's almost a burden. Need a bit of mystery? Also nailed it.Malignant took everything what's usable in its genre and swiftly turned it to 100. Unfortunately, everything has its price, and in this case it's film's authenticity and acting. James Wan's anticipated comeback is simply not scary in the way The Conjuring or Insidious used to be. It's a shame but a forgivable one. And acting is the least strong quality of Malignant because Annabelle Wallis, although an unquestionably good actresses, is not a scream queen like Jamie Lee Curtis or, at least, Tiffany Shepis. Wallis' character screams comically often and never gives a classic horror female protagonist vibes. She previously starred in mediocre Annabelle produced by Wan, so his decision to let her take a revanche looks pretty questionable. This part just wasn't for her. She tried her best though.Summary: easily this year's most memorable horror film that we all deserve. James Wan proves he's still got it. Visual effects creators are at liberty to believe they're worthy of the upcoming Academy Awards. Annabelle Wallis should stick to slow-burners.",Malignant

There's an uncertainty in the film's trajectory, yet its congruence of arbitration just made sense. Well, oxy my moron.There were a lot of signature Wan moments that I appreciated inordinately; stellar Bishara score and immaculately composed lighting.

He has talent and his balls to try new stuff is admirable. I thought I was watching a horror movie for the first act. It goes from jump scares and gore to off the wall gore and Matrix like action. The premise is soooo zany it makes me smile writing this. It's a fun movie just advertised wrong. This really isn't a horror film. It's kind of in its own category.

No one has done this particular subject in this way and it is thrilling free form, balls to the walls, incredible FX and set pieces. That 3rd act choreography, conglomeration of lightning-fast martial arts moves: Matrix, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, murderous Bruce Lee - No idea how that was accomplished but loved it like I was a teenager again; unapologetically gory, bonkers, and beautifully filmed.I feel sorry for the public leaving 1-starred reviews who don't know their film history or anything significant about the horror genre.",Malignant

69/100What Wan did with this film feels incredibly off-centre and unorthodox. Coming from a pretty well-established director in the horror department gives away a fresh sensation, something that hasn't quite happened in a long time.Malignant tumbles during it's first and second act from lacking a sense of originality in its screenplay. Though very easy to follow, it sinks into several tropes and clichés that would most likely present themselves in any other WB horror film. The cinematography, despite feeling daring in some scenes, hops between going safe and audacious with its shots, making the overall picture seem disconnected. The soundtrack suffers from it as well.The climax and final act are, easily, the best aspects of the film. Unlike the rest of it, the screenplay and overall concept are better polished and achieved. Truly one of the best plot twists I've seen in some time now.Though Malignant suffers the Conjuring treatment, not be engaging enough due to its cliché storyline until it makes its way towards the ending, it feels like a step up from what Wan has carried out in the past, at least in my opinion.",Malignant

In reading reviews from professional critics apparently you have to wade through the first two thirds of the film to set you up for the final third. That doesn't work for me.One of the things that I found irritating was the score by Joseph Bishara. Someone would say something seemingly mundane and then we'd get hit with this over-the-top spooky music. One of the first movies with its own score was the 1933 ""King Kong."" As the story went on it had no score playing for the first third. By the time they got to Skull Island, Max Steiner's score subtly kicked in. By the time he's rampaging in New York the score grabbed you by the shirt and repeatedly slapped you. You never realized it because it so perfectly synched with the images on the screen. The score should be a condiment for the action, not a crutch for a lifeless picture.",Malignant

493,glennmeerten06,80's horror is back! For better and for worse...,7,1 September 2021,"James Wan has been one of the most interesting voices in modern horror. With his latest venture, Wan reaffirms his grasp on the genre yet again. Malignant is an absurd concoction of all the best and cheesiest ingredients of 80's slasher goodness. Complete with a unique, signature murder weapon and a soon to be iconic killer.Madison finds herself in a horrifying predicament after a brutal murder takes place in her own home. She's being haunted by a killer as well as visions of his future victims. What follows is a disturbing mystery with a lot more camp than you might expect.Wan's direction keeps the film engaging and genuinely terrifying. The horror scènes are marinaded in Wan's signature style and they're all the better for it. He even manages to put some impressive action sequences on the screen. His work on Aquaman has clearly been fruitful.The score is a mixed bag. I found the compositions to be more distracting than compelling. It's unfortunate because his scores have been one of my favorite elements of Wan's other franchises like Insidious or The Conjuring.Another issue I had with the film is its tone. Malignant is a love letter to 80's horror but it can't seem to mesh this homage with the serious modern subject matters and tone. It's not always clear to me, what is supposed to be comedic and what is unintentionally absurd. Especially the film's conclusion might divide audiences. I found it to be hilariously absurd in a good way. Others might find it insultingly stupid. Either way, the film is ambitious and bold. After the underwhelming Conjuring outing, Malignant provides some much appreciated James Wan horror. That's always a win in my book.Make of that as you will.",Malignant

As for the film itself, it never intends to be taken fully seriously, so those factors that would come as evident flaws to certain eyes are definitely to be perceived as purposely virtues by the right ones.I mean, we're talking about a slasher drama with underlying inclinations to comedy that serves as an homage to classic scary movies. The main intentionality of those were never realism or thoughtful stories, but plain and pain entertainment. So, I can't come with an answer as to why this should be otherwise.As for the rest, the soundtrack makes a way for itself with a combination of vintage/modern, generic to meaningful sounds that also adds to the ambiguously flamboyant aspect of the movie. The cinematography is well made, and the special effects are pretty solid. The acting is mediocre for the most part, as it should be. -I mean, it is certainly not a remarkable aspect technically speaking,
but if you wanna have a complete classic horror experience, then it is a must-have, isn't it?.-So, if you make the way through this movie enough to get the idea of it, you will probably enjoy it. The thing is, the entertainment factor may be a certainty anyway. Yep.",Malignant

I'd call it hypocrisy, but I might be underplaying it then. ""Malignant"" isn't ""Saw"", and it isn't ""Insidious"", nor is it ""The Conjuring"", and that's a good thing. James Wan, as good and successful a genre director as any out there over the past two decades, could've played it safe and just kept revisiting these worlds in some shape or form over the next two decades. But, as is the case with people that are true to their craft, he evolves and, in the process, swings for the fences. As far as I'm concerned, it's a success, and then some. ""Malignant"" is just a joy to behold - there's so much history of horror cinema crammed into its 110 minutes, but it's done by an expert and, I dare say, an auteur, so it leaves no feeling of a ripoff whatsoever, just a signature Wan movie, reinventing himself yet again. In some other - or, should I say, many other hands - this story runs wild and crashes into a wall. And this is precisely what I fail to understand about the movie's reception, as far as the film critics are concerned (I understand it might be too much for an audience at the moment): you have this gem, this candy, this ancestor of the Apenine (the fan, the leather, the weapon! To go along with an amazing score by Wan's creepy composer, brilliant Joseph Bishara - mamma mia!) with great set pieces that reminded me of ""The Thing"" and ""Terminator"" (you'll recognize them), and you're nitpicking its logic and characterization, as if it aspires to be the bloody Bergman! (They knew what they're doing with the Annabelle Wallis casting.) To all the genre aficionados out there - support this movie, help him stay afloat on this site, don't let the bad reviews keep people from seeing it.

It might have worked better for me if it answered some more questions that the twist of it being her parasitic twin brought up to me. So she/he have some supernatural/psychic abilities? Because how was Gabriel able to call the detectives while they were questioning her right in front of them? And why do the lights flicker when Gabriel takes over? Also how does he have such super strength and fighting abilities with her body? These are the things that leave me questioning how to feel about the movie now. It's like it should be a comic book origin story (like Venom) but the movie's trailer leads you to believe it's a straight horror movie. I get not wanting to give away the full twist but it seems a bit misleading in marketing which quite a few movies seem to be doing lately and it's not fair to the people who want to see what they are led to believe they will be watching.

522,CronenbergsMonster,"Campy, Schlocky Fun",7,16 September 2021,"A lot of reviewers on here seem to have completely missed the point of this film - it's a tribute to campy B-Movie films, but on a bigger budget (Wan specifically stated Italian Giallo and Brian DePalma films as the main influence, but there's a heavy dose of Sam Raimi as well). A lot of this is most likely due to poor marketing for the film. The studio clearly didn't know how to sell this movie and decided to push it as another Conjuring-esque film by Wan. It is not this. I don't want to spoil any of the intentionally funny, bananas charm of this film, but it is wayyyyyy more along the lines of Wan's outrageous Furious 7 and Aquaman. If you love B-movie horror camp, you will seriously enjoy this film. The direction is also slick and superb throughout. The hammy acting and cheesy one-liners are just icing on the cake. I highly recommend going into the film blind, like I did, as it makes all of the silliness that much more suprising/fun. Again, DO NOT go into this expecting a serious horror film. If you don't enjoy intentionally silly horror (think Drag Me To Hell, Peter Jackson's Braindead, Re-Animator etc.) with INTENTIONALLY cheesy dialog and over-the-top reveals and set pieces, this film is not for you.",Malignant

The acting is really bad from all the characters, they felt amateurs for me. There's so much inconsistencies and stupid details all along that got me furious. Sometimes there's stupid or goofy movie that we can enjoy because it's well played and produced. Not here. And the CGI..... so bad ! The main actress running with a coat backward, that felt so childish. Is that supposed to be innovative and smart? I didn't buy it at all.

530,fandomly,"All Over The Place, Flat Characters, Cringe-y Twist",1,8 September 2021,"Pros:
1. Cinematography
2. The title
3. The poster
4. The trailer looked decent. Sigh. I hate when trailers lie.Cons:
1. Cinematography. The movie just tries TOO hard with it that while it delivers some interesting angles, all shown in the trailer, the rest is just too over the top. We get it. You like CGI and interesting angles, now can you just tell a good story? No, then sorry I wasted my time.2. Flat characters. The characters are boring, flat, lifeless, created from a million cliches.3. Too referential. The first half of the movie you'll swear you're watching Lights Out, it's so shamelessly identical. The second off is like watching The X-Files Episode about the ""secret"" twin that detaches itself and murders people, except here, the secret twin is more like Freddy Kruger meets a Marvel Superhero. And that's where it goes wrong. It mixes too many things and none of them work. It's just this weird mix of I'm bored because you're trying way too hard to be edgy and cool and scare people.4. The story just isn't good. It's really, really stupid, and literal.5. The twist is dumb. I wanted to be more open-minded, like, okay, a throw back to 80s horror, fine, it's stupid but let me roll with it, but then there was nothing more to the ""trick"". It was a dumb 80s twist, and thats it. It didnt save the movie. It didnt make it better. Then it just got cringey, and I was like, how many millions of dollars went into this and why aren't better writers/directors out there? Right, because the rich ones are paying asian companies to post fake 10 star reviews to gaslight people into thinking this was actually a great film. It wasn't. But will it make money? Probably, because a good concept, a good trailer, and a ton of fake reviews will do that.But if you want a horror fan's opinion? It was a waste of time.",Malignant

532,Joaoangelo76,"Poorly Written, but James Wan Helps a lot",6,13 September 2021,"Malignant was promising a lot. I will say that I was fairly excited for this movie. Given that James Wan is incredibly talented when it comes to creating atmosphere and great jumpscares.The movie starts out with pretty cheesy dialogue and a sense of ""I've seen this before"". It's very clear to me that the biggest problem of this movie is Akela Cooper's script. Most of the characters in this movie with the exception of Annabelle Walli's character are crappy. The investigators of the movie are the most generic as they possibly could be. Madison's sister is actually okay, however, her role in the story keeps changing all the time and you never really 100% know what she is doing. Also, the abusive relationship portrayed in the beginning of the film could be much more layered, in order to make it more believable. And the plot points are, mostly, solved with cliché solutions, which doesn't help. I also think James Wan could've benefited more from quiet moments with Madison, in order to show more of her anguish and inner pain.The monster, Gabriel, is very original and quite scary. His role in the film is plausible and contributes to the overall theme of Malignant.I really enjoyed the twist halfway through the movie. It caught me off guard, making it surprising.One thing that is very important to point out is the mashup of genres that James Wan does in this movie. That actually was what drew me into wanting to watch this film. And it doesn't disappoint. The mashup blends really well with the story and it never feels less than necessary. Some scenes in Malignant are only as good as they are because of James Wan's direction.If you never seen horror movies, don't start with this one. But, if you're fan of the genre, this might be the fresh perspective on it that you're looking for.",Malignant
533,spamcatcher-10034,Thanks you James,8,13 September 2021,"Wan does Suspiria. From the poster art to the euro (gorgeous-there I said it) looks of Mrs Wallis, this is a nice throwback and a fitting love letter to a certain era of Italian cinema. The script is fittingly modern (but not too much), even if the chroma filters are somewhat shaky compared to the masters of the genre. But he makes it up with a shot of the innards of a VCR, to show his 20th century bona fides.There are even shades of Channel Zero and yes, that's a good thing, even if the reverse-body thing is getting tired, all hail Troy James who invented it.Also, bangs....As I was writing all these interesting things, the third act started, and I started grinning stupidly andThat's what movies are for.Go forth, James, you artist you. Melding 80s synth cheese music with 80s-lets-follow-this-idea-as-far-as-itll-take-us attitude, the result is refreshing. Yes, that's what it's all about. Forget MCU and horror-by-committee (sorry Mr Blum I like your work), I'm so happy that this here is a little piece of innocence lost. Memories of Troma indeed.So Suspiria meets Troma (with a budget). Not too shabby for horror fans!Now if you liked this, I'm sure you know where to find the 80s American classics. But do yourself a favor: go watch Berberian Sound Studio for starters. And then Bava and Argento.Also, a personal message: tell Mrs Pugh, the greatest actress of her generation, to drop bad wicker man remakes and look for scripts such as this.And thanks James for the memories and for a great cinema moment.",Malignant
534,Matt-Canalcon,A creepy & brutal return to horror for James Wan.,8,11 September 2021,"Malignant was marketed as James Wan going back to the horror genre, teased with some giallo flavor and a mystery involving a murderer, some visions, and maybe connections with our protagonist played by Annabelle Wallis.Let's start with the obvious... Holy crap, the third act of this movie had my jaw dropped to the floor and I've seen a lot of horror flicks. It's special in a way that even though you might have an idea of where it's going, the final act will surprise the hell out of you... and it's brutal, scary & intense. I loved where they went with this story.It's not always hitting the right notes, best example is the use of the Pixies' Where Is My Mind? That felt totally out of place, and they bring it a couple of times during the movie. It's a minor nitpick but Malignant does have the feeling that it's turned up to 11 most of the time and it embraces its campiness. I won't deny that it's messy in parts but I was thoroughly enjoying myself watching it, it's a ballsy film by James Wan. If you're a fan of horror you'll definitely notice some homages & winks but it's never overwhelming, you can tell he's trying to tell his own story, and boy did he nailed it for me.This won't be for everyone, but I feel like it was made for crazy people like myself.",Malignant

I even saw a few reviews saying this movie is camp, to those viewers I beg you to go look up what camp really means. This is not a commentary on horror. It is a mess of poor writing (story and dialogue), bad acting (especially from the cops), and overuse of bad CGI (in particular the blood splatters). From the first scene I could tell the film was going to be over the top. The only shining factor was the cinematography and shot design. The main actress was obviously wearing a wig that wasn't set properly, so the issue she has in the back of her head ended up being quite obvious. The final action sequence looked like a video game. Happy that it was available to stream and didn't have to waste any money to see this in theaters. James Wan has traded in his sparkle and fear factor for easy blockbuster money.

But this one didn't have a single effective jump-scare.To be fair I guess it does make you laugh a bit, and that appears to be intentional... but it just doesn't really fit together, it ends up feeling too in-between something like a parody and a movie that takes itself seriously and excelling at neither.I would skip this one, unless you really have an itch for horror and have nothing better to watch.",Malignant

When the film revealed it's secrets, it was really entertaining watching them play around with it. Hell, I wanted more from it.I think this could have been truly epic if they worked on it a bit with the story, got rid of a a couple things, and went even scarier for that horror element (no complaints on that comic relief peppered in there).Anyway, cool stuff in here, worth a watch in my opinion, always good to see something new and fresh!",Malignant

Like just to catch him lacking that hard I just don't get the motive of her doing that to him but I guess it was a clever way to trick the audience and see more gore but yeah definitely worth a watch and loving a lot of James Wans work it was nice to see another good movie by him.,Malignant

560,DeaditeGaz92,James Wan introduced modern horror audiences to Giallo,10,11 September 2021,"Five years after he directed the fantastic The Conjuring 2, James Wan is back with what I believe to be his best film yet. Malignant was marketed to be something similar to Wan's very own Insidious, this film couldn't be any further from that description. Whilst people going into this film expecting what the trailer promised will no doubt be disappointed and it's certainly not a film that's going to be for everyone in general, this love letter to the horror genre as a whole immediately won me over and I truly believe this is a modern horror masterpiece that needs to be seen by all horror fans. It's always obvious when a horror film is made by a horror fan and that's very much the case here as Wan goes on to use the formula that Tarantino does with all of his films; he takes his influences and works them into something incredible and something that feels very original despite wearing its influences on its sleeve.There are elements of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1 & 2) to be found here as well as various other camp 80s classics but the most noticeable influence that really shines through is Giallo. It's a bold move to release a mainstream modern Giallo film considering a lot of modern horror audiences won't get all the nods and the deliberately over the top and camp performances, and might dismiss this as being a bad film but it's far from it. There's a certain amount of humour surrounding so much that happens here to the point that it borders on satire and it worked so well, blending in with the more serious scenes brilliantly. What Wan has done here truly is a work of genius. Opera, Tenebrae, Blood and Black Lace, Suspiria, The Washing Machine, Phenomena, there's little homages to so many classic Giallos and as a fan of the Italian sub genre, this was incredible to see on the big screen at my local Odeon; it's really something I wasn't expecting.Influences aside, as it's own film, it works perfectly, providing a mind blowing twist that I'm sure will go down as one of the most unpredictable twists in horror history. I didn't see it coming at all and I loved how over the top it was, such a ridiculous yet brilliant idea. The cast provide melodramatic performances that all look like they've been delivered straight from any of the films this is influenced by. Out of everyone, I'd say both Annabelle Wallis and Maddie Hasson provide the best performances which basically means they have more scenes that can be taken seriously than everyone else. Michole Briana White is another standout as Regina Moss, a character who I really hope returns for a sequel if one is ever made. Gabriel, played by Ray Chase, is one of the best horror antagonists we've had in such a long time.Speaking like if Freddy Krueger was in a Giallo flick and looking absolutely horrific, this chilling villain comes completed with a gold dagger, black gloves and a big black coat, looking very menacing and creepy at all times. The kills are insanely gory, fully earning its 18 rating in the UK, starting out with some offscreen kills and graphic aftermaths before going all out for its third act in a scene that goes from being reminiscent of The Terminator to a fantastically choreographed action scene that is jarringly stylish. It's not all blood and guts, Wan's signature style shines through and we get more than a few scenes of slow building dread that had me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is stunning, making excellent use of stylish lighting and shadows to create so much eerie atmosphere throughout. It's through the cinematography where we see the Dario Argento and Mario Bava influences are very visible. The soundtrack is used very effectively with a phenomenal score from regular Wan collaborator, Joseph Bishara who continuously heightens the tone and often provides little nods to classic scores by Goblin.",Malignant

One of the funniest lines was ""we can't remove it without killing her so we'll cram it back into her skull."" Yea. There's so much extra room in there, maybe if that character was as brainless as the writer...
Watch at your own risk. The risk of falling asleep during the first three quarters. Then the final quarter that really needed The Benny Hill theme.

Total fun, total escapism, total immersion in a well crafted giallo-vibed old-school form-factor, that actually makes you think. Well done, James Wan.

It feels like a campy (in a good way) 80s horror flick and not something you'd expect from James Wan but does that make it bad? No. In my opinion, Malignant is something very different that we have received in the last few years in horror cinema and I applaud Wan for that but the risks taken will surely alienate most audience. Watch the film and decide for yourself, no one can explain you the experience that is ""Malignant""",Malignant

The soundtrack was something that stuck with me, another positive element, was eerie and worked well with the atmosphere of the movie.Yes there were some plot holes and moments where you laugh in a bad way or sigh.

Again, I did like the visuals and story and think it's quite entertaining.""Malignant is terrible and fascinating at the same timeObjectively speaking, its a really bad movie with cringy lines, some really bad acting and weird plot wholes. Highlight is Stacey driving, all alone and with no clear argument why the archives would still be there, to this deserted research hospital, a straight copy of Batman's Arkham Asylum, and parks her car literally on the edge of a cliff. Also the doctors didnt age a bit in 20-30 years. But noone cared.Regardless, it also seems the director didnt care too much and even did some of the weird stuff (like the parking and non-aging of doctors) on purpose.I found the story weird enough to keep it entertaining, cant find a better word for it, and despite the horrible aspects would still weirdly enough recommend it. For the fans it at least contains some good slashing and gore.Oh and now the lead character found some superpowers in her skull, I at least expect the research center to turn out to be really Arkham Asylum and her teaming up with Batman in the next movies.""",Malignant

(Not by the lead or supporting actresses) Some of the scenes are right out of an 80's Sam Raimi movie...and that is what makes it fun! I liked the plot ""twist"" in the 3rd act as it was unexpected. If you go into this movie with very low expectations, I think you will have a fun time. Especially in the 3rd act. It's not Insidious or Conjuring quality. It's more of a Tales from the Crypt movie.

The characters are shallow, it feels campy, and the reveal is a testosterone infusion. The music sets the mood they are going for. Instead of keeping it stark and serious, the theme is a flashback to repeat melody horror. Think of combining the Pixies' ""Where is my Mind"" with the themes like HALLOWEEN & PHANTASM.I watched on HBO Max, after working a long day. I have to admit that my body was fighting how tired I was. That is, until the ""wow"" part. Then I was wide awake! I even brought my son in, so we could watch the finale again. Now, I want to watch the whole thing again, so I can see the movie from the revealed perspective.I'm trying not to say anything too specific, but this movie is a mishmash of plodding thriller and thrash horror. Some parts reminded me of physical FX 80's/90's movies like THE HIDDEN, Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE (just a little!), and THE TERMINATOR, yet most of it is not that.

602,forchennfederation,A WTF Movie in the Best Way,9,9 October 2021,"James Wan was a filmmaker who I have an appreciation for with movies such the Conjuring films that he directed, Furious 7, and Aquaman. Even for he make movies that I wasn't crazy about, I still find his talents as a director to be strong. So, going into this film, Malignant, all I knew was that it was a new horror film by Wan, and that was it; I never even watched any of the trailers for this film, so I went into it totally cold and not knowing what to expect. And, I came out of it pretty satisfied because this was a blast. So, here's why.But, first things first, the basic jist of the plot in Malignant is that a young woman named Madison (played by Annabelle Wallis) gets visions of gruesome murders by a mysterious killer. And, that's as far as I'm gonna go into the plot because I genuinely want people to go into this film as cold as possible; there are twists and turns in this movie that shocked me and made me exclaim, ""What the f***?!""
The movie kinda starts out as a paranormal type of scenario with Madison running through her house trying to escape an evil presence, like something out of a Conjuring or Insidious film, but then the film turns into more of a slasher film with a mystery element going on and that's when the film really had me hooked to see where it went; and, boy howdy, where it went was bonkers yet awesome and the pieces come together in a way where it's certainly crazy but it kinda makes sense given the context of what's going on.The film has quite the amount of disturbing/scary sequences with the killer committing his sinister deeds and there is plenty of grisly and gory moments involving some pretty brutal kills, especially in the third act where things get crazy. There was even a point where the gore made me squeamish to where I could barely take it, and that's complimented by some pretty great practical effects and sound design.Now, I heard from people that the acting isn't too strong. I won't say it's Oscar-worthy, but I thought it was good overall, especially from Annabelle Wallis.James Wan's direction is also very strong; he knows how to shoot a film and there are several sequences that consist of long shots that really make the experience all the more immersive. I watched this film at home on HBO Max and I still found myself entranced by the film on a visual level. There are certain sequences with a vibrant color palette that make the film seem like it was inspired by Italian horror films from the 1970s and one could tell that Wan has a sort of love and appreciation for that corner of horror cinema that really shines through here, and he does a great job at capturing that in this film.So, when it's all said and done, Malignant was such a blast of a horror flick. It may have had some silly parts here and there, but nothing that was distracting to the point where the film lost me. It has some awesome, bloody moments, it was intense and scary, it has an engaging story that had me wondering where it was going only to be totally shocked in the best way by where it went, and I had so much fun as a result of all that. And, as a horror fan, I totally recommend it.It's a film that's pretty out there, but that's pretty much what makes it so awesome.",Malignant

The rest of it barely passed as a competent film. Bad acting, generic music (I hope the Pixies got paid because they straight ripped off ""Where is My Mind""), and a horrendous story made this film almost unwatchable. I was really looking forward to this, too. There were a couple of good ideas buried within, but they were surrounded by so much drivel that one can hardly stop to admire a clever moment.

The writing was a little subpar as many times the characters seem to put themselves in harms way on purpose like ""don't kill me as they're running into the knife"".

This is the most original, stupid, crazy, off the wall reveal I've ever seen in a horror film. Probably the most original horror villain since Jeepers Creepers.Swooping cinematic angles, epic cinematography, and a bombastic score - more than the film needed or deserved at times - but also appreciated.This film will without a doubt divide audiences.

There are films that are self-conscious about how silly they are and it makes them worth a laugh. This movie takes itself seriously, and that's its greatest undoing.A big skip, if you ask me.

Dialogue were ridiculously over the top, ridiculous and borderline stupid.

619,Jjfilmeyfilm,Plain,4,1 November 2021,"Posted on Letterboxd on 23 September 2021.This is your typical slasher-type horror, boring cardboard-cutout characters, no scares other than ""muh goarey jumpscare"" and a kind of derpy killer. For people who are into that kind of thing, the kills are alright, but some of the later ones feel more action than horror.It does have one major redeeming quality that makes it stand out from all of the other gorey, tropey crap (and in consequence, stopped it from getting 2/10); that is the aforementioned ""twist"", which I won't talk about here. Experience it yourself, nerds.To add: this film kind of reminded me of 'Upgrade', for some reason. Does anyone else have these vibes? Am I just going crazy?4/10.",Malignant

The acting is so bad and it never gets better, so I jump on IMDB and read the reviews. They say it's not as bad as some of the reviews, so I push on. At around 1:15 into the movie, the ceiling falls out, literally, and from there on, it turns into the most ridiculous waste of time that makes you question why you are still watching. As you continue watching, you realize that you have been bamboozled. This is not a horror movie, although it has been set up as one, it has now turned into The Matrix meets Evil Dead, except it's not funny, at all. ""Call in the National Guard"" , yes please do and put an end to this abomination. I've now wasted this much time in this movie, let's finish this, it can't get worse, can it?

626,isaiahc-72408,Different but not better,7,25 September 2021,"James Wan definitely tried something new in Malignant. Seeing Madison have to watch the people die in a stand-still position because of her temporary paralysis was interesting, but the killer, aka her other half, didn't seem to be all that scary. He was really just funny to look at and it was like he was born with all those powers and assassin-like skills. The deaths in this film were definitely brutal, but seemed to happen to quickly for me to even acknowledge and they were to characters that I didn't even know almost at all. The plot twist is amazing and creepy. I especially loved the sequence where Kekoa was chasing Gabriel down. The ending was alright but i didn't really enjoy it. The build-up through the movie was alright, kinda felt like a slow burn but not completely and the first half was very odd. Overall 7/10, wouldn't rewatch it but it was ok and I commend James Wan for wanting to give us something new even if it wasn't the best in my opinion.",Malignant

Multiple women start attacking the protagonist, no guards are around... Then the protagonist snaps and murders every women in the cell, attacks an officer, and then escapes like it is nothing. Okay, now it's the end of the movie, ""you'll always be my sister"", but what about all the people she just murdered?If this is all connected to what is essentially a parasitic twin, where do these supernatural abilities come from?

As for the main protagonist, she did a poor job and I did see a few failed expressions at certain cuts. It's like very noticeable.

638,gotjee_arts,"Plodding, Hokey Slop",1,14 September 2021,"Lest anyone be swayed by the almost Joker-like fervor with which most critics, armchair and professional alike, are telling you to ""just enjoy"" this pap because it's supposedly not trying to be anything but gory fun, I'd like to point out that even for the most stupidly enjoyable horror flicks a modicum of decent pacing, dialogue and plot are still vital. And this movie is strung together with everything but these things.There is no tension because you see the Big Twist coming within the first fifteen minutes, and every plot point revelation is undercut by a smash zoom on the main character while The Pixies' Where Is My Mind comes blaring out of absolutely nowhere and with no prior setup. It's so incongruous and cringeworthy that I laughed out loud every time it happened.The tone is also all over the place. For example I was waiting for the camera to zoom out of that asylum prologue to show that it was some incredibly wink-nudge parody playing on a tv screen in the background because I could not believe it was being played straight. And then throughout its runtime the movie careens from one half-hearted genre schtick to the next, never really settling on sanything engaging. Special shoutout to the women's jail scene which was also particularly broad and cartoonish, like insultingly so. Why was the black woman in full blacksploitation geish in a current-day setting? We'll never know.So without tone or tension, the movie must at least pack some horror thrills? Nope. Beyond a few jumpscares, the shadowy gestalten that Wan is addicted to, and some rubbery body horror straight from the eighties, the shlocky tittilation is but a thin unassuming veneer over the wrung out carcass of the movie's one interesting gimmick.Circling back to it, the setting, atmosphere and cinematography were so incredibly dreary and non-descript that I was only reassured this wasn't early aughts Saw by way of Lifetime when the splashy mind transitions tried to inject some life into the proceedings. Beyond that here was exactly one neat camera trajectory which was made all the more redundant by its singular appearance and inutility to the plot.Also frustrating is how the antagonist seems to operate in a vacuum, relocating victims completely unnoticed over long distances, loudly and messily disposing of them with zero notice from passers-by, neighbors, family or colleagues, or any cameras. Time and age discrepancies abound, characters are just plot conveniences to be ragdolled around like so many meaty blood sacks, nothing feels really earned. This whole movie actually felt like a tax writeoff that Wan planned around that one cool idea that he never managed to workshop beyond a hasty desk scribble.The one redeeming value is said cool idea, which only gets some satisfying bombast by the time the puppet strings get cut in the last half hour, logistically interestingly executed for the couple of minutes that we see it in devastating action. But the road to get there is such a tropey, by-the-numbers trudge that you'll likely have checked out long before that.",Malignant

He uses in the film which took me off guard you usually only see shots like that in a Wes Anderson type of film the ending twist I found to be predictable but the way the revel is directed is absolutely superb along with the practical effects if you have a soft spot for the campy classics be sure not to miss this one.",Malignant

The film's antagonist is one of the most interesting ones I've seen in a long time, one I won't forget anytime soon.Dont expect jump scares or any hiding behind your blanket, it's NOT that kind of horror film.

pros: is suspense , horror scenes, plot, the way the show the movie,
cons: gross I mean about gross that the half last is a lot of blood like the movie turn into saw movie or something more disgusting and that we didn't saw in James horror movies in last 10 years, the End wasn't enough cool, it showed you like you are watching a Disney movie that the Hero has won and the Evil man is loose

664,psychofox-88511,Damn good fun!,8,10 September 2021,"First and foremost, as a few reviews have already mentioned, this film really does play out like a classic 80s horror, though that's not apparent right away. For the first half, I really couldn't decide whether it was good or not. There were clichés, stupid decisions by characters, lines of dialogue which were cheesy as hell.But by the second half, all of that fell into place. As soon as I stopped trying to mentally rate and review the film as it went along and just enjoyed it instead, it really started to shine.There are so many callbacks to horror movies of the 80s and 90s, but in a very contemporary way. It seems to be fashionable now to make movies that look like they were filmed in a past decade; this one takes the narrative and cinematographic style but presents every thing through a modern lens.The script is compelling and engrossing, the acting is everything it needs to be, and the cinematography is great.It would be easy to level a lot of criticisms at this movie, but most would mean you have missed the point. The only criticisms I have are that the big reveal was signposted too obviously (it was imaginitive and original, but I still managed to predict EXACTLY what was going on by just past the half-way mark based on the overly generous clues handed to the audience), and that the score sometimes felt wholly inappropriate for the scene it accompanied.Overall, if you're willing to just sit back and enjoy it without trying to pick it apart, this is a great, entertaining horror movie, in a style which is rarely seen today.",Malignant
665,godgirlprincess,James Wan meets M. Night Shyamalan?,7,11 September 2021,"Not your typical horror. It was entertaining. The story was unique. It reminded me a lot of what M. Night Shyamalan did in Split, though I think he did it better than Wan. The questions as to how a person could do certain seemingly superhuman or even supernatural things are given a good basis in the film Split. That context is missing in this film but maybe Wan assumes most of his audience has seen Split? The music threw me off a bit. I liked it but it did give the film an off feeling. Maybe intentional. The house decor, vehicles and wardrobe choices gave it a retro feel. Overall, I was entertained. I laughed at several scenes, some maybe not intentionally funny, and wasn't really scared. It was a good concept piece and makes you think so for that I give it a 7 out of 10.",Malignant

Then you add a Kung Fu slasher scene where the kills are almost Jason Vorheesesque. The reveal of the what is the actual killer, is wasted, and would have been better in another actual horror movie with out all the extra that was thrown in. There are a few cool kills and has some entertaining scenes.",Malignant

But the horror elements there's some great moments, especially with its homage to Giallo with what's going around, down to the coat and gloves this thing wears. What's annoying though is that it sort of loses steam at one point. Completely slows down and almost feels parody with something it does. It then pulls the carpet out from under us and gives a ridiculous over the top finale that is incredibly gory and made me understand exactly why it's an 18. But this also had me wondering why couldn't the rest of the film have been this fun?! There is a reveal that completely surprised me though and I didn't see coming.James Wan is a director I've always really enjoyed, I feel this is his weakest though and it's a mash together of three of his films, Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring. Saw because of the music it does at points (One song that keeps playing throughout even sounds like a remix of the Saw theme) , the detective side of the story and some of the places it chooses to film in along with the cinematography. Insidious because it does the whole shot of house with fog around it and has a scene where someone is put in a trance to go to another place. And The Conjuring for its haunted house element.It does feel like quite a lot of the film is random scenes meshed together, but I can't deny that I did have fun with the finale and it sort of made the wait for it worth it!

The idea itself is a bit different than in similar horror movies of this type, I would describe it as delightfully B-class. But these are all the positives.The plot is generally silly, rather absurd and, unfortunately, predictable. Acting? Weak, and in the case of Mrs. Wallis very theatrical, which does not fit this type of film.The closer to the end, the more absurd it got, and by the end of the movie I couldn't help laughing anymore. All in all, I haven't laughed so much in the cinema for a long time.

Good lord, people are such drama queens these days.James Wan's latest film is a fun and gory love letter to the Italian horror movies of the 1980's. With that, much like the Italian horror movies of the 80's, it is style over substance. It embraces it's outlandish premise, and totally revels in it's campiness, and delivers a stylish, over-the-top, gory romp with a totally bonkers 3rd act. If you don't enjoy movies with a high camp factor, look elsewhere. As for me, I had a damn good time at this thing.",Malignant

All I can say without giving much away, is this movie was far from what I expected. At first the movie was a little difficult to get into and in all honesty, a bit confusing. It was within the last half of the movie that the story finally came together and boy, it was nothing what any person would expect. What I loved about the film was how both creative and imaginative it was. Hat's off to James Wan for his creativity. Yet again, another blockbuster of his that does not disappoint!",Malignant

This is the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in years! The acting is worse than a soap opera. Especially the sister. Omg is she Unbearable to watch. The discount shelf version of Wanda Sykes is also incredibly cringe worthy. It's like James wan went out of his way to cast the worst actors on the planet. The cgi gore is garbage, like most new age horror. The twist is somewhat interesting, but this movie is so bad it doesn't work. I feel like this was written by a high schooler with an 8th grade education. DONT BELIEVE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS.

This was fun. No it's not some piece of grand-meaning cinema, but it is a creepy cool rollercoaster with a nice antagonist who well deserves to be included in the iconic echelon of horror monsters.Cool concept, although basically episode 10 from season 7 of Tales from the Crypt. It expounded upon that premise and took the notion to greater heights that kept the story enjoyable.The cast wasn't great, but they weren't bad either. Don't watch horror for great acting. That's like going to a steakhouse for a great salad.Some of the scenes dragged on a hair long. Less is more and all that. But some shots were invigorating, one was even captivating.And you have to laugh at some of the moments. I think those laughs say something about the person you are, or the people with whom you're watching, the the intent or timing of the movie itself. The humor is found in the tragic. It's a horror movie. It's ok.All in all I would recommend this! Great job.",Malignant
695,VBeretta,Sam Raimi meets Dario Argento,8,18 September 2021,"Remember when horror movies were stylish, fun and bonkers? James Wan for sure does. This is, essentially, a love letter to classic Sam Raimi with Italian ""Giallo"" elements sprinkled on the top for further nostalgia (the cinematography literally changes on and off to ""Suspiria"" according to what it is happening on screen, I'm not joking; the props themselves seem to have been robbed from some Italian movie warehouse).This is a movie that *appears* to start blandly, with a lot of ""already seen"" scenes and plot points. Then the twists start to arrive at machinegun speed, and the beauty of it is how they always make sense (in their horrific way). Once the Big One hits this becomes a wall-to-wall splatter movie, but of the kind of splatter so bonkers that you can't help but laugh hard. Of all things, the third act of ""Malignant"" reminded me of a lost episode of ""Rick and Morty"".Talking about homages, horror aficionados will see winks to many other movies and genres. Blink and you will miss a Police Station where the dialogues are out of ""Hot Fuzz"". ""Why I'm calling the police?"" is, possibly, the funniest line in the movie (and why the station resembles a dancing club anyway?) John Carpenter, Stuart Gordon and, unavoidably, Wes Craven all make an appearance. Catching all these homages is half of the fun.If I have to point out a weak element, it would be the acting. Not because the actors are bad but because the characters are uniformly two-dimensional. They themselves are homages to horror cliches, not to real, fleshed out people. A giant kudos, however, goes to the stunt people.You will notice that I haven't touched the plot. Try to enter it with a blank mind. ""Malignant"" is one of the most fun, mindfu**ed and rewatchable movies of the last five years. If you love horror, it was made for you.",Malignant
696,jennaelectric,Enjoyable and Different!,8,10 September 2021,I really really enjoyed this film. It was uniquely weird and disturbing. Feels like a combination of Chronenberg meets Carpenter. My only real complaints are that towards the end it looked and felt like a video game to me. Some CGI felt weird since I love practical fx. Although trying to pull this off practically only would be a real challenge. Overall I though James Wan did an excellent job of bringing us something new. It like he took a lot of disturbing creepy things and mixed them in a bowl and created a fantastic horror dessert.,Malignant

698,kikogod,WTF did I just watched!? :D,6,12 September 2021,"Wow, rarely I have been so stunned, shocked and devided from a movie in my life. While I was ready to turn it off at least 2 times during the first half, after the middle, the movie turned a 180 and went full bonkers body horror, 80's slasher galore with a glorious finale.No, seriously, the first hour was so cheap, not interesting, boring, standart tropey and whatever other similar words you wanna use to describe it, that I was ready to turn it off and be really mad at James Wan. But then.. oh my God, it cranked everything up to 11. The story, the twists, the effects - everything.BUT, while the second half did turn my opinion around, I really think this is one of the worst Wan movies. At times it really felt super cheap and not even the cool camera movements, transitions and montage could hide it. Also it has some really boring and overused horror tropes that we've seen 10000 times already. Yes, there are a couple of original shots, and jump scares here and there, but overall, the movie has nothing to surprise you with. Music was also mediocre. Fun and slasher influenced at times but some compositions were repeating over and over during the movie that it became tedious. I can compare it to the annoying Amazons theme that started every time some amazons were showing up in the JL Snyder Cut.But anyway, while not the best Wan movie, the cheap looks, very dull first half and some other too standart horror tropes, the movie definitely changed my opinion in the last half. Really cought me off guard with how crazy and out there bonkers it became. Reminded me of the good days of Cronenberg body horror and 80's slashers. So it's a 6.5/10 from me!",Malignant

701,atch1983,Is this for real?,2,18 October 2021,"I have 2 theories.James Wan was pushed to this movie with all the bad actors and intentionally made it the worst peoject ever.

Then the scene with the husband and all, it was like ""ahh, nice, now thats the James Wan I like"". But after that, it was like, where the hell did these actors came from? And the screenplay, omg. Was it all for real? 🤷‍♂️Anyways, I choose to believe that James Wan did not believe in this project and intentionally made it suck so they dont force him another project again. But, what do I know.

So our bones won't break if we jump out of a building if someone else wills it?The main players act so stupidly in the end I didn't care whether they died or not. Who goes chasing a monster and not think to call for back up? Don't they have some bigger guns at a police station?

I watch this on HBO Max and as such I enjoy it for what it was, entertainment. That's it! I would not have paid a penny to watch this in the theaters. Would have waited for RedBox or for one of the streamers I'm subscribed to to show it.

It's boring as hell and lazily written. I guessed the entire plot within the first 10 minutes, and I could see every scare coming from a mile away. Plus in that first 10 minutes, they front loaded the film with SO MUCH DRAMA. It was almost comical, to the point where it felt like I was watching a Lifetime movie. The shots used in the film were SO cheesy, they kept doing this thing where a plot point would be revealed and they'd zoom in on a character's face with the classic violin horror screech. They literally did the same shot like 5 times. It was ridiculous. It genuinely seemed like this was a movie making fun of itself and other horror movies, while also coming off as a poorly written high school drama play. Plus, bad acting all around. It was like a spoof film. Not at all what I would expect from James Wan.1 out of 10, don't waste your money on this movie. Don't even stream it on HBOMax. It isn't worth your time.",Malignant

733,alexdmcintosh,Copy of a copy,5,15 September 2021,"One of the fun things about scrolling past the anime block on Netflix is seeing all the crazy names of the shows and movies. ""I want to eat your pancreas"", ""Made in Abyss"", ""That time I got reincarnated as a slime"", these are all phrases no native English speaker would ever hope to come up with. The same is true with a modern filmmaker trying to copy an 80s Italian slasher.Intention and craft are there, but they're too much. Wan shoots and blocks too smoothly and exactly the same way he shoots action scenes like in Aquaman - digital gloss, wide angle lens, 360 omnipresent camera, low frame rate energy. The problem in a horror movie is its all too clean and dictated by the camera instead of the action unfolding. In the hands of someone with more energy and invention like Sam Raimi, these become unnerving, jerky and crude, the unrefined nature adding to the atmosphere that Wan is clearly trying to capture. Here it all just feels calculated and winking.Defenders are calling it intentionally campy. This is all in their own reading of it. The problem is that 80s low budget slashers and giallos weren't trying to be campy. Those were trying to be copies of superior, more success and classier horror films from their unique cultural points of view, so Malignant ends up a facsimile of a facsimile, lost in its own irony and at odds with its tone. There are 'eyebrows' missing here that a non-native filmmaker could never hope to replicate.

Bad acting, bad script, stupid stupid characters, so many plot holes and just weird things that make no sense. It was not horror at all more like sci fi mixed with drama and a lifetime movie?? I get he was trying to go for something fresh than the same old horror movie but it just didn't hit it for me.

And I must admit I was enthralled by James Wan's visual talent and the ridiculous narrative combination. Don't go in expecting any serious story telling, watch it if you want to burst out laughing from a on the surface, serious looking horror flick. The beginning feels like The Room where you're left wondering if that scene was being over the top or not, and a little bit slow in the middle, but if you want more action in your horror, trust me, things get really better as it nears the end.",Malignant

Totally original and yet at the same time inspired by the grindhouse horror films of the 80's (and one in particular, but you won't get me to ever reveal which one!), Wan has delivered one of the most entertaining movies of the year.

741,Ibsen3,Some nice ideas terribly implemented (no spoilers),2,6 November 2021,"So the idea and the 'twist' are indeed a little different but did my fellow reviewers not consider the other (very important) aspects of the film? This seems to be the justification for some bizarrely inflated ratings during a Halloween period where the new horror offerings were very slim pickings.As a horror fan of some 40 or so years, it never fails to astonish me how quality is assessed in horror. For example, just because found footage is cheap to make and some people can't suspend their disbelief over who is holding the camera, the ratings for these movies tend to be astoundingly low even when some of these movies really push boundaries and have a lot to offer in other respects...and here lies my confusion.Why has this been so highly rated? A movie in which the required suspension of disbelief is so high that my wife and I had to keep repeating ""just go with it"" as a mantra every few moments in order to get to the end and offer a fair review. Seriously, we're used to doing this but not through gritted teeth!A good test of whether you will like it or not is to give the introductory scene a go. If, like us, you immediately asked the question ""is this a spoof?"" then it probably isn't for you. We honestly thought it was beginning with a scene in which the main character was watching a really bad movie. At least then it might have justified the inflated ratings.It seems that there has been an attempt at 80s nostalgia which is all well and good. I was a kid in the 80s and enjoyed some of the horror movies at the time, but when the aforementioned nostalgia also involves 80s-quality acting (I mean, it's really bad) and some incredibly hammy, overwhelmingly cliched set pieces then we have to take a step back. I'm guessing that this odd 'nostalgia factor' has something to do with the idea that so many are seeing '80s schlock' as some kind of justification for it being a good film. It really isn't.What I found absurd was how it clearly commanded a decent budget despite appearing to self-consciously revel in its own cheesy melodrama. Some of the 'Silent Hill-like' effects were surprisingly good but out-of-keeping with the often mindless dialogue, over-exuberant direction and bloody awful acting. It actually reminded me of the 90s when some film-makers had just discovered some new effects and wanted to find an excuse to try them out.In the end, it comes across as some odd remastered version of a rather unique 80s horror. At least then your sense of nostalgia will carry you through.As it is, I was halfway between laughing and groaning through the entire elongated twist and the resulting chaos that breaks out.Sure, it's a little different but it's beyond ridiculous and very poorly executed.",Malignant

744,andrewtmallory,What do you want to be?,4,15 September 2021,"This movie had some classic James Wan scares mixed with filmmaking style that you've come to recognize. However, partway through it starts genre bending. Our villain is semi revealed and the beat drops completely changing the tone and mood of the movie. The soundtrack and writing wavers between Horror and a comic book action homage. It doesn't really settle one way or another or coexist comfortably. It becomes a tad jarring. One moment, you're trying to fear the ""monster"", the next, you're grooving to his next kill. The story itself is easy to grasp. What remains besides is confusing and disjointed. There were enjoyable enough parts but the foray into the genre bend makes an odd balance.After digesting it overnight, I still can't shake how this movie feels very M. Night Shyamalan in purpose. Coming out of another Aquaman, he seems enamored with the comic genre and like Shyamalan. This feels like he is doing his own love letter to the genre.

It's best to just ignore the people that share these hysterical opinions and decide for yourself if this looks like a movie that interests you.The movie, in my opinion, was sincerely bonkers. It started off as a paranormal-esque thriller with some real creepy moments and slowly transformed into a mystery, action, stylized gore-fest extravaganza with some light humor mixed in the middle. James Wan continues to show off his unique blend of cinematography and over the top visions on this one.For those saying the movie wasn't self aware of it's ""campy"" dialogue and murder scenes, come on, this is the same guy whose worked on the Conjuring, Saw, and Insidious franchises not to mention Fast & Furious 7... he 100% knows when he's being cliche and it was undoubtably intentional. Not liking it is one thing and perfectly okay, but to say this film is ""garbage"" or an ""embarrassment"" is absurd.This movie was great, not perfect, but not horrible either.

I am sure most people would agree, that the very beginning sequence of the film was unnecessary, but that is probably my only criticism. I watch a lot of films and I would say that this film along with 'don't breathe 2' are my favourite films so far this year (which didn't have over the top budget and big actors). It's not a classic by any means but I cannot imagine anybody being disappointed.

771,jreagan-42424,A derivative story made with excellence,8,23 September 2021,"Major spoilers ahead, read at your own discretion.Malignant starts out with an absolute bang. The first scene of this movie is intense, scary, and disturbing.However, once the (amazing) opening credits roll by, we are treated to more haunted house schlock, when a woman and her husband are attacked by what appears to be a ghost. This is not a ghost, however, as it turns out, it was the woman all along, controlled by a parasitic twin she had growing in her brain since birth, and was supposedly taken out by doctors. The evil twin has hijacked the woman's mind after a hit on the head 'awoke' him, and is out for revenge to kill the doctors who tried to separate them, the woman's adoptive family, and their own birth mother.At one point during the movie I told my wife: ""This is like that episode of the Simpson's Treehouse of Horror, where Bart had an evil twin!"", and she said I ruined the movie for her.But yes.This movie is a mixture of the Simpson's Treehouse of Horror Bart's Evil Twin episode, with that scene from Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone where the dude had a face in the back of his head. Throw in Belial from Basket Case, and you got Malignant.Despite its slight unoriginality the movie is amazing, due in large part to James Wan's expert direction, the movie's intense pacing, the superb acting, and the truly horrifying visuals James Wan and his team cooked up, and shot with beautiful photography.The evil twin's face is in the back of the woman's head, so when the twin commits the murders, he moves backwards, making for some spectacular visuals.The murders are violent, bloody and gory, and James Wan doesn't pull any punches. This movie has a lot of sickening and disturbing images of extreme violence.Structured like many of his own horror movies (think The Conjuring), the story may be derivative, but it is relatively solid.I did manage to find ONE PRETTY BIG PLOT HOLE during my first viewing. It is explained that while the twin commits the murders, the woman is put in an illusion where she believes she is living life normally, but she can have visions of what the twin does. In one scene she is seen sleeping in bed and having visions of the twin murdering a man in his own house, the movie tells us that these visions are connected, so she sees them as they happen simultaneously. But then she screams and her sister comes in to comfort her. In the next scene, the sister takes her to the police. If the twin (which is in the back of her head, mind you) was committing the murder with her own body, how could she scream in her own room, and how could her sister come in and find her there? Shouldn't she be in the apartment killing the man? A huge blow to continuity, and it's not even subtle if I noticed it during my very first viewing of the movie.But the movie works well despite that, and it managed to keep me intrigued during most of its runtime. (Except for the scene in the police precinct, but that's a story for another time).",Malignant

813,healingpampered,A Love Letter to Horror B Movies,8,12 September 2021,"I heard a lot of chatter about Malignant being some kind of neo-Giallo film, but I really think that was just an attempt to distract from the true nature of this film, to protect the twist in the third act. Sure there are elements of Giallo here but they are just nods. The true parentage of Malignant is over-the-top violent, frenetic paced and usually at least SEMI tongue-in-cheek horror B movies from the 70's and 80's. James Wan sets the viewer up for the ride in the opening sequence with an absolutely bonkers set piece that lets you know his intentions right off the bat. It's gonna be bloody, violent and poke fun at it's own parentage. I truly believe that this is done as a way to communicate to the viewer - ""Stay with us on this ride. It's going somewhere great. The 2nd act will drag a little but there is a good reason."" Once you see the reveal, you understand a lot of the more puzzling elements earlier on.Now, is this film an acting class? Nope. It is the most clever plot you'll ever see? Not even. Will you guess the twist early on? That depends on how many of these types of films you have seen before. I figured out what sub-genre this was early on but I didn't get the twist until about five seconds before it dropped in all it's glory. I only had time to get out ""NO WAY."" before my wife said ""What?"" and then we were both like - ""WT actual F?!?!""I just have to applaud James Wan for attempting something fresh and semi-original here. There is so much to like about this film. The cinematography, most of the special effects, the humor, the way it doesn't pull punches with the violence - and the fact that there is no gratuitous sexuality. This film is on a mission. If you relax, have fun with it and don't take it (or yourself) too seriously, this film is a blast and a joy to behold, for fans of bloody disgusting horror, anyway. If you don't like violence, DO NOT watch this film. There are no jump scares and no silly Deus-Ex-Machina resolutions. In the end it all makes glorious, ridiculous, bloody, violent sense.If you dig movies like My Bloody Valentine, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Basket Case, Dead Ringers, Sinister, etc... you will most likely be grinning like an idiot at the end of Malignant. Invite some friends over, order a pizza and have a blast with this one. It's definitely worth checking out.",Malignant

817,nathanielcmetz,People walked out of the theater because they were so disapointed,2,11 September 2021,"This film was very disappointing to me, and I think part of that is related to how it was advertised and how it was hyped up.Given that it was meant to be a love letter to Italian horror movies, I went in expecting something akin to the stylistically overwhelming cinematography of Dario Argento and the boldness of commitment to vision from Fulci. Technology has developed a lot since the 70s-80s, and I was hoping Wan to take the experimental nature of the Italian legacy and shoot it into the stratosphere. One scene did actually manage to capture that. The scene where the protagonist is running through her house, and we can peer through the ceiling to see her running through the different rooms was one of the most fascinating use of the God's eye view that I've ever seen. But that was only memorable shot in the film (in my opinion). Instead, I felt like this movie was more of a mashup between Aquaman and The Conjuring, with dialogue and acting capability lifted from a Hallmark movie.Perhaps if you go into the film looking for a campy romp full of tonal inconsistency, then you will have a good time. I imagine that this film will develop a cult following in times to come, which is fine. Cult films are fun, and hopefully I will have changed enough to appreciate that.Normally, I love campy films. And I feel like if this film were more committed to its camp quality and marketed/hyped as such, then I would have perhaps enjoyed it more. But I found the tone and mood of the film to be all over the place. At times, it was deadly serious, dealing with incredibly dark themes of miscarriage and spousal abuse. Other times, it was an over-the-top romp with cheesy choreography and ridiculous/repugnant creature design. Of course, sometimes camp and seriousness can be blended together well, and others might enjoy how it was executed in this film, but I did not think it worked. It felt like a school group project, where each student worked independently of the other, and then mashed it together for a final presentation right before class.The visuals were unimpressive except for a scene or two. If you've seen the Conjuring, you've seen this cinematography.The musical score was perhaps my least favorite aspect of the film. The music would often ruin scenes for me because it would not match the tone of what was happening in the scene. You'd have a brutal murder scene with the classic Wanian suspense, but then it would be abruptly followed by what sounds like a store-brand-version of ""Where is My Mind?"" by The Pixies. This would pull me out of the film in a way that did not come across as a deliberate artistic decision, and so watching the film would get frustrating because I couldn't hang onto the atmosphere, but it also did not feel as if it was deliberately disrupting the atmosphere in a way that enhanced the film or challenged artistic sensibilities in a well-crafted manner.I thought the ""twist"" at the end was completely unoriginal and totally predictable. I'm pretty sure the exact ""twist"" of the film is taken from a George A. Romero movie in the 90s (not going to say which one because I don't want to spoil it).There was A LOT of flashback in this movie in which the characters watched VHS tapes of their childhood and such. I thought they relied too much on that as a story-telling device, and this also eliminated the possibility of spectacular visual cinematography of which Wan is capable.The dialogue was also excruciating. Imagine that ""Rey...Rey Skywalker"" moment from ""The Rise of Skywalker"" but stretched out over an entire film. In many ways, actually, I think ""Malignant"" and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" are quite similar in their bizarre atonality and feeling like hodgepodge.When I saw it in the theater, several people walked out of the film because they thought it was so ridiculous. I've never before witness people get to a point where they were openly mocking the film and even sarcastically clapping at certain points.I do not think that this is an objectively well-crafted film, which was very disappointing me. I thought it had the potential to revolutionize horror cinematography, but it seems we'll have to wait for another day.However, I can imagine that if you go into this film looking for something ridiculous, then you might very well enjoy it, and that's great. Some other positive reviews on here have expressed that opinion, and I think it's a valid perspective. Since I like campy terrible films so much, I might come around to enjoying this movie later on, so hopefully time will change my all-too-high expectations.",Malignant

I actually spit out my drink laughing. Of course it was never brought up again and had absolutely nothing to do with anything at all. I will say I did get a good laugh out of it though. To think they spent 40 MILLION DOLLARS on this thing. Don't know how James Wan bombed this so terribly.

It's not bad, it's unmemorable to the extent I can't even consider it ""so bad it's good"" because it wasn't ""passable"" good or deliciously bad.The 1st half spent so much time trying to set up a serious tone only for it to be completely abandoned in the 2nd half for absurd scenes & dialogue.Also the ""clues"" about the plot development were obvious so I was able to point out what was going to happen in the storyline well before it did to my boyfriend. (I don't mind ""getting it"" two steps ahead but when I figure the mystery out 30 mins before something is revealed that's way too boring of a development)I'm not sure why a 70's blacksploitation woman was in the cell with...women who were dressed in modern day clothes? Like that didn't make any sense at all lol, was she abducted from the 70's? Does she do exploitation film re-enactments at the local community theatre? Seriously, why is she the only blast from the past in this cell?I'm not sure what that really long drawn out chase scene was for when the person being chased wasn't caught at the end of it or lead to anything important. So we could see the stunt double flip over obstacles, I guess?And the final big fight scene was just like....okay so the bad guy knows pro martial arts now? Lol, alright then.

The twist doesn't land given that the majority of theatregoers should be able to figure it out with little effort.James Wan is a fantastic filmmaker and has produced some great horror flicks.

869,valeriiegedeshevykh,80's Model Horror Action: Malignant,7,19 September 2021,"James Wan has been one of the most visionary names in cinema since the first day he entered our lives with his still masterpiece, Saw. In fact, in my personal opinion, he is the best director alive right now. There is no one who makes the directing profession as good and creative as Wan. The way he uses his camera is so impressive that I look forward to every movie he shoots. Even if he will direct a wedding, I will watch it. I am exactly on this line. Malignant was, of course, a movie I was looking forward to. And it was worth my wait. Wan has proven time and time again that his vision has not yet reached his limits. I will write the horror part of the movie in more detail soon, but let me tell you from the beginning that I will explain it at length: As long as he continues to make films, he will remain the number one in this business.Let's briefly touch on the subject... While Madison is waiting for compassion from her husband due to the pain she suffered from her pregnancy, she bangs her head against the wall with her husband's sudden outburst. In the evening of hitting her head, she begins to see things that she cannot fathom. These things first took her pregnancy; then kills people from her past that she couldn't remember. And that things make her witness for all the murders it did.First of all, it should be said that it is not possible to say fear for Malignant. Although it makes the beginning as horror movie, in time it evolves to completely action horror. Of course, as someone who wanted to watch horror movie, I was disappointed little bit, but James Wan makes up for everything with his directing approach. James Wan, who has managed to present a new and surprising angle, movement and approach in almost every movie he directed, shows us once again that his vision has not yet reached its limits after The Conjuring 2.His directing in The Conjuring 2 will likely remain the best of his career. But Malignant just as brilliant as English Amytiville. Many scenes in the movie are impressive enough to be enchanted. The bird's eye view of the house, the prison fight and the chaos of the police station gave me the goosebumps. We should also talk about the design created by the director for Gabriel. The scene where Gabriel runs straight down the hall and turns left, was one of the craziest things I've seen in a long time. James Wan has used the character's double-sided movement in the fights perfectly. The choreography of the fight in the prison and police station was impressive enough to raise the level of cinematography.Now there are some details that define James Wan cinema. High-end and show-stopping shots, fog creeping through the house and floor, female characters struggling with challenges. We can find these details on Malignant too. Although the topics change, Wan's female characters do not change and they fight against strange monsters on an on. This time, however, the situation is a little bit different. The female character has to struggle with the ""male"" living as a tumor in her body. Wan's movies doesn't have plot-twists, mostly. At the beginning of Malignant, we actually saw the thing behind the curtain and what we will encounter in the troughthout the movie, but i had hard time to understand where we will meet with that thing in the story. Couldn't connect the dots. For this reason, the film managed to preserve its mystery until the end. No matter how much the action is in the foreground, the movie is interesting in my opinion.To sum it up... Malignant is a movie that stands out more for its action than horror, even though it is marketed as a horror movie. While it doesn't have a high-level story, it sure does tell an engaging journey. The director is already ahead of the story with his shots. If you are interested in James Wan's cinema, you will most likely reach the peaks of pleasure while watching it. The director's design of Gabriel and the action he builds on that design are chillingly clever. Considering that Malignant he's one of the weakest films of his filmography, even his weakest is visionary.",Malignant

I would've rated higher if it wasn't for the complete predictability of it all. And I don't mean predictability from the storytelling. For me it was the visuals that gave it all away way too soon. The very first time you see the killer's movements I had figured it out. I know this is loosely based on James Wan's own graphic novel, Malignant Man, (of which I haven't read) but this version would definitely make a better horror novel.

2) Reviews I checked stated that it is not scary and not so good, yet it is a fun/thrilling movie.I have to say that eventhough I love this type of movies, this one is not thrilling nor fun. The lead is bland and unlikeable, the acting is bad and the first two acts are generic, predictable and mediocre.Then, the final act starts, and eventhough is fast paced and a bit creative, the non sense of the big reveal/plot twist didn't allow me to enjoy it!I give this a 3 because it kept me guessing who was responsible behind those murders and I didn't see it coming.

There are certain camera shots and sequences that only James Wan does, and I think in this movie those really shined. The premise of the whole story is pretty consistent and you never feel like you are being treated as if you were stupid, which happens in a lot of modern horror movies. Having come to this, I will say that this movie is more similar to classic horror movies rather than modern ones. I don't want to spoil anything, you will just have to see it for yourself. The only negative thing I have to say about the film is that it did not really scare me. Still, I liked it.IMPORTANT! Don't watch it thinking that it would be another Conjuring movie, it has nothing to do with the other movies that James Wan has directed and produced. This story is more sophisticated and it is more focused towards what I would call ""monster horror"" than just the usual supernatural horror of a bewitched house in which some murders occured a 100 years ago.GO WATCH IT WITH AN OPEN MIND AND NO EXPECTATIONS AND ENJOY!!!!!!!",Malignant

I'm pretty good at predicting twists, and this movie is pretty predictable. I assumed some evil twin was involved, I even joked with my husband that it would be funny, but cool, if the evil twin was at the back of her head like Lord Voldemort...which basically happened.I was actually happy that this wasn't an evil spirit/demon/ghost type of movie for once...yes, gabriel was evil, but he was ""human"" in a way.

But for the life of me...I just couldn't put a finger on why I didn't. But for me, I didn't have to mull over it for very long.The story itself is actually quite a clever one, it was told with relative efficiency and that was good to see after the tragedy that is Halloween Kills, which I saw back to back with this film.It was a nice, gory, splattery and thoroughly nasty little romp. However it is very much flawed. My first and biggest problem with this film is the pacing, which to my knowledge is a key factor in making a horror film. The opening of this film was completely unnecessary, it was essentially really bad writing mixed with exposition. Coming right off that and we are jolted into the film, and within a space of a minute we are introduced to our protagonist, and a defining inciting incident. From this point onwards, I will refrain from describing the events that follow. But what I will say, is that to follow the opening of this film with the kind of domestic turbulence on display in the first minutes of knowing the key character initially made the protagonist feel out of place, it simply didn't work.Then comes the indecision of what kind of film it wanted to be. It was a Wan film, no question about it. All the typical haunted house esthetics where there. However, it seems he was taking inspiration from early 80s Italian Giallo cinema. But no, It wasn't just Giallo, it was the type of 90s B-movie antics we are all familiar with if you saw anything from that era. In fact there is an entire scene, and it's probably the best scene in the movie, that felt lifted from Jeepers Creepers, but sported a new horror movie villan. In short, it wound up feeling as if it hadn't been allowed to be one or the other.To surmise, it wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It just exist now.",Malignant

There's so much that's awful about this film, it's difficult to know where to start. It spoils nothing to say that the plot is revealed in the first five minutes of the movie. A lot of reviewers have said there's a shocking twist at the end, but you would have to be braindead to not realize that what you expect is going to happen is exactly what happens. After the first 5 mins., I paused the movie because I couldn't believe that what I was watching was the same movie that was getting stellar reviews. Maybe I had selected the wrong title, or there was a glitch with my tv? Nope. After I confirmed this in fact was ""Malignant"", I thought maybe James Wan was spoofing the evil conjoined twin trope, and that the meat and potatoes of the film would come shortly. Again, I was sorely disappointed. This movie is entirely serious in its view of itself. At no time does the movie lean in to campiness. Part of what makes something campy is that it's in on the joke; it winks at the audience and acknowledges its lack of seriousness. But not this film. The acting, writing, and special effects were all played as though it was 100% prime movie making. It doesn't even fall into the ""So Bad It's Good"" category because it doesn't offer an ounce of levity, enjoyment, or just plain slashing fun.

Also, she reveals one hell of a secret to her sister who she's allegedly very close with - a secret a sister would have divulged to her close sister ages ago. It makes no sense.

It has originality and suspense. Some scenes are great: the carnage that happens in the female jail is filmed with a great maestry.The result: it keeps you waiting the misterious end and Wan delivers it with dignity.If David Cronenberg would have in his hands this idea the movie could have been a masterpiece. A total 10.Do not hesitate: if you enjoy terror films, with a little gore in it, watch this movie, it will not bore you.",Malignant

904,andy-blunt,20 minutes of very enjoyable cinema!,7,2 October 2021,"What on earth to make of this?A film which for about 80% of it's runtime was pretty poor, and made me roll my eyes, ""tut"" out loud, and squirm in my cinema seat; yearning for the exit?A film which features cringeworthy dialogue that no human would ever say in real life. E.g. A man telling his partner ""How many times do I have to watch my children die inside of you?"" (!!!)A film which contains awkward and painful exposition, with characters over-explaining the plot; again in a way that real people just don't do.A film which has numerous moments of hammy acting.And also a baffling lack of continuity.Let me give some examples of that last point;In one scene we see a car driving towards an imposing clifftop building, with the scenery bathed in sunlight.Yet the car then pulls up outside that same building in the pitch black dead of night!(Did I miss something?!?)In another scene, a powerful supernatural entity for some reason runs in fear from a single policeman......only to later on take out a whole platoon of them; single-handed.(Sorry, but is this thing invincible or not?)Finally, an old man in his bedroom notices an open window, and a long trail of blood on his floor.So he clears everything up, and then just goes to bed.(You know, because it's just a mysterious river of blood, right?!?)(Probably not worth investigating or anything!)Anyway, and so it was, that about 80% through what seemed to be another somewhat overrated James Wan film, I found myself squirming restlessly, and muttering out in anguish...""Just make it end!!!""And then came the twist...(which I will not spoil.)And it was magnificent!!!All of a sudden, I am murmuring ""whoa!""
Then chuckling out loud...
Then sitting up straight in my seat......and watching, transfixed, as the movie completely transformed;
from a standard supernatural-being movie with jump-scares,
into a full on, basket-case-crazy, 1980s style splatterfest!Let me be clear on this. Against all expectations, and out of the blue, I found the last 20 minutes or so of this movie to be giddily exciting!By embracing full-on hardcore horror, in a way that most modern movies fear to do, the director had somehow turned this thing completely around.And I also had to salute the lead actress Annabelle Wallis, for being game enough to tag along for the ride.This is why I go to the cinema, for sequences like that last 20 minutes.Indeed, I couldn't stop thinking about the film afterwards, and asking myself, have I ever seen a film transform itself so utterly like that before?I concluded that the nearest thing I could compare it to would be ""The Cabin in the Woods"". Which I also wasn't especially into for most of it's runtime, but which had also turned things around, with a bonkers finale.So in the end, and against all the odds, I'm actually glad I went to see Malignant!Oh, and I get it now...

909,pvelasquez17,The only horror here is the acting.,2,1 November 2021,"Gave it two stars because it made us laugh because of how terrible it was.It's literally the worst film I've ever seen. The dialogue was terrible throughout the film and the second half of the film was literally laughable.All I could think the entire time was how much I underestimated what Leigh Wannell contributed to their partnership.This feels like a A James Wan movie where he had full, complete control and desperately, desperately needed someone to reel him in.Also, why was the acting so incredibly bad? I truly thought for the first 30 minutes, he was going for a b movie vibe, til I realized he was serious. Hell, we even double checked if we were watching the right movie because of how terrible the acting was.After a while it just became a mock fest for us, throughout the movie we were laughing out loud at how terrible it was, so many bad jokes, all of the cringy cliches and bad horror film tropes, the over over the top unnecessary action scenes and the psycho-like sound effects on every other scene... This is some Scary Movie-level parody...

Its not bad by any stretch, it was just basically bits from his previous horror films (Insidious, Conjuring, Dead Silence), blended into one.THEN...2/3 of the way through it totally goes bonkers and becomes a ultra violent action horror that jumps from one exciting setpiece to the next.Overall it doesn't all work, but James Wan throws so much at the screen it's hard for some it it not to land. It is efficiently made, the sets are well put together, there's a good bit of bloody violence and gore, however the acting (except from the lead, she's good) is quite bad, and the script is terrible.

For me personally, I had no idea what this film was about going into it and I had a great time.Firstly, it started off with a bang in the hospital and slowed down for a while but then about half way it had a twist that instantly made everyone in the cinema go mad. From that point on I was completely fixed to the screen. Everyone is saying it was 'CAMP' which it was and it done this intentionally.

It leans into its absurdity and doesn't even look back. Not one bit.Oh and the scene in the jail cell is probably one of the best scenes put to any horror movie. Just so campy and ridiculously funny.",Malignant
919,Maddie_Zadvinskis,Malignant: Insane But Could Be A Work of Genius,7,3 October 2021,"Malignant is quite the concept. This is the latest work from James Wan, who is best known for Saw, Insidious, and establishing the Conjuring Cinematic Universe. James Wan has also taken on directing big blockbusters such as Furious 7 and Aquaman. He has both written and directed this film. All I gotta say is that it is an absolutely insane yet awesome experience.Malignant focuses on a woman named Madison or Maddy. She had recently suffered from a traumatic experience which resulted in her miscarriage. She was pushed into the wall (brutally) by her abusive husband. Her head begins to bleed terribly. Later that night, a mysterious intruder comes into their house, murders her husband and pushes her around. After being discharged from the hospital and reconnecting with her sister, Maddy begins to see visions of people who she doesn't know get brutally murdered by this dark figure. Each time she has these visions, her head bleeds. She soon discovers that she is actually witnessing these murders take place in real time, when she is having these visions. She teams up with the local detectives who helped her with her case, to find out who this killer is and how Maddy is connected to these murders.Malignants' tone is all over the place and is filled with numerous plot holes. Upon my first viewing, I thought that the tone was trying to be serious and tragic and was trying to relay the theme of trauma in some way, while dealing with some paranormal-like killer. I had gone in blind before watching this movie. I didn't really know what the general plot of the movie was. I was expecting something like Insidious when watching this. Madison's house looks so much like the first house in Insidious. In fact, each act of this film has different tones and pretty much changes genres throughout. The first act seems to follow James Wan's typical paranormal horror formula, then the second act seems to diverge more into the mystery/suspense thriller type of movie like Se7en, and then the third act is absolutely insane and well worth watching the movie. It's a twist that will just leave you either baffled, in awe, or else on the ground crying laughing. Basically it's like Insidious meets The Crow meets Shutter Island meets Orphan meets Stranger Things meets Evil Dead meet The Matrix. I was not the least bit bored when watching this movie. This is very much a film that does take some time to process with all of the insanity involved. I couldn't decide if James Wan was trying to have Malignant be something like his previous works or if he actually was trying to make it a ridiculously campy horror film like Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series. I'm thinking Malignant is more of the latter.With all of the inconsistent tones, plot holes, lots of things being left unexplained, less than stellar acting, very basic and uninteresting dialogue, and bizarre story directions, it really works and I am trying to figure out whether or not this is a work of genius. Upon second viewing, I begin to notice some minor details that are used as a type of foreshadowing for the big twist and the overall themes of family doesn't have to be blood-related and trauma are strangely delivered but again, it also works really well. There is also genuine effort put into this movie, especially with the cinematography and the stunts. It is very well done. Though there are still many plot holes and things left unexplained. And in typical James Wan fashion, the ending does leave room for a sequel.I know this movie has gotten a lot of mixed reception. I'm sure most people who were expecting something like Insidious or the Conjuring, thought it was stupid. I think the modern horror audience has forgotten or is not aware of the idea of camp. Camp can be a hard thing to pull off in movies, especially nowadays. I partially think the reason why we don't see these types of movies anymore is because of how our culture has been taking everything so seriously and is so quick to get offended. Notice how there are not very many comedies being made anymore or how mainstream movies seem to be reusing storylines and only making remakes of other works from the past? It is because the studios are afraid of offending audiences and taking risks. It is truly a shame because some of the best movies ever made are the ones that do take risks. I am glad that James Wan did make something so bizarre and insane and took a big risk in doing so. He has gained a lot of respect from me as a horror movie fan. I believe that it did pay off. I could totally see this movie becoming a cult classic in the future. I would love to see behind the scenes footage and interviews to get a better understanding of what the true intentions of this movie were.If you love movies like Evil Dead, you will for sure like this movie. I would also recommend this movie to watch during the Halloween season with lots of friends and alcohol. I would also recommend this film if you are absolutely sick and tired of the same old tropes being used in horror movies and are craving for something different. Trust me, the entire third act is totally worth the watch.",Malignant

I mean so bad it prevents you from being scared and may even make you giggle. But is it bad casting or just a clever director who is winking at you? We will probably never know but the novelty of the ""twist"" alone makes it worth watching. Those scenes could have easily been hilarious but, instead, provided solid action that kept me entertained.

934,mikecoopey,Self-indulgent bilge,3,12 September 2021,"I completely get the 80s/giallo/video-nasty homage stuff, but, a cheeky, knowing nod to crap 80s films doesn't automatically raise this garbage above being crap also. Were we supposed to enjoy the over-the-top wide lens camera work, or just enjoy 'getting it'? The same for the dodgy effects, dialogue and acting? Do the 'risky' shock moments and 'ballsy' narrative make a good film? And has anyone actually confirmed with Wan that any of this was a tongue-in-cheek homage to the straight-to-video horror era? Or is it just a wildly self-indulgent director given too much money and no restraint? Yes, yes... ballsy, risky, creative, original, shocking, whatever. It's like saying ""it KNOWS it's crap, therefore it's good (... or you just don't get it)"". I guess I just don't get it.It's definitely a film of two halves, with the long, bumpy set-up struggling to hold any audience attention amid the indulgent camera work, in-your-face effects and horror tropes, and the appalling acting; and then the bonkers finale which scores points for lunacy and a sudden injection of entertainment, but still manages to induce more ridiculed laughter than laugh-along thrills.For me, it was just 'awful' throughout, no matter how knowingly awful it's supposed to be. This wasn't so much a great artist mocking bad art, than a bad artist assuming he's a master. Perhaps this film is so busy nodding at the 80s and indulging the director that it forgot to nod at actually being any good for the audience. Saying that, there is definitely an audience for this sort of laugh-out-loud garbage who'll indulge in a good wtf chat over a beer. Who's to say that doesn't make for a good time?

The music did not seem to fit the film at all and the effects were not for me, but 2 out of 10 for some good shots on film, particularly when playing with lighting, but we have got to stop trying to make films around one or two good looking scenes. It has to be a good story to tell. My heart rate didn't speed up one time during this film, and i definitely would not consider this a horror movie. Donnie Darko is scarier than this film if that tells you anything haha. Sorry James, i wanted to like it, but what the heck was that?",Malignant

The acting was so bad it sometimes made one cringe or laugh , The movie is full of all these weird cuts and whats up with the music the movie is like a Fight Club copy-cat but the most annoying part was the weirdly illogical convenient full of confidences story that make you wonder what is this movie identity ?

It actually has more style than this period, a very distinctive Wan style of course, but the premise is very much of a certain time in horror. Maybe 2021 isn't the time for it to some, but I happen to be someone who still enjoys delightfully nonsensical gory films that are unapologetic.It's fairly creepy and serious in the first half and feels very Insidious, but the second half is insanity and it's glorious.

I have watched plenty of horror movies: The thing, alien, aliens, the blob, creepshow, martyrs, saw, conjuring, midsommer etc. And plenty of other include some popular B rated films as well.This movie really keeps you interested all the way through. It has a very unique villain and a very twisted plot. It is what I classify as sort of a B movie related acting in the first 5-10 minutes. Then, the movie officially starts and I have to admit, the actors really are good. The scenery, the eerieness of the plot, questions the viewer on how or why the occurances occur.The movie entails a 5-10 minutes of B rated acting and horror, into a 1 hour and 30 minute slow burn as in a creep up to the final 30 minutes of odd, but unique horror scenery. The story starts to make sense after you watched the first 10 minutes of the film, then the viewer understands the remaining 1 hour and 45 minutes of the film.The gore and blood is gruesome and the ending is really where the action and excitement start to reel in. It is really creepy, especially the transformation scene that reminded my of kuato and totall recall. You will understand this reminiscence after watching the film. I highly recommend it as it is one of my favorite horror movies I have ever seen up until today and I seen thousands of horror films. Im a gore fanatic.The downsides are a few silly moments and moments where you think to yourself, why couldn't they have done this better? The ending sets up for a sequel, but I just don't understand why it had to end in a stupid way. Alot of people die in the movie and for what reason?",Malignant

I love weird movies, scary movies, satirical movies, but I can't peg what category this one is supposed to fall into.

With his new movie he has proven it again.The movie has a really good setting and starts at once with the action. No time for long plot building needed. The horror moves on very well and the first scenes with the killer, his movements are intense and brilliant. Also the technique used to show the switch of locations is really wonderful. The story leaves its ending open for a long time You can only imagine how the story will move on. But well, then came the moment when the killer showed his real face. And that ruined kinda everything. From that point on the stroy was absurd. But because the movie was reall good most of the time it keeps its six stars.There are also some other annoying things:
That forensic girl being in love with the officer is just unnecessary and annoying.The music in some scenes does absolutely not fit.The chemistry between both officers is not well played.",Malignant

Yes, it was better than most of the horror movies produced today, but still, I was expecting more. I would definitely say that Conjuring 3 (Devil Made Me Do It) was a better movie, although we all know that it wasn't directed by Wan.

horror way. I liked the way the director captured that vibe. Most scenes looked like something out of 80's music video and the slight flirtations between two of the characters was funny and cute, which was definitely a feature of films from that error. The concept itself was great, reminiscent of lots of the body horror greats of the past. I also liked the idea that current Seattle is build on top of an old abandoned perfectly preserved Seattle. If this is true (??) I definitely want to go there.One thing I would say is as much as I value others opinions I think its a very worrying trend when people come out and say others are bots or payed just because they don't agree with them.

But in the middle, it's somehow predictable. It felt like the movie isn't trying to hide anything, not trying to have a plot twist in the end. Everything seems flat. And, due to the nature of the story where it sounds so bizzarre, trying to combine science and supernatural horror in a way that is a bit off, the visual effect became so unrealistic, and, sometimes feels old-school.I guess the high expectation set before watching the movie, along with some awesome reviews, makes it easier to be disappointed.",Malignant

I think he was trying to go somewhere different with this movie but the movie couldn't decide exactly what it wanted to be. In the end I thought it came out as plain silly.

Please watch the whole movie, as the first half makes complete sense after you understand the entire plot as it is laid out for you in the second half.I can't say enough good things about this, and mostly for the fact at how intentional everything in the movie is...the first scene in the entire movie seems like it's not even apart of the plot with how goofy and campy it is, but then you realize it's actually apart of the plot and this is how the movie is (great way of setting the tone for the rest of the movie).This is not a serious movie, you are not supposed to actually be scared, just half a good time and watch the ridiculousness ensue...",Malignant

However, the movie took a sharp turn! The main character's slow realization that she not only knew the killer but was actually attached to it, brought the thrill that I was looking for! Most horror movies give the viewer a break period, with a sentimental or humorful scene. Malignant, however, left me on the edge of my seat the entire time and kept me in the stress of wondering when the next scare or twist would appear. The cinematography and score was also incredible, but that was to be expected! My only complaint was the ending, as I'm sure you have seen from other reviewers. This movie went from the typical horror movie, nobody is saved ending, to nevermind everyone is okay and the evil is gone. It was honestly cheesy and left me thinking, ""Wait, that's it?!"". I wanted more. I wanted the horror of the final moments, that push towards terror. Instead, I got a bland send-off. All in all though, it is thoroughly enjoyable and a current much-watch!",Malignant

1065,msmi-41284,A schizoid horror movie in more ways than one. Exciting but self-indulgent.,7,3 October 2021,"Malignant is a movie of two minds, both figuratively and literally. First, it's a wildly exciting new offering from horror maestro James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Insidious). Timid nurse Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is pregnant with a lazy, abusive jerk for a husband. How bad is he? In the first few minutes of the movie, he promptly leaves our heroine bloodied with a cracked skull. Madison locks herself in her room and passes out, and that night, her husband is brutally murdered by a shadowy, long-haired figure. Soon after, Madison begins seeing people she doesn't know getting murdered while it happens. The murderer is Gabriel, Madison's imaginary childhood friend--or was he? Madison's sister Sydney (Maddie Hasson) tracks down the mystery to (you guessed it) an abandoned mental hospital, and the frenetic conclusion is a gory slash-a-thon that would make Sam Raimi proud.Marks a decidedly different approach to horror for Wan, and while I was entertained throughout, I never felt captivated or enthralled by it, as I had with his other films. At times, the movie feels like an amalgamation of things Wan likes (old horror movies, analog radios, VCRs, dry ice, synthesizers, industrial music, goth clothes, etc.), combined in a chemistry set. The resulting explosions, while always eye-catching, seem to be more for Wan's benefit than ours. In all the mayhem, the human connection gets lost. Regardless, there's still a lot to enjoy here, and if you are willing to accept the movie on its terms, it's an exciting ride.",Malignant

There is also a HUGE bombshell which deals with the protagonist's family dynamic and would have made this movie more interesting if explored more, but the three characters who it should affect just shrug it off like some obscure fact and move on.New characters pop up within the 3rd Act without any explanation as to who they are and we don't care about them either.

And that's being generous. After the big reveal at the midpoint, it turns into a straight-up CGI action movie. Fairly shoddy CGI at that. Not surprisingly, the CGI-driven action makes the second half of the film feel much more like a cheap Marvel knock-off than a horror movie.

The general premise felt juvenile and dated, like a teenager fanfic imaging an edgy son of Michael Myers and Freedy Kruger, with an overworked soundtrack that actually substracts atmosphere from the movie -specially the edgy and cringy Pixies cover, and over the top CGI and post production that sometimes made me feel like I was watching a blood soaked Harry Potter.Truly a shame because Wan was always a director that tried to propose intelligent and new things within the Hollywood formula. Saw -the first one- was madly clever and tense. Insidious was truly daring and, I dare say, original; definitely his most interesting work. The Conjuring 1 and 2 less so, but tightly directed and intelligently contended. Wan was as good as popcorn horror can get. Was.",Malignant

Then comes the ending where Gabriel kills the entire police department. Then he attempts to kill Madison's sister Sydney and the mother. So Madison takes back her mind and body right? Forever shutting Gabriel away. That's fantastic right? Well my issue is, an entire police department is dead, as well as a ton of other bodies. We should get some kind of answer as to who is responsible I feel. Ya can't just kill 30 people and nobody be responsible. But how does it end, mom in a bed and Sydney and Madison holding each other.

I watch allot of horror and this was paced well enough to keep me interested had proper gore and a mystery to solve. On paper it should get a 10 but the execution is a 5 so I'll give it a seven. It does have humor but in a evil dead 1 way where it is so off the rails you can't help laughing as it has asked you to believe the spectacle. I did find it enjoyable but took it as seriously as slither or critters. If you are expecting seriously semi believable horror you will rate it a 1 or 2. If your just along for the ride it's a solid 7. Was a nice change of pace from the slow burn indie horror movies that have seem to be on every streaming service.,Malignant

The thing would have been completely destroyed after the first couple of blows. I get the whole, ""Gabriel is a parasite"" but where did the powers come from?! There is no explanation for them!

1151,bonaspiemolsen,Ridiculous and no logic,3,8 September 2021,"A majority of the reviews on this movie seemed to be fake, but I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt and saw it in the theatre, at the end I was just laughing at how bad some parts of this movie were. Which is not really what you want to accomplish in a horror.The plot in this movie is not very good, the story provides some twists, but the characters are very average and the story is filled with plot convenience and almost no logic. First of all the main protagonist can't remember anything from before the age of 8, but then later it is revealed she also can't remember parts of her upbringing with her new family. Suddenly the police bring in a hipnotist, who just with no logic can unlock the memories of the proganist for plot convenience.Gabriel the villain in this movie is some weird tumourmonster with astonishing speed and power. He is able to kill an entire police force, whereas before he couldn't even handle one detective, also extremely convenient how exactly the three characters from the police with the most screentime are the only ones to survive the altercation.The ending was extremely cliche as we have this host vs intruder in my body conflict where the protagonist wins in a very cringey manner, by standing up for herself and having the stronger mind.This whole movie seems to miss its identity as it shifts between genres, it goes from horror to mystery to comedy to crazy action, the music is terrible and annoying and the dialogue is bang average.Some scenes are cool and fun if you can ignore the logic, the best thing about this movie is the cinematogrophy, but at times i'ts almost a bit overdone, just like this whole movie.",Malignant

This type of movie would have thrived back in the 80's. Unfortunately, the modern-era of horror has not adopted the bloody/slasher-type movies with the same loving arms that once held them so tight.This films remains highly entertaining and enjoyable, partly due to how different it is from just about any other current, mainstream horror movie.

The biggest reason being I have come to expect so much more from James Wan when it comes to horror. This man brought us Insidious and The Conjuring. His triumphant return to horror after venturing out to blockbuster films was this hot pile of mundane garbage?? The so called ""twist"" is super predictable and there is not a single moment of actual horror in the two hour run time. I was bored and waiting for the misery to end. Even Joseph Bishara couldn't help with his score. One positive for the film is the cinematography. Wan has that special touch that can't be matched when it comes to setting up a scene. Too bad every single scare falls completely flat. I am having trouble believing the guy who made the scariest movies of the past decade made this lackluster snooze fest.

Unfortunately the main character was under-developed until about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through the movie, and they just dropped alp the info on you. No real development just BOoM.The story is rather predictable. The cop element is kind of an after thought and sprinkled in there just to elongate the film. Most of the characters aren't developed so it's just kinda watching a mish mash of people who happen to cross paths. Even the relationship between the sisters isn't developed well.To add to it, all the main character does is scream and cry. It's quite annoying. The music adds to the cheese factor...it comes on at the worst times and LOUD.Once the big reveal happens, you're definitely let down. It is just more like ""oh"". The SFX is pretty bad, too.In the end, I'm really glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters. I would have been very angry. It's a decent concept, but doesn't feel like it was well thought out or that anyone spent time developing the story. It was more like ""we have this person, this person, this element, the end.""Too many clichés, very corny, poorly acted by the main character, and not scary.

1232,elystonhayden-19893,Operatic slasher,8,11 September 2021,"Really enjoyed this one from Wan. If you are a lover of vintage 60s/70s/80s horror suspense especially the Italian Giallo sort. Then this is a lot of fun. Recalls the greats like Dario Argento (Susperia, Tenebrae) Mario Brava (Blood and Black Lace, The Evil Eye) and Lucio Fulci (The New York Ripper, Don't Torture a Duckling)These camp trash masters went for high shock thrillers with a masked killer on the loose committing outlandish murders on unsuspecting victims. Leading to twists and turns and a few plots holes but all in the name of fun and entertainment and a dash of glamour.These midnight giallo movies from the 60s and seventies got censored heavily and became hard to find and collectable creating an underground market. American filmmakers payed attention and took inspiration from them and so came your Halloween, Friday the 13th and Carrie even Scream and many, many more.Malignant is a neon soaked homage to the giallo genre and in my mind a humorous artful one at that. The fact that James Wan made this off the bat off the massive studio success of Aquaman intrigues even more. This is not a mainstream movie, be warned! It's out there blood soaked and kooky. He's taken a risk, maybe this will pay off give him more of a cult status, who knows. This and Insidious are my favourites from him.Dare I say in some of the vision bits it has a bit of A Nightmare on elm street and even a hint of aussie 70's telekinesis body horror Patrick (1978). The jail bit near the end really was cool and violent and funny. But I did kinda think not using the old hospital a bit more was a missed opportunity, it would have made for a fantastic set piece could have gone really over the top with it! Italian Giallo was all for the camp and spectacular.The irony in this is those films were made on the cheap but this looks expensive with the sets and the effects, Why not though hope it starts an underground filmmaking trend again. Not a mainstream film as the marketing suggests, a big budget alternative horror romp. The latest reel of Hollywood horror needed a good shake up, was getting so boring! Can I also say watch Censor (2021) if you like this kind of thing. I give Malignant a 8/10.",Malignant

1241,Duysterwald,Very disappointing. You're better off watching something like AHS: Freak Show instead.,5,3 September 2021,"It is in the final hour of Friday, September 3th that I begin writing my review for ""Malignant"". I had seen the film at the earliest possible opportunity, which in my neck of the woods was the showing of 21:30 on September 2nd (yesterday evening). A day or two before I went to see the film, I noticed that there were no reviews available for the film anywhere. Not even here. I suspect that this was by design, in that it was likely an attempt by the studios to keep the poor quality of this film hidden for as long as was realistically possible.At the moment, there are 44 reviews for ""Malignant"" on here. Out of those, 31 reviews were written by brand new accounts (created on September 1st at the earliest). Of these, one rated the film a 9, and the rest rated it a 10. Most of these reviews are superficial and insubstantial, sometimes written in rather poor English. It seems to me that these people are living in developing countries and were paid to write glowing reviews for the film. In other words: you cannot trust their opinion, as it was bought.The remaining 13 reviews were written by accounts whose age varies from 2 months old to 16 years old. Out of those, only three rated the film a 10. The rest rated the film a 1 (5 reviews), 6 (one review), 7 (one review) and 8 (three reviews). Yes, I checked every single one of them. Moral of the story: if you care at all about the honesty and reliability of a review, then always check the age of an account. It will give you an idea of how trustworthy the reviewer in question is.With that said, ""Malignant"" is a disappointment in my eyes. If you ask me, it was not made with the same care as previous James Wan films, such as ""Insidious"" and especially ""The Conjuring"". This film is empty, hollow and superficial. It has no heart, even though it is intended to have one. The emotional aspects of the film feel quite forced, i.e. Paint-by-the-numbers. A lot of the emotional stuff is rushed and glossed over as well. For example: Madison informs her younger sister that she (Madison) was adopted. This is life-changing news, partly because it means that there is no biological relation to her sister, who is the biological child of Madison's adoptive parents. Yet the sister barely has any reaction to that bombshell of news, and doesn't really address it until the final scenes of the film.Apart from that, this film has no genuinely scary moments whatsoever. It doesn't even come close to, say, ""The Conjuring 3"" - let alone the original film of the series! This is more like a detective/mystery film with a bit of a supernatural touch to it. I would not call this horror at all. Supernatural drama might be a bit of a better descriptor, or even science fiction. So, if you love horror or at least a good scare, then don't spend your hard-earned money on a ticket for this film. You will not find what you seek.Lastly, the concept of this film was already tackled (to some degree) in ""American Horror Story: Freak Show"". Specifically the character of Edward Mordrake, who was played by Wes Bentley. Despite the limited screentime, those in charge of the show did a better job with him and his parasitic twin. He definitely felt more menacing than Gabriel, the parasitic twin of Madison.All in all, this film is a huge let-down. Uninspired, rather clichéd and without a heart or soul. James Wan can do so much better than this. I wonder what happened? Perhaps he was obliged to make this film for contractual reasons? I cannot think of any other reason for why he clearly was not truly (emotionally) invested in this film.",Malignant

But in this case, I was shocked to see that something different was brought to the table. However, the plot twist that neared the end wasn't as complex to figure out. Not only that, but the beginning sort of dragged out and-during a lot of parts-lost my interest. However, I will say that the end of the film was definitely a thrill with all the gore and violence.

While the fight scenes were great fun and the parkour pretty epic it's just plain stoopid so you really have to switch off the old noggin for this one.

If you asked any stranger on the street to list the things that freak them out, it's in this film for one scene but because the scares are so broad and common place, every jump feels like you predicted it moments before it happened. Every part of this story feels like a horror cliche taken to such an extreme that none of it feels believable. I didn't believe the main plot, didn't believe half the characters, didn't buy the sets or the costumes. I don't even believe the person who wrote the score knew anything about horror films beyond being told a scary story once over a camp fire when they were 10 that made them get goosebumps a bit, maybe. Yhe only characters I liked felt as if they were pasted in to some comedy gore cartoon but weren't notified. I can tell the director desperately wanted to make their dream B horror movie masterpiece buy by shoving everytrope into one clunky story, it all became a cliche you couldn't even laugh at.

1265,amberchester1,I cannot believe I forced myself to watch this,3,19 September 2021,I kept checking the time this movie was running. I thought an hour had passed but nope I was only I tout for less than 30 min. This movie was excruciating to watch. I assume most who have given it high marks is because they like campy B movies. But this ain't it either. Just a terrible plot for a movie and the acting was so hammed up ugh.Yes I watched the whole thing. No it wasn't good. I can guarantee you that tomorrow night I'll watch something good. Idk if I've seen it before. I was just trying to waste some time and boy was it wasted.,Malignant

After the initial befuddlement settles in, there's nothing really of substance here.It can't decide if it wants to be a boring ""serious"" horror movie with generic characters and bad dialog or an insanely absurd schlock-fest. Consequently it ends up being a badly stitched version of both, which doesn't compliment either one and fully exposes their many faults.",Malignant
1267,mc2sf,Gothic melodramatic fun,8,22 September 2021,"Atmospheric, gothic horror. Stylized with oblique angles,saturated reds, and mystical locales, the film is aesthetically intriguing look at.

I think this film will grow on the viewer with time, and age well, becoming a beloved horror classic.",Malignant
1268,SuperEnrico95,A little surprise,8,3 September 2021,"I have always appreciated James Wan. His horror films are mainly dedicated to the general public, they are not horro of the type of The Lighthouse or Babadook, but despite this he has always managed to make excellent entertainment works, showing everyone how this type of film should be made, putting us however care and commitment.This Malignant was certainly one of the films that I was looking forward to with interest, also because nothing had leaked about the story and there was a certain aura of mystery. Initially I believed in a supernatural story in the style of Insidious (judging from the trailers) and instead I changed my mind almost immediately.Already with the prologue we understand that Wan will tend to change the cards on the table and it is something that he will do in certain key points of the story.The first part will be based on the construction of the characters and the beginning of the investigation.The second will be the search for truth, carried out by Madison, Sydney and detective Kekoa, in which interesting theories about who this elusive Gabriel could be will come out.The third part instead will have the revelation and will also be the bloody moment of the whole film.Wan manages to manage a simple story that in several points manages to surprise the viewer and, through his direction, also manages to create a fairly elaborate staging and really good moments, whether they are horror, thriller or even d ' action.The characters are well characterized, they won't be complex or multi-faceted, but they will do their job well and we will really appreciate their interactions.A really great film, which demonstrates how Wan is still capable of creating great horror without having to repeat himself. I hope to see this director again in other horror films.",Malignant

James Wan had one too many, wrote down what he in a drunken state thought was the 'coolest movie plot ever', and then apparently never sobered up.Some movies push the boundaries, mixing up genres, introducing wild and thought-provoking ideas - this movie is just pushing up daisies.

Sound great songs used in totally wrong places and the music was always too loud for the scene. Some of the score was really cheesy sounding. More like something from a B movie instead of something by an A list talent. Being someone who has very sensitive hearing I am a bit of a snob when it comes to music.

Not one character, including the leading protagonist is memorable, nor convincing. The detectives are useless and seem like their on the verge of laughing at how ridiculous the premise is.I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. This will not become a ""Cult Classic"" like some have said. The antagonist is not a character that will go down in history like Mike Myers, Chucky, Freddy, etc.It was too long and repetitive. The over the top kill sprees weren't entertaining or unique. The story is similar to Stephen King's The Dark Half, which is better than what James Wan concocted.A waste of time, but Warner Bros only cares about quantity instead of quality.

This is the worst film (ala my particular taste) I feel he's made! HOWEVER I can see that it touches on some classic cult themes and maybe this is what he was trying to get across.

Anyone rating this higher than a one, I have to truly question your standards. Malignant gives it away as to what this is about. I guess it's my fault I didn't take it literal when starting the movie. Does it ever explain how good old ""Gabriel"" is the world's best fighter or how it can affect lights, radio waves and so forth to communicate?

It worked.The body horror in it is great, the actions scenes are super juicy and to be fair quite new in horror films, considering how stylised they were. The plot twist was damn good and the trip of the third act alone made me want to go back and watch it again.Can't forget to mention the soundtrack.... THE SOUNDTRACK!!

The dialogue that came out the actors mouths was jarringly bad and cliche, it was like from a 50s cheap horror movie. I cant tell you much more than this because I stopped watching after that scene, and thats the only reason I gave it two stars cause I figured whatever comes after that would be a step up so it gets one more start for that.Gotta say, its been a while since I saw any movie starts so bad.

I believe he made this film for pure fun & that's awesome & must be liberating. Something you'd watch on a date night or with friends is ideal.

When Madison is locked up in jail, all the other women in the holding cell are such stereotypes, it's like something from Prisoner Cell Block H - bad haircuts everywhere!Also, when Sydney is driving up to abandoned mental hospital the sun is splitting the sky, yet a few moments later upon her arrival its pitch black, everything is always scarier by torchlight 🤔 Added to which who parks their car on the edge of a cliff...There are lots of cliché moments in Malignant which are just cringy and if this film wasn't so funny, it would be truly awful.You've been warned.",Malignant

I have read some reviews that are definitely real and not paid for that say this movie is reminiscent of 80's horror flicks, but that goes right out the window with all the splashes of cgi blood that could've easily been done with practical effects. I can go on and on about how weak the script was (the scene in the police station reminded me of a scene out of the screenplay me and my buddies drew up in 5th grade), the clichés, or the lack of any real nuance, but the worst part of the film is that it fails to draw you in. After 45 mins or so I found myself staring at my phone and I had to will my eyes to stay on the screen. You start to wonder who or what the killer is, but there's no real digging until the end so instead of any kind of story you just get one ""gruesome"" murder after another. This movie might scare the kids, but anyone older than 14 has seen this all before. I've also read reviews saying the film was funny. It is not.I did,however, like the score, but it did feel very ""resident evil"". I think this would've fleshed out better if they went in a more action/horror film from the beginning, but it's like watching an hour of ""the conjuring"" and then the warrens bust out some jet li moves while dodging a barrage of bullets.Overall I think James wan wanted to make a crowd pleaser, but it fell hard and flat.",Malignant

1322,robertperner1980,Another director loses his magic after selling out with blockbusters,1,11 September 2021,"James Wan made a name for himself with standout horror movies like Saw, Insidious and the Conjuring. He was (and to some fans still is) one of the biggest names in the genre. And this is what makes his fall from grace so disheartening. After the excellent The Conjuring 2 he turned to big blockbuster action franchises and lost his identity. How can you tell Wan's entry in the Fast and Furious franchise from the others based on directing style? Or how can you tell which of the many superhero movies of the last decade is his? Right, you can't. While some action directors manage to put their personal stamp on their blockbusters, others succumb to the conformity that is expected of these movies and turn their backs to their fans of old. Maybe Wan's return to the horror genre with Malignant was meant to pay tribute to said fans who helped him become famous in the first place, but if that is indeed so, it failed.You may have noticed a pattern with famous directors and their movies becoming bloated as time goes on. Let's call it ""intimidated editor syndrome"". Redundant scenes that give out the same exact information the audience is already aware of, similar horror scenes with the same purpose happening close to each other without story development scenes in between to space them out and give them room to breathe, and just generally weird, incoherent and abrupt editing are par for the course. To top it off, the camerawork suffers from Wan's action directing as well, with almost no steady/static shots. You may have noticed that most of the world's scariest horror scenes use static shots, but I guess Wan didn't pay attention or was convinced that he could reinvent the wheel. Then again, this supposed ""horror"" movie fittingly turns into an action movie in the second half anyway, so it's not like Wan was scaring us. If it was his intention after all, well, he failed miserably.Can I recommend this movie? Maybe. Do you like watching bad movies to make fun of them? Then yes, this movie is for you. However if you are expecting to be scared, then avoid this movie at all costs. Here I was thinking The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It would have been much better had Wan directed it, but now I'm taking it back. Watch the new Conjuring movie instead and be glad that he had nothing to do with it.Let me conclude with a line from the movie which the writers probably thought was clever and memorable, but ended up being cringeworthy instead: ""It's time to cut out the cancer."" I like to picture the ""cancer"" being the part of James Wan's brain that makes action movies. Too bad he didn't realize that action can only be mixed with a very specific type of horror, but certainly not with horror that should have been more subtle.1/10 for bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, bad cinematography, bad CG and most of all: Bad directing. Throw a rock and you'll hit a better horror movie than this one.",Malignant

So when my sister asked me to go watch this one in the theater I said yes.I know everyone has a different opinion and that's fine, that what makes discussing movies fun! So with that in mind, here is my personal opinion;What the actual f#@$?!The first scene had me thinking this was satire. The acting alone had me laughing out loud because I couldn't believe this was serious. The main character had ZERO interest from me, I didn't find her likeable whatsoever. Then it started to get a little better, there was some tension, good camerawork overall and I hoped it would change for the better. I thought the further we got I had the story figured out (I was kinda right) but that doesn't make a movie less enjoyable.But then..Who approved of this movie? Who read the script/screenplay and was like; ""yeah, this could work.""*minor spoiler coming*
WHO APPROVED THAT WANNABE MATRIX SCENE?????I NEVER walked out of a movie before but I was SO close. The only reason I stayed was because I paid good money.I really just can't understand how this movie came to be.

Furthermore, the ""twin"" is able to contort the hosts body (with audible bone snapping) without the host experiencing any pain or discomfort when regaining control.Also, this ""twin"" wipes out an entire barrack of law enforcement just before the film ends. As sirens and lights are heard and seen during the last shot, the watcher must ask oneself;

For the first hour the movie is pretty slow and not much is explained so you're left wondering what's really going on ,tbh I started to get bored after a certain point but when I tell you that the last half an hour was worth every single minute before it I mean it . All of a sudden the movie becomes so weird ,campy and extra af !!! The explanation of everything you've been wondering about as well as the scenes accompanying the explanation are so dramatic and over the top but in a very soap opera and B movie kind of way that almost becomes funny and even though it's a horror movie in todays age it really has that feeling of older horror movies from the 80s and 90s with how weird and over the top it gets , the special effects are not good let's be real but I think that that's what they were going for so as to add to the dramaticness of the Storyline they created , the dialogue is really basic and again reminiscent of a soap opera but it's what gives this movie its character and ties up the whole thing together . To conclude this movie IMO is being advertised as another Basic horror film whereas in reality I think it's a really nice tribute to 80s horror films and B movies : 9/10.",Malignant

And oh booyyyy I don't think anyone can be prepared for this, just buckle in and enjoy the ride. For the first hour and a half it's a muddled sort of (humorless) parody of the overly dramatic blue-gray filtered semi-supernatural horror movies of the mid 2000s. Suddenly it's a hilarious body-horror action gore-fest for about 12 minutes, before closing with some cheesy over-dramatic acting and no satisfying resolution....... I wouldn't recommend paying to watch the film, but I would recommend watching it for the experience.Edited to add that I saw a few reviews saying this was a giallo, and I do not agree at all.

Some may find this stupid, terrible, lazy, etc., but I found it entertaining with a dash of stupid. 7/10 and I'd watch it again.",Malignant

This is easily, for me, a 10/10 horror film.The first half of the movie sets a slow pace which may turn some off, but it is necessary for the later half of the movie. Subtle hints are provided to the watcher and if they pay attention enough they will see the clues pointing to the answers that initially escape the characters in the story.The later half of the movie is where the climax begins and it does not disappoint. When I found out that someone from the movie ""Saw"" was involved with the production of this movie, I had no doubts about how I would feel at the end. I was not left disappointed. In fact, I wanted more. This movie screams ""SEQUEL!"" in every possible way.I truly love this movie. I tip my hat, and bow to the people involved in production of this fine horror film. I wish there were more movies like this.",Malignant

The thing I really hated was the soundtrack, they use this fast tempo music a lot and it makes you feel like you're watching a trailer, not an actual movie, if you know what I mean.

His talent made this very confusing script a watchable movie. But, honestly, the story is a mess, a pastiche of all horror movies clichés that overall seems written by a random algoritm.I know the horror gender (of which I'm a fan as well) uses a lot of clichés, but when I saw the creepy wood house that seemed right out from anything from ""Psycho"" to ""Amytiville"" or even ""The Conjuring"", I know it wasn't a good start.Next, we have a creepy girl with long black hair, VHS tapes and a hospital built on a cliff. Samara, is that you? Oh, no, the girl's name is Madison.Then, we have a villain who uses a distorced voice and never shows his true face. Jigsaw? Oh, wrong again. Sorry, Gabriel.For the most part, the movie seems to pay homage to giallo movies, specially the ones directed by Dario Argento. The lighting / color scheme in most scenes look heavily borrowed from ""Suspiria"" or ""Inferno"", while the misterious villain wearing black leather coat and gloves is a true Argento trademark seen in almost all of his movies, from ""Deep Red"" to ""Tenebre"". Even the poster retains some elements from ""Opera"" (the blade pointing to a wide opening eye).But then, the story takes a gore twist which lead us to a movie that could be signed by David Cronenberg (and I don't want to give any spoilers).The end is abrupt and, frankly, disappointing.If the director were any other than James Wan himself, the movie could be a total disaster. He frankly saved it, giving atmosphere and suspense. I had high expectations for this film, and honestly I was a little disappointed.",Malignant

Malignant is not a horror movie, and if you go in with high expectations of a horror movie, then odds are you will highly be disappointed. Think of it more of a slasher film, because to its roots, that's what it is. I think it has that good balance between jump scares and laughs. It reminds me of some Friday the 13th movies, or even Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street. A slasher, that has superhuman abilities, who doesn't really die in the end, but really, leaves the door open for sequels. If you are a fan of slasher films like those, then you would most definitely enjoy this one too. I think it's a fun watch honestly.",Malignant

1443,gxtkgkj,"Predictable, boring, and laughably bad.",3,6 October 2021,"I've seen a lot of bad horror movies. Some of them are kind of good in a guilty pleasure way. This is not one of those movies. It's pretty boring for the first 40 minutes or so of the movie, and when it starts to pick up, the major plot points are so painfully obvious that it nearly gave me a headache. The CGI fighting was hilarious, so if you have about 2 hours to waste to get a couple laughs and have a new movie to make fun of, that might make this somewhat enjoyable for you.Other than that though, if you watched this movie hoping to experience a real suspenseful horror film with a well thought plot, you watched the wrong movie, my friend. The acting is horrendous. The screams are forced and cringy. The choreographies look dumb. Why can Gabriel/Madison manipulate electricity? I dunno. Cause electroshock therapy? Maybe? It's never explained. Why? Who cares why? It's James Wan!!!The ending sucked, was also predictable, and left a lot of plot holes wide open. Gabriel/Madison kills an entire police department but it's just hunky dory cause she told Gabe no more being bad. What???!! In what universe???? A better ending would have been if Madison had turned the gun on herself, and I was hoping for that to redeem the movie a little bit but nope. Happily ever after, right?Don't waste your time unless you've just got time to waste and you expect nothing more out of this than some cheap, cheesy CGI and a couple laughs from bad acting.",Malignant

Forced comedy in odd places, no one acting seriously, the music was out of place, zero scares or atmosphere, felt like a bunch of scenes sewn together, very odd.HOWEVER, I did find the third act to be fun, but it was not enough to save the rest of the movie.Maybe watch this when nothing else is on TV but certainly don't spend your money on it.",Malignant

Anyone with half a brain (a bunch of which you'll see throughout the film), could predict the storyline and how it ultimately culminates into a an ending as unsatisfying as the fact that you just spent 2 hours of your life witnessing a glorified student film.One of the most horrific elements of the film comes in the form of its train wreck of a score.

1500,nemoacademystudent,Top notch horror from Wan,10,3 September 2021,"Horror movie enthusiasts know very well how hard it is to find, nowadays, decent quality horror products.In the best of cases, most horror movies are somehow enjoyable yet unremarkable.Director James Wan once again directs a movie with effective scares, extremely sick atmosphere, engaging plot and, above all, one of the best (so to speak) and creepiest monsters to-date.After a very long time, a horror movie plot finally managed to engage me and take me by surprise with a very clever ending twist (it might remind you of some other classic thrillers/horrors, but I can assure you it's never been done this way). There's just a bunch of questions I still can't find an answer to, but every attempt to do so feels very satisfying, as not many horror movies push you to do that.While Wan's direction might feel somehow classic (like in the Conjuring series), it's undeniably effective and very deeply thought. It also fits the story incredibly well, as Wan is also credited in the movie's plot writers list. After the Conjuring series, he could finally work again on an original subject!The movie's atmosfere reminds of 80s-90s classic horror movies, yet it can rely on tons of personality and successfully manages to use horror movie tropes in a very creative and clever way. I did love how they distorted famous songs to create the creepy atmosphere, too (those who have already watched the movie will easily understand what I mean).Finally, a word spent for the... Thing. That monster designers will never be praised enough for their creation... That will probably haunt my dreams during the 2 or 3 weeks to come! I think the best thing about it all is that, in the end, you suddenly realize why IT is the way it is!Finally, Malignant is one of the best horror movies I can remember. It has everything a very good horror movie should have: an eerie atmosphere, an engaging and shocking plot and, above all, one of the creepiest monsters I've ever had the pleasure (!?) to watch on the big screen.Give it a shot, it will likely surprise you!",Malignant

It does certainly pay to tribute to some of its inspirations such as A Nightmare On Elm Street, and even James Wan's very own Insidious, pulling off a story using horror tropes from another film while trying to make something new and original is something I do get picky with, but all I can really say here is that I've seen way worse and this film really tries its best not to lose touch with its story, even though the spirit of the film doesn't quite overshadow all of its flaws.",Malignant

The CGI is OTT and the acting from everyone leaves a lot to be desired. James Wan made a big mistake with this. He shouldn't involve his wife, Ingrid Bisu, in any more movies because it's clearly never a good idea. No wonder Malignant flopped so hard at the BO. Wan should go back to whoever helped him with the Insidious movies and Conjuring 1 & 2. They know what they are doing.",Malignant

While some scenes are way over the top or not even explained such as being able to control electricity, how the sibling can go against an entire police force, and finally how scenes are cut with the over the top score.I would recommend this film if you were bored or wanted to see some blood.

I respect my fellow human being too much. If you aren't coming in with Wish Upon or other similar 'so bad it's hilarious' horror films under your belt you will leave confused and angry.The movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It starts out like a cheesy B grade 80s horror movie, goes on to sad family drama, and somehow by the end it has turned into parkour John Wick with a Meat man that runs like Naruto and yeets chairs at cops.The soundtrack was incredibly awkward and it didn't know what it wanted to be. At one point a song that sounded like it would kick off a bad home alone montage began playing but the scene was over 10 seconds later.The whiplash of every scene ending and moving on to a completely unrelated one never let me breathe to take in or process information. By the end of the film I was left a broken man who couldn't stop cackling at the absurdity.Watch this film if you want to see how to destroy your career as a celebrated director in 2 hours or less.

1541,jonathangdunn,"A sad, unfortunate attempt to create a film worth your time.",1,11 September 2021,"For horror fans everywhere including myself, this film wreaks of trying to make itself a franchise instead of containing itself to one, well done horror addition. This film is overcompensating with cheap jump scares to make you forget about the poorly written plot. Malignant is best viewed on a Sunday afternoon while you vacuum and clean your home while having it on in the background, and even that's being generous.Malignant offers nothing new in a day and age where horror fans expect to be thrilled and kept guessing. It's an embarrassing montage of confusing plot holes riddled with poorly written characters with some random, honestly boring, kills mixed in. It's best described as a 13 year old's best attempt at horror/action. It turns into a completely convoluted circus two thirds of the way through and suddenly you're watching the latest ""Jason Bourne"" instead of horror. There's no reliability in the writing, there's not a single moment grounded in any actual science, the explanations are laughable. It's confusing, it's not well structured, it's predictable, but most importantly (and most detrimentally) it's just boring.Side note, the films soundtrack is. . . Completely in the wrong genre. It's some sort of unholy offspring between indie rock and metal. In any case, it's completely wrong. Luckily it doesn't ruin the tone of the movie as Malignant has no tone to start with.",Malignant

I also feel large portions of the film could have been edited out without affecting the storyline continuity, perhaps up to a full half of the film.. I'd swear this is a remake of a similar movie I saw years ago, but, I can't be 100% sure.The monster was a surprise, for sure. The storyline is not as advertised, I don't want to spoil it, so leave it at that.The music, which usually creates the mood could have been much more suspenseful. I didn't find the movie ""scary"", suspenseful, a small bit, almost turned it off to watch reruns of a sitcom I've seen over 100 times.

It just continues to get madder and when you think right, that's as mad as it can get, there's like another 30-40 mins of madness.

Like unfiltered Stranger Things on crack.",9,12 September 2021,"I'm probably one of the highest reviewers here, and I believe I am for good goddamn reason. Sure the premise of the movie is a little ridiculous and it's more of an action thriller than a movie that is really meant to scare you, but it is undoubtedly AWESOME. There are little to no cliched moments throughout the film, and during many if not all of the more ""cliched"" scenes, the director makes the deft choice of swerving your typical horror cliche expectations, keeping the pacing nice and the events unexpected. The concept of the movie is something I have never seen in a horror film before, and the antagonist in general (personality, motives, abilities) and the way it is portrayed/ developed is WONDERFUL. It isn't SUPER gorey, although it does have its fair share of graphic scenes, but they aren't extremely realistic and are TOTALLY stomachable if you have the tolerance you would just generally need to watch pretty much any horror movie ever. I'm a pretty squeamish guy and even I could watch this while eating. Not to mention, this gore is done quite well IMO (not realistic to the point of being vomit inducing, and looks visually cool enough to make up for the grossness, plus there's never really a focus on any one piece/ visual of gore in particular for too long). I mean come on how are you gonna complain about gore while watching a horror thriller film you brainlet simians. The only downsides are the acting (aside from the main actress's performance, which I think was very well done), and some of the more trivial dialogue writing, which unfortunately comes off as pretty out of place and just poorly written/ stupid a lot of the time. Another potential downside is that this movie isn't so much scary as it is just high key badass. If you really want to see something that will scare you or something with a nice sense of eerie unease and dread, skip this movie, but if you want to see something you never expected and that just totally kicks ass, do not pass it up. Some (dumbass) people have been complaining in the reviews about the ending, I think it's perfectly fine given the story, like there's really no other satisfying way they could've wrapped the film up, the plot being what it is. Overall, I really really loved this movie- the way it developed from what you were shown in the trailer and what you expected out of it, to what it actually was in reality was amazing and this film 100% doesn't fall victim to the issue of having a plotline that you can intuit completely from a couple of scenes or implied story direction queues. This film is a wonderful watch, and if you're paying attention and aren't an idiot or psycho who thinks anything unrealistic/ not absolutely terrifying and traumatizing isn't worth your time, you will definitely enjoy this unique, one of a kind, rollercoaster ride of a horror movie. Looking forward to more like this from Mr. James Wan.",Malignant

1581,salwayjack,"It's a bit silly, sure. But...",7,12 September 2021,"I liked this film, and my opinion is something... I can't tell people it's not a bad film who think that it is, because I'm sure that if you showed these people old Giallo movies, they probably wouldn't like them either, which is totally cool. Or maybe they would like them, and this film in particular just isn't their cup of tea, I don't know. But, at the core of the movie is a ballsy idea that you'd think belongs in a comic book. If people believed that taking these sorts of risks equals a BAD film, then unfortunately, we will get a lot of the same shhhtuff. Which I don't want. The worst kinds of films are boring ones. This is not boring. At least in concept. People may get bored, but then I don't really know what people want. And, I don't think most people know what they want either, besides to moan all the time. Here's a thought, the world will probably end pretty soon, and fun is pretty much the only currency that has any value these days, so you might as well learn to love directors like James Wan, because they're going to try their hardest to give you the best rollercoaster ride into the apocalypse that they can...

The depiction of Seattle was very inaccurate: I've lived in Seattle for 3+ years and only once have I seen a thunderstorm or heavy rains. Unless that ugly baked potato on the back of her head can control the weather, all the thunder and lighting is pretty unlikely. The effects were also so bad and the plot and CGI was super cheesy. And not in a way that they were trying to be funny because there were no jokes in the whole movie.

Although not an accurate portrayal of Madison or ""Emily's"" condition, I think that was kinda the point and it certainly does a good job in a fantastical horror element. Gabriel's identity being revealed seemed a bit unrealistic but thrilling nonetheless and a few things seemed confusing, like the phone call Detective Kekoa gets from Gabriel during Madison's interrogation, but despite this minor confusion, the thrill was good and the plot twist was really enjoyable. I was kept guessing throughout the entire film, definitely recommended.",Malignant

As many people have pointed out, it has serious 80's horror vibes. I have seen people pointing out that the plot is dumb and isn't deep like the current slew of horror films out there. Let me say this, I love the A24 style of horror flick but I also appreciate the silly monster flick. Not to mention the twist. I thought it was predictable at first but I didn't predict all of it.

That's what I liked about it so much.The only reason I'm not scoring it higher was because in places (for me) the acting was quite weak and a lot of the effects looked 'PlayStation' (that's the only way I can describe it).But overall, very good.

I appreciate modern technology in the film industry, and this did not give me that. Chalking it up to personal preference, I started chuckling about how some of the scenes were illogical and unnatural for real life humans. Underground and you hear clanging? Oh, might as well check it out... In the dark... Alone... Not to mention the fact that you are standing literally next to the light switches and that you just got off work and would love to stay in an underground sewer/passage for a few.I just find the movie trying too hard to give its viewers a scare when the movie (most especially its vfx) just isn't scary. Of course, all this could have been a creative decision.One of the best points of the movie is its excellent use of foreshadowing to drop hints about the plot. This kept me guessing what would happen next, and when it did happen, was immediately a topic of discussion within our friend group. The twist admittedly dropped some jaws, but the buildup was executed well with enough hints to curb predictability. The movie setting seriously gave me an 80's to 90's vibe, and the acting definitely portrayed that era (no shade).Overall, this movie was a fun watch. Was it scary? No, but it sure was entertaining.I highly recommend watching this movie in a group.",Malignant

Actor's reactions, emotions and actions made no sense at times and were far from realistic. While different concepts, The Conjuring was good for many reasons.

People wonder into dark rooms and hallways without attempting to turn on lights. The detectives use no skills to solve the crime or try to figure out anything about the murders or crimes. It seems like everyone is lost. The sister visits a abandoned psychiatric clinic IN THE MIDDLE of the night instead of passing along the info she finds out to the detectives that have been trying to solve the crime the whole time.

Additionally, the pacing was spot on. The run time didn't drag out and there were very few moments where I found myself checking my watch due to boredom.Despite these, the film doesn't deliver in a lot of areas. The acting felt forced and the writing very rarely managed to actually match either the severity or the lightheartedness of certain scenes. I also felt that some characters were miscast which hindered some aspects of Malignant. Although the plot was fairly interesting, it felt too farfetched to make me actually care about what occurred. Along with the hard-to-believe scenes, the soundtrack felt so messy and poorly assembled that I struggled to connect with majority of the sequences.Overall, Malignant is nothing new, special or exciting. Despite setting up for an exciting second and third act, the film soon crumbles and produces an average at best horror/thriller. 5/10.",Malignant

But you can't look at the script without tears because it's disgusting.Most of the characters are not needed at all, and those that are as much as possible resemble furniture in them there is no life, this is some kind of parody.The narration is carried out at a ragged pace, at first confusing and then with mighty force makes you go from indignation to laughter. There are as many plot holes, illogical actions and inconsistencies here as if a 12-year-old child wrote a script.

The whole theatre was laughing when you first saw that thing.There are so many logical errors. Like when her sister was driving to the abandoned clinic at daylight and it was like 2 minutes away. When she arrived it was suddenly midnight. WTF was she doing? Did she take an extra long dumb?We had some really good laughs at it, but that was the only entertaining thing while watching.Don't watch this, it's a waste of time.",Malignant

They got lazy and didn't bother to at least try and make it believable. After all a movie that pulls you in is a good one especially when it comes to thrillers and horror flicks.Almost every waking scene in this movie is riddled with problems. Problems that are cringe worthy at times.To those saying, ""It's a cheesy horror flick meant to be stupid"" I say no. There's nothing in this movie that makes this movie a satire or homage to the classic horror films. The seriousness and tonality of this film tries poorly to make the audience feel scared but how can it when every scene is one dumb moment after another.The only thing scary about this movie is that someone gave them enough money to even make the film.",Malignant

The score oscillates between a tacky ""spooky"" rendition of the Pixies's Where Is My Mind, 90s alt rock, and Catpenteresque synth beats. Nothing is cohesive, a problem that the plot shares. At the very least, I can't accuse the film of being slow or boring; the opposite is true. Scenes have no time to breathe. No sooner is the hackneyed idea to expose the heroine to hypnotherapy brought up in the script than is the scene cut directly to that therapy session. The film is like a bad episode of American Horror Story. For that reason, it is oftentimes unintentionally hilarious, and thus still entertaining despite being a horrendous horror film. This may end up being a repeat viewing movie for me, simply because it gets so much wrong in such a fascinating way. A curious, huge misstep from a normally dependable horror director.

You need to be willing to laugh at horror if you want to enjoy the movie. It's by NO MEANS meant to be taken seriously like some other classics of James Wan.I thoroughly enjoyed myself the entire movie but only because I was laughing through most of it. I guess the trailers threw off people because it gives a whole different vibe than what the actual movie is about.It's definitely a tribute to that corny, classic kind of horror some of us love and miss.The communication of the plot twist gets messy towards the end, and that's probably my biggest issue with the movie. A couple of plot holes like why/how does Gabriel have to communicate through speakers? Why does he have influence over electricity? Where does the super strength come from?The change of pace at the end is bonkers and somehow we end up with this Matrix-like choreographed brutal, bloody, action scene that has you holding your face going ""WHAT IS HAPPENING???""The Pixies tribute is absolutely sick. I wish they would've brought it into the third act but unfortunately they didn't; added a sense of craziness earlier in the film.

However, I happened to love this movie, and while I understand, it kills me to see people rating it less stars in an attempt to level out the rating because of the fakes. James Wan is amazing. As a huge horror movie buff, I consider the first insidious to be among the most unsettling horror films released in the 21st century (alongside Hereditary which takes the cake for me). This is not your typical, modern horror film, and I love Wan for providing us with films that step much further outside the box than any other recent horror films are able to deliver to us. It's bloody, brutal, and absolutely shocking in my opinion. I'm literally in my fourth or fifth viewing of the film as I type this, and I still throughly enjoyed what I am watching.

Disappointment.,2,11 September 2021,"I'm a fan of Wan's movies, but I don't recognize his talent and his unique horror style in this movie.What went go wrong (in my opinion) one by one:1. The set. Mandatory fog in all places. Like in a music video clip. C'mon! You can built a massive atmosphere even without it.2. The cast/characters. I liked most actors in Wan's previous movies. But here the most of them just miscast. The characters behave illogically whenever it gets dark around them. When I see a dark place where scary sounds come from, it's obvious I'm jumping into it without a light source or a gun. I just ask the good old lines, ""Hello ?!"" ""is anyone here?"". Do these characters have night vision?3. The editing. The sound design is unique in places, but the cut and sound mixing is awful and doesn't fit the current scene.4. Plot holes and physics. A superhero power and ""appear in the background and then immediately disappear"" tricks?Are you serious??5. Clichés. Good cop. Bad cop. He/she word confusion. Big silence little scare. Little silence, then more silence, scare. A little twist in the middle of the movie. More silence indicates jumpscare. ""Nothing wrong. There's nothing here ..."" of course. We've seen this before. However, some are working at the beginning of the film.Who is the killer? Probably someone we never see live at the same time as the killer character?!Its a mess. A huge disappoinment.",Malignant

And not only did the conversation between characters pain me to endure, but the actors unbearable low level acting is the absolute worst part of this film.

The entire film is given to you in first 15 min if you pay close attention along with both trailers for the film. Once the 3rd act starts and they go over it all again you see huge flaws in the logic of the film. There are a few scenes such as fire escape and Seattle underground that completely fall apart when you look back at it. This would have been much more entertaining if they stuck with how it was advertised rather than a ridiculous plot. Maybe because I worked in medical field it came across as complete BS or the way they tried to explain everything away without any resolution.

To start, the acting in multiple scenes was hokey to the point of mock-Sharknado level. I couldn't tell if they were going for laughs or thrills but both were nonexistent. 2nd, the plot was easier to guess at than the writers would have hoped for. Maybe not with specifics, but the Siamese twin thing... called it 20 minutes in. No explanations for telepathic abilities, I guess that's just a choose your own adventure part of the movie, but honestly that's the least of this trash heap's issues.

At times it was very difficult to take any of the characters serious.

1844,toddjolley,Don't waste your money if anything watch on HBO max,4,14 September 2021,"They hype for this movie was there! I must admit that I was excited for this movie. Soon after watching I was very much disappointed.To start the the actor that plays Mandy was awe full. I don't know if it was because the script was so poorly written or if she is truely that bad of an actor. Maybe if the script was written better, then maybe the acting wouldn't have been so intolerable. The person who wrote this script made a movie that could have been completed in 45 minuets and dragged it out for an hour and 3 minutes longer. The best actors were the two cops who made this movie tolerableSecondly the situations these actors get in is just awful! When the cop is chasing Gabriel he never calls for back up and decides to chase this freakishly fast and agile ""demon"" by himself. Secondly when maddy's sister decides to go to the institution where ""Emily"" was housed at she decides to go by herself and park her car as close to a cliff as humanly possible and then decides to go in by herself and withhold information from the police resulting in the entire police departments death. And to to put the cherry on top of a terrible written script was the ending. Some how by a miracle of god she is able to take control of Gabriel at the last second and regress him to the back of her mind just after he/she likes 20 people and then poof the movie ends. The only part I enjoyed was the twist that Maddy/Emily was the one committing the murders! Besides that the movie was awful. It did have its exciting groomsome moments but overall whoever wrote the script to this should never be allowed to write in Hollywood again. Thank god I watched it on HBO instead of wasting my money to go to the theaters! All these people who say that the people who are writing low reviews are crazy probably don't know a good horror movie if it slapped them in the face.

Maybe there's some references I'm not picking up on or familiar with but the very first scenes are clue enough to set the calibre for the film... is it deliberately shot like a poor B movie? Is the acting deliberately hammy? The whole storyline might be ok if it wasn't so comedically executed, there was no suspense, no tense moments, it was so predictable and just awful.

A badly made movie is just that, a bad movie.The silver lining was the 3rd act of the movie (jail/police station scene ) that wasn't so bad, hence the 3 star rating, but then the lazily put together ending and the 'all too easy' overcoming of the malignant force made me glad I didn't pay to watch this hot mess of a movie.",Malignant

Some of the acting seemed a bit cringey. I love James Wan but this is definitely one of his worst films. When ""Gabriel"" was revealed to be a parasitic twin living off of Emily's brain and body, the first thing that came to my mind was the Edward Mordake urban legend. It's said that he had a face on the back of his head that would speak to him at night, whispering evil things to him as he would try to sleep. He eventually gave in to the torment and committed suicide. It's a chilling story, but I felt more grossed out than frightened by this film. If this is what this film's plot is based on, Wan has certainly come up with a very creative version of his own that turned out to be highly entertaining. I wouldn't give it a second viewing though.",Malignant

But alas, that wasn't the case and it was then I realised I had to sit in the cinema for 2 hours waiting for this to end and just hope it improved.It didn't.There is zero character development and so many characters that in the end I just didn't care about any of them. The main character Madison is just constantly looking sad, always looking like the victim but then can casually become empowered right at the end and lift a hospital bed no problem.The story itself, makes no sense. We start the film with a medical institution or whatever it is and then all of a sudden we are in the present day of what seems like a haunted house with no context or explanation. So, what am I watching here? Is it a haunting or is it a weird parasitic person growing out the back of your head.Quite important twists were met with horrific music choices and hilarious facial expressions. I couldn't take anything seriously. ""Sydney.... I'm adopted"" that's great Madison no one cares....The idea and twists were ok. Execution was horrific. I was neither scared or entertained.

1871,clohr-87826,Why Seattle?,4,11 September 2021,"As a long-time Seattle area resident, I'm still trying to understand why Seattle was the setting. Seattle is known for its rainy gray months, not thunderstorms. In fact, thunderstorms are relatively rare here. If the idea was to connect the electricity, then why not another location where t-storms are more prevalent? If it was to create a sense of dread, then just have consistent, unrelenting rain like in The Ring. In fact, at one point, there was a flyover shot of Seattle where you could clearly see that the clouds and rain were layered over a ""nice day"" in Seattle via computer magic-it just looked so fake. And, the Seattle Underground really didn't add much to the film either, so not sure removing that or finding another ""chase"" setting wouldn't have served just the same. Even shots of the main home and the streets didn't feel like Seattle. Streets are tight here and often hilly-this just looked like LA with occasional b-roll shots of Seattle.I do really appreciate Wan, and that's why I watched this film. I even ""slept on it"" to see if my POV changed. But, this one fell flat for me no matter how many times you tell me this is an homage to 80s slasher films or Italian horror.

Because of my love for horror movies, I will give this a second watch. I hope I was just not in the right frame of mind to watch it.Upon second viewing, I will update my review.",Malignant

1897,shakier-71897,MASTERPIECE,10,25 September 2021,"This movie i would consider a diamond in the dirt and the 'dirt' is actually the negative reviews people is giving it. I loved everything about this movie, whether it was the acting skills, storyline, uniqueness and simply how well everything was put together overall.",Malignant
1898,jluk-15233,A really good bad movie,6,28 September 2021,"This is my first review ever, and I was really on the fence about watching this movie after seeing all the fake 10/10 reviews and all the ""real"" 1/10 reviews, but I am glad that I did. I watch a lot of horror movies, and I've seen a lot of bad ones - it's rare to find a well made horror movie with small enough plot holes and an ending that leaves you satisfied. Although this does NOT fit in that category either, it was the first horror movie that I've watched that was so bad that it went full circle and became good. It is so ridiculous and over the top that you cannot help but laugh...my god, I laughed so hard. I can't wait to recommend and watch this ""horror"" film with friends and see their reactions as I cackle in the corner to their disbelief at what is happening.",Malignant
1899,iamhestbech,How this have got such a decent rating i don't know .,2,18 October 2021,"This is terrible. I Normally like James Wan, but this ... What a snooze. Too silly to be scary. Absolutely a waste of time in my humble opinion. The music is decent though.",Malignant
1900,greatwhites,Cheese B or C- movie?,3,19 September 2021,"Gathering the power of actors from failed toothpaste and constipation commercials, strange orchestral scores and California surfer/stoner writers this movie writhes on the ground and continues to disappoint.The acting is formatted in discomfortness and awkwardities. The story is based around costume designs that were left in a storage closet.It's a wonder how films like this get funding. Rich people are really bored with their money, maybe?It's like Wan was tired of taking cruises and drinking expensive organic lemonade and was inspired to make this film between sweeping and mopping his kitchen floor.",Malignant
1901,jordancknight-24234,Didn't see it coming...,7,27 September 2021,"The movie itself was okay, it was atypical Wann film. Had a good story and I didn't see the twist coming. The cinematography was AMAZING. Which is what bumped up my rating significantly.",Malignant
