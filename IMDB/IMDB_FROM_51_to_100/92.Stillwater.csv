0,SnoopyStyle,love first 2/3,6,1 September 2021,"Bill Baker (Matt Damon) is one of the struggling underclass living in Stillwater, Oklahoma. His oil rig job is gone and he's doing a lowly cleanup job after a tornado. He's respectful to everybody, has two guns, and prays before every meal. Money is tight. He was a bad absentee father but he travels to Marseille, France to visit his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin) who is in prison for murdering her girlfriend. She claims to be innocent. Bill has a suspect but no one is willing to help. He befriends a young girl named Maya and her mother Virginie (Camille Cottin) helps him as his translator.First, the elephant in the room is the complaint by Amanda Knox. She's entitled to her feelings and I'm sure that it feels bad to have other people take advantage of her story. While this story has some similarities, there are big differences from her story. In addition, this is the father's story more than the daughter's story. Amanda may feel exploited but at best, she is the starting inspiration for the writing of this story.The most compelling aspect is to make this MAGAian character as a sympathetic lead. The world is grinding him down but he still struggles on. He is Sisyphus. Their mantra becomes Life is Brutal. For the movie's first 2/3, his struggling to save his daughter is very compelling. His friendship with Maya is very sweet. The better way to wrap this up would be a sweet tragic turn with Maya. The turn it actually does is too convenient, too setup by the movie, and the movie had moved on. It clashes but I'm willing to live with it until the further twist comes. The twist is a real problem and it retroactively destroys some of the movie's first 2/3. Breslin would be acting differently and her explanation is a little light. It screws up an otherwise great movie.",Stillwater
1,boblipton,Under The Surface,7,7 August 2021,"Okie Matt Damon departs his home state, as he has before, to visit his daughter, Abigail Breslin, in prison is Marseilles for killing her lesbian Arabic lover. She says she didn't do it. He believes her, but during the trial he got drunk and punched out a British journalist, which didn't help Now she has a possible lead, but her defense attorney says it's too speculative to bring to the courts. So he stays to do some sleuthing on his own , and gets involved with actress Camille Cottin and her daughter, Lilou Siauvaud.THe two main strength in this movie are Damon's performance, which is as seething under a facade of Plains States good manners as I could imagine. Two thirds of his sides seem to be ""Yes, ma'am"", even while the audience can see his anger and despair and yes, self-loathing simmer, never quite raising the lid of the pot. The other is Masanobu Takayanagi's beautiful camerawork, whose color palette transforms the 3000-year-old city into a watercolor.",Stillwater
2,nogodnomasters,It's about finding peace,4,14 August 2021,"The film was inspired by the Amanda Knox saga, who was having a hissy fit before it was even released or she saw the film. Alison Baker is in jail in France for the murder of her Muslim girlfriend lover. Her Oklahoma oil worker dad, Matt Damon (Jason Bourne after he was kicked in the head by a mule) goes over to visit her and later does an investigation on his own.The film was boring.

4,CinemaSerf,Starts off well but peters out quickly...,6,15 September 2021,"It's an oddly constructed film this one. Matt Damon is pretty near the top of his game as the father who arrives in Marseille to help his imprisoned daughter - who has been accused of murdering her friend. Damon is very good in the role - an hard as nails father determined at all costs to seek justice. Somehow, though, his daughter ""Allison"" (Abigail Breslin) fails to engender one tiny bit of sympathy for her plight. I couldn't have cared less if she were never to see the light of day again - regardless of her innocence or otherwise. The film also flounders on a rather flawed premiss that somehow France is some romantic, fairy tale setting that ought not to be a match for this rough American. Anyone ever been to Marseille? It is as rough a place as exists anywhere, and has been for a very long time - so his difficulties are not only compounded, but the film loses a great deal of it's credibility. On the plus side, there is quite a delicate relationship demonstrated between him, ""Virginie"" (Camille Cottin) and her adorable little girl ""Maya"" (Lilou Siauvaud) but the ending is so weak, hurried and disappointing as to render the whole thing little better than a mystery in which nobody cares who did what to whom - and I suspect neither Stillwater nor Marseille would be overly impressed with the way the cities were shown here. A film for television, i'd say.",Stillwater
5,ferguson-6,oklahoma fish out of water,7,30 July 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's understandable if you are taken in by a trailer that hints at a movie featuring an unknown dad going non-stop in cold pursuit of justice for his daughter (those numerous Liam Neeson references were for my own pleasure). In fact, this father has his own particular set of skills: he's a master at carpentry and electrical, he speaks the Oklahoma version of English, and he owns two guns (neither of which he has with him). And yes, this film is billed as a crime thriller, but you should know, we see very little crime, and the thrills are mostly non-existent. Despite all that, I connected with the story, not as a thriller, but rather as a character study of a flawed man trying to do the right thing by his daughter and find redemption for himself.Oscar winner Matt Damon plays Bill Baker, a quiet out of work oil worker whom we first see on a clean-up crew after a disastrous tornado. Not long after, he's on an international flight to Marseille to visit his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin). She's been incarcerated for five years after being found guilty of stabbing her French-Arab lover, Lina, to death. In a highly publicized trial, Allison held fast to her claim of innocence, and still does. Her father visits regularly, delivering supplies and clean laundry. Although they hug on the visits, a definite chasm exists. We later learn that Bill previously struggled with drugs and alcohol and never received votes for Father of the Year. Allison asks her father to deliver a sealed letter to her attorney claiming there is new evidence in her case - she heard a guy named Akim had bragged at a party about committing Lina's murder.You likely noticed the similarities to the 2007 Amanda Knox case. The differences being that was Italy, this is France; and it was Amanda's roommate, not lover. In this movie, the media fascination is derived from the 'rich' entitled American white girl brutally murdering her minority working class lesbian lover (a textbook Hollywood rendering). Allison growing up poor in Oklahoma mattered little to the media.Damon plays Bill as a stoic, Heartland of America man who'll do anything for ""his little girl"". But he's no Jason Bourne. He's the proverbial fish-out-of-water on this mission. He doesn't speak a bit of French, and depends on the kindness of local actress Virginie (Camille Cottin, ALLIED, 2016) to be his interpreter and cultural guide in a world he doesn't comprehend. Bill quickly bonds with Virginie's precocious daughter Maya (a sterling film debut by Lilou Siauvaud), and soon a platonic family unit has formed. Bill's frequent prayers and odd American manners are the perfect cultural clash with Virginie's artsy French ways. Of course, this ultimately leads to a shift in the platonic nature of their relationship.The film is directed by Tom McCarthy, an Oscar winner for SPOTLIGHT (2015). I highly recommend two of his other films, the excellent THE VISITOR (2007), and his sinfully under-seen directorial debut THE STATION AGENT (2003). McCarthy co-wrote this script with Marcus Hinchey, Thomas Bidegain, and Noe Debre, which explains why the French details are so spot on. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi delivers brilliant camera work to go with the story's methodical pacing, and Mychael Danna's music adds intensity and depth to situations both quiet and fraught with emotion. Damon does some of his best work here as a man burdened with his own past and slowly becoming aware of possible personal and family life redemption. Ms. Breslin burst on the scene in 2006 with LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, and she has transitioned well to adult roles ... though this role is somewhat abbreviated, she still does nice work in her scene with Maya and Virginie.Bill and Virginie and Maya have some terrific segments together, including a dance to Sammi Smith's ""Help Me Make it Through the Night"". I'm guessing the rousing applause the film and actors received at Cannes was due partly to its French setting, and also to the depth of Bill's character (and Damon's performance). There are elements that seem far-fetched and maybe even overly complex, but viewed as the story of one man, it delivers some thought-provoking topics to the big screen. And yes, ""life is brutal"".Opens in Theaters Friday, July 30.",Stillwater
6,bombersflyup,"Good film, worthwhile.",8,20 August 2021,"Stillwater is an engaging and likable film in totality, without particular moments to highlight.From writer and director of 2003's ""The Station Agent,"" Tom McCarthy. Bill's daughter effectively damned him. He who couldn't be counted on, but changed his whole way of life for her and now home, no longer such. Damon toning down his performance in the role. The film isn't predictable at all as a whole, but the soccer match entirely so. He would obviously see the guy and be responsible for Maya at the same time, so not too creative there. One of the better films of the year though.",Stillwater
7,blanbrn,Search and journey for justice only it twist with discovery.,7,3 August 2021,"""Stillwater"" is one okay drama type suspense film of a father wanting to find out the truth with a case that involves his daughter. The film is a travel seek and find one that tries it's best to fight for justice, yet I for one felt the picture to be to long and in depth. Anyway Matt Damon is Bill a blue collar rural class working dad from Oklahoma who travels to France to look into a murder case that involves his daughter Allison(Abigail Breslin) a college exchange student. And Bill believes that his daughter has wrongly been accused and serving false prison time. The investigation and search seeking reveals people and clues only to twist and leave a viewer asking questions and thinking doubt. Along the way the film is spiced up some with Bill's intimate relationship with Virginie(Camille Cottin) a French stage actress. Overall nothing great still the movie tries to be long and in depth as it makes this an interesting mystery suspense type film that will leave the viewer still asking questions.",Stillwater
8,ops-52535,fails abit in ...,6,24 August 2021,"The end, and does have an uneccesary long plot and playtime to tell a short story. The main cast delivers very well, but the extras and support acts seems more amateuristic. Its more a drama than a thriller, and there are far too much dialouge than handy pandy action than youd expect from a matt damon movie, so just a 6 from the grumpy old man, and deserves the timefiller brand that would last 3.5 hours on a norwegian commercial channel...",Stillwater
9,Thanos_Alfie,Worth watching...,7,30 September 2021,"""Stillwater"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a father visiting her daughter in prison and starting searching for the truth about a murder her daughter claims that she didn't commit.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot from the beginning until the end of it and also contained some plot twists I did not expect. The interpretation of Matt Damon who played as Bill Baker was simply amazing and he made the difference in this movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Camille Cottin's who played as Virginie, Lilou Siauvaud's who played as Maya and Abigail Breslin's who played as Allison. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Stillwater"" is a breathtaking movie that will keep you in tense through its whole duration and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Stillwater

14,imseeg,"Slowburning, delicate portrait of a roughneck, who is desperate to proof the innocence of his daughter, accused of murder",7,28 August 2021,"Beware: all you Matt Damon action fans, this is NOTHING like his earlier action work, because this movie is quite a SUBTLE DRAMA situated in France. Basically it is a dramatic movie like the French are known for, with lots of attention for the characters and a slow build up of the story.This is a movie about family bonds, family love and how to repent ones sins of the past...
This is not a thriller. Not a detective either. It is a slowburning, delicate portrait of a roughneck (Matt Damon, oil driller / builder) who is desperate to proof the innocence of his daughter who has been accused of murder and is improsined in France.The bad: there are 2 very dramatic moments that are completely rushed, without any explanation. Very strange, but not that irritating, that it brings down the whole movie. The film is at moments quite slow. But never really becomes tedious, that is to say if you like a CHARACTER PORTRAIT. People without patience for character dramas shoudl avoid this movie...The good: acting is good. And I personally love the time this movie takes to let us viewers see HOW Matt Damon is slowly falling in love with a French woman.",Stillwater
15,paul-allaer,If you get the sense you've heard this story before but can't place it...,6,7 August 2021,"As ""Stillwater"" (2021 release; 140 min.) opens, we are introduced to Bill Baker, an erstwhile oil rig worker now in between jobs. Baker is flying into Marseille again, for a(nother) 2 week stay there to visit his daughter Allison, who has already spent 5 years in jail for the murder of her girlfriend. Allison swears she is innocent. Meanwhile Baker gets to know his neighbor in the hotel, Virginie and her 9 yr. Old daughter Maya. Virginie actually speaks English, so that is quite helpful. When Baker meets with Allison's lawyer, he gets the news no parent wants to get: the lawyer basically has given up, and Baker is on his own... At this point we are less than 15 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the first film from writer-director Tom McCarthy since his Oscar-winning ""Spotlight"" some 4-5 years ago. With a name like that attached to the film, not to mention the lead star Matt Damon, no slouch himself, I was intrigued by the film. Add Abigail ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Breslin as Allison, and you have all the necessary elements for a great movie. The movie's title ""Stillwater"" is quite misleading as in fact about 90% of the movie plays out in sprawling Marseilles. A critical scene in the movie plays out while the local soccer team Olympique Marseille plays a home game at the infamous Velodrome. It is clear that filming is done while an actual game is taking place, this is not staged, and hence adding to the authenticity of the scene. Alas, there are also some other aspects of the movie that do not work so well. Is this a ""will she get out of jail"" movie? Or is it more a troubled father-daughter relationship movie? Or perhaps yet something else? Also this: as soon as the movie started playing, it felt like I was familiar in a vague sense with this story, and hence I assumed that this was based on a true story. But nothing in the film credits acknowledges this. It didn't take me long afterwards to piece two and two together. The movie is in fact loosely based/a fictionalized version of the real life Amanda Knox story.""Stillwater"" was supposed to be released in theaters in Fall of 2020, but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. The movie finally was in theaters last weekend. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well, just 5 people (including myself). If you are a fan of Tom McCarthy or Matt Damon, or simply are in the mood for a complex if imperfect drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Stillwater
16,jtindahouse,Long and a little too simple,6,7 October 2021,"'Stillwater' has a very simple plot. When the film began I was getting 'Taken' vibes, but it was very different to that. The film is primarily a drama and very few others genres could really be argued. Crime and even thriller are a bit of stretch. The film is also very long. Very few modern films can justify a 2 hour 20 minute length. On this occasion it was bearable, but it certainly took away any chance of being re-watched.The acting is quite strong in this one. There are some pretty good characters at the heart of the movie which really helps to carry things, considering there is very little in the way of story for large portions of the film. Matt Damon's character is very understated and quiet, but he is also very likeable - largely in part to Damon's likability.The film is called 'Stillwater' and I'm not really sure why - very little of the film is actually set there. I also felt the ending was quite rushed, which is unforgivable when the film is as long as it is. This is a decent film that is watchable, but far from must-see material. 6/10.",Stillwater
17,stevendbeard,Not A Lot Of Action Here,6,2 August 2021,"I saw ""Stillwater"", starring Matt Damon-Ford v Ferrari, True Grit_2010; Camille Cottin-Call My Agent_tv, I Kissed a Girl; Abigail Breslin-the Zombieland movies, Signs and Lilou Siauvaud-this is her first movie.This movie is loosely based on the Amanda Knox story-I say loosely because I've heard that she is not too happy with it. Matt plays an Oklahoma oil 'roughneck' that travels to France to try to help his estranged daughter, Abigail. It seems that Abigail is in a French prison, accused of murdering a girl. She claims that she was framed but has been in prison for 5 years. Camille and her daughter, Lilou befriend Matt when he reaches France and try to help him in his quest for justice. Stillwater is the name of the town in Oklahoma that Matt is from. It's a study of how far a parent will go to help his daughter but it is not in the 'Bourne' or 'Taken' action genre-not a lot of action here, in fact, when someone asks Matt if he has a gun he says, 'Yeah, I have 2 of them, but I left them at home.'
It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't know if I would rent it, either but if you are interested in seeing it, I'd wait until it comes to cable.",Stillwater

STILLWATER is as hard-hat, in-you-face, blue-collar as GOOD WILL HUNTING. It deserves highest marks for warning Americans to stay out of the foreign regions that our President decreed to be ""S-hole"" nations, such as Italy, Greece and France. As deftly documented in STILLWATER, the latter failed country lacks the basics of Civilization, such as adequate room keys, working lights, flush toilets or a language that makes sense. Worse yet, these backwards societies go out of their way to railroad innocent Americans into tiny prison cells on trumped up murder charges at the drop of a hat. But even outside of such deplorable jails, the absolute squalor, soiled surroundings, crumbling edifices, claustrophobic confinement, musty milieu and mildewed furnishings depicted throughout this film cry out to all right-thinking U. S. Citizens to avoid France like the Plague!",Stillwater

20,masonfisk,NO MATTER WHAT...!,10,23 August 2021,"Tom McCarthy's (Spotlight/The Visitor) latest stars Oscar winner Matt Damon & Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin in this story of an American father's efforts to get his imprisoned daughter out of a French jail. Damon is definitely a ne'er do well, a former alcoholic working menial jobs to make ends meet, occasionally dining w/his oxygen machine assisted mother. We then see him pack & arrive in France for an extended stay to visit his daughter (she was convicted for killing her former lover after a public fight even though she maintains he innocence) & things start to heat up w/her case (she's served 5 years already) as word has it, the real killer had confessed in certain circles but tracking him down is an issue since he lives in a seemingly untouchable housing project. Damon hoping to make things right (since Breslin's lawyer, played by Anne Le Ny, from The Intouchables, has backed away from the new evidence claiming it heresay) decides to play private eye w/the help of a mother/daughter (played by Camille Cottin/Lilou Siauvaud) team he met at a communal hostel who he ends up staying with (being an ace handyman & his burgeoning relationship w/the daughter) but after a disastrous run-in w/some housing residents (where he's beaten up) after tracking down the wanted party some time passes & in a freak encounter after a soccer game w/the daughter, Damon sees his man & things turn for the good but do they?

A real slow burner and that's not a criticism in any way .Matt Damon plays a father who travels from Oklahoma to France to help his estranged daughter, who is in prison for a murder she claims she didn't commit.This isn't really a film about a murder .It's a movie about someone trying to do the right thing and making mistakes along the way.It's a love story .

Tom McCarthy's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed and extremely well paced. The music by Mychael Danna is excellent.",Stillwater
24,rgkarim,"This Water Is More Dramatic and would be a 9 on that elements, but Thriller/Crime is Not Much This Time",8,31 July 2021,"LIKES:The Pacing:
For a drama, Stillwater moves rather well given the directions it takes with the story. A bit slow at the beginning, the director and writers accomplished the task of setting up the events and characters and piecing things together very well for the long game to come. It's not the most engaging thriller pace, but certainly remains entertaining as Damon's character Bill searches for the answers. That pacing remains throughout much of the movie and again remains engaging throughout the tale for me.The Mystery Element:
For a thriller, you are always looking for the truth and figuring out what lies amongst the shadows of deceit. While a bit unorthodox in this film, the underlying truth is part of the reel of the film, and finding those answers is part of the fun of the film. The first act alone is primarily about this, and seeing the lengths that Bill takes is both heartwarming and bold to see what repercussions would arise.The Relationship components: The biggest element of the film is more on the drama side and the relationships that develop over the course of the film. Bill's interactions gradually evolve over the course of the two hours, roping in several people in his pursuit of the truth that quickly turns into the theme of a new life emerging from the old. His interactions with Maya, Virginie, the Detective, and his daughter are very expansive, an emotional spectrum that is not only realistic, but interesting at the same time to see how these relationships unfold. Stillwater does a great job with the character utilization, ensuring that every big introduction contributed to the story in some way shape or form (perhaps not in the fullest amount, but still contributing well). If you are looking for a movie with these relationship components, then this is going to be the film for you.Translations:
I love when a film decides to present the beauty and culture of a country and make a strong point of the story. Stillwater shows the culture of the French, and does it with class, realism, and neither glorifying nor degrading with politics, at least too much. I loved seeing Bill navigate the struggles of a foreign country, how he required assistance and then seeing that culture come out to block his pursuit of the information was a realistic notion I liked. It did not feel like too much suspense of disbelief, and even better became a natural part of his life as expected of one moving to a new country. Yet, the biggest thing I loved weas when they decided to use the French language we got translations that were consistent and not selective as some studios decide to do. That consistency allows you to understand what is going on, and keep you ingrained into the lives of the characters and that's a big plus in my book.The Acting:
The cornerstone of the movie is the acting performances that come with our cavalcade of ordinary beings. Damon himself is set up for a much deeper role than what I've seen in a while, with a rugged outlook on life that gradually gives way to a complex soul with a lot to offer. Seeing his transition over the course of the movie may not be the most unique experience, but it is miles above his other recent work in seeing an inspiring character who does not necessarily change his core, but rather his actions. His chemistry with all the characters is great, and the direction on how to make each relationship was fantastic in regards to making this patched together family atmosphere work on many accounts. Camille Cottin was superb in her role, a fantastic blend of European and American cinema that culminated into a very engaging character for Bill to primarily interact with. Recruited as an awkward interpreter, the dynamic that she brings in her interactions offers some evolution pressure that affects her as well. Seeing her involvement change in Bill's life was one of my favorite parts of this film, and I loved the theatrics she brought in the more dramatic moments that added that European culture found in their movies. As for Breslin, the girl continues to wow me with how far she has come since her childhood star days. This role has got vim and vigor, hope and complexity, but not to the point of being too out of her comfort zone to be portrayed extreme. Allison's life has a lot to it and seeing the moments with her was that sort of moral checkpoint that always ushered in the next chapter of this story that was sort of the changing tide of the piece. Finally young actress Lilou Siauvaud is another prime example of how a child performance can be handled without being annoying or over the top. Another character with a lot of layers, the 9 year old offers a childlike wonder that makes life exciting, but still have enough maturity to stay grounded, she was another major part of my enjoyment of the film. I found her chemistry with everyone quite impressive, and her ability to make those emotions in the dialogue come out sensational.DISLIKES:The Accuracy Component:
When you say based on real life events, hopefully you have a guard up about how accurate this film is to the real life events. Stillwater is nothing like the case I read, and only has an inkling of similarities to what happened in this case. If you go in here, expecting an exact match... well you are out of luck and may be disappointed as I've seen some reviewers stay.Some Suspense f Disbelief:
Primarily in how quickly the nature of interactions go and how quickly Vriginie agrees to do things either shows one heck of a great Samaritan or a rather convenient plot outing. Stillwater's convenience factor is a little tuned to high in how things sort of fall into place, but not to the point of ridiculous like we've seen in other franchises. A minor dislike and one that was hard to draw without going back and really diving in, those with the sensitivity to picking up these moments may find their eyes rolling a bit more.It's not really a Thriller:
The first act of the film was geared to exactly what the trailers promised, a mystery and attempt to piece evidence together to accomplish a goal. Those moments are well thought out and again placed a little more in reality than say C. S. I. Or other television dramas, and your mind is trying to find the answers. But then Act 2 and Act 3 come up and suddenly, the tale is an entire new ball game that makes this movie more drama than anything else. While certainly a well done drama, this derailing from the mystery is a major diversion from what one might go into from seeing the trailers and as I've seen tick off a lot of movie goers. What's worse is instead of sticking with that tangent, the movie then tries to throw that original thriller back into the mix. While it helps spice up the drama aspect, challenging what acts 2 and 3 were building, the inclusion so late in the film made it almost too late to really bring that mystery element back in and I kind of would have liked it to stay away given how much I was enjoying the tangent. It's the ending that really made this clear though, and speaking of which...The Ending:
Stillwater did so much to keep me invested in the movie, looking towards a nice ending that was going to put a nice pin in the story to say it was done. Well... we kind of got that. That mystery element brought back in act 4 does get the solution, one with a twist that was okay for me, but at least gets that element mostly closed. However, the last ten minutes of the film sort of felt extraordinarily crammed together and leaves on a simple dialogue that offers little to me despite the realism it has. You may like the artistic representation it has, which I can't say to avoid spoilers, but for guys like me a little more would have been nice, even if it was just a few still shots of words to close the story.The VERDICT:
Stillwater is a slower movie that does not feel slow, and certainly a fun relation movie that holds deeper levels of character involvement than most films. Damon and his crew are the stars of this film and make so much of it come to life, that I felt a part of their lives during the running of this show. They made the dialog come to life, they immerse you into their character roles and they keep things moving and not just stagnant as some dramas choose to do. This film is indeed a wonderful blend of European and American cinema and again has me excited for what is to come if the two worlds continue to meet. However, the movie is not a thriller as the trailers have painted, and though there is some mystery to it, it's not the selling point for this film. In addition the ending does not really do the mystery any justice for me and I unfortunately was left bored and annoyed with the compressed ending we got. Still, overall this movie is worthy of viewing knowing what is in store, and I would say given the acting premise it could be a theater trip if looking for something. Otherwise check this one out when you get a home viewing.My scores are:Crime/Drama/Thriller; 8.0 if looking at Drama/Crime
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Stillwater
25,vengeance20,Not The Greatest,4,9 August 2021,"Seen this tonight after seeing some brief previews & reading about the film, which sounded like it would be good! It wasn't great!The film follows a southwestern father, Bill Baker, who tries to help get his estranged daughter Allison, who is wrongfully accused of murdering her girlfriend in France. It is then that Bill makes it his mission to help get his daughter out of prison & bring the perpetrator to justice. But language & cultural barriers make it harder for him to get somewhere.I found the film to be slow, yes I know it's a slow burner, but I only guessed that in the cinema & got it confirmed before writing this review. But it was too slow in itself & I didn't help that there were a lot of scenes which forgot the plot & overall, didn't add anything & slowed the film down! A good 40-50 minutes could've been cut out of the film & should've focused on the plot more as the scenes that didn't add to anything, weren't adding to the main story & just frustrated me as I was wanting the film to progress!The love story part was good & to be fair, the relationship scenes with Bill & the single mum, Virginie & her daughter Maya were great also, but could've been shorten down as these scenes & other strayed too far away from the films plot which at a lot of points in the film, were almost completely forgotten. The charter of Allison was moody, gobby, arsey, chippy, hypocritical & very ungrateful. I didn't like her at all & should've shown her father more appreciation for going as far as getting the crap beaten out of him.While I was engaged in the film for 2 hours & 12 minutes, I still felt that the pacing & runtime could've been improved as I did find it was dragging on. The end part was sad & somewhat unclear, we never find out what happens to the man Bill kidnapped & we never find out if he ever contacted Virginie & Maya again as I wanted some conclusion to that story arc.There was some interesting moments in the film & like I said, I was engaged, but it did start to lose its way a lot in the film especially near the end. There were some great moments & a lot of sad ones.Overall, the pacing & runtime on this film is bad & for such a simple plot, it should've been shorter as there were a lot of scenes which held up & forgot the main plot of the film. However, there was a good amount of scenes which did keep you engaged until it neared the end. The end in itself which sucked.4/10.",Stillwater
26,nancyldraper,A good movie,7,11 August 2021,"Full disclosure, I think Matt Damon is one of the most undervalued actors in the business. Just look at his range of performances - the butt of the joke in OCEANS, a man reduced in DOWNSIZING, a meticulous and idealistic car designer in FORD V FERRARI, an action star in the BOURNE franchise, and now, a redneck American trying to make good for his daughter in a foreign world. Matt Damon is a good actor. This is a good movie. The acting is right on it's mark. The tone is gritty. The pace is heartfelt but real. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Drama}",Stillwater
27,martimusross,A Damage Man Tries To Save His Damaged Family,7,7 August 2021,"StillwaterI really enjoyed this movie, yes there were some clunky moments, even some ridiculous contrivances, but on the whole it worked and Matt Damon delivered in spades a character, that on the face of it, was a deeply damaged and likeable hero!Stillwater, being the town, the company and Matt Damon, was to my mind a silly title, perhaps troubled waters would have been better.Bill, was a father and son, he was both socially and emotionally stunted hiding behind a mask of masculinity and politeness. Out of his depth in the French slum that is Marseilles he tried to undertake a private investigation, I told you the script was clunky!Ali, the murderous daughter, played by Abigail Breslin, either overworked or was misdirected, I go for the former, note to self ""never attempt to upstage the hero!"" We had little sympathy for her so why should we care as to whether she was released or confined after having already served 5 years of an 8 year sentence.The ending was rubbish and was unsatisfactory but hey the rest was good.Overall it's a 7 outta 10, well worth watching and quite thought provoking!",Stillwater
28,NijazBaBs,emotional and realistic,6,9 September 2021,"This is not one of those extreme or regular thrillers or actions. This is more natural, realistic, subjective movie. Meaning all reactions and behaviors are similar to my personal from ordinary life, there is presence of religion, emotions, relationships. Matt can be compared to Liam Neeson and his latest movie The Marksman (2021). Both Matt and Liam play good role of ordinary man with ordinary, sometimes bit extreme troubles. It's interesting to watch them struggle with ordinary problems in ordinary fashion. Many scenes reminds me of personal life scenes around me. Actors looks authentic. Emotions are mature, spiritual, religious, philosophical, something I associate with growing up.",Stillwater
29,dtucker86,Overall a good movie but depressing,6,28 August 2021,"One of my biggest complaints with films as of late isn't the violence and foul language (althought there is PLENTY of that) its that so many show characters that are very unlikeable. This movie is a case in point. Matt Damon gives a wonderful performance as a flawed but basically decent man who tries to prove his imprisoned daughter innocent. The thing is that you really don't care about his daughter because she is such an unlikeable little brat. There is a scene where she curses him out that made me cringe, I wanted him to slap her! The best part of the movie is the wonderful love story that develops between Damon and that French woman and her little girl. It is so touching but in the end sad when it just wasn't meant to be.",Stillwater

I just really felt for everyone in this movie and I thought the thing moved really well, I actually loved every minute of it cause of the writing was really on point, I just felt like the characters came to life and it moved on its own i know the thing is a true story and that adds flavour but I really thought as a stand alone character study that it really encapsulates a broad scope into our human condition. I also felt at the end as though I was happy to have ol' girl back home with her daddy but at but I also had mixed feelings about her involvement and the quaint cute lil' family he left behind! It was all very interesting founded on a very intriguing idea! Great job!",Stillwater
31,Vivekmaru45,A slow-burn drama but entertaining enough to watch through to the end.,6,26 August 2021,"Let me start by stating that I'm not big fan of Matt Damon. Same goes with Mark Wahlberg. Indeed these two are so similar with a beard that they might be mistaken for twins or brothers.This movie is about a father who travels to another country to find out how is daughter is doing. I will not say anything more - it's a family drama in some sense of the word. Nor is this movie a thriller but it has a watered down element of one. The film is decently paced, and there are no heat-stopping thrills or chills.The acting by Damon is adequate but he is not, nor will ever be an Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt or a Laurence Olivier. I don't think that he came out of a drama school where he worked in a theater for at least eight or ten years. You see these younger generation of actors don't have any theater experience and are thrust directly into movie and they fail to make an impact.The acting of all in this film is stereotypical and you might even say all these actors are stereotypes. These days all that Hollywood needs is an excuse to make a movie.Tom McCarthy makes no blunders in direction but the plot of the film could have been better. The sound-effects and photography is top-notch as with most good movies. If you have time to spare, then of course this is decent entertainment.",Stillwater
32,bob-the-movie-man,"""Life is Brutal""",8,10 August 2021,"Positives:
Matt Damon needs to be the rock at the centre of the movie to hold it all together. The movie lives or dies on believing that he could be a God-fearing oil roughneck and all-round f-up. And he does a really good job here in doing that.The script excels in a number of ways:-- it's great in building, and in some cases destroying, the relationships between the characters. In particular, the portrayal of the pseudo-family that develops with Bill, Virginie and Maya is very sweet. A lounge scene, without dialogue, with each looking in turn at each other is glorious;
-- the story isn't handed to you on a plate, but your understanding of what's going on evolves as you watch it;
-- a twist in the story (no spoilers) is unexpected and savage, and requires real concentration to understand!Negatives:
Although I appreciated the leisurely introduction of the characters and their relationships, the film was a bit flabby in the telling. At nearly 140 minutes, I think its about 20 minutes too long.For balance and a different view, the wife was very upset and cross about the treatment of Maya at one point in the movie. (There are clear repercussions though). And she wasn't a fan of Abigail ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Breslin's performance (although I personally though it was ""OK"").Summary Thoughts on ""Stillwater"": It's billed as a ""Thriller"" and although it does have it's moments of tension, it's much more a drama reflecting a flawed father trying to make amends for his failures in the past. As such it might plod a bit for those looking for more of an action-oriented thriller. But I found it thoroughly absorbing overall, and a marked improvement on ""Spotlight"" by the same director (which seemed to garner praise and Oscar nods from everyone other than me!).A curiosity for me is the rating for this one.... a ""15"" certificate in the UK for ""Strong Language"". I'd assumed that the ""15"" rating was due to the racist dialogue, present in one particular brief scene. But that seems to be a secondary concern to the BBFC (see their web site). I'm sure they have word-tally counts. But, to me, there wasn't enough bad language in this one to merit the rating: I personally think it should have been a ""12A"".But overall this is a solid piece of movie story telling, whether controversial or otherwise.

33,Movi3DO,Good story but could be more impactful,8,1 August 2021,"Ah and another movie that Jimmy Kimmel would never watch.A drama where Matt Damon as a father, flew to Marseille to bring justice for his daughter, who was wrongly accused of a murder, while meeting people that would help him.With the runtime of almost 2 and a half hours, I was surprisingly engaged throughout the whole movie. The first half was enjoyable where Matt Damon lived with a new family in Marseille, and it was sweet to see the character dynamic. There were also some funny scenes and conversations that made their relationship even more investing. The main crime story with the father and daughter was also pretty good, and again I was invested to see how it would turn out.Matt Damon was again good in his role. He captured the sad father character who went through a lot of bad things in life.However, for the story and theme, many elements were seen before. This made the story fairly predictable. Also, there was a theme about life and how brutal it was. I don't think they hit this theme well. I wouldn't even see this as the main theme, if not for the characters actually saying it out loud.Overall, still a good story that I was invested in, but the themes could have been more impactful. 7.5/10.",Stillwater
34,Neptune165,It takes it's time and lets you care about the characters,5,17 September 2021,"He was working odd jobs, was not grounded to anyone, and was not in control. He was bounced around by life. That is why the second act felt more centered and better paced. He was settling into a new part of his life. He was wanted and accepted and had mostly made peace with himself. He was grounded. The third act felt hectic but not in like a meandering way like the first act. The third act was him trying to hold on to what he had but also accomplish his original goal. And yeah you could have shaved some but I think the extra time spent really helped make for very fleshed out characters. I don't appreciate them hijacking Amanda Knox's story. The woman deserves some peace. Thought it was a solid movie
But the film wasn't better than spotlight.",Stillwater
35,Alexander_Blanchett,Damon was fantastic - hoped for a better ending,8,13 September 2021,"I liked it a lot. Its one of those kind of old fashioned films that are really rare these days. Character focused thriller drama with real individuals and where the characters are more in focus than the story.I loved Matt Damon in this. Its one of his best performances in years and he really nailed it from the first to the last minute. He was soaked into this character that I never had the impression to see Damon on screen. Its not only his physical change, but the whole way he acted that role. It was just fantastic. I dont think he will have many chances during awards season but as of now he certainly should be a top candidate.Another surprising turn came from Abigail Breslin. To be very honest, besides Little Miss Sunshine I was never really impressed by her. Especially not in her grown up roles. This was a major change. She really turned into a wonderful performance. Very heartwretching moments and she gives her character a lot of soul and makes it totally real. Breslin got more out of it than there was on paper. I also liked Camille Cotin and the young lady who played her daughter. Great ensemble with a truly fantastic lead.The screenplay was decent enough, but it were the actors that made this film a piece of quality. Nice score, good direction round it up to one of the best films I have seen so far this year. The only issue I had was the ending. Some storylines felt kind of unfinished and generally very rushed. I think ten more minutes would have done the film better.",Stillwater

37,statuskuo,Still Waters Runs Deep,8,5 August 2021,"This movie let me practice some of my French as I felt a little like my boy Matt Damon here.A simple quiet man who embodies the saying ""still waters run deep"" It is loosely based on the international scandal of Amanda Knox who, as you may have read, was accused of murdering her exchange student roommate, convicted THEN released.Any way, it is an engaging film anchored by a very understated Damon who plays the father of j'accused. Here, he integrates himself Marsaille society and learns to care for people. I mean, people he isn't related to.There are moments that seem...shoehorned for dramatic effect such as the fact that his daughter would be spending 10 years on a murder, and she's only done 5, doesn't want to spend the next 5 in prison even though she gets leave and...SPOILER...she actually was responsible for the death of her lover/roommate.BUT, on the whole, it is a movie that gets beyond an episode of ""Locked-Up Abroad"" (literally, she is a locked up broad) as he wants to reconnect with a distant, entitled daughter who seems desperate to get her Dad's attention. Or rather see a bigger world outside dusty Oklahoma. And who could blame her. France is full of life. Full of living. And is populated by people who are helpful kind people like Virginie played marvelously by Camille Copying. She is a single mother who struggles to rebuild her life but also seems like a woman who doesn't allow darkness to invade her life. On the other hand Bill (Damon) allows his past to keep him rooted in menial labor whose only outlet appears to be breaking things or hauling things to circumvent feelings. Honest portrayal of these people.Eventually Bill opens up a little to the world and sees that itis the people who make living less miserable.Perhaps you will get this message maybe not. Either way...I love the complexity of humans just being human. And there is nothing more substantial than that. A Intricate Story Of A Deceptively Simple Man.",Stillwater
38,davidgee,Small movie on a big theme,8,12 August 2021,"The story seems to draw on the case of the American student convicted of a murder in Italy some years ago. Damon, beefed up and bearded, sheds all his usual glamour and fully disappears into the role of the father doggedly trying to prove his daughter's innocence and ""adopting"" a second child along the way. There's a plot twist which slightly stretches credibility, but the ending is gratifyingly unsentimental. A small movie on a big theme and a cast who are all emotionally engaging and utterly believable.",Stillwater

It's probably best Matt Damon's acting class in a long time.Second, the characters building are pretty good and solid.

I lived several funny situations too, mostly in Texas. Great memories.Last, the script and storyline are simply great. Some little plot holes here and there, but still an amazing work in all aspects.To add, filming locations were great. Marseille and Stillwater were the perfect combination for filming this drama.So, ovearall an excellent piece of cinema that includes beautiful bittersweet stories between the characters, great characters building and amazing cinematography.

42,MovieCriticOnline,One of the better films in a while..,7,24 September 2021,"One of the better films I've seen in a while. But not surprisingly since Tom McCarthy approaches his filmmaking very realistically and honestly, which means the writing and acting seem real and genuine. It's a very documentary feel to movie making which is always the best. There is obviously a resemblance to the Amanda Knox case admitted by the director. Also, they certainly captured France well so kudos for that.So refreshing to see honest filmmaking and I mean not necessarily that it didn't have flaws because it certainly did, but that it is honest filmmaking.I was honestly expecting some stereotypical bashing of ""red-necks,"" mainly from interviews that were circulating prior to the release of the movie. Well, apparently some of it leaked into the film, which was totally unnecessary. Less political partisan undercurrents would have made it better. I don't mind politics in movies if they are fair and honest and not used to push agendas and political sides. There was clearly an attempt, albeit small, to frown the nose at people that vote other than for democrats.My small criticisms were that maybe Damon played the part a bit too on the nose and that the story of a single dad meeting the single mom has been done too many times. Also, Abigail's performance lacked some authenticity. It was a bit too forced and lacked focus and why didn't she have an Oklahoman accent? Minor things.My bigger criticisms were that it reminded me a bit of Prisoners, which was the part I didn't like. That made the film weaker and I wish it didn't go in that direction. There were other ways of resolving the daughter's murder conviction.In fact, it was irritating the way they turned things around. They had a chance to turn something bad into something nice, and they messed it up by forcing the drama toward the end. I was praying the movie didn't have a bad ending, but it did. What could have been an original film turned into a mix of Prisoners and Presumed Innocent. Virginie and Maya were the best things in the film and they didn't pursue it the way it should have been pursued. The relationship with his daughter was almost a footnote in the film since they spent very little time with it, but yet it ended up being used to end it. It felt like two competing storylines and they didn't merge or connect them in a good way.Overall, I liked it, and kudos to honest filmmaking. Just wish they didn't take it in the direction they did. It went from a 8-9 rating to a 6-7 for me because of that.In summary, the approach to the film, in terms of acting, writing and direction was good. The story however was a bit of a mess that lacked focus and added unnecessary suspense and thrill at the end that felt out of place for the rest of the film, just for the sake of commercializing the film and the underhanded jabs at middle America were unwarranted.",Stillwater

48,movieman6-413-929510,"Father tries to rescue daughter from France, only in a more long-winded way.",5,21 August 2021,"Stillwater is a new crime drama directed in part written and produced by Spotlight director Tom McCarthy.In the film, Bill Baker (Matt Damon) travels from Oklahoma to Marseille to visit his daughter Alison (Abigail Breslin) in prison. She is incarcerated as the prime suspect in a murder case, but claims to be innocent. Bill decides against her will to prove her innocence, but for this he is confronted by a language barrier and cultural differences. Despite these obstacles, Bill tries to do everything he can to prove Alison's innocence and find the real culprit.Instead of a CIA agent, in this film, an American redneck goes to France to try to save his daughter. This way you get more of a crime drama than a crime action movie. Despite the fact that the film is promoted a bit too much as an action film, the main character does more research than he really fights with enemy French.In contrast to his Oscar-winning film Spotlight, Tom McCarthy also chooses to have only one character researched. These choices quickly transform the film's story into a predictable and tedious standard detective crime film where the main character travels from place to place to find evidence, but many places are otherwise of little importance. The script writers should have kept many of these unnecessary journeys out of the film and only bring out the more important things. The film would then have been shorter with a better tempo.The film also doesn't really have a clear start, because in the beginning of the film too much has already happened with the daughter without you getting to see this story aspect. They also choose not to portray other aspects of the story, which can give the viewer the feeling that something is missing when the film is finished.This film is also loosely based on the true story of Amanda Knox, who disagreed that they used her name and story for this film without deliberation.Regardless of the story, Tom McCarthy and photography director Masanobu Takayanagi manage to portray the film beautifully. In this way they convey the different cultures from Marseille well.The acting is well done by the film cast. Matt Damon has played more minor roles in movies or had some cameos since 2015. With this role, he seems to be trying again to come back as a lead actor in a movie. Apart from the lesser script, he does come across as an American redneck, who tries to do everything in his own way. Together with Abigail Breslin, they come across as a father and daughter who have become estranged from each other. The film only misses moments to show that their relationship is back to normal.In the film, Matt Damon has better chemistry with French Virginie (Camille Cottin), who tries to help him along with her young daughter Maya (Lilou Siauvaud). Because this chemistry is more apparent, the chemistry between father and daughter is somewhat overshadowed. For Lilou Siauvaud this was only her first film role, which she manages to portray in a good and appropriate way.",Stillwater

Anchored by a sensational Matt Damon, this journey of a father to find justice for his wrongfully convicted teenage daughter will resonate with everyone.Based on a real life incident where Amanda Knox, a US student in Italy was wrongfully imprisoned over a murder case, the mercurial Abigail Breslin plays the character with élan, belying her tender age.Damon fully throws himself into the character, of a roughneck oil rig worker who tried to redeem himself as a deadbeat dad and finally come through for his daughter. The obstacles he faces in acclimatizing to a new country and culture is captured with tenderness and authenticity.Camille Cottin and child actor Lilou Siauvaud are superb in their supporting roles and the scenes between the young girl and Damon provide some of the best moments in the film.The film ultimately shows that a father will go to any lengths for their baby girl and Breslin and Damon deliver in portraying that bond in a convincing manner to the audiences.A real-life story of a father's quest to free his daughter, told with reverence and impact by the talented Tom McCarthy. Cant wait to see what he comes up with next.Highly recommended!",Stillwater

Structured differently than one would think, the film goes at a pretty steady pace towards its melancholic destination.In one of Matt Damon's better performances, for which he dons a goatee that I couldn't stop looking at, he wrestles with the themes of acceptance and altering your life path.Even with its enjoyable oddities, the film does have some shaggy moments be trimmed from the 140-minute runtime.

4) I was really engaged by the relationship between Bill and Maya, it was very heartwarmingNEGATIVES:1) The film definitely has pacing issues; it felt very long and it was as though some scenes dragged out for far too long whereas others were sped through far too quickly
2) All of the main characters said or did things at one point or another that made them unlikable

But he still has to pay bills, and so we have Stillwater.Of course, as most everyone has noticed, this is a retelling of the sordid Amanda Fox case.The first question that comes to mind is: Does this case need to be retold or adapted? I guess not since the real Amanda seems to be your typical hysterical nutjob American woman, a very strange woman indeed.Second question: Why the revisionism? Why a lesbian having an affair with a Muslim woman? Well, we all know that being woke is fashionable, so the woker the better.

There is a little girl, the Maya character (Lilou Siauvaud, who steals every scene she is in along with her mother), and is by far the most interesting person in this banal drama. Add to this debacle of film-making and buterched story-telling is the thinly veiled and insidiously exploitive references to the Amada Knox saga of Italy and you have a pretentious, unlikely, but well-acted tale of complete nonsense.

Don't expect too much from this film because there is not very much on offer; except Matt & Lilou!It runs for 2 hours 19 minutes which is just way too long for this tail dragging non thrilling thriller; a 1hr:30 minute length would have been more than enough for this story. Another thing that was very annoying was the mumbled diction here and there (something which seems to be happening a great deal in American films of late...even when I replay the words in a scene 3 or 4 times, they are to quietly mumbled/muffled to understand what is said).Not a film that I will be adding to my collection of Matt Damon DVD's as by the end of it I had to wonder why it was worth making (even if Matt and Lilou made 15-20 minutes of on screen time together very worth seeing).There are bits here and there that are peppered with racism (the Arab immigrants, and their offspring, are not liked at all by a great deal of French people) but its actually about a 1,000 times worse.

I always enjoy stories about people in difficult life situations who are trying to find their way. Having dealt with a family member who is always in trouble, I could relate to the characters in this story.There were many excellent performances in this film. The story was solid. I even found the timing to be adequate (despite the film being as long as it was).If you do not like character dramas, skip this film. If you didn't like Lost in Translation, skip this film.I took 1 point away for starting down the identity politics path (which quickly disappeared as the story developed its groove in focusing on ""people"").

Breslin is excellent, of course.Some things strike me as overtly woke in this, but that's to be expected these days. The female romantic lead isn't particularly attractive, for one. And there's the ever-present left leaning Hollywood political stance that manifests in digs and commentary here and there.Honestly, the best part of this are scenes between Damon and Breslin.

72,fraser-simons,interesting Ideas With Poor Follow Through,6,19 August 2021,"There is much more emotional intelligence than I expected from it, but it also, almost comically so, reframes the entire story. From the trailer I had expected this to be perhaps a slow thriller. But it's more of a straight drama.Damon initially runs around attempting to find a witness in a very bull-in-China-shop-kind-of-way. And actually, this is when the most interesting elements of it are established. The interplay of cultural dynamics and light ribbing of Americana and tourism and conservatism makes for a unique frame for this kind of story. Especially because we see that he's highly ineffective.But the real story isn't about the daughter, the victim, it's Bill's story about the way in which he loves his daughter, in his very particular way, and the lengths to which he goes to try and save her. He's emotionally crippled yet forms a relationship with a mother and child, yet has to, ostensibly, choose between the two.And that is where the movie falls apart somewhat. He attempts to corral this tension of Bills choice and the consequences therein. But the problem is, I don't actually think that's a more interesting story than the expectations people will have from the trailer - where he is searching for the truth and retracing events, navigating the foreign.Instead, it's very simply Bill making poor decisions that jeopardize interpersonal relationships and literally nothing else. If the emotion was more there - or there was some more duality than a single decision, really-maybe it could have worked? Instead the whole thing feels flaccid. And it's. A bit strange to choose that character to center the story on as well. It's certainly different... but to little effect, I'm afraid.",Stillwater

Refreshing to see Matt Damon in a completely new avatar where he sheds his glamour side and fully embraces his age.Initially you get the feel, whether if this is a typical American exceptionalism film where a do-all-good protagonist goes to a foreign country and fights against evil people (Arabs in France, how convenient!) to save his innocent daughter. While there are some very negative portrayals of poor immigrant communities in France, the film attempts to provide some social justice from the character Virginie.The biggest plus of the film is that the chemistry between the lead actors is very good, special shoutout to Lilou Siauvaud whose portrayal of Maya is simply sensational. Really liked the way how the film becomes a family drama in the middle before going back to its original roots in the last 30 minutes. It's a shame that Tom McCarthy didn't realise that some parts of his film are filled with negative and problematic stereotypes.Stillwater is certainly a film which will not satisfy everyone and will leave a lot of mixed opinions but it's good to see something that's a different attempt from what we have seen usually.",Stillwater

Everyone did a good job but in short it's that kind of movies that you only watch for the star and everyone else is mediocre or a miscast led by the slow story with it's weak characters and plot holes.

Matt Damon played the part well as did Maya and the love interest. However it's a slow boring film with many loose ends at the finish line.Firstly Amanda was gorgeous why cast an unattractive Abigail to play her? She isn't a foxy knoxy and at first I thought it was Debbie from Shameless. They should have stuck to the story, that it was the flatmate murdered and started off showing the murder and court hearing or at least the sentencing and then at the end show us what really happened.Matt should have stayed in France with his new found family and left that brat inside jail.I was so disappointed I spent over two hours watching this.Matt did a great job as the blue collar typical American man.

This, right here, is the movie's weakest link: Abigail Breslin is completely unsympathetic as the daughter Allison. When you should be rooting for our hero to succeed in his mission, you really don't care one little bit whether she rots in prison or not. Conversely, Bill's relationship with local woman Virginie and her adorable daughter Maya is when this movie is at its best. Their Franco-American culture clashes also provide all of the humour. I also liked how no effort whatsoever was made to show either Marseille or Stillwater in a good light. Both are portrayed as gritty, shabby and uninviting.

83,Mike_O_Dwyer,A Mixed Bag of Missed Opportunities,6,25 August 2021,"While similar in some respects to the Amanda Knox case, Stillwater is told from a father's point of view after his daughter has been convicted of a crime she may or may not have committed in a foreign land.Sadly this in not Damon's best. It's hard to buy him as a roughneck, the polite surface manner is there but the burly physique built up from years of rigging and construction feel to slight no matter how wide he splays his arms and puffs his chest.Matt Damon plays Bill, a hardworking midwestern grafter from Stillwater, Oklahoma, who commutes to Marseille to visit his daughter, Allison (Abigal Breslin), in prison. About halfway through her sentence Abigal receives a lead which may help exonerate her, but her french lawyer tells Bill the judge will not reopen a case based on hearsay, there must be new evidence.And so begins Bill's fish out of water experience of following up the lead in a country where he can't speak the language, and one in which he has no idea how to navigate culturally. How can a roughneck from middle America, who has probably never strayed more than a state from his home, piece together hints and threads that lead him into a diverse world that cares not a jot for this American.Camille Cottin, the star of 'Call My Agent', befriends Bill and he comes to rely on her and her daughter. Stillwater actually works best here, the coming together of these three is entirely watchable and unfolds quietly, naturally. Bill's brash naivete allows him to fail onwards if not upwards, he might get knocked back but he keeps picking himself up and over time he adjusts to his new environment and makes a new life for himself with Virginie and Maya.Unfortunately the plot requires that leads must be followed and some sort of resolution reached. If pushed, I suspect that most people could fill in the blanks as the final act plays out.Stillwater feels like two films trying to play out side by side: an all American can-do hero will not be stopped from achieving his goals is plagued by more European realities when he realises he's only human, out of shape and out of his depth.A compromise has to be made in terms of the resolution, and while it's not entirely satisfactory it could be argued that there is none that would be.",Stillwater
84,PerryAtTheMovies,The Bill show really....,6,18 August 2021,"(My Ratings)
Overall: 63/100
IMDb: 6/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Honestly, Matt Damon (Bill) was pretty good in this one. He made for a convincing redneck and an everyday, hardworking man. The chemistry between Damon and Camille Cottin was also nice. They made for a homely pair.Throughout I found myself rooting for Bill hoping he would find the answers needed to get his daughter out. Opposite that, I didn't care if Allison (Breslin) got out of prison. Breslin was rigid in her acting that she didn't bring real emotion to the role.The length of the film sucked too. At nearly 2.5 hours it really dragged on for a good portion. At times it was so slow that it felt like they ran out of time and had to smush a quick piece of film together just to get an ending.The story was good when Bill was the focal point. Everything from searching for a job, to visiting Marseille, to finding love, it was all enjoyable. I wanted more info on the turmoil and agony he experienced as his daughter was left to rot in jail. Opposite that goodness. As soon as Allison entered the picture I found the story that revolved around her dropped. None of it was truly interesting. I think it would've been slightly better to include some flashbacks for posterity, and to build some emotional attachment to the character, because as stated above, Breslin wasn't able to pull off that part herself.One last positive I enjoyed about the film was the French connection. They didn't just have everyone speaking English. French speakers spoke French for the most part with the odd supporting actor being able to speak both languages.The overall for me is that the film was good enough for one watch through. I'm happy I saw it on a cheap night. If you've been eyeing this film I would recommend going on a cheap night too, or waiting for it to release on a streaming service. I'm sure you'll be happy with any portion that involves Bill, but anything that involves Allison is just an obsolete feeling.Hope you liked the review, and as always, enjoy the show!",Stillwater

89,severindringel,A film wit ups and downs,7,12 September 2021,"It's always interesting that I find myself surprised by Matt Damon every time I watch him. After all, the triple Oscar-nominated actor has been delivering from film to film since his breakthrough role in 1997's Good Will Hunting and can quite rightly count himself among the best of his guild. It's probably the eternal Ben Affleck shadow that still hangs over Damon for me, and as a result I make the mistake of biasedly projecting his buddy's limited acting abilities onto Damon.In his new film Stillwater, Damon is once again the undisputed star. As the proud American Bill Baker, a middle-aged working class man, he couldn't fit the stereotype better. He always insists on the mannerisms of his culture, has the visual presence of the typical working-class American (shirt knitted in, cap, sunglasses) and acts cool to the outside world. May sound generic at first but Damon manages to use his special skill to perfection: His facial expression. Under the thick beard, which we are not used to seeing from him, there are always downturned corners of the mouth and above them eyes that say everything about his emotional world. In the process, Damon plays through pretty much everything. At one point he is hopeless and listless, then determined to help his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin), who is imprisoned in Marseille, and suddenly even romantic feelings come into play. Bill goes through all these emotions as soon as he travels to France at the very beginning of the film. At first he is only there to visit his daughter. But when he later finds a trail to free her from prison, new people come into his life. The theatre actress Virginie (Camille Cottin) and her daughter Maya (Lilou Siauvaud). Bill develops very special relationships with both of them in the course of the film, which later become so strong that he tries to make up for past mistakes with them. Parallel to his newfound identity, however, he is still confronted with Allison's case, which puts him in a quandary. Breslin is often frustrating in the daughter role, especially in terms of her decisions and reactions, but her chemistry with Damon gives the film, and especially Damon's character, needed fragility. Child actress Siauvaud as Maya provides even more, awakening qualities in Bill that were thought lost and making the character much more multifaceted.The director of the film is Tom McCarthy, who directed the Oscar winner Spotlight. In terms of pacing, Stillwater has a lot in common with the journalistic drama, especially in the first act. The camera stays on the protagonists for a long time and follows every step in detail. This results in strong individual performances that give the somewhat tough plot the necessary entertainment value. Because when the film was just over an hour long, I already thought it was at the end. Yet the plot takes another completely new direction, which makes sense but leaves a lot to be desired due to its tediousness. The last act makes up for it, but the film doesn't really know when it wants to end. The immense running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes is noticeable, but not too detrimental to the quality of the storytelling and the staging. In the end, Stillwater is a solid crime family drama with a great character study. The film's great strength, however, is that it shows Damon's character trying to reinvent himself in a different culture.",Stillwater

93,Instant_Palmer,Tom McCarthy is a Genius Filmmaker,9,29 October 2021,"McCarthy's body of work is stacking up and it is moving him into the neighborhood of all-time great film directors/screenwriters - If his only film was 'Spotlight', that would be enough, but 'Stillwater' just adds to his growing portfolio of brilliant work that also includes the endearing indie film-festival favorite 'The Station Agent'.Stillwater is a difficult film to watch - a film that resonates a theme that ""Life is brutal"" cannot be confused on any level as a feel good film, although there are some moments when that is the direction it seems to be headed.Under the surface flows tragedy, and a feeling of inevitable sadness unfolds out of truth. This is not a typical story you will find captured in movies. McCarthy was brave to take on this project and the film stays with you in a way I cannot recall ever feeling after seeing a movie, outside of an Ingmar Bergman film (never easy to digest).The acting was excellent - subtle, invisible, believable (certainly not a Bergman film trait). McCarthy has a way of connecting with actors that allows their craft to rise to the occasion of the scene and the story with total buy-in. It's like this in every one of his films. Perhaps he is leaning on his days as an actor, or his sometimes unique screenwriting prowess (McCarthy wrote the parts specifically for each of the three lead actors in The Station Agent), but whatever he is doing, it is working REALLY well.McCarthy's truly special filmmaking prowess was realized by many when Spotlight was released (best film of the past 25 years imo). Even at a relatively young age, his work points to filmmaking genius - without any reliance upon special effects or even Hitchcockian filmmaking techniques taught in film school (at least not noticeable).Few achieve this level of film craft by seemingly just turning on a camera and pointing it at actors, and that is sometimes what it feels like - being put in the same place as real people and being able to just watch the moments unfold. Perhaps that is one of his greatest ""tricks"".Brevity in scenes is also one of his trademarks - just the right amount of time - not dwelling too long nor going too quickly - this cannot be as easy to do as it sounds - McCarthy does this really well. McCarthy's brilliant editing prowess has always been a strength, and allows one to be encased in a story that could easily run 3 hours, but comes in at 2 hours 20 minutes. His efficiency is amazing.This movie does not neatly tie up the story in a Hollywood bow, and that is clearly by intent. Reading some other reviews, I can understand why that may lead to giving this film a low rating.But have we not seen those movies a hundred times before? Stillwaters (and secrets) run deep, and sometimes what we find when digging a hole is not what we expected when we first started out. Life indeed can be both beautiful and brutal. This film illustrates that paradox. Just be prepared for something atypical with Stillwater, and Matt Damon with an Okie drawl.",Stillwater
94,G00fhunter,Really Failed to keep my attention,4,26 August 2021,This movie could have been better. Matt Damon did a great job acting but this movie was boring from start to finish. Not really a fan of how they waited so long to even say why his daughter was in a foreign prison in the first place. Secondly most of the movie is about a romance that just ends up going nowhere. Save your time and just skip this one.4 out of 10.,Stillwater

96,dlmiley,Endearing relationships save this one,7,16 August 2021,"It is very loosely based on the Amanda Knox case in Italy (if you recall, she was convicted of killing her roommate in 2007, even though there was no evidence that she did it and there was evidence that someone else did the killing). ""Stillwater"" changes the location to Marseilles, France and makes the character a lesbian. Matt Damon plays her dad who attempts to prove her innocence. Staying in a motel, he meets an attractive French woman who agrees to help him. The French woman is a single parent with a cute little 9-year-old girl who steals the show at times. The highlight for me was Damon's character's relationship with the young girl - he seems to be making up for his failings with his own daughter and their relationship is endearingly sweet. The movie is well acted, and competently directed, so I rate it a 7/10.",Stillwater

Stillwater is one of them- a bold, subversive film that's not only timely but also emotionally riveting. The performances, direction and production value make this a worthy follow-up to Todd McCarthy's 2015 hit Spotlight. Matt Damon is as fantastic as ever along with the rest of the cast. The film immerses the viewer into the everyday lives and culture of both working class Americans and in France, and without being patronizing to either side. One of the best of 2021.Grade- 4/4 stars.",Stillwater

101,imdb2-5,Woke nonsense ruins film,3,12 September 2021,"Matt Damon plays a cold hick from Oklahoma. A large part of the film is very awkward. The connection of ice cold Damon with a dark-skinned French girl, who appears to be a far better actor than Damon, is not credible. She barely understands any English while Damon pours his heart out to her. But she understands one keyword to not her head and the bond forms.For no explainable reason, a French woman who is considering helping him asks whether he voted for Trump. It had no purpose other than to denigrate Trump at the expense of this film. And to add insult, the white man has a criminal record so he didn't vote at all.Moving further along, someone helping Damon on his quest discuss other people. Why? Because all he wants to do is put an Arab kid in jail. He doesn't care about justice.Damon's character understands the point about racism and justice. But for some unexplainable reason, he mentions that only cares about is his daughter. So of course, the response from the French lady is that he sounds like all Americans.This was a woke farce. It's disappointing because it could have been a good film. These activists must steamroll all over any audience and force them to admit that black people and Arabs and Muslims are the greatest victims on Earth. Each time the film promises to move forward in some direction, a stumbling block appears to remind us of just how much white supremacy exists and how detestable spoiled Americans are. And quite frankly, the supposed victim is so bratty that you're constantly hoping she stays in jail for the rest of her term.",Stillwater

Abigail Breslin played as Matt Damon's daughter and nothing to say about her performance.The only reliving character is that little girl acted as Maya (Lilou Siauvaud).

While watching the movie I felt a little lost because I wish I had known the reason why the mother/ex wife committed suicide in the story. This kind of seems like we started in the middle of a story that has two parts. It just sucks because The trailer was better than the movie. But I can also appreciate the lesson in this movie that sometimes when you look for the truth it may not exactly be what you think it is. In the mix of this movie or rather in the middle of this movie it is easy to tell that him and his French women have a chemistry that will make their connection stronger and we can also even see that The main character tries to re-raise a daughter. Meanwhile he is lying to his daughter at the same time that got arrested for a crime she committed. The ending of the movie is me find out that she did commit the crime and that Matt Damon had to go through a lot to get his daughter out of jail and he had a new outlook on life.

Basically a dad looking for ways to prove his daughter's innocence from a crime.Initially I was thinking that it was a really really good film, but as the film progresses, it turned out that things are not what it seemed like and there are a few plot twists here and there.However, Bill Baker has so much of ""plot armor"" that it is hard to take this film seriously. At some point in the film, it became kind of predictable what the ending will be.Overall, the excellent acting by a few actors/actresses saved the day along with the director's skills.

A central character that at first seems stubbornly dull is crafted into something more and more intriguing via an excellent Matt Damon, while the story itself is shaped by the people within it rather than Taken-style tropes about troubled European spots (from a US pov).It's a bit of a sprawl and could definitely have done with a trim on the running time but stick with it and there are surprising rewards.",Stillwater

However, the imprisoned daughter was absolutely unlikeable. After a couple scenes I would have just let her stay in jail -- she already had completed over half her sentence...
As for the plot, what was the point? Obviously based on the Amanda Knox story, there is nothing really interesting here. The father's ""simpleness"" was not used to great effect at all, French people simply helping for no reason and letting a stranger into their homes, the situations he may have gotten into, the language difficulties, the travel documents and administration...Do people think you just walk off the airplane and sympathetic French people open their homes and semi-fall in love with them, and no trouble finding a job, money, etc?Looking at the idea of ""semi"", the plot only half introduced several topics before completely losing them... Their was the good father (Matt Damon with Maya) sub-plot that ultimately went nowhere, the love interest plot that went nowhere, the mending of a relationship with an ungrateful daughter that went nowhere, the kidnapping of a potential murderer that went nowhere...

116,willcrabbe,Matt Damon holds this together,7,21 August 2021,"Stillwater is a slow but compelling drama aided by a great lead performance from Matt Damon. The first half was superior in my opinion with the second turning into a sort of lite version of Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners. The cinematography was great at times, obviously aided by the beautiful scenery of the South France coast and I also liked the original score, although it faded a bit towards the end. Abigail Breslin's wonky performance was definitely one of the weak links of the film. At times she was good, but at others she was utterly unconvincing and definitely took me out of the film. One of the strongest aspects was the relationship between Damon's character and the young French girl Maya, who was played superbly by Lilou Siauvaud in her film debut.While not great, Stillwater is still a very solid film that is definitely worth checking out. Just don't go in expecting a tense and high octane thriller rather than a more slow and methodical character study.",Stillwater

It is moving, heart wrenching, sweet and poignant. The leads give an astonishing performance, both Matt Damon with his low key blue-collar worker attitude and Camille Cottin as a struggling yet emerging actress, not to mention both supporting actresses, Lilou Siauvaud as Maya and Abigail Breslin as the male lead's daughter. The whole film is about love, lack of love, missing love, love you trying to get back, unwanted love, love you give instinctively, love that somehow finds you anyway. It is, indeed, a very good movie. One that makes you think about your priorities.Also, it is filmed the traditional way, no shaky camera (home video-like) trying to make you excited or anxious, which is a 10/10 picture-wise (to me).All in all: you get real life characters in a real life-like story that carries you all the way to the end.

He tries to make up for his past transgressions by being friendly with a local woman and her daughter. Naturally he messes that up as well. The daughter he's trying to save eventually is released because he did some of his own vigilantism but it turns out she was a part of it after all.The movie was really long for what it was and trying to mix the Midwest US culture with French Riviera culture is just really weird. I'll never watch it again but I guess I would recommend watching the first 20 minutes. If you can make it past that then keep watching. Definitely not for everyone.,Stillwater

Follows a father who moves from Oklahoma to Marseille, to help get his daughter out of prison for a murder she claims she didn't commit.The Good- This is a unique and fascinating journey. Some of the choices in this film were unpredictable and some of the twists here work very well. Matt Damon gives an amazing performance in this film and one of the best performances I have seen him give in a film. If you are interested in this film you should definitely go and watch this. The second act of this film was amazing and the focus of the movie changes here a lot. Some people might not like what they do in the third act. Personally I didn't mind it too much, it didn't ruin the film for me but I do think I'd have preferred them to go down a different route.The Bad- I do think this was 10 or 15 minutes they could of taken out of the film, especially in the first act. The first act was very weak. The film does take it's time to find it's focus and rhythm.Overall Thoughts- Stillwater was a beautifully shot movie that takes you on a very fascinating journey and gives you some very strong performances from all of our leads. The themes and messages are the strongest parts of this movie. It isn't a perfect movie however the good outweigh the bad enough for me to recommend this movie to people.

I don't know many Dads who would've even had that ability to do that.There are a few ""agenda"" pieces in this movie, but if you move past those when they come it's worth the watch. A couple of curves in here from out of the blue, if you're into a decent drama and slight mystery.

It was not meant to be a John Wick stunt festival. Instead, it displays the actions of a typical southwestern father in a perfectly believable manner. Bill Baker may be too dull for east and west coast audiences, but he is adequately representative of many Oklahoma/Texas citizens.The storyline was criticized as not demonstrative of the real life story upon which it was based. That may be, but as a fictional story it stands on its own merit. You see a father's love for his daughter and the choices he makes to redeem her.I do agree that it was a bit lengthy.

Yet, I struggle to find many words to describe Stillwater, as it leaves about as much aftertaste as its titular refreshment - this is something I am bound to forget immediately, despite being on board for large portions of the runtime. One part romantic drama about a born-and-bred American adapting to French culture, one part rote crime thriller about his stopping at nothing to free his wrongfully imprisoned daughter. The former is infinitely more interesting and developed than the latter, with the film itself largely disregarding the murder story for over an hour until it inevitably rears its ugly head; once Akim appears at the football game, I audibly sighed in anticipation of what was to come, and sure enough, this becomes immeasurably stupid in all scenes following his capture. Racial commentary is bluntly obvious here, with Marseilles locals looking to send any ""Arab kid"" to jail, and Oklahoma working-man Damon is hardly taken aback by this - the prejudice works both ways, though, as his eagle tattoo and clear accent make people assume he must be a Trump supporting, guns-blazing 'Murican. Nothing substantial or original to say about the topic, and it comes off clumsily; though, for a script with such thought-provoking lines as ""Life is brutal"", the lack of subtlety is unsurprising. Damon is always convincing but too understated to be a noticeably great performance. The rest of the cast is pretty okay, with a capable child actor and one particularly mediocre role (Damon's daughter, played by the little - well, not anymore - girl from Little Miss Sunshine!). Uneven plotting and story structure with plenty of room for trimming; beats like Allison's attempted suicide never go anywhere and characters such as her grandmother or the theatre director come and go almost at random. ""Matt Damon becomes part of French family"" turns out to be an involving film - ""Matt Damon re-enacts Prisoners as part of a murder mystery thriller without any mystery or thrills, with a resolution so tepid and developments so thin that we hardly care in the first place"", not so much. I have nothing to say about the cinematography or music, which could have come from any movie.

Instead the movie had many story lines and the last part of the movie just dropped those. To many unanswered questions that led up to the outcome.

141,trav123,Solid acting yet coldwater of a story esp ending,7,22 August 2021,"I was very excited to see Matt Damon play a simple part in the french city of Marseille and the trailer looked like a thriller. I enjoyed most of the film yet it was far from a thriller and more of a character study/love story mixed in with some bizarre Amanda Knox rip off intertwined in the story which ultimately ends up being its McGuffin that does not really work.Matt Damon does a phenomenal job playing the simple yet humble Roughneck from Oklahoma which seems so out of place in Marseille it is almost comical. Yet it works and he is so ideal for the part that you start to wonder why on earth did he decide to do this simple story of a film. Of course the director did Spotlight so it makes sense but the script in the 1st act is too slow and meanders without pushing the story forward, and the 3rd act is too abrupt and it ends almost in a wither that some might find blaise and meaningless - yet for me it actually worked; as the main point of the story seems to be a failed father trying to regain his daughters love - again. Even once he realizes that his daughter is partially or mostly at fault for her lovers death that got out of hand by the hired thug.I loved the last lines of "" Life is Brutal"" and after spending time in France Matt Damon's character sees his hometown of Oklahoma totally different. This part could have been fleshed out better but it is a solid film.It probably only deserves a 5 or 6 stars but I give it 7 because I loved seeing a film shot in Marseille and the love story had amazing chemistry with Matt and local woman Virginie and the adorable little girl Maya.",Stillwater

Stillwater has none of these.To say it's tedious is an understate. The storyline drags, as does the acting. There's little to no emotional attachment to any of the characters. The lack of empathy created leaves you squirming in your seat for over 2 hours.In short, I'd normally give it a 5 but have scored it lower to offset the ludicrously higher rating it has gained by the fake reviews.Do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth.

Even though hes not a bad dude, he will tie up and beat some dude in her basement like a creepy Dahmer version of Liam Neilson in Taken, to prove his daughters innocence. Who by the way doesn't even appreciate it. Probably the only real aspect of this story. The acting at points was superb, which is to be expected with the cast.

150,choonmixer95,Great Movie,8,1 October 2021,"Although this was a long movie I do feel it was justified. The story has very clear start, middle and end sections and each needs time to play out.At the beginning, the Bill Baker character is a straight forward, god fearing gentle American tough guy who has many burdens to carry - not least his daughter languishing in a French jail for murder - but also his own unemployment, his ex-wife's suicide and his past drinking and poor parenting. All this needs to emerge from the narrative slowly as he travels to Marseille to make one of his regular visits to his daughter.The middle section deals beautifully with his growing friendship with a local French child and her mother. The growth in their friendship and trust is a high point of the movie and the script deals beautifully with the language and cultural issues. All this against a backstory of Bill trying to prove his daughter's innocence.The final section has several twists to the 'thriller' narrative that has been set up in the beginning and middle sections which leads to some highly realistic outcomes in my opinion.What I really liked about this movie was the acting which was superb - especially Matt Damon, Camille Cottin and Lilou Siauvaud. The script was tight and well crafted and the story moved efficiently through the narrative. There was very little waste despite the long running time.The end may not suit some but for me it was both satisfying and entirely realistic. There were no loose ends as so often happens and I felt that the final scene was perfect for the story that had gone before.An excellent watch.",Stillwater

154,whitetowel-74786,Damon gets lost in translation.,4,20 August 2021,"I went into this one with high hopes, but alas like so many other recent high profile flicks it was as disappointing as stale popcorn with fake butter. Despite a fine turn from Matt Damon in full Oakie redneck mode (with an honourable mention for Lilou Siauva as the little girl), i'm afraid there is little else to recommend Stillwater as a must-see-movie.Loosely based on the compelling real life drama of Amanda Knox, director Todd McCarthy fails to deliver on the promise of his well-known source material, instead dropping the ball with a lukewarm tale set (mostly) in seedy Marseille France, that is way too uneventful, drawn out and dumbed down to engage the viewer all the way through it's tedious 2-hour twenty run time.Further to this, Stillwater's biggest faux pas is a failure to convey viewer sympathy or compassion towards Damon's banged-up-abroad daughter played by 'Scream Queen' Abigail Breslin. This big mistake ultimately derails the whole movie, with the final somewhat shady outcome between father and daughter making matters even worse.An opportunity totally missed here, Stillwater is further hindered by the annoying (subtitled) French heavy dialogue throughout. Do yourselves a favour and go watch some real-life Foxy Knoxy on You Tube instead, it's far more compelling and entertaining than this dull, underwhelming trans-Atlantic outing. Cie la vie.",Stillwater

I don't understand how you could put so much effort into a film just to do that. Why the final scene in the prison? What happened to the guy in the basement? The cop? What happened to Maya?

Damon did a good job with the ""defined character"" - but that character was mostly plodding and lacking in any intelligence, insight and charm.And Damon himself is not particularly good-looking.Thus very hard to believe that the lovely and intelligent Camille Cottin would have any romantic interest in him.This might have been a role for a younger Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell or Matthew McConaughey - someone who could be an uneducated ""redneck"" but at the same have inherent intelligence and a bit of charm or good looks.",Stillwater

As a Frenchman, I enjoyed the fact they filmed in Marseilles and talk about a very difficult subject (Marseilles Northern Districts are basically outlaw zone where French law no longer applies).Outside of that, it doesn't quite reach the 8-10/10 mark, such as Prisoners (2013) and others.

It is to the director's credit that he avoids this easy option. Neither Bill Baker nor his daughter are particularly admirable people, though Bill, played by Matt Damon, does have a dogged persistence in his attempt to prove the innocence of his daughter, despite her ingratitude for his efforts. The heart of the film is Bill's developing relationship with Virginie, and her young daughter Maya. They are without doubt the most sympathetic characters in the plot, and the tragedy of the tale is that, ultimately, he destroys that relationship in order to rescue his daughter, a person who doesn't seem worthy of that sacrifice, and who appears to have been at least partly culpable in her friend's death. Whilst some viewers might feel cheated by the lack of a happy ending, I admired the bravery of the film in avoiding that easy pay-off.",Stillwater

I disagree with that and I thought the actress played her very well. When you take into context (viewed in the rear mirror of having watched the movie), you understand her actions and words from the beginning. I don't think it is a spoiler to say that her growing up a lesbian in Stillwater, Oklahoma, could not have been easy. And with the other things which are described to us from her childhood would have culminated in her really believing that the world was stacked against her from the outset.A sad movie in many respects, but one also that leaves you with some hope and I think one of those movies that may have the effect of improving whoever watches it.",Stillwater

207,deepdive10,Flawed but succeeded in a subtle way,7,27 August 2021,"The film is nuanced and subtle and for that reason perhaps led to many of the not so great reviews both by critics and viewers alike. What made it worth watching to begin with was Matt Damon who, as the character calls for, is ""thick"" both physically and emotionally and represents, for the filmmakers, a fair portion of heartland Americans. People exposed to little outside their small town lives and emotionally subscribed to blind faith in Christianity. The character finding himself in Marseilles, France, is rich with contrast. The good but insensitive American as against the world of the French woman, Camille Cottin, a charismatic actress, who helps him with translating and from whom he rents a room is the most interesting part of the film. Meanwhile the case of his daughter being in prison, loosely based on the true story of Amanda Knoxx, goes through the motions.It is the end, when they are both back in Stillwater, that is devastating and I believe what the filmmakers were leading up to all along.",Stillwater

218,jeri-mcclure,Truly Awful,3,22 August 2021,"Stillwater trades on every stereotype of an ignorant, ""damn it, I know better and I'll do it myself"" roughneck. The moment Damon tells a French lawyer, who's recommending he use an investigator, 'no I'm not gonna do that', I tapped out mentally. Damon's character say's he can't vote because he's a felon (taking a pass on the "" did you vote for Trump"" question, why was that necessary to the story). However, later on he tells his hosts daughter he owns a gun, also not allowed by law if you're a convicted felon; horribly cliche. His hosts electricity isn't working, no worries ""I'll fix it""; because there's no difference between European and American electrical systems. He's in a strange country, doesn't speak the language, has little to know money, but he's going to take on a foreign legal system. By the time he stomps around France looking for the presumed ""real"" killer and gets the crap beat out of him I was praying this was prelude to an awakening. The acting is passable, the story uninspired, the cliches abundant. I see why Amanda Knox is angry. Stillwater also traded on every lurid, unproven rumor put forth by the prosecution at her multiple trials.",Stillwater
219,audax_ultor,Slow and rushed ending,4,26 August 2021,"Matt and Maya were great. I have to agree with reviews here. Also for me was very slow pace and just too long.

221,randomfx01,The best of Matt Damon,10,29 September 2021,"I'm not sure what I expected from this movie and as such had no expectations. It really resonated with me on many levels. Working away, hard drinking, rough gritty existence. The sacrifice of family life, for 14 hour days, 7 day weeks and months at a time. The escape through drugs, partying and drinking when on leave, also to the detriment of any kind of meaningful relationships when ashore. The chance to do it better next time. The measure of a man is not through his faff-ups, but his willingness not to repeat the same mistakes. If you are expecting a fast-paced action movie, I dare say you may be disappointed. This is slow, yet enthralling. Occasional wokeness threatens, but is swiftly dismissed. The LGBT+ daughter is an ungrateful millennial , while not being very likable. Is an apt metaphor for the youth of today. Maya, the little French half-caste is adorable on the other hand and is an absolute delight. Whom melts the heart of our stilted anti-hero and eventually leads our American lost in France to love. The whole movie is a great microcosm for the working class dad, trying to adapt to todays Social Justice Warriors and modern woke ideals. Assuming you and yours tell the truth...",Stillwater

The way he grabbed the pen... this man was angry and ready for action!When he went to the basement and the old guy showed him some tools, everything was obvious. He was supposed to forge some apocalyptic weapons, but what happened instead? He fixed the house!

231,tonybertocchi,Completely unexpected.,8,13 August 2021,"I watched the new Matt Damon movie the other day and was totally surprised - in a good way. I watched it because my friend is very fond of the lead. I'm somewhat indifferent. But all the same - the chance to see a flick in a cinema just after lockdown is always a good thing. The film, Stillwater, sets itself up as ""daughter in danger in non-American places and dad needs to rescue her"" kind of thing. You almost wonder why Liam Neeson isn't in it. And this holds true for the first two acts, almost to the point of parody. Damon as said dad seems at first to nauseatingly embody the trope. He's a recovered alcoholic, christian, gun-toting rough-neck, who cleans up after tornados in the American south. A complete cliche. His daughter is falsely imprisoned by an arrogant system that appears deaf to his ideals of justice (in this case, the French courts). Finding himself unable to get any traction with his daughter's case, he sets out on his own - further invoking a maverick trope - while enlisting the help of a beautiful, younger woman - a single mother - while charming her daughter. As totally expected.However, at this point, the third act veers wildly off its expected course and becomes an exploration and a crucible for ideals of individualism versus the collective good, and switches from a dumb thriller to a much more contemplative work. And all this is accomplished with some very sophisticated writing. Rather than have Damon's character be clicheed and static, the film rather feeds into and then questions his and our own expectations. There's a brilliant moment here where his character is asked whether he voted for Trump. Damon's answer, and the following two lines each entirely open the film's discourses up to a huge scope of ideas and commentary on modern America. This part of the film dissolves so many of the constructs of its initial genre that it almost becomes pastoral; that is until its pyrrhic conclusion. A fabulous commentary on deeply ingrained American mis-understandings about the world, I can't imagine the film will play well in the U. S. - other than in the art-house circuit. But no matter, an intriguing ride that completely disorients the viewer.",Stillwater

I was fully engaged in the film with strong performances from the main characters.I enjoyed Matt Damon's portrayal of an ordinary father wanting to do the best for his daughter. He almost played an anti-Bourne type character, who didn't know what he should be doing, but led by his passion redeeming himself from his errant past, he was prepared to do whatever it takes to support his daughter.Similarly, Camille Cotton, played a single mother who helps Damon's character and shows the power of kindness. Cotton's 9yo daughter, Lilou Sauvaud, provided Damon the opportunity to the father he hadn't been and their rapport was a highlight for me; the way they helped each other, the childlike innocence mixed with the adult belligerence to overcome language barriers.In hindsight there are some parts where tighter editing would have been beneficial, however there was a good intensity to the film and particularly towards the end.I would definitely recommend.",Stillwater

This could have been a more than fulfilling film about guilt, belonging, prejudices and ultimately redemption. All key factors were in place somewhere midway through this film. By that time we have made some less convincing huddles, but over all Damon, the engaging plot and some good observations more than make up for them.It is at this point the movie decides to go for the obvious route: fake suspense, unnecessary clarity, unbelievable coincidences and even hilariously misplaced romance!And it goes on like this....for about 30 to 40 minutes after missing the mentioned exit. It is a skill to know when your movie is finished. When a story is told. I honestly believed McCarthy had that skill after watching Spotlight, but obviously that turns out to not be the case.Stillwater now leaves you feeling you've watched a mess. While it has plenty of elements that could have turned it into a homerun. But homeruns never run themselves. You have to believe and dare.McCarthy and associates obviously lacked courage.

I guess it allowed him to have some sort of redemption but ultimately he remained the same troubled man that couldn't be trusted.

I was immersed in his character, Virginie, and Maya throughout his experience in France. Allison was terribly flat and not well-executed. My wife and I agree that she was the worst part of the film and we feel that he was happiest living in France. We also feel she should've remained in prison and his efforts were not worth his while as, spoiler, the daughter is an accomplice and a perpetuator of the murder of Lina, as found out in the end scenes. It was well done in many aspects, with a realistic ending of life, frankly, sucking. Definitely worthwhile, just irritating that Allison was given another chance at life she didn't deserve.",Stillwater

Nope. Not that kind of a movie. It is a story of a father who is trying hard to be a better human being in this cruel world. The interrelation among the main characters of the movie seemed realistic and believable. The movie also portrays Marseilles in its background in an authentic manner. The kid actress (Lilou Siauvaud) was pretty good keeping up with Matt Damon. If you enjoy ""drama"" genre, you will more-or-less enjoy the movie.

275,phoenixthottam,Go See This Film -- Beautifully filmed. Sharply written script & Extraordinary Acting by Damon & Supporting Cast.,10,30 July 2021,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED : ""STILLWATER"" (Matt Damon, Camille Cottin)
Go See This Film -- Beautifully filmed. Sharply written script & Extraordinary Acting by Damon & Supporting Cast.This is arguably one of Matt Damon's best works to date. The plot of the film keys off the foundational metaphor story for Amanda Knox's past trial & tribulations in Italy --- but it is much more. Its a window into the soul of a man, his relationship with his daughter and the architecture of his world (in which he is a journeyman contractor) and that of other words he crosses into. Damon plays an off-again/on-again contract oil-rig worker who is on a rescue mission for his daughter who he believes is wronfully serving a 9 year term (half-way through it) in a French prison for someone else's murder crime. Damon goes on a journey of self-discovery as he overcomes cultural and legal barriers as well as the limits of his own language and cultural background. We watch as he gradually rearchitects/rebuilds his own world.His dawning realizations as a contractor and revising of his prior tightly held views & life 'truths' throughout the film are artfully done. Damon is a master of his acting craft consistently throughout the film. Camille Cottin and her daughter portray the two women from Marseilles France who actuate transformation in Damon's Hero's Journey.The dialog is real. The transitions and cultural viewpoints exquisitely put together.Go see this film. Support it. Tell others to see it. Stillwater is a diamond in the rough in so much of the nonsense that comes out of Hollywood these days.",Stillwater

It provides with scenes depicting the main character's struggle to correct his past mistakes. All actors and actresses in this film are excellent. The direction has good pace, the cinematography and editing is top tier.Where the film topples itself is:
First with Damon's character deciding to abduct the Akim character and hide him in the basement. I would definitely buy that if he was still living in the States alone. But in France while having himself invested in a new relationship? No.Second, the plot twist that his daughter is in fact guilty of her girlfriend's death and the big plot hole that comes along with that. If she was guilty of planning the crime, why would she make such a fuss with her letter and the story about Akim in the beginning of the movie? If the authorities had found him, she would still be found guilty for planning the crime and paying someone else to do it. In fact it would be to her best interest, when she heard about the Akim story circulating if she had just shut up entirely and did her time.If the story from the get-go stated without any doubt or mystery about, that it was She who killed her girlfriend, this element alone would propel Damon's character to a deeper struggle to accept that his daughter is a toxic person, and would even create more doubts in him if he has what it takes to start a healthy, new life with the French family. And of course the decision he would have to make if where to cut ties entirely with is daughter.",Stillwater

I've seen some reviews that say he tries too hard - I couldn't disagree more. In addition, Abigail Breslin surprised me with how good she was. I haven't seen one of her movies in a long time, but I really thought she showed her talent through this role. She was emotional at all the right times and didn't overdo it. Some people might say this film is slow, but personally, I think it's just very realistic. It's not the Taken type of movie, where big things happen at every twist and turn.

It is difficult to imagine anyone else carrying off the role so successfully. The major theme here is parenting negligence and parental sacrifice, as well as demonstrating that life never presents us with easy choices. The trailer underplays the drama. The only difficulty I had with the movie was that it was a little slow to kick off. I liked the fact that we were introduced to actors we might normally never see who were totally credible in their roles (the private detective, the Arab youths, the policemen, the supportive friend). The chemistry between the two leads seems very natural, and it is great to see age appropriate people acting opposite each other. The football match scene is terrific. If you like typical Hollywood fare this is not for you; the backdrop is Marseille in France at its grittiest and the prison scenes are also bleak. Unlike other reviewers I found the daughter convincing. Very well done to all concerned. I enjoyed it so much I will go again next week.",Stillwater

A solid 10 out of 10. Matt Damon disappears into his role as Bill Baker.Alas, the distributors have created a misleading ""official trailer"" to promote it. It is absolutely NOT a Jason-Bourne-style action suspense thriller.""Stillwater"" is a nuanced, thoughtful character drama centring on one man - Bill Baker (Matt Damon), a laid-off oil-rig worker in Stillwater, Oklahoma - who seeks to rebuild a stable family life and mend his relationship with his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin), who was raised by her grandmother. Bill was mostly an absentee father during her childhood.Bill is taciturn, bluff, stoic. He is used to heavy labour, good with his hands, able to fix things - essential hands-on knowledge that no university education can teach. He can still find work as a labourer for a few days or weeks at a time, and gets by as best he can. He knows he hasn't made the most of his life, but is now clean and sober.While at university, Allison has been convicted of a crime that landed her in prison with a nine-year sentence.Bill has become focused on one paramount objective, to which he devotes his energies and whatever funds he can muster: getting Allison exonerated from that crime.The film's unrushed pacing is just right. We're not given any backstory laid out before us in a tidy preface. We make Bill's acquaintance bit by bit, through brief scenes of his day-to-day life. When he says he's going to see Allison again, it sounds as if he'll probably drive somewhere in his truck.Only when he receives his boarding passes at the airport do we learn that seeing Allison is not a simple thing, as the desk agent confirms that he's connecting through Atlanta and Frankfurt.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW*His destination is Marseilles, the gritty rough-and-tumble southern French port city where Allison was convicted.The first time he arrives at the prison, where Allison has already served over half her sentence, we see its log of his visits. The series of dated entries reveals that he has made these visits many times.In his hotel, he befriends a little girl, Maya (Lilou Siauvaud), when he does her a small act of kindness. Then he meets Maya's mother, Virginie (Camille Cottin), who is moving to Marseilles from Paris.Everyone in the story is marginalised in some way. This isn't a tale about people considered noteworthy in their lives or in their work. There are no powerful or wealthy élites here, only single parents and poorly-paid jobs, and migrants who are very likely undocumented. These people are all an essential part of our communities. By their labour they are the cogs that help make things work. Yet they are left behind as have-nots in our society.In his continual efforts to get Allison exonerated, Bill is isolated because he doesn't know any French. He can only relate to locals who speak English, and relies on them to interpret for him.For those brief scenes where everyone around Bill is speaking in French only, we have the benefit of subtitles to understand what they're saying. Bill can understand nothing. He is an outsider. We feel his helplessness and frustration.Events and plot twists drive the story forward. Bill makes critical mistakes and reaches a point where there is no resolution to a dilemma he has created for himself. Worst of all is a tragic misjudgment that has guided his actions for years.During this particular trip, Bill has been away much longer than he originally intended. By the time he finally returns to Stillwater, his life perspective has been transformed.The climax is a punch in the gut.All too late he realises, as do we, that what he was truly looking for, a chance for a stable family life, including a strong parental bond, is no longer to be found in Stillwater. It slipped through his fingers in Marseilles.""Stillwater"" is a stunner. Matt Damon inhabits Bill Baker's soul brilliantly.A solid 10 out of 10.",Stillwater

319,lindus,Slow movie about father's love,7,6 September 2021,"Just saw this and can only say that it is a long and dragging movie. There are so many scenes that could be cut and be compressed or are just down right not needed at all.In the end the story is a tragedy about how a girl gets into the wrong place at the wrong time and has ended up in prison due to her actions. She does though have a repentant father who loves her enough to spend his life's savings to regularly travel to see her far far away from where he lives and works.The characters are never really given a thorough background so you don't really understand why they act like they do. The daughter's behaviour is bratty and like a spoilt child toward her father, even though his committment to her. Yeah, sure, he might have been a poor father once but committing to seeing her regularly for 5 years should one would hope make her put two and two together but that does not seem the case.The father meets a former ""Parisienne"" who just embodies all that is wrong with big city intellectuals. She has is forced to move from Paris when she has had an out of wedlock child with a beach bar owner who's business is in Corsica. So instead of trying to make sure the child is close to the father she goes back to Paris, and then Marseille, to live her own life as an actress.The movie is touching and the only person you really understand is the father and his actions to clear his daughter's name and be able to leave prison.Was it worth 2 hours and 20 minutes of my time, not really, so unless you're a Matt Damon fan, I would not recommend you to see it.

331,ajsstanley,Finally a European take on an American story,9,8 November 2021,"This film is beautiful - sets you up for a typical American style film, but arrives at a place with far more depth and nuance. It allows for a realistic journey and delivers with incredible performances. Highly recommend!",Stillwater

337,dale31,Disappointing !!!,3,10 August 2021,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie starring Matt Damon.I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this movie.First: It was way too long
Second: I found it very slow moving and Very Tedious. It just kind of went meandering on
Third: The ending was Extremely Predictable.I could go on, but I won't ...you get the main idea here.",Stillwater
338,saskloppers,The only star of Stillwater is Lilou Siauvaud,1,31 August 2021,"Matt Damon movies have all rung hollow, and more so over the last decade.With a messy storyline and stupid ending which spoils the story that remain in tatters throughout, being the final nail in the coffin, Stillwater compounds the fact that Damon is a thrid rated actor who's movies is not watch worthy.The performance of Abigail Breslin is also sub mediocre. But enough said about her. Thankfully she occupies little time on the screen.Camille Cottin's role is played within convincing reason. She does a reasonable job and is watch worthy in future roles.The shining star is the loveable, bright, cheeky and cute Lilou Siauvaud. Siauvaud is a natural and has a bright future ahead of her. Hopefully she will be guided away from roles featuring once powerful turned B rated actors like Damon.Without Lilou, much of the movie is like watching paint dry. A waste of time.",Stillwater
