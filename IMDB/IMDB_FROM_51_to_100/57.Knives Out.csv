0,MartinHafer,How can this film currently have a 6.8 rating when it's one of the best pictures of the year?!,9,3 November 2019,"Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie.",Knives Out
1,TheLittleSongbird,Well worth tucking into,8,10 February 2021,"It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.Found myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.Wouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.However, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.It is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.Moreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.Overall, very, very good. 8/10",Knives Out
2,Leofwine_draca,"Fun, albeit no classic",6,1 August 2020,"KNIVES OUT is another comedy blockbuster based on the classic 'old dark house' style murder mystery plot that was once popular in the 1930s. The last time we had a wave of such movies was in the '80s, when the likes of CLUE was doing the rounds. This is a fairly amiable and enjoyable example of the genre, graced with a large ensemble cast each striving to out-perform one another, a fast pace and never a slow moment. Inevitably the plot itself feels quite artificial at times and stretches credulity on more than one occasion, but at least there are enough likeable or amusing characters and enough genuine surprises to keep you involved in what's going on. As for Daniel Craig, I have a suspicion that this is an easy kind of performance in a role that could be played by any actor, but he's funny enough in the part.",Knives Out
3,SnoopyStyle,intrigued,7,26 May 2020,"Wealthy murder mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is dead from a presumed suicide. The investigating police is joined by dapper private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who was hired by an unknown person. It's a family of annoying backbiting leeches and Harlan's kindly nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) who cannot lie without vomiting.Quite frankly, the movie is a fifty-fifty proposition for the first half. The family is so annoying and Daniel Craig is trying so hard to act. I really need him to stop his accent work. His character would be perfectly great with a British accent. It's all far too peculiar as Rian Johnson is doing his Brick work. The movie reveals the death early on and it seemed obviously from the very beginning that it boils down to the tox screen. She's on the hook as soon as that reveals her mistake. Non of it can cover that up. It becomes a lot of running around in circles.Then something happens that hooks me into the movie. I started rooting for her to escape Blanc's questioning. The vomiting starts as a silly gimmick at first but ends up helping build a good amount of tension. The last incident is obvious even before it starts but it's still fun. The tox screen is the flashing warning sign throughout the early parts even if it's never mentioned. I kept waiting. When it finally shows up as a major plot point, it seems problematic since there are bound to be copies. Chris Evans adds a great energy in the second half. Despite the nagging questions, it becomes a fun rollercoaster ride. It's a lot of ups and downs but it's never in doubt that it will roll safely to an exit. One thing that bugs me more than most. I don't know what Fran assumes about Ransom's scheme. She sees him tampering with the drugs but she steals the bag. What's the point of that? She steals a copy of the report but the original is bound to come out. What's the point of that? She blackmails him and meets him alone in an empty laundromat. What's the point of that? I don't think Fran's actions make any sense and is nothing more than a series of necessary moves for plot advancement which can all be excuse with Blanc saying that she doesn't even know what's happening. I have come to see Rian Johnson as a filmmaker with interesting style but sometimes his convoluted stories do not favor deeper examinations. Overall, I really got into this movie despite whatever nagging reservations I had about the plot.",Knives Out
4,Hitchcoc,Lots of Nice Little Twists,8,29 March 2020,"No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity.",Knives Out
5,boblipton,A Fine B Movie,8,1 December 2019,"The mystery writer Christopher Plummer has died. Although the police have just about wrapped up their investigation, his nurse, Ana de Armas is nervous; she knows that she had given him the wrong doses of medicine, the antidote was missing from her bag, and he had slashed his throat after arranging with her an elaborate charade so she would would not be suspected. The family and police were satisfied, yet here is the great detective Daniel Craig, holding it open. He has been hired to investigate, although he does not know by whom. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Plummer's vast fortune is Miss de Armas.Once upon a time, the movie theaters ran full programs of selected short subjects, a feature film, and quite often a second feature. The second features were generally lower-budgeted movies, meant to be rented out to the theaters at a flat rate, and often genre films.... like mystery films. Some of these second features were series, and quite popular; it was no unknown for people to go to a show specifically for the second feature, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, or a Charlie Chan mystery, featuring stars who perhaps did not shine brightly enough for the major studios' A pictures, but would bring in the customers.Eventually, the program shortened: no more selected short subjects, no more second feature. Nowadays, a movie show usually consists of a feature film and previews of coming attractions. Yet, long as it is, and with such a varied and interesting cast as it has -- Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and half a dozen others -- this movie strikes me as a B picture, with an ornate plot, some small and gratifying witticisms.... in short, a superior example of the form.If you are wise enough to see this movie, you will be sorely confused, as mystery is piled atop mystery, and how to untangle them all. I know I was. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile.",Knives Out
6,Horst_In_Translation,Great fun watch with an interesting crime story,8,13 January 2020,"""Knives Out"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 2019 that made it now in 2020 also here to Germany. The writer and director is Rian Johnson and I am a bit unsure about him honestly. His very first film ""Brick"" I was not big on at all, maybe because also the lead role seemed miscast, but some of his other career works I enjoy a lot and that includes of course also his television work on the marvellous Breaking Bad. But now he is safe on the big screen. Seems a very versatile guy anyway, not too long ago he directed a pretty nice music video for LCD Soundsystem. Anyway, for this film here that runs for slightly over 2 hours, so not a short watch at all, he received his very first Oscar nomination this morning and a huge success for him and after seeing the film now, it is not undeserving at all. The movie also achieved nice accolades at all kinds of other award shows, such as Golden Globe nominations for Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas. For Craig it was the first believe it or not and even if I like him there's no way I can say that Ana de Armas is not the film's brightest spot and I would have liked her to get an Oscar nomination as well. Oh well, maybe at some point in the future. As for the other cast members, you will find many big names here. They are all supporting and I guess it comes down to how much you like them when deciding who's your favorite because they all do not have the biggest impact on the story, but are nice to watch. I personally enjoyed Shannon the most, which is not a surprise because that is true for almost every film he is in. Really versatile actor. Don Johnson I found most forgettable perhaps, but this was also expected as I don't have much connection with him in other films and the revelation about his character being unfaithful also added very little for me, even if the way how his wife found out was kinda funny. Christopher Plummer can of course also always be relied on and it's so nice to see that even close to the age of 90, he is still dellivering quality portrayals that are pretty much flawless. Luckily, even if his character is killed right at the beginning of the film, the man gets a lot of screen time as we get closer to finding out what actually happened.So it is a crime story and Johnson took an interesting path here. He gave us the detailed solution who did it and what exactly happened already before half of the film is over. But this is also only half the truth as we find out at the end. I do not really want to go too much into detail about the ending and how everything unfolds because you should experience that yourself. I just felt somehow that they all did it maybe (they all planned it), but then it was just one bad guy, but he was really very bad as we see when he grabs that knife and unlucky for him, it was just an artificial knife this time, which really (also with the slow motion scene leading to it) was absolutely hilarious and I and almost everybody else in the theatre was laughing so hard. Brilliant reference at that point back to the film's beginning when we have Chris Plummer's character (I think it was him) say something about how knives are sometimes real and sometimes just imitations. Luckily, that one was an imitation because it would have been heartbreaking if the guy really could have killed de Armas' character. She is also pretty stunning no denying. But so is Katherine Langford.Anyway, let's not get carried away on looks now, or at least not human looks. That knife throne already made for a nice smile on my lips with how Craig sits in it and all the knives are pointing at him. Really nice and smart and creative inclusion of the murder/suicide weapon. As for the Armas, her character is really depicted in such an innocent manner in the sense of how she is really the ultimately good human being. That made her truly memorable with how things played out at the end. Still in-between, I cannot deny that I thought maybe actually she was not that nice and in fact an evil mastermind, like when she immediately said that it was Hemsworth's character who wanted her to drive and put the blame on him. But it was nothing. Still, clearly Johnson was toying with the idea that we in the audience could think she murdered the old man on purpose knowing she was the one who'd get it all. Very talented actress, she delivered her part too and also nailed her funnier moments, which admittedly also had a lot to do with the script like when she tells Shannon's character that it is perfect because she has the money to get great lawyers or of course in another epic moment when the film closes exactly the way it started, with a cup that has some pretty memorable words on it that will again have you in stitches.I mean it is not a perfect mvoie, but there really isn't too much wrong. Maybe I struggled with believing that Craig's character actually knew it all so quickly because of the blood spot and also the exact revelation came totally out of nowhere at the end and he must be a true mastermind that he figured it all out so effortlessly apparently. But as a huge Bond fan, I cannot really say anything negative at all about his character. Or about the actor. He made some great career choices in terms of which films he played in in recent years and knowing the upcoming is his last appearance as 007, I am not only genuinely curious about this one, but also about all other projects he will work on in the future. I think there may be some great things in store. Perhaps he can even collaborate with Johnson again and give us a sequel/prequel here that is about how he solved the tennis player case that is mentioned on one occasion in this movie by another character. By the way, the Black policeman was really forgettable here, the other White officer though brought in some nice comedy with how much he was in awe of the creative people around him, especially at the end when he shushes his colleague down. Have to mention the Cluedo quote as well.Okay, let me think what else can I say about this film. It is a pretty long one yes, but it was so interesting and entertaining that it really flew by. There is great attention to detail here on so many occasions. One excellent example is how the female protagonist was really good enough in her profession that she took the right medicine because she saw the difference in color, which really made me appreciate de Armas' character even more. Okay the story with the other woman blackmailing the killer I could have done without probably, but even these more mediocre scenes and moments only fade because everything else constructed around them is so awesome. They are still okay by general standards and even these include moments of true creativity, such as the reference about ""you"" not being ""Hugh"" and how only staff calls him that. So no matter which perspective you take, it is difficult to find any real reasons why this film should get a thumbs-down. The good in here is just so much more frequent and permanent than the weak, which is pretty much not existent anyway.Oh yeah, I really shall not forget about the super old lady there: She does not even need to say a word to make for comedic gold, be it early on when we find out nobody knows how old she really is (from Collette) or later on when she sits there right in front of the window and sees de Armas' character (also pay attention how nobody can remember which country she is from originally and how they wanted her to be at the funeral, but more people were against it) or when she sits with Craig's character later on. Okay maybe she would have been more interesting if she actually did not know what was going on around her instead of telling Craig's character and the explanation about what she said in detail and that it explained how Hemsworth's character returned before that already also did not really convince me, but I am glad she was included nonetheless. This was maybe my favorite comedy film from 2019, despite the serious undertone and crime(s) happening, because I kinda struggle with seeing Tarantino's new film as a comedy, even if that one was as good as this one here, or maybe even slightly inferior. Okay, that is all then. Of course I give ""Knives Out"" a (very) positive recommendation and it is for sure among the most astounding cinematic achievements from the last 52 weeks. Highly recommended and please please make another movie about Benoit Blanc.",Knives Out
7,Prismark10,Knives Out,6,28 December 2019,"Knives Out is a star studded whodunit where all the suspects are gathered in the mansion.It is a knowing variation of the board game Cluedo which itself was turned into a movie in the mid 1980s.

A recently changed will might lead to a motive.This comedy mystery is reliant on Harlan's personal nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) a woman who physically throws up if she tells a lie.Following the conventions of many Agatha Christie mysteries, Knives Out turns a lot of the essential ingredients of the genre in his head by adding several layers to the story.However it is not original as there have been several movies that have twisted the crime mystery genre.

They interview the dysfunctional family members and the servants that lived or worked with Harlan in his mansion but when his testament is opened, the investigation presents twists and surprises.""Knives Out"" is an entertaining but overrated film in the style of Agatha Christie. Benoit Blanc is a kind of Sherlock Holmes and the cast is excellent. The screenplay begins without any character development and the viewer learns the characters along the investigation. Consequently the beginning is a little boring. But it is worthwhile watching this film without expecting the hype around. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Entre Facas e Segredos"" (""Between Knives and Secrets"")",Knives Out

10,kosmasp,Expectations and ... well,10,31 March 2020,"When you are really really anxious to watch a movie, because you believe it is good, it can turn out to become quite sour. Especially when that movie does not even come close to what you wanted it to be. Now if you are a fan of crime movies and ""whodunnit"" stories, this will not just tickle your interest, this will give you joy.Now I know that others may work otherwise with expectations and how they deal with twists and other things. You can see a few things coming, some may even argue they know everything (something I personally can't imagine, because the guessing game is strong in this one - and yes don't compare this to the directors Star Wars entry) ... but the way this is edited, the way the story unfolds and not even to mention how great the acting is ... this is rated high and very deservedly so!

Plenty of twists, turns and red herrings, it's a smashing mix of drama and humour.Terrific acting from the ensemble cast, Daniel Craig, Toni Colette, Jamie Lee Curtis all wonderful, Chris Evans was awesome.It has been a success, it'll be interesting to see if it does reawaken the whodunit genre.9/10",Knives Out
12,classicsoncall,"""I feel the noose tightening...""",10,20 March 2020,"I knew right from the start I was going to like this picture. It had a jaunty opening setting the tone, and as the characters were introduced, you knew you were going to be in for a compelling, old style murder mystery on a par with ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (both versions). I'm surprised this wasn't one of the candidates for Best Picture since there was room for one more in the Oscar line up, it seems like an oversight.The thing is though, you can't waver in your attention because you might miss something important, as there is a lot to take in with the multitude of Thrombey family members. My favorite here was probably Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) himself, even though he was the murder victim and not on screen very much. The only thing I couldn't fathom was Harlan slitting his own throat to protect Marta Cabrera from a murder charge. Can anyone picture themselves doing that? It made me shudder.Switching gears from his James Bond persona, Daniel Craig is quite entertaining as private investigator Benoit Blanc. I'm not too convinced that a real live Blanc would have been able to put all the pieces together to solve the mystery of Harlan Thrombey's death, but seeing it all play out on screen was a hoot and a half. With a great cast portraying hungry, would be inheritance seekers, the stage is set for a provocative and fun filled murder mystery. You really ought to check it out.",Knives Out

Like the miniseries ""The Politician"", it shows what people end up doing when they have unlimited wealth.Definitely see it. You're in for some real surprises.",Knives Out
14,jboothmillard,Knives Out,7,7 December 2019,"We all love a good whodunit, the most famous sleuths like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple deducing a murderer from an A-list cast of suspects, well, now comes this modern day movie in the same league, written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick Lane, Looper, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Last Jedi). Basically, wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday and invites his family to his mansion for his party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds him dead, apparently having slit his own throat. An anonymous figure hires private detective Benoit Blanc (Golden Globe nominated Daniel Craig) to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan had alienated many of the family: he had threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson) for having an affair; cut off the allowance of his daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette) for stealing money, meant for the tuition for his granddaughter Megan ""Meg"" (Katherine Langford); fired his youngest son Walter ""Walt"" (Michael Shannon) from his publishing company; and cut his lazy grandson Ransom (Chris Evans) out of his will. Flashbacks reveal that after the party Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera (Golden Globe nominated Ana de Armas) accidentally injected Harlan with a fatal dose of morphine. Minutes from death, Harlan told Marta how to avoid suspicion, making it appear he was still alive after she had driven home, then he slit his own throat. Because Marta cannot lie without vomiting, she avoids answering the questions of Detective Lieutenant Elliot (LaKeith Stanfield), but Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence, but is only partially successful. The family, including Harlan's eldest daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), is shocked to hear from Harlan's lawyer Alan Stevens (Frank Oz) that Harlan left everything to Marta. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom tricks Marta into confessing to him but offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys realize that, under the slayer rule, Marta will lose the inheritance if she killed Harlan, but Blanc tells them that they all are still suspects. They try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance. Marta receives a blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc spots her and Ransom, the police catch and arrest Random, while Blanc tells Marta that Wanetta ""Great Nana"" Thrombey (K Callan), Harlan's mother, saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's upstairs rooms on the night of his death. Marta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged. Marta confesses everything to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds Fran had the copy of the full toxicology report. Marta is about to confess everything to the family, but Blanc stops after finding something missing in the report. He brings Marta, Ransom and the police to a room to reveal his deductions. Ransom learned that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, so he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials so she would kill Harlan with an overdose, so she would not gain the inheritance. However, Marta, an experienced nurse, administered the correct medicine without reading the labels. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later witnesses Ransom swapping the vials back and sent him the blackmail note. Realising that Marta had given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom passed on the blackmail note to Marta, removing the address and time. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy the evidence of Marta's innocence and burned Fran's copy of the toxicology report. He drugged Fran with morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. Marta receives a call from the hospital and says that Fran is alive. Believing that Fran will implicate him, Ransom angrily confesses, and vows revenge. Marta vomits on Ransom; she lied that Fran had survived, and tricked Ransom into confessing. In anger, he grabs a knife from the wall to attack and kill her, but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. Ransom is taken into custody, while Marta watches him and the Thrombey family members from the balcony of what is now her mansion. Also starring Jaeden Martell as Jacob Thrombey, Noah Segan as Trooper Wagner, Riki Lindhome as Donna Thrombey, M. Emmet Walsh as Mr. Proofroc, Marlene Forte as Mrs. Cabrera and Shyrley Rodriguez as Alicia Cabrera, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a voice cameo as Detective Hardrock. Craig is likeably comical as the detective from the Deep South (he sounds like Foghorn Leghorn lol), and other cast members like Curtis, Collette and Armas look like they are having a blast, Evans get some of the best lines throwing insults. The whodunit is a well-trodden genre, but with the addition of a witty script and some deadpan humour along the way, this is a terrific refreshing take on it, I admit you have to really concentrate to get the concluding twist, but I'd like to see a follow-up, overall an entertaining murder mystery. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Rian Johnson, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",Knives Out
15,BA_Harrison,"All is not forgiven, but it's a good start.",8,26 November 2019,"After giving us the godawful Star Wars movie The Last Jedi, I was ready to get my knives out for anything directed by Rian Johnson, but I was pleasantly surprised by this engrossing, star-studded whodunit. While its twists aren't always unpredictable, the film is still a whole lot of Agatha Christie-style fun, as private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel the mystery behind the death of wealthy novelist Harlan Thrombey, with numerous suspects among his family and staff.Is Harlan's Guatamalan caregiver Marta (Ana de Armas) responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.With such a great cast (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Colette, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon), the performances are solid, and everyone looks like they're having a whale of a time with the old-style murder/mystery shenanigans. If you push all thoughts of The Last Jedi out of your mind (a big ask, I grant you), there's a good chance you'll have a good time too.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Knives Out

18,BandSAboutMovies,Hyped!,5,29 January 2020,"Rian Johnson has jumped genres throughout his career - the noir Brick, the comedy of The Brothers Bloom, the science fiction of Looper, the big blockbuster that was Star Wars: the Last Jedi and now Knives Out. He also helmed an episode of Breaking Bad that won him a directing Emmy.Since 2005, Johnson has had this Agatha Christie-influenced film in mind. He also cited films like Deathtrap and Clue as cultural touchstones for this movie.So what's it all about? Well, crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead - a suicide - at his estate the day after his 85th birthday. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired by an unnamed party to investigate the crime. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.First things first: my attention span has been ruined by a steady diet of grindhouse movies, Hong Kong cinema and the works of Italian gorehounds. A movie over two hours long is quite intimidating to me, but I did my best to stick with it.So the good things: Daniel Craig is absolutely having the time of his life playing private detective Benoit Blanc and every scene with him is a joy to watch. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot, as well as the detection flashbacks, which brought to mind the original Murder on the Orient Express. And it's always great to see Plummer in a movie, as he was, after all the emperor of the galaxy in Starcrash. Yes, that's my cultural callback for this venerated actor.This movie is a chance for Chris Evans to break out of the superhero mold he's found himself in. And Ana de Armas - who is also in the Eli Roth film Knock Knock - is great as Marta Cabrera, the nurse who finds herself inheriting the estate of the murdered writer who is the patriarch of this family of liars and thieves at the heart of this story.Hey - there's M. Emmet Walsh, filling in for Ricky Jay who died during production. And Riki Lindhome from Garfunkle and Oates and the remake of The Last House on the Left (and also Under the Silver Lake). Plus, it's cool to see Frank Oz in his first onscreen role since, well, Blues Brothers 2000.But man - there are so many characters here that have little or no time to shine. Jamie Lee Curtis is basically playing a cameo role and you could say the same thing for Toni Colette, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson.When we reached the one hour point, my wife asked me, ""How much longer does this have?"" I told her that we weren't even halfway done yet and she replied, ""What else do they have to tell us?""I liked the film more than her. Despite reading reviews filled with hyperbole saying things about how this movie has reinvented the murder mystery and turned it on its head, I thought it was a pleasant enough diversion. It's not going to replace Agatha Christie movies for me, but for an audience that has probably never seen the films like Sleuth and Gosford Park that Johnson is inspired by, it's certainly a revelation for them.Your mileage, as I always say, may vary.",Knives Out
19,Coventry,Pimp My Agatha Christie!,8,18 December 2019,"With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)",Knives Out

But was it really suicide...or murder? Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts investigating.Good mystery. It's full of twists and turns and has some funny moments. Also there's some stunning production design--LOVE the house Plummer lives in. There's also a large great cast giving good performances. No one is bad but Craig, Curtis and Evans are excellent. Still I didn't love it. It's a little too long and gets needlessly convoluted at the end. Also a lot of the humor fell flat and some of these characters are really vicious.

22,CinemaSerf,A good effort in this hard-to-innovate genre.,7,27 November 2019,"This is good - but it isn't great. Ana de Armas competently, if not vibrantly, takes centre stage with Daniel Craig - sporting a deep Kentuckian accent - playing the Poirot-esque private detective role. Chris Evans leads the remainder of this accomplished, if somewhat under-utilised cast in a murder-mystery caper that doesn't quite have the brio I'd hoped for. It moves along well enough, though and is good fun to watch. It just doesn't quite catch fire. It dips a bit in the middle too, and could probably lose about 20 minutes without compromising the story very much (if at all). You won't guess the ending - unless you have a crystal ball - so it's certainly worth going to see.",Knives Out

My first impression at the opening, as the camera tracked through the grounds of Gotrocks Manor, then entered and trawled past paraphernalia like that seen in Mank's adaptation of Sleuth with Caine and Olivier was that we were in Rip-Off Central but whereas Sleuth was a two-hander here we have a matching set of suspects aka red herrings to banish all thoughts of rip-off. It's well done, glossy, slick but ultimately empty as an election promise.",Knives Out
24,zardoz-13,A Cutting Edge Crime Comedy,9,20 December 2019,"James Bond actor Daniel Craig plays amateur sleuth Benoit Blanc in ""Looper"" director Rian Johnson's elaborate, tongue-in-cheek whodunit ""Knives Out"" (***1/2 OUT OF ****) who describes the murder as a donut. He clarifies, however, that inside that donut is a second donut with its own hole. This convoluted crime caper is neither blood-spattered nor gruesome, so nobody need complain about anything looking remotely offensive. Indeed, we are given a glimpse of the murder victim after he has slit his throat, but the camera doesn't linger on this unsavory scene. Although profanity is held to a minimum, the F-word is uttered once, while the S-word is heard multiple times. Meantime, Johnson keeps everything fairly lighthearted throughout this 130-minute melodrama, with enough red herrings to keep you guessing about the identity of the killer. Mind you, the culprit is neither an intruder nor a blade-wielding maniac, but simply an irate member of a flawed family who feels betrayed by the family patriarch.Basically, world-renowned, bestselling mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer of ""Waterloo"") appears to have committed suicide with his family ensconced on the premises. Thrombey's dysfunctional clan had converged on his secluded estate deep in the Massachusetts woods to celebrate his 85th birthday. ""Knives Out"" boasts a first-class cast, featuring Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and Christopher Plummer. Veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh also makes a cameo. Although it rambles on loquaciously for two hours and ten minutes, Johnson jams a lot of action and exposition into those two plus hours to keep it amusing. Each of the family suspects in this murder-mystery is given as close to a three-dimensional character as time permits. Not surprisingly, each has a legitimate reason to want Harlan dead, and they lie not only to the authorities but also to Benoit Blanc.Relying largely on red herrings (false clues), flashbacks, and testimonials from Thrombey clan members, ""Knives Out"" chronicles the investigation of Harlan Thrombey's death, which has all the earmarks of a suicide but turns out to be a homicide. Half of the action takes place at the Thrombey estate, while other scenes occur at Marta Cabrera's apartment in the city. An amusing car chase also transpires in town as well as a discovery later at an abandoned laundromat. Known as ""the last of the gentleman sleuths,"" Benoit Blanc assists the local constabulary in their homicide investigation. Apparently, following his 85th birthday party, Harlan Thrombey settled down for the evening in his upstairs den. After his nurse Marta (Ana De Arma of ""Knock Knock"") had administered his evening injections, she departed at approximately midnight. Harlan's grown-up son Walt (Michael Shannon of ""Man of Steel"") saw him later that same night. The following morning, Harlan's housekeeper, Fran (Edi Patterson of ""Troop Zero""), discovers his dead body and his slashed throat. While the police grill family members, Blanc lounges in the background, plinking on a piano. He shadows the detectives, but he doesn't believe a single word any of the family members utter. Everybody carries a chip on their respective shoulders where Harlan was concerned. Walt handled Harlan's publishing business, while the rest of the family benefitted from the elder patriarch's largesse. Nevertheless, Harlan has changed his will and written his entire family out of it! He has uncovered treachery on their part and punishes them for their deceit. Rather than turn his $60 million fortune and publishing empire over to them, Harlan wills it to his trusted nurse. Naturally, the Thrombey family is shocked. Initially, each had promised to take care of Marta. They treated her as part of ""their family,"" but now they urge her to return the money to them.Eventually, the truth of the matter, particularly Harlan's suicide, comes out. Nothing about it, however, is neat. As it turns out, Marta and Harlan had their own respective alibis. Moreover, it is ironic that things happened the way they did. One question that has baffled Blanc the entire time is his contribution to the investigation. He reveals that he received an envelope without a return address, but it came packed with a thick wad of greenbacks. Somebody in the family apparently wanted him to scrutinize all the testimonies and unearth something the police may have overlooked. As the audience, one of the first things we're shown occurs during Harlan's medical injections. It appears that Marta had gotten the prescription bottles switched, and she gave him a larger injection of Morphine than usual. Afterward, Marta ransacks her medical bag, but she cannot find the antidote for a drug overdose. Harlan realizes that he will die in several minutes, and he concocts a scheme that will not incriminate Marta. Furthermore, he also plans to commit suicide in an effort to conceal the wrong injection. Marta finds it difficult to answer questions truthfully. Moreover, she suffers from a peculiar condition which prompts her to projectile vomit after she tells a lie. Repeatedly, Johnson has a field day with Marta's projectile vomiting as a recurring gag.If you thought Daniel Craig was hilarious as Joe Bang in ""Logan Lucky,"" you'll be in stitches at his ersatz Southern accent that owes more to Foghorn Leghorn than Tennessee Williams. Craig plays a character diametrically opposite from his James Bond. Benoit Blanc is actually a little goofy as are most of the characters. Johnson ridicules all the Thrombey clan, except Marta. In the long run, Benoit solves the murder with a little help from the self-sacrificing Marta, and the guilty party is exposed. Benoit qualifies as the equivalent of the legendary Agatha Christie character Hercule Poirot. Furthermore, unlike his role as James Bond, Craig's latest character relies on his wits rather than his mitts in unraveling the tangled web of duplicity. The Thrombey Estate is something to see, and the multi-storied house with several flights and noisy stairs is the perfect setting for this quasi-Agatha Christie pastiche. Altogether, ""Knives Out"" qualifies as a cutting-edge, murder-mystery comedy.",Knives Out

Blanc finds an ally and useful source of information in Marta, Harlan Thrombey's nurse. However, Marta may know more than she is letting on.Excellent murder-drama, written and directed by Rian Johnson. Highly original and intelligent plot that starts like a Hercule Poirot mystery but pretty quickly follows its own unique track. Quite clever audience manipulation by Johnson: you think you have it all sussed out...but you don't. Wonderfully unpredictable and murky, while appearing transparent.All-star cast delivers in spades. Daniel Craig is great as Benoit Blanc, putting on a southern accent and pulling it off with aplomb. Supporting cast includes Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Christopher Plummer and none of them put a foot wrong.

Might she not have a secret?This darkly funny who-dun-what is brilliantly cast and acted. But the writing and direction is stellar, too, so the fantastic cast just puts the cream on top. The plot appears simple, but is very well conceived - you think you should know what's going on, but you never quite do.And I must give all credit to Rian Johnson, a man I was perfectly willing to hate for the rest of my life for the way he wilfully scorned his audience in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

29,view_and_review,Politicized Whodunit,6,27 November 2019,"In this politicized whodunit a wealthy family patriarch is found dead in his room. What looks like nothing more than a suicide has an air of foul play once private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts digging into it.This movie is comparable to the likes of Clue or Murder on the Orient Express. At the center is a very astute Sherlock Holmes-like detective and in his midst are many potential suspects.I wanted to like the movie more because it was funny and it was clever. The politicization was a bit off-putting but that wasn't what I took the most exception with. I had a problem with the main character, or at least the development of the main character.Sharing much of the screen time with Daniel Craig was Ana De Armas playing Marta Cabrera, the nurse of the deceased patriarch, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). We learned through intermittent exposition that she was the nurse and friend of Harlan Thrombey. We also learned that she was the purest character in the movie and it irked me.While the Thrombey family was primarily self-centered a-holes Marta was so angelic that she couldn't even tell a lie without vomiting. That brought about some laughs, but when combined with her overall character it made her sickeningly saintly. When Harlan predictably left his entire estate to her I kept wondering when she would reveal her true colors because no one is this pure of heart.As a matter of principle, I didn't have a problem with Harlan leaving his wealth to his nurse. There have been movies like that in which an unlikely but deserving character inherits the wealth. But the manner in which Marta was made the heir was too raw and undeveloped. There was not enough backstory and character development between the two of them to make that action a readily acceptable action. We only got a five minute scene in order to see the close relationship between Harlan and Marta, which is not nearly enough. With the absence of several scenes to show their closeness and Harlan's distance from his own family, the willing of his wealth to her was rather flat. It came off as odd or eccentric as opposed to well thought out and intentional. It was thrust in there so abruptly that I was sure Marta was playing all of them.In fact, I would have liked the movie even more if the hardworking, overlooked, and underestimated Latina was playing a role just to get rich. It would've fit far more than the hardworking nurse with a heart of gold that got an inheritance because a wealthy old man took a liking to her.I'm not eliminating the possibility that Marta did play Harlan and the entire family. There was a hint of such a scheme at two points I can remember.At one point there was a scene in which Harlan told Marta that he did what she told him and cut them all off. It was a brief exchange but it could have been a hint that Marta was pulling the strings.Then there was the end when she was sipping from the mug which read, ""My House, My Rules, My Coffee""-- it could have been her smug, ""I just played all of you"" moment. But it was hard to tell.As murder mysteries go, this was decent. You come to expect the unexpected so I wasn't blown away. The cast was great, if only the flawless character wasn't so flawless.",Knives Out

But I like to laugh and have fun at a movie too, and man did I do both at ""Knives Out."" Rian Johnson embraces the murder mystery genre wholesale and delivers a twisty-turner thriller that's both wildly entertaining and very funny. A superlative cast, witty screenplay, and brilliantly quirky production design are three of this movie's standout qualities. Daniel Craig, complete with Southern Gothic accent, and Ana de Armas are the leads, but they're surrounded by a cast of supporting actors performing at the top of their game.

31,ferguson-6,wheel of knives,8,26 November 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""I suspect 'fow-uhl' play."" So states the renowned and poetically named private detective, Benoit Blanc. Of course when mega-wealthy, best-selling author Harlan Thrombey supposedly commits suicide after his 85th birthday party by slashing his own throat with a knife, something more sinister (you know, like ... murder) must be considered. The violin playing over the opening shots of the palatial Thrombey manor teases us with thoughts of most any year from the past 75. These nostalgic thoughts fade quickly as we begin to meet the players.Detective Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (a quite funny Noah Segan) seem merely to be crossing their T's in the suicide investigation as they dutifully meet with each family member for a statement. It's this progression of questioning that introduces us to the year's most colorful ensemble cast. Patriarch Thrombey's (Christopher Plummer) scheming heirs-in-waiting include: his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), happy to remind you of her success as a self-made businessperson; Linda's smarmy husband Richard (Don Johnson); their renegade son Ransom (Chris Evans) who arrives a bit later; Harlan's son Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon) who 'runs' the family publishing business; Harlan's ex-daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette), a self-help guru who has a secret side gig; grandkids Meg (Katherine Langford), preppy social media troll Jacob (Jaeden Martell), and Donna (Riki Lindhome of ""Garfunkel and Oates""); and Harlan's mother Greatnana (Dallas' own K Callan). Two key non-family members are the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) who finds Harlan's body, and nurse Marta (Ana de Armas), Harlan's friend and only real confidante.Writer-director Rian Johnson has put together a diverse career with such films as indie breakout BRICK (2005), science fiction hit LOOPER (2012) and of course, STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII - THE LAST JEDI (2018). With this latest, he shows a real flair with a rare comedic whodunit, and manages to perfectly execute his twisted script of twisted personalities. Think of this as Agatha Christie meets CLUE via THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. The overall mangled morality of this entitled family becomes crystal clear as we get to know each. Johnson presents many familiar elements for fans of the mystery genre (the dark mansion, the creepy line-up of hangers-on, the red-herring clues and missteps), and most impressively, he blends those with many creative and surprising moments ... some that will have you believing you have it figured out. But even if you do, the long and winding road is an utter blast.Even with that deep and talented cast, it's Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta who stand out. They have the most screen time and neither waste a moment. Mr. Craig's purposefully comedic southern drawl completes the film's most memorable character, in fact, one of the year's most memorable characters. Ms. de Armas finally finds a role to take advantage of her skill. Nurse Marta has a lie-detecting reflux gag that is not just valuable to the case, but also vital to the loudest audience reaction during the film. Mr. Craig and Ms. de Armas will also appear together in the upcoming Bond film NO TIME TO DIE.During the reading of the will, director Johnson brings in STAR WARS stalwart Frank Oz (best known as Yoda) to play the family attorney, while another scene features one of the all-time great character actors (and Roger Ebert favorite) M. Emmet Walsh (BLOOD SIMPLE). Mr. Johnson also offers a unique spin on classism and the 1%, including a running gag about Marta's nation of origin.Johnson's regular team is in top form here: Cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Film Editor Bob Ducsay, and composer Nathan Johnson (Rian's cousin). Another deserving of mention is Costume Designer Jenny Eagan, who matches threads with personality about as effectively as we've seen, and Production Designer David Crank who creates the ideal mansion of secrets. This film is wickedly clever and barrels of fun. There may not have been a more purely entertaining movie this year ... and it's been a terrific year for movies. Just remember: 'My house. My rules. My coffee.""",Knives Out

The Agatha Christie style who dunnit with an all star cast is involving and fun to watch. The tension you feel for the character Marta played well by Armas is unique. So there is an inventiveness that keeps the viewer concentrating for clues and wrapped up in the dynamic of the characters. The in fighting in the family is funny. And the way they turn on her is painfully real. The way nasty relatives are shown may be too close to home for some viewers.Christopher Plummer is amazing actor - he in his late eighties and the rest of the cast hams it up including Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig with an exaggerated but intelligible accent. In ""Fierce People"" Chris Evans acted a similar role so it was a bit of a déjà vu how his character turned out.But there are some flaws. The grand explanation with the switching of the medicine is confusing and unconvincing. Also the family wasn't that bad to justify a total disinheriting. If the patriarch wanted to help Marta he didn't have to leave her everything. She was doing a job well and a sizeable legacy would have sufficed. There is a political slant to the story that Agatha Christie wouldn't have had. Here the writer pits the sweet good hearted daughter of an illegal immigrant against the evil white entitled wealthy mercenary people.

33,gradyharp,'You have a regurgitative reaction to mistruths',10,19 September 2020,"Rian Johnson both wrote and directed this tantalizing mystery KNIVES OUT that resurrects the memory of Dame Agatha Christie, the Queen of mystery writers. For those who disbelieve his stature in this film, see it now. He has created a detective figure in Benoit Blanc that rivals Hercule Poirot!As much a story about a dysfunctional family's greed as a detective tale, the story (as briefly as is possible without committing spoilers) is condensed by Lionsgate as follows: 'When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.' But that outline fails to focus on the intricate personality dissections of Harlan's family - and house staff: the shrewish Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her cheating husband Richard (Don Johnson) and their finagling son Ransom (Chris Evans); the vitriolic son Walt (Michael Shannon) and his wily wife Joni (Toni Collette) and their children Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell) and Donna (Riki Lindhome); and Harlan's ancient mother Greatnana Wanette (K Calllan). Add to the mix the policemen (LaKeith Stanfield and Noah Segan), the house staff- healthcare nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) and housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) and everyone has a fine reason for wanting to see Harlan Thrombey dead!Daniel Craig shines as Benoit Blanc, despite an at times annoying overly Southern drawl, as does Ana de Armas, and the manner in which he pieces together the mystery is spot on.

Ana de Armas is brilliant and her performance not only holds the attention but holds the film together. Daniel Craig is ostensibly the main star but his performance as the eccentric private detective who will solves everything is not strong enough and this allows de Armas to dominate, which I'm sure was the director's intention.

A cast of celebrity actors for even the smaller roles, a story that has all the elements in the clear, inviting the viewer to solve the mystery themselves and a clear feeling of people enjoying their work. I have to say, with sadness in my heart, that being used with movies having the twist at the end based on ad-hoc information than the viewer wasn't even privy to, I didn't even try to figure the mystery out. I invite you to do so, because once you try, it's pretty satisfying.The movie is a bit too long and for people not feeling nostalgic about the mystery series they were watching when they were children it might feel a bit dry.",Knives Out

While underneath it all lies and rep tape unfolds as a murder mystery tries to hide. Christopher Plummer is the family patriarch and most famous novelist of mystery and suspense and it's crazy when his 85th birthday party becomes a crime scene of it's own. His assorted offspring which consist of kids and in laws(to name a few Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, and Toni Collette) and these folks start to squabble and dodge the truth.Enter detective Blanc(Daniel Craig) who stalks the case in his own manner as the film twists and turns and reveals things you as the viewer don't see coming, it's like the film is just a tweak of classic murder mysteries as the Drysdale group is so combative and eccentric(also look for a stand alone performance from Ana de Armas) that this picture puts plenty on the viewers plate as many entertaining themes are present.",Knives Out
39,DKosty123,Surprising New Twist on Mystery Genre,8,14 April 2020,"Benoit Blanc - you would think that a lead character with a strange accent would sound more like a Frenchman who draws escargo into the plot. Nope, this might be one of the best tung-in-cheek characters ever on the trail of a murder. There's Comedy afoot here but it is not realized immediately. In fact so many viewers are misled by Rian Johnson's plot that a lot of the reviews I have read here don't even realize the classic comedy put into this which is actually funnier than the all-star Murder By Death where Obi One Kanobe is a blind butler.When I started this film, I thought well an opening scene murder is not new. Then it seemed like it was a night mare of sorts. Then I got a Columbo twist as it seems too obvious who guilty and thought this was going to be a comedy more than mystery as Benoit Blanc appears befuddled despite obvious facts and guilt right in front of him. Then the twists come into play.The party on the night of the murder-suicide is replayed like layers of an onion several times in the film. Each time as it is unwound there is a different aspect of the party revealed. It's actually darned fine writing, a surprise to be sure. Could it have worked if there was another ending? Possibly, but this ending is so funny and a little twisted that the entertainment for this genre film is way above average.Folks here tend to look at the names in that cast and think that they should have been given better dialogue? Benoit Blanc gets some of the best humor lines ever in a film like this. When you make a comedy and disguise it by making it a mystery as well, you have to remember casts do not get a lot of great lines or acting in a comedy. So while handing out an Oscar for Best Supporting role in a Mystery film, you have to ask yourself why back ground characters would get great dialogue? Not gonna happen, though the caretakers role here is the best played. Daniel Craig proves he is great at subtle comedy as Benoit Blanc.When all is said and done, this film grabbed my attention because it is different. I like it because by making the comedy so understated it twists the plot into a neat mystery within some classic lines. If your not entertained here by the holes in the donut, then your missing the point. Rian Johnson is laughing at you as a viewer if you do not get what he has done here. Considering a Benoit Blanc sequel is on the way, he is laughing all the way to the bank. I am laughing with him, because I am wondering how the sequel is gonna be anywhere near as entertaining or as funny as this one is? I am looking forward to finding that one out.It's obvious who the murderer is only this one sets a trap that a few viewers got out of. They didn't seem to get the jokes. Maybe the sequel should just use the same cast and locales and rewrite the will? No, that would really be confusing though Benoit Blanc could then bring in the knives?",Knives Out

In real life, however, this is everything. See, Jamie Lee Curtis is so against smoking, she once said that anyone who chooses to smoke doesn't deserve medical insurance.I used to smoke, for 22 years. Been clean for 2 years and 3 months tomorrow. But, when I heard her say this, I was smoking and was pissed that she obviously didn't understand addiction. And then...it all came out about HER addiction. Not to nicotine, but something else. No...not yogurt. So, maybe this was her way of saying she understands and her earlier statement is wrong.I digress. This whodunit with so many incredible actors - yes, including Jamie Lee, whom I do love, was equally wonderful. I love this kind of quirky mystery and they don't make 'em like they used to.I went into this so cold, I barely knew 5% of this film. I felt and was right about the theme and mood. But the twists and how it would play out: a complete mystery to me. And should be to you, as well.Relish in great acting, tongue in cheek atmosphere and just have fun trying to solve it yourself as I did and then find yourself completely wrong. Yes, watch yourself get so tied up and think it's so obvious, you'll be pleasantly surprised.Also, it's not a Clue remake. I thought it was when it was announced and when the trailers came out. I mean, I guess it COULD be an homage to the movie/board game Clue, but it's not. Enjoy it for the fun, funny and mystery it is.***Final thoughts: On my one and only cruise, last day, before we were debarking, I was in the elevator to get the level where I could go out and smoke. (See? I used to, back then anyways.) I saw a woman traveling with me in the lift and I was floored. It WAS Jamie Lee Curtis, I swore to myself. When I did a double/triple take with her, she smiled at me as if she knew I knew it was her. Anyways, she ended up at the same place as I was at: the outdoor smoking deck and she smoked. It was right then and there I knew: it couldn't be her. She was so anti-smoking, this couldn't be the real Jamie Lee.Now, after watching this movie...the case has officially been reopened.",Knives Out

45,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Refreshing, old fashioned murder mystery",9,12 October 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOn the night of his eighty fifth birthday, millionaire Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found murdered in his room at the top of his mansion, plunging his family, including Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), her husband Richard (Don Johnson), Walt (Michael Shannon), and Joni (Toni Collette) into a flurry of speculation as to who the killer could be. Attention falls on Marta (Ana de Armas) the South American carer of Harlan, who emerges as closer to Harlan than they thought. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) must use all his sleuthing skills to get to the bottom of it all, as black sheep of the family Ransom (Chris Evans) comes back on the scene.Upon its initial release, near enough this time last year, writer/director Rian Johnson's all star murder mystery emerged as unfortunately titled, as controversy emerged surrounding the release of the film Blue Story, allegedly sparking mass brawls in cinemas around the country, on the back of a 'knife crime' epidemic (before COVID-19 had even been heard of.) This was, of course, a massive contextual double standard, and simply geared towards the delightfully old fashioned crime thriller it's aiming to be.In a generation of cinema where the target demographic's attention span is visibly reduced, eagerly awaiting the release of the next Avengers or Fast & Furious film, Johnson's sprawling crime saga is an ode to a time where attention must be paid to every detail, in order not to miss a clue. There is an undeniable political slant to it, with it's immigrant hero merging triumphant, and main characters debating the pros and cons of immigration, alluding to Trump in a non too subtle way, but not to the detriment of the story, which keeps you hooked all the way to the end.It's a game of Cluedo come to life, with an all star cast delivering stunning portrayals of conflicting eccentrics, each plotting against each other for their own grubby ends. It's an eccentric, original piece of work in and of itself, though, which stands out in an age of interchangeable guff. ****",Knives Out
46,Pjtaylor-96-138044,I suspect acclaim.,8,1 December 2019,"'Knives Out (2019)' is the kind of movie they don't make anymore, a mansion-based whodunnit with an all-star cast and a charismatically quirky lead, but that doesn't mean it's old-fashioned. In fact, it feels fresh, modern and genre-literate. It uses its cinematic awareness to craft a devilishly enjoyable fable, a fun and evolving mystery that delivers the goods on pretty much all fronts. Despite what the marketing would have you believe, Daniel ""Bored Of Bond"" Craig isn't the protagonist. This makes for a detective story in which the detective isn't the one you want to see succeed, even though he isn't an antagonist in any shape or form, and this is rather refreshing. By giving certain aspects of its story away shockingly early, the flick leans away from suspicion and head-first into suspense. Johnson still manages to add an ample amount of wrinkles to the plot as it thickens, though. It's unpredictable and engaging throughout, peppered with the sort of surprises that the genre demands. Even though it does end with the typical, detective-led exposition dump, it's an incredibly satisfying experience. This is primarily because you're always engaged by proceedings, kept on your toes as the ultimately rather unique story unravels. It's a crowd-pleasing affair, a clever twist on its well-worn premise that still conforms to certain expectations. It's also fairly well-written, dialogue-heavy but not plodding, and has a good sense of tone, playing with the absurdities of Cluedo-esque situations without reducing its overall sincerity. It's aware of what it is but it isn't annoyingly meta. The crisp cinematography compliments its almost timeless feel, while the assured direction establishes itself as stylish yet subdued. Every core player plays their role excellently, no matter how much time or attention they're actually awarded. That includes the previously mentioned Craig, whose chewy southern drawl actually isn't as distracting as it could have been. Shannon, Evans, Plummer and De Armas stand out as being particularly good, too, regardless of the size of their role. Much of the family is side-lined for the majority of the time, but their presence is still keenly felt and they sufficiently support the more important characters. It's hard to imagine a cast better than this and everyone delivers on the unspoken promise of their inclusion. In the end, this is a surprisingly intelligent and entertaining experience. It generally keeps getting better as it goes on. When everything falls into place, it's hard not to get a smile on your face. It's great. 8/10",Knives Out
47,ThomasDrufke,Donuts,9,3 December 2019,"After getting unnecessary fan-hate after directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson returned to the big screen to direct a murder mystery like no other. And I feel like I'm comfortable saying this is close to a crime thriller masterpiece. Filled with earned twists and turns, incredible character depth, meticulous direction, and a wonderful time at the movies for all ages. And if I'm not mistaken, this was Ana de Armas' first true starring role, and she absolutely nailed it. She is a star in the making.

49,Cineanalyst,Murder Written for Actors,8,13 March 2020,"Critics and audiences are right, this is a fun movie. ""Knives Out"" is a clever twist on the whodunit, murder-mystery genre. There's a bit of a commentary on immigration and entitlement in regards to contemporary American politics and the inheritance of wealth, but more interesting methinks is how this narrative unfolds around a writer and actors, as well as the usual detective. Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a writer of murder-mystery books (although, ironically, he doesn't allow for them to be adapted into movies), is found dead of apparent suicide, but a detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), suspects foul play. Ordinarily, we might share the position of the detective in regards to solving the crime, with much of the fun being in seeing whether we could keep up with or figure it out before him. All of the others, essentially, are actors playing actors--lying and scheming for various reasons, at least one of which is presumably because they're the murderer--misleading the detective and us during their interviews and interactions. Much of this remains the case here, but it's complicated by Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), becoming the protagonist, the seeming dramatic irony of the early reveal, and her character's seeming inability to ""act,"" for she vomits whenever she lies.Turns out, in a sense, Harlan was right to be weary of his books being acted out, as he tries to write (indeed, he makes a written note of the plot of switched medications down during his final minutes) and stage his own death. Marta inevitably proves incapable of adapting or enacting his instructions, though. She's an ideal protagonist, however, as she cannot lie, and although she tries to withhold information from the detective, through flashbacks and other means, she never withholds from us, the spectator. The same can't be said of Blanc, or of other fictional detectives, for that matter. Even Craig's over-the-top accent--at one point, a crack is made that it's ""CSI: KFC""--marks him as actorly. (Personally, I couldn't help but think of Michael Scott from ""The Office"" saying ""There's been a murder in Savannah."") Not so with Marta, who also has a common and relatable backstory, of having an undocumented mother, of being self-made and hard-working in the face of the indignities thrown at her by Harlan's spoiled offspring. Although she's a nurse, in one scene, one of them hands her a dirty plate as though she were a maid, while he also barrages her with leading questions about illegal immigration, and as he and the rest confuse from what country she immigrated from. Both sides of the Tronmbey clan play out a parody of a left-right debate over immigration policy under the Trump administration, including a teenage son supposedly trolling alt-right vitriol on social media. They unite, however, upon their shared greed for an inheritance they feel entitled to, been born into and raised on.The irony of the murder mystery is even richer: that there wasn't even a murder at all until the writer, Harlan, wrote it and tried to help his suspect get away with it, as though she were a character from one of his books. He didn't count on a detective seemingly also straight from his prose--indeed, Blanc relates how his father knew Harlan--taking the case, though. All of these writerly and actorly characters play out the whodunit, as we honestly follow Marta, the only honest one of the bunch, trying to make sense of it all. Sure, there are clues, too. I especially appreciate how the mug, that piece of notepaper, and the business with knives come back in the end. But, solving the mystery is secondary here to merely enjoying the amusing, reflexive construction, with all the twists and turns. I was content to remain as informed or as ignorant as Marta to the end, to wait until Blanc inevitably gathers everyone together and explains everything.",Knives Out
50,gbill-74877,Fun and entertaining,8,29 February 2020,"""I spoke in the car about the hole at the center of this donut. And yes, what you and Harlan did that fateful night seems at first glance to fill that hole perfectly. A donut hole in the donut's hole. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that the donut hole has a hole in its center - it is not a donut hole at all, but a smaller donut with its own hole, and our donut is not a hole at all.""This is a fun and entertaining murder mystery, with a little dash of political subtext. Don't go in expecting grand sociopolitical commentary (go in ignorant, like me, haha), and I think you'll enjoy how these little elements were added. First and foremost, the focus of the film is on the unraveling of a mystery, which director Rian Johnson does in a skillful way. The pace is great and it's a strong cast, even if the film doesn't really allow any of them to stand out too much. Personally I loved seeing Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon amidst all the many others (Daniel Craig and his southern accent notwithstanding). The house and its furnishings are gorgeous, and the dialogue is sharply drawn. Despite having lots of characters and motivations, it finds a balance between immersing us gradually enough where we can keep track of who's who, and keeping things lively.As for the subtext, it's easy to think that the children and grandchildren of this wealthy mystery author stand for all wealthy Americans born with silver spoons in their mouths, but it may go further than that: they may stand for all Americans who feel a sense of entitlement to their birthright, and who have been spoiled by the fortunate situation they were born into. In other words, don't think that it's necessarily just a critique of the 1%. Regardless, I loved the different forms this took in the characters, and how in the end, even the more liberal or cool ones were out for themselves. It was also nice that through Don Johnson's character, we hear the other side of the argument, e.g. make immigrants do it legally, even if it's one I disagree with, since the process for immigrating legally is also under such attack. Whoops, I've veered off-topic for a film review, haven't I? Or maybe this is right on topic. Anyway, see the film if you're in the mood for something fun, it's a good one.",Knives Out

Knives Out stands out from most murder mystery movies of recent years in that its convoluted, twisting plot actually achieves something new, something most such movies haven't accomplished. It also smartly deviates from Murder on the Orient Express in important ways. While the plot is almost too complex, but necessarily so nowadays to be different, it also seems to resolve itself in a surprising, satisfying conclusion as the pieces of the puzzle begin to dribble in by the end as the audience gets to catch on too. Oddly enough, this murder mystery while both following the standard murder mystery outline, and doesn't quite have the same comedic horror template that another similar dysfunctional family element of Ready or Not (2019), Knives Out takes itself more seriously yet keeps it tone light throughout.

56,ironhorse_iv,Knives Out is cutting edge entertainment. Fun to watch.,8,3 October 2020,"In making a funny yet somewhat serious version of an Agatha Christie inspired murder mystery film out of a classic choose your adventure book; director and writer Rian Johnson might have saved his career after the disappointment of 2017 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. This current day 'whodunit' tells the story of detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) having to investigate a rich patriarch Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) death after his family gathering has gone awry. Without spoiling the movie too much, the look of the rural manor completed with its trick window and kitsch 'memento mori' props really do seem like a real-life Clue board. While the huge cast of unique characters that live there might be hard to keep track for certain people. The mystery was still mostly well told through them. The acting is mostly top notch, even if some of the accents were kinda cartoony jarring like the valley girl talk and the deep southern drawl. After all, performers like Craig can make a donut speech sound ridiculous yet sweet & compelling at the same time. You get a lot of interesting hints that Blanc knows more than what he is putting out there. After all, the game is afoot. There is also a lot of foreshadowing within the dialogue. Yet the twist and turns were delivered so shape that it was enough to put doubt in the audience members to second guess themselves in what was somewhat of a real predictable murder mystery outcome. I kinda like the 'Rashomon' flashback style editing. To add onto that, the way every one of the family was framed in the corner of a circler knives decoration while being interview by the police; signifies their wiliness to reach out to stab one another. It was a clever subtle way to show that each member is trying to do any means in order to inherited the estate. The family even try to act like they were the ones that treat Harlen's nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) as a close friend, yet most of them have no clue about her. I like how their body language expose their true colors subtlety regardless of their political views. They all wolves in sheep's clothing. In this case, thin wool sweaters. For example, one of them hands her his empty plate as if she was the help; while talking about the problems of the American immigration system without consorting her about the tense topic. The kin's basic indifference toward her is clearly evident in the later visuals as only Blanc and Marta were allowed to be framed center of the donut shape blade ornament. It's metaphoric shows how nearly all the characters have turned their attention toward them. With all the daggers facing toward the detective and the nurse. They have become the target. Another visual example of that is the scene where the camera goes from Steadicam movement to chaotic hand held with all the family ganging up on Marta. You really do feel the stressful pressure of the outside world caving in on her. Ana gave a really good emotionally devastating performance here. Yet there were some semi sinister oddities within her supposing good hearted character. One such example is her bizarre nursing practice. Even if you take away the vial mix up. The amount of ketorolac dosage she gives Harlan is supposed to be 60 mg and given more than a few days. Yet Marta gives him an irresponsibly large dose of 100 mg per day. Why is she risking him with renal failure? That's clearly a red flag. Call it inaccuracy, but it seems like earlier drafts might had Marta more in the grey area than the angelic status. That's not the only thing that doesn't make sense. If Harlan really wanted to make sure that his nurse wouldn't get in trouble. Why then, he doesn't commit suicide somewhere people can see him? After all, 911 was already dial. Even half a ring, the dispatcher would probably call back to make sure it's a medical emergency. People in the house would know sooner than later that something isn't right. His plan seemed very stupid as he created the very scenario he'd intended to avoid. Meanwhile, the motives of the real killer overly complicated murder scheme also seemed entirely counterproductive as staging a murder isn't really needed. One thing that the slayer rule doesn't do is negate a will or bring a defunct one back. Even if it did work, then Massachusetts would treat it as no will. Causing the assets to pass to Harlan's children. The individual would still be disinheritance. The only true way to fight it would prove omitted child statute; which means unless the family member is expressly disinherited in the will, or it can be proved that their omission wasn't an accident, that individual might then receive a portion of the probated estate. Seeing that Harlan appears to have simply drawn up the will himself and given it to his lawyer in a sealed envelope means it was not properly witnessed and could be easily legitimate challenged in court as the letter doesn't meet the standard of a codicil note. All the attempted murderer really had to do is look for legit loopholes after the funeral. Yet that person further ruin it by going back to the crime site and being spot. The antagonist only got lucky that the individual saw themselves too literally as the defender of the estate not to call the cops. Nevertheless, some of the events involving that seem a little too convenience. Yet it didn't take me out of the movie too much. The music by composer Nathan Johnson mostly kept me aboard. Even pop songs like Gordon Lightfoot's ""Sundown"" were well used. Overall: Unlike the 1973 novel 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon that Blanc mention. This movie is worth checking out. It's not all turgid & overwritten. It's mostly shaped like a knife. Worth a slice.",Knives Out
57,The-Sarkologist,A Fun Murder Mystery,7,12 December 2019,"From the poster of this film it sort of comes out that this is one of those overthetop type of murder mystery films that in a way remind me of Cleudo, though a part of me feels that Cleudo is a little more serious than this film. Serious it is not, but I didn't really find it all that funny either. However, from the title, you can probably work out what it is all about as well, namely a dysfunctional family fighting over who gets the patriarch's money.So, we have this author that has made lots, and lots of money from writing murder mysteries (and of course he writes murder mysteries - what other type of book would an author write when he is the focus of a murder mystery). It seems that he commited suicide, but this private detective is hired by an unknown person to sort of dig into what is going on a bit more.The film focuses around the nurse who became the patriarch's companion, and follows her through the mystery, and the reading of the will (which, of course, you are going to have as well), and the final solution. Personally, I don't want to give too much away because it does sort of spoil the mystery, and the plot certainly does twist and turn quite a lot during the film, which a well thought out murder mystery is supposed to do.Of course, everybody (or almost everybody) has a motive, though as was suggested, not enough to actually kill the old man. Yet you can sort of tell that this family is somewhat dysfunctional - money seems to always have that effect on people, especially if these people are all hoping to get a cut of pie once everything is said and done.Look, it is supposed to be a spoof, though it is a lot smarter than a lot of spoofs that have come out in the past, though it is a good thing that those really silly ones are no longer being made. Yet, I have to admit that I didn't necessarily find it all that funny, though a part of me feels that maybe it is just the eccentricities of the characters that is supposed to make this film interesting. In the end, it was fun, but not one that really grabbed me.",Knives Out

Oh how this guy loves subverting expectations!!It's hard to say if I liked it or not, as I was disappointed to not get the all star, murder mystery ensemble I had been promised in the trailers, but I did enjoy what I got though, and I laughed a few times. I'd say it's a thriller more than a murder mystery. Oh and it has a political message too!! They are not subtle undertones, they hit you over the head with it.All of the big stars have don't have that much screen time, Daniel Craig probably has the most, whilst Jamie Lee Curtis has the least, Ana de Armas gets the most screen time, and she is hardly in the trailers.The cast are all having fun in their roles and its hard not to enjoy yourself when they are in screen, but I'd have to say Ana De Armas is the best one here.I can't get into what I didn't like too much without going into spoilers etc, but all in all I enjoyed it for what it was, instead of hating it for what it wasn't.",Knives Out

From his children to his devoted staff everyone is a suspect.I enjoyed this movie very much because it was very interesting and had many great scenes. I also liked very much the plot and how it changed through time and the combination between plot twists and comedy made this movie even more interesting. The interpretations of Daniel Craig who played as Benoit Blanc, Ana de Armas who played as Marta Cabrera, Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Linda Drysdale and Chris Evans who played as Ransom Drysdale were simply amazing.Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Christopher Plummer's who played as Harlan Thrombey, LaKeith Stanfield's who played as Lieutenant Elliott and Michael Shannon's who played as Walt Thrombey. Finally, the direction which was made by Rian Johnson who is also the writer of this movie was very good and his hard work was obvious in the whole duration of the film.",Knives Out

This kind of film reminds me like Murder at the Orient Express. But a little more fun and entertaining. Rian Johnson direction and his witty script makes this movie worth watching. It is fun, there are surprises, and twist and turns.The plot follows Harlan (Christopher Plummer) who is a patriarch and owns a lot. After he was mysteriously found dead and presumed it was a suicide. A private investigator Benoit Blanc is hired to solve the mystery. With the family being on the will and are wanting their share of Harlan's property and company. Blanc believes there is a suspect that is at large within the family.The film's plot is a little slow moving. It is a lot of fun.

Meg (Katherine Langford). Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Joni (Toni Collette). And their house nanny Marta (Ana de Armas). The cast ensemble was great. The performances are fun and entertaining.The film is filled with surprises with twist and turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it.

As a film it has quite good as expected although may be slightly overrated at certain aspects. For a mystery film, the length works as it was drawn out and features an ensemble cast. However much of the cast seemed to be underused. The end reveal was fascinatingly done but somewhat predictable- in terms of who did it and why.Overall Knives Out is as good as some may consider, and most definitely a film which will be remembered many decades from now.Also considering a sequel is in the works. The expectations for this follow up will be very high and we all hope they live up to it. There are many possibilities and ideas as to what it will center on.

64,eddie_baggins,A Fun but Forgettable Whodunit,7,28 November 2019,"To put it mildly, director Rian Johnson's experience behind the camera last time around was a highly interesting and career defining one.Charged with taking over the new Star Wars saga in the form of the hotly debated The Last Jedi, Johnson found himself victim of countless online trolls, critics and universe obsessed fanboys, as his franchise turning feature found itself scrutinized like very few films do.With its issues, The Last Jedi was still a film with some great moments and interesting ideas and the man who gave us Brick and Looper has always been a fine filmmaker with runs on the board, so it's great to see the keen aficionado of mystery and whodunits deliver an enjoyable and fun romp without any pre-conceived constraints holding him back.Knives Out is the type of mystery film of old, filled with a rag-tag collection of characters and possible suspects as Johnson builds off the foundation of authors such as Agatha Christie and filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, to concoct an extremely well-written and acted film that is sure to insight much fandom moving forward.It's not a film of much lasting substance, despite some already looking to deep into its underlying political themes born out of the Trump era, but Johnson and his cast are just having an old-fashioned good time here as Daniel Craig's ""KFC"" southern detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas's (Brazilian, Ecuadorian or other various countries of origin) nurse Marta Cabrera team up to uncover the mystery of author Harlan Thromby's untimely demise.With Craig on top form here and going the whole nine yards and de Armas continuing to prove to us all she could well be the ""next big thing"", Knives Out is a joy to watch whenever they get too command the screen and surrounded by one of 2019's best ensembles, that is highlighted by an against type Chris Evans going to the dark side with his loathsome Ransom Drysdale and Michael Shannon dialing it back as Thromby's son Walt, Knives Out is always watchable.It's a shame Johnson included one too many characters into his film though, as not all of the supports feel that needful to the story, particularly Jaeden Martell's teenage internet troll (regardless of what Johnson intended, this feels like a character getting a say at the Star Wars keyboard warriors) and Katherine Langford's granddaughter Meg, these type of characters feel like mere wallpaper in a film that shines best when focusing on its best components which remains throughout de Armas and the usually gruff Craig.The other slightly disappointing aspect to this murder mystery is the fact that its final pay-off doesn't exactly come off as much of a surprise and at over two hours, it would've been nice to have felt more rewarded with a genuinely mind-blowing reveal, but they're high expectations born from a film with a great premise and some lovingly staged ideas.Final Say -A fun statement from a director who seemingly had the world against him with his last film, Knives Out is a well-played whodunit and while the film doesn't quite stick the landing, there's much to enjoy leading up to it thanks to some great central turns and whip smart script work.3 1/2 doughnut holes out of 5",Knives Out

66,leonblackwood,Exptected more! 6/10,6,2 September 2020,"Review:
Although the cast is pretty amazing, I did find this film to be a pretty average ""whodunnit"", which is a shame because it started off pretty well. Once the main character, Marta (Ana de Armas) reveals the true story behind the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), I didn't really see the point of the film, and it seemed to go round and round in circles, which I found pretty annoying. It's obvious that there was more to the plot because of how early the ""suspense"" element goes straight out of the window, and I knew that Chris Evans (Ransom) would play a big part in the conspiracy because he is one of the biggest names in the cast. As for Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), he certainly wasn't in the same league as Sherlock Holmes or Poirot, especially with that weird Southern accent, but he produced a touch of genius towards the end, which saved the film. Like most Agatha Christie type movies, everyone is a suspect, and one of the fun and amusing aspects of this film is the interrogation of the suspects at the very beginning, but even that was short-lived. I did like the chemistry between Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas towards the end, and all of the family members in the house put in a great performance, which is why I was expecting more from the film. You do end up sticking with the plot because your expecting something amazing to happen, which it kind of does towards the end, but it's isn't memorable. It just seemed like an episode of Quincy with some fancy actors. Anyway, I personally think that it's only worth a one watch because once the plot is revealed, I cant see people rushing to see it again. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Rian Johnson, who also brought you Brick in 2005, The Brothers Bloom, Looper, 3 episodes of Breaking Bad and the Last Jedi. It's been announced that there will be a Knives Out 2, after the profit that this movie made, so with Daniel Craig not playing Bond anymore, I'm sure that he will step up to the plate to play Benoit Blanc once again. Although I found this film to be overrated, I still think that it's cleverly pieced together towards the end, but not that surprising. And what was it with the whole doughnut analogies? Anyway, I got the moral of the story, that good always outdoes the 7 sins, but I still thought it was slow and predictable in places.Budget: $40million

71,digitalbeachbum,"Not bad, but it has mistakes",7,24 February 2020,"Knives Out is a murder mystery, much like Clue or Murder on the Orient Express. It is light, minimal violence and minimal language. No nudity. No serious blood. Not for the little ones.I'm critical of all movies except comedies. I give them a bit more slack when it comes to mistakes. However, when it comes to murder mystery movies I'm deadly serious about my nit picking.I won't bother with the problems I found in the movie, because I finally found a movie I enjoyed. A rarity in today's society of stupid, reboots and plastic filler movies, written for the people who do not care about quality.With Knives Out, I forgot I was in a movie theatre and that is rare for a movie to do to me. I became entranced by the characters and the story that I drifted from reality in to a different world. That is what movies should do for the viewer. That is why going to a movie theatre is so special and a great social experience.When we left the movie, all we could talk about was ""did you know who did it"" and ""when did you figure it out"". Some other questions were about being confused or thrown off the scent of the killer. We also asked about the various characters and scenes which we thought had some hidden clues.I had narrowed down the list to two people in the start of the movie, but by the middle of the movie I knew already who had done it.I'm shocked that this was by Rian Johnson. After the Star Wars cluster that was out I thought I would never wanted to go see any movie connected with him, but I'm glad I didn't know he wrote, directed and produced this movie. I would have missed out on a great experience.Overall the movie was not perfect. It has some serious mistakes in the plot and technical details. However, if you look past those errors the movie is extremely enjoyable. The characters are colorful, the setting in the old house with all the odd and strange items, making you realise the eccentric nature of the patriarch.I want to give it an 8 but it doesn't deserve it.

75,southdavid,"""I Might Be Wrong""",7,3 December 2019,"Really enjoyable, if slightly overpraised (at the moment) for my money, murder mystery from Rian Johnson.Acclaimed author Harlan Thromby (Christopher Plummer) dies on the night of his birthday party at his stately home. Though seemingly suicide, the celebrated amateur detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) believes it may be something more sinister - particularly when he learns that Thromby has recently been putting his estate in order, which would prove costly for his lazy ruthless trust-fund family.There's an awful lot to like about ""Knives Out"". It's an all-star cast, and the performances generally live up to that billing; even if, rather by the necessity of time, some of them don't feature very much. The script is also very funny, with several laugh out loud lines - though I wouldn't go as far as calling ""Knives Out"" a comedy and definitely not a parody of a ""whodunit"". I do like to see a murder mystery on the big screen again, as a genre it's rather fallen out of favour, or been resigned to the television - I don't think we've had a big screen one since ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Once you get used to Daniel Craig's accent, it's easier to warm to the character (in fact I'd like to see another Benoit Blanc mystery at some point in the future).One criticism is true of the genre, rather than specifically this film. Given that I now know what happened that night, I don't think I'm going to need to see the film again any time soon, if ever. There isn't much replay value to it.Specific to this film though, at its conclusion I felt like I wanted more. There are a number of twists, but they revolve around the characters that we're left with and I think I'd have preferred a cleverer version that involved a few more of the rest of the family in some capacity. I do accept that this is a delicate balancing act though, and too many twists for the sake of it might have driven the film into farce.That said, for the two hours you're in the cinema with ""Knives Out"" it's a great time.",Knives Out
76,Vartiainen,Old fashioned murder mystery with a twist,8,12 January 2020,"Directed by Rian Johnson, Knives Out is a very stylish, very classical murder mystery. A whodunit story, following in the footsteps of Agatha Christie and other masters.This is most apparent in style and the visuals. The head of a family is dead and the family is gathering together to bury him and to settle such minor questions as inheritance and what really happened to grandfather. And obviously a gentleman detective just happens to turn up, ready to help. A premise straight from a Christie book. And the manour itself is also gloriously weird, filled with odd angles, bizarre knickknacks, scary mementos and enough Baroque aesthetic to make you fear the dark.However, while it is clear Johnson obviously loves this genre and wants to do it justice, he's not content simply rehashing old tropes and doing them correctly. He wants to take the genre forward, do something different with it. Innovate. And he succeeds. The film can be called a whodunit, but that's not entirely accurate, at least not the whole way through. Can't really say more about that without spoilers, but suffice to say the film has a few surprises in store for you.It's also brilliantly acted, benefiting from an ensemble cast of actors. A couple who stand out are Daniel Craig as the gentleman detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera, nurse of the late head of family and the supposed main character of the film. But all the actors are great. True, there are a couple of characters that don't get much screen time, making them rather one note, but that's the price of telling the story, I suppose.Knives Out is what happens when someone takes something he really loves, but not so much that he's unwilling to see it change.

78,paul-allaer,It's okay but I don't understand the hype,5,16 December 2019,"""Knives Out"" (2019 release; 130 min.) looks at the demise of Harlan Thrombey, the 85 yr. old patriarch and successful novelist. As the movie opens, the housekeeper finds him dead on a couch, an apparent suicide. We then go to ""One Week After the Demise of Harlan Thrombey"", as the police have gathered several people for interrogating them as to what exactly has happened, including Marta, the nurse caretaker, Linda, the patriarch's daughter, and Richard, Linda's husband. We soon are introduced to yet more central characters... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Rian Johnson, best known for directing the 2017 ""Star Wars - Tee Last Jedi"". Here he brings us a murder mystery in line with those ""who dunnit"" mysteries from Agatha Christie and the like. Much of the movie takes place in the patriarch's Massachusetts house and in that sense the movie feels very much like a theater plat at times. It takes a nit of work to fully understand who is who and who may have done what. All if it is tied together by Daniel Craig's character, a private investigator who was hired by someone in the family (but we don't know who). I am not spoiling anything when I say that it is absolutely impossible to figure out who the true culprit(s) is/are, so you just sit back and wait for the last 20 min. or so when all is revealed. Marts is played by rapidly riding Cuban actress Ana de Armas, whom we also saw in ""Yesterday"" not long ago, and will seemingly be everywhere in 2020. Jamie Lee Curties has a second-tier role as Linda, as does Don Johnson as Richard. And Christopher Plummer has an even smaller role as the patriarch. Please note that the movie's title is indeed taken from the Radiohead song of the same name (Rian Johnson being a huge Radiohead fan), but that's where the connection stops (the Radiohead song does not play in the movie).""Knives Out"" premiered at this Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to positive reaction and opened wide in late November. The movie has performed much better than expected at the box office, being a genuine box office hit, and it is currently also rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I really didn't plan on seeing this but seeing those numbers and sky-high ratings made me change my mind. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (a good 30 people in a small theater). After all this, I'm sorry, but am I missing something? I mean, sure, this is a pleasant divertisment, nothing less, nothing more (for me anyway). But this is just okay and nowhere near as good as a bunch of other films I have seen this year (Apollo 11, The Mustang, The Lighthouse, The Report, The Two Popes, The Irishman, The Peanut Butter Falcon, Parasite, Waves, Richard Jewell, etc.). Of course I encourage you to check it our, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Knives Out

80,jtindahouse,"Wickedly smart, with characters and performances to match",10,4 December 2019,"There are so many things I love about 'Knives Out', but possibly the one I love most is that it proves if your story is strong enough then you don't need gratuitous action sequences to pad the run time and keep the audience entertained. 'Knives Out' has one brief car chase that doesn't have a lot put into it (even the characters reference what a terrible car chase it is) and that's it. The rest of the movie is just the story unfolding. And yet it is so gripping that it is one of the best paced films of 2019.The cast in this movie is incredible. It is all-star and everyone in it plays their parts perfectly. I have to give special mention to Daniel Craig though. I haven't often liked Craig's performances outside of the 'Bond' series, but here he is truly fantastic. The accent he chose to go with took a little adjusting to, but by the end of the movie I couldn't imagine his character without it. He was a pleasure to watch on screen.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Every detail is laid out masterfully. It's a movie you could watch 100 times and you'd still be picking up on new things.

81,Turfseer,Standard update of Agatha Christie-like murder mystery featuring solid performances by an all-star cast,6,8 December 2019,"Writer/Director Rian Johnson is best known for his last 2017 effort, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" which did very well on both Metacritic (85%) and Rotten Tomatoes (91%). Less successful in my opinion was Johnson's 2012 Looper, which was quite successful at the box office but featured a rather convoluted sci-fi narrative that didn't work very well. Here with Knives Out, he's decided to channel Agatha Christie, in a contemporary murder mystery with an all-star cast.
Knives Out is virtually ""all plot"" with stock character types typical of the genre. Case in point is the main character, private detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig who sports a notable southern accent. Craig does well in the part but just about any other marquee star could have taken on the role and done an equally decent job as Craig.
As the story unfolds, Blanc is called into investigate the murder of famed mystery writer, Harlan Thrombey (winningly played by Christopher Plummer), following his 85th birthday party celebration at the Thrombey mansion.
The quirky family members all soon learn they've been cut out of Harlan's will. They include Harlan's daughter: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), a real estate mogul initially bankrolled by her father; her husband Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's son-in-law, who's having an affair which Harlan was about to expose, and Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), an arrogant, spoiled playboy who proves to be the principal antagonist.
Also in mix are: Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), Harlan's youngest son who runs his publishing empire; Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette), Harlan's daughter-in-law, who was married to Harlan's deceased son Neil; and Meg Thrombey, Joni's daughter (Katherine Langford). There are other characters here, mostly too numerous to list.
The other principal character is Harlan's nurse and caretaker, Marta Cabrera (a very solid Ana de Armas) who is implicated in Harlan's murder after she accidentally gives him a fatal dose of morphine. Instead of rehashing the plot, suffice it to say Johnson wisely keeps us guessing for a while as to who is responsible for Harlan's death.
The actual circumstances of the murder are well thought out, as Marta actually gives him the correct dose of medication through instinct but then comes to believe otherwise after the murderer switches labels on the bottle. Later it's revealed through a toxicology report that Harlan did not receive a fatal overdose, but following Marta's unintentional but false confession to him that she mistakenly gave him the wrong dose, he promptly commits suicide by slashing his throat.
The rest of Knives Out involves only a modicum of suspense with Blanc following Marta around the mansion (upon his orders), as she continues to dispose of any clues that might implicate her.
The basic problem with the narrative once we break into the Second Act (SPOILERS AHEAD) is that the most unsavory character here turns out to be the prime suspect and ultimately the guilty party. Without revealing who that character is, I can only say that I was expecting a little bit more of a twist ending, given the already evident presence of such an unsavory antagonist.
The question remains, do we need another one of these updated Agatha Christie-like murder mysteries? I say, why not? This one, however, is rather standard but it does contain a few moments of suspense coupled with solid performances all-around, from an all-star cast.",Knives Out

This is overtly political, and by ""overtly"" I mean that they are screaming through a megaphone, at just about every opportunity, to inject their politics into it.Other than that, it is kind of like Clue... if Clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes, and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice. And that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so self-aware they can't help but fail.So, basically that is what you are getting, Clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics. And that is all you are getting.But, hey, if you haven't seen Clue, you might like it. And, if you share the politics and think they should be shrieked in everything, you will totally like it.The rest of us are just going to watch Clue.",Knives Out
84,stevendbeard,In The Vein Of Murder On The Orient Express,8,28 November 2019,"I saw ""Knives Out"", starring Daniel Craig-the James Bond movies, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo_2011; Chris Evans-the Captain America & Avengers movies, the Fantastic Four movies; Jamie Lee Curtis-the Halloween movies, Christmas With the Kranks; Don Johnson-Django Unchained, Machete; Christopher Plummer-The Man Who Invented Christmas, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_2011 and Ana de Armas-Blade Runner 2049, War Dogs.
This is a murder mystery in the vein of Murder on the Orient Express-it has a lot of celebrities in it. Christopher plays the eccentric millionaire-among other things, he has a chair with knives all over it, looking like it was from Game of Thrones-and he is celebrating his 85th birthday with the whole family coming in for it. Jamie is his daughter, Don is her husband and Chris is their son. There are other family members-and they are all dysfunctional-and Ana is the care giver to Christopher. Ana seems to be the only one that really likes Christopher. During the night, Christopher is found dead-his throat slit with a knife-and it is ruled a suicide. After the funeral, the police show up at the family home with Daniel-a private investigator-and start asking questions. It seems that it might not have been suicide but maybe murder, instead. Everyone is a suspect with a motive.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language, drug material and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Knives Out

The storyline tells the tale of murder one detective is determined to solve and a family is trying to hide...at least someone is.

This movie is directed by Rian Johnson (Looper) and stars Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), Chris Evans (Avengers), Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween), LaKeith Stanfield (Selma), Don Johnson (Miami Vice) and Michael Shannon (Mud). The storyline for this is very well written and I loved how it intertwined the characters, their backstories and characteristics. The cast is perfectly selected and everyone delivers their character perfectly. There was great chemistry between each character and I loved the writing and dialogue.

87,drqshadow-reviews,"A Wonderfully Stylish, Unpredictable Bit of Essential Murder Mystery... Until it Runs Out of Nerve",8,28 January 2020,"Rian Johnson writes and directs this wickedly pointy ensemble murder mystery, which finds a large, snobby family at odds over the untimely demise of their allegedly-beloved patriarch and the impending redistribution of his wealth.The first hour is a particularly brilliant bit of deceptive filmmaking, shifting from one unreliably-narrated flashback to the next, while the audience is left to make sense of all the lies and half-truths. Eccentric to the last, each member of this extended family has something to hide, a personal scandal or ulterior motive, and that's conveniently left out of their fond memories with the deceased. Though it's burdened with such a heavy cast, none feel extraneous or fade into the woodwork. They're each distinct and memorable, even if a few of the actors take things a bit over the top and flirt with parody. Daniel Craig might be the loudest such example, constantly over-playing his best Foghorn Leghorn accent, but he's got plenty of competition. Like a high-expense party game, most everybody has a gimmick. Some just work it a bit harder than the others.When it's on-point, Knives Out delights in toying with perception and reality, sharing the same events from multiple, highly biased, perspectives. It falters on the home stretch, though, dropping the cloak and dagger in favor of a rather blunt, linear final act. That's disappointing, but not crippling. Even with the limp climax, this is a quirky, amusing, well-composed mystery. Just seemed like it was on the fast-track to something more.",Knives Out

Meanwhile famed detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought on the case by a mysterious employer to untangle things.Clue anyone? Performances by all the suspects are arch and played for laughs but not many materialize. They are simply en masse a greedy, unctuous family offering broad performances and cringing personalities while Craigs corn porn accent grills suspects with marbles in his mouth.Rian Johnson's direction is anemic as he relies on guilty expressions in wide angle to advance his predictable plot that attempts to have two mysteries (one to clear our heroine, one to find the real culprit ) hanging in the balance and both are torpidly pursued.The real star is ultimately the mansion and its incredible interior of furniture, secret passages and fantastic wall paper that gives the film a Gothic mystery feel.

Ana De Armas plays the lead in this film and she did a really good job in this film, she is really likeable and you truly care about her character. She is our view into this crazy situation and she is easily the relatable character of the film. Daniel Craig plays the main detective in the film and he does a great job, he plays the detective very well and he is a very interesting character in this film. Jaime Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon & Chris Evans play members of the family and they all do great jobs in the film, they all play there characters very well and they are full of intrigue and mystery. The story has tonnes of twists and turns which really works for the is film, it does keep you thinking, however, I do believe that the reveal is a bit easy to predict which I did but that is literally the only negative I can find with this film. The script is great, a truly fantastic mix of humour and drama, I was laughing when I was meant too and I was feeling the emotion when required.

90,CubsandCulture,By far and away the best film of 2019,10,12 January 2020,"Using the form of the whodunit Johnson's crafts a black comedy that it is at once a startling deconstuction of the genre and a reconstruction of the same to make a political parable about entitlement and just desserts. It is exceptionally difficult to explain the brilliance of this film without spoilers but the more you think you know what is going on or who is the bad person is the more the film will trick you. There is a central moment of the film that depends on an *extremely* clever use of expectations molding perceptions to hide what is going on and it is the single greatest moment in cinema this year. The script is a masterwork of layered meaning, jokes and characterizations. Simply word choice reveals so much-for a benign example the family's cruelty and indifference towards Marta is revealed in that none of them get the country she is from correct. There are roughly a dozen characters in this film and you feel as if you come to know all of them. And as meta as the film gets it is no mere shell game of playing around with tropes. The film at its core is discussing the ways in which race, material wealth breed resentment and cruelty. The final shot is a massive rebuke of Trumpianism and the film is like a dagger to the heart of some of the worst people in our society; this is a social satire of the first order. The shade of the final moment is thrown in righteous anger. It is simply great.Johnson, as a director, never lets the film dwell on its political import. Indeed, visually the film is an exceptionally crafted mood piece that combines classic compositions and style to create an atmosphere that is simply fun. You can almost feel Johnson robbing his hands together in delight. The visual construct is as clever as the writing in places. Each supports the other to such a degree that the film feels formed directly from Johnson's mind. The circle of knives is not only a striking central visual but it is part of the fun. It just looks cool and means something. This is a film that has a lot on its mind but finds its delights in delighting its viewers.And I have not even mentioned the best part. The acting is gobsmacking perfect. The entire cast is just so good in this. They all deftly blend the comedic and mystery elements. They hide the red herrings well. They all are having so much fun. It is unfair to select any one performance but de Armas is perfect in this. She makes a weird quirk believable. She is tough as nails, smart as a whip and vulnerable. Evans plays against type to a wonderful effect. Oh and Daniel Craig's Blanc is the funniest most endearing detective in about 30 years.I am so glad I decided to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt and see this!",Knives Out

Mysterious detective Benoit Blanc is enlisted to investigate, but when he discovers that several parties within Harlan's family may have motives to 'off' the old man cracking the case may not quite be so straight-forward...With its quirky old-fashioned mystery approach and a wonderful cast Knives Out is a fun evening in front of the telly. It's old-fashioned approach is one of its biggest strengths; the film repeatedly flits backwards and forwards and although it is quite a long film it's nicely structured and very well pieced together.The cast are all really good and whether they are part of the main cast or the supporting cast everyone plays their part in making this film enjoyable (I couldn't find one weak link within the film tbh). The direction is crisp and assured and the location for the Thrombey home is ideal (one character reflected that it's like the set of Clue which is exactly what I thought).Although the perpetrator may not surprise everyone, the clever way that the conclusion is reached does still mean that there are 1 or 2 surprises in store. Knives Out is a murder/mystery come black-comedy meaning that there are some amusing moments dotted throughout the film.If I'm to be critical then I would say that the film is perhaps a tad on the long side (things do sag a bit in the middle), but aside from that Knives Out is a fairly entertaining puzzler.",Knives Out

I had a great time laughing at Daniel Craig's accent and even better at the rich white liberals proving that they only uphold liberalism ideas when it fits their agenda and their self-entitlement. Not to mention Toni Collette's character is everything and you can't imagine how refreshing it is to see ChrisEdit: Evans acting so unlike Steve Rogers. Delightful treat.

It's a brilliant 131 minutes, even if it feels much shorter than that given how enjoyable it is.The casting is impeccable. Daniel Craig is superb in the role of Blanc, I've actually found Craig a tad hit-and-miss - even with 'James Bond' - but he is utterly superb here; even with that unusual yet definitely entertaining accent.It's by no means The Craig Show, though. Ana de Armas is excellent as Marta, she does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making her character's situation fully believable. She's great from start-to-finish.Michael Shannon is top notch too, I literally always find him fun to watch - from 'Boardwalk Empire' to, even, 'Kangaroo Jack'. Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield and Christopher Plummer are all fantastic too.The plot is enthralling, it's crafted together expertly. It reveals bits way earlier than I was predicting, which made me worry it was going to all fall flat at any moment but it kept turning out to be the perfect time to twist the story.

From the crazy & dysfunctional family & his devoted staff, Blanc has to sift through a huge web of red herrings & self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's death. Each actor brings so much richness & detail to their character, it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking in my opinion with a truly stunning setting with the massive mansion setting that is just beautiful, old looking & richly detailed & a place you would want to explore, the look of this movie is gorgeous too with a lovely cozy look & set during the Autumn & simply lovely cinematography. The real knockout performance here is from the beautiful Ana De Armas, this lady is truly a phenomenal actor who really carries to the whole movie & interacts with everyone of the huge ensemble cast of characters & holds it all together perfectly, her performance is fantastic as she struggles to help others & keep secrets & its a great performance. I was also really impressed by Chris Evans as he's moved onto such a different role than what we know him as (Captain America) & it's a fun part from a guy who is only really known for his Marvel movies work, he's a great actor here. This is also the best I've seen Daniel Craig in a film, he's excellent here as the smart Colombo type Detective with a deep southern accent, another great performance. Jamie Lee Curtis is another legend of Cinema & as usual she's great here & alot of fun, always been a Jamie lee Curtis fan since i grew up watching the Halloween films & The Fog.

100,kluseba,Old-fashioned murder-mystery thriller executed with wit,8,29 November 2019,"Knives Out is a murder-mystery movie in the key of old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Edgar Wallace novels and their cinematic adaptations throughout the sixties and seventies of the last century. This sounds worse than it is because a movie without an overdose of special effects that goes back to the basics is actually quite refreshing. Elderly audiences will adore this movie and it might as well introduce younger audiences to this almost forgotten type of cinema.This thriller works well for numerous reasons. The actors and actresses are veterans and talented youngster who complement one another perfectly. Young Cuban actress Ana de Armas delivers the goods as good-hearted caretaker who ends up mingled in a crime. Veteran Christopher Plummer is excellent as eccentric author who despises his own family. The diversified Daniel Craig convinces as mysterious investigator who tries to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.The locations and settings are simple but very efficient in this movie. Most parts of the film take place in a gorgeous mansion and even though the architecture and landscapes look splendid, the tight rooms and sinister decorations give the film a gloomy vibe. The few scenes that are filmed away from that location offer some refreshing diversity in form of small appartments, charming downtown areas and rural restaurants.The plot obviously comes around with a few twists and turns. However, those don't come as big surprises if you are familiar with this type of storytelling. Another minor issue is that too many details are revealed rather quickly through flashbacks. This movie would have been even better if it had given its audience the time and occasion to come to its own conclusions and put the pieces of the puzzle together.Still, Knives Out offers one hundred thirty minutes of old-fashioned but well-executed murder-mystery entertainment and convinces thanks to a solid plot, great locations and gifted actresses and actors. In addition to this, this film also offers some soial criticism by pointing out the egoism, greed and manipulation of the rich and the famous. If you want to know what kind of movies your parents or grand-parents enjoyed when they were younger, give this film a fair chance. Sometimes, going back to basics means advancing in the right direction.",Knives Out

Everything is on the screen :the family feud ,the patriarch who rules over them ,whose will is the bone of contention ;the house ,an enclosed place where everyone has a motive to do away with sweet grandpa; the clichéed characters , with actors overplaying and making a brilliant use of cliché ;the screenplay even allows itself the luxury of revealing who cut the tycoon's throat long before the end.
And what about Hercule Poirot? He is present ,in the shape of Benoit Blanc (=White), a famous detective with a French (or Belgian more like)name , who will not even have to gather the whole family (a Christie recurrent feature) when he reveals the whole truth ;even Lady Agatha is here, in the shape of the centenarian millionaire's mom ,watching the detective, in a way ,her hero -she killed in her ""curtain"" book-

Yes, the performances are great, perfectly fitting the over the top nature of the movie, with Evans really throwing some charisma around. Aside from that it's beautifully shot, well directed and the mystery actually makes sense and you believe the investigators are legitimately working things out rather than just knowing things because the plot demands it.The tone of this may be the biggest hang up some have with it. It's part legit whodunnit and part commentary on the genre. It ends up being to mysteries what Cabin in the Woods was to horror, a great example and indictment of the genre all in one If you have a hard time getting on that track, this one may miss at times.

To begin with the large cast of actors in the film, the biggest standouts include the obviously fantastic performance from Daniel Craig as Detective Blank, Chris Evans as Ransom, Christopher Plummer as Harlan, and the surprisingly show stealing Ana de Arma as Marta- Harlan's nurse. The film decides to stay away from the traditional sense and plot lines of murder mystery stories, and goes for an unexpected route that proves to as equally interesting as it is incredibly entertaining. Rian Johnson shines yet again, returning to his original filmwork brighter and better than before, and not letting the hate of Last Jedi (even though personally I didn't mind it too much), affect him and his work in any sort of way. The film is masterly crafted and is filled so many twists and turns that you truly won't know what's coming next. Making for one of the most original and smart films of the year, Knives Out is not only a bloody good time, but a clever, compelling, and well made one as well; proving yet again there is plenty of new stories still worth telling.

But as noted in, ironically, another review featuring Michael Shannon (THE SHAPE OF WATER): Antagonists are no longer people who do bad things, but simply, bad people...From one pivotal argument concerning illegal aliens breaking the laws of American-only America, the already obvious message of KNIVES OUT becomes far too clear, and the aforementioned cast merely serves to back up the most heated side of that debate, hardly having anything to do with the Mystery at hand or fleshing out their roles in it...Only Daniel Craig, as a cocky Southern private-detective, and Ana de Armas, as dead millionaire Mystery writer Christopher Plummer's trusted nurse and household maid, have anything to do with how things not only pan out but... following Craig's overlong ""finally explaining the murder"" diatribe... ultimately turn out...That's if you don't include the entire third-act finally providing Chris Evans his second-star status; he begins a sort of likeable anti-rich rich jerk who eventually provides the preachy agenda even more unbearably preachy wordplay...And one of the most banal plot-points involves the maid's reaction to lying, making an extremely important character even more of an agenda with a pulse. And hardly even that. Ana de Armas is merely a pair of pretty pouty-lips here... Leaving the best character to be the least important...LaKeith Stanfield plays a local detective who would have failed at solving the case had the quirky Daniel Craig not been hired, and his job here is to ground a possible crime that writer/director Rian Johnson seems to have created to reshape/end all Cinematic Mysteries... But unlike this down-to-earth lawman, KNIVES OUT needs some serious grounding.""Why was I hired?"" Craig's Benoit Blanc desperately asks Stanfield's Lieutenant Elliott. Probably the most logical question raised all along. And like so much else here, without either a logical or halfway satisfying answer/conclusion.",Knives Out
111,AudioFileZ,"Smart Little Play On Deceit, Greed, & Murder",8,15 February 2020,This will be my shortest review in simple terms. A quirky whodunnit story in a mansion with an entire family each having their own motives. It gives and takes what the story wants you to think to come around to a sweet ending.

It's also surprisingly extremely funny and expertly paced. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic.",Knives Out
113,davidmvining,Entertaining Whodunnit,7,17 January 2020,"This reminds me a lot of The Prestige. Not so much in storytelling (though there are some similarities), but in terms of how a director made a very financially successful film and followed it up with something much smaller as a way to recharge his batteries. It's clever, witty, and fun, but it's more of a way for Rian Johnson to stretch his creative legs than anything else. Still, it's a good time at the movies.A lot got made of the film's early reveal of the central death, and it does provide a certain level of uncertainty as the film moves beyond it. It feels like there's no more of the mystery to explore for a long stretch, and we're left with our main character, Marta, as she navigates the mess she suddenly finds herself in. It's gonna be hard to talk about this movie without spoilers, so I'll actually give a warning. Skip to the final paragraph to skip the spoilers.So, Marta is Harlan Thrombey's nurse. He is the patriarch of a screwed up family allowed to be screwed up because of his financial success bred from a long series of detective and mystery novels (one of which is titled around knives, hence the circle of knives that features prominently in the marketing). The night of his 85th birthday, when his whole family came to visit, Marta accidentally gives Harlan 100mg of morphine. Knowing what she's done and unable to find the drug to counteract the morphine, she explains to Harlan that he's going to die in the next ten minutes. Harlan, seeing his impending death, the guilt that will be placed on Marta, knowledge of what he's done with his will recently, and desirous of keeping his family away from their inheritance completely, decides that he's going to cut his own throat, making his death an obvious suicide.Marta helped stage the scene as well, breaking back into the house to help clean up, but she left a trail of evidence that she never noticed and only becomes aware of as she walks with private detective Benoit Blanc through the scene. She's guilty of killing Harlan, but it was an accident. It was also obvious that Harlan liked her better than he liked any of his children. We end up liking her because of her innocence and her inability to lie (leading her to vomit every time that she tries), and as a contrast to the hornet's nest that is Harlan's family.Everyone hates everyone else. There are affairs, thefts, lack of ambition, and general unpleasantness all around. Harlan had bred a group of ungrateful loafs when he had thought that he was raising men and women who would build their own legacies as he had. He wants to cut them off for their own good. However, he told his grandson Ransom too early. This is where the twists actually begin to pile up. Ransom switched the medication in Marta's bag, so Marta hadn't actually poisoned Harlan and he had just killed himself. Ransom gets tricked into admitting it in front of the police (complete with Marta lying and holding in the vomit just long enough).The movie is clever. It tries to convince you early that you know the twists and that you're just going to follow the main character through the investigation that just won't stop because of the doggedness of Benoit Blanc, but it leaves more twists to come while providing enough time between to focus on Marta and her troubles to act as a convincing red herring while also creating enough character work to make people that we can invest in. There's a whole host of activity going on including a coroner's report, the housemaid, and a security videotape. Marta's journey through the morass of the family out to get her after they discover that Harlan left her everything in the will and Blanc's tireless pursuit of the truth moves through the family, eventually settling on Ransom as an unlikely ally.Ultimately, I found it entertaining but a bit thin. There is an idea about heritage and inheritance that runs through the film, but it seems small compared to the movements back and forth with the plot. Marta's likeable while the rest of the family are different degrees of awful. It's twisty and turny, keeping you guessing, and leaves satisfyingly. It's a nice time at the movies. I just hope that Johnson doesn't become solely dedicated to more films in this nascent series. It was amusing, but he could be doing more.",Knives Out
114,jadepietro,A Sharp Send-up to the Whodunnit Done Well,8,24 November 2019,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An highly entertaining murder mystery that harks back to an early time and succeeds as a delightful tribute to the classic whodunnit genre.JIM'S REVIEW: Knives Out is a nifty little murder mystery that pays homage to the once popular whodunnit genre. Rian Johnson assembles a fine cast of actors and writes his carefully plotted screenplay to masterful effect. Any armchair detective or moviegoer should enjoy this intriguing diversion.Mr. Johnson sets up his mystery in an elegant old mansion, the home of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a successful mystery writer who sets the plot in motion on his 85th birthday celebration by agitating family members with secrets and scandals afoot. His demise seems like a foregone conclusion with many of his children and their offsprings all having enough anger and motives to do the old fellow in.The main suspects and possible heirs to the family fortune include: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), Harlan's eldest daughter, and her husband, Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's youngest son, Walt (Michael Shannon), who is in charge of his father's publishing house, and Joni (Toni Collette), Harlan's free-spirited daughter-in-law. Also brought into the fray are Harlan's spoiled grandson with the unfortunate nickname, Ransom (Chris Evans), Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell), two more of Harlan's grandchildren, and Marta (Ana de Armas), his loyal and loving nurse who cannot tell a lie. Along with the local police team investigating the case, Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (Noah Segan), is super sleuth and private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). The cast is uniformly strong, and watching them inhabit their roles is a particular pleasure, with Mr.Plummer, Ms. de Armas, and a wonderful Mr. Craig as stand-outs.Knives Out keeps one guessing as all good mystery should do and while it stays within the Thrombey home, the story remains true to its roots. But, in the third act, the film unwisely opens up its atmospheric setting and loses some of its cherished momentum with an unexciting car chase sequence, some unnecessary plot twists, and a slightly disappointing ending.Still, Mr. Johnson's solidly uses style and ingenuity in his overall construction of his whodunnit and directs with flair. This is especially true when he incorporates his visual images to reveal the true goings-on of the events in question which directly contradicts the suspect's alibis. The audience seems to get the upper hand before the team of detectives start their deductions, making the story more complex and entertaining.Knives Out is a clever nostalgic send-up of the old murder mystery whodunnit done well. This Clue-like stage has been set for an old-fashioned murder and the mystery formula remains intact. Yes, this modern update is a welcome reimagining of the classic whodunnit and has enough charm and intelligence that would make Dame Agatha proud. Sleuth on!",Knives Out

116,rgkarim,Enjoying The Sharp Humor To This Mystery,9,27 November 2019,"Mystery movies can certainly be fun, but the refined art of mapping out a crime can be a challenge in this world with ever shrinking attention spans. However, there are still writers and directors out there ready to give it a try in hopes of bringing thought out plots back into the popular trend. Tonight's review holds such a promise and even more so it holds another redeeming trial for a director whose involvement in Star Wars was not the best received. With lots of advertising, I'm sure you have seen the trailers so let's get going as I review:LIKES:Acting
The Cinematography
The Plot Is A Good Mystery
Better Twists Than Anticipated
Involvement With Most Of The Cast
The ComedyDISLIKES:
Some rather worthless characters
The Run Time
The Pace
Perhaps A Little More MurderThe VERDICT:With an assembled cast such as this, you can best bet the acting will be at least moderate, and for me it was a fantastic display of work. All parties assembled really play the dysfunctional role well, portraying the motive filled shouts and complaints to an art that did not annoy or go overboard. Too many names to place I'll say that Craig was entertaining in his role of Colonel Saunders (a running joke) meeting James Bond as the detective, primarily in his interactions with Marta. Ana de Armas was the star for me not only because of her character, but more so in the way she played the levels of emotion perfectly and interacted with the squad the most to balance this art. Past the acting, the movie really picks up in terms of the visual presentation, feeling much like a detective movie from the 50s-80s, but modernizing it to the present day. It should captivate many mystery lovers, but more so generic fans who can point out a lot of devices and nods to famous detective sagas. However, the movie's main selling point is the presentation of the story that let's face it has been told time and time again in a Hallmark like fashion. Johnson, for me, accomplished the role of bringing out a good mystery, not only in the classic hunt for clues and mapping out suspects, but adding some nice twists to the mix. If you are paying attention to time and some info, you'll start getting an idea, but this film's twists (no matter how convoluted) do manage to spruce up the dusty manor of detective works. An even better angle for me, is the character utilization, while not perfect, every character has a purpose in some form or angle, with few sitting off to the sides as just mere bodies to fill a convenient hole or bridge. If not for the sake of the plot, then the character was used for comedy and that may be my favorite part of this movie. Knives Out manages to be very humorous in the regards of the comedy aspect, with well written dialogue, delivery of those lines, and timing wrapping up nicely to leave many laughing during my showing. That I feel will be a pull for many audience members, though don't expect usual slapstick, banter, and ridiculous, logic defying stunts to be pulled here, or you'll be disappointed.For such an artistic film though, there are still a few things I would have liked tightened up. Though all characters were utilized in some form, I can't lie at least three could have had more involvement than what they did. Hinting at being a part of the plot, these characters were left to the passing comments or joke props until that one moment a clue contributed. That family engagement they sold in the trailers, needed some more development for me to keep everyone entangled in the mess as opposed to on the side. In addition, the plot could have used a little more murder and threats to help spice up the drama/mystery, as I am partial to the deadly games of hunting in my movies, than anything else. For a movie selling that murder, I had kind of expected something else, but it's a mere trinket. I can say the thing I had the hardest time with was the run time and the pace. Knowing it's a Johnson movie, I expect it to be long, and for the most part the movie ran at a good enough pace that it did not feel super long, but other times did show the dragging I dreaded. I can say that there were parts that could have been cut out to shorten the length, or at least rewritten to include the character interaction I mentioned above.So in conclusion, what are the thoughts on this controversial movie/tale. To be honest, I do think it is a reimagining of Clue, and took a step into the modern world to help reach out to the new audiences. It's got the presentation of a mystery, with twists to help bring our well-acted characters together and entertain us with their drama. Comedy is also pulled out of the sheath and I think these two elements are the biggest selling factors to brave the nearly 2.5 hour run time Johnson has put forth. As such, I feel this movie is worth a shot at hitting the theaters for those looking for a drama/mystery/comedy, while others will most likely enjoy from the comfort of their homes.My scores for Knives Out are:Comedy/Crime/Drama: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0",Knives Out
117,Kamurai25,Best mystery I've seen since Clue,8,13 June 2020,"Great watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend.Finally! A mystery movie that I can even compare to Clue (go watch that too). This reminds me a lot of what the detective from ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is supposed to be.One of the things that really makes this stand out as a ""dinner theater"" piece, is that almost everyone is unredeemable. Instead of everyone is innocent until proven guilty, everyone is presented as a guilty (as a suspect, at least from an audience stand point), and we have to piece together the clues as we're drip-feed information.And as the movie continues, it reminds you where you might not have been paying attention, rehashes events in the logical manner that is required, in case you hadn't followed, to prove the case (again, baring semblance to ""Clue""), and every detail and every minute of the movie is intriguing.I'm looking forward to the 2nd watch to see if the re-watchability holds up.",Knives Out
118,Kingslaay,Great and Entertaining,8,26 November 2019,Knives Out is entertaining and quite a win. It has a stellar cast and uses them well. The story and mystery has echoes of Agatha Christie in this decent whodunit. What you think is straightforward has a few interesting twists. It also doesn't take itself too seriously and has the odd dose of humour. It was also easy to understand and follow the series of events. Not unnecessarily complicated.

Starring Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Noah Segan, Edi Patterson, Riki Lindhome, K Callan, Frank Oz. (PG-13)When the rich patriarch (Plummer) of a family of avaricious eccentrics dies (by suicide, it appears), private detective Craig--replete with a thick Southern drawl (""CSI: KFC,"" per Evans)--is on the case, trying to figure out what really happened and why. Entertaining mystery with a heavy dose of humor and social commentary keeps the twists coming at a fairly consistent clip throughout, modernizing the classic Agatha Christie-style potboiler without sacrificing the elegance and idiosyncrasies (wealth aside, this is not a family one would like to be a part of). Some of the surprises can be guessed pretty easily, others may prove challenging, but it's great fun no matter how good a sleuth the viewer is. Well-cast, with Craig, Collette, Curtis and de Armas being the standouts; because of the size of the ensemble, it's not always easy to keep everyone sorted out in relation to where they all fit on the family tree and beyond, but like solving a mystery, it all becomes clear by the end. Despite saying only a handful of words throughout the entire movie, Callan steals most of her scenes by virtue of vacant gaze alone.83/100",Knives Out

125,arungeorge13,Tailor-made for the lovers of whodunnit mysteries! [+77%],8,1 March 2020,"Well, well, well... we have an engaging murder mystery movie featuring a spectacular ensemble (led by Daniel Craig & Christopher Plummer) in our hands. The character played by Ana de Armas (who I remember from Knock! Knock!, War Dogs & BR 2049) is what drives the film forward to captivating twists and turns. A movie like Knives Out is best savoured by not having read the one-line-plot or seen the trailer.The first act, in my opinion, is what particularly stands out. Private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is investigating the supposed murder of wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey. Writer-director Rian Johnson carefully toys around the audience with a few leads, a few red herrings, and even a few shots that reveal more than what they're supposed to (a second watch will prove this right). Yet, it's Rian's eye for detailing that mostly works in the case of Knives Out. Craig is fantastic (as always) and his appearances out of the blue in certain scenes were a treat to watch.While Knives Out is a modern whodunnit, it really evokes the feels of reading an Agatha Christie mystery novel. As each page turns, you know you're one step closer to finding out who was behind the ghastly crime (or you don't, until the very last page). The mansion and its surroundings provided the right amount of intrigue for a storyline such as this. The score by Nathan Johnson also added an extra layer of obscurity to the proceedings. Steve Yedlin, a frequent Rian Johnson collaborator, captures the wintry vibes of Massachusetts perfectly.Knives Out is probably one of my favorite films of 2019 owing to two reasons: a) I totally dig murder mysteries b) Knives Out is astonishingly well-written and made. You may not be completely blown away by the climax twist, but the way the film builds up to it is impressive. Ana de Armas is going to have a lot of good-to-great directors approaching her shortly.",Knives Out

127,martimusross,Agatha Christie Old Style Who-Done-It,7,25 November 2019,"Knives OutI really enjoyed this movie.This was a very old style who-done-it in very much the style of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, we had a many stranded labyrinthine plot unravelled slowly by our hero detective followed by a denouement.This was very much a talking movie with little action of any kind so if you are looking for a car chase resolution this is not the movie for you.Daniel Craig did a fine job as Benoit Blanc, the drawling accent did not slip once and he dominated every scene, the whole cast did a good job occupying their respective stereotypes.It must have been good as try as I might I couldn't predict the ending.",Knives Out
128,MR_Heraclius,Knives out,9,8 February 2020,"Knives Out is really a classic story of it's kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character. There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries. And there are some good twists. In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking ""damn, are we near the end already?"" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone. In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others. It's just a classic fun film of its type.",Knives Out

130,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"I didn't know what to expect, and I came out thoroughly happy and amused.",10,12 December 2019,"Knives Out is Rian Johnson's latest feature-film and this film shows that the guy has a real knack for twisty storytelling and that he's a multi-genre man of his trade. Yes the guy directed The Last Jedi, which has adversely affected some people's perceptions of this movie, but this film is a totally different beast of an experience. And I'd say this film's easily better than The Last Jedi.Knives Out follows the story of mystery-author Harlan Thrombey's death and how The Thrombey Family deals with the fallout of the chaos: and through this set-up we get the best Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot-inspired character in a long while: Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig. The film's something of a miracle: it's a whodunit story with an all-star ensemble of Hollywood actors and it's NOT a sequel or adaptation of a pre-existing work from Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle, though you can definitely feel their influence in the highly complex and intellectual nature of their stories in Knives Out.This film's got super-sleuth galore in its cast of characters and writing, and it's got some truly fantastic cinematography to go with it. It's so well directed, thought-out and realized that it's easily one of 2019's most daring cinematic outings; it shows that the British aren't alone in doing great whodunits, and there's plenty of variety to work with in crime fiction in today's world.Knives Out is pretty damn solid cinema and an achievement for Rian Johnson.

132,Jeremy_Urquhart,"A masterful balance of humour, intrigue, and suspense that's easy to like and recommend",8,1 December 2019,"Rian Johnson's always been a strangely divisive filmmaker, and for the life of me I can't understand why. Not just The Last Jedi either (though that's the most obvious signifier of this), but I remember Looper getting pretty heavily criticised by IMDB users back in 2012 (check the top rated reviews- a lot of the highest ranked ones are still incredibly negative).Knives Out, however, is much more likely to be a crowdpleaser. It's incredibly entertaining and very breezy and accessible, and I don't say that as a negative. Not every film has to challenge or provoke or depress its audience to be considered great... though that being said, I can't help but feel like there's something missing here that stops it from being a GREAT movie. It's frustrating because I can't put my finger on why, but then at a point I remember all the things this movie does have going for it, and it ultimately doesn't matter that my gut's telling me it's an 8/10 rather than a 9 or a 10.Right off the bat, well, right from the poster, it's pretty clear to see how fantastic this cast is, and I'm happy to say everyone gives a good performance here. It's hard to pick a standout, besides perhaps picking the characters who end up having more screen-time than others (and honestly, in a way that'd almost be a spoiler for a movie like this).I was similarly impressed by how this movie managed to be very funny without feeling silly or like an outright spoof of mystery/whodunnit movies. It presents a multi-layered mystery that's easy to take seriously, yet never really gets too bogged down or overly gloomy. The humour's there and it almost always lands, but for me never really distracted or seemed out of place, and I think it's the sign of a truly great screenplay if it's able to balance varied emotions and provoke different responses from its audience. It's going to get compared a lot to Clue (1985) and maybe also Murder By Death (1976), though I'd say Knives Out is better than those on account of being just as funny without being farcical to the point of not being able to be taken seriously.Honestly, ignore my fairly petty suggestion that this movie's missing something, because to be frank I'm trying to do the same. Sit back, let the movie do its thing, and enjoy yourself. Coming up to awards season, with lots of serious movies vying for the attention of critics and awards-givers, sometimes a movie like Knives Out is exactly what audiences may find themselves needing.",Knives Out

It is intriguing and dramatic and quirky and humorous in all the right places.Like the classic whodunit films the pace is kept purposely slow - although it has been kicked into second gear to make things a little fresher.It is clever, but not so clever that you can't have fun working things out - and the story actually works.Direction, acting, production and camera work is great.

142,educallejero,Excellent writing still wasted tons of potential,5,19 December 2019,"The movie starts really high. The presentation of characters is superb. Entertaining (and needed) exposition mixed with funny dialogue and great performances, ultra natural. But after 15 great minutes, the real protagonist Marta (Ana de Armas) takes center stage. The movie promised by the trailer (""Clue"" but in a movie, and funnier), just wasn't anymore. She was the victim's nurse. The victim was the patriarch of a family, owner of millions and murdered the night of his 85 birthday. The supporting character is detective Blanc (Daniel Craig), motivated by a curious anonymous contract to investigate the crime.From there, the focus is on Marta and her connection with the family and the crime, and the detective trying to unveil the truth, leaving the rest of the cast in the periphery. The film's pace suffers. Even with great writing, the story just gets more conventional. Chris Evan's character, Ramson, gets a bigger part after an hour, but by that time, the movie just had lost the intensity. It ends up being dense. A mix of repetitive ""investigation scenes"", good jokes, bad jokes, little twists and bigger twists, and it turns awkward.With a lack of emotional weight and skin deep social commentary, the solved mystery doesn't satisfy.The idealization of the minorities (in this case, Latin-American), creating a character almost impossibly virtuous without any defect, felt clearly condescending.",Knives Out

Whatever you think is going to happen here, doesn't. That's fascinating. Rian Johnson is a really talented guy. I feared that this film was going to suffer cliches and lulls throughout, but not for a second was I not invested. I loved the convoluted nature of the mystery. The cast themselves help bring it all together. The standout is Daniel Craig in the most gloriously fun role he's ever delivered. It's hammy, it's over-the-top, but that's the point. He plays an old-school southern detective with an unorthodox knack for cracking completely absurd murder mysteries. He puts Sherlock Holmes to shame. The rest of the cast fires on all cylinders. This is the rare instance of an ensemble cast in which everyone compliments each other beautifully. I believe we'd go from a really good film to a great one with a trim of unnecessary dialogue. A few key pages of this scrip hint at a larger political message that doesn't materialize into anything meaningful, nor was it necessary. Some characters are seen, but seldom used, like Lakeith Stanfield as the lieutenant detective. But overall, this movie is nothing but fun.",Knives Out
145,rockman182,Knives Out (2019),8,6 December 2019,"A lot of people had issues with Star Wars: The Last Jedi but I absolutely loved it. Then again, I've rated Rian Johnson since he came onto the scene with Brick and later followed up with a smart science fiction thriller in Looper. Knives Out by trailer didn't look lik anything amazing although a ""whodunnit?"" is always fun. Reviews seemed very positive and it is all warranted. This one comes with a unique way of solving the crime and its humor and ensemble cast make for an entertaining watch.
The film is about the death of a very wealthy novelist. Initially, his death is deemed to be a suicide but a renown detective with a bizarre southern accent named Benoit Blanc is suspicious and thinks that the man was murdered by his family. His family members appear to be hiding more than they seem and clues come one by one. However, its not a simple case of murder and the circumstances leading to the death are very unique and no as forward as it seems. Interestingly enough, Ana de Armas takes a huge role here as a lead character.
I think the film should be commended for its storytelling. Its not like other films where you have to wait till the end to make your decision on who the culprit was. In a way the film is more transparent than that but also still very elusive. The hallmark of a good film is how its just engaging throughout through a sharply written script that thrives on its humor and call backs to films of the past in the same genre. I loved seeing de Armas in a lead role. Wanted to see a lot more of her ever since Knock Knock. Daniel Craig also turns in a memorable performance.
This is definitely worth a watch also for its truly great ensemble cast. None of the family are particularly likeable and its supposed to be that way. Whatever grudges you may have had against Johnson for The Last Jedi should be freshly bowled over because Knives Out is a smartly entertaining film that is capping of a rather great year in film. Impressive stuff.

147,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A refreshing take on the mystery genre.,8,11 January 2020,"One of the most under-utilized genres to date, a good mystery movie is hard to find these days. This is partly why Knives Out (2019) is such a joy to watch. With plenty of twists and turns-and a murderer that subverts all the numerous tropes of the genre-this film is almost on the edge of self-aware satire of mysteries on the whole. This is partly why I found Knives Out to be delightfully amusing: the absurd nature of some of the genre's most tightly-held motifs were playfully subverted for a couple of genuine laughs.Of course, part of the problem of Knives Out being so self-aware is that it is inevitably predictable at several key moments. Depending on how far ahead a viewer can deduce the solution to a critical piece of evidence might determine how predictable it is for them. I did appreciate that there was always one piece of the puzzle that remained unsolved to keep the plot moving along, but there were also enough clues that helped make some of the twists a bit more evident than they probably should have been.In terms of the cast, Knives Out sports a veritable ""who's who"" that will make the ""6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game much easier in the future. Some individuals, like Jamie Lee Curtis, were woefully underused, but Michael Shannon and Chris Evans stand out as exemplary roles in this film. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Daniel Craig, who seems to be having fun distancing himself from his iconic James Bond role. While his performance is undoubtedly one of the reasons you should watch this film, I was slightly distracted by his choice of accent, which just sounded odd at times.A refreshing take on the mystery genre, I give Knives Out 4.0 stars out of 5.",Knives Out

This one has more than enough clues that if you're paying attention, you'll probably figure it out too if you grew up reading Agatha Christie. The only thing is that I think there's one last bit that isn't spelled out at the very end, but I don't want to spoil this enjoyable film. I'll let you decide for yourself if the mystery is ""fully solved"" at the very end. I don't have anything really negative to say about this film, other than that Craig seems so desperate from getting away from playing James Bond, that he went a bit too far in a campy, hammy direction that annoyed me a small amount (not anywhere near enough to wreck the film for me though). I'd encourage pretty much anyone to give this film a go, and considering the world we we're living in, I'd have to say it's pretty family-friendly on top of everything else too.",Knives Out

The cast is great and efficiently delivers the required ping-pong of quips and zingers.See also the much darker (and superior) thriller/black comedy Sleuth with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, which probably served as one of the inspirations for this, starting with the setting, the secluded mansion of an eccentric mystery writer.7/10",Knives Out

Writer-director Rian Johnson has given us a very unique whodunit movie, that has elements of comedy & drama, apart from being a suspense thriller. When you think you know what's going to happen, something absolutely different happens. It is delightfully unpredictable. The performances are the highlight of the film. Daniel Craig is spectacular as Benoit Blanc. Craig nails the southern American accent. Chris Evans is outstanding as Ransom Drysdale. It is awesome to see Evans play a character that is in stark contrast to Captain America, the role he's known for worldwide. Ana de Armas is the star of the show as Marta Cabrera. Ana de Armas portrays a variety of emotions with aplomb & has a very long & bright career ahead of her. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as Linda Drysdale. Michael Shannon is amazing as Walt Thrombey. Don Johnson is awesome as Richard Drysdale. Toni Collette is brilliant as Joni Thrombey. LaKeith Stanfield is great as Lieutenant Elliott. Christopher Plummer is superb as Harlan Thrombey.

151,bankofmarquis,Clever and Original...enough,8,3 January 2020,"KNIVES OUT was one of the films I had circled on my calendar as a ""must see"". It seemed to be a perfect antidote to the CGI-Fest films that are very prevalent in the multi-plex today. So...when life got in the way and I couldn't get to this film for about a month, I tried (and succeeded) in not getting this movie spoiled for me in my various Social Media feeds.And I'm glad I went to such lengths, for I found KNIVES OUT to be a truly original and entertaining film that kept me guessing throughout the length of the film - right up to the ""big reveal.""So...if you haven't seen this film...stop reading this now...go see it...and come back.Still here (or are you back)? Okay...let's continue...Directed by Rian Johnson (known by many as the Director of THE LAST JEDI, but I think this movie owes more of it's heritage to his breakthrough film BRICK or his Sci-Fi action flick, LOOPER), KNIVES OUT is an old-fashioned, Agatha Christie-type murder mystery complete with an oddball Detective trying to figure out ""whodunnit"" that features an All-Star cast of suspects as well as an Oscar winning murder victim.As I stated above, Johnson has traversed a murder mystery-type film before in his neo-noir homage BRICK, but in this film he really let's his wings fly as he plays, marvelously, with the drawing room murder mystery pastiche. Johnson wrote and directed this film and the twists and turns and originality of his vision is apparent on screen, playing with expectations without being too clever.He has assembled an All-Star cast of actors playing interesting characters. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Toni Colette, Don Johnson and Jacob Trombley all bring star power and charisma to their roles and each one COULD have been the murderer. As often happens in these types of films, each one gets A scene to shine, but only the one ""whodunnit"" really gets to step out.As the Law Enforcement on their trail, Lakeith Stanfield (GET OUT) and Noah Segan (LOOPER) play off each other well and they play off of Daniel Craig (James Bond, of course) very well. Craig plays Private Detective Benoit Blanc with some sort of Cajun-type accent that works more than it doesn't, I enjoyed his performance enough to find it charming and not annoying.Special notice needs to be made of the performances of Christopher Plummer - as the murder victim (I'm not spoiling anything here, it's in the trailer) and Frank Oz (the famous Muppeteer and Director). Both are ""old pros"" who bring a grounding to the proceedings. Their performances are almost down to earth commentaries on the other characters/performances and they both helped out this film tremendously.Finally, the film revolves around the journey that Ana de Armas' character, Maria Cabrera, is on in this film. She is the audience's eyes and ears into this story, having clues and plot points revealed to her as we, the audience, have them revealed to us. I fell in love with de Armas when she played Joi in BLADE RUNNER: 2049 and she is pleasant enough company here to search out this mystery with.With all these pieces - and characters - to put together and move around, I did find that this film suffered a bit by ""too much"" and ""too fast"" at times that caused me not to care about certain people and circumstances (especially at the beginning), but that was quickly forgotten/forgiven as the film progressed and I was engrossed in the mystery - a mystery that I did not know how it was going to end.And that, is unique and rare enough for me.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Knives Out

157,bob-the-movie-man,Rip-roaringly entertaining Whodunnit from Rian Johnson,9,4 December 2019,"If they were to give it a go, this movie should justifiably be Rian's redemption from the harshest of his previous critics. For this is a really entertaining film. I found myself smiling with glee through a sizable proportion of the running time.Multi-millionaire crime-fiction author Harlan Thrombey (the wonderful Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday with three generations of his family in his ""Cludo-like"" mansion. But all is not well with the family harmonic and the next morning Harlan is found dead in his room by his nurse Marta (Ana de Armas). Apparently, it's a suicide, but when private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) arrives on the scene he starts turning over stones ""oin seearch ov tha troooth"" (sic) and dark secrets begin to emerge.Key to success of this Agatha Christie-style movie is a dense portmanteau cast and a well-plotted script. Both are here present.In terms of the cast, this is another candidate for the SAG Ensemble Cast award. For the cast is suitably stellar with Chris ""Cap"" Evans, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson vying for the top billing with Craig and Plummer. They bounce off each other joyously, with Collette taking my prize for top acting kudos. She's just deliciously over the top as the scheming hippy chick with the rasping voice and the cutting one-liners.With a starring role is Cuban bombshell Ana de Armas, here notching down the glamour to play the plainly dressed nurse. But she has a magnetic screen presence and is perfectly cast as the girl at the heart of all the action. She has the doe-eyed innocence that Alfred Hitchcock was always looking for in his leading ladies. Interestingly, she is soon to appear with Craig again as Bond-girl Paloma in ""No Time to Die"".Elsewhere in the cast are some interesting cameos: the family's lawyer is none other than Frank ""Yoda"" Oz; and the ancient security guard is M. Emmet Walsh, who has an amazing filmography going back to the late 60's.Writer/director is clearly his 'thing'. But Rian Johnson here pulls off a neat trick with the script which is brilliantly twisty and turny and 100% entertaining. Although it's presented as cuts between the 'present time' and versions of the night in question, the whole doughnut is never entirely in view until the final reel. It's a satisfying story, and some of the dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny.A nice plot point is the inability for young Marta to tell a lie without vomiting. Wouldn't the UK General Elections be Sooooo much more colourful if that was a general trait!!I've only the one real criticism of the movie, and that's Daniel Craig's appalling Southern drawl. It's really quite distracting. Aside from some witty lines of dialogue (""What is this? CSI KFC?"") nothing would have been lost to cast him as an urbane English detective instead. They could have slipped in some Brexit jokes instead! I appreciate Craig wants to distance himself from Bond somewhat. He did the same thing as Joe Bang in ""Logan Lucky"". But - sorry - it didn't really work for me then and it doesn't work now either.In summary, this is a really fun movie that a whole family with older children (the rating is 12+) can go and enjoy together. There's limited violence; limited swearing and sexual innuendo; and no sex (save for the Hitler youth in the bathroom!). But there is a whole lot of sleuthing fun to be had. Bravo Mr Johnson, bravo!

158,mikayakatnt,Amazing!,8,13 July 2020,"I saw the trailer and I was skeptical. Yet, this film far exceeded all my expectations and then some.With special homage to Clue & Murder on the Orient Express, Knives Out is a murder-mystery. Knives Out is a whodunit that's visually appealing, fresh, and fun.Every detail leaves audiences chasing breadcrumbs and guessing who is the perpetrator throughout. While it's common to assume who's responsible, we learn that every detail given is as important as the last. Audiences' suspicions will change continually throughout the film in an organic way.Though Rian Johnson created this masterpiece, more special appreciation to the absolute A+ cast in this film. In such a star-packed film, it's surprising that chaos no one actor claimed most of the screentime. Special shout-out to Daniel Craig's (fake but hilarious) southern drawl, Chris Evans' as the prodigal son, Jamie Lee Curtis as the tough-as-nails mogul, Jaeden Martell as the young alt-right jerk, and the rising stardom of Ana de Armas & Lakeith Stanfield and many more.

160,kjproulx,A Fantastically Clever Whodunnit,9,1 December 2019,"From Looper to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Arian Johnson has been a filmmaker on the rise for the last number of years. Although many Star Wars fans seem to not like his addition to the Star Wars franchise, I loved it and I believe him to be one of the greatest directors out there today. My love for him as a filmmaker alone had me excited for his newest release in Knives Out. He took a step backward since his last outing, writing a directing a very small movie with a very large feel. This move was the best thing he could have possibly done for his career, because he has made one hell of a crowd pleaser. Knives Out is terrific and here's why it's worth your time.Following the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), his entire family is questioned about his sudden demise. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) oversees this investigation and believes there to be a lot hidden under the surface of this story. This begins the story and classic ""whodunnit"" feel. There is something that feels very tradition about this movie, with updated dialogue and very unique camerawork to make it a fantastic watch. This movie is pretty much as good as you can get with a story like this these days. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Knives Out.I can praise Rian Johnson for writing a clever screenplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is does, or I can gush about the precise cinematography that is incredibly well-done, but this film is held together by an insanely talented cast who are all having a blast. If not for this stellar cast committing to these wacky and hilarious characters, then Knives Out would have been pretty boring. This movie benefits from the comedy and I think this cast has a lot to do with that. With that said, this film isn't quite perfect.Even though nitpicking a movie like this is kind of ridiculous, due to the nature of it needing to contain twists and turns, I have to admit that the movie is slightly predictable, even though it leads you to believe it's not. Without ruining anything, it becomes fairly obvious where things will go after a certain point, so that was a detriment for me. Thankfully, the way everything is presented is very clever and definitely showcases the reveals in ways you're not expecting. Even if you figure out what happened, you won't be able to predict how it happened, and I really appreciated that aspect.In the end, Knives Out has a nice blend of suspense and comedy to keep almost audiences engaged. I found this blend to be great and would happily revisit these characters again in the future. With fantastic writing and directing by Rian Johnson and a cast that's giving their all in the funnest way possible, it's hard not to like this one. For fans of murder mysteries, comedies, or even any of these performers, I highly recommend checking out Knives Out.",Knives Out
161,AhmedSpielberg99,"""That certainly not what I was expecting.""",9,16 February 2020,"Whodunit?Rian Johnson.Why?To subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!As divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.In Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.Not only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an ""Anti-Captain America ""; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!Overall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes!

Once you think you've figured out who did this mysterious killing of an 85-year-old crime novelist, then your thoughts are discarded and you immediately think another suspect did the mortal deed.
Knives Out is a clever movie with an honest, plausible script. The actors are brilliant, and the dialogue is top-notch. But for those who get uncomfortable with an excessively talkie setting (and what who-done-it movie doesn't have a lot of dialogue), then this film may not be for you.

163,Movie-Misfit,Simply Wonderful!!,10,26 December 2019,"Bringing a Cluedo (Clue) game to the big screen and to a modern audience in 2019 may have seemed somewhat of a gamble for director Rian Johnson. With the (welcome) influx of superhero movies, big budget visual effects, snappy editing and dumbed down scripts - a film such such as Knives Out, presented in a cinematic style that reminds me of similar classics from yesteryear, just may have been too smart for a millennial audience...And whether they got it or not, the film has certainly proven to be one of this years finest and best Hollywood productions which I just loved!Honestly, I went in not expecting much - but those expectations quickly faded within the first ten minutes as I was sucked in to this hilarious murder mystery.With great performances from all involved, although Marta was my fave - as well as tons of little Easter eggs and nods to many inspirations before it, I couldn't say a bad thing about Knives Out and was so happy that my 16 year old son could experience such a great film on the big screen, so different to his usual viewings.A pleasure to watch and entertaining the whole way through, Knives Out could be in the top 3 for 2019..!",Knives Out

The story is very cleverly done and just when you think it's all over a massive twist happens (which I won't spoil of course), I did feel like some of the characters could have been developed a bit more and there was perhaps too much of an emphasise on Ana de Armas's character but these are minor critiques and too much detail may have slowed the pace down and made it less exciting.Cinematography was good and very modern but in the style of the Hollywood classics which I really enjoyed.8/10: A great family film where you have to think a bit",Knives Out
165,Carycomic,Rian Johnson proves he's far better at drawing room whodunits than science fiction.,10,6 January 2020,"I went to see this, at a second-run theater, expecting this to be the ""Dude, Where's My Car?' of murder mysteries. But, I actually found myself enjoying this! And I attribute that as much to the collective talents of the cast as the brains of the director (who, quite frankly, had a lot to make up for after SW:TLJ).First off, there were Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer. Those two, of course, contributed greatly to the box office success of the Anglo-American remake of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. So, no, it doesn't surprise me that history repeated itself with this movie.Then, there's Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson. She proves, here, that she can scream insults at (fictional) dysfunctional relatives as easily as she can scream in horrified distress at a machete-wielding impersonator of William Shatner. While he proves just as versatile at playing an unfaithful husband as he has at playing street-wise undercover cops and aging ex-hippie widowers in romantic comedies!Chris Evans, as H.R. Drysdale, is also surprisingly good at breaking away from his superheroic images as Johnny Storm and Captain America. While Frank Oz was initially unrecognizable, to me, as the Thrombey family lawyer. But, it's a credit to his non-Muppetry acting skills that he was even funnier in this role than he was as Yoda!Last but not least? Ana de Armas, as Marta, is a newcomer to me. But, she does a superb job of playing the courageous Latina nurse misguidedly carrying out the last request of a recently deceased patient. And, if I were as kind-hearted as Marta, I'd restrict my unselfishness to the only two Thrombeys who truly deserve it: Meg and Nana! The latter, as Harlan's mom, is a hundred years-old if she's a day. And, thus, she has very few alternatives left as to how she spends the rest of her life. While the former (though a little naive when it comes to life outside her ""green-collar"" family) is genuinely sincere in her egalitarian beliefs.In short, I was delightfully kept guessing from beginning to end. And I'm dead certain most everyone else who goes to see this will feel the same way.",Knives Out

167,JohnRayPeterson,Oh the joy of a good whodunit!,9,11 January 2020,"Murder mystery novels are still a thing, thankfully, but whodunit movies are not as common and when one has a cast such as 'Knives Out', what a joy it is for movie enthusiasts. The iconic Agatha Christie would have smiled in approval, I think, at this work from Rian Johnson. Johnson is not a newbie at this and it took 'Knives Out' for me to notice. He wrote three episodes of the award winning series 'Breaking Bad', in case you didn't know, and his directorial work here was on the mark.The victim Harlan Thrombey, played by the master actor Christopher Plummer, pops up all through the movie as we observe the customary flashbacks of the clues we are teased with. As with all 'whodunit' works, there are many characters for you to speculate did the deed of killing Harlan. Wait, was Harlan even murdered? Ah! Yes, this whodunit, as many murder mysteries tend to incorporate, has the added mystery factor 'Is it or is it not a murder'? I won't say more in case you haven't seen the movie.There is a full cast of characters, played by many actors we are most familiar with, an added positive for me, and these characters all seem to have possible motive for causing Harlan's demise. The movie walks you through the Thrombey family intricate relationships and the family business of course. It is a web artfully woven to keep you captivated from beginning to the end. The writer director clearly demonstrates his knowledge of movie making in the way he introduces Benoit Blanc to the viewing audience; Blanc, played by Daniel Craig was a pleasure to watch. His character's introduction was nothing short of brilliant and early into the movie the mood is set for you to start placing your bets on who done it!But you will lose your bet for sure, no matter what; it's a bet you won't mind losing. Any good mystery movie should not make it easy for the viewer to figure out the movie's climax. So, you won't, and that's why this is such a fun movie.",Knives Out

169,DarthVoorhees,Masterfully written and constructed but Johnson's show of hands hides a pretty predictable conclusion,7,30 January 2020,"'Knives Out' is one of those frustrating films where almost everything works until it comes time to explain it's secrets. 'Knives Out' revels in creating a whodunnit that pays tribute to the iconography of the best films that have followed this formula in the past. Rian Johnson is a director that loves movies and that love is infectious. His cast is expertly constructed and completely buy into Johnson's uniquely quirky world.The star of the film is Johnson's screenplay that knows the formula of an Agatha Christie-esque thriller and plays against the conventions while still embracing the audience's love for them. 'Knives Out' has the expected gimmicky and colorful suspects who play off a very real grounded performance from Ana de Armas. The juxtaposition between the rich self centered Thrombey family and the working class Marta works as a commentary and yet Johnson is able to still have that levity while tackling pretty poignant themes and commentary. This isn't an easy thing for a screenwriter to do.The major problem I have with the movie is it's ending and who ends up being the ""killer"" who sets the story in motion. I just feel that despite all of Johnson's clever storytelling tricks that he chose the most predictable way to wrap up this story. The character is in my opinion is hinted too much at. I felt like he was clearly a red herring and yet no, Johnson just gives in. I won't spoil it because the fun of this movie is not knowing but it is a pretty big actor who is less than subtle here. It's a mix of pretty uninspired writing in an otherwise fantastic script and a big actor who just cant quite find how close to over the top he wants to be",Knives Out

173,anselmdaniel,An excellent written mystery,8,2 May 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Knives Out is a mystery movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed, written, and produced by Rian Johnson. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. A wealthy crime novelist is found dead and the leading cause is suicide. A famous private detective by the name of Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, is invited to investigate the death.Knives Out is a great mystery that has many positive attributes. Knives Out's primary attribute is its snazzy writing. The writing is incredibly energetic and done well by Rian Johnson. The writing is the main draw to this story as the audience tries to piece together the mystery. Harlan Thrombey died after a family reunion which did not go perfectly. The story gradually uncovers facts such as the nurse Marta having accidentally killed Harlan. The movie unfolds these mysteries incredibly well and uses aspects such as Marta's inability to lie to great effect.
Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera is an excellent actress in the role. She portrays the nurse that needs to stay one step ahead of the investigation incredibly. I found that all the scenes with her portrayed the desperation, humor, and deviousness in a way that was refreshing to see. Marta Cabrera had a funny innocence to the character as the mystery unfolded and she discovered she was being used.The main highlight in the movie is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. The private detective has a southern drawl that is played to great effect by Daniel Craig. The movie uses this character effectively as Marta frequently tries to get ahead of the private investigator. I enjoyed all the scenes with Benoit Blanc and it is easy to get lost in the character's charm. Even when the character is acting lazily this is entertaining to watch.I would recommend 'Knives Out'.Grade: B",Knives Out

175,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,2 December 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Knives Out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can't deny that I was indeed affected by the whole ""a whodunnit like you haven't seen in years."" I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It's uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a ""bad"" movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn't, he did other stuff, you know?). It's one of those films everyone knows it's going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.Even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole ""best X of the decade,"" I'm going one step beyond). This is a film I know I'm going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who ""did it,"" the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn't need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.This screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell's). It's been half-a-day since I've seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there's an answer lying on someone's words or actions. It's such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it's impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.I genuinely love the first act, even if it's the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn't waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It's through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn't, then it does again...That's one of the reasons I couldn't figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel ""intellectually superior"" just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time's up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, ""I guessed it,"" there's a 99% chance that they're either lying or not answering correctly to the question ""who killed Harlan?"" If you've seen the movie, you'll understand what I'm trying to express.(I don't want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I'm not trying to say, ""I couldn't figure it out, so no one can."" Please, if you haven't seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)Throughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera's (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.However, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I've been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I'm ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he's been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it's sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.My only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It's like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell's Jacob and Katherine Langford's Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act's interrogatories. It's great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.In the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I've ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he's a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess ""who did it"" beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It's an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don't miss it!",Knives Out

Rian Johnson as the director did a phenomenal job of making sure that every piece falls into its desired place. A well constructed writing, with some clever bits and pieces given here and there in order to tease the viewer; it certainly showcases its true merit in that regard. It makes us guess the actual culprit several times, it makes us confuse more with every new incident. Even though the revelation at the end wasn't totally surprising but the sheer amount of excellence in the build up alone could provide the much needed satisfaction. And I must point out the cumulative blend of Comedy and Suspense here; as the balance has been done tremendously well. They never crosses each others path and stays in their own territories. I liked that. Cinematography, Sound Design both pay homage to Vintage movies. The nostalgic locations somehow finds its similarities with classic cinemas that belonged from the same genre. Performances are outright brilliant. Each one of the characters have done justice to their respective roles. Special Mention must go to Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans as they were truly the driving force behind.
Some political ideologies have also been talked about although they didn't portray much importance in here in terms of the storyline but surely showcased Different viewpoints in an interesting presentation nonetheless.

If this had been cut to half an hour it would still have been too long.However, I should first reveal who it is that Daniel Craig is attempting to do an impression of.
It's Spencer Tracy as Henry Drummond (interpreting southern 1920's lawyer Clarence Darrow) in Inherit The Wind (1960). And actually, Craig's impression of Spencer Tracy's impression of a southern 1920's courtroom lawyer is vaguely accurate for an Englishman - it's just that it simply does not work in a mock country house mystery trying to do Poirot in the 20teens, pretending to be Hitchcock.

The film, perhaps like many family gatherings, does feel a bit crowded. By the way, LaKeith Stanfield fans this is NOT the film you are dying to see.Anyways, like most mysteries, it gets reverse-engineered with lego-like precision on shots and plot.

185,MrDHWong,One of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time,9,28 November 2019,"Knives Out is a whodunit mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom). Starring Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ana de Armas, it is one of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time.One day after celebrating his 85th birthday with his dysfunctional family at his large mansion, renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study room. The police are soon called to the scene to investigate the causes of Harlan's death and to determine if foul play was a factor in all of this. Joining them is the famous private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who has his own unconventional methods of figuring out the situation, much to the chagrin of the other Thrombey family members.With its slick production values and witty dialogue, Knives Out injects so much quirky energy into what is widely considered to be an archaic genre and successfully modernises it as a result. Writer/Director Rian Johnson, who clearly has an affinity for this type of movie, takes a great amount of influence from the work of Agatha Christie, with the singular setting and oddball characters rounding off what would normally considered a surface level murder mystery. In addition to this, Johnson detracts from the usual European vibe of the genre to give the film a considerably more American feel, reminding his audience that the genre is universal and not necessarily restricted to a particular continent or culture.There is so much beautiful visual flair in this film. Each scene felt articulately laid out with such clever use of colour and symmetry. One part of the film's set involves an expensive looking seat with a plethora of knives surrounding it in a circular pattern, which can catch the viewer off guard during some important scenes. This again feels like a callback to the whodunits of decades ago, which implemented the surroundings into the story, making the audience question whether or not certain things played a role in the murder itself.Every character was used brilliantly throughout the story, with each one serving a purpose no matter how minor it seemed. All of the family members have a reason to be involved in Harlan's death and deducing who has the strongest involvement kept the film moving along at a brisk pace. However, to single out too many characters would give away the ending so I will only single out one: Daniel Craig. Craig is clearly having a wonderful time playing Benoit Blanc, who can only be described as a southern US Hercule Poirot. At first, Blanc seems like a total goofball with a funny accent but the further the story advanced, the more it felt like he was a figure the audience could trust at solving this mystery.In conclusion, while whodunits may seem dead to some, thanks to the efforts of Rian Johnson, there is proof that there is still so much enjoyment to be had. Even veteran viewers of the genre may be surprised at some of the twists the film throws at them. I urge modern audiences to give it a chance, whether you care for these types of films at all.

The plot is simple, but it is interesting to follow, the cast also did not disappoint. I can 't say this is the best scenario of 2019, but the plot can surprise.

187,Alexander_Blanchett,Predictable but nicely old fashioned,8,29 December 2019,"I love good and twisted Who's done its and that is why I looked especially forward to this one, knowing what a great cast and creative mind like Rian Johnson is behind it.
The result is an entertaining, well acted and directed yet often a bit predictable mystery comedy/thriller. What I hoped more for it, was a more out-of-your-mind twist than the one that was actually coming In the end. Still, it was fun and thats its main purpose.
Daniel Craig made a good detective and added a lot of fun attributes to his character. The true revelation of the film was Ana Da Armas who has been under the radar quite a few years yet but finally gets her big break with a truly scene-stealing performance, especially next to acting heavy weights like Michael Shannon or Christopher Plummer who both did very well, too. Chris Evans was also really outstanding and nicely playing with his image which worked perfectly and hopefully opens up for more dynamic or twisted roles in the future. Jamie Lee Cutis and Toni Collette had some fun moments and you could see that both truly loved playing their roles. Don Johnson and especially Jaeden Martell were the weakest spots of the bunch. The score was nice, and the look in general great. It worked like a traditional film of its kind and played along with all the conventional elements without trying to re-invent them which I liked and was most afraid about.
Like I said, the only thing that I could have hoped for was a less predictable final twist and conclusion. Other than than that undoubtedly a fun movie.",Knives Out

Well, the wife and I fell asleep during the first 20-mins, so big ding for early pacing. The next night I insisted we finish it because ""all star cast..."" and it turned out well. It was a decent enough whodunnit with a few twists/misdirections. The final scene could've been better architected, so we weren't really satisfied with its denouement.",Knives Out
189,cardsrock,"A fun, modernized whodunnit",9,5 December 2019,"Rian Johnson has crafted an enjoyable new spin on the murder mystery genre. With a stacked cast led by Daniel Craig and Chris Evans having loads of fun in their roles, Knives Out is very much set in today's world and updated accordingly. I liked that the story was a complex web, but not one impossible to follow if you pay attention to the various little clues throughout the movie. Even if you can guess what will happen, there are still some extra twists that can throw you for a loop. This film is terrifically entertaining and will leave you in awe of its pay off.",Knives Out
190,CANpatbuck3664,A Fun Old-School Mystery With Enough Twists to Keep You Guessing,8,29 November 2019,"If you saw the marketing material for Knives Out, it pitches you on a classic whodunit. All of the characters have something to hide, things are often not as they appear and there's going to be a big twist at the end. Some of these elements are in Knives Out but this is a rare case in that it looks like a whodunit, sounds like a whodunit but is actually something else. They don't go the expected route and they reveal the nature of the crime much earlier than you would expect them to. It was a nice choice to subvert expectations, I was a little disappointed but they brought me around on it by the end. So adjust your line of thinking going into Knives Out, you might think you have it figured out but trust me when I say ""THE GAME'S AFOOT.""We also get a classic setup for the characters motivations, it was a nice blend of what you expect and something new. A fortune is at stake, everyone has something to gain from Harlan's death and when the shoe drops, no one is completely forthcoming. There's some depth given to all the players, I was surprised that Michael Shannon or Toni Collette weren't given more to go off of but we learn enough about them to understand why everyone is a suspect. I did get a little annoyed with how everyone was constantly lying or snickering when Blanc looked away, it shifted my thinking into suspecting many parties being involved when the reality was much more simple. There are so many red herrings that it was tiresome to keep up but I do think the ending delivered the desired payoff.The cast of this movie doesn't compare to the Avengers or you're average Marvel team up but you're going to recognize most of this cast and they've all given memorable performances in other films. I'd classify Daniel Craig as the lead and he's pitch perfect as Blanc. He gets the opportunity to be a little more laid back and comedic compared to James Bond and between this and Logan Lucky, he's got the range to pull this off. I really enjoyed the energy he brought to his character and I tip my hat to him for stretching a little in Knives Out. Ana de Armas gets the next most screen time and I thought she was good as well. She's dressed down and the role is much less glamorous than something like Blade Runner 2049 and she appropriately adapts. She's decent at being mousy and reserved and she added a lot to this movie. Chris Evans is in the cast, he's more sarcastic than when he's playing Cap but this was a nice return to a more Johnny Storm or Jensen character. But he also has to get serious and if you haven't seen his more dramatic work, he's more than capable of that and he delivers. Christopher Plummer was in the movie more than I thought he would be, he's a theatrical treasure, of course he was great. The rest of the supporting cast gets less to work with than you would think, they all get their moments but they're collectively good as opposed to 1 or 2 standout performances (all of them were good at giving the shifty-eye and twirling their respective moustaches).The best setting for a murder mystery is always a big mansion on a dark and stormy night. Knives Out has that classic kind of flavour, it isn't afraid to steer into tropes while avoiding others. I really liked the setting, it was fun and there's a lot of atmosphere despite the movie only featuring a few locations. The house becomes another character on the screen and this can be important in helping bring you into this world. The movie is shot well on top of this, the costuming and the set dressing is what you would picture in a game of Clue (it was referenced in the movie), it was only missing a ball and a character in a tuxedo. It's edited and scored to grow the tension and even though I would describe it as more workmanlike than fantastic, there were few missteps or problems which is a credit to the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by Knives Out. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical response, I was happy to catch this when it was on streaming services. A friend of mine was eager to see it though and I'm glad he convinced me to go. I'm glad Rian Johnson got the opportunity to bounce back (I don't want to comment on the Last Jedi, my review is on the site and the screaming of opposing opinions on both sides about The Last Jedi robbed me of my enjoyment of Star Wars, thanks a lot for that everyone). I like a good murder mystery but I have a hard time reading the genre due the trope heavy kind of writing it requires. This carries over into movies but I have to admit when they're done right, they can be breathtaking (Gone Girl, A Simple Favour are both excellent movies that have come out recently). If I were looking for a comparison, it shares a lot in common with Murder on the Orient Express (the 2017 Kenneth Branagh directed movie) and I would pick Knives Out as the better effort. The cast looks like their having a blast, the characters are diverse and mysterious, the story is engaging and features enough curve balls to keep the reveal a mystery and the setting is a fun old school throwback that I enjoyed as well. Knives Out is a fun couple of hours at the theatre, its not a towering achievement in cinema or a masterpiece of screenwriting but its a well thrown change-up leading into the December ""award"" season. I'd rate Knives Out between a 8-9/10 but I'm going to round down until I see it a 2nd time, I don't know if it will hold up as well to repeat viewings. If you're interested, I'd recommend checking it out in theatres",Knives Out

All I know is Rian Johnson just proved it is still possible to write and direct a great genre film that is self aware but still takes its story and its characters seriously (and even manages to make some points without trying too hard). The cast is great. The homages to classic murder mysteries are fantastic. The humor is both hilarious and subtle. The twists are just right. I hope EVERYONE goes to see it because EVERYONE can enjoy it. Here's hoping more filmmakers (and studios) are willing to tell these kinds of stories.

196,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,13 February 2020,"The stage curtains open ...In the age of NCIS, Law & Order, CSI, and True Detective, we are treated to this fun and engaging throwback to the classic ""Whodunit"" with the film, ""Knives Out"". I have to admit, I had my share of trepidation going into this one. Because, lately, whenever we are given this kind of movie, it always has a distinct ""made-for-TV"" feel to it. Not the case here. This mystery has all the thrills and magic of a silver screen production. In short, it delivers!Featuring an all-star cast, ""Knives Out"" is the story of one very corrupt family who lust after the patriarch's considerable wealth and holdings. And when he is discovered dead one morning, the victim of an apparent suicide, everyone is suspect. Except for his ever vigilant and dutiful nurse, who happens to be the one person who carries the most revealing secret. It falls upon private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), to uncover the dastardly crime at its core and set things right.This is more than just a throwback to a style of years gone by. Yes, it is shades of ""Murder, She Wrote"", and Agatha Christie's writings, but this is not an homage. It is a resurrection. We may be entering the next golden age of the ""Whodunit"" mystery. There are already plans of, not only a sequel, but a franchise of movies centered around Benoit Blanc. Now, the trick will be to keep the same intrigue and appeal that this movie has.I highly recommend ""Knives Out"". Even if you are of a generation that is focused on the inner workings of a crime special unit or an FBI profiler, complete with autopsies, ballistics and dna testing, you would enjoy the simplicity of this good old fashioned mystery caper.

199,elicopperman,Murder Mystery at its Most Subversive,8,5 April 2021,"When it comes to thrillers that subvert the audiences' expectations, nothing comes to mind in recent years more than Knives Out. Directed by Rian Johnson, merely two years following his infamous installment in the Star Wars sequel franchise, The Last Jedi, the film was met with rave responses from critics and audiences upon its release. In addition to receiving several prestigious award nominations and being on many critics best of the year list, the film turned out to be one of the biggest surprises of 2019 in terms of the mystery genre. After allowing it to breathe overtime and stand on its own, I can safely say that the praise was well given.Featuring an ensemble cast, the film follows a master detective named Beniot Blanc who investigates the death of a wealthy, dysfunctional family.'s patriarch, Harlan Thrombey. Now unlike most mystery thrillers, the main case of the film would mostly if not entirely take place within the main area the murder took place, that being the prestigious aristocratic household. Also, seeing the film told from the POV of mostly an entire family rather than a bunch of random detectives associated with the murdered victim is quite unique in its own regard. Admittedly, the first act of the movie is a bit slow and not all that entertaining, as it mostly just sets up each individual character and all the events leading up to Harlan's death. It doesn't help that the pacing is somewhat slow at first, causing the momentum to almost wear thin. However, as soon as Harlan's nurse Marta and grandson Hugh are given a bigger role in the story, that's when the movie really picks up and becomes highly engaging throughout. From that point on, Blanc and his partners Lieutenant Elliot and Trooper Wagner have a bigger stake on their hands.Heavily inspired by the works of Agatha Christie and debatably the revived interest of mystery films in the 1980s, the film's plot takes some very unexpected detours following what happens to Marta and Hugh. In addition to being played phenomenally well by Ana de Armas and Chris Evans, each character is somewhat of a contrast between the polarizing Thrombey family tree, with one being courteous while still cautious around them and the other being a lot more callous and even semi sadistic towards them all. It makes sense since the family can range from polite yet ignorant buffoons, to arrogant stuck up snobs, to just a handful of well meaning people, all of which are played by well known names like Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Riki Lindhome and some smaller ones too: mainly the younger ones. Every cast member brings a special amount of dimensionality to their role as the film goes on, showing the true evils of a dysfunctional wealthy household, all of which leading to a rather peculiar grandfather played by Christopher Plummer.In terms of filmmaking, the cinematography is quite impressive when it comes to the color palettes. Alongside foggy Massachusetts to emphasize the overall mood, there are plenty of scenes where the dark atmosphere adds into the tone. Nathan Johnson's musical score is usually at its most memorable during the thrills than the calmer scenes, allowing each scene to play out on its own without feeling overwhelmed by the tracks. Also, what's quite fascinating about the film is some occasional bits of sociopolitical commentary. With a lot of the Thrombey family tree ranging differently in their political beliefs, especially some of the grandchildren, some of the funnier discourse comes between the ignorant prejudices within their bloodline. Plus, as Marta is a more three dimensional role than most Latina maids in movies like this, a lot of entrenched aspects within American society end up contrasting how she becomes a very strong hero for immigrants and their offspring whose strengths come from sympathy and genuine value for the livelihood of human beings.All of these factors and more are what make Knives Out stand out tremendously from most modern day mystery thrillers, let alone its subversive narrative. With its poignant commentary on classism in America, brilliant performances, clever filmmaking and likable cast, this film might go on to inspire more filmmakers to take more interesting turns in suspense flicks, just like how Rian Johnson was influenced by the mystery films he enjoyed once upon a time. Given that a sequel is already in consideration, it's only a matter of time once we get to see what else Benoit Blanc will be uncovering soon enough.",Knives Out
200,ronakkotian,A great rejuvenation of the murder mystery genre,8,8 December 2019,"Rian Johnson is a fantastic director. Even though many criticise him for ruining Star Wars with The Last Jedi, he has proven his skill in previous films like Looper. His new film Knives Out may be his best.Knives Out follows Benoit Blanc, a detective hired to solve the mysterious death of Harlan Thrombey, the patriarch of the eccentric and conflicting Thrombey family.I'm a big fan of the murder mystery genre so I was obviously very excited to this and the ensemble cast increased my anticipation. Rian Johnson has very cleverly and skilfully put together a fantastic homage to the ""whodunnit"" genre. The film has a very old fashioned feeling to it, despite its modern aspects, that is reminiscent of murder mysteries from the 1900s and the Clue board game. The set design, cinematography and costumes built up this incredible atmosphere to the time it's set in.One of the best parts of this movie is the cast. Everyone did a fantastic job as their characters and played off one another exceptionally well. Daniel Craig, with his Southern accent, was really funny at times and his acting was really good especially during the third act. For me, personally, I thought the standout was Ana de Armas. She plays a crucial role in this story and this is the best I've seen her act.Rian Johnson's direction is fantastic throughout as he incorporates a range of style to each shot but it's not just style over substance as his script is witty, hilarious and keeps you invested through the film's entirety. His take of this genre is vastly different from whodunnits in the past which made the experience better in my opinion as I constantly doubted myself on what direction the film was taking.A character I felt was really underutilized was that of Jaeden Martell since he does not contribute much to the film compared to the rest of the cast. Apart from that I don't have any other complaints regarding this film.Knives Out is a really fun time at the theatre. Just the premise of a whodunnit is interesting enough to watch but Rian Johnson's amazing direction, script and ensemble cast make this film shine and unique from previous whodunnits in the past. This is definitely my favourite film of his and cannot wait to see what other ideas he comes up with. Knives Out is one of the best films of the year.",Knives Out

Police interviewing individuals in the huge country house, where a suspicious death took place. Said individuals all clearly needling one another and all with motives, plus one seemingly innocent bystander. This breaks with tradition pretty fast though, divulging the killer, the circumstance, the whole damn thing... or does it? It certainly leaves you thinking, where exactly is this going? Daniel Craig feels like the lynchpin, playing the gentlemanly PD with the southern accent (American, not British), but this ensemble cast really does pull its weight and it's this cast that helps with the slightly unconventional twists and turns that follow. Suspects thought innocent, repulsive heirs in shady manipulations, red herrings and theories played out onscreen, not quite to Tim Curry levels of genius, but still a lot of fun.",Knives Out

Rian Johnson clearly did a wonderful job with the directing and writing of the film. I have to admit that at first I didn't expect much out of this film. I kind of lower my expectations but at the end I became some sort of a fan. There are two things in particular that impressed me during the film: those are the characters and the plot itself. The plot is fantastic, both funny and chilling at the same time. no surprise that the genres of the film are crime, drama and comedy. but the plot and the writing are done so well that they connect to each other so good. it feels original and not forced. the viewers are not given the whole story and information about the characters but rather they need to come to conclusions on their own. the more the plot gets complicated, the more the audience needs to observe and learn what's happening. The characters are another thing to be impressed by in this movie. rather it be characters like Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) and Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans) who are a pleasure to watch on screen. or characters like Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Jacob Thrombey (Jaeden Martell) who you wish something bad happened to them. there are so many different characters that everybody can relay on and every characters with his own personalities. the movie is well shot and edited: a lot of different angels, camera movements and close ups. overall this is a highly recommended film.",Knives Out

Chris Evans, the bad-boy grandson, seems to be channeling Rupert Everett.Writer/director Rian Johnson is clearly torn between homage to Agatha Christie and a send-up. If you're going to spoof Christie, you need to spoof one of her grander whodunits like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. KNIVES OUT, with its gothic-ish country house setting, is more reminiscent of THE MOUSTRAP, Dame Agatha at her creakiest. The Sondheim-scripted THE LAST OF SHEILA (1973) was not good, but it wasn't as clunky as this.This is tosh - and really not 'quality' tosh. Mildly - very mildly - entertaining.

209,andrewroy-04316,"A wonderful whodunit with a great mystery and resolution that still subverts the genre (of course), and also completely hilarious",9,30 November 2019,"I cannot imagine someone going to see Knives Out in theaters and leaving saying that they didn't have a good time. Knives Out manages to be at once a true whodunit and also a fresh and modern take on the genre, and manages to have a great mystery, great characters and themes, and great humor. Rian Johnson's screenplays and visual touches have always been treats when I watch his movies, and they were on full display here. The script is really tight and so good, working on many levels. It is really challenging to write a good whodunit because you want to give clues to the answer but don't want to make it obvious, and this is now the primary example I'll cite of giving plenty of information as makes sense in the plot, providing some relevant red herrings, and tying it up in a way that makes perfect sense in retrospect. The script is also great because it sets up the characters really well to then show some significant social messages: how Americans can look down on immigrants, how the prospect of money can lead people to drastic and aggressive departures from seemingly more reasonable characters, the relevance and entitlement of blood relation, and the contradiction between feeling successful and superior as a result of inherited wealth while also claiming to be self-made. Seeing the movie from Marta's perspective heightened these themes and also was a way of flipping the script from the traditional whodunit detective perspective. Finally, the script is great because the movie is absolutely hilarious. I love Daniel Craig's ""CSI KFC"" detective (the lines about there being a hole in the case, like a donut, and then that hole seeming to be filled but really being another donut with a smaller hole inside the bigger donut hole, was just amazing), I love the running bit about them having no idea where Marta was from and just naming South American countries, and I love the way all the characters are played to a T, especially Nana, Joni (Collette), and Ransom (Evans).Getting into spoilers, the ending is really great. I was convinced the entire time that he had set his death up and left one last mystery for them, but that was just a really good red herring. The motive and the way Ransom acted makes a lot of sense given the unfolding of information and also ties up all loose threads very cleanly. Rather than having a twist for twist's sake, Johnson sets up a plausible and complex mystery with a legitimate solution but lots of surprises. The ending was also great in how it showed everyone in the family's focus on material wealth and never truly connecting with or caring about Harlan, while Marta did. She didn't play Go purely to win, she played to make beautiful patterns, same as how she lived with kindness. It never feels overstuffed or too complicated, but has many new twists and pieces of information that keep you thinking. The runtime absolutely flies by, as it's so energetic and funny. A great movie for everyone to watch and enjoy. This and Parasite have easily the two best scripts I've seen this year and among the stronger ones in my memory, so I'll be very sad if neither is nominated for screenplay (fairly likely).",Knives Out

50% of the mystery is solved an hour into the film. Would have been nice not knowing if he committed suicide or not that early on.

But being a Rian Johnson movie, there's more beneath the surface than the obvious callbacks and parodies. If you go into this movie feeling like you know the outcome, you're wrong. This is a mystery cliché-free zone. The movie opens with the apparent suicide of a successful murder mystery author and the subsequent gathering of his family for the funeral, memorial, and will reading. Meanwhile a private detective has been hired by an anonymous client to look further into the suicide, with the full resources of the local police department behind him.The biggest and earliest cliché dodge of the movie is in revealing the details of Harlan Thrombey's death in the first half an hour. Yes, this is a murder mystery where the murder is solved (at least for the audience) really early. It's an inspiring choice that goes a long way to setting up the rest of the movie. We then follow the cover-up underneath Benoit Blanc's nose the entire time, giving us a fresh and new perspective in an otherwise overdone and tired genre. But don't let this lull you into thinking there's no mystery to be had. The explanation we get is still riddled with holes (doughnut holes, to be more precise), and there's the ever-pervading mystery of who hired Benoit Blanc in the first place, and why. I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking it too, but no, that's not the big twist at the end either.But Knives Out's success lies in not only the unpredictable twist, but the ingenious journey there. The climax of the movie is neither plainly obvious, but nor is it a complete left hook, coming out of nowhere based on no evidence, or on evidence only Benoit Blanc has seen, or on an overabundance of evidence and red herrings, nor is it so outlandish it borders on the unbelievable. The hints and clues are there throughout the movie if you're keen enough to catch them. I caught a couple myself, but had no way of applying them or even knowing they were clues until the final reveal at the end. By the time the credits have rolled, every loose end has been neatly tied up, and every set-up paid off in one way or another. There's an obvious set-up in the prop knife, but also keep a look out for the baseball and make sure you track its movements as the movie goes on, as well as the odd line and snippet of information offered by the characters, particularly around games.There's more to Knives Out than just the murder mystery though. For starters the cinematography is electric. It may not be so obvious as some of Johnson's previous work, but there's still some great cinematic shots to enjoy. Examples include Benoit's face bathed in shadow as he lights his cigar, or Meg's illuminated eyes while on the phone to Marta. Likewise the soundtrack perfectly embodies the murder mystery genre and makes you feel right at home as soon as the movie begins. It won't win any awards, but it suits the movie and does its job.Somewhat surprisingly there's also a level of comey throughout. Never quite laugh-out-loud hilarious, but there's plenty of jokes and running gags. Daniel Craig in particular seems to be having a lot of fun with this movie, putting on an over-the-top southern drawl, and coming out with lines such as ""The Nazi child masturbating in the bathroom"" and ""The doughnut had a hole in the middle that was filled by another doughnut, your doughnut, but your doughnut also has a hole in the middle"". Surprisingly Michael Shannon has a selection of fantastic lines as well, such as ""I will not eat one iota of sh*t"" and ""You want a cookie now?!"" Chris Evans is another one quite obviously having a great time as a smarmy git, in stark contrast to his Captain America persona (sorry dude, you will always be compared to your most iconic role).On the note of acting, it was great to see Ana de Armas in the leading role (no, this is not Daniel Craig's movie), and not once did her insane attractiveness come up or be exemplified over her role in the story. She was her character and played her role like any other actor, proving that she absolutely has the acting chops capable of carrying an entire movie on her shoulders. Toni Collette is another stand-out as a privileged fashion/health guru, as is Christopher Plummer as the unfortunate Harlan Thrombey. And it was nice to actually see Frank Oz again, in his first live-action role in nearly twenty years.Knives Out was an all-round good fun movie. It'll keep you guessing up to the last, it'll keep you laughing and amused as it all unravels, and there's plenty more to mine in multiple viewings. I can't say it's the best of Rian Johnson's work, but it carries on his neverending streak of really good movies. I give Knives Out a solid 8/10.",Knives Out
216,socrates4,Fun Mystery Film,7,15 April 2020,KNIVES OUT borrows from countless other whodunit films that have come before it while still managing to put a fresh and original take on it. It's everything that's great about the genre with just the perfect amounts of satire and parody added for good measure.It's one thrill after the next. It's hilarious and a whole lot of fun. Don't try to figure it out yourself. Just enjoy the ride! Recommend.,Knives Out
217,sweidman-28016,Great 70s Homage to Classic Whodunnits,8,3 December 2019,"Knives Out stars many people and is a Rian Johnson whodunnit about a renowned crime novelist who is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday. A detective is then mysteriously enlisted to investigate. He questions and investigates everything and everyone in the house to find out what actually happened. I like Rian Johnson and his films from Looper to The Last Jedi. Naturally I was excited. However I found myself to be nervous for what was to come. Murder on the Orient Express came out two years ago and had an all star cast, similar to this, and I was really pumped for it. After watching it I was let down and kind of bored. I didn't want a repeat of that. Thankfully it's not! Johnson proves himself, yet again, as one of the best film directors in the business today. The story had so many laughs and shocking scenes. It took a different approach than a typical mystery film since we're given some information towards the beginning which confused me at first. I didn't know where it would go after that but it still managed to continue a mysterious tone and question what would happen next. The cast is just absolutely fantastic, not a single bad performance. The most notable performances for me were Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. First off, Daniel Craig's voice took me for a loop. I'm so used to his british accent that when it was a southern accent I wasn't sure if it would annoy me, but I loved it. Honestly one of the best performances of the year. Chris Evan totally changes his nice Captain America personality to a total asshole and he does it so well. Every scene was fun with him. By far the best part of the film was Ana de Armas. She was in 2049 and I really liked her in that. I didn't think she'd be in this film for most of the runtime, but thankfully she was the star of it. The score from Nathan Johnson felt like a 70s mystery show. Great choice with that. The cinematography by Steve Yedlin capture the gorgeous setting. Some of the best production design of the year. As for flaws there's a couple characters that didn't feel necessary to the plot entirely. Jaeden Martell has maybe four lines because he does nothing and the cops that come and investigate didn't do much either. LaKeith Stanfield does some interviews, but the rest felt a little insignificant. Other than a couple week characters I had a blast watching Knives Out. I don't know if it has a strong enough potential for the oscars, but with a good screenplay and beautiful set design, I think it may have some of a chance.My Grade: A-",Knives Out
218,funtasticfour,A very fun mystery,8,30 December 2019,"I'm not usually fond of this type of movie, because its usually very obvious. This story telling is unique in that you know the answer immediately...sort of. But things twist and turn, and the cast is all good in the meantime. The best part is that of the probably least famous in the cast, which is the nurse. I just love the idea that she is so against lying that she vomits, which I thought might have been faked or deceiving at the start, but I'm glad it wasn't.",Knives Out
219,Offworld_Colony,I've been a huge fan of Rian Johnson since the Brick days...,9,6 February 2020,"...and was pleased after the bashing he got from the vitriolic, entitled wing of the Star Wars ManBaby fanbase, that he bounced back with an original little indie, to much critical acclaim.It starts slow and not very engaging but it picks up immediately when the true central conceit of the film, and probably the reason why it's so vibrant and resonates with critics so much, comes to light. Ana de Armas has a key role, not shown in the trailers, and the film seems nestled half way between a retro Agatha Christie and a really really good modern TV series. It's nice to see a low-fi, subtle picture that allows its characters and dialogue and self knowledge if its genre to delight instead of effects and whizzbang.I have to say I bumped it down half a star (or maybe even a full star) because Haymarket's Odeon is horrendous, the screen tiny, dark and cloudy, the audio tinny and plonked all over the place. It's a shame that bad projection can tarnish an experience but it did. However I'm really really looking forward to watching it again at home and that counts for something in this one-and-done age of viewing films.The film is enjoyable and dark and funny and fresh. It's not astounding, but it plays very cleverly within its genre and with its audience but it never lambasts or lampoons them, it says something important about privilege and entitlement but doesn't cram it down your throat.Daniel Craig is excellent, clearly he's sick of playing damaged, dour, anti-role models and is acting up a storm and we're all loving it too. It's not a smug film, it's lovingly cheap feeling and tangible, and it's got some genuine standout callbacks and moments in it that will be remembered in film annals for a long time.A compliment in many ways to TV's Succession, a timely and exceedingly welcome joyride.",Knives Out

I expected a comedy about weird characters in a mansion trying to solve a murder. Sadly, movie takes a different turn, innovates and changes the old formula of movie like this. This is sad not because of the sole fact that the formula is changed, but because the movie felt really long and boring. It's ending is fun, but... Yeah... This is actually just a classic crime movie, with a few humorous moments. And nothing else. Having in mind the great cast, I expected so much more from this movie and can't help but to fell really disappointed. It could have been so much more! Eh... It's not a bad movie.... It's an OK movie... But not a great one for sure. 6.5/10! It can still be fun and give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much, because you simply won't find it here...",Knives Out

223,acedj,Good but not great,7,20 January 2020,"Here we have a murder mystery done in the style of Agatha Christie. It is smartly written and was one of very very very few movies like this where I was kept guessing throughout. An accomplished author named Harlan Thrombey dies and the police rule it a suicide. Before they can close the case though a renowned private detective named Benoit Blanc shows up claiming he has been hired to find a murderer. The whole family is suspect and the home nurse that took care of Harla, Marta, is pulled in to help try and sort out who that might be.
This movie has such an amazing cast of some very accomplished and respected actors, there was no way in hell it would fail. I loved the many twists it took to reach the final unveiling of who killed Harlan. This movie should have been a 10, but I knocked off three stars for two reasons. The first and foremost is while Daniel Craig is a great actor, having him adopt an American accent was a poor choice. He neither does it well nor convincingly. Second there were some points where it felt like it dragged on just a bit. I think the editing team could have trimmed some fat. Other than that I could find no flaws in this film.",Knives Out

Out', by adding one more question 'who sent the letter to hire the private detective?', the depth of conundrum gets deeper and the mystery gets layered. When I was watching this movie, the director does a good job of navigating through mystery 'with' the audience and of making them engaged and tense. However, after the movie, I do not have the feeling of clarity with the results and closure. As I go over the plot, I keep asking questions to each character's intention, action, and the motive once again because the screenplay does not persuade me.",Knives Out

I suspect writer/director Rian Johnson of attempting to sneak in a political message, but if so it is completely drowned out by the noise of merrily preposterous whodunnitry.Daniel Craig is a very good actor, so he gets away with being miscast as a Deep-South detective. Everybody else is effortlessly perfect, but it's really Ana de Armas' movie. She's excellent as the nurse to an uber-successful author (Christopher Plummer) whose family assembles for a get-together which was never going to turn out well. Ms de Armas' endearing rabbit-in-the-headlights quality belies a brilliantly controlled performance.Lots of delights elsewhere. Great to see Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Don Johnson enjoying themselves so much. Interesting to see Chris Evans out of his Captain America uniform. K Callan has very few lines but reliably steals every scene she's in.

236,david-meldrum,An Absolute Blast,8,4 December 2019,"When news broke that Renée Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones, I remember mutterings and complaints from British critics and audiences; couldn't an up and coming British actor have been given such the opportunity? What sort of mess would the American make of the accent? Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were cast opposite her and despite the complaints and suspicions, the film was a huge hit, spawned sequels and it now seems rather quaint to think about these complaints at all.This was in the back of mind approaching Knives Out. Director Rian Johnson directs a starry American cast (and Daniel Craig, sporting an occasionally inconsistent Southern accent) in a film he also wrote that was to be a homage to the British murder mystery in general and Agatha Christie in particular. I could imagine some of the genre most loyal fans getting uptight about an American take on British traditions, but I hadn' t heard many of these complaints - may be, Brexit and Trump notwithstanding - we're all a bit more internationally-minded now.In any case, it really doesn't matter. Knives Out is a blast. The plot is a finely constructed work of crystalline beauty; each performance from the stellar cast is given at least a few moments in the sun; the denouement has more than one 'aha!' moment as revelations fall into place; and there are more laugh out loud moments than in many comedies, all of which occur without taking the viewer out of the moment, undercutting the drama. To cap it all, the film also works - and is clearly intended to, especially in light of the ending - as a metaphor for how immigration and precisely the sort of nationalism which turned its nose up at the thought of an American Bridget Jones; but it's not a metaphor that dominates the film, nor is it an overtly political one.What it is, is a very, very entertaining film which has - if those who need to say yes to such things do so - the clear capacity to produce a sequel or three. It's one of those films likely to be enjoyed by people who don't go to the cinema, to be discussed over Christmas dinner (rather than the politics), to be curled up with in a couple of years in the week between Christmas and New Year.",Knives Out

238,cgvsluis,Well done mystery!,8,8 November 2020,"This was a visually stunning, tightly told mystery with a phenomenal cast. The story was very well crafted with great details that give the viewer a false sense of security. The audience gets to see the details of the murder right at the beginning and our best witness has a condition that has her projectile vomiting if she even thinks about telling a lie. The cast of characters are not only well dressed but full of quirks that have you paying attention to the little details. This is a mystery inside of a mystery...or a donut with a hole inside another donut with a hole, as our tenacious and very southern New Yorker profiled detective would say.The story has us following along with an immigrant nurse who's aging successful mystery writer employer, played by Christopher Plummer, has just been found to have committed suicide and she has been asked along with the rest of the household and family members to come back to the house, a large secluded Victorian, to be reinterviewed by the police about the night of the suicide. In attendance with the local police is a new face, that of Daniel Craig's character...the successful southern detective who has been hired anonymously to look in to the suicide. Right away you discover he has a knack for telling truth from lies...and does appear quite good at his job.Shortly after the start of the film, we discover that our sweet, kind and caring nurse, who everyone seems to love and say is a part of their family, made a mistake in her employer's nightly medication...giving him a deadly dose of morphine. In thinking he has just 10 minutes left to live helps her figure out a way to not get blamed for his murder.Thus sets up the true story of our protagonist, who has accidentally killed her employer, vs our antagonist, our dogged detective who uses her to help him get to the bottom of the crime in a unique and fun cat and mouse game that has us rooting for our sweet and innocent little mouse.A lot of dark humor is written in to the script including the ongoing joke that no one in the family seems to know where our nurse and her family are from...other than somewhere south of the border...Brazil? Ecuador?, every time it is a different country. But my favorite bit is when Plummer's character first hears about the medication mishap, he is all 'hey, that's a great idea for an upcoming book!' and starts writing it down.This was a great tightly told story, with a lot of attention paid it the details, it has a phenomenal cast with great acting and beautiful costumes and sets.I highly recommend giving it a viewing.",Knives Out

It is a stylish movie, but the story is actually rather lame and unexciting when you take away the A-list actors and the glossy finish. Besides, a few key scenes don't really make sense, but have to be that way because the plot wouldn't work otherwise (meeting dangerous people in dark alleys instead of crowded places type of stuff).
It was also impossible to miss the racial undertones. The makers of the film were obviously drawing a metaphor for the demographic shift in America, clearly expressing their satisfaction with a certain majority being on the way out.

249,vjnambu,First film I saw alone in theatre,9,1 December 2019,"Knives out is the first film ever in my life which I was the only person in theatre. I knew there won't be crowd to watch this because it's a content driven film and not any comic book or franchise film. Why I wanted to see knives out was for Chris Evans. I am his fan since he played captain America. He made that character iconic. Usually Chris Evans non MCU films(whether lead or supporting roles) don't do well critically or commercially. But when knives out got critical acclaim, I got ready to book my ticket. I had to book my ticket in advance so that they don't cancel the show. I came for 5:30 show but film they were not playing after 5 minutes. I had to call the operator and make him play and he played it.
Now coming to the film, knives out is a murder mystery where Daniel Craig has come to investigate the death of a murder mystery novelist. I am used to watch mystery thrillers so I am familiar with its format. Knives out follows the exact format but suspense was revealed in the middle itself. It has a ensemble cast and everyone have performed well. Daniel Craig was enjoying a lot playing Benoit blanc. Ana de armas got a meaty role and has played well the sincere caretaker. Veterans Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon kept their names. Now coming to the man for whom I had to sit in an empty theatre. When Evans appeared I was so happy. He made the film more enjoyable. It was good that he didn't get lost among all the stalwarts.
But, I had issue with the ending which could have been better. Many of the things done went in vain.

251,fciocca,A well made Giallo that adds something new to the formula.,7,10 October 2021,"""Knives Out"" is a movie that I have genuinely enjoyed. This is a major Giallo feature film, with a well written script that kept me entertained for a couple of hours. The movie has the perfect length, and by the end you have the solution of the case. The director exploited the well working narrative formula, used for decades, and mixed it with some modern storytelling and editing techniques: he added his personal touch. This is why it works so well in my opinion. There are certain plot twists that really surprised me, by changing the entire perspective of the story. It never takes itself too seriously and there are many funny jokes that actually made me laugh. I do not even remember when I felt like this while watching a big production released in recent years.Daniel Craig completely stole the scene, confirming once again his talent. I really like his interpretation of the detective Benoit Blanc with the almost comical British accent. His name is a clear reference to Poirot. I am actually very surprised by how many big actors were involved in this production: Ana De Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon and Chris Evans are just a few examples. Performances were absolutely astonishing, but with a cast like this one, I was not expecting otherwise.I wish that Hollywood would consider making more films like this one. Just good and simple stories where cinema lovers like me can lay back and enjoy the ride. In the end when I watch a movie this is all I want, without having a forced political agenda in it. ""Knives Out"" accomplished this perfectly.",Knives Out
252,Med-Jasta,Is Rian Johnson capable of making a good movie?,1,19 August 2020,Having seen all of his movies with the exception of his Star Wars (I have very strong views on SW) I have seen everything that he's done somehow. And I can honestly say that he is incapable of making a good movie. He is the perfect example of a film student where he's seen everything and has analyzed the techniques and methods but doesn't understand the art behind them. He didn't understand the feeling and why those great directors did what they did.In his attempt to be artiste he comes across as disingenuine and contrived. He really loves Wes Anderson and tries to copy his camera style without coming up with his own style in the process. He doesn't use inspiration as a launching pad he uses it as a Bible to follow. And he tries to give his characters a trait like the Cohen's but when it's every character it doesn't come across as natural.And his humor is terrible. Either the timing or the writing I don't know but he can't do it.Writers and directors use their instincts to feel what is right and wrong and I think Johnson looks at every single word and moment and analyses it to understand the effect it will have. He has no instincts. He has no style. He should be directing TV show episodes where he belongs.This movies exemplifies all of his bad qualities.,Knives Out
253,DeBBss,A unique take on the murder mystery genre,7,27 March 2021,"Knives Out is a very solid movie. It has an interesting plot that takes a twist with the murder mystery genre. I'm not going to spoil it, but there are some obviously great plot twists that you'd never see coming. Knives Out is also very well produced. The directing and cinematography was top notch and it helped express the murder mystery tone/atmosphere a lot.The cast is also insane. With so many A-list actors, you'd expect great performances, and fortunately, every actor had a solid performance. The pacing is good too; it starts off a little slow, but by the end, it ramps up quickly and we then get a conclusion.In every murder mystery, there are several characters who have motives to kill, therefore adding tension and mystery. But the only issue I have is that all of the characters seemed like normal people. I think the characters should've been more creepily written, something like the Addams family or the family from Ready or Not. It just seemed like no one was crazy enough to actually kill somebody, so it somewhat ruined the mystery for me.Overall, Knives Out is a 7/10 from me. The mystery aspect could've been done a little bit better, but the plot is unique enough to keep you going. Other than that, the acting, atmosphere, and pacing are great. I'd definitely give this film a recommendation to everyone.",Knives Out
254,jayjaycee,High gloss polished entertainment,8,2 November 2020,"""Knives Out"" is a 2019 comedic crime drama directed by Rian Johnson starring Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig.
âª
All in all, Rian Johnson's take on the classic whodunnit outflings a fine collection of high gloss polished thrusting weapons, and every single one stabs precisely in the correct spots, as the cleverly twisted writing, the star-studded cast, the decent acting and the marvellous directing make for an ingenious and brilliantly constructed game of chess that, despite some narrative difficulties in the second act, leaves you astray smartly in most points and surprises you more than you will expect, entertains with its sheer star power and causes you to chuckle for its extreme cunning, thus making it a pleasant and successfully modernised work of a crime drama a la Agatha Christie.
âª
Now that Spooktober has ended and I can go back to watching non-horror films, I thought I'd start the new month with a more or less recent film. To me personally, Rian Johnson is indeed a capable director who knows to create unusual films and works. I liked his somewhat controversial direction in ""The Last Jedi"", and the ""Breaking Bad"" episodes ""Fly"" and ""Ozymandias"" are two of the cleverest crafted episodes of the enitre show. Many might not appreciate his works the way I do, so I assume that this film has a lot of bashers as well, but I for one liked it a lot. First of all, look at this amazing cast! Next to Ana De Armas, who should have received top billing in my opinion, you have a dozen of Hollywood's finest artists working. Next to modern James Bond Daniel Craig (as the subtly hilarious sleuth), you have Laurie Strode actress Jamie Lee Curtis, veteran actor Christopher Plummer as the patriarch, the heavily underrated Michael Shannon, ""Hereditary"" star Toni Collette, ""Sorry To Bother You"" lead actor LaKeith Stanfield, ""Miami Vice"" icon Don Johnson, ""13 Reasons Why"" superstar Katherine Langford, ""It"" youngster Jaeden Martell, ""Garfunkel & Oates"" satirist Riki Lindhome and even ""Captain America"" himself, Chris Evans, in a role where he uses a lot of language. The acting power behind this film is astonishing, and honestly, it is one of the finest casts I have ever seen in a feature film. Even if it turns out that most of the prominent names play only a minor role and in fact appear for a surprisingly little amount of time, seeing those utterly talented artists acting out their scenes is just marvellous. However, credit where credit is due, I think that Cuban beauty and wonderful actress Ana de Armas plays her role wonderfully. I mean, you see how many renowned and legendary actors and actresses star alongside her - only imagine trying to hold your ground in the presence of those legends and furthermore succeeding to play the protagonist excellently. She is the lynchpin of this fantastically twisted whodunit, and I can imagine her winning an Oscar in the next few years if she continues delivering so delightfully. Though the acting power in this film is one of the film's biggest strengths, it is the writing that perfectly rounds it up. Rian Johnson constructed a detailed and shrewd murder mystery reminiscent of the board game ""Clue"" and old-school Agatha Christie novels, and even if you can see that he obviously paid a tribute to those two influences, he knows to give it a personal and modern touch as well. The premise is quite simple: a patriarch dies untimely, and his family are suspected to have something to do with it, but regardless of this undeniable simplicity, the execution and further development make it so utterly ingenious. It is admirable how Johnson misleads the viewer multiple times and toys with their reception throughout. If it was murder, as detective Benoit Blanc suspects, all relatives, children and in-laws alike, would have a motif, but then something happens that makes this film set itself apart from the classic stories: three-quarters of an hour into the film it turns out that de Armas' character Marta, a nurse for the patriarch, injected him the wrong medicine. I was shocked to see that the mystery was solved after not even an hour and thought ""Why would he do that?"" and similar things. In the end, there turns out to be a second twist, but before it gets there, the audience is seemingly enlightened concerning the passing of their family member. And that is also one of the films minor flaws, because even if it ends up being a smart move, it inevitably effects the subsequent plot a lot. For most of the time, it seems like the case is closed, and as a consequence, I felt abruptly stopped. At first, I felt intrigued and wondered what the final revelation will bring to light, but then it is all suddenly disentangled. Thus, it lost a lot of steam and took a comparatively long time to regain its eagerly build up speed. Thankfully, the final reveal somewhat makes up for it. Even if it was an unusual and turn, it is no excuse for messing up the pacing and plot in the second act that much. Nevertheless, the ingenuity behind everything easily makes it bearable. There is a twist within the twist (insert Inception noise here) and that puts a different complexion on it. Seriously, you will not see it coming, because the love for detail and the way it gives away its details are stunning. If you think that it is all, there is furthermore a message behind everything as well, as it states that kind-heartedness is much more worth than greed and money. Thus, the film became even more touching. The greedy relatives who only used their rich father for their own causes come away empty-handed, unlike the one person who in fact deserves everything of the heritage. In the end, it's an enjoyable crime mystery that convinces with its story rather than with its cast, as it, as a matter of fact, only serves as some kind of bait, because as wonderful as they all interact, it is not essential for the film to work out. Overall, a marvellous and rewatchable experience that will please genre fans tremendously.",Knives Out
255,TheHoodOfSwords,Great Mystery Film,8,19 March 2020,"I haven't seen a lot of who-dunnit movies in a while. However I gotta say that this was pleasantly enjoyable. I think that the first hour of the movie or so is a tad bit too slow. I get that it is supposed to be a mystery, but it feels like a slow drag. It definitely picks up at the end though. I enjoyed the acting, although the characters were quite basic, I'm giving it a pass as that is kind of a staple for films like this. I found Daniel Craig's accent to be a bit jarring at times, and I don't think it was polished quite as well as it could have been, but after hearing it for 15 minutes or so you get used to it. Chris Evans character was my favorite by far. Overall, a fun murder mystery film.",Knives Out
256,x_manicure_x,Lightheartedly fun,7,14 August 2021,"""Knives Out"" is a murder mystery as well as it is a family drama kind of comedy. Rian Johnson's take on whodunits is bold and refreshing, but most of the pleasure comes from the interactions between characters. It's not easy to work with an ensemble cast without leaving out anyone, but this film does a great job providing brief but clear-cut portraits of each character so that we have all the information we need. Credit for bringing the story to life so vividly also goes to the excellent performances of the stellar cast.The lighthearted, witty tone helps the viewer digest the over-the-top moments and the surreal elements, while the fine cinematography and sharp script give us the impression of being watching something classy and sophisticated. Overall the film is not as smart as it thinks to be, but still a brilliant and entertaining comedy played by a great cast.",Knives Out

director: Rian Johnson
starring: Daniel Craig,Chris Evans,Jamie Lee curtis,Ana De Armas,Toni Colette,Michael Shannon,Don Johnson,Christopher Plummer,Katherine Langford,Jaeden Martell etcoverall rating 100/100Knives out is about a suspected suiscide from Harlan Thrombey ( Christopher Plummer) on his 85th birthday with all of his family. But a murder investigation takes place when many members of his family and his nurse have motives for killing him and its down to detective Benoit Blanc ( Daniel craig) to figure this confusing case out. Wow what a phenomenal and clever film i could find no flaws. Lets talk about what made this film so fantastic.I have to start with the fantastic mise en scene cinematography. There was one clever line in the film that said that the Thrombey household manor looked like a massive cluedo board,and that's exactly what it looked like. The house was so big and had so many different parts to it that you didn't know where all the evidence could be. And there was so many different hidden doors and windows that increased the intrigue and entertainment value of the movie. And there was just so many clever uses of cinematography involving Daniel Craigs character that was fantastic. Including the wheel of knives and when he lit a cigarette and you could only see the fire and not his face. using low key lighting very effectively.Next the film was very funny and its mysterious tone was fantastic. The films humour was very clever in making you think one thing but then it being the complete opposite to what you thought. And also Daniel craigs charecter bought a lot of witty humour,the whole cast was funny in there own ways,due to them being oblivious as to how selfish and stupid they sound. i found this very amusing especially with Toni Calettes character.And also the script was fantastic,and the plot twists were perfectly executed. Wow the script was incredibly clever and in my opinion deserving of oscars. It consistently kept you entertained and invested in the story. And made you constantly ask questions about the film that was always answered and developed therefore leaving you very satisfied. It also had good social and political commentary as well. And the films plot twists was fantastic. The film completely turned the murder mystery on its head about halfway through the film which i love. But also it did such a convincing job at convincing you who killed the main character. But then it out of the blue was Chris Evans charecter which came as a complete surprise to me.And my final few main positives are the cast,performances and a the key standout performance of Daniel Craig. Can we all just appreciate one of the most impressive casts i have seen in a film in a long time. With so many big names everyone got there moment to shine which was great. And all the performances from everyone was solid. Especially Toni collete who played her annoying character perfectly. And Jamie lee curitis who also played her arrogant character very well with some humourous moments. And two of the three leads Chris Evans and Ana De armas did fantastic and convincing jobs in portraying the murderer and the falsely accused killer. But for me the main standout was Daniel Craig. He really made this film fantastic. Whether it was just the pure skill and talent that his character had as a detective. Or his witty humour and his fantastic accent he really made this movie.Overall Knives out is a truly fantastic. Clever and well put together movie. With fantastic performances and an incredibly well thought out and inquisitive script that deserves oscar nominations. And is truly my favourite movie of the year and up there with the best i have ever seen.",Knives Out
258,TheHonestCritic,"Everyone, be prepared to break out your knives. This is one sharp movie!",8,2 December 2019,"""Knives Out"" (2019), I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie when I first saw the trailer, because it didn't look that special to me. Also, after seeing that Rian Johnson, director of the train wreck known as ""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" (2017), wrote, produced and directed it, that didn't make it any more promising either. Then when I saw the cast, and looked at a spoiler-free synopsis for this movie on IMDB, I thought: ""okay, I'll go see it! Why not?"" I had some free time, so I went to go see it in the theater, and I'm glad I did. This movie was nothing short of excellent! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, and perfect sets/locations. The only drawback though was the soundtrack. Now, it doesn't hurt the movie in any way, but it's your typical mystery theme and it's nothing to really write home about. During most of the movie, there is little to no music at all. They could have just kept the music out of the movie itself and just saved it for the opening and end credits. I would have honestly been satisfied either way! In fact, some of the songs used don't quite match the tone of the film. But as I said, it does not ruin the movie in any way and it does it's job, but with a lower standard. The story was very well done, it pulled me in and got me hooked within the first five minutes! It's just another ""Who Done it?"" film, but with a twist. But, to my surprise, it really worked! Most movies are just recycled plot lines, but the key is to add something new and fresh to a story told a thousand times before. There's even a big twist at the end that you won't see coming, it was quite a surprise! The casting is great, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ana de Armas, that's just to name a few. It's a phenomenal cast, and they all perform their characters perfectly. Now, a lot of you know that Daniel Craig is my least favorite James Bond actor. Having said that, it doesn't mean he can't act well in other movies. I like him as an actor overall, but Bond is a bad fit for him. He can act, there's no question about it. His performance in this movie was great! But the only nitpick is his over-the-top accent. I didn't expect to hear him talk with an accent like that in this film. It kind of sounded like he was doing a Morgan Freeman voice impression! But, just like Dick Van Dyke's over the top English accent in ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), it doesn't distract from the performance. The special effects are top-notch, which is usually a given in modern cinema. Finally, the sets/locations were well done, and nicely laid out. Also, the sets/locations really set the tone for the story! This movie was very well done, and I was pleasantly surprised. Director Rian Johnson has really redeemed himself with this movie! It is worth seeing in the theater, and worth buying on DVD. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Knives Out"", go see it. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed at all!",Knives Out
259,gavinp9,Fun and well-executed mystery,7,24 November 2019,"'Knives Out' is a mostly-light-hearted timeless ensemble ""whodunnit?"" Essentially, Blanc (Craig), Elliott (Stanfield) and Wagner (Segan) are investigating the death of the patriarch of the Thrombey family, Harlan (Plummer). Thankfully, there's plenty of flashbacks in the first hour, so Plummer does get some screen time. We then meet the extended family and start to unravel various potential motives and inconsistencies in their stories.The cast is huge and all solid - Marta (de Armas) as Harlan's nurse, Linda (Lee Curtis) and Walt (Shannon) as Harlan's children; Richard (Johnson), Joni (Collette) and Donna (Lindhome) as their partners; Randsom (Evans), Meg (Langford) and Jacob (Martell) as Harlan's grandchildren. I think that the main 12 characters - needless to say, not everyone gets enough time to shine, as the focus is on Blanc and Marta trying to piece everything together.This is Johnson's first film since 'The Last Jedi' and it's very assured - excellent set design and cinematography, with a simple score. The hose is literally a life-size Cluedo game. The film drags a tiny bit in the 2nd act, but comes home strong. There's plenty of fun had by the cast and Craig clearly relishes the non-Bond role - even if his Southern accent gets annoying at times! Satisfying ending - nothing revolutionary, but enjoyable. I think we'll be seeing more of Ana de Armas in the future.",Knives Out

262,msunando,Everyone has a motive,9,1 December 2019,"Knives Out - When you've been yearning for a murder mystery of substance for years, comes Knives Out to satiate all your hunger. It's intriguing, thick with a plot, has star appeal, is mounted on a lavish scale and is taut. It may not exactly be an edge of the seat thriller, but it has all the commercial aspects that keep the viewers glued on, pretty much like the yesteryear Hitchcock or Agatha Christie novels.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in the morning following a family party, everyone is a suspect because each family member allegedly has a motive. The police however want to believe that it's a case of suicide and move on. Enter detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who has been hired by an anonymous client interested to solve the case, the investigation starts taking sinister turns and no one is spared. The private nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) remains a central character as in her lies the answer to a number of questions and she can help take Blanc to solve the mystery.Director Rian Johnson spins an interesting web of lies, smokescreen and deception. There are ample avenues and attempts to steer the viewers away from making intelligent guesses about the real motive and the potential murderer and he is quite successful in achieving the objective. The conclusion and climax are quite unorthodox and uncomfortable. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Don Johnson and Toni Collette in very important roles, Knives Out makes for a compelling watch. It will fill you with an appreciation for the runaway story, depth of characters, detailed scripting and screenplay and the rich backdrop. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas walk away with the honours in the histrionics department and Nathan Johnson must be applauded for the original music. Must watch film for everyone.",Knives Out

264,gustheaffen,Enjoyable: they go after everyone,7,25 December 2019,"I enjoyed the old school Agatha Christie mysteries and this was reminiscent. They did interject some politics but I'd say they went after both sides. They were throwing insults at SJWs, alt right and putting both sides of immigration out there while a rich entitled liberal family fought for their fathers estate. Depending your political beliefs you could see whatever which was equally brilliant, the story and characters were entertaining. If anything I'd say the family characters weren't hugely developed but at a run time of 2 hours 10 minutes the point was made. I don't know the intent of the writing though knowing Hollywood politics I can make some assumptions and I still found it very enjoyable and funny. If you can't laugh at it you won't like it.",Knives Out
265,kermitkid,Overrated,7,26 June 2020,"For the most part, this is a pretty good movie, but it doesn't really get going until the second half. However, once again, Rian Johnson cannot keep his politics out of the script. (And this is coming from someone who for the most part will defend ""The Last Jedi."" (minus Admiral purple hair Holdo)) So much of it is focused on debates about immigration, and other politics. Why couldn't this have just been a mystery movie? When it satirizes the mystery stuff, it's done well, but, again, the political commentary is eye-rolling and distracting. I will say, Chris Evans was robbed of an Oscar nomination. His performance is by far the best one here, and this is a pretty star-studded cast! (It's kind of funny to hear him cursing, and at one point saying the F word, because of how many times he told people to watch their language in Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's some dang irony!) Daniel Craig's Southern accent is hilariously bad, and even the film points that out. I don't know if that was intentional, or if they just put Craig in this for name recognition. Either way, it was kind of weird. The political stuff is most likely why this nearly has a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes and why it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, even though the film itself is just kind of average.

266,Rendanlovell,Nice character mystery,8,29 November 2019,"I like that this is less about whodunnit and more about WHOdunnit.
It's a predictable movie, but it seems almost designed that way. There's a lot of little twists and turns the film takes like a letter having invisible ink proving an affair or a character trying hopelessly to destroy evidence. While these things may be predictable or even plot devicey, it oddly didnt bother me much. I think that's because the movie has such an infectious personality. It's shot super well, the music is wonderful, and the cast has so much charisma. But the crowning achievement is the characters and the snappy dialogue they are given. All the characters have distinct personalities and motivations. Watching the characters interact is easily the most entertaining part. I really watching this surface level family slowly turn on themselves revealing how horrible they really are. They are all nice, but not really. They are all self made, but not really. The only truly good person is our main character and it's satisfying to watch her traverse this families mine field. You may not like the slightly lofty approach it takes but it works way better here then in Star Wars.",Knives Out

Flawless acting by a great cast, beautifully directed in this over-the-top story. Lots of twists. Utterly satisfying.",Knives Out

Plus, after the initial shock, you get used to Daniel Craig's accent.",Knives Out
269,ayoreinf,Some personal points I have to make,9,9 December 2019,"Starting with the title, a painful issue here in Israel. Since the title is determined by the distributers of the movie, not by the translators, we here end up repeatedly with travesties such as this. How does one make Knives Out, which is not a precise idiom in Hebrew, but does have a close enough meaning as is, into A Well Written Murder. I'm sorry, but the answer here is beyond me and I suspect there's none. I suppose I should be used to this problem with movies titles, but I never am.As for the movie itself. It's a good dark comedy, with a stellar cast that justifies its casting. They all perform superbly, most of all Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. But one must also mention Daniel Craig who gets to play a cartoon character, and still manages to come out OK. Every time he spoke, I kept remembering Tony Curtis in Some Like it Hot, when he lampooned Cary Grant, pretending to be a made up oil billioner and Jack Lemmon reacted ""Nobody speaks like that"". Nobody speaks the way Craig spoke in this movie, it was just one more aspect of making him a cartoon, a cardboard cut out for the excentric detectives the Agatha Christie school of detective literature loves so much. Unlike all other characters here, which are cartoons of real people, Craig is a cartoon of literary tradition implanted in the movie. Considering this, he does his job as well as could be expected.One last point - the political aspect. Yes, one can't understand it without the contemporary beckground, and I think it's a mistake, limiting the movie. But I can also see the point the movie's creators were trying to make - xenophobia and bigotry arn't limited to red necks and to the lower tiers of society. In fact they are much more insidious when practiced by the upper echelons of society. I can see this point, I may even agree with this opinion, but it didn't have to take such a significant role in the movie. Taking the detective literture and satirizing it, may call for barbs directed toward the aristocracy, it doesn't mean it has to sound so much like a current affairs debate on TV. As far as I'm concerned, this was the only fault of this lovely movie, I'd rate it even higher without it.",Knives Out
270,WalkdenEntertainment,"Knives Out is new, fresh and fun!",9,15 March 2020,"Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by a mystery person to investigate the death of well know crime writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Harlan was found dead on the night of his 85th birthday after celebrating with his close family. Now it's up to the detective to investigate and question Harlan's dysfunctional family to find the truth about his death.Knives Out is a film that gets going right at the start. I say this because at the beginning of this film, Harlan is already dead. As an audience, we gain an understanding of Harlan's death and the events leading up to it thanks to flashbacks from each of Harlan's family members during questioning. Speaking of Harlan's family members, there are many of them in this film and the actors all do an incredible job. Actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Chris Evans and Michael Shannon are just some of the great actors who play murder suspects.Watching the detective investigate and question each of the family members is easily one of the biggest and most entertaining elements to this film. Watching characters try to hide secrets or provide their version of the birthday dinner before Harlan's death is simply creative and interesting to watch.Another element I enjoyed was the overall mystery and plot. In movies today there has been a recent wave of murder mysteries but most of these have been remakes. Thankfully Knives Out (2019) is something new and fresh. I'm also surprised at how times I found this film funny as well as sometimes suspenseful because of the mystery and characters. The pacing and movie timeline was also different instead of being just another ""who done it"" tale.Visuals I also couldn't fault. Lots of clever filming styles are used here and there is constant and solid creativity from the director for both audio and visuals.Complaints? Very little actually. With a such a large cast, not all well-known actors share the screen time as much as our leads do (which is expected). Daniel Craig is fantastic, but I did find his accent here a little distracting at times. Other elements that didn't sit well with me requires me to give spoilers and I'm not doing that today.Overall, Knives Out is simply a film full of fun. It's humourous, but also a serious murder mystery. Characters are great and stunning to see on screen. The murder mystery itself is also satisfying, especially if you are seeking a fresh ""who done it"" murder mystery. Knives Out is new, it's fresh, it's great. 8.8/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Knives Out

I am really sad that the old man died only because of a misunderstanding but whatever now Marta is the new Queen.

272,movieman6-413-929510,A murder mystery film in which the hints and traces of error are too unclear.,4,24 November 2019,"Knives Out is a new crime drama directed, written and partly produced by Rian Johnson, the director of Looper and Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi.In the film, the successful crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead on his estate. Harlan recently had his 85th birthday which makes all the guests of his birthday party a suspect of the murder. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is now trying to investigate what happened and who is responsible for the death of Harlan Thrombey.This film is a new murder mystery film such as the 1985 film Clue, the film version of the board game Cluedo. As a viewer you try to discover together with the detective who is responsible for the death of the murdered character. Unfortunately, as a viewer you get more information about the murder mystery at a time than the characters in the film itself. So as a viewer you already know a little more than the characters and you can start to get ahead of the story. Rian Johnson tries to confuse you as a viewer with astray. Many of these traces are unfortunately not appropriately or clearly brought forward in the film, which means that final disclosures may seem somewhat unclear. Because of this lack of clarity, the film comes across as somewhat lengthy. With the film they try to explain everything to the viewers at the end, but this goes against the self-examination for which fans of murder mystery films watch such films.The cast of this film consists of many great actors and actresses such as Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Christopher Plummer. Daniel Craig uses a separate accent in the film all the time, which sometimes makes him look more comical than really as a serious detective. Of the cast, Ana de Armas comes out best in the film as the maid of the deceased. As maids, she plays a major role in gathering information about the murder mystery, because she knows all the family members and worked for them. Furthermore, Michael Shannon manages to provide a few comic moments in the film as the youngest son of the deceased.",Knives Out

Daniel Craig is seriously miscast as the all-knowing and complicit detective. How, ffs, are we to take this piece that mixes outright ridiculous scenarios - e.g. a privately employed PI telling the real law what to do, when etc. We have caricature cardboard cutouts of murder-mystery stereotypes, dreadful script and extremely poor plotting. We are left looking at all the gewgaws and other props that don't seem to have any significance or interest value to the characters. Two giant eyeballs on sticks, for example? We have the servant good, employer bad shtick given the modern racist wash but we've had enough of that laundry. Frankly, the whole enterprise is a bore-a-thon.

Never felt it so obvious and agitating than when I saw ""The Irishman."" And I felt it with this, although it didn't bother me so much.The characters have been seen before in very close proximity to these. Almost cliche. But real people across the board are repetitive and cliche, too.One element bothered me, though. The blood test of the corpse. I know these characters are under pressure and don't think straight. But I'm not under pressure and I see these things when they come up.The be-all and end-all of the blood work getting out didn't rest with that one sheet of paper. They could be done again. They were likely in a database. Now these characters might not have thought of that. But it's true.And then the nurse Marta is confronted by Chris Evans to tell the truth or she will vomit. ""So tell me."" Logic would dictate that she'd then say nothing as she wasn't under any obligation to speak, even for optics like in the initial interviews. But she did.The final scene's PAYOFF was very good...but the set-up made little sense. Specifically when Chris Evans went after Marta and plunged the knife into her chest...but with a retractable blade.Very funny! But why would that art piece of many knives have a retractable blade? And most of the knives on it clearly were not such due to the shapes.Very enjoyable nonetheless. Hope you're reading this AFTER you've seen it, though.",Knives Out

The all-star cast shines as Christopher Plummer, Don Johnson, Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and the rest of the cast bring out their respective roles as the characters involved who try to get their wits together for their own ends. Humor permeates throughout and Daniel Craig navigating through his Southern drawl just wins. And Ana de Armas' comely doe-eyed innocence is endless eye candy.

288,berg-74532,I was so excited and it's not what I expected,6,13 June 2020,"I looked a at couple of reviews and in one, a 10 star they mentioned trolls, trolls, trolls and I thought why do people rip a good movie. My conclusion, to be dicks and to trash something other people like gives them some sort of power they lack in real life. Now though I'm completely on board with these so called trolls at least in this instance. I had two or three mild chuckles that's it, it could be that I expected to much but even if I did I would expected at least one or to real laughs but no, no not even one. The political message was clear and totally acceptable. Evil white rich people, poor undocumented nurse, granted maybe the worst on screen depiction of a nurse since nurse Ratchet in Cuckoos Nest. The nurse is also a plot hole and I'm fairly certain that they changed the nurse character to an undocumented Brazilian to give it some kind of political message. Before you get upset that I'm trying to trivialize the open borders issue the reason I believe that is simple what money grubbing entitled mildly racist family would put a nurse who clearly has no credentials verifying that she even is a nurse in charge of keeping the billionaire patriarch of the unemployed family of leeches. While it is true that the family seems not to know this but that to shows this was not something that was always part of the nurse character. And if your thinking she was such a sweet girl no ones would know this. Simone this wealthy has a bubble of protection and while his family is filled with bad people the lawyer was clearly not corrupt and looked out for the best interest of his client. One last thing on that if she was an undocumented guest of the US she would do whatever she could not to let anyone know she was undocumented so for her to take a job at a place that I'm sure would do background checks on a maid, gardener, chauffeur they would most certainly do a check on a person giving injections of narcotics to someone. I have no problem with this political message but to shoehorn it sloppily in to this movie was ridiculous. And this was not a movie made from a book as evidenced by the Oscar for best original screenplay. While it was not as funny as I expected I like something's about it well one thing I believe this could be some kind of franchise around Daniel Craigs detective character. I absolutely hate when characters have accents for no reason and his was no exception but it didn't overshadow his character and he didn't use Cajun idioms like "" that dog don't hunt "" he was a detective that happened to have an accent not a guy with an accent who happened to be a detective. It might be a stretch to make it a franchise but Mr. Craig is a draw and as far as I'm concerned he was the best character and gave the best performance in this movie. Michael Shannon Toni Collette we're wasted but it a huge cast so that happens. I have to say this, oh my god did Jamie Lee Curtis you have to like a female movie star that hasn't had so many surgeries that she looks like a snare drum and with how in Hollywood you have women playing grandmothers when they reach their late 20's it's pretty brave I only wish I was that secure with my appearance right now.",Knives Out

290,jamesjustice-92,A solid detective story with nothing more to it,7,21 March 2020,"There's a reason why I don't fancy detective stories - they're all using the same old formula: pre-story, crime, search, resolution. Knives Out is no exception to this; although I have to admit that to have us shown who the real murderer is before the movie even hit the middle mark was a bit refreshing, as well as the further unraveling story after that. All-star cast has made it possible for me to enjoy every single minute of this whodunit except for maybe Daniel Craig who was trying a bit too hard at times to imitate the southern accent and his overall performance was in a way just another Hercule Poirot imitation but a fine one to say the least. In short Knives Out is a no time-waster for sure; it's almost exclusively a bottled movie shot within one location, with great soundtrack, solid characters, some witty dialogues, a bit too theatrical and hyperbolized narrative but entertaining and fun to watch nonetheless.",Knives Out
291,rlaine,"Ok entertainment, but expected better",7,6 December 2019,"I'm a fan of ""whodunnit"" genre, really like to work my brain and Clue in all it's craziness is one of my all time favorites. Not to say I don't like the more serious ones, I loved Gosford Park, Name of the Rose etc. This seemed like a great movie to see.Starts out pretty good, fast paced and quirky, the cast is great, but for me the movie fell apart as soon as they showed the murder/death/suicide. It was quite early to the movie and you know at that point that this can't be the whole truth, even tho you've just seen exactly how it happened. After that it's just guessing what lead to it or how they cover up for it.There are tons of clues on the way, a few of them very obvious ones and you kind of know quite early on who actually is to blame, you just aren't sure why. And it's a bit problematic for a whodunnit as the rest of the cast don't really seem very probable murderer. There is basically just one very unlikable character (ok, maybe two, but the other is too small part to be the murderer).But even tho the clues are quite obvious, the path to conclusion is everything but. It was somewhat interesting to watch everything unfold, but a certain key character had such a small part (Fran) that guessing everything seems like a very difficult task.What comes to acting and direction I think most did ok, but what started out as fast paced quirky show, went somewhat flat in the middle. Pace slowed down, Daniel Craig in my opinion delivered quite stale performance after starting out being more interesting. Direction wasn't quirky enough to be a proper comedy after all, only delivering a few good laughs. Most of the time the movie was just a crime drama.Could've used some trimming at over two hours long, I did feel drowsy halfway.Then the political part. Unnecessary in my opinion in a movie like this.I do like the fact that ""good guys win and bad guys loose"". It was a good movie anyway, but not really a masterpiece.",Knives Out

Blanc must sift through lies, mis-truths, and outright deception to discover the truth. The whole family is assembled for the investigation by Blanc to determine who killed Harlan, but most are concerned how much they will get when the WILL is read.This is a loooong movie but it goes by so fast you don't really notice. And get this: when the Lawyer Frank Oz (Alan Stevens) reads the WILL, it is here a whole new story starts and you don' mind one bit because now it really gets interesting. You'll see.I got a kick out of Daniel Craig's Southern Accent. Finally we see some good acting by the one who plays Bond, James Bond, and he did great. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Twist? You want a twist? You got it. There are a couple and no you won't see them coming. No one did. You know how Harlan Thrombey dies, but Det Benoit Blanc needs to figure out all the steps involved, which reminded me of the old Charlie Chan (or Agatha Christi) movies back in the day, but here there is no number 1, or 2 son to rely on/ blame for not recognizing clues. Just a thought.The key to everything is Marta, Harlan's nurse, played by the most beautiful Ana de Armas. You will know what she knows, but there is much more to know that she doesn't know. You'll see. Oh, the one thing about Marta that you will come to know early: when she doesn't tell the truth, she vomits.Notables: Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale, Thrombey's daughter; Don Johnson as Richard, husband of Linda; Michael Shannon as Walt Thronbey, son of Harlan, but who also runs Harlan's publishing company; Chris Evans as Richard's son Ranson who knows he was cut out of the WILL; Toni Collette as Joni daughter of Harlan; LaKeith Stanfeld as Lieutenant Elliott; K. Callan as Greatnana Wanetta, Harlan's mother; M. Emmet Walsh as Mr Proofec, Thrombey's head of Security.This is a very satisfying movie and when it does end, you will wish it didn't. You'll see.

It also deals with a topic that we cannot find in today's films. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, it surprised me, it's not predictable. The downside is that there are too many characters so not everyone can come to the fore.",Knives Out
296,TheVictoriousV,"A little too silly and ""take that, haters"" for me, but not without its highs",5,16 December 2019,"Unless I'm missing something extremely crucial, Rian Johnson is a director who seems to single-handedly confirm that modern critics like to play favorites. The same people who dismiss criticisms of The Last Jedi - at least ones that concern inconsistent rules, inconsistent tone, and inconsistent/unconvincing/lacking characterization - as superficial nitpicks that scoff at underlying themes and risk-taking, will gladly (and correctly) make those complaints about the final season of Game of Thrones. When Disney and Johnson mess up, it's fine.I'm not making any allegations against mainstream critics beyond that, nor shall I read their minds; people often accuse them of (1) being bought and paid for by certain studios, (2) licking the feet of ""Hollywood liberals"" until that does happen, or (3) having a political slant that favors certain filmmakers and messages. That last one may seem similar to the second one, but we forget ""bias"" refers to genuine opinion; not ass-kissery.As I said in ""The NPC Meme and the Irony of Who's Using It"", people like to make it easy for themselves by assuming no dissenting political opinions are genuine, but rather the result of Orwellian indoctrination and/or a desire to gain something from a left-wing establishment. Point is, it could very well be that critics sincerely adore Rian Johnson to a point of going unfairly easy on him.In the murder mystery Knives Out, he cartoonishly inserts his detractors (without even doing them the justice Lady in the Water did those of Shyamalan) and political enemies in a way that this year's Joker is often derided for doing, usually by critics I have observed loving this film (despite Todd Phillips not being this in-your-face and never asserting that evil is, say, a uniquely leftist thing). Again, the selectivity with which modern critics apply their lens really fascinates me, especially when they do it in a way where a movie that's ""more guilty"" of what they're decrying gets away. I'm not telling you which lens to use, mind you, or which standards you personally should want a good product to meet. I just hope all films are truly equal before your judgment.As I see it, Knives Out isn't horrible. Much of it, in fact, is quite good, particularly in the areas of cinematography and art direction. But praising stuff like this and concluding it's an over-all good movie is even more surface-level than that which Johnson's haters are accused of being shallow for doing, namely assessing the writing. To Rian's credit, my main gripes are with the ham-handed references, the occasional goofy-yet-self-serious line, and such subtle character names as Hugh Ransom (Chris Evans). For what it's worth, I nearly saw Black Christmas instead of Knives Out and this is Tarkovskian by comparison.Daniel Craig plays Detective Benoite Blanc, whose hilariously French name evokes Hercule Poirot, more so than his unconvincing Southern drawl. The rest of the cast, many of them prime suspects, consists of Jamie Lee Curtis, Ana de Armas (who, get this, vomits when she tells lies), Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, Don Johnson, Christopher Plummer, Lakeith Stanfield, and Katherine Langford of 13 Reasons Why.These actors, many of them legends, do well enough and work off of each other in entertaining ways (even when they aren't given the most dignified sentences to enunciate). As with the script, the characters show potential. It's a shame all the Star Wars drama compelled dear Rian to damage it by pretentiously owning his haters through the ""alt-right troll kid"" and whatnot.I guess this became more of an article about Rian Johnson and Film Twitter than it was strictly about Knives Out, but although I didn't really like it, both this film and The Last Jedi show that he can create a gorgeous movie that, at least in the case of the latter movie, has interesting themes to communicate. We're not doing him any favors by pretending this is the best he can ever do in terms of script effort.",Knives Out

With other movies that have had a lot of hype, I found that usually I liked them better if I saw them when they first come out versus waiting months and months for rental and countless reviews. I think most of the time unless a movie is a rare unicorn, like Parasite, there's no way it can live up to the expectations. But then again, I also saw Parasite towards the beginning of its release. We tend to really dissect a movie. This movie has a superb cast of Hollywood icons and a fun, whodunnit premise. It was decent but did not wow me! I wasn't overly impressed with the twists in the storyline. I think the story could have and should have been better for this big of a film. My favorites Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis were completely underutilized in this movie. They are both standouts, horror movie queens and strong actors who lead films and franchises. Director Rian Johnson really should have used this to his advantage and given them more than small background parts. Also, why do we feel the need to set off fireworks and throw a parade when a movie is just decent. Isn't that the goal of all movies anyway? To be good and entertaining?! What happened to movies HAVING to be good to be made? Now, if a movie isn't terrible it's shouted from the rooftops as an Oscar shortlist favorite.

It is boring and is one of those subverting expectations movies.. where every 10 minutes a new shock happens. This makes for a disjointed movie but not a good one. You can tell from the cast that the liberal elite wanted to make this a great movie but it is clear no one knows what that is anymore. Rent Clue.,Knives Out
307,Lewis_Heather787,Keeps you guessing !!!,8,30 November 2019,"Wow just wow what a fun film ! Lets just appreciate the fact that a studio took a chance and made a film like this !!! This is exactly the reason why people go to the cinema to watch films, to have an experience like this. This film has everything in it and it can be viewed by anyone of any age, this film is not focused or marketed at any one demographic. Anyone can go to see this film and have a great time ! To the people who doubted Rian Johnson's ability after his last film, we all know what that was, you have definitely been shown to be wrong !Rian Johnson is and has always been a great director whether you like all of his films or not, the man is an incredibly talented director and writer. The film is shot brilliantly but I knew that going in, Johnson knows how to put a film together ! For me the more amazing part is the story and the script................top class from Johnson, such an elaborate story with some many twists and turns all the way up to the very very end of the film!The cast is sensational, just list the names off is quite amazing itself. How one film can have such talent by itself is a testament to Rian Johnson, because all of theses actors clearly read the script and signed on straight away ! I must say that everyone in the film is brilliant Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon and Toni Collette......the list goes on. However there are three performances that are just that little bit better, firstly Ana de Armas. What an interesting role for her to take, for me I think its a little out of left field but she really works well in the role.......her first proper leading role??? Such a likeable character..............you really do want to route for her. Although her character does have a ridiculous complex...... at first it seems stupid but as goes on, actually really works!! Quite central to the plot as well! Next is Daniel Craig, with just the perfect accent for the character. It must have turned heads the first day of shooting this film. He is so good, I hope that after he has finished with the Bond franchise next year we will see more of him in roles and films like this!! I think he is an underrated actor..........Lastly is Chris Evans, now this is a complete surprise. Who knew that he could play a villain so well, I suppose getting so accustom to him playing the good guy in a particular film franchise so long for, sort of stereotypes him. But towards the end of the film he comes into his own and steals the film.........a second viewing is needed for all the little hints.Faults of the film.................There are none!Overall this is a very good film 80% out of 100, Rian Johnson proving all the doubters wrong.........why there were any in the first place is beyond me!! Just such a good time watching it, cant wait to watch it again, definitely one of the highlights of the year. Cast is fantastic but there performances are built upon a brilliant script and story...........that has every genre of film wrapped up in one film.",Knives Out
308,jacksflicks,A funny mystery genre send-off,8,10 February 2020,"In general, when you see 1 star, no need to waste your time reading it because it's saying, ""I'm a moron."" As for the complaints about politics, it's all for laughs. Anybody taking it straight is a moron.Here we have a brilliant ensemble of Christopher Plummer, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon versus Daniel Craig. Anyone from deep South knows his drawl is not at all over-the top. He sounds exactly like guys I've known. Southern happens to be easy for Brits, so Craig gets to play with the Southern Poirot.Each of the family is a piece of work, and the interplay is hilarious to watch. My only demerits are for Jamie Lee's part. Her character it too delicious not to have been developed more. Also, the kid was like an update of Eddie Munster, who also deserved more than the bit part he was assigned. And the ending had a hilarious part and a gimmicky part.But none of these spoiled an overdue return to good old-fashioned movie-making for neglected adults. By old fashioned I mean, with great actors doing their stuff, interesting plot and a creaky old house. And NO CGI, no explicit sex, but lots of wit and farce to make up for it.By the way, after watching I remarked to my partner that the Johnson, Curtis, Shannon threesome would make a great franchise. Well, I've read talk of a sequel/series.",Knives Out
309,heisenberg12,More than just a murder mystery- it's a very funny and riot of a movie,8,9 January 2020,"This movie had me laughing out loud at numerous spots, and sometimes it was the little things you just catch. To call this a ""murder mystery"" would be deceiving imo because it was more like a comedy or a spoof. I haven't laughed so loud watching a movie in a while like I did with this. From the cracked cell phone to the political arguments, to the car chase (lmao) to the knife attack at the end (which I did see coming since I was accustomed to the vibe and humor by that point), I loved the humor.I also drew many abstractions from Breaking Bad, which Johnson played a pretty big role in directing some of the most famous episodes. That was a nice treat to see the homages.All the actors were great, but especially Craig, who really impressed me here since I'm not the biggest fan of his. But in this, I felt like he really embraced the comedy, humor, and eccentric role perfectly, showing range. The other actors and actresses all played their smaller parts well too, especially the one family member with the cane.8/10",Knives Out
310,dussaultjulien,"7 out of 10 for originality, but still just a little bit disappointing",7,28 November 2019,"With Ryan Johnson being the person that he is, meaning his Persona and how he acts on Twitter especially after the failure the launch of The Last Jedi oh, I wasn't really expecting much from the guy who wrote and directed The lacklustre Looper with Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but honestly I was surprised.The writing for this film is spot-on, very Agatha Christie murder on the Orient Express styled writing, with Daniel Craig being Poriot, and we even get some hints at Murder She Wrote in the film. I can honestly say that for the majority of the movie the writing was fantastic, there were some places during the middle of the film that were kind of like waiting in really high water, but eventually you do get out and it ends up being a great and memorable movie.If Rian Johnson keeps up like this, I'll become a fan again. 7 out of 10 for the originality, but honestly the pacing of the writing of the film could have been a lot better.I don't understand how this guy can write like this, something intriguing, well written and well-thought-out and stand by this, but not admit that the casino bright scene in Star Wars Last Jedi as well as the character of Rose Tico were completely unnecessary, stupid and a bad writing choice and idea in the first place.",Knives Out

Daniel Craig was especially fantastic here. -Bond. KFC BondAnyways, story. It's... OK. If you're a fan of the ""Who done it"" genre of movie like me then you will be constantly trying to piece together the 'who, what, where, how, why, Bruce Campbell' of these films and you'll come up with many, MANY theories of your own.Side note: I actually guessed a good portion of it right. Anyways.
The actual answer and the end was... in all honesty, a hit of a let dow. It wasn't a twist. It wasn't a surprise. It was LITERALLY the most obvious answer that you will most likely devise ""well it can't be that because this is a mystery film, not a HEY LOOK AT THIS SUSPICIOUS OBVIOUS KILLER"" Film.
Gotta admit. It was antichlimactic at that point.Loved the experience up until that point but why sell a film as a mystery if you're going to go with the most obvious answer and even make the reasoning sort of pointless.Oh and why would a nurse not immediately think of a toxicology report until somebody blackmail's here with it?? That was a little annoying.(Psssst, he could have avoided the whole ""murder thing"" by just ""schmoozing"" up to Marta and not commit any crimes)So yeah, enjoyed it, but was utterly pointless at its most basic core.

315,Jared_Andrews,Pure Entertainment,8,16 December 2019,"2019 has blessed movie fans with an impressively strong finish to the year in film. Among the excellent movies released in the past few months, ""Knives Out"" is perhaps the most purely entertaining. The star-studded cast pairing with a virtuoso director of consistently compelling movies served as powerful ingredients in the recipe for an entertaining movie, and the dish was prepared to perfection.Despite what a few angry Star Wars fanboys will tell you about Rian Johnson and his sacrilegious creation, ""The Last Jedi"" Johnson is one of the better writer/directors in Hollywood. In my humble opinion, Johnson's Star Wars movie is perhaps the best in the saga.Nevertheless, Johnson's latest romp should please all audiences. This film boasts one of the most impressive casts in recent memory, each member of which plays against type in a delightfully over-the-top fashion. Leading the pack is Daniel Craig (James Bond himself) playing a brilliant investigator named Benoit Blanc and flashing the same accent he would if he became the new KFC Colonel in the latest commercial. Yes, his southern drawl is comically exaggerated, but that is completely intentional. Many the best lines in the movie come with an implied wink at the camera, letting us know that everyone is in on the joke. Even Chris Evans (the beloved Captain America and the perhaps more beloved Twitter voice of good) plays a loathsome spoiled child of an entitled upbringing, who ruthlessly insults his family and hates dogs. I'll let you decide which of those traits is worse.As a whodunnit, the movie is effective in ways you might not see coming and in plenty of ways you will. Even though the events leading to the death are revealed 40 minutes into the movie, Johnson manages to subvert expectations and remain steps ahead of viewers until the very end. I dare you to guess every twist and solve the puzzle before Blanc. The character often looks to be underwhelming as a detective, but that is also intentional. He eventually reveals himself to be multiple steps ahead the entire time.Raw humor, suspense, and caustic social commentary combine to elicit one of the best screenplays of the year, one that deserves serious Oscar consideration. When the dust settles and mystery has been solved, the end result is a charming and satisfying mystery/comedy. We all deserve more movies like this, and we can thank Johnson for giving us one.",Knives Out

318,lyubitelfilmov,"Twist, twist, I want to confuse! or hilarious American detective with English charm",8,1 July 2020,"Detective, comedy, thriller. The film was directed by Ryan Johnson, who shot a mega shelter called Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but also made a script here. Well, to begin with, I was not going to look at this picture at all, but the circumstances turned in such an unexpected way that I had to remember it and look in good company - and it was really hilarious and cool! I really regretted that at one time I did not go to this picture in the cinema, since my impressions would be definitely stronger. And here is my brief opinion - a hilarious American detective with English charm. I admit honestly that when I watched I tried to notice not only the pros, but also the minuses, and if everything was too obvious with the first ones, then a small flip came out with the second. Except for a few technical and scenario points, as such, there are no minuses from the word at all. It may be a matter of my general impression, it may be a matter of my carelessness, but it is. Therefore, I will dwell in more detail on the advantages of this detective, which sincerely pleased your humble servant!
So here they are:
1. A detective story - the plot is simple - in a large country house, after a noisy party, the patriarch of the family was found dead. All the signs indicate suicide, but the arriving detectives begin to suspect something was wrong when they get to know the relatives of the deceased better, they behave suspiciously. Envy, money hunting, political games, intrigues reign in the family. A first-class private detective intervenes in the matter, having a reputation as a person who always ""gets to the bottom of the truth."" Suicide or not? The circle of suspects is pretty obvious, motives? Inheritance, intrigue, personal dislike? When our company watched this picture, it was interesting to speculate, pay attention to small details, and feel the atmosphere. We'll talk about the final below, but the investigation itself, the disclosure of the characters is at a high level. The picture really holds in suspense, forcing the viewer to move gyrus. If you are a fan of detective stories and want to see something fresh from this genre - this picture is definitely for you!
2. Entourage - as for the environment, the situation, the general mood - everything is at the highest level. It turned out a kind of Agatha Christie in modern times, with her gadgets, achievements, actual problems, but with the classic and eternal problems of the relationship of fathers and children. In terms of surroundings, this picture strongly resembles the ""Murder in the Orient Express"" of 2017. The house itself looks modern, but from it it stretches from the nineteenth century. Furnishings, costumes, decorations - lovers of aesthetics will definitely like the picture!
3. Humor is a comedy, this is the second genre of this picture, and it is felt and seen from the very beginning. At first, I even thought that it would be a whole comedy with a fax at the end, something like a ""dog's sleep,"" especially since there were a lot of hints in this direction - no. Humor here dilutes the tense detective when we, together with a private investigator, try to find out the truth - and it works great here!
4. Music - I cannot but note atmospheric music, which perfectly conveys the mood and the very spirit of this picture. This, again, is a mixture of the classic detective and modernity, with its tunes and rhythms. Although in isolation from the picture, music loses all its charm. But I will praise the composer (Nathan Johnson).
5. Final - the picture plays ""cat and mouse"" with the viewer, trying to confuse the latter, throwing in and focusing on seemingly insignificant things and events, leading the viewer on the wrong track and making the final for him truly unexpected . I will say this, my version was confirmed, though I did not expect that the killer and motive would turn out that way ... oh sorry, but I won't tell you that. Indeed, the charm of detectives is that the viewer would participate in the investigation process. I went this way - and got the result. And what will be your path? Only you will know the answer! See for yourself and get your portion of pleasure!
A little about the main characters:
1. Harlan Tromby, performed by Christopher Plummer, is the patriarch of the large Tromby family, holding all the capital in his hands. An eccentric old man who, with his antics, will make you laugh, be surprised, and maybe even think about some issues. The charismatic Christopher magnificently embodied the image of an eccentric old man on the big screen, and his costumes - in general, will fly away and have an excellent style. Bravo Christopher!
2. Benoit Blanca performed by Daniel Craig is a first-class private detective who has been paid so much that now he is simply obliged to open this case and bring the villain into clean water. Restrained, damn smart, a good psychologist and a real gentleman, always dressed with a needle. What can I say, I don't like James Bond, especially in the performance of Craig, but here I was even curious how ""Mr. Brutality 2006"" to cope with such a role where you need to think more and not break limbs to all adversaries. And what is the result? But he did it. It was praise, Daniel, but don't relax, you are still on my list of hate, keep trying, then you will be a good boy and a good nyasha!
I will not represent the rest of the heroes, so as not to spoil your impression and pleasure.
Judging by the fees and news, we are waiting for the continuation. Well, if about Mr. Blanc's new business, then he'll do it, because the main story is over. Will I wait for him? Sure. Very interested!
As a result, we have a hilarious detective with excellent surroundings, an exciting story with sharp turns, excellent atmospheric music and excellent acting!",Knives Out

It's an old-fashioned Agatha Christie type thing and pretty cornball and some of it preposterous. It's too long, it doesn't offer anything creative or original, it's certainly not suspenseful and I suppose it's supposed to be fun, but I found it tedious and fell asleep causing me to go back to the last thing I remembered the next day. The gimmick about the vomiting woman is simply stupid. I seem to be in disagreement with the majority in every way with this. The only cast member I found to be ""fun"" was Craig giving a somewhat flamboyant performance with a somewhat silly southern accent. He seemed to be having a good time doing something lighter and it showed. To be honest, this just might not be my kind of film. I didn't like original Murder On the Orient Express all that much and had no desire to see the remake.

Every single time I thought that the story had nothing left to offer and it seems like I got it all figured out, the plot would through a new curved ball again and again until it simply dumped the entire basket over my head in an exciting finale. The entite 2 hours I kept coming up with new theories and conspiracies as I was absorbed in the experience of mystery, humor and the performance of the actors. After that experience ended, I began to think about what I just watched and thats where everything changed.Knives Out is a whodunnit film so naturally, while I was driving home, I put on my detective hat and began inspecting the clues, details and plot elements. The film manages to skillfully distract the audience from its faults during crucial elements by turning up the comedy factor and speeding up the pace. As a result, you wont even notice the mistakes until the end when you are able to think clearly.What really takes away from all the suspense, mystery and the essence of the film is the political aspect of this film. Instead of being a gritty Agatha Christie styled investigation film, it feels like a Cinderella fairy tale with quirkycharacters. Sometimes, a movie needs to have only one theme. All that being said, I still recommend Knives Out as it is upbeat, funny and most importantly intriguing all the way until the credits. A good comedy to watch with friends or family.",Knives Out

I guess maybe I'll check it out again in the winter, if it's still around. I'm reminded of that Woody Allen movie that took on the British house party genre (Magic in the Moonlight) - another one that I just couldn't stick with. OTOH, Robert Altman did it so well with Gosford Park.
Christopher Plummer is wonderful, of course. I quite liked Don Johnson in this. Michael Shannon was interesting as always. This movie has such a great cast, but I feel like they were squandered. This form of mystery, even if it's just that the director is taking the form and deconstructing it in order to build something else, deserves more. It wasn't funny on its own, not funny as its type of film. Sucks as social commentary. I'm usually griping about reviewers giving good movies really low scores. This time it's because I don't understand the really high scores. Sucks for me, sucks in general ;>",Knives Out

'Knives Out' has some fine humor in it and leaved a smile on my face at the end. I like the style that tells the story very clear and hides the turns perfectly. There is also some fun in it - the whole cinema laughed strongly at some points. The cast is wonderful. Only near the end there was a scene, which was a little awkward, so I set my rating one star lower. But all in all it's a very good movie and we were well entertained by a worthy movie.",Knives Out

346,mrpicky,hats off,9,9 February 2020,Unique and brilliant take on who done it genre. and not because of many twists but because its layered ironic and brilliant work of art. movie that is extremely well written and at the same time has fun with genre itself. My one beef is casting Ana de Armas. she is not very good.,Knives Out
347,gcsman,"See this for the amazing cast, especially Christopher Plummer",8,18 December 2019,"First off, the cast --- wow. Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Katherine Langford, and that absolute treasure of screen and stage Christopher Plummer. In a single movie of normal run time it's impossible to give all these accomplished actors enough individual screen time, but every one of them plays their part to virtual perfection as various members of a dysfunctional (but rich) family under the thumb of patriach Harlan Thrombey (Plummer). His apparent murder sets off a chain of infighting and personal back-and-forth among his children, grandchildren, and their spouses that has the feel of just one more round of backbiting that they have carried on their whole lives.Everybody is excellent, but even in this cast Plummer stands out even though most of his appearances (as flashbacks) are restricted to the first half. He can dominate a scene just by being in it, and his delivery of lines is so effortless and commanding at a level that none of the others can quite reach. He's now age 90, so personally I'm saddened that we're likely not to see too much more of him. Enjoy.The two major parts are de Armas, Harlan's live-in nurse (and the only genuinely likeable person in the cast, so we have no trouble rooting for her), and Craig, as the detective aiming to solve the case. A lot of the superficial look-and-feel of the story is supposed to resemble an Agatha Christie mystery, obviously, and the script has a meta touch in that old Thrombey has made his fortune as a mystery writer. But it very quickly veers off into eccentric directions that make this whole thing quite distinctive. There are loads of details that make for a constant thread of understated humor: e.g. the detective is ""Benoit Blanc"", an obvious callback to Hercule Poirot, but he has a thick southern-US accent that verges on parody. No one quite knows why he's there in the first place, he seems to be rather a bumbling fool, but this is something of a disguise too ... no spoilers! All the action takes place in a classic crumbling mansion complete with secret passages, side stairs, escape ladders -- and there's a sunroom with a throne-like chair surrounded by knives that resembles the Game of Thrones throne, and even has a key part to play at the end. And of course there's creepy Great-Nana Wanetta (K Callan) who sits by a stairway window all day (and maybe night, we can never tell) and says nothing (""How old is she??"" ""Nobody really knows."") Without giving anything away I'll just say that things wind up pretty much the way they rightfully should.Knives Out is thoroughly fun and a great addition to the mystery movie genre.",Knives Out
348,ilovesaturdays,Quirky!,9,1 December 2020,"I loved this movie from start to finish! It is a clever little film that doesn't use gimmicks to get its point across & what's more, it is so clean that it can be enjoyed with the whole family! The mystery angle is all worked out quiet well. The vomiting response to lying is possibly the only weak link, but I guess when you go for a mystery & comedy movie you have to suspend your disbelief for a while. Fortunately, I found that in the case of this movie, it wasn't such a hardship.The cast are all fabulous. Kudos to Daniel Craig for playing the role of an annoying yet interesting sleuth. All through the movie, I oscillated between liking him to hating him for his pomposity! That's the beauty of this character; there are quite a few different shades; wisdom, stupidity, pomposity, insightfulness & decency.",Knives Out
349,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,A modern twist on the classic cozy mystery of the Golden Age era.,8,7 January 2020,"""Knives Out"" is a film that can be categorized as a classic whodunit murder mystery, in the vein of the popular novels of the infamous Golden Age of Detective Fiction era in the 1920s and 1930s, but there are plenty of twists regarding the genre's well-known and overused tropes that give a kind of postmodern character in the production. The movie features a stellar cast with Daniel Craig as the detective protagonist and Ana De Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Michael Shannon and others in the supporting roles. The director. Rian Johnson ( Looper, Star Wars: Episode VIII ), creates a proper cozy mystery atmosphere while at the same time playing with the audience's expectations by twisting the already known rules and primary tropes of the genre's films.The premise of the story is reminiscent of an Agatha Christie novel: An elderly patriarch, Harlan Thrombey (C. Plummer), a renowned crime fiction author, is found dead in his room by his maid. His throat is slit and the police investigators initially dismiss the case as a suicide. The night before, Harlan held a party in his mansion where the members of his wider family were invited. In the first few minutes of the movie's runtime, we watch one by one of Harlan's children being interrogated by two police officers and a mysterious private investigator, Benoit Blanc (D. Craig). Blanc suspects foul play in Harlan's death and he immediately detects the lies he is told by all the witnesses/suspects who seem to hold each one a motive for wanting their father dead. Until now, we are witnessing the classic build-up of a whodunit murder mystery story where every character becomes a suspect in the eyes of the viewer. But after the first 25-30 minutes, the truth about what happened to Harlan is revealed to the audience. Thus, the director overturns the genre's usual timeline which dictates that the truth regarding the murder is divulged only in the finale of the film, constituting its climax.Nevertheless, the story doesn't lose its excitement and intrigue as we now watch as the guilty party is trying to sabotage Blanc's investigation by various means in order to shift any possible suspicion from him/her. I don't want to write anything more about the story as it would ruin a remarkable viewing experience. The film's plot is solid and unravels in an even tempo with each shot having its own importance and place on the overall puzzle. The acting by every member of the cast is impressive and especially Jamie Lee Curtis after a long time delivers a memorable as well as hilarious performance as Harlan's daughter, Linda. Craig is doing an equally splendid job in the role of the brilliant, mercurial private eye who shares some common characteristics with some of the genre's most beloved protagonists-detectives of the classical era.The element that makes ""Knives Out"" a worth-remembering picture is its great sense of humor which is expressed mainly by the quirky characters on-screen and the truly exceptional dialogue. I can't remember a single whodunit title from the past that featured such great interaction sequences between the characters. It should be mentioned that Rian Johnson is also the screenwriter of the film and he proves that his talent extends much further than directing. This is a movie for all, as I doubt that there will be many who will dislike ""Knives Out"" . It can be recommended to families too, as there is a total absence of gory images and/or profanity.",Knives Out
350,MovieBuff11732,One Of The Best Murder Mysteries Ever!,9,9 December 2019,"Knives Out is about the dad of the family committing suicide or what they say. Someone hires a detective to investigate the the murder when there is a bunch of fishy things going on.Knives Out is one of the best films of the year. I knew it was going to be good, but not this good. They did something I haven't seen in a murder mystery before. I won't say because it will get into spoiler territory. I just thought it was really cool and surprised me. The acting was something you had to mention. Chris Evans had the best performance in my mind. He was funny and also really serious when he needed to be. You haven't really seen him play a character like this since Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. Daniel Craig was pretty solid. It did take me a little while to get used to Daniel Craig's weird accent, but I did. I wouldn't really say it made his character any better. I thought he could have been talking normal and the movie would have been the same. Ana De Armas was pretty good in this film too. She was the main character easily. I think a thing nobody is really talking about is how well the cinematography was. They had some pretty impressive zooms. Like I talked a little bit about earlier was how well the story was. The only thing I didn't like was in the middle act it started to drag a little. It is a really hard thing to make the middle act interesting and keep the same pace as the start of the movie. I really praise a movie when they do that. This movie didn't do it was well as others. Now the third and final act was a masterpiece. I really have to say, it was riveting and intense while also pretty darn interesting. It explained everything for the whole movie. The start of the movie was pretty solid too. It didn't really start as I thought it would, but it still started out with a bang.Overall, Knives Out was a great film that definitely reunited the murder mystery genre after the film Murder Mystery and the remake of Murder On The Orient Express. I would definitely recommend it.",Knives Out

355,bastille-852-731547,Sometimes-fun but uneven murder mystery,6,30 November 2019,"This homage to Agatha Christie is Rian Johnson's first film since ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (the only other one of his films I have seen, which I thought was alright but not great.) I love Agatha Christie as well as the cast of this film, and was looking forward to an entertaining and darkly hilarious homage to classic murder mysteries. While the film has some laughs and moments of sharp writing that make it a somewhat entertaining diversion, it unfortunately feels less than the sum of its parts.The initial setup is simple: a popular and acclaimed crime novelist is found dead, with a slit throat, right after celebrating his 85th birthday in his mansion. From there, anyone related to him could possibly be a suspect. The film's first act is really strong, with great production design of the Thrombley family mansion, a good score and clever use of musical cues, sufficient character development, and some snappy and well-paced writing. After that, though, things start to get rather uneven and anti-climactic. The acting is generally good, although none of the characters get much of a range. While there are pockets here and there of good dialogue, the film's numerous attempts at political and social satire feel very hollow and forced. There are a few recurring juvenile gags that get annoying after a while as well. Parts of the film are quite entertaining for sure, but overall I'm not certain how well it holds up in its entirety or whether it really lives up to the rave reviews it has received. 6/10",Knives Out

358,eelen-seth,A hoot of a film!,8,26 November 2019,"Rian Johnson's ('Star Wars: The Last Jedi') ensemble juggernaut 'Knives Out' is a cutting edge whodunnit with lots of witty one-liners and twists, an underlying political sneer at modern America, and first-rate actors that will both shock and surprise you.As soon as the classical music kicks in with the murder scene draped in fog, you know this is going to be a unique watch for 2019 audiences. What seems to have been a suicide, suddenly becomes a murder investigation on the death of renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), as more and more testimonies don't line up, and private detective Blanc (Daniel Craig) and Lieutenant Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) suspect foul play. A classic murder mystery turns into a contemporary case of Cluedo that keeps the twists coming, even when it seems like the main secret has been revealed in the first act. When more skeletons seem hidden within Thrombey's manor and his dysfunctional family, that's when the fun really begins.Johnson most recently directed the hated-by-a-huge-percentage-of-fanboys 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (which I personally adore!), but isn't holding back on his writing skills. As a matter of fact, it seems like he's even louder than ever and that truly pays off. His construction and build up of tension and suspense is astounding. Most of 'Knives Out' takes place in the enormous mansion, which by the way has some of the craziest production design I've seen all year, yet Johnson takes the story far beyond the mansion on a few occasions to bump into the clues the main suspect has been trying to hide from everyone involved.The cast is stupendously incredible. Rambling up such a mix of well known talents with exciting new faces, is a genius combo. Front and centre stands Cuban actress Ana de Armas ('Blade Runner 2049'), as Mr. Harlan Thrombey's caretaker. Showcasing a range of emotions throughout the film, she's certainly the strongest of the cast and an exciting talent that will most definitely have people talking. The caring and emotional Marta Cabrera, is a unique character I haven't seen in a film of this calibre for a while. Her innocent persona evolves through all stages of grief, showing she has a heart while most of the late Mr. Thrombey's family members are vultures with no shame. Johnson has proven many times before how to flesh out his characters, and has done it again.Daniel Craig ('Spectre') and Toni Collette ('Hereditary') surprise as on screen comic relief. It's refreshing to see Craig, who's best known for James Bond, take a different route in his career to prove he's not a one-trick pony. Collette, who at one point channels her Hereditary dinner rant, is a camp riot as daughter-in-law Joni. Everyone is great in their own part, just Jaeden Martell ('It') felt more like a minor plot device and has no place in the whole of the story.'Knives Out' is a hoot of a film! Cuts right into the action and slices through two hours of giggles, shocks and spins. This might not be for everyone, Johnson has quite the outspoken opinion on racism, political standpoints and what's right and wrong, and might challenge those who don't agree with a more evolved point of view on humanity. The film is most of all engaging, and Johnson is just the right guy to make one the most entertaining films of the year.Originally published on into:screens",Knives Out

Because of that Knives Out was one of my most anticipated movies of 2019 and more than that there was never a moment of doubt during the build up to seeing this film where I thought it would disappoint me. As I'd hoped this movie lived up to my expectations as well subverting them in all the right ways.Like the classic murder mystery's that inspired it, Knives Out has an incredible cast without a single weak link within it. Daniel Craig gives a Performance like he never has before and loved what he did here. I got used to the accent he used and loved the eccentricity he brought. Ana De Armas has really come Into her own over the last few years and this is the best I've ever seen her, she's a star in the making and this film just proves it even more. Chris Evans, Jaime Lee Curtis And Michael Shannon all give performances against their usual type and loved all of them here, as despicable as their characters were they were still so engaging to watch thanks to the writing and their performances.Despite the cast, Rian Johnson is the real star of this film. His blend of drama and humour worked perfectly. Despite the amount of brilliant comedy it never took away from the mystery aspects or the tension. His writing was subversive of the usual ways in which we expect a mystery to be portrayed and left me wondering where exactly the movie was going in the best possible way. This really keeps the movie original and fresh which definitely made for a unique experience of watching this movie for the first time. My only issue with his script was the overload of exposition, there obviously has to be a lot in a complex mystery like this but the expository scenes feel overlong and drawn out at many points.Knives Out is endlessly rewarding, intelligently written and so much fun as a movie. While Rian Johnson may be the true star, the entire cast is incredible with many of them giving performances against their usual type and succeed at it wonderfully. It's full of humour while still maintaining a great deal of character and tension. I can't waiting to see what Johnson does next whether it's another entry in this world or something else that is completely original.9.5/10 - A (Phenomenal)",Knives Out

I was at the edge of my seat from start to finish. Although, I enjoyed the movie, I was not particularly fond of the ending where Ransom gets arrested and Marta keeps Harlan's inheritance. To put it plainly, I completely despised Marta. She was an evil, manipulative,annoying and just a horrible person in general. The ending showcased Marta standing on the terrace and sipping coffee and glancing at the Thrombey family. The family always treated Marta with respect and kindness and this is how she repays them. She does not have the decency to support the family like they supported her all those years. This is disgraceful. It abandons the whole notion of how family is the most important thing. I understand that Harlan wanted to give his inheritance to Marta, but he should have given something to his family. He knows them longer than Marta. Marta should have been arrested, even though she technically did not do anything. The humor inside the movie was at times contrived and not funny at all. For instance, the scene where Ransom tries to kill Marta with a knife wasn't funny at all. It made me hate the Marta character even more.The movie had numerous twists and turns that were unexpected and shocking. From the beginning to the end of the movie, my mind was blown. I did not expect the reveal that Ransom was the one who hired the private investigator. At times, the movie was quite convoluted and confusing for me.

Imagine a French (or perhaps, Flemish) accent, a monocle, a lazy eye, a large gut, a handlebar mustache, jet-black and slicked-back hair under a hairnet, a double limp, two humps, and some pocket watches which are never accurate unless you want to know what time it is in Flanders.It was a very good choice to have Chris Evans wear civilian clothes, however.",Knives Out

The set design and music are also very well done, fitting the film perfectly. Even though this is a murder mystery, I wouldn't call this a whodunit? But rather howdunit? Because Rian Johnson doesn't try to conceal the killer. He cares more about the writing and the character dynamics compared to the whodunit? Which I think gives this film an infinite rewatchability value. It is fast-paced and the howdunit? Element of the film includes nice twists as well, making the film still a mystery. I loved Ana de Armas's character's goofiness and how sometimes we know more than the characters(and even the detective) which is extremely rare in mysteries. My only tiny problem with the film is that other side characters could have been developed more(not all of them per see, but having 1-2 more interesting and complex characters would have added more meat to the film).

375,theredsky,Knives Out Review,10,13 December 2019,"If I were to briefly describe Knives Out, then it would be constantly engaging and entertaining. If you were not a big fan of The Last Jedi then I urge you to check this film out and see that Rian Johnson is a more capable director when he is working on his own. It's a film with issues that are minor and were the only issues I had with the film. The film does have some political subtext to it which I liked but there were some areas where it was a little on the nose. It didn't take me out of the movie but I wished it had been handled a little better. This movie has a bunch of A-list actors and they all bring their A-game. Every performance in this movie is pretty great but Daniel Craig, Chirs Evans, and Ana de Armas steal every scene they are in. It can be a little hard to get used to Craig's heavy southern drawl at first but you eventually get used to it. Chris Evans is a nice counterweight to everyone's craziness. I felt he was one of the funniest characters in the movie except for one joke. Ana de Armas is a great protagonist to follow throughout the film along with Daniel Craig. All 3 of them disappear into their roles and portray their characters almost perfectly. It's a great redemption film for Chris Evans from Red Sea Diving Resort. The script is pretty great. There are tons of clues hidden beneath each line of dialogue and it all feels very natural. This allows for Johnson's comedic writing to shine. He is able to cleverly insert jokes that most of the time are pretty hilarious. The reason the comedy didn't work that well in The Last Jedi for me was that it felt forced and didn't always align well with the tone but the comedy shines here because it fits the film's tone perfectly. While not every joke is hilarious, a majority of them are. The jokes that go along with certain characters fit their character pretty well. Some of the funniest lines in the movie are delivered by Michael Shannon and Daniel Craig because the jokes they tell perfectly fit their characters. The story is fairly simple but Rian Johnson throws a lot of simple twists throughout that makes it feels unique. The film decides to reveal what actually happened to the victim halfway through the film and it turns into a cover up which then progresses to a pretty major twist that I never saw coming but felt necessary and made sense to the narrative. The music was also pretty good. It added tension and was interesting to listen to while the events unfolded. Overall, Knives Out is a great murder mystery with great performances, a great script, hilarious jokes, and some interesting twists.",Knives Out
376,novux,Uncommonly great,10,8 May 2021,"A great film of mystery and comedy genre that I loved as you all have no idea. In my opinion, it is a fresh film of the genre that keeps you excited all the time of it, you really feel like you are in the typical board game ""Clue"", and I can already tell you that it has a 10 out of 10 finale.So if you feel like getting detective and antique vibes, then check out this story in which, after the death of a renowned mystery writer, his entire family is on the suspect list.

Crisp direction is one of the USP of the movie as Mystery unfolds with past events embedded perfectly during the story telling. Ensemble cast supported the events well. Daniel Craig once again proved his versatility as Detective Benoit Blanc alongside with Chris Evans looking as Dashing as before and that too without his shield.

I absolutely adored this film, it was fantastic!
Possibly even my personal favourite film of last year, even though I don't think it's the best.
The cast is probably the best part of the film, Craig and Evans in particular are very good but I also really liked Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette and of course Christopher Plummer although I would say that Jaeden Martell diserved a bigger roll, he was pretty good on 2017's It.
The story is incredibly interesting with great twists however I was sadly spoiled by a tumbnail of a Youtube video so I already knew the ending ):
Finnaly I also really liked the set design, as Detective Elliot puts it: ""The guy basically lives in a Cluedo board"".

Murder of a rich and famous murder mystery books writer Harlan Thrombey(very pleasant Christopher Plummer )in his own room on his birthday is investigated by Benoit Blanc(superb Daniel Craig from skywalk and many fun movies). Whole family involves daughter Linda Drysdale 'daddy's girl'( Jamie lee Curtis from Halloween movies), her husband Richard(Don Johnson from Miami vice )&their good for nothing /parasite son Ransom(adorable Chris Evans from movie Cellular), Harlan's son Walt(strange role for Michael Shannon ), Walt's wife Donna(riki Lindhome from big bang theory) , strangely quiet grandson Arden and Harlan's daughter in law Joni (Toni Collette)&grand daughter Meg. And then there is 84yr old Harlan's mother Greatnana Wanetta who sits and watches the whole family and says only what is significantly important. Harlan's caregiver Marta Cabrera(excellent emotional display by Ana de Armas) presence adds a lot of humor to family conversation and also shows how little one knows about geography of South America... countries Brazil/Paraguay/Ecuador are mentioned by family members when they are talking about dad's help. Script is great .

The story is fairly typical, there is a shocking death, everyone has their motives, and piece by piece the truth is pulled together by a sleuth, in this case Benoit Blanc (great name), who comes across as a more modern version of Hercule Poirot.To discuss the story, is to give away the twists and turns it takes, which are delightful. Tension is maintained really well throughout the film as you constantly try to guess and workout where this mystery is going, and even right at the end the twist that comes doesn't do anything to release that tension until literally the last 1min of the movie.The real joy though is in an all star A-list cast all performing at the top of their game, and working so well together. In many cases playing against type which is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of murder mystery, then this is a much watch!",Knives Out

The rest of the cast, although big stars, were incredibly unlikable and it made it hard to care about anyone in the film except the puking Ana De Armas and Christoper Plummer, who is always awesome.

And cutting ones throat? Really?Who meets up with a known killer with a lot to lose in a private, remote location indoors??? If we've learned anything from a hundred years of movies and tv shows, it's that you always meet an adversary in a public place with a lot of people around. She may just be a housekeeper, but nobody is that dumb.Also, how are we to believe a private nurse who's given the same injections to the same patient in the same room probably hundreds of times would suddenly, accidentally mix up her vials?",Knives Out
388,joshbarton15,Magnifique.,10,28 November 2019,"The murder mystery isn't really a genre that has seen much exposure in Hollywood over recent years, studios more intent on setting up more profitable cinematic universes. Step up Rian Johnson with Knives Out, a classic whodunnit that brings us cinema's next great dysfunctional family.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy novelist, is found dead in his study, private eye Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to investigate his death, leading to clashes with the eccentric members of Harlan's combative family.With Knives Out, Rian Johnson has woven a tapestry of delightful twists and turns to keep the audience on their toes and guessing right until the end, littered with memorable dialogue and enough family feuding to last a lifetime ensuring the path to the truth is an extremely entertaining one. It's also one of the funniest films of the year, Johnson lacing the film with intricacies that can be easy to miss but play a major part in siding against such a despicable family. The attention to detail from Johnson in his narrative is nothing short of stunning.The Thrombey family would be nothing without such a high calibre ensemble bringing each and everyone of them to life with such verve and class. Daniel Craig is the star of the show with an exquisite performance as the eccentric private eye Blanc, Craig having a ball with the southern drawl and nailing the comedic beats to a tee. Ana de Armas gives her best performance to date as Marta, Harlan's nurse, the innocence and vulnerability shining through her incredibly emotive features.There isn't one member of the ensemble who feels out of place, the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette bringing the sweetness as well as the viciousness when required. Chris Evans looks to be having an absolute blast playing a Tony Stark type character after playing the boy scout for so long in the MCU, his line deliveries having me in stitches at times. The great thing about Knives Out is that I have my favourites from an initial viewing however, the characters are all so good that my favourites could change every time I revisit it.Knives Out is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had all year, Rian Johnson serving up a real treat of a whodunnit for audiences around the world.

414,mbhgkmsgg,Knives Out,9,20 December 2020,"Knives Out is the epitome of murder mystery films. It captures the feeling of the likes of Agatha Christie perfectly and even makes itself feel much older than it is to suit the mood. These types of films are easily bound to make a misstep somewhere along the way and ruin the suspense. However, should they avoid that, they tend to be excellent. And Knives Out is the perfect example of a film that avoided all missteps.Any film that goes for a plot that introduces a seemingly simple murder and then ultimately reveals how it all played out in a grand finale, relies on suspense and uncertainty. If it fails to achieve either of those things, the film will eventually fall flat. As such, there were moments in Knives Out that had me worried. The second act, which is the slowest, felt at times too easy and too obvious. What seems to be a clear indication of the identity of the murderer is given quite early, and the film turns into a game of cat and mouse. Can the detective catch that person, or can she get away? While that isn't as exciting as the usual game of guessing who did it, I didn't mind it too much since the film was very well made otherwise. However, what I didn't realize was that the film had thrown me for a loop. The way it presented its case, the way it made me believe the proposed identity of the murder was so convincing that I genuinely thought that I knew where the film was headed. As a result, I was a little bummed out because Knives Out started so great and seemed to have such high potential. I should have, of course, known that the reveal at the end would be anything but simple. Did I predict who the actual murderer was? No. Did I figure out how it was done? Most certainly not. Even though I hoped, and even suspected a little bit, that everything wouldn't be as simple as it seemed, I could've never in a million years predicted the ending. It truly was the perfect example of how to do a 'whodunnit' correctly.The story follows the Thrombey family in the aftermath of what seems to be a suicide of the family's oldest living member and the guardian of its wealth. However, someone has hired a detective to investigate the death on the suspicion that there is more to it than meets the eye. As Blanc, the detective, starts to dig deeper and deeper into the events of the fateful night, a web of lies starts to emerge. Everyone is a potential culprit, and Blanc must weave his way through the web to find the one who actually did it.
The story, which ends up being much more complicated than it seems, is full of twists and turns. The characters are excellent and make it near impossible to figure out who the true culprit is. They all have their own ulterior motives, and none of them can be ruled out. Indeed, early on, I had no clue who did it, and once the first revelation came about the events of the fateful night, I could hardly believe my eyes. But, that was only the first revelation. And the one that comes at the end is even more mindboggling.In retrospect, I absolutely loved how Knives Out tricked me. There is a pivotal moment where I, as the viewer, learn one version of the events. After that moment, the film completely changes style and pace. It slows done and turns more into a thriller of sorts rather than a murder mystery. And it was that moment that I foolishly thought was the worst one in the film. As always with a 'whodunnit', I was expecting a big reveal at the end and an elaborate recreation of the actual events. However, now it seemed that I already knew whodunnit, and it was simply a case of catching the culprit. While I was still enjoying the film, it did lose some of my interest. But alas, Knives Out was far from being done. As it got towards the conclusion that I believed it would have, it instead, started ramping up again. Introducing evidence that would make everything I thought incorrect. And it was that moment where the film was at its best. And the ending with its grand reveal, well, it was simply sublime.I really like these murder mystery type films, and I'm always on the lookout for good ones. And it would now seem that I have found one of the best ones in recent years. Knives Out truly is a masterful example of how to get the genre right. It never falters at any point, like many others in its genre do, and it kept me guessing and intrigued until the very end. The only thing I now want to do, besides write and talk about it, is watch it again, and see if I can pick up any clues and hints about the way it ends.",Knives Out

It brings some innovation to it by revealing the ""perpetrator"" halfway through the movie. Although, it does resort to some cliches to advance the story.Visually it's also pretty compelling. There are plenty of nice transitions between scenes and nice shots which definitely, especially in-and-out of the mansion where the crime was committed.The acting and characters however, gave me mixed feelings.
There are 2 law officers, in addition to Poirot-esque main detective Benoit Blanc played by Daniel Craig (with a divisive Southern accent). They seem virtually useless to the plot. One seems to be included only for comic relief, but he is not funny at all, unfortunately.
The same goes for the family, aka the suspects. Several lack motive to do the killing, others are too much alike, and some don't play a role at all and therefore could be excluded. When you have such a A-type cast, that did come across to me as a waste.If you are after a classic crime mistery movie, Knives Out is a good choice.

It's just so much fun to watch!There are a lot of reviews here that rate this along the same lines as I do for many of the same reasons - story, cast, direction, production - although they often do not quite rate it a 10. And then there are plenty of reviews that say that this has great acting and production value but is weak sauce for them.The odd thing is that the reviews here run the gamut and I haven't been able to figure out why some people like this and some people don't. I love Poirot and Marple and I thought maybe that was the difference, but there as many people here who love those shows and didn't like this as do. It's weird.Sometimes I write reviews just so I can read them later to remind myself why I liked or didn't like something in case I run across it again, but I almost always include a reason why I think others will or won't like it as well. I saw this movie about a year ago and haven't written a review on it until now because I don't know what makes some people like it and some not. I still don't. It's a mystery. (haha)There is one thing that might mean the difference between a 9 and a 10 for me in rating this movie, and that is that I think every actor in this had a blast making it, and the way they throw themselves into their performances and relish their roles (without overdoing it) is captivating. It's an ensemble cast of famous actors I had seen and some I'd never heard of, including Ana de Armas, who was absolutely amazing, but each and every one of this knocks it out of the park, and many of them play atypical roles, which may be why it seems like they seemed like they were having so much fun with it.In any case, I LOVE this movie and see myself watching it again many more times, even though I know the ending. From the range of reviews here, your mileage may vary, but I felt like adding my opinion to the hundreds here, just for the hell of it.Oh, one last thing. If you did like this, I recommend checking out the Poirot and Marple series', and just for fun, Murder by Death, which is straight up hilarious parody of murder mysteries like this with its own incredible ensemble cast from the 70s.",Knives Out
420,Adam-09265,A grippingly past average whodunnit,8,4 January 2020,"It was gripping from start to finish and i found myself at the edge of my seat towards the end. Daniel Craig smashes the role as the detective even though i found his accent a little forced it was over ruled by his great acting. Heck! they all had great acting throughout.The ending? It was a great twist after an already great twist, i found it clever how the story made us feel one way about certain characters to then make us want to change our mind and then fooling us again.Although to be a bit of a critic, certain points of the movie were a little clichéd for plot convenience, it felt like the story started to convert into cheap ways to try and lay out the ending for us and part of it seemed desperate, leaped and shallow. I'm not contradicting my above praise for the movie i still think it was a great whodunnit just not.....a 10/10 more of an 8/10. Rian Johnson did a good job.",Knives Out

That was my reaction to the beginning of the film. It was nowhere near as funny as I'd hoped it would be (though it does have its lighter moments...Toni Collette's character is pretty amusing). While suspenseful and twisty, I felt that it was a fairly standard ""Agatha Christie"" type mystery. But the ending actually packed a wallop for me as all the threads come together and I realized that, beneath the neat mystery packaging, the movie was trying to say some important things about hypocrisy and kindness. Thumbs up!",Knives Out
423,catfanatic888,Knives Out Was Just OK,7,9 February 2020,I expected a lot more from this well-reviewed and Oscar Nominated film. I found it not funny although it was billed as a comedy.

424,varun-25071997,Best Murder Mystery In Ages,10,29 November 2019,"Whodunnit films are the ones no one ever dislikes. Though it's a rarity today, Rian Johnson has directed the best of the genre in this decade probably. Every second of the film is interesting and it's one of the few films where twists and turns are actually necessary. Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas have given their career best performances. It would be a shame if this movie doesn't get nominated or win any accolades",Knives Out
425,ninjaboyballer,"To all y'all who hate Rian Johnson after Star Wars, maybe this movie will change your mind",10,30 November 2019,"I don't understand why people are judging Rian Johnson for just one movie that they though ruined Star Wars(which in my personal opinion it didn't), but maybe this movie can help people come to their senses on how great of a director Rian Johnson is. Cause in the case of this movie, Knives Out is a expertly crafted murder mystery with thrilling twists, a pitch perfect cast, and a experience for everyone to get a kick out of. Almost every twist in this film got me, except maybe the last one but I was a little tipped in assumptions so it still kinda got me. The cast was also perfect, especially Ana de Armas, who does a really good impression of her illness as well as a really good performance overall and Daniel Craig, who does an excellent job as the detective even though he isn't directly in the first few minutes of the film but immediately makes himself central when brought in. The rest of the cast is just as good as those two and their dynamic feels general and absolutely hilarious at some points. That's also another thing I liked about this movie. It's a murder mystery but it doesn't take itself too seriously. I actually laughed quite a bit during this film and it's all just because of the excellent chemistry of the cast. The movie overall is crafted in a way that's quite distinct from other murder mysteries I've seen and most of that is do to like I said this film not taking itself too seriously. Overall Rian Johnson has once again proven himself a confident director by crafting a well told murder mystery with a cast that feels genuine in their chemistry and twists that you will still be thinking about after the movie is over. So to all of you angry Star Wars nerds, maybe this movie will have you look at Rian a little differently.Final rating: 9.6/10",Knives Out

It takes a well worn storyline and turns it on its head by keeping the viewer off balance more than once as to what is really going on. Terrific acting is a plus. And it doesn't hurt that there are a few moments of levity to lighten the mood too. Thumbs up for this one.",Knives Out
427,untilnow99,Well. That Was a Nice Surprise,9,7 December 2019,"At first there were more than a few things that bugged me about this movie.Jamie Lee Curtis is OLD here. In real life she's only 61, but was this all makeup or has she really aged so horribly? It creeped me out.Toni Collette, whom I loved in 6th Sense and several other films, too, really stank up the screen with her performance. What a shock. Why was she so over the top and cringey in this role?And Daniel Craig's accent. I had a hard time getting used to it, but it did eventually grow on me. As things progressed, I came to enjoy him thoroughly as Benoit (Ben-Wa? Yikes.-----That threw me there. too, for a bit).This film starts out slow. And I mean S-L-O-W. I kept wondering why the IMDb score was so high. I was entirely convinced this was going to be some campy, 2nd rate murder mystery.Then, all of a sudden, things ramp up. Hold onto your hats. Full speed ahead. And WHAT A RIDE.I'm not going to tell you anything else except that this is a movie worth watching. It's pure surprise and excellence. If you like mysteries, you will love Knives Out. The ending is delicious. Absolutely delicious. I love it. Kudos to the writers.Oh: And ""Ransom"" (don't look up the cast----just be pleasantly surprised) is superb in his role, as always. Such a superstar.",Knives Out

Sort of reminds me of how Christmas day turns out in real life. The timing of sequences is very good and a few of the actors are really enjoying themselves. They are very professional in their roles. One of them however comes across as artificial in their allotted role and this spoilt things for me. Frankly I was going to rate it much lower than 7 because it isn't my cup of tea and I was just interested to see it to fill some time ... but if you are a fan of this type of thing, I think you will probably really enjoy it.",Knives Out

The diversity of people plus the dynamism of the script makes the film always propose something new and the funny thing is that when something seems to have closed, something new is discovered that gives a new twist to the story. No leads from the investigation were left unfinished, and I highlight this because it doesn't always happen. I would have liked a little more to play with the variety of characters and their dramas, but in any case it is a personal taste.A very good cast, certain characters seem to be wasted but I understand it. Ana de Armas is very well leading the film with a certain presence, Toni Collette always brilliant and enters her roles in a unique way. Daniel Craig has a mysterious and humorous touch that graduates him satisfactorily.",Knives Out

431,trevorwomble,An old fashioned murder mystery with a modern setting,7,11 December 2019,"This film very much reminds me of a mixture of Poirot and Columbo. I won't bother talking about the plot as a lot of it is already there in other reviews, but I will say it does have an old fashioned 1930s fee to it. An all star cast help propel it along so it doesn't ever get boring and although the story unfolds one section at a time, it is quite cleverly written as to not give the game away too much until the big reveal towards the end (hints of Murder on the Orient Express loom heavily in the background).Whilst ome of the plot is guessable, there are still enough twists to keep it interesting. The cast are all uniformly excellent, and Chris Evans in particular stands out with his spoilt rich kid who may be more than he seems. Daniel Craig's strange southern drawl is perhaps the only reason I haven't given this eight stars. I did find it grates and his characterisation is supposed to represent 'quirky' but I couldn't help but sense the thinly disguised Poirot influence with him. Other than that this was a surprisingly above average film that tries to do something a bit different with its concept.On the whole this is a well made little film and I can see it leading to a sequel",Knives Out
432,mitchell5954,Harmless Fun,7,28 November 2019,"Knives Out is a who done it mystery thriller directed by Rian Johnson. The same director who did The Last Jedi, and has garnered an infamous reputation because of that film as well as his reaction to fan backlash. However, this movie is much more in Johnson's wheelhouse than Star Wars. He excels in more grounded thrillers, which is what this film is. Rian Johnson is a competent director if given the proper material.This is the first mystery thriller of its kind to come out in theatres since Murder on the Orient Express I believe. I liked that film better, but Knives Out, while not great, is a fun time with a stellar cast. You have amazing actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon. Daniel Craig and Chris Evans steal the movie for me, mainly because I love those two as actors. If I had to pick Daniel Craig is the stand out performance here. Yes, his southern accent is over the top, but I think was intentional. Ana de Armas does good in the movie as well. I like her in Blade Runner 2049, and I like her here too.The film is very well shot especially inside the family mansion, which looks fantastic and gives off a great sense of style and atmosphere. Being inside this house gives you the feeling you're watching a period movie, even though it takes place in modern day. Unfortunately, the outside shots don't invoke the same kind of atmosphere.This film, for a who done it story, takes a very interesting turn. It starts out as your typical who done it mystery. But then it gives you significant info early on to make you think you who the culprit is throughout the entire second act, only to spin it around again at the end. It really plays on your expectations. Though, if you were expecting a more straightforward mystery story this might not be for you.The film does get a bit slow in the middle. I'm not saying those scenes didn't need to be there, but I'm just saying the second act is slower isn't as interesting as the first and third acts. Plus a couple of the characters feel pretty stock and disposable.Overall, Knives Out is a fun mystery flick. It's not a masterpiece, but it's style, cast, and character interactions make it a fun time at the movies.",Knives Out

435,DrTuvok,"Whatever this is, it isn't a whodunnit",5,16 June 2020,"I told myself I wouldn't watch any more Rian Johnson films, but ended up watching this anyway. Go figure.Anyway, for a whodunnit to work there has to be a sense of mystery, or paradox, you have to wonder, 'who did it' when anyone could have, and there is no clear explanation. This movie kind of has that in the first half-hour, only for Rian to abruptly reveal everything that happened, and spoilers, it is a suicide. Once he reveals this, the 'whodunnit' pretense completely falls apart and the movie just becomes the story of a Spanish woman inheriting a fortune and dealing with greedy manipulative family members. Sure, you know there's going to be some future developments, but nothing can change the fact that the death was a suicide and then we know that none of the other family members could have 'done it'. Therefore there really isn't that much mystery. Rian shoots himself in the foot once again with his labored cleverness.Side note: Pretty good cast here. Avengers: Endgame convinced me that Chris Evans couldn't act to save his life, but now this movie showed me otherwise. Maybe he was just playing himself. I'm glad Daniel Craig had that absurd accent because it made the movie more entertaining. Also some of the jokes were funny.",Knives Out

Only a couple of things that would have made it better for me:1. They should have either let Daniel Craig use his normal accent, or used an American actor. The accent was grating - especially as he's a main character.2. Potentially unpopular opinion - but I would have liked to see a stronger case for the main suspects (to throw us off the trail). To explain, there was plenty of motive amongst them, but minimal 'evidence' to convince us they were involved. Therefore - when the perpetrator came to light at the end, whilst I didn't expect it, I wasn't particularly shocked / surprised.But overall, there's enough to keep us thinking & intrigued.

He needs to stick with playing James Bond, where his poor acting skill is partially covered by the continuing action scenes. I can't begin to understand why Craig was cast in such a key role.

446,Dello_,A lot of fun,9,5 January 2020,"""Knives Out"" is a 'who done it?' type of movie that follows the established conventions of the genre but it is also a lot more. Indeed it explores new ways to tell the story about the mystery and the solution of the murder that occurs. And I find this aspect so much entertaining because due to the unusual structure I was able to experience different types of anxiety and curiosity for a movie like this. And it has some funny moments too.
In this context Rian Johnson manages to explore some deeper themes like the importance of behave respecting the others and the main one that is about racism. These themes are not showed in a direct way but in a more metaphorical one that is not omnipresent at all and so they absolutely don't prevaricate the main mystery itself but enriches the story.

447,ccamp89,Solid 3.5 // Shines brightest when focused on the ensemble,7,7 December 2019,"An entertaining murder mystery with a colorful cast and playful energy. The first half or so is particularly strong and layers on the plot twists at a satisfying clip. The film is at its strongest when the ensemble convenes and the characters are able to play off of one another. As the plot progresses though, there is increasingly less opportunity for this and the film narrows its focus to only a few characters for a significant portion of the run time. It loses some of its charm in the process and the double, triple, and quadruple plot reversals start to feel shallow when the humanity of the characters has taken a back seat. I also didn't care so much for the forced political commentary, not because it wasn't an interesting angle to take but rather the execution just felt a bit too obvious and preachy.

The mannerisms of the characters suit them well making us like the good guys and sense disgust for others.

An immensely entertaining, thrillingly escapist whodunnit that pulls the rug out from underneath you more times than you can count. Every line has a payoff, every hint has a resolution. It's razor sharp and uproariously funny, with Johnson giving every cast member enough juice to play with but plenty of room to still have their own unique kinds of fun. It's a writers' movie through and through, but the cast still shine.Saying any more and properly diving into what Johnson is really doing here risks spoiling elements the film, and Knives Out is not a story you want spoiled. Johnson reliably plays with formula, he riffs on Vertigo and adds layer upon layer, having a blast as he does so - and it's infectious.

In terms of storytelling, there is a lot of flashback (some right, some wrong) and the accompanying interrogation.The characters are for the very most part interesting and very well acted (although they do portray strong character stereotypes - so not too subtle) - but the chemistry and likability/or dis-likability .. is that a word? .. is quite well done.While the plot is straight forward, it quickly gets more complex - morally as well as technically .. but never so convoluted that one is not able to follow it anymore.conclusion: i can fully recommend this movie.

It's one of the few examples with his work where I can actually get behind some of the expectation subversions because they actually make sense and don't ruin the established tone (unlike The Last Jedi). In fact I had no idea where it was going after the first act because it took the mystery, told us what happened (which I won't spoil) and then turns into more of a general mystery of double crosses and character motives that culminate at the end nicely. Also it has Chris Evans telling people to eat s!%t, so what's there not to like about that?",Knives Out

462,boe_dye,Mediocre and obvious,1,24 July 2020,"**Probably Spoilers**Like J.J. Abrams I do not get the appeal of Rian Johnson. The story as it is, really has nothing to do with the murder mystery (which isn't really a mystery -- you can pretty much guess what it's about in the first 10 minutes), but more so about a singular character.The film moves from one scene to the next, telling you every little thing that is happening rather than showing you -- a major flaw in the past ten years of cinema. Movies used to show you a story, now they are all about telling you the story rather than allowing it to unfold with good acting.I was bored about 15 minutes in and by 30 minutes I had just decided to skip all the way to the end (not that I had seemingly missed much) and sure enough the outcome was what I thought it was going to be. As I stated above, in the first 10 minutes you ought be able to at least put together what's going to happen much like you could with Shutter Island.Not really sure how people compare this to a good Agatha Christy novel, and in many ways this is like a very poorly written mix between The Orient Express, Clue, and the Last Express (the game by Jordan Mechner). Boorish, juvenile, kind of pointless and not at all worth the time it takes to watch it for free on Prime or Netflix.I'm not sure if this was an apology to Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer for their ""roles"" in Star Wars, and supposedly somewhere in this film was an underlying trolling to the Star Wars fans who hated the Last Jedi -- if there was I completely missed it, but probably because certain folks just can't meme.OH... and I'm not sure what the random conversation about social issues and politics were about, perhaps as a jab at more conservative minded people, but quite frankly any talk of politics in movies is just a flat out turn off anymore. It's bad enough that the alphabet networks and cram it down our throats, as well as the social engineering platforms 24/7, but I would personally like to have a break from such things when I'm entering into another world, not have it subtly dropped for whatever reasons...Plus it makes it really difficult to watch over again as no one will care in ""x"" years anyhow as most of the commentary are pulled from the moments trending on twitter at the time of writing.Otherwise, 45 minutes of my life gone including the time it took me to write up this review -- but I like to have an excuse to keep up the practice of writing, so hooray me. At least I didn't give this movie and Rian anymore of my time, and nor will I be bothering to in the future.",Knives Out

469,Benslie,A good murder mystery for people that things go over their heads easily,9,29 November 2019,"First of all, I know this is weird to start out with but the musical score, composed by Nathan Johnson, was amazing and helped bring people into that old school murder mystery feel. The music sounded like it came straight out of an old mystery movie. The acting in this film was well done by everybody but three people really stood out to me. The first-person being Chris Evans, who plays Ransom Drysdale. He's mainly known for playing Captain America and this role showed people another side to him that I really hope we get to see more of because he played this character to perfection and I just have to say this because Marvel geek but somebody needed to tell him to watch his language. The second person is Daniel Craig who has a weird accent in this movie that needs time getting used to but it doesn't take away from this marvelous performance. One thing that I love about mystery movies is the detective's process of figuring out the case and he delivered on just that. The last stand out is Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera. This movie could have easily lost me but she was one of the main reasons I kept interested in this movie because she brings so much to this role that it captivates you and want to try and help her out. Now, I will say this if you can easily pick up on things then this might not be the movie for you because after the big reveal happens you realize all of the clues that you should have picked up on and face palming, personal experience. In the end, Knives Out is a great movie for everybody and I do recommend seeing it. But, like I said if you can easily pick up on things, which I usually can but due to the annoying person next to me I couldn't, then you might not enjoy it as much.",Knives Out

473,GavWaskett,Cable Knit Sweaters are going to make a big comeback!,7,13 September 2020,"Initially I avoided this film because the trailer just didn't do anything for me, and Daniel's Craig Deep South accent generally puts me off any film it appears in. But I was convinced by positive reviews from friends, yep I'm looking at you Dave!Wealthy patriarch of the Thrombey family - Harlan (Christopher Plummer) commits suicide and his dysfunctional and money hungry family come a calling. The police have to make sure the cause of death was suicide and then things get a bit back stabby and mystery based. Well, you actually find out what happened to Harlan about halfway through the film but the rest is the real mystery part.If Carlsberg did film casts, then this would be right up there. I could go on and on about how great this cast is and it is, Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Riki Lindhome are as always superb, I mean that is a dream team of actors and actresses right there. But I wanted to focus on just a couple of members of the cast. First up, Captain America himself Chris Evans, after the Avengers, this is his first big film outside of the universe, it is nice to see him playing a more complex and less heroic character and much as I loved him as Cap, I'm looking forward to seeing him spread his acting wings now. Then you have Daniel Craig and his accent and you know what I was able to ignore it and focus on a great performance, he plays a detective who at first seems a bit out of place but soon develops into
Columbo/Quincy/Poirot and Miss Marple all in one package. His revel at the end is in the best detective tradition. We also have Ana de Armas as Marta, Harlan's nurse and the true star of this star-studded film. A Cuban actress who though appearing in quite a few films, this is the first time she's really taken centre stage. She's great in this role as someone trying to do what's right in a really mucked up situation whilst being played by everyone around her. And finally, Katherine Langford as one of the younger Thrombey's and Marta's friend who is torn between friendship and family, a real case of nature vs nurture - she and miss de Armas should both be stars of the future.I went into this film with quite low expectations and was very happily surprised, there are a few twists and turns and to be fair they're quite easy to spot a mile off. If you don't know who the baddie of this film is straight away then you need to watch more films! But is well-written with some fantastic ideas and an interesting path to get to the conclusion. It is sharp and witty and Chris Evans single handily has revived the chunky knit wear industry. The cast is stellar and Rian Johnson holds it all together with superbly, not a surprise as he wrote it as well. Each cast member on the poster deserves 1 point, Mr Johnson 2(1 for writing and 1 for directing) and because I was wrong, Mr Craig's accent can get a point and finally Dave earns the film another point by convincing me to give it ago. So, 15/20 for a film I had no interest in. Nice one murderous type peeps! I'm off to buy a White Cable Knit Sweater.",Knives Out

476,jackson_ro,Knives Out,5,5 May 2020,"Knives out seems like unflappable plot; a tested formula in creating a successful suspense film, but it never reaches the height of movies like Murder on the Orient Express. While the icing is still left towards the end, too much of the suspense was gradually peeled away, so did most of the glitter and interest along the way. This type of film, you either leave everything towards the end to be revealed and until then you keep leaving bread crumbs for audiences to pick up, which may take a long time, or you keep revealing plots until the finale, so Rian Johnson was left in a tough spot, and the end product is less than satisfying, not saying he made the wrong decision. A group of interesting characters were created, unfortunately Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas' characters were way too stereotypical and the least interesting of them all.

479,shimenpf,Oscar-worthy,8,15 December 2019,"The simple structure of the screenplay is fascinating. It starts with an introduction to both the characters and a basic idea of what happened the night of the crime. As the story advances and unfolds, it picks on each element established in the set-up to expand on it and deliver more clues as to what really happened.
Simultaneously, we're surprisingly revealed to the, we think, murderer. It's a beautiful case of study, because the precise murder is what makes us feel empathy for the protagonist, Marta. Then, we follow the story seeing Benoit Blanc as the antagonist that attempts to capture Marta. The film takes advantage of this by building tension and conflict and the loose ends of the murder. As things escalate, we begin to see there is something behind all that. The action and tension is impressive and non-stop and, even with a runtime of over 2 hours, there is not a single second that is boring.
The film uses every single element it established for turns, twists, or tension/conflict-building in an impressive way.The only 'but' I can mention is the climax that, for me, felt just a little underwhelming. However, this can be due to my own hypothesis, and I wouldn't blame the film for that.Overall, this is a must see.",Knives Out
480,fdbjr,Reviewing the Director,4,28 November 2019,"Rian Johnson is a pretty hot property right now, what with the Star Wars credits, a decent science fiction movie, and so on. For a number of critics, the analysis of the movie ends there.Because this is flat out not a very good movie. The twists are not prdictable - far from it - so incredibly complex as to be completely unbelievable. At the center of the plot is an absolute absurdity. The patriarch of the family apparently committed suicide by cutting his own throat - an incredibly painful way to die - because he thought he had been accidentally overdosed with morphine. Absolutely absurd. Only he hasn't been overdosed because of an incredibly contrived series of events . . .. . . all of which have nothing to do with the various motivations of his heirs to do him in, established in some detail - the most entertaining part of the movie. As the movie goes on and drifts into the detail necessary to make all of the preposterous contrivances work, all this interesting background is completely lost, or ignored.Along the way a police lab is completely destroyed by the simple expedient of throwing an arson device through a window, because you know how insecure those places are.

484,TheCasualReviewer,I think we have a.... good film on our hands...,7,26 April 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
The famous Mystery novel write, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), has been murdered and Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) was anonymously hires to solve the murder and suspects one of the family. Or was it the nurse?REVIEW:
If you're looking for a film that the whole family can get into and have a fun time with, this is it. A ""who-done-it"" that doesn't take itself seriously. This film does, however, have a lot of social commentary where they clearly have characters that highlight a lot of those in modern society. Whether it's poking fun at SJWs or having a debate on the status of immigration in this country. I wouldn't say the film is for political people, but the characters will definitely make some laugh at how over-the-top they are. Daniel Craig is amazing at the stereotypical private investigator. Almost cartoonish in how he talks and almost film-noir esc. I also specifically loved Toni Colette's character and how very Valley-girl she is. All that aside, the absolute stand-out performance is Ana de Armas as the Nurse, Marta. I could've definitely seen her as a nomination at the oscars. She's the center-piece of the film or the ""donut hole that fills the hole of the donut"" in Blanc's terms. I felt everything she was going through and I was heavily rooting for her hoping she didn't make the ""nice"" choices. At times the film could be a little slow and it could've been cut down a little, but in the end I really enjoyed this film and I was a fan of the ending. 7.7/10.",Knives Out

And the nurses mother has been in the states for how long? Like anyone gives a sh$& at this point that she's an illegal immigrant. Like, keep the money and get her citizenship, just dumb. And she vomits over lying but not the site of a man cutting his own throat?? I love Daniel Craig and I don't think his accent was bad but it wasn't the usual so it throws people.

487,Criticalstaff,Classic murder-mystery,5,28 April 2020,"Knives out is a typical murder-mystery movie. It is the first movie Rian Johnson made after Star Wars the Last Jedi, and that in itself is more puzzling than anything that you see in the movie.It is very classical in its approach: there is a murder; it is a mystery of who done it. The twist on the premise is that the murder is not actually a murder and we follow the investigation through the eyes of the perpetrator.I feel in a lot of ways similar emotion as when watching the Last Jedi. In theme, tone and subject these movies are obviously very different, but there is something distinctively Johnson-esque, to both of them. They are a re-telling in a Rian Johnson fashion of movies/tropes that we are familiar with (that lead to an end-result that is arguably underwhelming).For one thing all the ingredients are good or excellent. The actors are all great to the point where I regret not seeing more about them. The characters are somewhat stereotypical but that is expected from these types of movies. The set design is cool, it is a mix of quirky and gothic. There are callbacks to classical horror/thrillers, but it remains light and playful. The costumes are also very well made and are used to convey information efficiently. The cinematography is not anything groundbreaking, but I felt that there was an effort to emphasize the sets and the costumes and therefore the put forward the tone and the plot.The plot is Achilles Heel of the movie. Not that it is bad, but it is merely passable. For all the flair and ingenuity the movie displays it is rather bland. The plot has twists, it had turns. Some characters are charming, some characters are despicable. There not really any element that stands out.Also you don't really get anything form it. There is no moral, no metaphor. There is not really any kind of reflection on anything.
To be fair, there is a mention of politics in the film, and there might be some commentary on immigration or immigrants. But it is too subtle to be taken seriously. The political commentary the film has, is more evocative than definitive. It feels sneaky. It feels more like a way to ground the film or to do characterization rather than an honest take on the topic. There is one character that is alt-right, but it does not inform on his behavior or his motives. He is just alt-right.
There is no broader meaning to the film.In a way that was not what I was expecting from the movie, and it is not something the movie advertised. The feeling I have is that this movie, with everything that it is and that is does, could have been a quiet masterpiece. Instead it is rather prude, bland and frankly forgettable.",Knives Out

491,quiqueperezsoler,"Enthralling and entertaining ""whodunnit"" movie but a bit overrated and underuses a great cast",7,1 September 2020,"The most popular whodunnit mystery genre is back in a fancy, non-groundbreaking and enthrallingly delivered story about a murder and its resolution by private eye Benoit Blanc. Overall the movie is entertaining as well as well-realised in the modern world. In a world were cameras, smartphones and internet reign, ""getting away with murder"" Agatha Christie style is not easy to pull off.However, Rian Johnson proves his worth as a talented director and writer with this film. After his unfortunate contribution to the Star Wars lore, many were scrutinizing his later works to try to proof his seemingly ""unworthiness"" to contribute to such a famous saga. Hopefully this entry would prove them wrong.It's always hard to talk about the plot of a Clue-like movie such as this as the mystery is the central core of it. Therefore, I'll focus on the performances of the cast and the development of the case itself. Contrary to other movies and books of the similar genre, this film takes some liberties that may be new to it(I haven't watched every movie of the whodunnit genre so I can't confirm this case). It doesn't really follow the private detective. I'd say he isn't the ""main protagonist"" of this story at all. Or at least the story isn't channeled through him. At the end of the day, it's not his home where the audience goes to rest from the case, it's someone else's. And I am afraid saying the name might reveal a clue so I'll just not mention it at all.I'd say the performances are extraordinary and enthralling but that is not the case because they are almost nonexistent. The biggest downside the movie has is that it features a lot of talent with an impressive track record and yet they are misused. They seem to be there merely to bring in big names to lure people in to watch it. But each participation serves a very superficial role in the story and after that they are nowhere to be found. In fact, it'd be incredibly damaging if the movie didn't turn out to be greatly performed by those who have more screen time/are central to the plot and the story itself wasn't so well delivered and paced.As for the development of the case, I'd say it isn't too convoluted nor is it trying to be to confuse the audience. It doesn't want to create a complex mystery in order to make the audience gasp at the reveal of the culprit. However this reveal is a staple of the genre so expect it and look foward to it. I simply personally thought it was given away too soon in the story and from then on there wasn't much mystery left. And again, I feel the misuse of the other characters missed the opportunity to suggest other possible culprits that would have added more ""juice"" to the mystery.However, there are very few subplots to keep track of so everything is understood from the beginning. There is no reason to have to focus on the details and scene clues and hints, no matter how subtle they are, to keep up or allow the audience to come to those conclusions by themselves. Something I personally think it's one of the genre's highlights as they make me ""feel smarter"" and even more involved in the plot. Additionally, I also believe it robs the movie of a more dramatic reveal of the culprit as well as its very own rewatchability. The plot is too straightforward and un-entangled to leave the audience wanting to figure it out on their own. But again, the simplicity of the plot may have been a director's choice and the focus of the movie might have lied elsewhere.IN CONCLUSION, this movie is perfectly entertaining, easy to watch and follow, and amusing at some points. It's high level cast provide a good performance despite the little dialog and intervention they had they made the most of it and it contributes to the movie. The case was interesting, well-paced and delivered and straightforward. The ""twist"" is not really its strongest suit nor is it its whodunnit convoluted multi-focused plot development. So in other words, it contributes to the genre and doesn't really redefine it, so hardcore mystery fans may be underwhelmed with it. Especially after all the praise it received and is receiving. It's simply average with good entertainment value.",Knives Out

496,Waedliman,Failing right from the start,4,25 August 2020,"Let´s have a look at ""Death on the Nile"", the first one. Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Peter Ustinov, David Niven, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow and many more made that 1978 movie a perfect example for classic style, witty dialogue and suspense in the gold old Agatha Christie way. ""Knives Out"" ist destined to go on that trip but 40 years later they simply don´t know how to do it. It starts with the cast of which only Toni Collette convinced me. As always she knows how to create a character without overdoing it. If you need a lesson in bad acting, just have a look at Daniel Craig as the private eye. I am German but I take the guess that his southern accent is completely wrong. And so is his acting. What is his character about? I don´t care, the same goes for the rest of the cast which I don´t blame on the actors per se, it´s the script that´s lousy and the dialogue could win with more one-liners and sophistication. But it doesn´t have all that. And the story? Very transparent from the beginning and the whodunit aspect is wasted on a rather uptight attempt to make sure the story is twisted. It isn´t really, but that´s for everybody to find out. I wasted my time with this and don´t know where the 7.9 comes from.",Knives Out

498,ernestsavesxmas,a completely enjoyable movie,8,5 April 2020,"Knives Out is a completely enjoyable movie. That's it! I recommend watching it if it seems like something you might be into (well-acted mystery movies with well known stars). Why it feels like a slight to not bestow this film with an avalanche of additional praise, I'm not sure. There's an odd cult around Rian Johnson that feels manufactured. He's a really good filmmaker, both technically-speaking and at putting together a compelling story with his screenplays. He's no genius, however. This film is a super fun romp, but it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Its twists aren't that twisty. Its Scooby Doo ending is highly Scooby Doo ish. I'm glad this film made a lot of money and has a lot of fans, because it is really good. That's it. That's the review.",Knives Out
499,lucifer_over_tinseltown,Twists and shouts,9,12 April 2020,"This one really shakes it up, baby. More twists than a naked game of twister...which, of course, is strictly verboten while we all live the quarantined dream. So watch this masked & gloved instead. By far Rian Johnson's best work since that triple lindy of Breaking Bad episodes he directed. Looper was a turkey best forgotten. Daniel Craig is probably pound for pound the worst James Bond of all-time, but he's top notch as the Foghorn Leghorn meets Sherlock Holmes detective here. Worst affected southern accent since David Bowie's absurd appearance in Twin Peaks Fire Walk w/ Me though. This is why I didn't rate it a 10. Speaking of, Ana de Armas' performance is a pleasant surprise here as well. Best known as Ben Affleck's latest conquest (dude constantly out kicks his coverage somehow), she steals the show with an elegantly understated, immediately believable character and first rate acting. Not an easy thing to pull off considering the giant, trophy snatching cast. The lie detector thing, which I won't spoil, is a brilliant plot device, one of many slightly vulgar delights to be found in the dazzling guts of this immersive film. Those who have played Clue, may think they have an edge (the game is hilariously referenced at one point...very meta) -- and the trailer kind of misrepresented the film as just that -- but believe you me there is much more afoot in this near masterpiece.",Knives Out

504,MovieWarfare,Flipping the Whodunit genre on its head,9,22 February 2020,"Knives out is advertised as a whodunit movie. In a way it sort of is but this is Rian Johnson, he loves subverting expectations. Seriously though, this movie really subverts a lot of expectations. It's better to go into this movie with little to no knowledge which is why it is difficult to review this without giving away too much.First off, this movie has an amazing cast with Daniel Craig pulling off an American accent as the private investigator. Chris Evans post Avengers work has him play a much more terrible character which is a huge contrast to Captain America. Christopher Plummer while a minor role gives a very lovable mystery novelist. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson and Toni Colette give a very convincing performance as egotistic rich snobs. Ana de Armas must be praised as well for being able to convincing give the audience a sort of POV character in this massive all star cast. I will also give props to Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell and Noah Segan as well as they did a great job as well. The story and the screenplay is just phenomenal with the witty and charming dialogue. Likewise, the twist are smart and really keep the audience on its toes.I do struggle to find negatives but I guess the one and only true blatant negative is the very obvious political message. ""Right white conservative"" are bad. The movie doesn't emphasise it a lot but there are scenes where is delves into these such as immigration and having the white rich characters talk quite negatively about it. Likewise emphasising how the children of Christopher Plummer's character have not earned anything of their own legitimately or have been given massive money to earn anything. It's a very simple and obvious message that anyone can see throughout the entire film. Additionally, maybe the misleading advertisement can be quite a deterrent to some viewers. As stated at the beginning, Rian Johnson completely flips the Whodunit genre on its head but the trailers and advertisement suggest it is just a typical whodunit story when it really isn't. To me this isn't exactly a negative but it could be seen as such to other viewers.In conclusion, this is a must watch to everyone. It is such an entertaining movie and is a great reminded of films from the old Hitchcock days. While the director's previous work, The Last Jedi, was divisive; This movie is amazing. Give it a watch!",Knives Out
505,dmasursky,Disappointed,6,23 November 2019,"What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. It's hard to believe that this is the same writer/director as Brick, which is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This movie doesn't have nearly as much sly humor as that movie. It's not particularly witty and it's not really a sendup of the genre, either. Not a complete waste of time, but not what I was hoping for either.",Knives Out
506,muons,An entertaining and hilarious story,10,18 January 2020,"Mystery crime has long been a neglected genre in the movie industry with cheap and boring TV flicks like Murder She Baked, etc. With its star-studded cast and intelligent plot, Knives Out is certainly a refreshing and hopefully a revitalizing comeback. Although it feels like a modern day Agatha Christie adaptation with little new to offer, all its cinematographic qualities like acting, directing, scripting, editing are top notch. Despite the abundance of leading figures, the characters are surprisingly well developed and they are far from simplistic and single-dimensional. Take Joni, for example. When it comes to her personal interests and benefits, she sees nothing wrong with scheming a large sum of money from her father-in-law. Her political views on a polarizing subject like immigration, however, are progressive and humanitarian.
Indeed, the subject of immigration is the permeating subtle theme of the movie although the main plot revolves around a crime puzzle. The protagonist is a daughter of an illegal immigrant family from Latin america. She works as a caregiver to a bunch of wealthy white people none of whom has no real accomplishments but lives a posh life by simply leeching off of the rich patriarch. Most of their qualities are pretentious and skin-deep. Even the impressive ""ancestral manor"" turns out to be an estate bought from a Pakistani tycoon some 40 years ago. I don't want to give away too much from the plot but the final scene metaphorically and hilariously clinches the underlying subject-matter.
All in all, Knives Out is an entertaining movie which certainly deserves seeing.",Knives Out

510,RetroRick,"Lower your expectations & you'll enjoy, raise them too much & you'll be disappointed",6,6 January 2020,"Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though",Knives Out

512,otnememento-2,Wonderful surprise,9,11 December 2019,"After watching the trailer I was not very sure what to expect but that made it a bigger surprise. First of all it is highly above average quality in todays movies. In addition if an actor can make you forget he is James Bond in the first seconds on a screen he is a pretty good actor, and that's what Daniel Craig does in this movie. Everyone is just perfect, what an incredible amount of talent. To sum up, just González watch it. It is one of those little gems we seldom find among the usual blockbusters.",Knives Out
513,GazWatson,Pretty bland,5,28 November 2019,"A pretty bland whodunit that think's it's more intelligent than it is.

In the films defence, the cast are all excellent",Knives Out
514,Mike_O_Dwyer,A Try Hard Farce,7,29 December 2019,"While not anywhere near as clever as it would like to think it is, there's a lot to like about Rian Johnson's Knives Out. There's an almost comic book pantomime quality to it all, a farcical Agatha Christie filled with Cluedo styled characters who serve their limited purpose as red herrings with aching archness.There's the bitterly cynical rich old man, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who dies on a night when he is surrounded by his children, their partners, grandchildren, and caretakers, most of whom have a higher opinion of themselves and their achievements than Harlan does.It's obvious everyone's enjoying themselves, most of all Daniel Craig. Chris Evans chews up his bad boy role. Toni Collette is fabulously OTT as a sleepy eyed health guru. Jamie Lee Curtis sneers derisively at everything she disagrees with, which is mostly everything, including husband Don Johnson. Ana de Armas flitters about as the hapless caretaker. Christopher Plummer enjoys himself immensely as the man with all the money in the world who laughs last before he pops his clogs.Then there's a will.There's a dispute over whether Harlan's death is suicide or murder.And there's Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc, who deserves another run out as the Southern fried consulting investigator. Everyone involved gets their moment to shine, with the initial questioning session giving them all the chance to show how good and decent they are which may come back to haunt them as the story plays out.It does sag in the second third before gathering pace and racing towards the finale, one of those intricate Agatha Christie double-triple twists in the tail that really doesn't feel as though it's anything more than a handy way to tidy things up despite relying on far too many coincidences. There's few things more frustrating in cinema than watching a movie that tries to be so very smart and then trips up over its own laces as it approaches the finish line.There's no shock in the revelation that it was this thing all along, you just go along with it because this is where you've been led and it's just not entirely satisfying. Pity.",Knives Out

No spoilers here, but you know exactly whodunit at the very beginning of the film- it's just the story evolves around that information, adding convoluted plot twists involving a couple other characters. The trailer makes it seem like it's some deep mystery up until the end when in reality you know exactly how the murder happens within the first 30 minutes of the film and very little changes, except the story becomes unnecessarily complicated as it progresses (they had to fill 2 hours somehow). Plenty of pointless political commentary provided as well, with the scales tipped heavily in favor of Leftist ideals, needlessly injecting opinions from the filmmakers about how Republicans are Nazis, and other lies. So edgy...so woke! What an over-hyped waste of 2 hours.",Knives Out

When I saw the trailer for this, I thought it was going to be a goofy parody of the murder mystery genre.

I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters or how the old bloke died.Amateurish acting and Daniel Craig's accent was shockingly bad. I always thought he was a good actor but after this shambles I have changed my point of view.The film dragged on and on and on with very predictable twists here and there, but due to poor character development and as all were totally dislikeable why would we care. Obviously we are supposed to root for the nurse but whatever.Don't believe the hype with this. It's boring, close up face shots throughout which would be better for TV, cringeworthy lead from Craig and no dynamic direction or cinematography.I'll never get that time back or money.Pathetic.",Knives Out

Agatha Christie thriller mystery set in today's world, with a little touch of leftist message, though Johnson actually mocked both sides of the political spectrum in throughout the story, the one thing that I actually found hilariously entertaining. Everyone did a good job on the roles they played, though I think Daniel Craig is out of his own character playing the relatively cheerful detective, because to me, he'll always be the deadly serious, womanizer 007 agent. The plot twist is unexpectable, some of the morals of the story are delivered well, and ended with what I would say (and think) describes Johnson's alignment regarding the world's issues (well you already can see it in his 2017's Last Jedi about that). So far not bad, but it's not too spectacular or mind-blowing to me, just good, which is enough.",Knives Out

He fits this part so well I firmly believe he could pull off the Pink Panther role in a heartbeat. And the rest of the cast are memorable and make this a great movie with plenty of 'twisty bits' that help to keep you wondering right up until the inevitable 'room full of suspects' scene.The cinematography is one of the greatest parts of this movie, the sets are somewhat limited (it's a manor house detective movie, what do you expect!), but if you have a tendency to admire the photographers artistry, you will with this. The panning and focus isn't something that I would normally notice, but in this it is carried out with utter perfection, which adds a depth of art that is frequently missed, or simply not present, in many of today's offerings.Synopsis: great set, great acting, great story and delivers the required caveats when and where required.

534,IreneWatsonC,Restore facts,8,5 April 2020,"If we look at this movie with a murderous purpose, it is not very difficult. However, finding the murder is not the main purpose of this movie, it is to restore the facts. It took two hours to determine that there was no very large space for so many characters to play more completely, which naturally cut off the difficulty for the audience to find the murder. But fortunately, the overall storytelling rhythm is very stable, and it can handle well in the face of so many characters. Moreover, the connection of many details and the final conversion and transmission can be said to be a very complete reasoning movie. No matter what the truth is, whether it is good or evil, as long as the knives out, what is pierced is human nature. Generally speaking, it is a breakthrough movie. Besides, I think that other characters can be more plump. With so many characters, most of them are marginal characters, which is a bit regretful.",Knives Out

I must admit that on first hearing Daniel Craig's southern accent I found it a little odd, but on watching him in the rest of the film, he was just brilliant and played a great part. For us he was no longer Craig but the P.I. At times, early on, his character reminded me of inspector Clouseau, when the the clues were right under his nose and he was completely missing them. Very funny.I didn't know what to expect and as the story unfolded we wondered where it was going and who did what. It is so well acted, with the great cast bringing all the characters to life. It was comical how the family 'loved' Marta, the nurse, and thought of her as 'one of the family', yet each one gave a different country of her origin! Proving that actually, they didn't - as long she looked after Dad/Grandpa, they couldn't care less about her.I loved the way that Craig's private detective put all the clues together, just as Christie did in her books. Curtis was great too, as usual.I only recognised Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig in the cast, as I'd not heard of the others, and it shows you really don't need famous faces to make a great film.",Knives Out

And his course of presence and action with the nurse in addition to his name makes it obvious.The truth is affirmed when the detective revealed his deductions. It was Ransom who swapped the contents of the nurse's medication vials and stole the antidote. But the nurse was able to tell the difference between medication, and gave him the correct one. She thought she gave the wrong one, and hence, Harlan decided to kill himself.Later on, we are reminded how messed up the family is, and how they treated the nurse.

544,andrewburgereviews,Backstabbers,8,12 March 2020,"There is a very good reason why I mean ""backstabbers"" and not ""backstabber"" despite the fact that, for those who watched the movie, this whodunit resumes to one miscreant. It is because with ""Knives Out"", director/writer Rian Johnson created a cast of really unlikable characters--in a good way. If a noire is known for casting evil shadows over everyone, including men who are not inherently evil, then this movie, by definition, is not a noire--it is the opposite: everyone is evil and there are no shadows, but cheeky attitudes and bleakness.The title is adequate--after Harlan Thrombey, the patriarch of an eccentric, combative family and owner of a large publishing company dies in mysterious circumstances, very few of his family members mourn his passing. They are all metaphorically armed with knives, ready to stab each other in the back for the opportunity this arises. To legendary and aptly named private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) and to us, they all look capable of murder. His family is so well-written, and the movie introduces them all alongside with clear motives in such a way that by the end, whoever's done the deed is as good as anyone else. Not even the innocent caretaker of the family who has befriended Harlan more than anyone else, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) is completely eliminated from suspicion and this makes the movie work. For de Armas, this is the role to make her career. She proves through her performance she can handle the pressure of the leading act.""Knives Out"" is an entertaining movie to watch and it's all due to its characters more than anything else. Blanc is such a charismatic man! His flamboyance, his Dick Tracy style, this is essentially James Bond if he was born in Mississippi and done police work instead of secret service--he is the kind of guy in cartoons sniffing around with a magnifying glass (something he almost does at one point). Daniel Craig shows off some really comedic chops, all while Johnson is careful not to ridicule him and turning the character into a parody. He is nearly perfect. His Scooby-doo untangling of the case at the end is mesmerizing. And even if you might figure out some of what will unfold--as I did, it is impossible to come up with the entire package. Johnson really went over-the-top with this, almost to a point of paranoia, making sure everyone will be satisfied and surprised with the ending.Granted, ""Knives Out"" can be pretty cold. Its attitude resumes to legislative justice and it doesn't go in-too deep about morality or mourning except the usual ""be your own man"" and ""be kind and you will be rewarded"" novelties. It does go a bit into racism and migration. Marta, the South-American immigrant whose actual country each member of the family mixes up, is at one point drawn to a dispute about illegal immigrants. The hypocrisy of the Thrombeys is visible as they synthetically pat themselves on the back for the simple fact they accept an immigrant into their midst. It's an ignorant and intriguing form of racism which involves privileged ignoramuses being aware and proud of the fact they accept ""lower"" people.Through its circle of knives--both metaphorically and literally--Johnson does manage to find a soft spot of humanity in a scene involving Thrombey's elderly mother Wanetta--who says only about two sentences the entire movie and Blanc. He sympathizes with her struggles with old age and her mourning. Even if his poetic play-of-words is only done to withdraw information, the scene is great in the sense that it draws our attention towards a character who we might've taken as comic relief up until that point.This movie is for your mind more than for your soul. Even the epic, multi-leveled final shot evokes politics more than human understanding. But I won't argue. Both the former and the latter are necessary.",Knives Out

So knives out is directed by Rian Johnson, the guy who directed the infamous Last Jedi , but the movie I know him from his ' Looper ' which is quite awesome and made me look forward to this movie as well . The story is about the death of a mystery writer followed by a real time cluedo game with his family. If you've read enough Agatha Christie and Harry Potter you're gonna put the pieces in a matter of seconds , for those of you didn't , you'll have fun . What I loved about it was how they revealed the mystery a few mins into the movie and yet spun a tight web around it . The movie stars an ensemble cast of Daniel craig , Chris Evans , Michael Shannon , Ana de Armas and many more , the huge cast wasn't a marketing stunt and every character had a purpose followed by proper screen time , they were like the pilot episode of a great sitcom, being likeable characters at first sight . The movie is also beautifully shot and masterfully edited and I bet it's getting nominated for an academy for any of those . I also liked how the movie was able to tonally shift seemlessly from one part murder mystery parody to one part black comedy to one part thriller , and Rian Johnson handles that like a pro . My only gripes with this movie was Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn like accent which turned out to be intentional and pointed out towards the end . So with great characters , edge of the seat edits , masterful shots , one liners which land and one literal cluedo game , Knives out is an instant classic and Rian Johnson's biggest apology letter for the last Jedi .",Knives Out

His nurse and friend, Marta, is left the majority of his worldly possessions, and amidst the outrage of his family and the police investigation regarding his untimely death, there is intrigue abound. Marta is technically the protagonist, but she is more of a vehicle for the plot to develop than a player in the game. She is passive in her fate, and her redeeming quality is her niceness. This is shoved down the throat of the audience so many times in literal phrasing that it becomes distasteful and almost suspicious. If you have to TELL us she is nice, then there is a failure to show us, and it is a missed opportunity. As we see the events of the fatal night play out from many different perspectives, it becomes clear that even her hand in Harlan (the patriarchs) death was accidental and passive.

They need to be fired for incompetence.So we have a gathering at a large country estate of a wealthy family celebrating the 80th birthday of its patriarch and source of income to all. He is discovered dead with his throat slashed the next morning. Enter the police and a private detective. Every family member and household servant is a suspect.Does this sound a bit predictable? Haven't we seen endless variations on this formula before? Except that here it starts to sag not long after the entrance of the police and - especially - once the private detective opens his mouth, it never recovers.While there is fine work (as always) from the great Christopher Plummer, almost everyone else seems out of place or uncomfortable with their roles.Chris Evans is an embarrassment and needs to stick to being a comic book character. He is clearly capable of nothing more.What totally kills this piece of fluff is the unimaginable casting of Daniel Craig (who is not aging well; he certainly can afford some work on his now-drooping eyes) as Benoit Blanc, the world-renowned private detective, profiled in The New Yorker. With that name, you'd expect someone eccentric, a bit humorous, and perhaps with a French accent.But no. Craig sounds like Lindsay Graham trying to speak with a British accent, but an octave lower His endless repeats of the facts of the alleged murder are nauseating and so distracting that I spent one entire scene trying to identify the soprano singing an aria from ""La traviata"" in the background. I just had to tune him out.And then I checked the time again and found that the big reveal - typical in such a formulaic movie - of the family being gathered for the final evidence to be presented and the murderer named occurs some 20 minutes before it actually collapses and dies.With the other American movies mentioned this year for possible Oscar nominations or the actual Golden Globe nominations, I have officially lost all interest and trust in films from that country. The best English-language films I saw this year are from Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and they will likely be shut out of competitions in favour of the empty twilight endeavours of the likes of Tarantino and, more so, Scorsese.My biggest takeaway from this garbage is that I have to get Anna Netrebko's album of Verdi arias!",Knives Out

Let's get this out of the way and let me make clear that the only good parts of the franchise-according to me-are the original trilogy with Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. So I presume that the lowest ratings here were from the SW fan community. ""Knives out"" turns out to be a mix of ""The Royal Tannenbaums"" and ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". Just like Meghan Markle who's in for a lifetime of unnecessary comparisons with Diana, you'll inevitably-if subconsciously- compare Craig to David Suchet. Here we have a rich patriarch in his mansion cramped full with all sorts of exotic paraphernalia; a dysfunctional family, each with his own motif to do away with Dad. He is brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Plummer, determined and clear-minded even in the face of his own demise. The only one who seems to genuinely care for him is his immigrant nurse Marta Cabrera, and after the will is read, it turns into a witch-hunt against the unexpected beneficiary of Harlan's fortune. There are delightful details, like the ornamental assemblage of knives in the background of the chair in which members of the family are seated during the questioning. There's Benoit Blanc , a dapper detective on his own quest for the culprit. He's played by Daniel Craig who clearly enjoys showing us his capability for comedy and something beyond James Bond. Cabrera's inability to tell a lie without throwing up is at once brilliant and cliche, but her overall performance shines throughout the whole film-not that she lacks in serious adversaries, like the larger-than-life Jamie Lee Curtis, a charismatic businesswoman who proudly exclaims she ""built her business from the ground up"", which her son Ransom (a handsome and funny Chris Evans) dismisses as a million-dollar loan from Grandpa (a subtle nod to Trump). Harlan's attempt to discredit his flesh and blood as blood-sucking losers is also a challenge for the the viewer-albeit not a really difficult one, but that's not really the point here. The mystery is like a baklava, layered in parallel mysteries to be deciphered. Daniel Craig isn't David Suchet-but on the other hand-he doesn't attempt it anyway, and we can see that he did succeed to build an autonomous, authentic persona, admittedly with a much more pronounced inclination to humor. Which is definitely a good thing. The perfect example of this is a scene where he informs Ransom that his ""ancestral"" family home was in reality purchased by Grandpa in the 1980s. ""Knives Out"" is definitely value for money, whatever the haters say. Let's hope more directors will tap into whodunnits.

574,Bad-Good-Great,Copycatting shamelessly from many other similar movies,1,29 November 2019,"First of all, this so-called ""Knives Out"" might just be a goofy remake of ""Gosford Park (2001)"", even all the characters were almost alike. But the 2001 movie is more original, this 2019 one is so mediocre and generic. From 2001 to 2019, there are so many movies, screenplays, scenarios and plots that the screenplay writer(s) could borrow, steal and copycat into their ""Knives Out"" script. So~~~
The big magnetic disk of knives was copycatted from GOT's throne. The boring, formulaic and deadbeat humorless dialog, the storyline, the scenarios and the plot were heavily copycatted from those BBC's ""Masterpiece"" and ""Mysteries"" dramas, most were written, scripted and adapted from a bunch British housewives kitchen writers with poor logic and reasoning. Then,
The two police detectives were extremely poor cast, one clown, the other one, a greenhorn. They didn't look and act like seasoned plain-clothe detectives. There's no way these two guys could even be qualified as entry-level uniformed patrol cop, albeit for being senior plain-clothe detectives. It's a joke and insult to the police system.
Daniel Craig's role in this movie is the biggest joke, totally unnecessary, albeit another wrong cast, but since the screenplay writer(s) of this heavily copycatted movie needed to harvest all the roles of those existing movies and their existing screenplays so readily available to them when they wrote their script for ""Knives Out"", they simply could not include those obvious, already-there free chows, so they just copied everything available and threw into their mix.
Another character borrowed and capycatted from those typical BBC British detective crap, so-called DCI, detective inspector or some other titles.
When two American detectives investigated a suspicious murder case and questioned all the family members one by one, you think a civilian P.I. would be allowed to sit nearby those two low I.Q. American police detectives? And what's the purpose of asking him to speak with a southern accent?
All the family members in this farce were like cartoon's caricatures with dramatic exaggerated acting, talking, facial expressions, gestures....none of them looked natural and realistic enough, just gave a strong impression that they were trying very hard to mimic those characters in BBC's ""Mysteries"" and ""Masterpiece"".

From the very start the movie is able to captivate you, being one of the few movies of 2019 that truly fully captured my attention, as you wait to see how the mystery unfolds all leading to a shocking twist which by itself is enough to the see the movie for. And the characters are all bought to life with each actor/actress able to fully bring out all the specific characteristics of each person that makes them so fun to watch at. This is truly one of the better movies of 2019 and something that everyone should watch (even if murder mysteries aren't your particular brand of donut).",Knives Out
582,Otuoacheampong97,Far too Straight foward Mystery,7,20 February 2020,"Knives Out is an exciting English family mystery film realesed in 2019. The film's cast include the prominent talented actor Daniel Craig who stars as detective Benoit Blanc. And John Evans as Ransom, the black sheep of a wealthy, self centered, typical American family.
The film depicts a inward bitterness and buried differences among family members but who outwardly try to impress the head of their family head Harlan Thrombey, a respectable novelist and publisher. Martha, an immigrant, is a house maid and a help to this family head, who loves her more than he loves his own blood. But to be honest, the reason for such love to me was as mystery as the film itself. On the night of his 85th birthday, Martha mistakenly gave a wrong dose of medication to him. This triggered the creative, artistic brain of the novelist. He came up with a well worked perfect plan to save his help and friend from a likely murder charge and potential jail. But nothing is too perfect in this world. Who can connect the dots and literally find the tiny hole within this well worked perfect plan? Would it be detective Benoit Blanc?
The film is set in a morden day American society where there is pride in been a succesfull enterprenuer. The inclusion of Martha's origin and eventual procedings shows how humility and hardworking pays, irrespective of who you are. A perfection of the film's storyline reveals creativity and genius in screenplay; though with most of the scenes been straight forward, with self revealing mysteries. Martha's performance was key to the success of the film, by her ability to match background or origin with character.
I strongly attest that this film would merit the extoils of fanatics for its lively entertaining mystery. And it is worth watching especially in this era of our time in which everything happening is of nothing but mystery.",Knives Out
583,Chance_Boudreaux19,Subverts expectations in the best way possible,9,25 November 2019,"Now, I'm not a fan of the Last Jedi but that's no reason to dislike Rian Johnson as a director. I think he is best suited to doing things that aren't part of a franchise but let him unleash his creativity, as he has proven previously with Looper and now with Knives Out. This movie was beautifully shot, very well acted, the script was great and on top of that it is also genuinely funny. All the actors are great in their roles and everyone gets to have at least one moment in which they can shine as their respective character. I was very surprised that I could not see where the movie was going to go at all. It truly does a murder mystery movie completely differently and I am glad that the trailers did not reveal any major plot pointsl. Compared to a movie called the Good Liar that I saw recently, which was also a movie with plenty of twists Knives Out is at least a league above it. Whilst the Good Liar's surprises felt weak and preposterous, the twists in Knives Out are great and constantly keep you guessing. I was totally engrossed throughout and I was not bored even for a minute of its running time and fully recommend it. I really hope Rian Johnson makes more original movies instead of the rumored Star Wars trilogy as he is a very good director and needs to stick to projects that let him showcase his talents appropriately.",Knives Out

585,keyope,An overlong episode of Columbo,5,20 January 2020,"I like a good murder mystery and Hollywood hasn't been making them since the 90's so I was looking forward to this based on the glowing reviews and the 8.1 rating on imdb. Unfortunately as murder mysteries go this one doesn't really have anything original to add. It's also quite boring. It started very slowly with loads of scenes of people sitting in rooms talking in long boring monologues. I love a good dialogue driven movie like The Social Network, Reservoir Dogs, A Few Good Men, Moneyball, The Lincoln Lawyer etc, but the dialogue in Knives Out is bland and full of pretentious waffle.
It finally got interesting in the last half hour, but the way the crime was solved was lazy. Daniel Craig calls the guilty party into a room and then explains exactly how the crime was committed despite the fact he hasn't really done much in the way of investigating. It's just lazy. It's meant to be clever, but I was expecting a further twist because I couldn't believe it would be this basic, but it is. Basically Daniel Craig chats to everyone for an hour or so then in classic Columbo style reveals he has all the answers and you're supposed to be blown away by how clever it all is. I wasn't. I'm giving it a 5/10 because at least it was something different coming out of Hollywood for a change. I'm fed up with reboots, superhero movies and big franchises so I'm happy that this was made. I just wish it was better.",Knives Out
586,TamPalm,More not-so-subtle agenda pushing from Hollywood,6,22 December 2019,"This movie is waaay overrated. It is not a murder-mystery; it's yet another vehicle for Hollyweird to subtly push its liberal agenda. ""Illegals are good; Americans are bad."" That's the lesson. The illegal immigrant, or rather the daughter of an illegal immigrant, is literally painted as a saint. I can't count the times she's called ""a good person."" On the other hand, the American characters are painted as greedy, shallow, dishonest, and pathetic. This, juxtaposed with the immigrant saint is literally incapable of dishonest as she supposedly gets physically ill if she tries to lie.The ""mystery"" part of the plot is solved almost halfway through. I thought it was clear then that that part of the story was secondary. It was obvious to me, with the way the writers went out of their way to inject political discussions especially about immigration, into random conversations, and readily mocked the apparent non-liberal characters. I can't believe more viewers didn't catch this.In modern Hollyweird, the proselytizing comes first now, the art is secondary or tertiary. It was clear to me that ""Knives Out"" was simply a vehicle for a political agenda to be pushed. I should have known it would be, with TDS-stricken Chris Evans involved. But what a shame, as I was honestly looking forward to a legitimate murder-mystery. In my opinion, ""Knives Out"" was not that. I left the theater feeling duped.",Knives Out
587,Bek204,I'm really surprised,9,25 December 2019,"Knives out is the perfect movie for those who love to watch a murder, mystery and thriller movie. Knives out is a movie that has many events that takes you here and there, takes you to the past and present, the movie breaks the boredom in a very simple, easy and clever way and that is of course thanks to the writers, directors and producers. The cast is absolutely amazing, i would not be surprised if Ana De Armas for example got nominated for an Oscar, she was amazing and she really really deserves it. Chris Evans was absolutely incredible he really impersonated a grimy and sleazy character and he convinced all of us how filthy his character was that i think many of us when we look at Chris Evans all we see is Captain America but after watching this movie we will see the filthy Ransom Drysdale. Really loved the music, the interior design and everything about the movie, really really loved the directing. First when you watch the movie you'll think that maybe his youngest son killed him or maybe his nurse (who is played by Ana De Armas) or maybe Ransom Drysdale (who is played by Chris Evans) but then when the scene where his nurse kills him by a mistake because she gave him the wrong medications comes on, we are all convinced and we think that thats it ,she killed him not anybody else. And that's why i loved the ending of the movie because i did not expect that coming (Ransom Drysdale is the one who made up this whole thing so he died (killed himself) all because of him). Knives out is for sure one of my favorite movies in 2019 and one of my favorite movies of all time, i really hope it gets nominated for many awards and specially the oscars and i wont be surprised if it does because it really deserves to be nominated for many awards.

A true ensemble, as no one steals the show and they compliment each other perfectly. That is though where we find the weakest link of the film. The characters are not very dynamic and do feel like plot pushers more than individuals in this world.

591,xmike-25541,Kinda good but Johnson lost his thoughts,6,8 June 2020,"Good one-timer movie with great potential, ruined by poor, usual and boring tools for revelations..Its good family comedy/drama crime story.. Some things and ideas were cliché , some were good and funny.
Certainly its not movie which you will return to every 2 3 4 months like ocean eleven or predator, but it has quality..
Im not the one who trashes Johnson for Last Jedi but i dont think he is some kind of genius either.. Knives Out is very good one-timer with incredible cast and with the most beautiful living thing on the Earth (Ana de Armas).
My problem with this movie is the cheesy , predictable and very usual choice of ending and picking the tools to create final revelation.
The hidden flashbacks are key and its sad (or stupid ?) to decide NOT to show them to audience because you as the viewer cant play along and decifer who is the killer or the bad guy..
The most and second (but the biggest) problem is second half of the story. It derails from solving the murder case and focuses on social drama regarding with money and greed..
I mean i was very saddened how Johnson decided to finish this movie bc it derailed from detective crime comedy/drama to very mediocre and usual stuff with good guy (de Armas) and bad guy (..?..)
Lastly , i blame Johnson to create very stupid and unnecessary political message by trying to say very liberal-ish ""Trump bad, illegal immigrants Good, common sense BAD , socialism Good ) . I mean, almost every movie by those very soft directors MUST annoy the half of audience and losing the touch with reality.",Knives Out
592,archiecm,I think I found a flaw.,7,3 January 2020,"I enjoyed the movie but was confused at the end. The vial labels are switched by Ransom. Somehow Marta realizes she's given the ""wrong med"" to Mr. Thrombey. Does she know this because she somehow knows about the label switch? No. She simply didn't look at the vial carefully? No. Nurses always look carefully. And even if she made a once in a lifetime wrong med injection it wouldn't be on the exact same night that Ransom had made his label switch caper. Detective Blanc says she knew because she could tell the slight difference in the viscosity of the liquids to be injected (there were two). That can't be because it turns out she actually did give the harmless med after all and not the morphine. If she knew the labels were wrong due to the viscosity then she would have given the proper dose of morphine regardless of what the label said and therefor not gone into a panic. So what made her think she'd given an overdose of morphine? Am I the only one stuck here? Did I yawn and miss a crucial line?",Knives Out
593,classicactresses,Very Overrated,2,27 June 2020,I can't believe Knives Out was such a big hit. It was so boring and just dragged on too long. There is not one likeable character in the entire movie. Daniel Craig has a laughable southern accent and Anna de Armas is pretty but she's a terrible actress.

His accent is as bad as, no even worse than Kevin Costner's in JFK.

596,gooseshaw,A great murder-mystery with fun characters and twists that keep you entertained.,8,1 April 2020,"To put it simple, if you like murder mysteries, you'll like this movie. It's fun, it's clever, and it's got some good twists in it, unlike The Last Jedi (2017). Rian Johnson, who also directed Brick (2005), a film I liked, has proven himself to be a good writer/director, who just happens to not like, care about, or understand Star Wars. But that's OK, because this movie makes up for it.At first I wasn't sure about Daniel Craig being cast as a classy dramatized private eye with a southern accent, but he did just fine - though I still think I would've liked the character better with a different actor, simply because I just can't see
Daniel Craig as anyone but a cold, emotionless British guy (a role he plays so well). Everyone else does a great job however. My only complaint would be that some of these characters were underutilized.I went into this movie expecting a kind of canned dinner party mystery set in an old mansion during a rain storm, à la Clue (1985), a personal favourite of mine. This did not turn out to be the case. But still, I was surprised at the film and enjoyed every minute, finding myself somewhat disappointed that it was ending so soon.So why only an 8? Probably because I think the film is somewhat lacking in style. There are some elements that push the movie into a comedic dramatized universe (which I liked). Examples include the silly accent done by Daniel Craig, or the strong and ridiculous personalities of some of the family members. These things are one of the reasons I really loved this movie. But it doesn't feel like it goes far enough. There isn't enough screen time for most of these characters to make this film as fun as it could have been. If the screen time of these characters must be so limited, then perhaps even stronger personalities would have filled in these gaps (if that makes any sense). Either way, the movie simply felt too tame, and too realistic. It needed to go all the way.I had the same problem with Brick interestingly enough. That movie takes place in a high school but the students are so unrealistic it's as if they'd been pulled straight from a clichéd 1940's noir film. I always thought that in order to top off the farce that Johnson was clearly going for, why not simply cast adult actors as the kids, and never address how ridiculous it in the movie. I would have loved to have seen someone like Jon Hamm play a 16 year old kid, and play him just as Joseph Gordon Levitt did in that movie.Regardless, Knives Out was well written, not very predictable in my opinion, but still allows the viewer to solve the mystery themselves if they pay close enough attention. It was well made and well acted. Perhaps it deserves more than an 8, but that's what I'm giving it for now.",Knives Out

600,NpMoviez,A very nice and entertaining whodunit,9,9 August 2020,"It was really great to see a lot of my favourite actors like Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and Daniel Craig in a single film, that too a whodunit, one of my favourite genres. . .
The first 30 minutes or so felt a little generically convoluted but it got better after that and was entertaining to watch till the end. There was a lot of intriguing suspense and everyone did feel like a suspect, and I got a little ""Murder on the Orient Express"" vibe. It's not even close to that on the whole, but the few minutes of tension was perhaps the best part of the film. The next thing I appreciated about the film is that it kinda dodges the familiar route of telling the story. Things get revealed in the middle, and it takes a little different kind of route and becomes kinda ""chase"" movie. It's actually about what a particular character is going through, throughout the movie, and the hurdles that the said character is going through. Speaking of which, I need to say that characterization was really good in this film. No two characters could be exchanged with the other.What holds the movie back is that it doesn't use any new tricks to reveal things. You'll realize that everything that they went for were quite familiar and while serving the movie its purpose, it doesn't form a long lasting impression inside our head. And, the ""gimmick"" used for the protagonist is absolutely whacky.It's a very nice film and a really good way of presenting a whodunit, if you can ignore the familiar tropes. Chris Evans, fresh out of the Steve Rogers role, gives a remarkable performance in a role of a character that's literally the opposite of what Steve Rogers is. I just got to see that Evans was a much better actor than I took him for. Craig is fantastic, but feels quite like James Bond lite. Others have done a good job for whatever they were given.

607,allstarrunner,My expectations were subverted,5,18 February 2020,"This is a really odd movie to review. On the one hand, I was on the edge of my seat the first half-ish of the movie - I was really into the plot and trying to ""figure out"" what the twist or payoff was going to be - only to find the second half to be mostly a disappointment. The main problem comes when it is revealed, half way into the movie, how/who the killer was and then the last half of the movie is just seeing the behind the scenes lead-up to that event and then the fallout.The reason it was disappointing to me was because in this genre of movie/storytelling there is always a moment of ""AH! it was so and so in the Library with the dagger"" and this movie doesn't have that, at all. Which is odd, since this is the genre Johnson went with. Which, i'm sure, was precisely the genre he wanted. It's just a weird mix of a murder mystery drama but without the ""guessing game"" payoff.It's like Rian went into this movie and said, ""I know what you expect from this genre, and so i'm going to play off of that and not give you what you expect from this movie, which will make it really fresh and different!""

There are some laugh out loud moments (the knife scene, for instance) and some rather emotional moments (the scene of the death). But it's not a great film either, which is okay. It's got its flaws and comes across rather by the numbers once you get the hang of the story and it's direction.Most of the actors in this film are obviously big names and they own their roles as the various family members and detectives. But while this film entertains with its many quirky twists and turns, it always feels like something is missing, the standard element that makes a good movie great. The story is unique and exciting but it also doesn't go the distance it could have gone. There were many parts I thought were predictable, although I have to admit that I didn't know what direction the film was going to go until it almost got there. Despite this, I think this film is worth the watch, an entertaining ride, but there are far more important and prevalent films that have been released in the last year.It doesn't take itself seriously and you shouldn't take it too seriously either.

1. As I said, the film doesn't stick to the formula genre film and takes a different route which works.

As far as Who Dunnit? movies go, it's pretty solid and deserves some credit for it's take on dark comedy and characters.

There are similarities, the house is a character unto itself, and it's filled with a bunch of wacky weirdos trying to solve a murder, but that's as far as it goes. It has great production design, a fantastic cast and a very funny script. I love a good dark comedy, like Clue, Death to Smoochy, or anything from the Coen Brothers. Daniel Craig has one of the best parts in the movie, but everyone steals the show in their own way. It's the kind of movie Rian Johnson should be directing, something original, quirky and fun to watch.

622,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A great and surprisingly funny murder mystery like no other,10,12 October 2019,"Probably the best film I have seen this year and one of the most memorable theatrical experiences I have ever had seeing it at its world premiere at TIFF. Thanks to the success of his previous studio film, The Last Jedi, Johnson gets to create a passion project that is so desperately needs to be seen in theatres.Johnson shows his love for the murder mystery genre but avoids falling into its predictable plot mechanics. The opening of Knives Out sets the table of what you would expect from this kind of premise on paper. The death of the celebrity author Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) brings in all the family members seeking the opportunity to selfishly claim his inheritance and the strange circumstances of his passing calls in private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to solve the case. But once most of the character archetypes are established within the first act, Johnson allows his originality as a filmmaker to take over. From they're the perspectives shift and the twists elevate the story in a direction that is refreshing and surprisingly really funny. The humor becomes unrelenting and infectious, as everyone in the theatre could not hold back the laughter, with Johnson playing on genre's tropes and being meta about it.Johnson lets each of the cast members have fun and stand apart from one another with each playing really dynamic and complex character he has written. Chris Evans just relishes in playing the ruthless and yet complex grandson Ransom and doesn't hold back on spitting insults to anyone including his own family members. Michael Shannon plays a role slightly less antagonistic and more pathetic as youngest son Walt who gets no respect from his family. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to be a force of charisma to watch as the eldest daughter Linda. Even smaller but no less significant roles like Noah Segan and Lakieth Stanfield are also worth calling out.While Daniel Craig may get top-billing in the poster, the movie completely rest on Ana De Armas to carry the story and serve as the audience's perspective into this world. As Harlan's nurse Marta, she shows how isolated and alone she feels with the rest of Thrombley family despite they pretend to have her best interest. But as the plot progresses, De Armas gets to show range including some unexpected comedic moments and becomes more of a pivotal role in the mystery.
Daniel Craig gives full commitment to his over-the-top character. Craig as Blanc gets some of the best and most hysterical lines as he spout bizarre and confusing analogies in a super-thick Southern accent. He strikes a good balance of intelligence and hysterical as a man who is very perceptive of people's intention but also being really exaggerated and ridiculous in a good way.Similar to what he did with the Star Wars franchise in the Last Jedi, Johnson brings in social political commentary into a very old and tired genre to make if feel relevant. In this case, he uses the Thrombey family dynamic to tackle issues on the wealth of the 1%, immigration and self-entitled privilege. In the opening interview, Harlan's adult kids and in-laws all say they believe that each of their successful careers come from hard work despite flashbacks reveal they leech off of Harlan's own self-earned wealth and celebrity name. And with Marta coming from an immigrant family and being Harlan's personal nurse, the Thrombey's keep acknowledging subtly and (unsubtly in a heated family argument about politics) her lower status in society to boost their ego even they think it comes from a sense of sympathy. The oblivious nature and lack of wokeness most of the family retains (particularly with Don Johnson's and Toni Collete's characters) shows how much they have been too sheltered in their own rich bubble that creates a lot of great satirical humour.Regardless if you liked or disliked The Last Jedi, are fan of Rian Johnson in general as a filmmaker or just love the murder-mysteries in film, Knives Out is a big crowd pleaser that uses its huge big name cast to full efficiency. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, it adds twists upon twists that don't dragged down the story but elevate. Once it comes out in nation-wide theatres, see it as soon as you can.",Knives Out
623,ChristianLeFeuvre,A fun whodunnit caper,8,12 February 2021,"If you like a good 'whodunnit', then you have to see 'Knives Out'. written and directed by Ryan Johnson.
'Knives Out' is an old fashioned murder mystery about the death of a patriarch of an extremely eccentric family. It has an amazing cast list including Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Daniel Craig, who plays an equally eccentric detective investigating, and the rest of the cast are the suspects. For me, this is easily one of the best cast lists for a film I have seen in a long time.
Murder mysteries are always extremely popular and, I have to say, it has been a long time since we have seen a decent one on the big screen. A couple of years ago we had the remake of 'Murder On The Orient Express', but as I said, it's been a long time since we had a decent 'whodunnit' in cinemas if you have read my review of 'Murder On The Orient Express you'll understand what I mean. It has also been a long time since we have had an original murder-mystery movie that hasn't been based on something else or just a remake but a brand new story and characters.
I was recommended this film and I have to say, I loved it. It is an ingenious film, extremely well written and full of brilliant characters and actors giving some of their best performances. It is Daniel Craig I have to focus on though. Wow, what a performance. This is so over-the-top it is fantastic. He has a ridiculously enhanced southern drawl accent, which critics and a lot of cinema-goers hated, but I thought it was hilarious in such a good way. When he first starts talking I was a bit wary of the accent and I wasn't sure if it was going to work, but after a few seconds, I realised it worked. I loved him in this, he owns this film for me. Critics have complained that he is 'hamming it up', but that is what is so good about Daniel Craig, he knows he is and it's so obvious he is having a good time doing it.
I have to say, the entire cast was just terrific and there is really only a couple of weak points in the film, but I'll get to those later. The script is really witty, clever and pits its characters against each other, conflicts the situations and raises the tension in almost every scene.
Ryan Johnson has done an amazing job here. 'Knives Out' is a comedy but with suspense. His direction is so good because he approached it knowing that he wants the audience to laugh when he wants them to laugh, but at the same time he didn't want to lose the tension and release the audience from the suspense when he knows they should be feeling the tension when he wants them to, and he got that perfect balance in just about every scene. He keeps his characters mysterious when it seems they are being their full selves in front of everyone.
I won't give any spoilers here, but this film has a really unique take on the 'whodunnit', in regards to what information it lets you know early on. It does give out a lot more than you would expect early on, especially for these types of movies, but that just makes you rethink how you process that information and that's what I liked, it has you second-guessing yourself throughout the film.
I don't have many 'niggles' with this movie apart from those 'weak points' I mentioned earlier. There is one character whom I just thought was unnecessary. He had one or two lines which weren't relevant, he was on his phone the whole time and he is the focus of a few of the jokes but he doesn't have the chance to develop the character really and for me, he was just there to be laughed at. OK, yes that happens a lot in films, but this film is so clever it just seemed a waste, a one-joke character. Also, I thought the scenes where the characters leave the house weren't as strong, they lost the claustrophobic feel and weren't as suspenseful, I'm not saying they were 'bad' scenes, they just weren't as good as the ones set inside the house.
'Knives Out' is exactly the film I was hoping it would be. The cast is amazing, the directing is brilliant and it's a fun movie to watch.",Knives Out

This is a movie worth watching several times! In fact, it reminded me of sitting in front of our brand new 1952 Philco black and white snowy, stripey first tv, watching a 40s ""The Butler Did It"" film. Complete with a New Orleans creepy mansion and a cast of devious and deceitful characters. And a convoluted, intricate plot. It had more twists and turns than a dog's hind leg. But for me, my favorite character was Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig. Who would have thought that he could nail a Southern accent? I am thinking that the setting was supposed to be New Orleans, complete with architecture and props. However, Daniel's accent was not quite a Nawlins accent. But close enough! I loved this film.

630,michaeldoud,First Hit: An enjoyable investigative romp with a group of very capable actors in an old fashion story.,8,10 December 2019,"First Hit: An enjoyable investigative romp with a group of very capable actors in an old fashion story.This film reminded me of an old fashion crime drama, sort of like a ""Clue"" game. What makes this movie work is the way these capable actors tell this tale of crime and deceit in both a comedic and dramatic way.Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) is an in-home nurse who has also befriended her only client, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Harlan is very wealthy from writing eighty successful mystery novels. His health is failing, hence the need for Marta. Marta has become his only true confidant because the rest of the family, except his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), totally lives off his generosity.Linda and her husband Richard (Don Johnson) live in Harlan's home and don't fully escape from Harlan's largeness because he funded Linda's successful real estate business. They have a son Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), who is arrogant, flippant, and smart while living off an allowance from Harlan.Harlan's home is large and his mother, Great Nana (K Callan) lives with him. She doesn't talk and sits in a wheelchair throughout the film but plays an important role in the story. Other family members who are living off Harlan's wealth and success include; Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), his wife Donna (Riki Lindhome) who run Harlan's publishing company. Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) who is Harlan's deceased son Neil's wife, and their daughter Meg (Katherine Langford), who receive an allowance from Harlan for Meg's schooling. Each of them are taking advantage of Harlan and during the film's story, each of these ways are explored more fully.The family has gathered to celebrate Harlan's 85th birthday. During this party, most of the family, we learn, have discussions with Harlan about his largeness towards them.The next morning, after the party, the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds Harlan dead in his study with his throat slit, it appears to be a suicide.However, someone has anonymously hired Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) a famous southern investigator to find out if it was murder or suicide. Blanc, working with the police, begin to unravel the mystery as to why Blanc was hired to be involved.The police are convinced it was suicide, but the extraordinary questioning skills of Blanc and his inquisitive mind of solving puzzles begins to shed a different light on Harlan's death. Slowly, and methodically, his interviews begin to piece a different story together.One of the funnier parts of the interviewing process by Blanc, we learn that Marta cannot lie. If she lies, she throws up. There are a couple hilarious, slightly gross, scenes of this.When the lawyer comes and the Will is read, everyone gathers to find out that Harlan has left everything, I mean everything, to Marta. The family doesn't know what to do, or how they will survive, or do they?Craig is hilariously fantastic as the investigator Benoit Blanc. His slow southern drawl and idiosyncrasies, during the interviews using the piano, are spot on funny and pointed. Evans is perfect as the conniving Ransom. His ability to be both charming and evil are perfect. Armas is sublime as Marta. Her expressions of the fear of doing something wrong, her caution because having a mother who is illegally in the country, and also wanting to do the right thing for Harlan are excellent. Curtis is outstanding as the daughter who wants more. Shannon is terrific as the son who thinks he's in charge of Harlan's business but really is just a pawn. Collette is perfectly flighty and conniving as the social influencer and thief in the name of her daughter Meg. The rest of the cast is equally good in making this a wonderful romp. Rian Johnson wrote and directed this fun filled mystery and got the best out of everyone for their roles.Overall: This was a perfect, fun filled, and enjoyable movie to sit through.",Knives Out

638,paulmcuomo,"Easy one of the best films of the year, with plenty of rewatch value",10,27 November 2019,"I saw this film today, and left wishing to see it again in the cinema - a thoroughly enjoyable affair, with a whodunnit with more twists and turns than the Nürburgring.Rian Johnson, who's a filmmaker I've always enjoyed - especially when he can operate without the handcuffs of a franchise such as Star Wars, which is easily the most stifled film to date - and has a habit of writing and directing films that don't quite fit a mold. Brick is a Neo-Noir in theory, but is also not, and Looper is a Sci-Fi that often isn't. Knives Out is a Mystery, but it's predominantly a character study and comedy, particularly with Harlem (Christopher Plummer) and Marta (Ana De Armas).Easily the two best aspects to this story are the contempory nature setting of modern day to contrast with the old school mystery elements similar to Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle stories to help make the story funny, and also the acting.
Quickly on the film's structure and editing, Johnson does manage to do several moments of misdirection; we are shown the truth vey early in the film, as with several people's recounting stories to the police, but the way that the story twists this is something that I think can be taught in Film School as setting precedents and placing details that people might not notice like a phrase, or a question that gets answered later in an organic way. It probably won't get acknowledged by the Oscars in either the screenwriting or editing departments, but it should be.Acting wise, this film is loaded, but the four main standouts are Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas, and Christopher Plummer.Daniel Craig, who in the vain of Logan Lucky, gets to do something a bit more funny and different than the James Bond films, and it's clear he really enjoys playing this Kentucky version of Sherlock Holmes, who is simultaneously believable as a sleuth - for he does uncover the whole truth - but is also able to make it not seem like a revelation.Chris Evans, similarly, gets to play a character who is the exact opposite of what he does as Captain America, where plays, essentially, a total tool. However, he's a total tool who still carries himself with a degree of charisma and who is watchable and identifiable - even if its the worst parts of him we're identifying with.Ana De Armas and Christopher Plummer respectively play Marta Cabrera and Harlan Thrombley, and are both the heart of the film. Marta is exceptionally likable, and clearly is representative of similar traits of Harlan - both are people who built their success from the ground up, with Harlan being a self-made millionaire crime writer, and Marta being a daughter of immigrants who works as a nurse. Marta is essentially the main character, and also the only one played by someone unfamiliar to Western audiences, as this enhances her appeal as a hard working person, and likewise Plummer plays Harlan like a man who cares for everybody around him and goes out of his way to help them, but is also firm when he needs. Both Plummer and De Armas could've played these roles as ""throwaways"", but both of them ensure that we're rooting for both of them until the end. Fantastic work by them both.I loved every part of this film, and I may even see it a few more times in theatres - I recommend you do too.",Knives Out

Others, such as Jamie Lee Curtis, were totally underused.

It concerns a world renowned eccentric best-selling mystery-crime novelist Harlan Thrombey, marvelously played by the great Christopher Plummer, who is found dead with a slit throat and the knife still in his hand at his massive estate after his 85th birthday, was it a suicide? There in lays the tale. A debonair Southern detective with an oversized ego named Benoit Blanc, sensationally played by the charismatic Daniel Craig in a scene-stealing Golden Globe Award nominated for Best Actor, is determined to follow up on his colleague police Lieutenant Eliot's theory that Harlan's death with a suicide, because he believes otherwise.

Special kudos to the beautiful Ana de Armas for her endearing and wonderful Golden Globe Award nominated turn for Best Actress as Harlan's loyal house nurse Marta Cabrera. Indeed everyone has something to hide, but which one of them is the murderer? Brilliant direction by Johnson who also wrote the clever and captivating Oscar nominated original screenplay.

650,kikoydaba3,a whodunit for our times,10,6 December 2019,"Stellar performances from an ensemble cast with insane on-screen chemistry, great direction, and a whodunit for our times, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is one of 2019's best with some wholly relevant story about family and politics.Boasting a talented cast, it goes without saying Knives Out wouldn't be a spectacular triumph if not for the three leads of Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. Evans, playing Hugh ""Ransom"" Drysdale, is a ridiculous mixture of unlikable and smoothness. Craig, playing Benoit Blanc, is hilarious as a detective with a thick southern accent. Armas, playing Marta Cabrera, grounds the film through her warmhearted portrayal of Marta's honest, firm, and ultimately good character. The rest of the cast do not disappoint and give dynamite performances of the fewer screen time they receive which includes Christopher Plummer, and Jamie Lee Curtis, to name a few.Central to Knives Out is the death of the family's patriarch, Harlan Thrombey, but the film is truly about a dysfunctional family and a satire about wealth and inheritance. Though Knives Out seemingly reveals Harlan's killer even before the finale, the writing uses the early reveal as a springboard for exploring the family dynamics between the Thrombeys and Marta, showing how each of the Thrombeys are inherently selfish despite their good front. When the will reading shockingly reveals that Harlan left his entire possessions to Marta, the Thrombeys immediately turn on her, except Ransom, and their true attitude is revealed by calling her names and making unfounded accusations of unduly influencing Harlan's will. This is exemplified by previous dialogues hinting that Marta is a mere afterthought to the family such as when individual Thrombeys claim they wanted her to be present at the funeral but were outvoted and not knowing her true country of origin. Through the whirlwind of losing not only an employer but a close friend and family by choice, Marta grows from a demure and devoted nurse to the strong and caring heir of Harlan's possessions.Knives Out isn't the traditional whodunit were the identity of the murderer is clear only in the end. Multiple faints, clues, and surprises makes Knives Out unique in the genre by seemingly throwing out the central mystery, when in actuality each scene is made for characters to grow. The journey, and the not the end, is basically the film's overarching thought. The complexity of the script requires repeat viewings because the hefty themes and minute character is buried underneath the murder mystery. When the ending reveals that Harlan caused his own death, though instigated by Ransom, that moment gives better clarity to the family dynamics explored by the film. People feel entitled to inheritance and will do anything to claim them.Rian Johnson is at home in Knives Out. Everything about the direction is firing on all cylinders. The film shifts from recollection to plot progression seamlessly. Not a second is wasted or feel dragging. Setting the film in a mansion evoking old money adds visual representation to the themes. The cinematography and music are also topnotch.Not only is Ana de Armas insanely beautiful, but talented as well. Hoping to see her in bigger and better roles. Lastly, give us more of Daniel Craig southern accent roles!10/10",Knives Out

It reminds me a great deal of the movie Clue, which I absolutely love. The acting is great. Daniel Craig has a lot of range in his acting abilities. The story line is fun. Basically, the patriarch of the family dies under somewhat mysterious circumstances, and it becomes a mystery as to was he killed or did he kill himself. But, there is a twist that may be slightly predictable. Who cares though? The set is fantastic, the dialogue is great, and the storyline is entertaining. If you are looking for a jump scare or flat out mystery, then it's not the movie for you.",Knives Out
653,insatiableaskeri,Fantastic plot with impeccable characters,10,2 October 2021,"It occurred to me that I'd never taken Craig's acting seriously... until I watched this flick:)
In addition, Anna de Armas was a pretty chick with baby face. However, in this movie they unraveled their hidden potential. Daniel Craig proved to be versatile and even hilarious actor who is capable of portraying diverse characters. Also, De Armas demonstrated an exceptional performance, having showed a huge variety of emotions.The cast generally was flawless: all the A-list actors in one movie! The plot was immaculate with unequivocally intense pacing and breathtakingly unexpected twists.Yearning for the sequel! Sensational job!",Knives Out

I hoped there would be something more, something to grab on to, something to be impressed by, but the final moments of the movie fell flat. While Chris Evans (Ransom Drysdale) brings charm and personality to the character and Ana de Armas (Marta Cabrera) stole the show, Daniel Craig's (Benoit Blanc) southern accent was painful. The movie attempts to create a great plot, to keep you guessing till the end and then deliver with a bang, but you lose interest halfway. While we all love a good mystery, this isn't it.",Knives Out

That is the problem with this movie. All the famous actor have nothing to do and their part are very small. The so called murder you figured it out in less then 10 minutes. And Craig accent sucks badly. It's very hard to listen to him. I could not wait for this movie to end I was ready to leave after 10 minutes into it. Wow boring.,Knives Out

People like Chris Stuckmann, Jared Buckendahl, LC Screen Talk, And myself will actually look at this movie through the lens of actual analysis from a filmmmaking perspective, unlike that hack Jeremy Jahns. This is one of my favorite movies of the year and don't let dumb salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy The Dictator Tell you differently.This is a witty script from Rian Johnson, with well thought out characters.

What you need is to distinguish between the true and false."" Today, with the decline of inferential novels, Agatha Christina and her readers still create such wonderful stories for us. Just as the film title is different from general reasoning films, the screenwriter used Marta's narrative in the first half of the film to let us stand in the perspective of God to watch the progress of this story and this human drama. But the truth we think is only what we are willing to believe. The screenwriter has brought all the audience into his narrative trap. That is, what we think is not the true truth. The story of the movie is ups and downs, and it gives me a long-lost feeling that is completely like reading an inferential novel! And after perfectly telling this story, it still satirizes the most fragile and dark thing of humanity, the bug in the first half In the end, the self-consistent and echoing of the story should be the most injured marta, she had a chance to save halan. '' Drysdale's family, the evil house of the ""Deformed House"", is the real family of halan. They only care about themselves and abandon their love.

660,milleymeister,disappointing,7,31 August 2020,I think i prefer Daniel Craig as beefcake James Bond.I hate these massive Hollywood ensemble movies. IT reminds me of remakes of Murder on the Orient Express. Underperformed written and acted. Are we supposed to give extra credit for the shear weight of Hollywood salary?The only good part was the scene where Craig reveals all. And it was a good twist. But the rest of it didn't lead there.,Knives Out

A detective mystery till the very end, with a few twist along the way, paced skillfully to hold your attention but also keep you wondering for more. A weird (and perhaps miscast) detective hired to find the killer in your, probably, typical rich family. Good acting, few laughs along the way and a touching story of true friendship in a world that revolves around money.

Because I don't get Star Wars either. I guess it was awesome in the 80's but the one I watch recently was as disjointed as this. And wtf accent is Daniel Craig absolutely failing at. Is he trying to be funny, over the top, or is he seriously acting a part? For me this is a mess, so obviously I must stick to Star Wars because I have no idea what I watched here. It wasn't funny, dramatic, or mysterious. By the end I didn't really care who, or if anyone killed him, I was just wishing someone would kill me.5 Stars, I love me some Ana, she is awesome in everything she's in.

Country side house, where this film was taken is a really good location with its surroundings adding value to it.

667,simonpcpearson,An honest review,3,5 December 2019,"The shills are out in force for this , frankly forgettable, movie. There seems to be a constant stream of 10/10 reviews which read as though the poster hasn't even seen the film.
The film looks good but the plot and character motivations don't make much sense in the face of anything other than casual scrutiny.
That said I did enjoy the first act. If the rest of the film had continued in that tone it would have undoubtedly earned a higher score for me.
The second act is very pedestrian and drags,but the film falls apart in the denouement.
Has zero rewatch potential. Wait for it on TV or streaming.",Knives Out

669,jakebirkel,Agatha Christie Meets Clue: A Perfect Mix,10,2 December 2019,"Rian Johnson's Knives Out takes cliches from murder mysteries and utilizes them to new effect. It's intricate, funny, and unexpectedly fast-paced while utilizing a hardworking all-star cast.Rian Johnson: I'm one of those people that really loved The Last Jedi, so there were certain expectations for me going into this movie. Needless to say, Rian Johnson shattered those expectations. He wrote a complex yet good-natured murder mystery, giving you the clues throughout the story before pulling the rug out from under you. I know that expression is extremely overused, but it's really what happens. He set up expectations for what this movie was supposed to be and crafts it to be something completely different. It's Agatha Christie meets Clue meets Crime and Punishment and I love every gut-busting second of it. The best part is that on a second viewing, every single thing has a different meaning; and every second meaning promotes dual characteristics.The Cast: Every single member leans into their characters with enthusiasm and fully commits to the roles. Daniel Craig is wonderful as the lead detective, constantly on the line between parody and real-life Sherlock Holmes. Chris Evans plays directly against his Captain America, clearly having the time of his life with it. Jamie Lee Curtis plays ruthless like no other, constantly protective yet always on offense. Michael Shannon plays a little bit into his type but ultimately shines through; he flexes his range, going from improv king to terrifying in an instantly smooth transition. Toni Colette plays comedy like no other; she somehow appropriately and sympathetically plays a spoiled rich person. Everyone else in the cast melds together perfectly. The standout of standouts is Ana de Armas. She blends drama and comedy deftly, taking her character on a wonderfully original journey. She sells every second of it.",Knives Out
670,trolliyama,"Dear Lord, this movie is obnoxious",2,28 July 2020,"I usually hate movies that treat viewers like morons, and this movie is pretty insulting in that aspect.The ""quirky"" detective played by Daniel Craig was the worst part of it, I swear this movie would have been one million times better if he had died. Preferably in a rather undignified, anti-climatic manner.I honestly think people was so happy for finally having the chance of seeing a Hollywood film that wasn't a remake, sequel, reboot, or part of a franchise that they
didn't mind very much the film in question being total garbage.This movie won't survive the test of time, and it will become one of those movies that were beloved at their time, but completely forgotten shortly after.",Knives Out
671,thetyvonlesure,An All-Star Ensemble Whodunnit,7,8 December 2019,"Knives Out is one of 2019's brightest original concept. It is a charming take on the Mystery genre. Knives Out is written and directed by Rian Johnson, and it portrays an All-Star cast of characters as a family fighting for inheritance in leu of a tragedy. The film stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and Christopher Plumber as the Thrombey Family. Despite being centered around the Thrombey family and their tragedy, the film's protagonist is Marta portrayed by Ana De Armas. The best performance in the film comes from Daniel Craig's portrayal of Detective Benoit Blanc. Craig does an exceptional portraying a southern detective. His southern accent and intense body language present the film with a sense of levity. Most of the cast (with an exception of a few) have great chemistry and they make the film superb. The best part of this film is the acting, whereas the worst part comes from the writing.Rian Johnson wrote the film and for the most part, his writing was not bad. However, in typical Rian Johnson fashion, his writing is very incohesive and inconsistent. The first half of this film serves as a daunting mystery with thrilling dialogue. The setup is incredible and is some of the best writing in 2019. Midway into the second act, the film loses its footing and becomes a family comedy. The first half of the film is squandered by a premature reveal that ultimately hurts the story. Essentially, the Knives Out story has no rhythm or flow. This lack of cohesion trickles down into the characters as well. Daniel Craig's Detective Benoit Blanc goes from the World's Smartest Detective to the World's Most Oblivious Private Eye. Furthermore, Characters such as Trooper Wagner (played by Noah Segan) water down the film with corny one liners of obscure or outdated Pop Culture references. The comedy in this film fluctuates from natural to corny. The conclusion of the film is unsatisfying as well, because it feels more like a reach than an actually well-thought out ending. The conclusion is borderline parody, because it makes no sense for the most part how the characters came to find out the nature of the true mystery. There are minor hints throughout the film, however using things such as Hallmark movies as a clue is very stupid. The writing was very incohesive and could have benefitted from more guidance.Despite the poor writing, the film is thematically sound. The sociopolitical undertones of the film are well done. However, the dialogue toward immigration fluctuates between respectful and ignorant. The cinematography was great. The film was well-lit and finely produced. The digital cameras were great for this film. The set piece of Harlan Thrombey's estate was really intricate. The estate is great to look at, and it's akin to the estate in 1958's ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". The audio quality and editing were fine. The compilation of flashbacks was refreshing.Overall, Knives Out is one of 2019's best original story that was squandered by Rian Johnson's poor writing and corny humor. The film excels in acting and thematic storytelling, serving as a decent film with some of 2019's best casting.",Knives Out
672,richardkiddle,Moderately entertaining,6,26 April 2020,"I watched this due to the starry cast & Agatha Christie elements. It's a shame that many of the actors are given little to do with barely fleshed out characters..Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis are all given short shrift. There's no great suspense or mystery and for me the solution was a bit dull. It was a nice movie to look at & had some funny moments..but not that gripping.",Knives Out

I was looking forward to it but unfortunately it's just boring and dull. You'll find more charisma and excitement in a daytime soap. Ana de Armas is the only actor worth watching, while the film exposes the limitations of Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this.",Knives Out
674,politicidal,Effortlessly entertaining ensemble mystery movie!,8,19 December 2019,"Rian Johnson pays tribute to the classic murder-mysteries of old ranging from Agatha Christie to Columbo. Since this movie is still newly arrived in theaters, I'll stave from spoiling the movie.I'll say this, the movie wraps a 7/10 mystery up with a 8/10 cast and 9/10 direction from Rian Johnson who keeps it all balanced out well and good. Daniel Craig is very good as the colorful detective Benoit Blanc and Ana De Armas is excellent as the de facto protagaonist out of an impressive ensemble. Shout out to Chris Evan who's clearly having fun with his part.The movie has a good sense of pacing to let the mystery unravel piece by piece.

Daniel Craig of course is excellent as was each Actor of this movie, they play their parts to near perfection. The writers were even able To insert a dialogue on a sensitive political issue and they did so with some small humor and by showing both sides of the argument good for them.The story was excellent it was a throwback to the old fashion mysteries of the 50s and 60s and I loved every second of it and didn't want it to end. I hope and hope Daniel Craig will bring that character back for a follow up movie because in today's environment we sure could use it.The movie was an excellent mix of humor, mystery, thriller, and family drama. The plot had you guessing all the way to the end, it was very smart. So please give us another one, my hope Is Daniel Craig's character will turn into a series of movies much like the beloved Thin Man series.",Knives Out

Kudos to the writer(s) who created this high-class drama full of interesting characters. Knives Out displays Riveting Acting from the All-Star Cast. Jaime Lee Curtis is as always in top form. All did AWESOME. Even the supporting stars shine. An Ensemble like this is not easy to find at all. Yet, you will see major Hollywood names here doing their craft superbly. To me, this movie should win Oscar(s). In short, Knives Out did not disappoint me. I bet you will like it too. I just tell you one thing: pay attention to every detail and listen the dialogues and exchanges between the characters. There are clues in there, though the writers threw some curves aiming at confusing you in a good way. You have to watch and think, mi amigo(a). For example, this line: ""You did this.""

This movie decides to be a satire for the first 30mins, a silly comedy for the next 90mins and throws in some Thriller minutes for the fun of it, like playing Cluedo with Go-Stones, its a mess ad all over the place!This murder mystery ""reveals who the killer is"" halfway through the movie and still keeps on going, because it changes its premise after the first half, and now decides to be a different movie.All that being said... this movie is entertaining, for over 2 hours and reminds me how funny Daniel Craig can be. While the movie still suffers from the typical ensemble cast problems, it almost satirically plays with its own flaws and doesn't take itself to seriously.It's absolutely not a movie that you will remember in a few months, but its a light-harded comedy that will make you laugh a few times and that's what a comedy is about after all.I'm not sure if this is a movie you have to experience in the cinema, but it will be the perfect movie for a lazy rainy Sunday once it hits the streaming services!",Knives Out

708,adamk-2,Passes The Time,6,17 October 2019,"""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way.",Knives Out
709,tomarm-21596,"Overrated, illogical, more exhausting than fun",5,21 September 2021,"Murder mysteries break down when there's ""But that doesn't make any sense"" moments, and this movie is nothing if not a series of those. No idea what (the usually fantastic) Daniel Craig is trying to do here, but the result is an irritating, cartoonish, mess. The nominal protagonist exists more as a symbol of a politically correct virtuous Latina rather than a real character you'd find interesting or care about. Movie seems to see itself as farcical fun - a seeming acknowledgement of its lack of logic - but it's really more disjointed and exhausting.",Knives Out

And what fun for us viewers. It's always good news a film takes 2 hours and feels shorter watching it.
Ana de Armas - now meeting Daniel Craig as add-kicking bond girl, has a lot on her shoulders, playing the vulnerable nurse around whom hateful family member circle as ever so many vultures and lights up the scenes. More action heroes on holiday here: Chris Evans shows he is a character actor, effectively playing the nasty guy. I enjoyed Toni Collette as the hysteric one and Jamie Lee Curtis as Mrs. cool and collected. And what about Don Johnson as a clueless dad...
I've read about all Christie's work and so many elements are elegantly used. The mansion, the racketeers, the twisted family histories, even BBC 80's style the title role lettering... it's all there to enjoy
I'm not totally convinced of Daniel Craig's southern US accent - but the more the movie develops, the more he becomes a credible mix of Columbo and Hercule Poirot. Great timeless music score too.",Knives Out

Rian Johnson produced something exceptional in the world of remakes and adaptations, It reminds me off the old school cult films with all the mysteries and puzzles to put together to solve a murder case.
I would say, brilliant filmmaking, a feast for the classic cine lovers.Though it is an original film, it draws some parallels to the 1964 released Hollywood film ""Woman of Straw"" starring Sir Sean Connery.
Knives Out is a lavish and more complex version of that film with the characters swapped but the idea's remained identical to the ""Woman of Straw"".All the actors are superfit in their respective roles, especially Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, and Ana de Armas.
I won't get into details in this review as the film is a mystery and you have to solve it on your own, otherwise, it would be a disrespect to the creativity and hard work of all the actors who acted in this film.Knives Out is a mystery, which you should explore through Monitor's screens or LED's.

Sure, there are some hard to believe things, but it's a movie, people! The character who throws up is not believable, but it's not done in a gross out manner, if that worries you.The one thing that I admit I couldn't get past was Daniel Craig doing that strong Southern accent. They should have either changed the accent or changed the actor. Craig was fine, but he's just the wrong person to be given that accent to play, and I found it distracting. Imagine Tom Cruise doing a strong Cockney accent in a movie, especially when everyone else in it spoke normally. Distracting, wrong person, wrong accent!This movie is not particularly funny, but it's light and enjoyable. Hollywood should make more movies like this, without gratuitous language and sex, but with an entertaining plot and not a lot of ""messages"".I totally disagree with anyone who found this political. I hate ""sucker punches"" in movies, where disdain is shown for one side, especially when you aren't expecting it. I didn't think that happened here, and I am Conservative. Shots were taken at the extreme right and the extreme left, the legal status of mother was just part of the story without taking a side, and was only used to motivate the nurse to comply.",Knives Out
723,kaneeddy,A very fun whodunit,8,23 November 2019,"I had a fun time unravelling the mystery of Knives out, it takes so many twists and turns and executes the whole whodunit formula really well. The cast is fantastic every character in the film have very distinct personality traits that stick out and they are all played really well, Ana De Armas does a great job of being a protagonist that balances out all the exotic personalities these characters have. If one person stuck out the most in the film it was definitely Daniel Craig, the accent he puts on is fantastic while not exactly an accurate southern accent it is used in a way where its supposed to be exaggerated adding to the fun nature of the film. The writing is pretty great with the twists and turns blindsiding you at times making it more and more intriguing as the mystery slowly unravels.While I say the writing for the most part is great it has certain moments and sequences in the film that go for too long which can sometimes make you slightly bored and draw your attention away from the movie, it is quick however to getting you back to being engrossed in the mystery, if these sequences were slightly shorter and more concise it would benefit the film to me.While not perfect Knives out is a movie I had fun with and would be a whodunit I would recommend you watch especially if you're a fan of the genre or of the films fantastic cast members, 2019 is an excellent year for film and this just adds to that list.",Knives Out

734,TheOvereducated,Smart and fun mystery film :),9,30 December 2019,"A smart and fun ""Who done it?"" mystery movie, which I watched twice!First of all, I was impressed by Daniel Craig's performance! His role was charming and fun and something like a modern, American version of detective Poirot (Agatha Christie). It's noteworthy, that I was not much of a fan of him before, 'cause I didn't like his first 3 James Bond movies. Yet, after this film I ask myself, whether the directors and screenwriters of those films are primarily responsible for this.Additionally, Chris Evans played a jerk - something totally different to Captain America - charmingly (!). Jamie Lee-Curtis and most of the other actors were great additions to the movie too. The one that unfortunately didn't impress me was de Armas. I could easily see another female actor playing that role better. Her performance started well, but was ultimately flat... thank God for her looks!Lastly, the writer/director R. Johnson earned back my attention. I was negative towards his films, because neither ""Looper"" nor ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" I found any good, yet, now I'll be checking out his future films with way less prejudice :)",Knives Out

Actors are all great in their roles , although most are barely on screen and that's a shame with such a great cast . But it flows very well and things find a way to make the audience react at the right moments , this is due to some nicely directed moments and some perfectly read dialogue. I would have loved this film and given it a much higher score if it just had a little something more . If the twist wasn't so damn noticable to the point of making you say 'it can't be that because it's to obvious' . If there was just a tad more meat on its bones.

739,chasemykleby,Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece.,9,28 November 2019,"""Knives Out"" Review
(9/10)KNIVES OUT LEADS VIEWERS ON A THRILLING AND WICKEDLY FUN RIDE AS THE ENTIRE ENSEMBLE OFFERS BREATHTAKING PERFORMANCES IN THIS WHODUNNIT MYSTERY.
Though Rian Johnson is now perhaps best known for having directed Star Wars: The Last Jedi, across all his films, Johnson incorporates story elements that subvert expectations, delivering twists viewers won't see coming. That's all to say, Knives Out fits perfectly within his wheelhouse as a modern murder mystery whodunnit thriller. Written, directed and produced by Johnson, the filmmaker also surrounds himself with an astonishingly talented ensemble cast, who execute his vision with masterful precision.
Johnson's particular talent of keeping audiences on their toes is on full display with Knives Out, which follows a fairly standard formula for murder mystery movies - in that the viewers are shown little bits about the night of the murder as the mystery is slowly unraveled on screen. The filmmaker uses a deft hand in both setting up and pulling off the twists in Knives Out, laying the foundation for them long before viewers even see them coming. Astute audiences, especially those that revel in solving a murder mystery plot before the characters on screen, will pick up on the clues, but Johnson uses their expectations against them to keep even those viewers guessing.
In a film with plenty of colorful characters, Craig's Blanc is an energetic scene-stealer, even as de Armas' Marta is presented more as the film's protagonist. The actress and her more understated performance work well to make Marta the most grounded character in Knives Out, contrasting well against the more campy, over-the-top members of the Thrombey family. Collette's Joni is another scene-stealer, dropping a surprising number of one-liners, as Curtis's Linda is a more imposing woman - though her performance is just as fun.
Every aspect of Knives Out - from Johnson's directing and Craig's southern drawl to the satisfyingly chilling score and intricately detailed set design - comes together to form this lush, captivating murder mystery. Knives Out manages to combine the campy fun of Clue with a new and carefully crafted mystery, plus infuse some commentary about everything from detective stories to modern American politics, all while allowing Johnson's filmmaking voice to shine through. In the end, Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece.",Knives Out
740,amoore-4,Craig terribly miscast,6,23 January 2020,"Switch Don Johnson and Daniel Craig and you'd have a movie that would fare much better in suspending your disbelief. As a Canadian living in Austria all my European friends liked the movie because 1) the current iteration of James Bond is idolized more here than in North America, and 2) they wouldn't know a terrible southern accent if it hit them in the face. I couldn't get into the movie listening to a Brit making a mess of a regional American accent. The movie overall was good fun, but no better than 7.5/10. I'm being nice when I knock off only 1.5 for the miscasting. Kevin Spacey or a long list of other good American actors could have done better. Attempting to keep the 'Poirot' suave sophistication and British sensibility while playing a poor southern American accent was a mistake by casting and the producers who I'm assuming put star power over believability. The other acters were also underused. Worth a look but nothing special.",Knives Out
741,CasualFnSViewer,"One of the movies to end the year and decade with, Knives Out does well to balance its comic and serious aspects and deliver an impressive murder mystery/dark humor story.",9,19 December 2019,"Going into the film, there was not much I knew about it except for the genre it was categorized under, which was murder/mystery dark humor mix, as well as family drama, which makes up for part of the film's humor. The summary is really all there is one needs to know to get into this film. That and the fact that it's a pretty substantial and provides a very entertaining premise.Acting was superb. Chris Evans (Ransom Drysdale), Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), and Ana de Armas (Marta Cabrera) really fit well in the roles of their quirky characters. The supporting cast playing the family members do well to contrast each other in order to create a family that's seemingly cares for each other on the surface.There are also undertones of politics which I believe to be done tastefully, enough to add (flavor) to the film's narrative and characters' personalities, but not to the point where it ruins the enjoyability factor by cramming political opinions and ideas down people's throats.This film is a sure highlight for the year and deserves at least an award nomination, particularly for its writing and directing.",Knives Out

743,nizzambaharuddin,HIGHLY ENTERTAINING WHODUNIT FILM,8,13 January 2020,"""My House, My Rules, My Coffee"" The film starts and ends with this quote, perfectly roping in the audience on what's to come. Writer-director, Rian Johnson may have his fair share of haters because of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but even most of his naysayers may had a hard time nitpicking this film. It's that good.Knives Out is a modern take on the old whodunit film genre, which came to prominent around 1930s. The best thing the film has got it going for it is probably its clever writing. From the settings, to the characters and dialogues, all of it stands out. Hell, even the set is good. So much so that even though this film uses the modern settings, you don't feel like it is. You feel as though the film is a period piece, even when there's continuous use of modern gadgets like the smartphone. It's probably down to the antique set objects used.Second, its eccentric colourful characters. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is easily the best character. Imagine the world's best detective, most probably would imagine Sherlock Holmes; he's sarcastic, annoying, insufferable know-it-all and very meticulous. This guy? Complete opposite. Looks stupid, doesn't pay attention to details, etc. The only thing they have in common is their eccentricity.He's also the funniest in the film. Couple with other characters like Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), and Jacob Thrombey (Jaeden Martell) and you got yourself a winner. Coupled that with funny situations and deadpan dialogues, it makes the film feels like a Wes Anderson film but with modern settings.Probably the only downside of the film is the predictable plot. There's a few plot twist here and there, but not to the point that it might shocked you. And considering that it's the genre core elements, it's a bit disappointing in that regard. But the film's more than justified itself by going on this treasure hunt like feel that's usually are in films like Indiana Jones because of its fast-pacing, which makes it more entertaining because of the rarity of how usually these films are paced.Overall, this is a very good modern take of whodunit movies and sets a very high bar on future films in its genre. Hopefully this is a new start to the genre becoming embedded in the popular culture again.",Knives Out

The characters were well defined in a brief period of time and every single actor got a juicy part in the story. Almost all of them got to show a bit of humor in their part, which is probably one reason it has comedy in the movie description. I find if I say anything about any one of those characters I MIGHT give too much away. Kudos to writer, director, actors and that wonderful house setting.

This movie was probably one of my favourite movies of 2019, which is saying something because I think 2019 was a great year for cinema.The standout in this movie was Daniel Craig in my opinion, at points, i forgot it was Daniel Craig and that's a huge compliment to his in depth transformation into Benoit Blanc. Ana De Armas was exceptional as well, probably her best performance. The whole cast worked well, thought Toni Collette was hilarious, Chris Evans can act! Lakeith Stanfield was great as usual, Chrisopher Plummer has still got it.The story was incredibly well written, Rian revealed things at his own pace, for the first 20 minutes or so, I was really trying to find out who done it?Overall, just a fun time, I loved watching it",Knives Out

I knew in the first act there was no murder as I could see the writer wanted a BIG twist. So it had to be that the only innocent looking one was guilty but to reconcile that - either Harlon wasn't really dead or did indeed kill himself. And the D of P....hates us all to make us look up at Everyone in that awful angle in every shot, and in that lighting that even made Daniel craig look like asphalt.if you see it again - look at it, every shot the camera was low to the actors right. It's not pretty. The makeup artists must want to strangle him. I also knew the vials were switched when they made that silly ruse about playing earthquake and did the extra shot of the vials. No nurse is that stupid or enthralled to not read the vials (and later Daniel says it's actually because the was the best nurse - ugh). AND that clunky dialogue about ""they cant even tell a real knife""...I said to my husband that bit of useless data is coming back...and I also knew that game of throwns set piece was gong to play a big finish. Oh and that it was captain America who switched the vials by half way through as he's too big a star to take this job with so few lines in the first half. so as I saw it all roll out i had to just watch silly shenanigans for two hours listening to Daniels indeed KFC accent. Hate to tell ya but morphine in the vein (and why did he have a chemo portal for pain shots for a hurt shoulder?) at 30 times the dose - you are stoned in 4 seconds. And why did they think the tox report wouldn't point to the nurse and also if Harlon loved her so much and was still sharp, taking care of the entire families finances, and had given a 60 million dollar estate to the nurse and slit his throat to save her mother and sister from deportation, um, why hadn't he just hired an attorney to Make them legal for $4000 a while ago? I could do this all day...with the cop in the car she's gonna pick up her medical bag and then what, just put it in the trunk with Daniel sitting there?....and In the big finish I said to my husband when he grabbed the knife off the GOT chair - ""knife won't work"".

753,bock_g,A Good Friday night flick.,7,22 February 2020,"Being one of the few admirers of the much hated ""The Last Jedi"", I was excited to watch this film. Mystery films are generally not my cup of tea, but this one was really engaging. The plot was easy to follow, even with Rian Johnson's penchant for twists. The ensemble cast was great, though Daniel Craig's Kentucky accent bothered me quite a bit. Still, I think he's a good comedic actor-despite his irrefutable image as 007. The overall pacing was solid-this is what Rian Johnson is capable of doing if given the right genre and material. A stylish, and entertaining flick for a Friday night.",Knives Out

We could not even finish this. We cut our losses about half way through.
I enjoy a good mystery, But it has to keep you in suspense and it must MOVE ALONG. I like all of the actors and that is all I can say that's positive. The Characters, on the other hand, were not interesting, nor likable. If I were to try to finish this film I believe I would have lost the will to live.

756,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Movie in Summary: Good,7,10 July 2020,"At least quarantine has given me the chance to catch up on movies I've missed like 'Knives Out'.This movie has an incredible star-studded cast with spectacular performances across the board. Standouts include Daniel Craig and his Kentucky accent, Chris Evans telling people to eat sh**, and Ana de Armas with easily the best performance in the movie. Not only does Rian Johnson do a great job with directing this movie, but an even better job writing it.However, the movie mistakenly goes against the murder-mystery formula. We're given too much information too early, which makes the last half of the movie less interesting. The point of a murder-mystery is to play ""detective"", analyze the characters and see if you can figure out whodunnit, but this was spoiled for us too early. Even still, this was a clever, well thought out movie with great characters and a fun storyline.Score: 7 out of 10Recommended for: Fans of murder-mysteries, fans of Rian Johnson subverting your expectations, or fans of Captain America telling you to eat sh**.",Knives Out

759,scandinavianmail,Un-subverting the expectations,5,29 November 2019,"Knives Out is entirely built around a pretty clever twist that comes early own. Once that's out, it slowly putters out of ideas until dragging itself back to the mansion where all is revealed ... to be an average episode of Murder She Wrote.Editing, cinematography and acting is all top notch throughout. But bent on delivering its one twist and nothing more, the story has left the characters without fleshing any of them out. Everyone is such a paper-thin stereotype that quite a while it feels inevitable they'd eventually turn out to be something more but instead they all end up being just as completely one-dimensional as they first appeared. Poorly written characters also ruin heavy-handed attempts to say something useful about immigration and privilege.",Knives Out

768,mikeburdick,A mystery without a clue,5,25 December 2019,"As a lover of the old ""whodunnit"" genre, I really had high hopes for ""Knives Out."" It does, after all, have many of the essential ingredients: an all-star cast, a big house, a slew of self-interested characters, an unexplained murder. However, the biggest mystery in ""Knives Out"" is how it murdered itself.There are several suspects. Was it the casting director, placing such a well-known English actor into the role of a Southerner with a drawl? I mean, Daniel Craig isn't just British, he's James Bond.Was it the cinematographer, designing grandiose camera moves into every scene, including simple dialogue scenes?Was it the actors who-outside of Toni Collette-didn't seem to understand this was meant to be a comedy?Was it the producers, who couldn't decide what this movie should be, a comedy, a thriller, a satire, an homage?In the end, I suspect it was the writer-director who did it, on the page, with a fountain pen. Only he decided that each character needed to explain their story to the viewer, rather than leaving us guessing. Only he failed to add the humorous touches that could have made it entertaining-and extract some truly lame jokes. Only he was responsible for hiring actors who couldn't deliver the right quirk or humour.It's a shame, because I really loved certain elements-the homage to ""Sleuth,"" the not-so-subtle political message, some of the twists. But I couldn't help feeling I wished it was a bit more like ""Hot Fuzz,"" with its humour, memorable characters and witty dialogue. And a bit more like ""And Then There Were None"" in terms of its suspense and mystery.Normally, I'd recommend a mildly entertaining film, especially one with a good message, but this one is way too much of a mess.",Knives Out
769,anthony-burton4,Slowish first half but great finale,7,15 February 2021,"Firstly, this is a black comedy - don't expect any laughs until perhaps the closing scenes - unless of course it is at Daniel Craig's utterly awful US accent - thankfully he doesn't speak too often.It's quite good to see a murder-mystery that actually lays out the clues for you to link up yourself before actually taking you by the hand and explaining everything at the end. It's even better to see one that isn't predictable AFTER you've worked out did what when... yes, there's a number of threads that combine deliciously for the grand finale.Watch this one with a little patience - don't expect it to grab you in the first 45 mins but it's worth it for the second half.",Knives Out

771,tomfeller,Brilliant whodunnit,10,3 February 2020,"If you are a fan of the Agatha Christie-style whodunit set in a country manor or the old board game Clue, you should see this movie, which is a tribute to them. The murder victim is a best-selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who seems to have committed suicide the night after his 85th birthday party at his Massachusetts estate. The suspects are his dysfunctional family (Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Jaeden Martell, Katharine Langford, Michael Shannon), Fran, his housekeeper (Edi Patterson), and Marta, his nurse (Ana de Armas). Marta has a very peculiar personality trait that causes her to puke whenever she lies. A consulting detective named Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig speaking in a Southern accent based on historian Shelby Foote) is brought in to assist the police detectives (LeKeith Stanfield, Noah Segan). There are several Sherlock Holmes references. Craig and Evans are quite good, breaking out of their James Bond and Captain America roles, respectively, and the movie itself is very entertaining with some social satire thrown in. It is nominated for the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category.",Knives Out

Yes there are suspects, a murder, police officers, random events and a lot to think about. The story is a pretty decent one but I feel the last part of the movie just took too many turns.Daniel Craig's American accent is also as unbearable as they get and he probably talks the most in the movie.Intriguing and mysterious at times and even fun but wasn't a big fan of the way it all turned out.

You set the scene, fill it with the requisite sub-plots and characters to sustain curiosity, confuse and generally lead the audience up multiple and erroneous paths. Punctuate the storyline with revelations, flashbacks, re-enactments and twists and conclude with a satisfying reveal all.
All that is left is the dramatisation and the delivery.
Sounds simple enough.
Where this latest contribution struggles, stumbles and falls in a heap is the the casting. It needed actors. Ironically, there is no shortage here but the ones who can act be they stars or has-beens are all in minor roles while the main players are wannabes or never-wases who are unproven or in some instances disproven in dramatic roles.

Chris Evans and Ana De Armas bring such powerhouse performances in this film. The dialogue is witty and well written, there are twists and turns that I did not see coming. I think Rian Johnson is not as clever as he thinks he is, the script is solid and pretty tight, but in the end it's nothing different from what we've already seen before. I suppose that's my biggest issue, I'm not sure I'd say it's a different take on the whodunnit genre like some others have said, because in the end it's just the same old trick. The message and the commentary in this film was pretty obvious, ham fisted, and heavy handed.

784,brent-27849,Just another high rated lousy modern movie,1,23 September 2021,"BS all the way.BS #1. That he would have killed himself thinking she just poisoned him. First why would he necessarily think it was an accident? He just told his grandson he was giving his entire fortune to her in his will. How does he know she didn't find out, either by over hearing at the party or even if the grandson told her in a fit of anger as he was leaving? Why not think she was just like the rest, rotten? Oh, but he was old anyway. Yeah, except he's a titan who just cut his entire family off at the knees, to put it nicely. Seems like he would have wanted to watch what happened next, to watch them squirm and no doubt come crawling to him on their hands and knees - don't know, he seemed like the type who would enjoy that. No, he would rather just kill himself in the most gruesome manner possible. Because yeah, everyone knows, people always just happily kill themselves on the spur of the moment, wouldn't do absolutely anything to try and survive. What, the meatloaf got burnt again, well that's it, I'm going to slit my own throat for sure now.BS #2. That she's a good nurse. For giving him what she believes is the wrong medication. Craig, lousy, lousy performance, says in his big speech at the end, if Plummer would have listened to her about calling an ambulance, he would still be alive. Problem is it wasn't his call to make, it was hers, and if she had been a good nurse, she would have called and woken up the entire household as well. Also the medication, more BS, that a good nurse doesn't bother to check the label, can just go by it's viscosity. Anyone who thinks that, should take a taste test. Yeah, sure, take two vials, one filled with medication that can kill with the wrong dosage, rip off the labels, toss them in the air and then let a nurse or doctor just pick the one they want to give. Sounds like a great game show in fact, either win cash and prizes or die, I wonder how many people would like to be a contestant.BS #3. That she's a good person period. Plummer doesn't want her to get into trouble. Simple question, yeah, so? She thinks she's responsible for killing someone. If she was a good person, she would have come clean immediately. Instead she does everything possible not to get caught, including covering her tracks, literally. As well as trying to get rid of evidence, the broken wood, and destroying evidence, the tape. Then when she finds out about the will, does she come clean? Nope, now it's how can she not get caught and keep the money. Run from the police. Destroy more evidence, the toxicology report. Yeah, real good person here. All to deny a family their birth right. Not to say they're any good either, but family is family.BS #4. That Chris needs a private detective or to switch the vials back. Why not just ask for a toxicology report? First why wouldn't have that been done anyway? But even so, he expects the report to come back positive, the vials get tested, shows they were switched, she gets nailed because it shows it wasn't an accident, it was all part of her plan to try and make it look like an accident, of course she would know better, but as soon as it came out that she was the sole beneficiary, good luck, case closed. Speaking of the toxicology report, more BS. The housekeeper gets it because she has a friend, yeah, right. There's only a paper copy, nothing put on computer, yeah, right. She doesn't know what the report says, just assumes it shows the guy is guilty, so tries blackmail, yeah, right. The guy also doesn't know what the report says, because of course the report wouldn't just show it was negative to anything being wrong, yeah, right.BS #5. Pretty much the rest of the movie. Oh, motive was the will. Oh, the only he can actually show he's guilty of murder is if he confesses on phone and in front of two cops because of course he has no problem confessing to attempted murder on phone and in front of two cops. Craig's performance, which I again have to say, just lousy. The fact that he has her help in the investigation with the police blessing, even though he says he saw the blood on her shoe right away. Pretty much the entire investigation on its own. Which leads to BS #6. That this movie is any good. Period.",Knives Out
785,NBates1,"Funny, smart and engrossing",9,30 November 2019,"Being a big fan of mystery novels and films, I was really looking forward to watching this movie, and was not at all disappointed!
While set in modern times, the film has a really timeless feel to it, similar to the stories by Agatha Christie. While the formula is familiar; rich dysfunctional family living in a big mansion, all with secrets to hide, the twists and turns are quite surprising.
The entire experience is engrossing, and, while the story did not quite go where I initially expected, the ending was great, and actually smart. The whole thing was also really funny at times, adding to the whole entertainment value of murder mysteries.
Daniel Craig, playing detective Benoit Blanc, really goes to town on his role, with a southern 'accent' I never really heard before. Ana de Armas really shines in this movie as well, and the ensemble of great actors playing the eccentric family members all made their screen time memorable.
I highly recommend this movie.",Knives Out

The cast are incredible to watch as each actor portrays their character so well.I'm not here to imbue others, as far as it goes, we all have different interests ... this is just my own perspective of watching something else outside of what I am usually drawn to watching and, though I'd heard it was a great film from other people, I like anyone else, prefer to make my own mind up. I have rated this film a 10 as I found the film had interesting storylines and the actors characters incredulity were convincing to the point I felt like I was there.Although ...I'm prone to admit that I'm extremely jealous of captain America actor Chris Evan who is not only, IMO, a handsome bloke who just gets better look as he ages - raggy sod - nonetheless, green eyed monster aside, he's incredibly talented in his profession and everything I've seen him in, purveys his onscreen looks and presence are just so natural. Daniel Crao was great to watch too, stepping comfortably away from his Bond character and, reminding us viewers of his acting ability before the days of 007. As always, Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Plummer need no acknowledgement as their acting professional ability speaks for itself. The rest of the cast are a great selection that also enticed me to give the film a whirl.So, if you like whodunnits your probably gonna love the film and if you don't, give it a gander.. it's a film for me that flew by time wise- which I didn't expect for a whodunnit as I tended to find the creators would drag em out.

I mean they are literally all pointing finger at the guilty party entire film, and you sit there waiting for it to turn out to be someone else, but no, it is who they told you it is from the get go. the only mystery that remains is ""how"" and answer to that is ""in a very convoluted way that character is definitely to dumb to think of"". yup.there's nothing to save this film, where it tries to be charming, it fails cause it's too hollywood, and charm of this genre is british kinda thing. where it tries to be funny it fails, nothing more to say about that. where it tries to be clever, it fails cause it's either too in your face, or too convoluted to seem realistic. it's just load of nonsense that you can't even care for. and the characters are bland and boring. the characters they want you to feel most for, are so obnoxious you want them to be guilty, and there are side characters that fall together with the rest, for no reason, like some of them did nothing wrong, at any point, definitely didn't deserve what has befallen them, yet they all end up in same stew.it just makes no sense",Knives Out

795,ReaLMoisan,Contrivances and Bad Writing.,4,22 July 2020,"There's so many plot contrivances. Also, there's throw away lines to try to save horrific writing, and plug some of the most obvious plot contrivances. And don't forget, there's an ""intelligent"" inspector that doesn't even follow basic police procedures. Obviously, if this inspector was even remotely competent, the plot could never progress. The plot also relies on the inspector being oblivious to suspects committing a cover up right in front of him, and he lacks interest and curiosity in their suspicious actions. This isn't just an issue with the inspector, since every characters actions are ridiculous and only occur to push the plot forward. The film seems intelligent, until you realize every character is extremely stupid and/or lucky for the plot to work.There's so much wrong with Knives out:-No medical professional would ever administer a dose of anything without reading the label first (you instantly lose nursing licence). Especially when three medications use the same bottle.-Marta would have known within seconds that she didn't administer 100mg of morphine to Harlan. That's ten times the maximum dose, and the effects of intravenous morphine are almost immediate (literally seconds).-Morphine is a schedule 1 or 2 (depending on type and country) controlled substance, they would have secured Marta's medical bag, especially until the toxicology reports came back.-The only evidence of a toxicology report is a piece of paper. It's obviously stored on a hard drive, often offsite, and should already be forwarded to the pathologist from the lab.-Relevance of blood on shoe, without testing the blood, or even knowing it's blood. I've gotten blood on my shoes multiple times, it's always been my own.-They don't dust the window sill or trellis for finger prints. Marta wasn't wearing gloves when she climbed through the window. They also know it's the point of entry.-They let Marta use the temperamental VCR machine when the familiarized security expert is present. Resulting in destroyed evidence. Also, they use a VCR for security in 2018, really.-Benoit suspected Marta from the beginning, yet he lets her handle and destroy the VCR tape. He also lets her walk ahead and trample footprints and evidence outside too.-""Hue did this"", really. A throw away line that the help uses the name Hue, but everyone else uses Ransom. They use a very different 'Hue did this"" in the cutaway during the later scene.-The inconsistency of Marta's tell. After the car chase (evading the law), Marta just casually spits in a cup. Every other time she blows chunks. At Ransom reveal, she doesn't throw up for almost a minute and a half too.-Ransom's self incrimination to the Fran incident. A man who's been this conniving would just ask to see his lawyer immediately without saying anything.Do you know how long the scene with Harlan and Marta goes on for from the time he's administered the morphine until he kills himself, over eight minutes. That's including cutting out the extra pauses in time as his dialog pauses for the narrative showing Marta performing certain actions in other scenes. Over eight minutes passes, and by ten minutes it's death from a opioid overdose, yet he shows no adverse effects, either behavioural or cognitive in that time. Add in things like the prop knife (and another throw away line), dog bringing broken piece of trellis to Benoit, Marta pretending to be Harlan and Walt being outside smoking, etc. You have a film filled with plot contrivances. The absolute worst thing you can do in a whodunit film is have it riddled with plot contrivances.Anyone who thinks this film has a clever plot with intelligent writing needs to watch it again, and with a critical eye. The amount of plot contrivances would make any plot weak, but in a whodunit mystery, it's unforgivable. There's so many issues with this film, I could write a five thousand word essay on the topic. But, this film isn't worth the effort. Funny, considering the writer of this film put in just as much effort on the script as I did on this review. The only positive thing about this film is the hope that it's undeserving success and acclaim invigorates the genre. Hopefully, encouraging more competent people to make better mystery movies in the future.",Knives Out
796,systersister,Treading water,6,29 December 2019,There was no nerve in this film. And the actors was underused. I guess it was some kind of Orient Express inspired screenplay but to compete with Agatha Christie is(even if you put a Agatha look a like in the film)pure hubris of some dimension. There is no real finesse about the film and to have Daniel Craig talk in some southern dialect make no sense. Is it supposed to be funny?Doesn't add anything to this strained and rather dull movie. Is it only the English who can do a real whodunit?,Knives Out

However, you had a feeling that each one of them kill him, and that was an awesome feeling. The best performances was from Daniel Criag who has a character that is new to me, a detective comedian, sort of, plus Chris Evans who passes his shield to Anthony Mackie to become a bad guy which was so refreshing and good for him moving forward in his career. The ending is what makes this one a 10/10 picture because it is twisty and very interesting to wait for. Last but not least I enjoy the high class feeling of this movie, and I want to watch more movies like that in the future. The question is: Is it OSCAR Worthy? I would say yes. Which category?

I've never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it's meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn't pay to see it and I'd feel I'd wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was ""So what? Who cares?"" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people's Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special.",Knives Out

809,nambivp-33248,A treat for the fans of Agatha Christie,10,12 February 2020,"Rian Johnson brings to screen Agatha Christie type of mystery. A murder takes place. The people in the house are the prime suspects. They can't leave the house until the murderer is caught. There is also a big reveal towards the end. This movie is everything that a fan of mystery novels can ask for.
There are red herrings in this movie and you actually fall for them. Ignoring a few things that are very illogical, like a girl who vomits after telling a lie, this movie is engaging. There are no loose ends when the credits start rolling. Rian Johnson finishes the story neatly without leaving any room for plot holes. The screenplay deserves a special mention. The editing is brisk and racy, effectively keeping you on the edge of your seat. The music is at best, forgettable.

814,manisimmati,A delightful throwback to classic whodunnits,8,19 January 2020,"In »Knives Out«, the seemlingly clumsy private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hell-bent on illuminating the mysterious suicide of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a famous crime novelist. Blanc teams up with Thrombey's shy nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas). But of course, nothing is as it seems; the Thrombey family is as colorful as it is shady.Oh, I love these classy crime movies! You know how it works: An old patriarch dies and his whole family wants to inherit the fortune he leaves behind. And of course, you gotta have a creepy mansion with secret passageways as well as an eccentric private eye. Director Rian Johnson (»The Brothers Bloom«, »The Last Jedi«) follows the tried and true formula to a tee, his love for the genre is apparent. There are some ironic moments and references (»Clue«; »Murder, She Wrote«), but most of the time, Johnson plays it straight.The pacing is fast and entertaining, Benoit Blanc and Marta Cabrera are likeable main characters. Craig apparently had a lot of fun with his portrayal of the strangely clueless Blanc. You always wonder what's the deal with this guy. I personally would have loved to see some kind of backstory for him, but I guess the mystery surrounding him is fascinating as well. De Arma's nervous and kind-harted Marta is very endearing; when you watch this movie, you really want her to get out of this mess unscathed. And yeah, the fact that she has to puke whenever she lies is bloody brilliant.»Knives Out« works very well as an audience flick. The movie theatre was cram-full when I watched it and everyone had a great time figuring out the twists and turns. Of course this movie doesn't reinvent the wheel; a weakness with most of these stories is the fact that the plot tends to become a bit too convoluted at the end. This happens here, too. But regardless, »Knives Out« is a charismatic update to a familiar genre, political undertones and a dumb yet thrilling car chase included. I'm already looking forward to the announced sequel.",Knives Out

You will NOT regret it!",Knives Out
816,ksb77,Awesome who done it,9,31 December 2019,Haven't seen anything quite like this for some time. This genre of movie I thought had been done to death. The trailer in my opinion was not that appealing to me personally but I went following some strong recommendations from friends and family. What can I say ? The film simply blew me away. The best film in its genre hands down. Brilliantly directed and acted by a ensemble cast who gelled perfectly. I didn't see any of it coming which in today's reveal all world was very nice. Liked all the cast. Big fan of Christopher Plummer and Daniel Craig however the entire cast in my opinion were all on par with each other. Rian Johnson does an amazing job with this one. Go see it and enjoy it. Money and time well spent.,Knives Out
817,haroldareynoldsIV,Brilliant movie for 2019; Well Worth the Watch and Surprisingly Hilarious,8,10 January 2020,"Rian Johnson actually spoofs himself and the genre in this (what will soon be) modern classic.After a consensus failing on his Star Wars take with The Last Jedi, Johnson actually returns to his best and perhaps most famous roots by digging into his Breaking Bad roots. That's right. Some people might have missed it, but I picked up on it easily since that is one of my favorite shows, and Johnson directed some of its most famous (and notorious) episodes (Ozymandias....Fly respectively).Make no mistake- Knives Out is absolutely its own thing, but Johnson was not hiding his roots here. First of all, ask yourself, what was his most famous directorial scene from Breaking Bad? Was it, when Skyler chooses the knife instead of the phone in the climactic scene? Of course, and she pulled the ""knife out"" there, as in knives out. Second, wasn't Johnson the director of the notorious ""bottle episode"", which is equally hated and beloved? Well yes, and this is a claustrophobic movie mostly set in one single place- a mansion. Third, the actress (De Arma) literally acts just like ""Lydia"" in most scenes of the movie- an anxiety-ridden, desperate, back against the wall performance. He could have just put Laura Frasier in the role and you couldn't have told the difference. Fourth, the dark humor, which is generously spread throughout the movie and never forgotten. How about the cell phone usage reliance for so many scenes, but with dark humor reiterated along with it?Yes, Johnson learned a lot from Breaking Bad (as well as brought so many great episodes to it), and he brings so much of his brilliance into this fun, dark comedy. How many people caught the Game of Thrones reference with the knife throne at the end? There is just so much dark humor spread all throughout this and so many fun homages and references. Some people won't fully get it, and yes I admit it is a little over the top at times to some extent, but not enough so to say it's anything less than a great movie, especially for 2019, where originality is lacking. However, this movie has more than originality going for it. What a fun time and an immersive and enjoyable (although very slow and bumpy) ""ride"".I've now seen 1917, Richard Jewell, The Irishman, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Joker, and some others, and ironically, if it all came down to it, this would actually be my Best Picture vote for 2019.10/10",Knives Out

820,LansTaylor,Donuts and donut holes,9,14 March 2020,"I never knew how much I needed to hear Daniel Craig talk in a southern accent. Him talking about donut holes inside of donuts was a much needed comic relief in such an entertaining movie. There were very few moments, that I could remember, that were slow; every scene I felt like something important was being said or done.
I was truly waiting for the twist when Harlan would jump out at the end and reveal that this was just another game to see who was worthy of this inheritance; but I like this ending better.
My favorite scene was the police chase when Ransom was telling Marta to step on it and it zooms in on the speedometer barely cracking 50 or 60 mph.

823,thomasfarr-95295,"A brilliantly executed, incredibly entertaining murder mystery!",8,9 August 2021,"To say Knives Out is entertaining is a understatement, the cast is charismatic and the story moves at a swift pace, if at any moment you began to feel bored, the film sweeps you back in with another reveal in the story, which simply gives you no other choice but to find out how this impacts the story. The twists in this film were great and the way they were revealed were great, seeing the different characters perspective of scenes, which leads you to question what really happened.The characters bounce off each other well and each one has their own distinct personality and quirks which allows for funny interactions between them and also to serve the story. I did think some of the characters could have been given a bit more depth, however due to the pace of the film and the way its told, there is not really a time to do that.If there is a weakness about this film it is the last act of the film, I just felt like what made the film special was thrown out of the window, and it wrapped up in a slightly generic way, and the segment where the final twist is revealed wasn't all that satisfying to me. However, this is barely noticeable while watching the movie and it barely dampens the experience at all.All in all, Knives Out is a great mystery movie, with an engaging plot, charismatic characters who play off each other brilliantly, however, it suffers from overly simplistic characters and and slightly weak third act, but is still a incredibly entertaining, well executed film.",Knives Out

Unfortunately that drama never really gets fully established enough to make the ending convincing or satisfying. The script also frequently falls into the pit of telling and not showing, which is understandable to a degree considering it is a story where investigators use interrogation to help uncover the mystery, but it just feels awkward being in that pit during especially key points in the story. The nicely assembled cast offers some fine performances with what's there, but the prevailing feeling at the end is that there could have been and should have been more.",Knives Out

I had some low expectations coming into this film, especially considering Johnson's work on the recent Star Wars film, but this absolutely blew me away.you could tell that so much thought was put into every part of the set and every syllable in the script. It really is that detailed. The cinematography does exactly what the DP wants to achieve. Very fun anamorphic shows that bend and warp rooms but also make the subject feel alive and in context. The acting performances were very solid across the board, but Daniel Craig really stole the show. The character was just unbelievably entertaining.I'll take points off for this film's final explanation of what happens. There is a certain suspension of disbelief that a fun comedy film gets that a 'Usual Suspects' does not, but this film tiptoes past that line once or twice. This film will also likely not age exceptionally well, as there are some very topical lines. In any case, it will live on as an example of how good 'fun' movies can be.",Knives Out

Her acting is not very believable (stop with the constant sighing! It's tiring and your director should've stopped you from doing so). Double oh Graig has a painfull accent and other then that not very much to play with.And then there is the mystery... oh boy. Agatha Christie for beginners. First rule: it's always the butler. Or better said: someone that isn't acting suspicious, but cooperative. Second rule: if halfway the movie the mystery seems to have been unravelled, the mystery is definatly not unravelled. And third: never forget the emphasized details: they always lead to the solution of the mystery.Agatha Christie for the advanced: play with the expectation of the seasoned mystery reader, play with those three rules and mix em up. That unfortunatly didn't happen here.And finally: Yes it had a few laughs, but not enough to be a comedy.

847,sebastianschlicht,"""A doughnut hole in the doughnut's hole."" - Amusing crime thriller!",7,3 April 2020,"Rian Johnson, a name that makes many ""Star Wars"" fans unhappy. ""The Last Jedi"" was able to inspire many critics, but the fans ... They not only disliked the film, they typically exaggerated it and sent hate mails and stuff like that to the director. It even goes so far that some of these ""fans"" want to boycott Johnson's new film just because he made a ""Star Wars""-film that they didn't like. Pathetic!
But of course, this is about ""Knives Out"", the crime comedy that has so far been very successful. Why? Now maybe people are looking for a classic ""Whodunit""-film or maybe because the cast is so great? Who knows, who knows... The fact is the film is well received, both by critics and viewers.Crime writer Harlan Thrombey is found dead in his villa. Suicide. But that's just the first thought. Because the well-known detective Benoit Blanc is at the crime scene and is investigating the case. And Blanc suspects more than just simple suicide. One of the reasons for this are the countless family members who are more interested in the rich old man's legacy than in his death ...""Knives Out"" is an entertaining crime-thriller, but the words ""thriller"" or ""crime"" doesn't quite hit it. Johnson a movie that is more of a satire of a classic crime film. Well-known clichés and typical plot lines are skillfully twisted and exaggerated here. Johnson uses a lot of humorous approaches that work very well in my eyes. The dark humor in particular fits well into the film, but so does the more sensitive moments.The cast is one of the most important positive aspects: Daniel Craig as detective Blanc is wonderfully charming and funny, Chris Evans the rebellious black sheep, Ana de Armas the good-natured housekeeper and Christopher Plummer the dear but mysterious grandfather. In addition, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and even Frank Oz are here and have fun with the material, which is transferred to the audience.Technically, ""Knives Out"" is also very entertaining and impresses with some interesting and funny camera shots. Nathan Johnson's score is very fitting and wonderfully over-dramatic, funny.Regardless the movie has some flaws. Maybe because I wanted more ""surprises"" in the end or because I was missing a little more insight into the smaller secondary characters. I can't say it exactly, but a little more fine-tuning and sharpness in the dialogues wouldn't have hurt the film here and there.Conclusion: Nonetheless, ""Knives Out"" is a very entertaining and well-made ""thriller"" that plays with well-known tricks of the genre and offers an excellent cast. Worth seeing!",Knives Out
848,q-11775,Knives Out,8,14 April 2020,"Hidden in the image of paying homage to the traditional British reasoning novels and movies, it is actually a wanton rebellion against this classic type. Such absurd settings and nearly naked political implications as a number of unreliable narrators plus an absolutely reliable narrator are rarely seen in hard core reasoning works.",Knives Out
849,q-85184,Happy hunting,8,11 May 2020,"The name ""blade out of scabbard"" makes me mistakenly think that it's a domestic killer film, so I'm not interested in the name of it. Then I was curious to see the recommendation of multiple friends.
It was not until the end that I thought the name was well translated and ""pasted"".
There are no special effects in this movie, and there is no big bang scene, which is a common thing that makes people feel like ""changing ticket price"". Even the parts of reasoning are not so hard to guess, just ""delicate"". This kind of arrangement is a little arrogant. The subtext is ""no need""
It really doesn't need those, because it's easy to bring people in, with a strong sense of presence throughout the whole process, almost delusional that it's like sitting in a stage scene - not even under the stage.
Although most of the plot is very small, it is not boring at all. Only with the camera and story rhythm firmly stuck in the eyes.
Moreover, the amount of ""nonsense"" in the lines is very small. Although it's a suspense film, it doesn't burn the brain. We don't need the audience to concentrate on what they may have missed, so we can use our brains to watch the movie.
It's as if there's a well-trained magician behind the whole screen. He opened the card early and didn't cheat you. But you can see more than you can see.
In addition to the layout itself, it is also ingenious to shape the characters.
At first glance, it's a very old-fashioned setting and layout, and even everyone's personality is as standard as a sample. However, such a rigid setting itself is also a kind of burying block, just like the essential element of satirical mime.
Therefore, it will still make people smile: such a human nature exhibition hall like unfolding, are all reasonable and unexpected. In the voice over, I heard the magician's giggle at all kinds of things in the world, so you laughed clearly.
And the most interesting thing is, a theme that enlarges the ugly reality, a puzzle sugar pot with distorted meaning.
But there is one that is relatively simple. The story ending of the youngest child.
It gives people a pleasant experience of watching movies.

The main problem is the storytelling. You find out so much about the ""mystery"" so early that it completely deflates the tension. Rather than the story building toward an exciting conclusion, it plods along to the inevitable. To call this is a mystery is not accurate.

They steered your brain towards one story in the start, so you don't start thinking yourself otherwise it was easily predictable film. I liked that trick, because instead of working on their screenplay, they worked with your brain. It doesn't matter if you pay attention to little details, because they won't effect the climax or let's say twist. Performances were quite alright, actually I like when Toni Collette performs, she's one of best actress out there and so was Daniel Craig himself. Katherine Langford, Chris Evans and Michael Shannon are other names that kind of acted subtly. All others were just there trying their hard. The most solid performances was by Jamie Lee Curtis. She absolutely stunned me with mature enough acting. Anna de Armas was there to wipe all efforts of great cast. Moving towards plot, there were no plot holes I witnessed. There might be, but I didn't notice any. Music was admirable and so was cinematography. Execution was properly done, a point to filmmaker. And at last but not least, the ending was little amateur, I'd have loved it more if it was complex enough. Thanks.",Knives Out

Next was the lame attempt at subtle political commentary. That failed. Then you look at the director's previous work and the movie feels tired.
The reason I give this any stars is because the a tors were ok, the camera work was great, the set was awesome, and that's it. It's pretty but that's about it. Just like looper, it was more about style and ideas than actual plot. Both films felt forced and underwhelming. Don Johnson was decent, I didn't mind Daniel Craig's hammy performance, and Ana De Harmas was decent.",Knives Out

The idea was interesting but didn't allow for the viewer to watch more than snippets of action at a time. It's was a study in 'tell don't show' expository and if anything happened at all it must have happened at the end. I couldn't make it through more than an hour and was surprised there was an hour more to go when I hit stop. Knives Out is a poor attempt at dark comedy thriller that was sold to the masses via celebrity stunt casting and beautiful cinematography and color grading. It may look like something more than Hollywood popcorn fluff but it isn't. This movie will be forgotten as soon as the next one in its genre is released.,Knives Out
862,jacobywarner,Absolutely Genius... One of My Favorite Movies of the Year,9,28 November 2019,"Wow! I just got out of the theater and I can honestly say this movie was absolutely perfect, there was humor that wasn't forced, pauses that weren't rushed, all connected with brilliant sound design. This is an absolute gem and I 100% think that is deserves a lot more praise than I have been seeing in reviews.I want to start by giving props to the editor, this movie really allowed for pauses to build tension and create a very slow burning rhythm that compliments the story pushing both the stylistic and narrative components to further heights. However this is also a direct result of the preparation and execution of Rian Johnson and Steve Yedlin when it came to the production process. They use delayed whip pans to really give a very unique whimsical feeling when watching the film, this along with slow zooms and low angle shots advance the audiences perception of the cinematic world. Also I would like to add that this film has more ways of filming someone walking down a hallway than I thought possible. I think that it is important to also bring up the actors performances, I have to admit that after watching the trailers I dreaded seeing Chris Evans in his role as a deviant troublemaker because they cut out the most out of context lines creating a very cringe trailer but after seeing the film this couldn't be farther from the truth. He really broke out of his Captain America phase bringing a very noticeable stage presence, but Ana de Armas stole the show. She proved that she is not just a supporting actress giving a both developed and mature performance. It didn't hurt staring alongside the established actor Daniel Craig.With all that being said I am rating this film a 9/10 because the final product is a fun experience that has something for everyone.",Knives Out
863,utdaxiao,Great movie!,8,5 December 2019,"As a fan of police romances and investigation I loved the movie. Of course it isn't perfect as there are some open strings in the investigation. But the clues and how the story is played out makes it an almost perfect ""who dunnit"" story which is a must see for people who like this genre. It is enjoyable and funny to watch. The cast is competent and the acting is great.One thing that I would like to highlight is the bad habit that the current blockbuster american movies have to include political discussion into the movie. It is completely irrelevant to the movie, it doesn't add to it at all. We already have such political discussions everyday during the week, we don't spend money to to see this kind of stuff in the big screen as well. Of course it doesn't not ruiin the experience of this movie, but they need to learn that this need to stop.",Knives Out

If you are a big fan, see it -- you will enjoy the flick. It was hard to stay awake for the first 2/3 of the movie as it meandered along. Aside from the lead actress being adorable and Daniel Craig miraculously maintaining his southern accent throughout the film, there was little to draw a viewer's attention. The final third got interesting and at times compelling even to a non-fan of mysteries. But I'd have rather seen an important and thoroughly mesmerizing compelling film like ""Dark Waters"" a second time to seeing ""Knives Out"" even once.That is, unless you are a big fan of the who dun it genre. My wife, who is such a fan, really enjoyed this frequent mess of a movie.

866,joshtill-98100,A Star-Studded Murder Mystery That Does Not Disappoint,9,24 May 2020,"I'll admit it, when I first saw the trailer for Knives Out, I was a bit sceptical. I did not know what to think. Growing up I used to love Agatha Christie murder mystery novels, but after 2017's star-studded Murder on the Orient Express turned out to be just mediochre, I was not as excited for this film as I should've been. Knives Out has something for everyone in the family, a huge ensemble cast, a riveting storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and beautiful direction. As a long-lasting star wars fan, I was left disappointed after Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi, but boy did his direction abilities ever shine in this movie. Every actor, every scene shines in its own way and you follow the clues to solving the murder of Harlan Thrombey.A week after Harlan Thrombey's (Christopher Plummer) sudden demise, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), his nurse, is called back to the Thrombey residence by Harlan's immediate family for some questioning from the police. The police question every single one of Harlan's relatives: his daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), her son Walt (Michael Shannon), his daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette), Linda's Husband Richard (Don Johnson), Joni's Daughter Meg (Katherine Langford), and Walt's son Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Ransom (Chris Evans), Linda and Richard's son, couldn't make it to questioning nor the funeral. Sitting in the back corner of the interviewing room is Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), and he soon realizes that through their interviews, each one of them has lied only once.Blanc interrogates Richard, for some people claimed he had heard him yelling at Harlan at his birthday party the night before he died. Richard then states that Harlan was harrasing him as he had found a picture of Richard cheating on Linda. Harlan writes a letter to Linda and claims he will give it to her the next day. While interviewing Joni, Blanc realizes that Joni had been stealing money from Harlan, which he meant for Meg's school tuition. While interviewing Marta, he finds out that Marta has a reguritative reaction to whenever she lies. Blanc analyzes the thrombey's night and what could have possibly led to Harlan's demise: Ransom and Meg left the party early, and Linda hears someone coming down the stairs 3 seperate times: the first was Joni, who was checking on Marta and Harlan after she heard a loud thud, the second was Marta, leaving for the night to go home, and the third was Harlan coming down for a midnight snack. Meg comes home later that night and attempts to fall asleep, but is awoken by Harlan's dogs barking.That night, at Harlan's memorial, Marta talks to Fran, Harlan's maid, and calms her nerves by smoking with Fran and Meg. Outside, Blanc finds Marta and asks her to be his second in command, which she accepts. Marta then recalls the real story of what had happened that night: she and Harlan headed upstairs to go to bed, but Harlan insists they play games in the attic. In the attic, they play games, where Harlan knocks over the board, which he tells Joni what the loud thud was. Marta then proceeds to give Harlan his daily medicines, but realizes she gave the wrong doses to him. After she couldn't find the antidote, Harlan states that she must leave and come back an hour later, using the side ladder to head back upstairs, put on Harlan's clothes, and disguise herself as Harlan getting a midnight snack. Harlan lies down on his loveseat and slits his throat with a knife. All goes to plan except for when Marta comes back downstairs, where Harlans mother mistakes Marta for Ransom.The day after the memorial, Blanc and Marta examine the security footage to see if anyone came in that night. With slight of hand, Marta switches the tapes and hides the real one in a plastic fridge magnet. As they approach the side gate to the house, Marta sees her footprints and walks over them to hide the fact that it was her. As the family prepares for the will reading, Ransom arrives in an oddly happy mood. He then pinpoints Jacob for being very quiet during this investigation, to which Jacob responds stating that he heard Harlan fighting with Ransom at his birthday party, and blantly hearing something about the will. At the will reading, it is announced that Harlan left all his assets to Marta and left nothing to his family. Marta is bombarded by the Thrombeys before escaping with Ransom.At a restaurant, Marta tells Ransom the full story of what happened that night. Meg calls Marta and asks for part of the inheritance, to which Marta accepts. The next morning, Marta is awoken by her family who say that lawyers and paparazzi have been at their door all day. Marta attempts to sneak out of the back, but encounters Walt, who threatens to deport Marta's family for her mother is an illegal immigrant. Marta escapes and finds a semi-scanned toxology report of Harlan with the words ""I know what you did"" handwritten on it. Marta and Ransom head to the police station to get the full Toxology report, but upon arriving, find the building up in flames. After Blanc notices Marta and Ransom together, he chases them into town, where the cops take Ransom hostage, while Blanc stays with Marta. Marta checks her email and finds an address and a time stamp. She heads to the address, which is a closed laundromat, and finds Fran's nearly-deceased body. Frans final words to marta are ""you did this"", but Marta calls 911 and attempts to save Fran's life.Upon arriving back at the thrombey residence, Marta tells Blanc the full story, but he responds saying ""Ransom already told the police"". Marta finds the toxology report, hidden in Fran's secret stash drawer and lets Blanc read it while she attempts to tell the thrombey's about her actions. Before she can, Blanc summonds Ransom and Marta to the den. Blanc solves the puzzle: Ransom was aggrivated when Harlan told him that every asset of his would go to Marta and he storms out. He then turns around, climbs up the side ladder and switches Harlan's medication and steals the antidote. Ransom attempts to go back to the house in the middle of the night, but the dogs bark and he runs away. Marta, being a good nurse, realizes the slight change in viscosity of the two drugs and gives him the correct dosage, ruling Harlan's death a suicide. During Harlan's funeral, Ransom comes back to the house to steal Marta's bag, but runs into Fran on his way out. Fran threatens to out Ransom, but he finds a way to gas her and lock her in the laundromat. He then proceeds to burn all evidence that Marta is innocent by burning the police station. However, much to his surprise, Fran had 2 copies of the toxology report: one hidden at the residence and one in her purse. As Ransom attempts to kill Marta, he unawarely uses a stage knife and is arrested on the spot. Later, as Ransom is driven away, Marta stands on Harlan's balcony, looking over the Thrombeys who are all distraught from the truth of Harlan's death.Knives Out is riveting at its core. One thing that is so cool about this movie is that it straight up tells you what happened merely halfway through its runtime. The second half is the chaos that ensues after, from Ransom burning the evidence to the Thrombey's attempting to blackmail marta, to a whole different death. The problem with Knives Out is that its tone sometimes finds itself to be a bit repetitive after the big reveal. Each star shines in their own way in this film, but the shinning star in this movie is Ana De Armas as Marta. She played her so realistically since you could potentially make that character really hateable. In the end, Knives Out is a film that I could watch several times and noticed different clues or foreshadowing every single time now that I know the killer's true identity.Overall, Knives Out gets a 8/10.",Knives Out

As the goofs section noted, the geography was off, and timeline on the morphine injection that the housekeeper received didn't make sense with what had been discussed earlier between Christopher Plummer and his nurse. Come to think of it, the timeline they discussed didn't make sense when the nurse gave him an overdose. And what was with Daniel Craig's accent?

878,leonweis,No detective story.,7,29 March 2020,"At first place this movie is great, because it shows some greedy family and some innocent girl involved in this drama, which at first place hasn't anything to do with the suicide of big daddy.The actors are all great, and it's very good entertainment but....: For everyone who wants to solve the case for his own this movie is way too obvious and gives you all the hints right into your face. It would be way better if we didn't get to see so many perspectives and if you reduce the comedy elements, because a lot of them are not funny. Furthermore you don't get to know the characters very deep and there is no big mystery to solve. As watched 5 min of the movie I hoped that the whole family is involved somehow or at least many persons. This is a movie for people who aren't interested in real crime stories where you have to think. This is a movie for distracted people who need every information instantly to not get lost.At last point I have to say that the moral of poor innocent Migration girl gets the whole heir is also very poorly written. I mean, what did the family do to him that he was so upset. This thought of saying people have to learn to stand on their own feets lacks in so many senses. he could have said his whole life to them: you should something for your own. With something like that people doesn't learn, they get frustrated because they lost every moment of reacting to this new situation. To be honest I was a bit sad for the family. Ok they were a bit greedy, also some betrayed him or her daughter, but this seems like an over the top reactive drama.",Knives Out

Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn't, at all).I also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don't care for how it was shot; it's terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There's something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn't quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a ""message"" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There's also no need for Daniel Craig's poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there's more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there's less.",Knives Out

A whodunnit where the viewer is hardly involved, just presented sterotypes of outlandish people (get ready for SJW speak and the naïveté that comes with the extreme left). Everyone's repulsive, except for the Colombian maid whose purity rivals that of the baby Jesus. Like I said, you just watch the narrative unspool, but it's no fun because you're not given enough character development for the viewer to turn into a participant. Screenwriting seems to be a lost art form, more and more. The last 15-20 mins of the movie is nothing short of the detective telling the viewer and other cast members who did what to whom. It's essentially what should have been the pitch for the studio, but instead of turning it into a film, they just let Daniel Craig explain it all in one breathless and BORING ""finale"".

It appeared so screamingly obvious who the killer was i was utterly expecting to be outwitted and proven wrong but no it was that person all along. Such a great cast too and hardly a peep out of them, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, both with no character development whatsoever. Surely in a murder mystery you have to add more than just one motive (money) to keep us guessing. I really don't get it. The whole thing in fact was a dead giveaway SPOILER ALERT - when the main character injected the victim and he didn't immediately shut down. She literally dosed him 25x or more of his usual painkiller, such a stupid imperfection, if she was a nurse she would have known that he wasn't reacting in away someone would if they had been seriously dosed with morphine. Sure in the ins and outs of how the killer did it i didn't know but wasn't really anywhere near great enough to out merit the obviousness of the culprit.

Rian Johnson made something that could take to the stage someday, and I think it's that kind of audience that this would compel most.To say that it delivered would be an understatement. Every minute of the run time mattered. It had this interesting way in which information was revealed in a front-loaded fashion, and yet still left you with necessary questions that you couldn't dodge, and you constantly questioned with the people around you.

I had initially rolled my eyes and thought that Knives Out would it be a fairly standard, average run-of-the-mill murder mystery that would also try to too hard to be funny that it would come across as arrogant & self-absorbed in its own ""art"", similar the posturing tone of the Grand Budapest Hotel. Yet these dismal expectations of Knives Out were thankfully and surprisingly dashed.The film strikes the perfect balance of intrigue, suspense, excitement, eccentricity, warmth and amusement. The entire cast are excellent, particularly Daniel Craig and the main character. There are some really funny scenes too and it's quite difficult to make me laugh out loud at the comedy material applied to most films. Yes, it can of course be argued that Knives Out has the usual tropes of the traditional Agatha Christie styled murder mysteries, but it builds on those traditional tropes and I think it creates something quite unique. It made quite an impression.",Knives Out

Most of this clunky script, however, is not.From the lazy 'lying makes me gag' plot device, the completely flawless protagonist, the unnecessary Leftist political undertones... Knives Out is a bit of a mess.It takes too long to get going, and reveals far too much, too early on. There's a reason crime thriller conventions exist, and that's because they work. Rian Johnson seems to believe he is above such conventions, so it is no surprise when after 45 minutes or so, the film starts to fall apart after Marta is revealed as the ""killer"".Some have said this is a parody of the whodunnit genre, but there is only so far that excuse can wash. With plot holes galore (Harlan thought of that intricate plan for Marta in the space of 10 minutes?), and an abundance of 'far too convenient' explanations, as a viewer I stopped caring about who did what.It doesn't help that Marta is a one-dimensional character (basically a personification of Johnson's politics) who I couldn't root for. Actually, I was actively hoping she'd be killed. I'm sorry, she was annoying.Overrated and complete with a completely obvious finale/""reveal"" (I feel a bit cheated with that ending, Ransom was so obviously culpable from his introduction), you can't help but feel this film thinks it's way cleverer than it actually is.",Knives Out

901,grayner-2,Kind of overrated to me,6,30 November 2019,"I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a ""commentary"" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don't see it as being ""best of the year.""",Knives Out

903,Jiszmo,"Awesome Who Dunnit, (just like the old days)",10,27 February 2020,"I just this second finished watching this, and I have to say, 'This is a Great Movie'. It's been ages since I saw a truly great mystery, who dunnit, detective story. I'd say, this is one of the greats films of that genre. It really captures that Poirot (Peter Ustinov) or Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) type of atmosphere. It has a very similar visual style, as well as, a similar sense of humor. But then amp it up about 50 time (lol). Anyways,this film is basically great.I really liked all the characters. I liked the family and all their interpersonal dramas and bickering. (Once again this reminds me Mrs. Marple or Poirot or Poirot.) It's always good to see Jamie Lee Curtis. She just keeps getting better and better with age. The other actors were unfamiliar to me. But they were all very good.The detective in this one (Detective Benoit Blanc) is also unfamiliar to me. I don't know if this is based on a book or what. Anyways, they should turn this into a franchise. The adventures of Detective Blanc. He is quirky, funny, and all knowing, just like those other greats I mentioned before. (Though I have to admit I wasn't sure if he knew anything until the very end.)The twists in this. OMG! So many twists' in ways I never expected, or saw coming. This movie does a really good job of amping up the mystery genre. There's even a bit of over the top action. But, it's done really well. Really though, it's the twists, and the mystery, that is tweaked out, and amped up, more than the typical mysteries, of the past.Final Verdict: I strongly recommend it to fans of mysteries, who dunnits, old dark house, etc..",Knives Out

910,majoreasy,Nice try but no cigars...,5,8 December 2019,"A Stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... Sadly, instead of ""the plot thickens"", it thins out unbearably...Overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...A whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..Spoiler Alert...Let's tackle the minor annoyances first...1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...No building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn't add up to murder...This means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...Here however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)In fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...This leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...She didn't have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn't add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?This gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!That's ridiculous and again feels forced/false...4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...Firstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn't be able to find one...Secondly, Walt is the 'boss' of a printing empire and it's unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...Thirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...Is he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance?
Wouldn't Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn't that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...Ok, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he's not Captain America, surely wouldn't choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..What does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...Marta explained that he will die in
10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...Wouldn't a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?
Many more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the 'interrogations'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn't around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta's shoe...Too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...Now...Let's get to the parts that killed the movie/story...1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...Examples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn't mix up 'back' and 'back again'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...If he's wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...These plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...Since Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn't have done it...3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...When Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...And obviously, Ransom couldn't have done that too...4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn't stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom's car, not a single person stopped her getting in...This is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...In conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall...",Knives Out

4)) about comedy side I think there is no comedy in hall movie
5)) what a great acting from Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig

An early twist in the plot puts this film on another level, distinguishing it from other murder mysteries and making it a unique experience. The characters are very distinctive, and the brisk pace means that the 130 minute runtime is never boring.

This does not work with Star Wars tho. The movie is a thrill to watch and making like you are in that situation makes it even more exciting and fun.

The staleness of the story we all read and saw so many times did not really keep me at the edge of my seat.
The same can not be said about Knives Out which is a very good take on murder mystery movies. It is full of interesting characters who are played by strong and well established Hollywood veterans. We have Christopher Plummer. Don Johnson. Jemmi Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette and of course Daniel Craig, ohhhh Daniel Craig who created an extraordinary character who I hope to see more of and with the huge sucess of Knives Out this might be quite possible. Other played their roles great too, Anna de Armas, Lakeith Stanefield and many others complemented the rest of the cast really well.
The setting of the movie transports you in time, it was a very clever choice of a place for an action to take place in. Creaky stairs, period Victorian house was a clever nod to the era in which brilliant Agatha Christie's books were written in. The movie takes inspirations from her novels and does a pretty good job at it. The house also acts as a great contrast between the worlds of poor and rich.
The dysfunctional rich family and aspiring middle class migrant worker are caught in the intrigue surrounding mysterious and sudden suicide of head of the family. Minute after minute you will get sucked in into this well realized world of mystery.
I really recommend this movie to everyone. This is a breath of fresh air and a wonderful break from all the superhero movies and also a proof that you do not need wonderful books or comics to create a wonderful movie. With the right people Hollywood is still capable of creating their own fantastic stories and fabulous characters. Thank you R Johnson.",Knives Out

923,gmaileatsyourlunch,Overrated - trying to be a coen bros film,5,29 February 2020,"When not spoon-feeding you its plot through lots and lots of dialog and flashbacks, Knives Out takes ridiculous short cuts, the dumbest of which is a main character who throws up anytime she lies. In its better moments its obviously meticulously crafted but your ability to enjoy it will hinge on whether these amateur crutches sprinkled throughout are tolerable to you or not.There's another problem with this murder-mystery comedy. Neither of the main characters are very funny. Daniel Craig is trying too hard to stay on top of his (bad) southern accent and Ana de Armas basically has one facial expression the entire film: worry. All the funny is in Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis, who are completely underused and eliminated from the list of suspects far too early in the film. They never even elevate to credible threats to the protagonist by blunderingly interfering.Knives also can't help but wade into the current Hollywood vogue of jamming politics into literally everything. Exploration of political or social issues is a wonderful thing in film... when it's done right. Knives just hamfistedly tacks it on, and not in a subtle way. 40+ years after Blazing Saddles and this is what passes for progressive today. Of course she's poor and hardworking and can't even lie without throwing up. And because of her unrelenting honesty she wins in the end. But you know, those are generally *good* stereotypes so you critics better give it a good rating or else.Beyond its politicizing, Knives Out unfolds with a kind of smugness that's irritating. A self-assuredness of it's wit and writing it never quite achieves. What it does achieve is something approaching a diet cola version of a Coen Bros film. I'll be surprised if anyone still remembers this film once its early shine, and especially it's politics, wears off.",Knives Out

925,jvg37,The Ones Giving It Bad Reviews Must Not Have Actually Seen It!!!,9,23 November 2019,"Just saw the AMC advanced screening of this film, and it was extremely well done! The story did start off kinda slow, but it picks up quick. The acting is better than expected even with such a talented cast, and it was well written, although it did feel like Toni Collette was trying too hard. There was no ""mcguffin"", no surprise character introductions in the third act, and everything was up front at all times. There was no ""secret"" piece of information introduced at the last minute that would give everything away. The ending caught me off guard not so much because of the who, but for the how of it...All in all, it is a brilliant mystery that balanced story, plot, and humor without compromising on quality. Daniel Craig could very well have another hit franchise on his hands if they were to create additional cases for him to solve. This is provided that the same quality in terms of writing and story is adhered too.",Knives Out

931,docentliktez,The BEST Plot Twists of the Decade!,10,30 May 2021,"Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" put him into a next level. He had some fame with ""Brick"" and ""Looper"". Those films were well made and had interesting ideas executed even better. Then he had bad reputation with ""The Last Jedi"" that many consider one of the worst movies in the Star Wars franchise. I myself don't hate that movie but it IS one of the worst Star Wars movies. I was really excited to watch this movie anyways
not watching any other of his movies. Then I watched it, and I LOVED it. I am really surprised this didn't get nominated for best picture. But moving into the film, I love the cast. Especially Daniel Craig who is just messing around with this detective look and a weird French accent. I loved that. Other standouts were Chris Evans, Toni Colette, Ana De Armas, Christopher Plummer for me. Especially Toni Colette who was just doing her thing in the best way possible. She was so funny. There are something like 3 events happening in the middle of the film that all relate to the murder. There are so many little details that you don't forget that are mentioned in the 3rd act that make sense. You ask a question like why was that left in there? Or hey, why did he/she do that? I just think this film was executed so well. I would say that this film a masterpiece and probably in my top 10 favorite movies.

It goes on way to long, it's a poor adaptation of the film 'Clue'As performances go, Daniel Craig with his dodgy southern American accent is bad.. stick to James Bond..Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette came out tops in this in my opinion.. they normally always perform well..Katherine Langford is so wooden and reads a script like it's just been handed to her and and comes across like a cardboard cut out.. (nothing has shone from her since Season 1 of the dreadful show, 13 Reasons Why, and that's the only reason she's here riding off the fame of that one season as Season 2 is trash)It's also a shame you don't see enough of Christopher Plummer as he's the star performer in this film..But to many stars and not enough screen time for the best of them..Believe it or not I wanted to like this film.. it's done well at the box office, decent reviews, took the money but I think I expected to much, it's way overhyped and nothing you've not seen before..",Knives Out

And I enjoyed this film in the sense that it is the sort of film the cinema desperately needs these days. There are no flashy visuals, no spectacles, or extraordinary premises. It's purely about the stories and the characters, through which this film shines.
Overall, it's a competently directed film with solid storytelling, great production value, and an amazing cast.

It makes the entire thing seem pointless because it is so easily predictable, and takes FOREVER to get the answer out.

936,damfaz,Intriguing and amusing,7,3 June 2020,"The thing I liked the most from this movie is the attention to details. Each
character's relationship with the poor Harlan is meticulously described. This
allows you to evaluate which Trombey member could be the murderer and why.
On the other hand, since all characters are treated in the same way, you
can easily deduce that none of them could be the killer after the first part
of the film. The only exceptions are given by Marta and Ransom.Marta is revealed to be the murderer halfway through. But wait.. In the
first half of the movie we are superficially led to believe that she is; so
I think that the choice of this ""fake reveal"" is not so smart because if you tell
me who is the murderer after half movie, OF COURSE that is not the killer.
Despite this choice that I did not appreciate, I enjoyed the final moment
where the truth comes out, it was well written and filmed to me. Also the picture and the production were pretty good.To sum up, I think that this is a funny mystery movie and I don't understand

Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren't any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery.",Knives Out

Only the stick with which we were treated to learn the lesson was maybe to hard and used too often. I managed half of the movie and at this point I had to pause the stream. I am sorry. I appreciate the hard deal quite some migrants get. I am an immigrant myself. But this is just too much. It may be that if done 10ya and seen 10ya this would not be so striking. I do not think so but maybe I am just too biased after string of movies that showed the same characteristic.
You can have strong female and immigrant characters in less obnoxious and self-righteous way. After I ended the misery with this I watched max payne and here you had exactly that (and a shootout). Here is a detective story where intellect fights intellect as well as emotions. Or rather should have done that but could not because woke prevented that.
I would have given it 1 if not for the cast and original idea. Convoluted as they all are in a detective stories it still could carry a film but not if one has to watch for ideology all the time.

I have not a clue.The story is flat, the attempt to twist things totally not interesting and overall superfluous as paradoxical as it sounds. This comedy is supposed to be kind of intellectual one, as it is not slapstick, so there has to be something else. I see nothing. You can watch it as some sort of expensive production of a TV episode of something, just for its cast but I fail to understand what all these high class actors are doing. Supporting what? Story, scenery, accents...? You could put there any group of average actors and the movie would have had the same quality.But these days, the quality of entertainment got so low, so, yes, from that perspective this is a super movie. I am sure it will be very soon forgotten.And I am very certain that people went to see this movie attracted by the cast thinking the same as me that a movie cannot be nothing if it gathers so many stars.

How the script achieved Oscar nomination status is beyond me. The Cast of characters never gelled in my opinion and were childish, superficial, loud and annoying. Daniel Craig's accent was unbearable and I was really going to throw in the towel until it seemed to settle down and become more tolerable in the last half hour with the emphasis being placed on a smaller circle of actors (notably the nurse and Hugh) ... and the action of the storyline driving us towards the reveal. I love a good Whodunnit and, sadly, this was not one. I'm so glad now I didn't go to see it in the cinema.... as someone else said it would be perfect to watch on a plane or train journey ... otherwise I kinda felt cheated and that I'd wasted my time especially when there are so many other much worthier shows to watch. Glaring holes in the plot, dogged pace, uneven and overly dramatic sound, unrealistic shallow characters yelling at each other like children, preachy dialogue at times, neither realistic nor spoof and a family not really deserving of their fate from what we're shown. Ultimately, there really wasn't a logical enough reason for his ultimate action in the first place so it never made much sense to me. ..
I would have enjoyed the film much more if it had been condensed into just the last half hour... without the need to put the name actors through a ""community theatre"" experience. I felt they must have been embarrassed to be in some of the scenes with their weak dialogue and lack of direction. In their defense they simply had nothing to work with so no chemistry or cohesiveness emerged. Very disappointing especially after all the hype.",Knives Out

962,movieguy96,"A re-evaluation of Rian Johnson, with a tour de force ensemble!",9,22 December 2019,"I'm pleased to say that Knives Out confounded my expectations in the most surprising and joyous way possible. One of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at the cinema in a long time, it not only pays homage and slyly subverts the conventions of the murder mystery genre, but it also made me re-evaluate my opinion of writer-director Rian Johnson as an artist in his own right.After the drubbing he got over Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Johnson's reputation has been stuck in the quagmire somewhat, a name synonymous to fandom as arguably sabotaging a much loved franchise. Whilst this matter is debateable in of itself, Knives Out showcases how much of an ingenious and skilled auteur Johnson can be, even more remarkable when working within the confines of a relatively modest setting and budget. This minimalist approach allows Johnson to be experimental; free reign to carve a richer canvass of quirky characters and surprising red herrings, which serve to enhance the plot and character's motivations rather than undermine it.I do not know what decision making process went into Johnson being chosen as directing SW: TLJ. I believe half the time the studio finds a director who produced a movie, or series of movies, which offer a uniquely immersive experience, or have showcased a idiosyncratic interpretation for movie-making in general, and given them the unfair burden of helming a multi-million dollar project which is totally incompatible with their skillset.I have literally just finished watching Looper on TV, for the second time after originally watching it in the cinema, and I was staggered by the narrative and tonal similarities with Knives Out, in terms of how the story unfolds in a nicely convoluted yet inventively slight manner. Johnson has never given himself more than what's he's needed in order to create his vision, EXCEPT with the notable exception of SW: TLJ, and therein my point is concluded.Johnson's audaciousness and prerogative to subvert expectations works so well when he's focused on a stand-alone project which he's conceived from the get-go, but taking responsibility for a tentpole movie which is a) expected to adhere to the conventions of the franchise/genre, b) please its die-hard fanbase, and c) fit in nicely with a gazillion dollar Disney gravy train; he was almost doomed to fail right from the start. That's just not Johnson's style, and the studio should've realised that.This is not to say I'm going to re-evaluate SW: TLJ as some sort of overlooked masterpiece. Far from it! It still has problems, quite a few in fact, but you want someone who's going to toe the party line, not an individual who does things his or her own way. To this end I believe that Johnson has suffered unfairly, purely because of the studio's naivety.But anyway, back to the movie...The way in which Knives Out unfurls in front of our very eyes is a masterclass in misdirection and cracking entertainment. The narrative is created purposely to focus the viewer on the here and now; to not let their minds wander. You hinge on every word and action. You could almost accuse the movie as being episodic with its shifting focus of multiple character strands, were they not interweaved together so delicately by Johnson's deft touch, and the enthusiastic portrayals by the ensemble cast at his disposal.Indeed, it's difficult to know where to start with a cast so large and talented. As with most movies with a multitude of big names, a lot of actors fade into the background, merely there to draw in the crowds while not actually contributing or enhancing the viewing experience. Knives Out, on the other hand, is a very different story.Each and every cast member lends their own personality to the piece, with passion and gusto. You could tell everybody was having a lot of fun making this movie, as Johnson's given them a lot of rich material to draw from and make their own. There seemed to be an overriding, and palpable, chemistry between the actors which meant you totally believed their relationships and motivational self-interests.With a canvas this large you'll forgive me for not singling out any specific names, however I must give special mention to of course Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas, the latter a revelation in her non-showy but memorable performance as a timid yet strong-willed caregiver, integral to the plot. In many ways she carries the movie, as the viewer is aligned with her from the very start, and she's the prism through which we see the infighting and breakdown of the Thrombey dynasty. To pull this off with a degree of believability, and more fundamentally likeability, required an actress who could showcase a series of subtle yet telling emotions to which the audience relates and understands. The fact De Arnas is a relative novice to the movie industry, with little opportunity to flex her acting muscles beforehand, makes her casting all the more inspired.Craig, though, is an absolute delight and hoot as the private detective tasked with solving the case. His exaggerated deep southern accent and clichéd powers of deduction lend themselves greatly towards the eccentricities of the movie, and serve to enhance his character's affability and larger-than-life demeanour. Craig is definitely revelling in chewing the scenery (or probably more apt, furnishings) at every opportunity he gets.As for the supporting cast, I actually considered Lakeith Stanfield to be a perfect level-headed foil for Craig's more rambunctious character, and it was nice to still see Christopher Plummer in the spotlight with a tender, and affectionately wacky, portrayal of the family patriarch.Knives Out has its twists and turns at every corner, and dares the audience into questioning what they're seeing in front of their very eyes. Nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems, and Johnson is never satisfied with settling for a by-the-numbers and generic whodunit. He chooses to keep us delightfully bewildered and encapsulated with a cracking rollercoaster of a movie which is literally fun for the whole family!",Knives Out

It had it's unnecessary lengths where it tried to be situtionally funny or smart but failed, so it never kept me glued.
Was not a fan of Craigs American(?) but liked his character alot didn't enjoy many other characters but that's expected. The whole throwup when lying thing felt just used in childish ways it was stupid and annoying. Car Chase Scene also very anticlimatic and weird.
It is cool that the movie always was honest with it's clues.
Acting at times felt a bit too theatrical but it was used that way to make it funnier but it didn't always hit the spot for me. The Knives Out Theme of the Vultures arguing over the Testament did never escalate in a dramatic way it supported the comedy and also didn't stress the film too much or just not as much as i thought it would.
Probably the pacing wasn't that good but the last twenty minutes were great - throwups.
An enjoyable Movie with that Sunday afternoon feeling though it is like i could easily fall asleep if i watch it a bit tired also i could argue about the joy of watching it multiple times.
Last notes Cinematography and editing was nothing spectacular Soundtrack also not so remarkable i expected a bit more when i saw the Cast and thought about the production value of course it isn't an actioner it just felt very static and oldschool, a bit of an hommage to the thriller classics in that regard maybe.",Knives Out

974,bigmin,Massively underwhelming,4,28 January 2020,"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really.",Knives Out
975,jrwollscheid,Cannot wait to see more like this from Rian Johnson,9,31 August 2020,"Another brilliant piece of cinematography from Rian Johnson. The film is great as it twists through the murder of mystery writer Harlan Thrombey. Chris Evans, Daniel Craig, and Ana de Armas shine in this film as they bring this film to comedic peaks. The film leaves some to be desired as the ending can be predicted quite easily, but is still a charming movie that's still pretty funny. I first thought it would be bad as it appeared that James Bond was playing Colonel Sanders as Sherlock Holmes, but as I watched it Daniel Craig stands out as a comedic character and probably my favorite character overall. The movie taking place in Thrombey's dark mansion helps set a tone and mood for the film as a whole. The creepiness of the mansion gives an uneasy tone for the audience and is used to great effect from the use of knives everywhere to the foreign-appearing furniture and decorations.

I did not go into it with much in the way of expectations but I judged it worth a look going on its rating here. I am so glad that I did.The movie is something of a slow burn. The pacing of the first act seems slow, but then builds up in the second act. The third act is awesome and represents a huge payoff for those who stick with it.It is an incredibly clever movie which by the end of it will amaze you with its attention to detail.Anna de Armas puts in a delightful performance of Marta. What a gem!I am somewhat torn by Daniel Craig's performance of Benoit Blanc. I think the accent that he affects is too distracting. I am not sure exactly why. Maybe it is just not Daniel Craig-esque or maybe it is not maintained at a consistent level.Chris Evans plays what appears to be a bit part. He is hardly sighted in the first two acts and I was a bit disappointed as I want to see how he does in a role post Captain America. However, that is just a ploy and he comes into his own in the third act. It was a wonderful performance that almost stole the show from Anna.So why not 10 stars? I have asked myself that question a number of times. I struggle to give an answer. It just did not feel like a 10 star movie. Maybe 9.5 but we only have whole numbers to work with. I think the reason is the pacing of the movie in the first two acts, although I am wondering if in fact I am being unfair as I think the slower pacing at the start leads to a bigger payoff in the end. You be the judge...",Knives Out

982,facebook-835-889963,"Not Brilliant, not horrible, just kinda meh.",6,26 December 2019,"Who dunnit like a good whodunnit? (See what I did there?)Knives out looks great on paper. Ensemble cast filled with great talent, all sure to be delivering quirky, eccentric performances through a roller coster plot with a twist at the end. What could go wrong?Overall, I thought the actors delivered well, no real faults. Indeed, the performances are all the more impressive considering some of the odd casting.
Craig, who was horribly miscast, puts on an unexpectedly enjoyable performance as a sleuth from the Louisiana Bayou. de Armas puts on a very strong performance despite the horrible character device she was handicapped. Special mention for Evans who does a wonderful turn as creepy bad guy. Clearly Evans has been miscast in the past in all those hero roles.The dialog is decent enough as well. A wee bit Hollywood at times but not achingly so. And a fair amount of good jabs as the quirky characters cut into each other.And I'll tip my hat for good cinematography. The film did look wonderful.So what went wrong? In a word, the plot. Points for novelty, but the circumstance is just too improbable to accept Plummer's reactions. But that really isn't the worst of the film. The biggest problem is that the plot places far too much of the story on de Armas' character. So much so that all the other characters fall away and become largely irrelevant. And when one particular character stands up to assist de Armas, well, you know then and there whodunnit. That whole ensemble cast, who each should have been vying for a place as the bad guy right up until the very end, instead relegated to a bit of shouting and noise from the sideline. It's the pre-school toddler's, 9 piece puzzle version of a whodunnit.There you go, a fair and honest review without mentioning Rian or Star Wars........",Knives Out
983,con-fan,Just saw it and do not understand the hype,6,7 January 2020,"I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one. I'm not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me.",Knives Out
984,Nhirscher,A Brilliant Who-donut,8,29 November 2019,"The magnetic Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is by far one of the greatest filmic creations of 2019. This film, and specifically Blanc, brilliantly walks the line between campiness and seriousness; and, in doing so, is one of the most enjoyable theater-going experiences of the year. Just one of Blanc's ridiculous, Southern, overlong monologues about the pursuit of truth will have you laughing in a confused awe.This film's screenplay is smart, as it reveals crucial information early and still surprises and excites throughout. Similarly, this film tricks you into thinking you know the right information, just to show you how you've been missing it all along. Every detail matters, as crucial information is quietly planted in the first few scenes to end in loud, surprising payoffs. Knives Out is a tautly written whodunit.This movie is beautifully clever, and I recommend it to anyone with a free afternoon.",Knives Out
985,Cold_Aqua_Tomato,Overrated,3,5 April 2021,"I can't understand why everyone is pissing themselves about this film. It's a standard Agatha Christie-wannabe mystery, but with a mystery missing. You know who the murderer is basically from the beginning (provided you have a functional brain), and the rest is a snooze-fest. Took me three evenings to finish it, and those evenings were months apart, and that was only because I don't like to leave things unfinished. The acting, I regret to say, was not great either. I was only glad to see this actor, what's his name, the Captain America one - can't be bothered to look him up - playing a baddie, because he has a negative charisma, if any, I don't know how they choose him to play all positive cartoon characters, although let's be honest, he's no Anthony Hopkins, it's dumb luck (hi Hollywood) he's an actor at all.

They were a ""grand"" wealthy family tripping on each other's eccentric ways. Each was an Over the Top version of a Mother, Father, Son, Daughter & Housekeeper. The only normal one was MARTA the Nurse.
Don Johnson! Who knew? He was great as was Chris Evans and Michael Shannon. These guys I would NOT expect to be in a Movie like this. The one that stole the movie was Daniel Craig. This is about as far away from Bond as he could get.

The story is intriguing and the pacing is near perfect. As expected from this amazing cast, the acting is good to great through and through, with one of the best performances of 2019 from Daniel Craig. Extremely happy for Ana because thanks to Blade Runner 2049 and this, she's very much on her way to be a superstar. Rian once again bathed his film in stylistic cinematography, making it one more cut above other movies.

988,naturallyrockin,Would be a Fantastic movie if it wasn't slathered in horrible language,8,7 January 2020,"First of all, I've been an Agatha Christie fan since high school, so I absolutely love good 'whodunit' movies. This movie was very cleverly crafted and well-written from a plot and character standpoint, so for a mystery lover/fan, it was an extremely good movie. But the language was so bad throughout the movie, that it ruined the experience for me and the person who invited me -- they were disgusted. I am so disappointed that Rian Johnson would make the choice to degrade an excellent film by throwing in gratuitous word-vomit. It was completely unnecessary -- one or two words would have been sufficient, along with the theme and bloody image, to get a PG-13 rating. Because of that, I won't buy the dvd, nor will I recommend the movie to my friends. This movie would have been a '10' in my book, if the language didn't exist.Daniel Craig's accent seemed forced through most of the movie, so it took me awhile to adjust, but I did love his role.Lastly, I just want to say that Ana de Armas was a new face to me, and she was phenomenal in her role. Great actress -- I was extremely impressed. The fact that she is stunningly beautiful in a sweet, natural way, didn't hurt either.",Knives Out
989,abelka-91121,Mr. Blanc is investigating,9,15 June 2020,"Why are criminals good? Or ""Who done it"" stories in English? Because of the mystery in itself. Because of unknown, undiscovered cases, murders. Enough for these is a good basic story, a couple of exciting characters and an interesting venue. Although crime scenes are more present on television today, mainly due to the high-profile programs of the 90s and 2000s, let's not forget the classics either. Hercule Poirot comes to mind for everyone about Agatha Christie, not by chance. This is what Rian Johnson put into today's environment. The director says the film was inspired by the works of Agatha Christie, and it shows in it, its atmosphere is similar to the villa striking in the Ten Little Negroes. A big house full of secret doors. But even his figures are surrounded by the world of crime. The protagonist, who in this case is the victim, Harlan Trumbley (Christopher Plummer) is a crime writer, and his house is also full of references from his books. Or one of the detectives (Noan Segan) recalls the writer's works all the way like an obsessed fan.
Speaking of the characters, Johnson put together a brilliant guard. Chris Evans, as the grandson of his eyes, who sees through the selfishness of his family, provides a parade shaping. Linda Drysdale, Harlan's daughter, is shaped quite well by Jamie Lee Curtis. I felt a bit throughout the film as if the family was in his hands, not even the men being the directors. The film also features Don Johnson, who plays Linda Drysdale's husband, Richard. We can see Harlan's son, Walt, played by Michael Shanonn, who is the heir to the Trombley book publisher. Or the other grandson, Jacob, played by Jaeden Martell, known from AZ, as the grandson of a pampered oblique Nazi who embodies the trolls fiddling with his phone. He is one of the sources of humor in the film. The other, of course, was Evans played by Ransom. The great-grandmother also represents humor, K. Callan brings the typical senile grandmother, but it is her character who also has a role in loosening the screw. I left the main characters at the end of the list, Ana de Armas brings the innocent nurse captivatingly well; or maybe a certain ability helps him? Daniel Craig, as a private investigator, is an exciting mix of investigators he has met so far. It's reminiscent of Poirot and Holmes, but it has its own line of thought, a certain perforated donut metaphor through which we can get through the film. Chemistry works very well between the two of them. I wonder what they will produce in the next Bond movie.
The script is also worth a few words. The interrogation is structured in such a way that everyone tells what happened from their own point of view, and the work of the cameraman helps with this. This is the most ingenious thing about the nurse, where we can see a complete recollection during a toss of money and the relationship between Harlan and Marta is outlined. The dialogues are well structured and contain a great deal of information for the investigation, so we can also help resolve the matter. The film contains a lot of pop culture references, starting with television crimes such as Killer Lines. series where we can follow the adventures of writer Jessica Fletcher or have a look at the Circle. horror is. In addition to the solution mentioned above, the cinematography adds a lot of classic settings to the film. Such is the scene in the living room of the house when Mr. Blanc is sitting by the fireplace. The big totals shot from the house add the mystique to the whole story. Steve Yedlin's paintings evoke the atmosphere of a classic crime scene.
The roughest part is that family members all set themselves up as loving family members, but Johnson shows them to be selfish people, thus questioning their role in the family. So it's not even a real family, just a congregation of money-hungry, exploiters who aren't as sincere as they show themselves to be. I really liked this multiple change of perspective. In his films so far, Rian Johnson usually caricatures, reverses the elements and structure of the given genre. While this wasn't really the case with The Last Jedi, it's coming up here with new, exciting, fresh ideas that hold their place in the crime genre as well.
Overall, this film is the film of the year on the crime front and a must-see for Craig fans. For those who like crime, it is recommended that they get the film because who knows when we will get such a brilliant work within the genre again.",Knives Out

993,robertrutledge,"Good, but not great",7,23 April 2020,"Harlan Thrombey, an elderly, wealthy, and highly successful mystery-novel author, suddenly appears dead in the bedroom of his mansion one morning after an apparent suicide. The authorities, however, are not convinced, believing that someone murdered him. They enter the wealthy estate to interrogate those who had been on the premises the night of his death: Thrombey's numerous survivors who had been leeching off his financial resources and are all at each other's throats over the inheritance. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), an accomplished, seasoned, highly-introspective detective, joins in and ultimately takes over the investigation, citing an anonymous hire. The key player in his search is the late Thrombey's personal nurse, Marta Cabrera, a young woman from Paraguay who cannot lie without subsequently vomiting.
This movie is a clever modern-day rendition on the classic murder-mystery genre. It has a compelling plot with many twists and turns. The aesthetics (scenery, music, etc.) are all very ""Clue-esque,"" bringing a sense of Victorianism to an otherwise modern-day setting. The acting is believable. The heavy use of characters' own individualized flashbacks to the night of Thrombey's death is tasteful and effective. The same ""scene"" is shown multiple times, but from different characters' perspectives and own personal recollections.
However, this movie also had its flaws. Some of the characters were outright annoying or inessential to the bigger picture. Some of the lines seemed as if they could have been taken straight out of a Hallmark movie, others were just in bad taste. I never felt a strong attachment (or strong dislike, for that matter) for any of the characters. In fact, there were too many characters, making it hard to develop emotions for any of them.
All in all, Knives Out was an entertaining yet easily-forgettable film, and the fact of it being a murder mystery makes me question whether or not it would be worth watching again. I would say it is worth watching, but I don think it lives up to all the hype.",Knives Out

999,SimonsRants,A 7.9 is Laughable,4,30 July 2020,"I saw this in theaters back when it came out and filmed a review for it where I was amazed at how early responses were so positive. I was sure at the time that the rating would drop to at least the 6s but here we are in the summer of 2020 and it's rating is almost an 8. An 8! Movies in the top 250 have 8s! 8 stars and above are reserved for the greatest movies of all time and this movie - to the majority of people apparently - is ALMOST that good?! The Terminator has an 8, The Princess Bride has an 8, Charlie Chaplin's The Circus, Hitchcock's Rebecca, Rocky and so on... This is that level?Well anyway, enough with that. Onto the review:From the second I saw the trailer I knew 90% of the outcome. Is that a bad trailer or bad writing? Probably both. But the fact that they were harping so goddamn hard on Chris Evans' character being the bad guy meant that either he wasn't or they were trying to make it so obvious that he then couldn't possibly be the villain. But then they make him seem far too nice and likable and that confirms that he most definitely is the bad guy.
The rest of the characters of awfully written with terrible political commentary taking precedent over actual character development. Christopher Plummer was the only performance I enjoyed and he was hardly in the movie before he died! Some have tried to tell me Daniel Craig was good in this film and all I could do was laugh! He was terribly unfunny in his... odd character portrayal. And his awful accent disappeared and reappeared between scenes. Awful performance made worse by the awful script.
Which brings me to the writer/director Rian Johnson. I haven't seen any of his other films as I missed Looper and never cared to double back and haven't been into Star Wars' sequel trilogy at all so didn't bother watching his one. So, it's not a personal vendetta I have against him or anything but after this film with it's muddled writing, pretentious feel, and lackluster plot I have no intention to ever see anything else he does. Not saying I won't, but at this point I have no reason to.
On top of all of the things I have already mentioned, the plot is also boring and filled with mistakes. There's a plot twist near the beginning of the second act that then leaves you bored waiting for anything else of importance to develop until well into the third act. This is extremely poorly paced and had me checking my phone constantly in the theater. And then as for the plot holes - I left this for last because it's so awful - the character of Chris Evans is supposedly the one who poisoned the house keeper. But it was plainly laid out to the audience earlier that an overdose of morphine would kill you in 20 minutes but when our protagonist finds the housekeeper hours later she isn't dead yet. This is just lazy and silly writing.So, to wrap it up... I have no idea how anyone could think this movie is above a 6. Frankly, I gave it a 4 and I think that's fair. But if you said a 6 I wouldn't argue with you. Anything above that? You're out of your goddamn mind.",Knives Out

1006,heyitskeane,Pretty damn good.,8,25 November 2019,"This movie is pretty good. A solid 8/10 and probably one of the best in 2019.Knives Out (as minimal as possible) is about the death of a family patriarch and the investigation of his death. It's written and directed by Rian Johnson; he did Looper which was great and The Last Jedi which was not so great but anyways..This movie is pretty damn good. It's a classic who-done-it crime/detective story set in modern day 2019. It's directed beautifully and the cinematography is on point. And it's actually very funny, which I don't think the marketing really shows.The performances in this movie are fantastic, especially by Bond himself, Daniel Craig. He carries this movie and honestly his character is an absolute joy to watch. The rest of the cast is great as well, notable performances from Ana De Armas and Chris Evans.The narrative and writing is also very well done by Rian Johnson. It's nice to see him doing films of his own instead of big franchise movies.Some of the characters are kinda there just for comedic effect, but
I didn't mind it. It wasn't really a bad thing, didn't bother the narrative. My main 'issue' with the movie was that I was hoping the actual plot itself involved more of the characters directly, if you watch the movie you'll probably notice that. It's not really an issue just something I thought would've made the movie better.Other than that I don't really see an actual flaw in the movie. The opening sequence is just perfect, the sound design fits perfectly. It's funny when it needs to be and suspenseful when it neds to be. Knives Out hits all the checkpoints of a good solid movie.Definitely check this one out it's really good, really enjoyable and an absolute killer (no pun intended).",Knives Out

Accidental genius? Perhaps. But still, the end product somehow shines.I hated the Last Jedi, a film which made me question the sanity of its writer-director. I'm beginning to think that Rian had some inner passive-aggressivity with Jar Jar Abrams or someone else that loved Star Wars, and that he knew exactly what he was doing by ruining the continuity of Star Wars with Episode XIII, because this film is pretty darn good despite the flaws aforementioned. Dare I say, well worth watching.Still avoiding TROS like the plague, but Knives Out is actually not a misfire.",Knives Out

The thing I enjoyed the most was that the plot was unpredictable and engaging. I spent a large part of the movie speculating what would happen next, only to be thrown for a loop. That was thrilling, and it really felt like I was a part of the film!
Second, the character development was so well done (as it should be for a murder mystery). The actors did a fantastic job of portraying the depth of each individual, while simultaneously weaving a bigger picture that incorporated them all.
Third, the use of light/sound/angles contributed and emphasized the mystery of the film.

1015,nickphelan-25748,Knives back in the drawer,7,27 November 2019,Well this is a bonkers movie. An Agatha Christie country house murder mystery with a great cast of suspects. Daniel Craig is the private Eye helping police find out who killed the rich dad Christopher Plummer. Don Johnson Jamie Lee Curtis Chris Evans Michael Shannon Toni Colette and Chris Evans are the family members in the frame. Ana de Armas is the nurse another suspect who's a ringer for a young Rose Byrne. I enjoyed the twists and turns and ending but some of the cast play it straight while more ham it up which is disconcerting. It certainly doesn't take itself seriously and overall its good fun but Daniel Craig sounding like Kevin Spacey is very creepy!!!,Knives Out
1016,q-02121-71714,I love Chris Evens,9,2 April 2020,"Full of respect for the famous detective novel Agatha, but also integrated into the director Ryan Johnson's own idea of keeping pace with the times, ""sharp blade out of sheath"" is a suspense film with classical implication and careful logic, during which a mansion murder case has created a mystery, but the truth of the appearance is not the whole of the film, the symbolism and satire of the political level, and the praise of the beauty of human nature. Have become the only point of view of the film out of the machine.In the cast, ""sharp blade out of sheath"" is not strong, the role of the detective is the former ""007"" Daniel Craig, and the grandson of the killed rich is ""the United States"" Chris Evans, of course, there are many old Hollywood faces starring, not to mention here. It is not easy to bring together a group of Hollywood stars, let alone how to make good use of this group of actors with good acting skills, thanks to Ryan Johnson's excellent control of the characters and the superb acting skills of the actors, in ""the sharp blade out of the sheath,"" the film successfully portrays a rich family picture with each ghost baby, especially Daniel and Chris, who have succeeded in tearing off the inherent impression of their previous films.The luxurious manor, the 85-year-old rich reasoning novelist Howard, died at home after his birthday, hoping to inherit the huge inheritance of the family, from the texture of ""sharp blade sheath"" with classical implication to the development of the film plot, ""sharp blade out of sheath"" is very much like Agatha's case detection story, but the first surprise of the film to the audience is that Agatha's development is not the whole of the film. It did not retain the truth to the final moment, as Agatha's novel did, but revealed the truth about Howard's death in more than half of the film, but what was even more surprising was that there was no bad person interested in the disclosure of the truth, on the contrary, the multiple reversals that followed brought the film into the new best part.",Knives Out

As entertaining as the already dreadful US TV version ""The Murder She Wrote"". Yes, not good as even that.It is full of talented actors - no doubt - yet, even each and every one of them cannot make this interesting. I do not mind 'over-the-top' Agatha Christie style movies. To that point, 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express' by Kenneth Branagh was highly entertaining. I cannot put the finger on why exactly THIS one does 'not work'.The only highlight is watching Ana de Armas on screen.

1023,CherryMarie9,What trash,1,6 March 2020,"I have no idea how this rating is so high. I assume it's only because of the star studded cast but what a ridiculous storyline. Murder Mystery is the exact same concept and it's a much better watch. A housekeeper who vomits every time she lies gets the inheritance of the man she's working for. There's such forced dialogue about politics that have nothing to do with the storyline, the ""Nazi troll"" bit was just unnecessary, and I say that as liberal black woman. It was just Incredibly disingenuous and patronising even. The whole storyline and reveal was just underwhelming and the obvious twist was basic.

1025,rminicoop,I must have seen a different movie than those leaving high reviews,5,30 December 2019,"This should have been a great movie.I'm not going to go through the plot, as it's covered here many times over. I'm going to highlight the glaring issues with the film instead.It's drawn out to the point that you almost don't care who did it, which is fine, because it's obvious who did it less than an hour in.Marta clearly says within 5 minutes of the dose the patient would be showing symptoms and sweating, but that doesn't happen. Harlan never shows any symptoms whatsoever, and we know Marta is there long enough for them to present. This gave away that she didn't OD him.Later on the film a person actually is given a fatal dose of the morphine around 8am (the same one that kills you in 10 minutes), but is magically alive at 10am when Marta arrives. 10 minutes =/= 2 hours. This was just incredibly lazy.If you think someone is a murderer why would you set a meeting with them in a dark abandoned building with no form of defense?Marta leaves her bag there daily, as were told. Why wouldn't Harlan just wrote a suicide note claiming he intentionally overdosed on morphine? Removes all the need for the whole mess if a sloppy cover up.Overall, this movie is fun to watch for a bit, but becomes tedious because it's so lazy and flawed.",Knives Out

1027,shaht-16429,Truly a masterpiece of subverting expectations.,9,30 November 2019,"Knives Out tells the story of the Thrombey's, an upper class family of wealth and importance celebrating the 85th birthday of the patriarch Harlan (Plummer), a day later Harlan is found with his throat slit and every one in the family, including the servants becomes a suspect, as they all have motive.It is very unique to see a murder mystery that is completely original, not a book adaptation nor a property of long standing fiction. These are original character in a pretty tired premise. When I walked into the theatre I was expecting this to play out like any old game of clue, or Sherlock, with Benoit Blanc (Craig) playing the eccentric private detective that puts every piece together in the end. However by deviating away from the traditional mystery formula, along with a great score and masterful/controlled camerawork, it really unravels its performances and characters in a funny and suspenseful way.This is a stellar cast, the two shining members being Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale the spoiled grandson of Harlan and Daniel Craig as the inconsiderate southern detective. Both of them are playing against their type are truly transformative in their roles. They were not James Bond or Captain America, they were two people trying to figure out how to solve the mystery looming above them. The supporting characters are also great, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield and Ana de Armas as the son-in law, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, crime scene investigator and Harlan's caretaker do not just blend into the movie as they have clear personalities and motives for what they want to do. However some of the cast do just disappear into the movie, particularly Katherine Langford and Jaeden Martell as the other two grandchildren.Given the movie's affinity for subverting expectations, it may render some plot points moot or unimportant at times. Knives Out is no exception, this movie would set up some plot points that would make the mystery loom and linger on, however when everything is revealed these plot points may not get the resolution they deserve. Also some characters really only exist for four or five lines/jokes and then are basically forgotten about by the end. However this might be because of the visual storytelling at the end. With the right context and clues, the audience can infer the real ending, based on nothing but facial expressions, prop treatment and setting displacement. This is how we know we have a true master of acting and directing, when an object is shown and it gives us much more can be deduced than just what is seen on screen.Without spoiling anything, don't go into this movie expecting a traditional murder mystery, the trailers really set it up to be one, but this is a Rian Johnson film. I understand why people were peeved at him for his treatment of Star Wars, mainly because his subversion of expectations made them mad, as people grew up with the characters and story, so in a sense they belong to the public and they didn't like the liberties he took with the new additions he made. But these characters and this story belong to him and he can do whatever he wants with them. In fact the less you know, the better. Expect some foul play.",Knives Out

1051,schmoab,Big miss by critics,6,4 December 2019,"This could've been a perfectly enjoyable 1h40m popcorn flick for the Christmas season. It would have been okay at its over 2 hour length, had it been sitting at 71% on the tomatometer. However it's at 97%, and I fell asleep during the slow part in act 2. After that, it picks up and becomes a decently satisfying comedy thriller. Chris Evans character really spices things up, and Michael Shannon finally gets to do that thing he does at his best. Daniel Craig's campy foghorn leghorn performance is so over the top, that they call it out to the audience. He was at least oddly entertaining. Ana who plays the main character is dressed way down to look average, but it's impossible to hide her beauty and charm. I wish her character had more depth. She ends up mostly being stand in for the audience, rather than an active participant in the story.There was a rather pedestrian twist at the end, which wasn't really. Everything plays out as expected. There are several overt political lines and issues in this movie. It's hard to know if Rian Johnson thought he was making a grand statement about classism in the United States. The politics just felt kind of tacked on to the kooky family mystery story.See it if you have time to kill. Just don't expect to be blown away.",Knives Out

Now I finally had a few hours to spare, and felt in the mood for a drama movie, so decided to give it a shot.It was absolutely worth it. Great acting alll around, and especially Daniel Craig did an amazing job.¨The whole story managed to move forward making it interesting all through the movie, and I never had that feeling of knowing how it would end, and several things did surprise me, which is exactly what I was hoping for.Anyone who likes murder mystery stories, shouldn't miss this one, now matter what feeling you might have for the director.I don't often review movies, only when a movie truly is a surprise, as I hope the rating and review, will help others to see it, and not miss it, as I almost did.It's the kind of movie you absolutely should see, knowing as little as possiple, so I'm not saying anything about it, other than great performance, good music, stellar camera work, and absolutely worth watching.",Knives Out

He would've died within that time frame if the medical explanation held true. BUT he didn't die... should he wait another while before ending his own life?

8/10🗡🚪💉💸""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways.",Knives Out

1059,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,Brilliant puzzle,8,6 August 2020,"The story is simple. The owner of a huge fortune is death and someone kill him , or was responsible for his death and the movie and the point is to find out who was the person.
This picture is tricky because he doesn't hide the problem. Basically the nurse got the fortune and she thinks that she was responsible for the death of the inicial owner and in cause that happen all the fortune would be took from her.
In my opinion this movie is great because although it give us prove that the nurse did it the picture has the class to make us doubt all the time and throughout the movie we have the feeling that everyone can be the killer.
The development of the characters is very well done and I want to enfatise the Daniel Craig,Chris Evans and Christopher Plummer performances. Everyone else in the cast are very good too giving the exactly or even more the feeling that the movie desires.
It's an excellent movie that I would recommend to everyone.
One quickly fun fact, if the movie was made in my country it would have only five minutes because the nurses can't benefit from the patient testament.",Knives Out
1060,tatbtsisb,"Really great, entertaining and fun movie!",9,30 December 2019,"Knives Out is one of the most entertaining movies of this year. It is funny, witty and suspenseful. My favourite things about this movie is the cast, production design and obviously the story.The cast was superb, Ana de Armas was super good in the movie but my favourite has to be Daniel Craig, especially with that weird Southern Accent. I thought it was weird at first, then I was quite used to it. Chris Evans also pushed his boundaries this time with his character and he did really well.This movie is shot really well, the light and colours are amazing and there are a variety of shots they used.The Production Design is the best about this movie, especially the house. That's one of the most beautiful houses I've probably ever actually seen. It feels luxurious and rich but also feels very homy and cozy, It doesn't feel unrealistic at all.The score really adds to the movie as well, giving it kind of a classic vibe. Like a fun murder mystery you see on TV when you were young which makes the whole concept of the story feels nostalgic.The story is gotta be the best thing about this movie. Rian Johnson made a simple story and turned it into a complex and astonishing story with charismatic characters that are very well written. As the movie goes, the more the plot thickens and it builds up. It is really worth the watch just for the plot itself.The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was some characters. You know they're there just for the laughs or as someone that you don't really know them and they come in just to kinda help with the plot. But other than that, everything is fine.Overall, this movie is really worth the watch. With great a great story, cast, cinemotagraphy and score. Knives Out is one of my favourites this year and definitely a 9/10 for me.",Knives Out
1061,FirstNameLastName24,"Not the best film of the year, but very entertaining and well-made",7,30 November 2019,"""Knives Out"" puts a new twist on the classic ""whodunnit"" mystery story. It is very entertaining and enjoyable, combining equal parts suspense and comedy. The dialogue is witty, the plot is (mostly) original, and the cast is superb. The
""Clue""-esque setting and characters are mostly enthralling. This film will satisfy most casual and hardcore moviegoers alike. However, ""Knives Out"" doesn't exactly break any new ground. It isn't revolutionary as a movie, or even as a mystery. It works hard to be unique, but stops just short of breaking away from similar films. Also, some political banter slightly taints the movie, but doesn't ruin it. All in all, ""Knives Out"" is definitely worth a watch, maybe even a re-watch with friends, but it fails to become one of the greats.",Knives Out
1062,RomeoKnight,Predictable but entertaining mystery romp,6,4 January 2020,"A guy got killed. Who's the guilty one? Hmm, pretty obvious from the get go but lets watch... Actor list at least is filled with semi-famous names. Some of them play their roles routinely well, some overact. Especially Craig's accent was ridiculous and goofballing doesn't fit his persona at all. Plummer was solid and it was nice to see Don Johnson too. Rest were okay.The film had ""humorous"" tone with it which was completely unnecessary. Comedy is hard and clearly it missed the mark in this one. Not just me, but the whole theatre audience laughed perhaps once. Barfing main protagonist immigrant lady wasn't funny at all and belonged to b-class family movie. Craig acting as a goofball detective was another miss (I like him nonetheless). Rest of the small ""comedy"" bits were all somewhat off. Just do full comedy if you intend to do so, and not half arsed like this which just gets on the way of otherwise decent movie.The plot wasn't very original, been there, seen that, but it kept the movie going. At least to me there were practically no ""twists"" in the plot. I expected more and something original. What else? One thing to mention (scriptwriter thought to be funny?) is the under-aged boy who's been called as a ""nazi"" because of his political views. Twice, with no remorse. Sounds pretty familiar at these times doesn't it? Not cool.Knives out has a stupid name but nonetheless is quite good representative of ""murder mystery"" genre movie. There was pro-feminist Star Wars, Frozen 2, and this running in theatres. I chose this and was pretty happy about it.",Knives Out

There were way too many convenient plot devices that made it seem a little contrived. I think the whole thing fell apart at the end when to me it stopped being believable and turned a little silly.Rian Johnson is probably one of the most politically correct filmmakers in Hollywood right now and I think that greatly limits the effectiveness of his movies because of the rules he sets for himself. I think there were a lot of good opportunities squandered in Knives Out. There were some very interesting characters that were wasted in the favor of the story being focused on a very bland albeit pretty one. For me it just ultimately didn't deliver a satisfying experience, mostly entertaining but forgettable. 6/10",Knives Out

Some details are very interesting - the birthday cake serving scene (everybody thought they were the closest people to their father), the coffee cup, and etc. The plot is fascinating, and the ending is unexpected.

Over the years, various versions of Marple, Poirot, Holmes, etc have been a bit of a mishmash. Some very good, some acceptable, and some that really gall. I was dubious about this one - Modern, Daniel Craig as a PI (!), and likely some moronic script with either gaping holes in the plot or an obvious murderer in 5 minutes. Well, I give it big thumbs up! It's a good plot, a good bunch of characters, and the story flows well. It really is a good modern take on the genre. I think for those that like the Agatha Christie screen versions (I never liked the books) you will enjoy it - it's refreshingly very good. For those that don't like the Agatha Christie I think you will like it because it has extra humour and feels modern. Get past Daniel Craigs accent and enjoy :)",Knives Out

I have not seen Looper because it's rated R and I don't watch R rated but I seen The Brothers Bloom. Rian Johnson is a good filmmaker. Anyways, the screenplay was really well written with a smart and fiendish plot. The acting from the cast was really good, especially from Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas. Daniel Craig had a similar funny Southern accent like Logan Lucky. The humor is really quirky and sly, as well as funny. The directing from Rian Johnson is very stylish. The mystery throughout the movie will leave you guessing until the twist at the end and is very different from other murder mysteries.

1070,HarCarmichael,One of My Top 3 Favorite Movies of 2019,9,11 January 2020,"When I went to watch this, my expectations were not only somewhat low, but also confused. I wasn't sure if I was getting a 'Clue' remake or some overhyped movie from the critical acclaim this movie had gotten, and I just couldn't make out exactly the style and premise it would possess, or contain.So I go into it and just relax, sit back and see what it's about. At first, it is sort of like a mix of quirky kind of humor with what appears to be a legit murder mystery, but nothing along the lines of 'Clue'. This was a lot different than that; there's no ""Colonel Mustard with the Lead Pipe in the Kitchen"" type of innuendo.But then the story begins to rapidly pick up steam with interesting writing, good acting, and a vibe that has you always on edge as to trying to figure out exactly what is going on.What I really enjoyed the most was how it got more and more humorous and became a comedy more and more as it went on. Some people may find this silly, especially if they had expectations of a serious ""whodunnit"", but for me personally, it was just exactly the kind of movie I needed. Some quirky scenes and details really hit my funny bone, and then combine that with a lot of fun and funny political banter and silly lines and characters, and this ended up being one of my personal favorite movies of the year.Fortunately, it will be nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, even though it's more along the lines of a comedy and fun movie than something serious, which is refreshing. Not all art and all films that get award recognition need to be serious dramas or biopics.",Knives Out

It was only a matter if there wasn't anything better out there (because they are all pretty good), and then came along Knives Out.The only way this doesn't win is if the lighthearted humorous and quirky vibe turn some voters off compared to the seriousness and pretentiousness of the aforementioned movies.

Give me a break. Maybe writer/director Rian Johnson was trying to give some cultural context to the picture, but unfortunately the culture he is reflecting is his Kalifornia leftist echo chamber.
Aside from the distractive injection of immigration open borders advocacy, the film is a competent ensemble mystery comedy, easy on the comedy. In fact, if you aren't really looking for it, you may miss the humor, it is so innocuous and low-key, pretty much reflecting the state of comedy in America these days. Mustn't offend anybody with our humor, except of course rich white conservatives, who have no feelings, being pure evil.
The identity of the killer (who is of course rich and white) is kept well hidden for 95% of the running time, and for that, I give Knives Out 5 stars. It would have merited perhaps 7 stars, had Rian Johnson taken a few more chances in the comedy department, and withheld his dopey open immigration politics.",Knives Out

Storyline and the way everything was produced and directed was very well done. In a way, it had a dry sense of humor through lots of family arguments and ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" Daniel Craig, but it was enjoyable to watch. Daniel Craig did a great job in this role, his accent was good but through the way he played his role, he made you seem that this guy was an incredibly smart investigator, then in the next scene you think, this guy may actually be an idiot, what is he doing. Right from the beginning you know this whole movie was about mystery, and in a way it was slow to begin with, but they were just laying down the lines for the story and trying to make the audience make conclusion about who did it. It was in a way predictable, having a big reveal in the end with Daniel Craig explaining every small movement that the murderer took in his actions and trying to cover himself up. But overall an entertaining movie that was suspenseful and made the audience draw conclusions about characters.

Yeah I've seen a few, and they didn't deserve their score, while some were ok.Okay there's Bollywood movies too, but I feel they get higher rating than deserved also because India is a massive (and growing) country, and Indians vote their native movies. National pride sort of thingBUT this movie. Good old style story telling, a real whodunnit, with humor and some social commentary sprinkled on top. But the main emphasis is on the Agatha Christie style murder mystery. It's like playing the boardgame Clue, trying to figure out the killer, but in movie form. Great entertainment, so well written.Only thing I didn't like was Daniel Craig's accent, I mean it was a bit overdone. Everyone else seemed realistic, and this character seemed like a caricature. I like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and bunch of other films. His acting was good here too, but I wish he just did his natural accent.SPOILERS AHEAD:Small other criticism, I did find the ending a bit implausible, even an experienced nurse would check the labels when the stuff she's giving is potentially lethal. And not just trust the hand-feel of the liquids. Besides, how different can two bottles of liquid really feel, if their size and amount of liquid is the same?SPOILERS ENDAnyway, it was a small thing... otherwise one of best movies I've seen in many years.

After a week two detectives and private investigator, Benoit Blanc are hired to unravel this murder mystery.What makes this Whodunnit work is Johnson's holy original take on the genre. The first and third act are told in a familiar way. However the second act has a very unique turn to it, as the audience gets a lot of information that is usually revealed much later.As far as concerns, there aren't that many. There were a few side characters that felt a little unnecessary to the plot and the movie shares a lot of its big reveals through (needed) exposition.Aside from that, Johnson has written and directed a beautiful and original vision to the genre. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys crime thrillers or to someone who knows to appreciate a compelling story.",Knives Out

1101,aashray-61866,Bloody brilliant,10,24 June 2020,Rian Johnson has made an absolutely brilliant Comedy/Crime movie here. Will always remain as nothing less than one of my all time favourite movies. The way he weaves the comedy into the plot is truly brilliant. The acting is terrific. Well done good sir.,Knives Out
1102,hughchilles,Good movie,7,12 August 2021,"Pretty good movie, I expected it to be a closed room sort of whodunnit and it becomes quickly apparent that it is not that, it's a movie I could watch again to see how it all went down. It had moments of confusion and lost tension but overall pretty good. The best thing about it was it's actor's performances.",Knives Out
1103,goddangwatir,Terrific mystery movie,8,7 January 2020,"Knives Out is the latest movie of Rian Johnson, and boy does he deliver ! A spiffing screenplay combined with an excellent cast and sly editing makes for an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller which will keep you guessing. Fans of comedy will not be disappointed either, with many subtle yet funny jokes sprinkled all over the movie.The driving forces behind this captivating whodunnit are none other than Ana de Armas as the likable and compassionate caretaker Martha Cabrera, and Daniel Craig as the slick and bit enigmatic detective Benoit Blanc. The latter I would dare say is maybe even worthy of an Academy Award, even though his manufactured southern accent is at first a bit off-putting. The entertainment value and intriguingness of the movie makes sure that quickly becomes a problem of the past however.All in all, Knives Out is a excellent murder mystery which delivers many curveballs. I highly recommended it for ordinary moviegoers and I believe it is a true must see for fans of the mystery genre !8/10",Knives Out

The cast did as excellent if a job as you would expect when you first see the lineup. There are also a handful of well-timed comedic moments too which I appreciated.The big reveal at the end could've been MORE in my opinion, but it was still all well written, explained, and portrayed.

The all-star cast delivered a very entertaining film that gave us a great homage to one of my favorite literary authors Agatha Christie, yet managed to deliver an original and exciting entry to the genra.

1116,OdinsRagnarok,"Not bad dumb entertainment, but not a clever crime story",6,27 February 2020,"It's a fun enough movie to sit through for some casual entertainment, but don't go into the movie expecting a clever crime / mystery story. The ""culprit"" is revealed way too early, making me expect there was more to it, which it hardly was. The rest of the ""reveal"", isn't much and is obvious at the point it's being revealed. If you have ever read a good crime mystery novel, it will leave you disappointed.The acting overall is fine. But Daniel Craig's southern accent is terrible, he should have stuck to speaking British accent. It wouldn't have hurt the plot or movie. But I guess Ryan was subverting our expectations on that one.There are a bit too much underline throughout the movie as well. Not gonna spoil anything, but it's jarring scenes that only a woke person could ever believe would be a realistic line of dialogue or portray of character. Immigrant worker good! Rich people bad!",Knives Out
1117,dogacol,Issues with Marta,4,7 February 2020,"I have no problems with the plot, even though it is overly simplified to the point of cartoonish as many have pointed out.I have a problem with the character Marta. For a character that is supposed to be the ideal ""good"" she is certainly not and Rian Johnson does not understand what ""good"" is. An entirely ""good"" character would have to do good to be considered even close to being good. Marta does nothing of the sort. She plays the game Harlan's way (no matter what Blanc says), she tries to do everything the way Harlan wants even though she knows what she is doing is wrong and that is not the doings of a ""good person."" Her character is supposed to be an angel who is the only truthful person around, who can't even lie without puking. But, she does lie and hide her puking. She also actively, willingly hides the truth till the end. If she were a perfectly good character, then she would not have hidden the truth, going to great lengths.The writer does not understand that there is no difference between actively hiding the truth and lying. Marta is a selfish person who looks for her or her family's benefit. If there is self-interest, there can be no ""good."" If there is ""good,"" there can be no self-interest. There is no difference between the Thrombey's looking out for their own and Marta looking out for her own. If one should be considered ""bad"" than the other is as well. And this is the case. This is why screenwriters should seek help from advisors of ethics when they try to write stories that make judgements about such subjects.",Knives Out
1118,didkus,Should only work for people who haven't seen anything in the genre,3,11 January 2020,"I want to start by saying that I live for crime mysteries so I am 100% in the target audience. I'm quite familiar with the genre and I love everything in it by default.However, this movie had too many flaws and I can't understand how it has such a high score. My only guess is that most of the people who voted are incredibly unfamiliar with the genre and don't have a reference point.Anyway, let's get to the chase. For a crime mystery it's incredibly important to get the audience to ask the right questions. There have to be very few very clear and interesting questions. And this is the most important thing the movie does not get right. The questions change all the time, they are too many, they are unclear, too simple, some too easy to figure out anyway. And we have this issue both in regards to the plot and to the characters. So the mystery part is done incredibly poorly.The crime part is almost OK but a lot of the time it's all over the place. We didn't get a proper view of the picture in regards to the crime that took place. What exactly was done and how, what the police see as being suspicious and why, dissection of the motives of the characters and, you know, and actual investigation. It would have been fine if it wasn't such a crucial part of the story and if at least the mystery or the drama was very good.So, next on the list is the drama. This is the only genre that actually has something to offer here. Trying to work with the characters' differences in moral stances and ethics was a very good idea, unfortunately this part of the script was in embryonic state. I believe that if they went with that as their main guiding line and main genre the movie could have been very good.Lastly, if you go in expecting comedy... I hope you will be able to see any. It is beyond me how this is even listed as a genre here. The movie is light and easy to digest but that's not really comedy.Other general notes:1. Casting was fine but I have no idea what they were even trying to do with the Daniel Craig character. In the beginning I needed quite some time just to get used to him and for the rest of the movie he was below average. I admit, I truly can't even guess their intentions there. Other than that I found the casting and acting to be enjoyable.2. I found the music to be just as messy as the story and the mix of genres. I am sympathetic because it must have been really difficult to figure out what the movie is supposed to be and therefore how to make the soundtrack.3. I would really like to say something good or that I would recommend it anyway to people who haven't seen anything of the genre at least, unfortunately I just can't do that. It felt undercooked and messy. I would not watch any sequels they decide to make. Any British crime movie or TV show is a hundred times better in all aspects so why waste my time.I hope this is not where detective movies are headed. First Kenneth Branagh and now this... There are plenty of people who know how to make these movies right, just give them a chance, Hollywood!",Knives Out

If this would be tge normal standard of detectives, I would love it!Slowly the movie starts spinning up, soon enough you will be drawn into this movie, with great and humorous dialogues. And slowly the story unfolds. Very natural acting and great directors work.

1129,vladhxh,Deeply disappointing,3,23 August 2021,"I don't know who writes all the rave reviews -- this movie was extremely disappointing. The setup is all good -- it's an Agatha Christie-esque story, down to the strange and quirky characters, there is a sense of a mystery and you expect something clever and fun, like the old times. However, the movie goes in a totally different direction by replacing a good whodunnit setup with a post-modern take, as if the makers of the movie are saying - yes, we know that a genuine detective mystery story is impossible to pull off in the 21st century, so we won't even bother. There is no mystery, the most obvious explanation is the real explanation, so just enjoy this pseudo-mystery for the visuals and A-list actors having a romp plus a lovely Ana de Armas who was made as plain looking as possible. Isn't it funny and clever? Well, no. It's at best a Pink Panther remake without the gags.I personally don't think that the movie is better for not having a good twisty plot, and I don't think that it's impossible to create an enjoyable and engaging whodunnit in the 21st century. You should have at least tried, then it might have been a good movie. As it stands, it's not really great entertainment, and I have no idea what made many people like it, there are much smarter and much more entertaining movies out there.",Knives Out

What the hell is that garbage? It is grating on the ears every time he speaks! Either they should have cast someone else or should have let him speak normally.

Whoever that was is easily overwhelmed. It dragged in the beginning, it took a long time to go anywhere.The pacing was very slow on and off. The acting was generally mediocre. Christopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey, a mystery author, was very good. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private investigator, had an awful forced accent that never, ever ended. He was trying to channel Frank Underwood and missed. It should have been a great ensemble movie, sadly it was not. It fell flat.I love classic mysteries. An important part of a whodunnit is pacing. The actual killer wasn't a surprise, the full details of the manner of death were more boring than thrilling. This movie never got to classic mystery status. I don't think the movie knew if it wanted to be classic like Agatha Christie or quirky like Casino Royale.If I can think of anything good it is particular parts of the house and some statues that are related to Harlan Thrombey's mysteries. A piece of furniture and action scene at the end was very well done.I could have skipped this movie, but was drawn in by clever editing in the trailer and some over the top reviews that do not match what I saw.",Knives Out
1152,greenlarry,A fun outing for Craig,8,4 August 2020,"Strangely enjoyable for the type of film I don't normally enjoy, the whodunnit. Daniel Craig as an American is quite convincing. One of the characters refers to him as foghorn leghorn which was funny",Knives Out

I was a little unsure of it going in but was pleasantly surprised.The acting was amazing, helped in large part to its outstanding cast. One glance at the cast list is enough to convince most to give this movie a shot.Its biggest downside is that once you have seen it once there really isn't much incentive to see it again as the surprise is over with. Its definitely worth watching though and I recommend it to everyone.",Knives Out
1155,SadDevilExperience,A Lesson in Advertising,8,24 March 2020,"Never have I ever been so caught by surprise by a movie that I thought would be above average at best. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be a typical 'whodunit' Clue-styled movie, but there was so much more! All the ads I saw hinted at that. Almost a quarter way into the movie, it turned out to be anything but. Every time I thought I knew the direction this movie was going in, I ended up being wrong. That's at the epicenter of the movie: the surprises. They always have a good set up and the punchline is satisfying. The dialogue was a little cheesy but for the most part, it was well-written and the characters were all very interesting. I could've done without the politics in this movie, but I can forgive it because it at least had some clever commentary and there was the occasional political joke that landed. In addition, the cinematography is colorful and had some creative shots. I especially enjoyed the last frame, as if to destroy any uncertainty the viewers have about where everyone goes from here. The actors were also great in this movie, and how could it not be with an all-star cast? I will say, it was very interesting to see Daniel Craig pull off a Frank Underwood kind of accent. I almost half expected him to start talking to us about his deep and inner thoughts. But like I said before, this movie really made me reconsider the way movies advertise: because they didn't give away the big reveal(s), it made the movie all the more enjoyable. Far too often, I watch movie trailers that basically reveal the entire plot, including the twist. What's the fun in that? Knives Out was advertised in a way that not only the twists would be fresh, but that the comedy would be fresh because I got quite a few laughs out of this. Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for its sharp humor and cutting story (puns intended).",Knives Out
1156,angel-soha,An attempt to murder mystery,6,28 March 2021,Overrated and overhyped... Great acting by Daniel craig and a total wastage of captain America chris Evans...

Not a typical murder mystery but how someone attempts to murder a person and infact he commits suicide rather...

First of all, there was only good character development for a couple characters and the rest didn't really do much of anything, such as Jamie Lee Curtis' character. Second off, the type of humor is mostly similar to Wes Anderson movies, where you think to yourself ""hmm that was funny"", but rarely laugh, which explains why it's rated so high... people thinking they got the humor that others didn't, which isn't the case.At least it had a few funny scenes, though, and some fairly clever parts and also very good acting.

The story is fantastic, the tensions in the scenes are fabulous, the acting, the direction blah blah...everything is to the mark. Like every detective movie we get to feel that the suspect is this, that etc but the twist makes us flattered.
The plot is simple but kept hidden very cleverly till the end.
We love Daniel Craig here. Every time he comes to the house there's a spark in the scenes. His accent is very nice to hear as detective blanc.

By the time the entire plot was revealed, I was literally sitting on the edge of my nice comfy leather chair. I was right on some things, but those theories were often put into question until the end. I also found myself rooting for certain characters as well. Highly entertaining and well done.

The film looks like it was shot on film, but it was actually filmed on digital but they did a great job with giving it that look. The colors in the sets and wardrobe pop of the screen.

The film has one of the best casts of characters in a recent movie thanks to the brilliant and witty writing and the fantastic performances by all the lead actors, but it manages to tell a story which seems simple at first, but quickly evolves into a thrilling and engaging plot where every scene throws a curve ball that makes you question everything you suspect about the characters and what they have done.",Knives Out

Craig's character jumps to conclusions easily, the members of the family are full of stereotypes, the plot twists are somehow predictable.It is a good try, but if they want to make a franchise with Craig's character, they have to try more.",Knives Out
1174,sheppard-2,An ok mystery with a typical Agatha Christie plot and a social allegory,7,31 May 2020,"Great cast of actors who play in full strength. Decorations beyond perfect. The plot is a typical Agatha Christie mystery, which makes it quite predictable. It's done in a mocking post modern manner though, with a Colombo-style private detective, which makes it quite fun to watch. The ending is sort of weak, but that's only if you are watching it as a mystery movie. Also, the visual style is very much a TV movie, which doesn't make it greater.
So, on the social allegory side... The movie still lacks some depth. It gives a few powerful blows, one of which is the very ending scene. But the allegory is not perfect. How should I describe this aspect of the movie without spoilers? Let's say it is about the white guilt and oppressed minorities that are about to take the power. What will they do with their new power? Every character symbolizes a social group. One weak point is the minority is heavily underrepresented and only shown from one aspect. Shortly speaking, she's too good to be true.
I find this strange about this movie: it has a very high score, and the people seem to only praise its mystery side, which is actually a joke. And the social allegory side, which is the stronger side of the movie, is hardly even mentioned in the reviews. Though I still cannot give it a very high score.",Knives Out
1175,bohemianrh,Not all that good,6,10 January 2020,"Solid entertainment. I was kept pretty much interested for two hours. I really liked the first one-third: the mix of characters, their personalities and backstories, the beautiful house and detailed interior decor.Then came the girl who vomits if she lies (frankly ... ew). One expects things to get really good from here - this could be a special ability that helps our detective piece together the mystery. Except it is quickly revealed that there is no mystery and the whole case, motivation process and outcome, is played out in front of the audience before the movie is half through. What?I held out hope when the morphine overdose was revealed. No throat has been slit, so surely, something is left to solve. Nope. Turns out to be wholly a suicide. We realize everything before this is kind of useless, and follow the main character on her quest to escape culpability (except I did think she was at fault and should be caught, so was not really convinced).The middle section meanders and loses itself in inheritance drama. A blackmailer appears - is murdered. I frankly could not figure out if the second murder was done to hurt or help the main character - could be either and I did not much care. Only wanted to see the ending where I was sure there is a twist.The last part of the movie picked up and was almost as good as the first, although the denouement was somewhat predictable (many plot points follow so much hinting as to make them predictable, even if they were not at the start). The black sheep turns out to be ... really the black sheep, I had high hopes that the most like grandson to the grandfather would continue to foster the family's special bond to the main character, nope that was all false. Also: overused motifs of the game Go, being a good person, seeing through if knives are props, etc.Final note on what I perceive to be the misplaced idea of guilt in this movie. Main character did not directly kill the grandpa but did indirectly cause his misguided suicide. In a civil lawsuit, would she not still be held accountable (somewhat) for his death? So the slayer's rule would still work? Consider also the case for her negligence and that she had champagne.And in the alternate scenario, even if she was the one to administer what she thought was medicine (actually morphine), she would not be held guilty if it's proven someone swapped out the drugs? (which is possible given the eye witness of the housekeeper).It is tragic that the old man must die either way. Overall, pretty good/not bad, really good performances by the cast, less than solid plot (if it were more of a comedy it would have worked - alas), too much vomiting, and too indulgent towards the main character who at best I think is a neutral not morally superior person.",Knives Out

However, it does greatly skimp on plot.Pretty much, I'm sure the writer has read a large number of mystery novels. Conversely, the writer could not write a mystery novel of comparable value.This movie was neither clever nor intelligent. Granted, it was entertaining and fun, but it truly lacked anything but noir.There wasn't a single character introduced, or an element, or a""clue"" that I didn't understand the significance of at the moment. I kept waiting for a clever plot twist, or a mind blowing reveal, but those things never occur. in the end, I pretty much have things figured out as I had figured they would be figured out from the very beginning. I found myself growing impatient for the reveal because I just wanted to leave. I already knew how it ended.That being said, at least there was a general attempt at a clever movie.

While Daniel Craig plays himself again, Ana de Armas' character vomits when he lies. I cannot understand how big names like Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson are involved. However, as an actor you never know what the film will look like in the end. Even if the script initially seems interesting. Still, it was Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson who were the only ones that stood out. I didn't understand the role of the newcomer, Jaeden Martell, (which you know from the IT Remake) at all. He had almost no sentence and just stared at a cell phone the entire time. Very weak and unimaginative. Captain America, aka Chris Evans was ok. Nevertheless, the film manages to smile from time to time and feels a little entertained. However, I didn't feel captivated by the film. The Star Wars 8 director who wrote the film and was a director himself definitely needs practice. It wasn't a really bad movie, but definitely not a good one either. Very superficial.",Knives Out

Written, directed, and produced by Rian Johnson, all of our expectations were subverted in this picture with a nice little twist at the end. What a ride.

The vertict it's by far a brilant film just ok ! Really that's what l felt a ok film nothing to ride home about ! As for Jamie Lee Curtis & Toni Collette l felt they didn't have or get much to do in this film . Don Johnson also appears in this film & is fine in his role for what it's worth . Other actors role get larger in the later part of the movie ! We also have a young actor whom is the lead actor among actors who have been around for quite a while in TV & Film .

He needs to stick to his own accent. It almost ruined the movie for me. That said, it was a good story, nice twist, and otherwise very entertaining, thus the seven stars.

Great classic representation of the murder mystery genre, with theatrical characterisation and art direction.My only call-out here is the timing of the stage-gates of revelation. We know far too much too early about the nurse and see far too little about the juicy suspect motivations which remain underexplored before the main plot is revealed. There was far too little left to presume halfway through the timeline which led me to conclude the answer before the question had time to ferment.Al in all, this is a fun flick.

1219,fudanchu-725-268123,Masterpiece,10,27 November 2019,"SPOILERS...Saying anything about Knives Out risks being a spoiler, including saying that ""saying anything about Knives Out risks being a spoiler."" So don't read anything about it before your first viewing.Here I will say just a few words, focusing on one significant aspect of Knives Out which is an extraordinarily entertaining and clever film.What recent films can Knives Out be compared to? Coincidentally (and I think it is coincidentally but remarkably) it is Get Out. Get Out took horror film ideas and played them masterfully, but also made us uncomfortable by using them to look at ourselves. Get Out definitely changed how I saw the world, and I hope it changed how I behaved as well.Knives Out similarly draws attention to how we interact with those less well off than us. It begins in the home of a rich family, with a wealthy author who has really produced something of worth, and his no-good family who have coasted on his wealth but believe they are deserving of that wealth. There are two servants, forgettable people who float around in the background and are sometimes very patronisingly treated as ""friends"". The similarity between the treatment of these two, and the treatment of the boyfriend in Get Out is striking. You no doubt remember ""I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could"", In Knives Out you have ""I thought you should have come to the funeral, but I was outvoted"". This line is funny, but it is powerful too. It shows how even when the servants are treated as friends, they are ""servant friends"", they are dependent on us (we hope) and so we can interact with them when we want, we can throw them a few minor rewards (a joint, an offer of a stipend) and they will keep running back to us.I live in Europe now but have lived many years in the USA and this treatment of servants, meaning immigrants who are extremely dependent on us, is precisely as depicted in Knives Out. (Europeans do this too, but this is an American film). By no means is this anthropological precision the main source of interest for Knives Out, but it intrigued me how well Rian Johnson (really a genius) was able to capture this aspect of American life. And, as you will see, it is very important to the film. It can be appreciated for the first time without observing any of this, but it becomes much richer once you do.It is noteworthy that Sleuth, one predecessor of Knives Out that is perhaps its equal was also deeply concerned with class and entitlement.I think Knives Out is a masterpiece.",Knives Out
1220,edhart08,"UTTER, PATHETIC RUBBISH.",1,26 November 2019,Daniel Craig and Toni Collette must be laughing all the way to the Bank. I saw this piece of rubbish tonight in Sydney with two friends. They both dozed off to sleep during this tedious nonsense. I can't believe some of the Actors putting their names to this. DON'T BOTHER !!,Knives Out
1221,acole0228,Good Old Whodunnit,8,15 December 2019,"On the surface Knives Out is a whodunnit murder mystery, but beneath is a subtle examination and critique of wealth acquired through family legacy in the form of the Thrombey family. While neither are necessary reinventing the wheel, both are compelling. The murder mystery is fun, unpredictable and humorous. At the center of it is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private detective hired anonymously under suspicious circumstances and Ana de Armas as the nurse and friend of the deceased Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). This movie isn't just interested in the mystery but in the characters that are caught up in the suspicious death of Mr. Harlan Thrombey, who by chance has just cut off the family from his money, legacy, and inheritance. The one scene that stood out in this film to me was about halfway through, where Michael Shannon's character, one of Harlan's sons, weakly attempts to extort Ana de Armas' character into giving up the inheritance gifted to her. It's a scummy move, but it's given nuance coming from someone who has just lost his father and left out of a substantial inheritance he was expected to receive for a number of years. Rian Johnson, like all good filmmakers (he also wrote the excellent script), realizes that good characters are the centerpiece of a good movie. All together this is an excellent movie, and I should mention again that it is also very funny.",Knives Out
1222,goshamorrell,Plummers demeantor has added to another film.,10,26 May 2021,"I've always adored crime, and mystery films with an amazing cast, and screenplay. Knives Out was nominated for best original screenplay at the 2020 oscars. This film will keep you guessing till you're on the edge of your seat. Murder can modivate anyone do to anything for money, power or to blame it on someone elese, and you can't even trust your own family sometimes if money is involved.When a well known crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death. Knives out takes place in Wellesley, Massachusetts. The main characters are Benoit Blanc, Ransom Drysdale, Marta Cabrera, Linda Drysdale, Walt Drysdale, Richard Drysdale, Joni Thrombey, and Hareln Thrombey. This story is about a writer that was murdered and a detective Blanc is payed to figure the murder out, and it might be someone you don't suspect.The acting in this crime comedy movie blew me away because most of the actors have never acted with each other before, and some have acted together. Daniel Craig did an adequate job playing a whole different role than James Bond, and his southern accent made the character even better and unique from the other roles and characters that Craig has done. You normally would see Chris Evans in a marvel film, but no Chris Evans plays in this crime comedy film, and really takes his talent to another level, with comedy, and being serious in a crime that's a comedy, andc nails the part and the character. Jamie Lee Curtis is in alot of films back in the day, seeing her in Knives Out gave me even more respect for her because Curtis plays Linda Drysdale and her performance really moved and changed how I looked at Knives out. There were many scenes that I saw that Jamie wasn't acting, like when she was reading one of her fathers letters and just teared up, and when the will reading was and she just cussed out Marta because she felt that she stole everything from their family. Don Johnson has been in alot of classic stuff like Miami Vice, A boy and his Dog, Django Unchained. But I never saw him play as well as he did in Knives out. Johnson got right into his part and acted astonishing and was the character that spoke his mind and opinions and didn't care what anyone else thought, and his character had a lot of depth to the story and mood of the movie. Last for best, Christopher Plummer played a well known mystery writer, Harlan Thrombey. Plummers unique candian voice and his vocalability to deliver such an bewitching performance, one of his last movies. Plummer took his many decades of experience and added it to the character, and made Knives out what it is today.Things that I loved about Knives out was the cast, screenplay, soundtrack, the sets, and the beautiful mansion they used. They made a masterpiece that other generations will need to see and watch over and over. Many people went to watch Knives out in theaters or at home and don't realize how rare a film like this turns out so well, and gets 2 more sequels planned within 2 years of coming out. Another thing I loved about Knives out is how Plummer always gave a loving and caring look to each actor he acted with, and worked with. That's why this film has a tone of love, caring, and beautifully acted. One scene that really stood out to me was the scene where Harlan wants Marta to have the entire fortune because she was the only one that didn't want anything from his death or from him, and never asked once for money.The lessons I learned was to pay attention and listen to the words the people in your life use. Notice how they are spending their time, or their money. Every single choice a person makes can show you something about what is going on with them. Second Know your worth, Your paycheck doesn't define you. Your clothing size doesn't define you. Your productivity doesn't define you. Know who you are, and insist on your value.The group of people that would enjoy Knives out is any age group. I would recommend to anyone that loves a good mystery film or likes to figure out hard movies that don't tell you who did it till the end. The rating was PG-13 for thematic elements including brief violence, some strong language, sexual references, and drug material. This film is a beautiful masterpiece in film making. Go watch it, and watch it with a careful eye.I give this film 5 stars out of 5 stars.From Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi to Knives out Director Ryan Johnson has made many different films. A southern fried P. I. Daniel Craig plays in the hit Knives out as the P. I. Detective Blanc to figure out and solve the murder of a 84 year old dead mystery writer Harylan Thrombey. As he interviews and watches the family, Blanc finds out what the family's true actions and motives are, but one of them. Through the entire of the film each family member will lose something they want to dear, but one member will get it all, and who will it be?",Knives Out

It was so painfully slow throughout, by the middle of the movie, I was thinking this is either gonna end like the usual suspect or dumb and dumber. It became clear after the lawyer read the will. I mean, think about it, even before the sweet and caring Marta can gain control of the assets, she has to clear a lot of hurdles. The family members can file for a court injunction, sue her for wrongful death, undue influence and theft. If she's really lucky, she wins every legal battle and gets to run a small company, but does she understand corporate accounting and intellectual property laws? If she's less lucky, she gets to settle all the lawsuits by selling or giving away all the assets to the circling sharks. If she's out of luck, she'll be incarcerated and tried for murder.

There's no impossible coincidence, impossibly-clever mastermind, incredible timing or other deus ex machina tropes.Daniel Craig is also superb. His pompous Benoit Blanc detective, with his peculiar accent and mannerisms is really a better Hercule Poirot than Kenneth Branagh's actual Porot in the Orient Express, which was a caricature.Above all, this appears to a film everyone involved really enjoyed making it.In this age of superheroes and explosions and mindless action, Knives Out stands out.

It's very beautiful. But the acting is ridiculously one dimensional and boring.

1251,Nolg101,Wonderfully colorful story with entertainment for the whole family!,9,2 March 2020,"Meet the Thrombey's... Although pretty late to the party, I was just on time to catch this hilarious, who-done-it mystery movie before it slipped out of theaters and I was totally impressed. Having been exposed to various members of this ensemble cast at some point in their careers I was excited to see how they would be able to co-exist onscreen as an acting family unit.The accomplished and versatile ensemble cast is one of the many reasons to see this, with Toni Collette, who left so many speechless with her performance in Hereditary, or Katherine Langford who played the vitally important role of Leah in Love Simon, to veteran actors Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon, the film seems to have the right actors to carry the story along. Most people will have seen Daniel Craig act in his many roles as James Bond over the years, but they will be in for a pleasant surprise at his ability to play a quirky detective with a southern drawl and a penchant for finding the truth, no matter where it may lead him. Audiences will too have seen Chris Evans play Captain America in his many appearances in those movies of the Marvel Cinema Universe, but they will again be perturbed and flummoxed at the impressive quality with which Evans' is able to bring his character in Knives Out, Ransom, to life.Director Rian Johnson hosted a 23 minute video with Vanity Fair where he broke down a scene in the film, which is highly worth seeing (Before or after viewing, no spoilers!), in it he offers his insight into how the scene was setup from where the cameras were being pointed, to how it was working with all of the talent, to the behind the scenes ""movie magic"" that we don't get to see. It was fantastic to see how excited he was about explaining some of the minute details of what went into making Knives Out, which in turn allowed for more of his voice to come out and be evident when watching the film. He really is an exceptional director, who we should expect more big things from in the future.Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera, has to be mentioned here, not only because she's the leading actress of the movie, but because she steals the show despite being listed third on the movie's first billed cast list. Although, she occupies a substantial amount of screen time Armas uses many subtle acting skills to bring power and depth to her role, which is important to the development of the films story.Like the above poster shows, Knives Out is a robust, dynamic multi-genre movie that has something for everybody. I saw ""multi-genre"" because it's not just a drama, it has too many comedic elements to be pigeonholed into solely that category. Additionally, it's not exclusively a thriller or mystery movie, because at it's core it's truly a family ""dram-edy"" about a mysterious, thrilling event that happens to the family..

From beginning to end you'll be guessing what could possibly come next? WHICH person is really telling these truth? Are all the detectives on the level? Why DID this once get hired? HE doesn't really know...UNTIL! I'd best describe it as ""Agatha Christie Lite"". Just for fun.

The cinematography is gorgeous, the dialogue snappy, the editing engaging. But it all fell apart once the first twist is revealed and Rian Johnson starts getting self indulgent.I really don't like that he likes to have meta lines about how stupid his writing decisions are as if that justifies them. For example, we get the most borning car chase in cinema and when it's over one character says ""that has to be the dumbest car chase I've ever seen"". Seriously, I'm not even kidding. The detective sounds like a Foghorn Leghorn parody and they point it out at the end of the movie as if that makes it any less ridiculous! The writing gets flat out stupid at times because Rian Johnson is a moron. There's a scene where the detective claims that the case is like a doughnut with a hole that needs to be filled by a doughnut hole. No, I'm not kidding. Rian Johnson is this stupid! Our lead character can't lie or else she vomits uncontrollably. No, that's not from a Simpson's episode, it's from the latest Rian Johnson picture.I was at a sold out showing and more people clapped at the end of the Dora the Explorer movie!

1270,engmahmoudmoussa,A funny clever interesting story to watch,9,14 December 2019,"The movie is very intelligent
I liked every part of the movie , the start , the middle and the ending.
The story is simple as it's a death of a man to be investigated. everything seems to be taking us into a normal story where you keep searching for the killer till you reach the killer in the end , however it's a very new plot that I've not seen like before.
even though it looks similar to A murder on the orient express movie however it's much better , every character has a significant role to play , you can't take any character out of the movie even the one who was found dead in the beginning of the movie. The flash back technique is very well used in the movie , you can't feel like it's overused or something , it's very useful and brings more interesting facts during the movie.
The plot is one of the best to watch in such kind of movies.
Even the comedy is very well used and really very funny in the scenes it was used for.I really enjoyed the movie and really encourage every one to watch and enjoy it.",Knives Out

1281,anthonymigliori,A downright fun time of a film!,10,19 January 2020,"Knives Out, written and directed by Rian Johnson, is a prime example of what happens when you combine a stellar ensemble cast, a smartly-penned script, and brilliantly-constructed suspense provided by a good director who has proved his talents with his previous (except one) films.For the performances, Ana De Armas shines like gold. While the actress has already had some leading roles in the past, I think this film cements her status as an outstanding leading lady. The rest, including Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield...Oh, what the hell? Everyone in this phenomenal ensemble of a cast is awesome in their own ways.For writer-director Rian Johnson, while Star Wars: The Last Jedi was kind of a slip-up for the usually acclaimed helmer, he made a comeback with a film that brilliantly combines the tropes of Hitchcock with the traditional whodunnit narrative. While the comedic elements seem to be a little too much at times, possibly a little distracting for audiences, at least it's not overdone to the extent where you feel like you need your money back.Overall, this fun mystery of a film some on the edge of you seat and at times laughing, and is guaranteed not to disappoint those who enjoy a good whodunnit.",Knives Out
1282,yiyanzhao-79074,"Surprise, surprise, surprise",7,22 February 2020,"The story line is perfect for a mystery. There are so many surprises awaits.
I initially thought the atmosphere would be quite gloomy in the same way as the Agatha Christie ones, but the mood is actually quite uplifting apart from some disturbing scenes.
However, the moral of the story seems to be a bit worn-out, which makes the ending much more easier to predict. This sort of diminish the excitement of watching.
The set up of the decoration the the house is incredible, especially with the wall of knives. However, it does give of the feeling of a 20th century setting in the trailer, and I was a bit surprised to see iPhones appearing in the film.",Knives Out

1284,keridb,Surprisingly entertaining,8,21 May 2020,"What I loved most about this movie is its tiny unpredictable twists. Unlike some movies that have one FINAL TWIST at the end...(don't get me wrong...this did have a final big twist) but, the movie also sprung several small ones throughout. If you didn't notice the small twist, turns and references...you might want to watch it again.
Craig's portrayal of a sleuth detective is believable. The main female lead has a quirky, but loveable, disadvantage. And in my opinion, every single family member has some ""idiosyncrasy"" that makes you want to (metaphorically) slap them; at one point or another.
There's some slapstick humor that sometimes makes you want to smack your forehead. But best of all, when the big reveal happens, all the puzzle pieces fall right in to place.This movie was face-paced, witty, sarcastic, obnoxious, hilarious, endearing, infuriating, and yet...almost relatable.
I would watch it again.",Knives Out

1286,pekka-raninen-1,Frustratingly disappointing,5,3 October 2021,"I had high hopes for this film, with the ensemble cast and everything. Turns out it is just disappointing. I gave 5/10 just for the set and the photography. Basically a whodunnit ""mystery"" with a totally predictable plot and outcome.I guess somebody had a (bad) heureka moment of doing a Poirot-like crime mystery. I suggest watching a real Poirot or other decent private investigator film instead of this total waste of two hours. Also, Daniel Craig is in a completely wrong film and role, with a laughable accent. I feel sorry for him.But the craziest idea is, as it seems to be, to make a *sequel* to this nothingness. And it's also ridiculous - but totally fitting for an American movie - to have a fr***ng CAR CHASE in a mystery film that happens in a mansion!",Knives Out
1287,yardem,It's almost depressing how much potential this film held,7,8 August 2021,"The twist revealed in the first quarter of the film was executed beautifully as we start making assumations on who may've done it, we start to waver between Walter or Joni. The cinematography is masterful, the stuff of magnificence. When it is revealed that Marta was behind the murder ""or so we think"". It truly does leave you struck, wondering about the possible outcomes of the remaining 3 quarters of the movie.At this point of the movie, it is on par with films like Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" or one of my favourite movies Bong Joon-Ho's ""Parasite"".From this point it leave's you on the edge of your seat.After this the film doesn't pick up much at all until the part where we realise that Thrombey had left Marta all of the money, sending everyone in the family crazy. From this point it's almost as if it exits the Hitchcockian aspect of things and enters more of a Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" esque.Then an oddly placed car chase takes place which feels just weird.After this the film takes some unnecessary and some what unrealistic turns that make the film feel rushed and unnatural. This just ruins the entire thing for me.There's then a nice sequence of Ransom being arrested, it would've been better if the film had ended here, rather than dragging it on for longer than this. The film ends with Marta on the balcony sipping a cup of coffee saying ""My House, My rules, My coffee. Backed with some. Peculiar music which didn't fit the vibes of the film itself, as I said before it would've been slightly better if they had've ended it with ransom beind arrested.Disapointing film, with so much potental.Still worth a watch.",Knives Out

1291,kozel-4,A modern day Poirot,8,27 December 2019,"Let the mystery begin! When you sit down you kinda know what to expect if you watched the trailer, but at the same time you have no idea what's going to happen next. Whenever a question is answered in the story, another one right away arise.The story gives you the classic ""this is my main suspect"" phenomena to pick your guilty party when you conduct your own ""investigation"" during the dialogues, but obviously you can't be sure if you're right or wrong. Cleverly giving out clues during the story progression makes you realize that you may be wrong all along.
I can't remember a period during the movie when I didn't have to pay attention. Everything the characters say and do on screen, adds up to the greater picture.Great cast and performance from all the actors involved. Excellent entertainment for 2 hours. Well written, great directing along with great music. If you want something different, I highly recommend to check this one out.",Knives Out

It was fun even with the obvious holes in the plot.

Why even ask her cousin to get the toxicology report for her?
On top of this illogical unfolding of events, the toxicology report was clean! That should have stopped her even acting on suspicion.Other weird stuff: when did Ransom have time to torch the lab or kill Fran (who meets the very presumptuously suspected attempted murderer alone and unarmed)? Wasn't he WITH Marta?Apart from that I did feel it was a bit boring at times. What is the viewer supposed to do if the ""murder"" is explained early on and no other suspects are presented with opportunity? Sure, they all have reason but none is shown to could have done it.Nonetheless I spun my yarn of how readily the old man cut his own throat and had a plan ready for Marta's escape. Changed up medicine was the first idea and it smelled like a plan to smoke out the rats in his family. It wasn't though, just ironic heroics to deliver an emotional punch of him committing suicide in vain.I liked the atmosphere and the acting.
My rating is more a 7,51. The cast made me round up.",Knives Out
1294,lwgoodrich,Entertaining Whodunit,8,29 November 2019,"I enjoyed this film from start to finish. It has enough twists and turns to make Agatha Christie proud. A family patriarch worth millions - ironically, from his outrageously successful mystery novels - dies in his huge country mansion following his eighty-fifth birthday party. Although it appears to be suicide, a world-famous detective who arrives on the scene isn't so sure.There are certainly plenty of suspects - his voraciously greedy family members have been sponging off him for years, and live in constant fear of being cut out of his will. Added to the mix is his young, sweet-natured nurse, who is the one person in the household he genuinely likes.What went down that night is revealed before the movie is halfway through - but is it the whole story? The detective (played with a Southern accent of indeterminate origin by Daniel Craig) and the nurse team up to unravel the old gentleman's death. But can either one of them trust the other?A sterling cast is in fine form - Jamie Lee Curtis as the victim's daughter swanning about the huge house, the incomparable Toni Colette as his widowed daughter-in-law and self-help guru, Don Johnson as the blustering son-in-law, Chris Evans playing against type as the smarmy grandson, and numerous others. Cast standouts are Craig and Ana de Armas, who shines in the part of Marta, the pretty nurse.There are humorous moments, but don't expect big laughs. Try to count the number of different South American nationalities ascribed to immigrant nurse Marta by this phony bunch as they keep insisting she's ""one of the family""....I'm not sure if they ever got the right one. There are a few pointed references to the social and political culture we live in as well.A very well-done movie, with the most natural-sounding dialogue I've heard in modern films - nearly all the characters talk like ""real"" people, with a singular lack of artifice. And I appreciated the fact that the gorgeous gothic mansion in its parklike setting is in itself one of the film's most outstanding characters. Its interiors must be seen to be believed.All in all,a highly enjoyable experience; I recommend it.",Knives Out

Even though this movie was intended to be a parody of the sleuth genre, the plot could've been deeper and more thought off. Half of the family didn't have any reason to kill the patriarch, at least not a solid one.
The development of the story was lagging sufficiently and it was not leading to the final build up like in a classic whodunnit movie. Oh, and the dialogue wasn't on the expected level.

Daniel Craig's attempt to imitate Alabama born french is brutal. Eww. Tries too hard. Ana de Armas has only one expression, that of being dumb. How did she bag this movie ? Chris Evans is not convincing in this role either. Now about the story, there is one, but there is no twist in the story. There is nothing that we havent seen before. How did RT gave it 97% ?

1307,BrorsanW,Disappointing but still enjoyable,7,13 November 2019,"After having seen all of Johnson's movies except for The Brothers Bloom I expected something a little bit more from Knives Out. A more mature, cold film with it's tounge in cheek is what I wanted after previously enjoying Brick and Looper so much. I was at least very happy to see it put a curious twist on the murder mystery genre. The story takes a very different path than I expected. Sadly, it seems as though they could have gone in harder with this twist, it goes back to the usual motions after a while.As it is this has to be Johnson's most accessible movie yet. It's a star-studded cast filled with old reliabales and also some newcomers. Though I don't feel as though the actors were given very much time to properly shine it's all very lovely and nice. The high saturation and crazy colorful sets should grab the interest of most viewers aswell, though I do find the cinematography quite formulaic.If you're looking for a nice family film you can take your children or parents to you're sure to have a blast.

But the story was a stinker! If you couldn't figure out who the killer was in the first 15 minutes you were probably unconscious. There's a segment of the movie about halfway through that's at least 40 minutes too long. I wanted to get up and go sit out in the lobby and wait for it to end. It was so boring and tedious to watch.

The cast is outstanding and I love that each and every one of them has a very distinct and unique character! Yet, overall it was just lacking. Spoilers ahead: truthfully I don't think that Chris Evans Character killed his grandfather. Yes he tried to, but in the end, it wasn't him. But that's just a theory.., a film theory. Anyways, this movies a fun time but I wouldn't recommend going out and spending money to see it. Just wait for it to come out on dvd.

At first I assumed it would stick to the general conventions of the whodunnit, as the movie started with Agatha Christie style suspect interviews. But from there it diverted slowly into its own modern twists. As the stakes got higher and events kept getting stranger, I became both excited and apprehensive for the story's direction. Could the ending really tie up all these loose threads? How will Marta or Blanc resolve any of this?Several times I thought I had the answer. And then I realized I hadn't. This movie was really good at that: keeping me in the guessing game until the very end. It had this push and pull with the pacing so that I always felt like I was just one step away from solving the mystery myself, only to get to the final reveal and get blown away. It was just so satisfying.And the performances were great too. As humorous as Knives Out was, there were also some politically charged scenes. These things can get a bit awkward depending on the performance, but I felt it was handled with great wit and care. It helped that all the characters were written very well. While the Thrombey family were all entitled rich pricks, they each had their own special shade of entitlement that I found very amusing.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. All the beats and characters worked for me. Especially the star sleuth, Blanc. I would love to see more of his patient, observant style of detective work in the sequel.",Knives Out

Daniel Craig's southern fried detective has been hired to find out by a mysterious client and he believes there might have been foul play.In Knives Out, everyone has a motive. The cast is filled with some of the brightest and most dependable actors Hollywood has to offer and the pacing never sags for a second. You'll be second guessing everything up until the final reveal. I'm impressed by how little the trailers actually spoiled this time.To say too much about the film would be a huge disservice to those wanting to see it, but I can say that twists and turns abound, no one is who you really think they are, the acting is fantastic, the laughs plentiful, and you'll have an excellent time.",Knives Out

Knives Out seriously succeeds at what it's meant to be, a thoroughly original whodunnit, that is genuinely fun to watch and try and figure out, and when you think you've done that you might just be surprised. It's full of little notes and quirks that make it really fun to try and figure out, with an excellent cast of likewise quirky characters and it ends interestingly and comfortably. It's humorous and entertaining and I enjoyed it. It's directed in all the right ways to give it away, but not at first glance, making it a great mystery. I think Agatha Christie would enjoy it. It's cool to think there are still some fun twists and turns out there and to think that people can keep coming up with fun stories and entertainment makes me pleased for the future of cinema. Sure it does get a little bogged down with its political humour, which makes it awkward at times and honestly it could have done without. Nonetheless, Knives Out can take you out of reality for a few hours and on an adventure to places you mightn't have expected. 9/10 from me for a movie I enjoyed.",Knives Out

1329,xaliber13,"Not the best written movie this year, but surely one among the most entertaining.",9,28 December 2019,"Saying the film is predictable is not wrong, but it is missing the point. Just toward the first halves the film dropped plenty of clues toward pointing the suspect of the crime, but the point was not about ""who did it"", but ""how and why it was done."" Indeed, perhaps in the first half audience is intentionally misled to get the impression of typical murder mystery through Knives Out stylistic ""who did it"" fashion, but as the film goes it shows that there is more to it.If one pays attention to the details. audience have been invited to ask ourselves about the mystery of the process of the murder - on the continuously shaking legs and the barking dogs - and even the especially charming Daniel Craig asked us, almost invitingly, who really hired him and why? The twist and turn is not about the result; but the process.And doing that, Rian Johnson is still able to slip a neat ""moral of the story"", with a rather bittersweet moment when the truth is finally revealed. ""You're a good person who follows your heart"" might be one of the most repeatedly cliche, but taking a backdrop of distrust and money in a family drama, Johnson's words spoken through Craig's character with his characteristic accent made the delivery much more impactful. The slick cinematography and excellent music directing in the whole movie supports this perfectly paced murder mystery.There is a notable questionable holes that may push you from your suspension of disbelief, but still: a delightful Christmas story to end the year; Knives Out is one film I'd recommend to get you absorbed to its intricate details.",Knives Out

With numerous twists and turns, this film kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its entire runtime. Right when you think you know who is responsible - boom! Benoit Blanc discovers another piece of evidence that derails the investigation even more.
The actors are phenomenal, as expected. Daniel Craig's performance as detective Benoit Blanc is absolutely incredible. The characters are as charming as insufferable. Ransom is a particularly good example in this sense, as he walks the line between good and bad multiple times in the movie, leaving us as well as Marta utterly confused.

No-one came off as cartoonish or caricatures of people. A film like this, truly, stands on it's writing. Bull's-eye!

I believe it to be what every mystery movie is aiming to be: entertaining, clever and remarkable.I give it 8 stars because I had one problem while watching it though. Benoit Blanc is not very remarkable. He is supposed to be the great detective of the story and yet he is shoved in the background once we meet my girl Marta Cabrera. And I am not complaining about the fact we see more of her - I absolutly LOVE Marta Cabrera and her conflicts and how they help advance the story, but I believe that, in order for me to care about Blanc as a person, he deserved more personality than his casual snark remarks and the fact that he became a meme.

1343,MouazHajBakri,"Genius script, dazzling performances, stellar direction, playing into a true American masterpiece",9,1 December 2019,"Knives out is written and directed by Ryan Johnson, a brilliant ingenious who had directed the clever Sci-Fi ""Looper"" and two of the most important pieces of TV ever made, ""Ozymandias"" and ""Fly"" of Breaking Bad. In his latest project he clearly poured his heart and soul into a brilliant script that drew a dream ensemble of cast elevating this picture into a level of an absolute masterpiece.Its build as an Agatha Christi ""who done it"" theme around the demise of an old wealthy American novelist in his house on the night of his 85th birthday party that all his family had attended. His family members are kind of parasites that collectively make a highly dysfunctional family. The suicide/murder mystery plays beautifully into a familiar story arc, but is quickly challenged by a new take rarely seen in this genre by throwing pieces of the truth (or is it?) into the plot with surprisingly very easy to follow style of editing, and this elevates the tension and engagement of the viewer to a new enriching level.Much can be said about the clever screenplay, wicked humor, beautiful production design, and the stellar performances, but what really drew me was the story within the story, and the metaphors delivered through this stylistic mystery thriller flick. Slowly you would see that each member of this family resemble something about the modern twisted capitalism of America that makes this ugly gray zone between what this country was and what it truly is. The true American is old and genuine who dies quickly in the very first minute of the picture. He is a writer, an artist, and a true gentleman who held grudges on his family after exposing their true vampire nature and thusly had an affection to the only true human in his house, his nurse, an immigrant from a country (laughably always missed by each family member). The family mostly, yet in a heavily condescending manner, show appreciation and admiration towards the nurse and consider her to be part of the family, much like the attitude of the serial killer white extremist family of Jordan Peel's ""Get Out"". The nurse herself is simple and kind who, as lots of foreigners in this country, are often alienated and reduced by aggression on one hand, and arrogant altruism on the other. Of course, the family is very quick in showing their true colors towards her when the circumstances are shifted, and also very quick in a shameless ""apology"" to her when things shift back, something that feels very familiar nowadays.Each son, daughter, grandkid, son/daughter in law has a unique element of the twisted and manipulated ""American dream"" symphony. The movie sarcastically reduces them into cheating bourgeoises, hypocrite preachers, pathetic beggars, evil thieves, and last but not least, into a mind washed anti-immigrant Nazi teenager. They pretend to be self-made individuals, but in an obvious sarcastic way, they are mere opportunists salvaging from the roots of a true passionate artist whose talent resembles the true American idea. The script doesn't shy away from these definitions, playing a clever game of dark-comedy by shinning the contrast between what America has been, what America is now, and what America should very much come again to be.What makes Knives out a masterpiece is that it has them all, the idea, the script, the performance, the production design, the editing. It is a very funny movie that shifts from the light humor to the pitch dark, a clever and maximally entertaining spectrum. It engulfs its qualities into an engaging old-fashioned thriller mystery, and finally weaves a socio-political commentary that works as a unique American story affected by the latest radical changes in its recent decades. It's an optimistic picture that sends a true necessary message of respect to the old, of criticism to the ""modern"", and to what true America should strive again to be. Without a doubt one the best movies of this century.",Knives Out

1348,lluewhyn,"Good, not great",7,2 December 2019,"For all those who didn't like The Last Jedi (and still might be interested in seeing this), there is some good news and bad news. The bad news is that some of the elements people didn't like in TLJ are still present, the good news is that the worst of them are either toned down or are much better served in an original mystery than in an action adventure with an existing IP, such as the need to ""subvert expectations"" or to show off how Johnson's cleverness (the script is cutely clever cute, but not as brilliant as it thinks it is). The final twists seem a little over-written and not without plot-holes, but honestly that's fairly standard for the mystery genre.This might be better appreciated by those who can't get enough of these kinds of murder mysteries, although the film changes genres several times, and stops being a murder mystery for a long portion of the run-time. A key reveal is made so early on (end of the 1st Act?), that the mystery to me at that point was more ""Where is this movie going now?"" than any curiosity about what else was going to be revealed regarding the murder.Acting is pretty solid across the board , although the all-star cast is somewhat underutilized and disappears for long stretches of time. This very structure unfortunately strongly hints towards later developments, even if you can't predict the fine details.I didn't find the movie to be a laugh riot, with just a few jokes here and there that land (the rest of the theater was silent for most of the film as well), but there are fortunately no cringeworthy jokes a la TLJ's prank-calling or milking scenes.This might sound negative, but the film is entertaining. The payoff at the end is good, but your mileage may vary about whether it was worth the two hours of set-up.",Knives Out
1349,AddisonMc,"Fun on the Surface, Fantastic Underneath.",9,2 October 2020,"I really enjoyed this film. It is full of style and interesting character building. The plot is fantastically written in and presented in an interesting way that separates it from the average whodunnit. In many ways it is classic whodunnit and also very forward-thinking.Under the surface the film is much more than fun, it is packed full of two-pronged dialog that pushes the story forward and deeply characterizes the individuals who make the plot that much better. The story simultaneously reveals who the characters are and presents a metaphor of them.In conclusion I recommend this film to people who just want to sit back and enjoy and movie buffs who are looking for some great story telling. It doesn't take itself too seriously at the same time as it displays the filmmakers deep love and respect for the art form and the genre. A fantastic combination, much like Inception, Kingsman, and many other films that combine fun, style and storytelling technique.",Knives Out

Motives introduced rapidly, then revelations that undo all that set up. If this was a mad cap comedy that would be fine, but this was intended to draw you into the whodunit with the occasional laugh.Still not sure about the opening scene. Nurse comes in, fixes a breakfast and coffee very casually, then goes to bosses bedroom, hmmmm, not there, then casually goes upstairs to his study and finds him dead! Shock, she drops the tray, etc. Turns out she knew he was dead upstairs the entire time because she watched him die!Acting was pretty good, could have done without the political drama, I don't go to movies to watch pantomimes of CNN or Fox talking heads spout their views.The rest of it fit together causing you to have a few ""oh, yeah, that makes sense"" moments.

However what the writers did, was expand on a basic theme, of what happens when people die. From my own experience and association with others, the family gets split by an irrational greed and an attitude of self entitlement.

1361,tjstarr-99199,Underwhelming & predictable. Gives away its key mystery within an hour! Not that clever!,5,12 December 2019,"Once again I left a Rian Johnson film asking myself, did I enjoy that or not? My first instinct was 'no', and remains the same ever since. The film has all the elements of a classic whodunnit story, but the film turns out underwhelming. The biggest problem is within an hour, we are told what happened. The main mystery is solved, and the film transforms from a ""Whodunnit"" into a ""How They Got Away With It"". However, being a Rian Johnson flick there is no way he would not try to ""subvert expectations"". Once you realize this, the outcome is very predictable. This happening halfway really hurts ""Knives Out"" because it takes you almost completely out of the film, which is something Rian is also guilty of doing in his previous film. Figuring out the ""murderer"" by simply paying attention to something as simple as screen presence and on-screen time, downgrades the mystery element of the film. Other successful comic-style whodunnits which featured a large cast of big name performers, had all the suspects together with the investigator for the majority of the film. This is not the case with ""Knives Out"". I could easily dismiss over half the suspects in ""Knives Out"" based on how little involvement their characters were given. Too few lines, rarely mentioned, scarcely involved or seen, little to zero motive = easy to dismiss. In ""Clue"", every character had a good motive and could easily have been the murderer(s). ""Knives Out"", you have maybe 3 good suspects and everyone else can be dismissed. In any whodunnit, a key factor is the setting and location of the crime. The house in ""Knives Out"" is a character on it's own, which is never used to its full potential. In fact, when the film leaves the house over halfway through, I found myself longing for the film to return to the house. In ""Clue"", the house is dark, creepy, and adds a lot to scenes of tension and comedy. The house in ""Knives Out"" is well designed for a whodunnit, but outside of the cool circle of knives, the house is never used to its full potential in this comedy murder mystery. Unlike the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""Knives Out"" is more of Rian Johnson's territory. There is some cleverness, decent comedy, with a fresh and original story, along with solid performances. Even though the whole vomiting from lying bit was dumb from the start. By the end of ""Knives Out"" it's all underwhelming. I'll stick with ""Clue"". Also, I LOVE Daniel Craig, but Johnson has him do a charming southern gentlemen style accent. Or as it's commonly referred to more many times in the flick as a KFC Colonel Sanders accent. Really Rian? Daniel is British. Have Daniel be British! British have charming accents too. Daniel Craig reminded me the whole time of Tom Hanks in ""The Ladykillers"". Trust me I was not the only audience member asking this at the end of the film why on earth would you give Daniel Craig this accent.",Knives Out

1367,sofiaulrikson,"Good Premise, Mediocre Execution",9,8 March 2020,"""Knives Out"" has a simple premise, with loveable characters, hilarious dialogue and a thrilling storyline. The camera work is fabulous, and the design team did a fantastic job bringing the eccentric setting to life.However, there are certain aspects of this movie that could have made it even better:
1. My biggest issue with it was the use of the characters. The cast is among the most vivid and famous of recent films, and the roles they played were quite entertaining and promising. However, only a few of the characters gained a satisfying amount of screen-time.
2. The story would have worked better had the cast been used more. Only the detectives, Martha, Ramson and a couple more characters became truly relevant to the story; and it was ultimately the most explored suspect that was announced the killer.I do, however, think it's a brilliant movie. Everyone can find something to enjoy; the characters, the vivid setting or even the plot twists along the way. It's not the best film of the year, probably, but it's a good binge-watch for crime fiction lovers like myself.",Knives Out

The film progresses quite quickly and when you think the show's over, you're taken on another thrilling ride.The infusion of comedy makes this more a joy to watch alongside the racketeering of rich large families which was equally brought to the foray.While the key piece of the plot hinged on the main character's medical condition, which seemed quite fictitious, it added a new perspective to the movie.",Knives Out

1372,JasonZ,Plot-centered,4,30 November 2019,"This movie is plot-centered. Character development is limited to what is necessary for establishing motivations and relationship dynamics among the characters. This is similar to a movie like Murder on the Orient Express, while I am not comparing the quality of the two movies.The little details explicitly shown or mentioned in the movie are paid off by the end. There are a few times when there's a bit of a question about someone acting out of character, but they're points that can be explained away.The big negative is the politics. One character development point involves the legal status of one character's family, so discussing that particular point is fair game. The grating yelling match about politics in the middle of the movie is not. It had nothing to do with the plot or motivations and took viewers out of the movie. But just hold on -- once it's over, the movie resumes.It's an entertaining movie with Daniel Craig again showing he can do a believable southern accent, if you can overlook the pointless political shouting.",Knives Out
1373,skorgro,Thrilling and captivating.,8,7 March 2020,This movie captures the feeling of a clue game more than the clue movie. The story has twists that are possible to be seen and anticipated but that does not draw away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The length of the movie is arguably perfect and it's climax is nothing short of a good detective story finale. Around the middle of the film I thought: where are they going with this?

From the sounds of the audience in the cinema with myself, the ending was not so easily guessed as most were shocked as the truth was revealed leading me to believe it is still a good ""whodunnit"" movie that will keep most people guessing until the end.

The film was longer than it needed to be, and the camera spent way too much time zoomed in on the pretty nervous girl, whose basic role was to conjure up as many facial expressions (some variation on anguish and confusion) as possible.It was obvious the old man committed suicide, so the whole ""whodunnit"" aspect of a supposed murder mystery was thrown out of the window after 20 minutes! And we all know Trump s*cks, but movies are supposed to be about escape, I don't want culture wars in my movies as well, thanks.This did not live up to the acclaim. And I just wanted it to end. And when it did I was underwhelmed.",Knives Out

Tinted with the shade from last Jedi. I hated that movie so much that I was prepared to hate this one as well (imagine having that chip on your shoulder).Even after the movie, I kept looking for flaws to justify my shoulder chip. However, fair is fair, and at the end of the day, this is a good film. I didn't see much which can be perceived to be of political nature in this one at all. Its a who dun it with a lot of funny one liners set in a fancy estate. The cast was excellent, the writing was classy and funny and listen, you'll have fun while watching it.A movie that doesn't piss you off, with some suspense, good one liners, good cast, A fun time to spend at the cinema. What more do you expect from a movie?I put 9 and 10 star reviews for movies with exemplary technical achievements, pulling off a very difficult sequel or unique artistic value.

This is a masterfully written screenplay and a well directed movie. This movie honours it's genre roots, whilst adding a few extra layers of narrative twist with a modern flavour.It was a shame that once again the director couldn't resist his urges to pepper the work with unnecessary anti-right wing agenda, which weakens the work considerably.

Knives Out definitely lived up to the hype especially with the awesome cast that was in the movie. With a handful of big names in this movie any one would think this movie has to be good and in my opinion it was definitely awesome. I love Chris Evan as an actor and he kind of plays a part where you don't think he is involved as much but ultimately he plays a amazing character in the mystery.

1385,Landon1620251,"More of this, please.",8,13 May 2020,"Really impressed with how well everyone is written in this movie. Everyone is distinct and don't get lost in standing out as the plot rolls on. Ana de Armas in particular shines the brightest in this film. A lot of the focus is on her and it is not waisted.This framing in just about every shot is wonderful. Especially with the character introduction scene, where cinematographer Steve Yedlin is able to use a great combination of close and wide shots to introduce Daniel Craig's character. As a side note; I really appreciated the climax of the film having that Hitchcockian dolly zoom. Nothing else, I was just geeking out that a modern movie used it in a smart way.I would say the unfortunate situation this film has against itself is that I fear it will have very little replay value. With some murder mysteries and ""who-dun-its"" you are encouraged to go back and pick up on details that you may not have noticed before you knew about the big reveal. Thinking back to the events of the film; I don't get that feeling. The reveal truly makes sense with information that is included in the very same scene. A good rewrite of Knives Out would include subtlety inserting details throughout that would encourage the audience to rethink how Christopher Plummer's character died.I do hope that the production team does not go unnoticed this award season. I'm not kidding when I say that the set design, costuming, etc. Is some of the best I have seen in quite some time. A special shoutout goes to the interior layout and set decoration of the Thrombey mansion .While I appreciate Rian Johnson subverting my expectations in a way that hopefully won't set the internet on fire, I did wish that the script allowed me to think for myself. Instead of just being amazed by the great set design, the awesome character writing, and a wonderful mix of score and licensed music.",Knives Out

There are enough obvious hints to point us in the direction of the culprit.That said, the movie has a great set, is filmed in an engaging way, and I think Craig fills his role well.

Great, if you really believe that BS, how is it a lie, you may ask, she can't lie for she will puke, just as she deliberately showed to Detective Blanc and the policemen during her first interview. Brilliant, I must say, she played everyone like fiddles. So, what really happened?She perhaps, not merely ""friend"" of Harlan, dare I say, she is a lover of Harlan, what they did in that room including ""what you know"" between two lovers would usually do. Therefore, the only logical explanation why Harlan changes his final will when he is fully sober is that he loves Marta and think Marta loves him as well. For Marta she probably knows the will from Harland, at least she outsmarts him so she can tell from the daily conversation and Go playing.At that night Harlan was dead, Marta can tell she inject the right medicine, once again, in the final of the movie she can tell the slight differences between them, so she can definitely tell the nuances at that night. She knew someone switched them to play dirty, she decided let them play, she maybe causes the Harlan's suicide or she cut his throat by her own hands, we can't know because Harlan is dead. She sneaked back to home and waited Ransom to play, by the time she might not know for sure it was him, anyone in this family was possible.What happened next was almost exactly she expected. We have to notice that since beginning of the movie, she dismissed her mother's complain about her sister listening the murder show, if she was worried as heck about her misdoing caused Harlan's death, she should at least show some emotions and worrisome, however she showed nothing but calm, she is a cold blood murder or player.In the end, the dumbass Blanc and the others were convinced she was decent, smart, innocent and ""lie to puke"" nurse who deserves everything, and Ransom attempts to murder Harland and murders Fran, so he should go to jail, and rest of family are bad, which I don't deny, so should move away and live in poverty. Just like most of us have been outsmarted by her. The moment she stood on the balcony and hold the cup on which written ""my house my rule"", she declared her decisive victory and mocked the rest.TLDR; Marta planed it since beginning, don't be fooled by her trick and lying POV.

The list of ""A-list"" and ""up and coming"" actor's, and actresses are truly something special, but the way they interact with each other just makes this movie feel even more special. Usually when a group of actors with this much talent comes together they struggle for the spot light. I just feel like everyone had an good sense of who their character is.The story was also very unpredictable, and it kept me guessing from beginning to end. It started out with me pointing finger's, then I thought I knew who the killer was. Finally the end came, and lets just say I was over thinking the whole time. The writing for Benoit Blanc is genius and the way Daniel portrayed this character is genius. All of his little mannerisms, and subtle gestures are just perfect for this character.The set design deserves some praise. The chair with all the knives is incredible, but so is the rest of the house! It feels like an Agatha Christie novel from start to finish, and at the same time I don't think it's trying to hard.
The BAD: The costume design feels lazy. I feel like none of the characters are showing how wealthy they are. The only person who looks kinda outlandish and matches her character is Jame Lee Curtis. Also who in their right mind would buy an old BMW, then use that as their everyday car?Do the detectives not carry handcuffs or a gun? No spoilers, but even when they get introduced, you don't see a badge, or any credentials. The writing for the detectives are almost none existent. They serve no purpose to the story, which is a shame because they're played by two very good actors.

Everyone has a reason to kill him and the events from the night of the murder unfold slowly. We find out quite early on from one point of view what happened that night, but is it the true story?It did remind me of an Agatha Christie type story, having the family in a room and each being accused of murder, finding out tidbits of the story, but mainly we follow the story of Marta, the nurse and Benoit Blanc, which is quite comical at times.This did not feel like 2 hours to me, it flew by, it was over before I knew it. I was laughing at the bitchiness of the family, what a load of Queens, Each person had a role and they all played it well, it truly was some awesome acting!I would love to see a series on Blanc!

1416,Hyacinthia,Refreshingly fun well thought out movie,9,2 January 2020,"This movie is refreshingly fun. I'm sick of boring depressing movies and shows that makes us think life just sucks. There are some lighthearted but dumb stuff out there. This movie is fun AND smart. It doesn't take itself too seriously and the mystery unfolds nicely at the perfect pace so it's never boring or patronizing.
Would I watch it again or ponder the meaning for weeks? Probably not. But I walked out feeling like I did something fun and enjoyable, which is what movies should be.",Knives Out

Starting with the death of a wealthy novelist, most of the characters come out and focus on a young nurse. In addition to the bizarre and ingenuity, the film also shows the audience two faces before and after the will. Marta's kindness and Lanson's heart are cruel, human nature promotes the plot, and it also brings a reversed ending. The music in the film is very memorable and impressive.",Knives Out

The star filled cast didn't have one person letting down and every character was thrilling.From start to finish I enjoyed every minute the direction of the movie flowed perfectly and i couldn't pick a fault and I hugely recommend you watch this movie. 10/10",Knives Out
1426,cjdm-22407,Stars Out,8,5 December 2019,8 Stars. When I watched the trailer I didn't think there was a way this movie could break the 8 star barrier but after I watched I was wrong. The movie is highly engaging not predictable and all around a blast. I was never bored.,Knives Out
1427,CharlesAncelle,The Knives aren't really out,6,28 November 2019,"Knives Out has found a way to turn many of the genre's tropes on their heads and that very much deserves to be praised. Ana De Armas is touching, vulnerable, truthful, endearing, and outshines pretty much the entirety of the remaining star-studded cast, which is also very impressive.
Overall, after a very clunky beginning, we get into the story and it moves pretty smoothly throughout, and the movie keeps its momentum going until at the very least, the end of the second act.But when we get to the third act, it starts to feel like the need for never ending twists takes over at the cost of logic and realism, which obviously is often the case in these kinds of movies. But, I would argue a truly successful murder mystery should end with the realization that we have been staring at the truth all along and yet couldn't quite see it - and in that respect, I feel like the movie fails.
It also fails in portraying characters that feel real for the most part - with the exception of Ana De Armas, everyone feels a little bit like a caricature, best exemplified by the sixteen year old teenage boy who spends his entire time on his phone to promote the alt-right. Many of such cliches are played for humor, but for the most part, the few comedic moments of the film fall flat - in particular, Daniel Craig's sadly clumsily delivered Detective character, meant to be an American Hercule Poirot, but whose quirks are simply forgettable and frankly, unimaginative.Finally, the story simply does not fully deliver on its themes, its conclusion feels rushed and shallow: good people end up happy, and bad people are punished, no redemption or nuance whatsoever, the story is black and white, and that may have worked during Agatha Christie's time, but I don't think modern audiences will accept it as easily.",Knives Out

But, if you're looking for an entertaining, clever film that will have you thinking and on your toes, then go see this movie.First of all, the cast is great! So many faves and all fit their respective roles very well.The movie starts out quickly and gets right to the point. After that you will be strung along on a ride that makes you wonder who the culprit is, and when you may have thought you figured it out, it proves you wrong.You are taken on a fast ride of twists and turns with a ton of chuckles tossed in the mix. In the end, it is all explained and neatly wrapped up for you.I enjoy films that are entertaining, make me think and try to guess whodunnit, and then gives an explanation that makes sense. If you want to be entertained for 2 hours then please set this film. I think it's highly underrated and was definitely under advertised.9 stars for me with a star taken away due to a poor choice of accent given to one of the characters/actors. For me , it was annoying and took away a little bit from the film.",Knives Out
1431,candidopeito,Agatha Christie's inspiration,9,11 January 2020,"Honestly the movie wasn't that hard to predict but still, it's a great movie, it's super fun, it has comedy, it has tense moments, great performances especially from Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas that I think that deserves a nomination to Best supporting actress, in short there is a mix of factors that make this movie one of the best of 2019, I don't know if it will get a Best Picture nomination, but in my opinion it deserves it.",Knives Out
1432,synazirmas,Just overrated,3,13 December 2020,"First thing that captured my attention was Daniel Craig. Very wrongly casted. He did put a lot of effort on the accent, did his best to portray a Poirot type of character, but no. He was not right for the role.
The story was kind of a Agatha Christie mystery, minus the gripping suspense. The editing gave me a headache. The setting was a headache. The story flow was so disjointed. Great actors talents put to waste.",Knives Out

1435,turtlemom1,An entertaining whodunnit,9,7 December 2019,"We went with friends to see this clever film and all enjoyed it. It's a great holiday film, with a terrific cast. The acting was a little over the top, nevertheless appropriate to the film. They seemed to have fun with their parts. It's a tongue in cheek take on a Christie type detecting story, with enough false clues to everyone wondering. We loved the set decorations... not something one always notices, but the props, the building, the spookiness added to the fun. And then there was Daniel Craig's affected accent... a character all of it's own.I wish there were more films like being made like this... it entertained all of us, with differing tastes.",Knives Out
1436,mwories,Craig's accent distracts. Could have been great.,6,21 June 2020,"The movie is a US remake of the classic British whodunnit, with a comical twist. However Craig's acting was cringingly awkward and distracting, with a poor attempt at a southern accent. That's not his fault, but the director's to not recognize this failure. Somehow they tried to emulate Poirot with a Southern accent. If done well, it could have been funny.At some point in the movie we got used to it and overall it was entertaining. But it could have been a great movie with some better choices.",Knives Out
1437,Brimm62,Full of logical holes,2,14 February 2020,"Great acting throughout the whole movie. The problem is that the focus was on political correctness (white people always bad, immigrants always good) instead of filling logical gaps in the story. Missed opportunity.",Knives Out

The film has a fantastic cast but not even they could make this totally improbably story line work. Daniel Craig is easy to enjoy and he always seems relaxed on screen but he did have difficulty with his accent. I'm not American so this could be unfair but Dick van Dyke's cockney does spring to mind.
Please understand, the acting was mostly excellent. It was just that the story was not sensible. Finally, it's only fair to say that one person shone above all the rest and that was Ana de Armas",Knives Out

It's like a reinvented old classic who-done-it but in a modern time frame, think back to a classic Alfred Hitchcock flick or a movie adapted Agatha Christie novel. The only thing that might've (and I say might've because this movie was just so good otherwise) been cool is if it were set back to an older time rather than a modern one but still, very very cool movie and very well done!

1456,hendersonandrew-61451,Enjoyable other than Daniel Craig,6,8 September 2021,"This movie is a bit of a let down. Overall a reasonable story that unfolds, and it keeps you interested. The ensemble cast is really cool, Ana De Armas does a great job, as does Chris Evans and Chris Plummer. Almost everyone is fun to watch... other than Daniel Craig. He was obviously trying a new twist for his character and it flops big-time. His accent is terrible, not believable at all! This is the first movie I've watched with him in it where I hated him. His South African accent in Munich was on point, so he can do a foreign accent. But this one just sucks and to be honest, his accent alone spoiled this whole movie for me. If you can get past the way he talks, you'll probably really enjoy this film. It isn't taxing, just a fun story that's nothing too original or crazy. Cheers.",Knives Out

1459,Manuelgroesch1-1,America's downfall wrapped in a Whodunit mystery,10,29 November 2019,"This would be a nice whodunit, Agatha Christie-like mystery film with Daniel Craig as a modern-day and Southern interpretation of Hercule Poirot with a few good jokes and good twists and turns.
But that would have gotten it a 7 or 8 rating from me.
What makes this movie one of the best of the year is the underlying message.The movie begins with self-agrandizing introductions of the family members. The rich family who like to think that they have ""built everything from the ground up"" are really a bunch of failed or delusional characters that live off the fame and fortune of the family partriarch.
Jaime Lee Curtis is the closest thing to self-made you get in the Thrombrey family, but later we learn she got a million dollar loan from her father (sound familiar?) to get her started. Then there are Joni and her lifestyle brand and Meg with her liberal arts studies, the first broke and the second studying something useless in real life. Both living off Harlan. Alex at least is honest about his life and entitlement and his dependency on his grandfather. However, it is ultimately revealed that he would do anything to not have to earn his own Lifelihood.The contrast to Marta, the Hispanic nurse could not be bigger, she is a kind, loyal, hard-working and compassionate person and the only real friend Harlan has at his birthday party.It is through her honesty (she even has to throw up when she lies) that Marta ultimately prevails over the dishonest family. In the course of the mystery she almost always acts morally sound and shows genuine emotion faced with all the crazy turns of the story.
The family pretend to have let her into their lives and several times call her ""family"" but none of the know which Latin American country she is actually from calling her everything from Brazilian to Uruguayan and revealing how empty their words are. Their actions after the will is revealed show even more starkly that they never saw her as part of the family. Even Meg and especially Joni, who seem to be less racist (at least in a discussion about the Trump administration) turn their backs on her as soon as their own inheritance is involved and their earlier professions of empathy with Marta are revealed to be superficial. Meg even uses the information she has on Martas mother to pressure her.Ultimately, when Captain America is arrested for the murders Marta was supposed to be accused of, when all the self-aggrandizing colapses into itself and the pure-hearted and now rich Marta looks down from the balcony on the brats that wanted to ""protect their ancestral right"" to the house and fortune, you really see the similarities to an ever.more isolationist America that looks to the past for greatness and violates its own values to protect the wealth the current generations didn't even accumulate. It is the best depiction of the current state of affaires I have seen that is also funny and entertaining. And that gets my 10 stars!",Knives Out
1460,zysis,A magnum opus,10,11 February 2020,"Rarely does such a great story be told. This film is a masterwork of layering, intrigue. Cleverly disguising itself as a run of the mill murder mystery. This one would make even Kubrick or Hitchcock raise their eyebrows in story and film making. To see it is one thing, but to truly watch it is something else. There's just too much to mention but any fan of the narratives in murder mystery and the craft of film making can truly admire this film with a tremendous amount of respect. Everything is carefully gathered into a beautiful telling of what is truly a masterwork in all facets of storytelling. I tip my hat to all involved and would highly recommend it's viewing to both young and old.Suffice to say, this is one of few films I could give ten stars. The acting, the cast, the sets, all of it.

1481,LiamFriedman,Would prefer a knife in me,6,1 January 2020,"GENERAL REVIEW
Going in, I was expecting an energetic Edgar Wright feel, and complex Sherlock Holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time. What I got was a cookie cutter 'mystery' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours, rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.SPOILER TIMEIn regards to acting, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans gave great performances. 0 complaints for the main 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Harlan and Marta's scenes. There are more than 3 members of the cast, of which I have complaints; Jamie Lee Curtis and Micheal Shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines, probably due to Rian Johnson's directing. Don Johnson was good, LaKeith Stanfield was not, others were mediocre or just less.
Special Daniel Craig section. Daniel Daniel Daniel. What was that. The screenplay reads ""Blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life."" That is not what I was forced to listen to. The accent was very distracting and I could only hope for a case of Stockholm syndrome that never came. His character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective, but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. If that didn't bother you then it would have been a good performanceAs mentioned I was expecting more Edgar Wright-esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.Overall, the writing is very basic, being a typical murder mystery. I am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. Throughout the story, there were many setups with minimal or no payoff, e.g. shoe blood, where is Marta from (Harlan should have commented to Ransom during their fight where she is from). There were also too many inconsistencies, like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time, some people went up with a noise and down without because Rian Johnson forgot.
For the final reveal; Marta must be especially talented to feel ""tincture and viscosity"" of vials, a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe, but she had made the choice already which solution to use, maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. Also, the shots for Fran's last words were different, where she said ""you did this"" in the scene and first flashback, but ""Hugh did this"" in the last. These 2 issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries, in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention, instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts.
The suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. By looking at the cast you can see it's either Jamie Lee Curtis, Micheal Shannon or Chris Evans, personally I guessed Micheal Shannon due to his typecasting, but when I realised that all 3 of Harlan's children where the same character, with different jobs, it was then obviously the built up character named Ransom. Ransom. His name is Ransom.This leads me to one of my main critiques: Unnecessary characters. Despite all 3 of Harlan's children being the same, the ""nazi kid"" served 1 purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character, the granddaughter, Katherine Langford served a whopping 2 purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. There were 2 cops and Blanc for some reason, of which the comedic policeman was not funny.Lastly, too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise 'every time', Marta vomiting when she lies, the dogs choosing to like and dislike people, or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware (secret doors and prop knives)",Knives Out

I saw the ending coming about halfway through, and this isn't by any means ""original"" as Rian tries to sell it to be.This was a slow SLOW moving movie with little to no tension and a predictable ending.Rian Johnson's talent for mystery and suspense is on par with Daniel Craig's southern accent in this movie-not good.I can say that I'm glad I saw it in a theater to support movie going, but Rian has really overhyped this movie and wants you to believe it's a masterpiece he's created when it's really a slow-moving mediocre film at best without much substance at all.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS did mystery and suspense much better than this one.

Just goes to show that this original screenplay is more than worth it, this movie (shot on film) is a true masterpiece and nobody should hesitate to watch it.

1504,handmethatspanner,Too many influences? Hard to watch.,5,26 January 2021,"Satirical. Wannabe cautionary tale. Almost a comedy. Dressed-up as a who-dun-it with a laudable and worthy cast, doubtless each of whom saw some facet of potential in the script. There are bright moments where a flame is almost sustained.In reaching for everything -- it grasps nothing.
A terrific opportunity for most cast members to stretch and grow, to demonstrate new range and reach for the kind of roles previously filled by major talents recently lost to the ravages of time.Ultimately it is grating to watch as the off camera talent was missing or massively divided in their conceptions which forced an ineffective compromise.Rather like watching a 2019 'slice of life' of distant relatives of 'the Baudelaire orphans' as told by stoners -- lacking the individual magic of the stunning cast of that cult classic that so charmed and amazed in 2004.So much potential lost between the fingers of incompetents. Reminds me of the parable told of the dog with the bone crossing a bridge who sees his reflection... and drops the bone.Someone needs to be sure that the Producer faction, the Director faction, and the Editor faction never work together again.
It just fails to gel -- can not even sustain an emulsion.

1505,Max_Simpson,Inexplicable hype for a mediocre film,4,5 December 2019,"Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused.",Knives Out

Michael Shannon is one of my favorite actors of all time and to see him pull off yet another convincing role blew my mind. Anyways I leave it with 7 stars. I thought it was creative and witty but I felt the movie didn't quite have a defined identity for what it wanted to be. I think it might have been a little falsely advertised in the trailers, mistaken to be more of a dramedy, but when you watch it, the humor is either restrained or frankly not funny-I can't tell.

The production value is high, wonderfully done settings and atmosphere, however there was a lack of use for the exterior of the grounds to really set the mood.
This wasn't a comedy, or drama, or mystery, it was just a blandly told story. If you are in the mood for a romp of a good time reflective of the older styled who done it films, pass on this one.

Daniel Craig is on top form here as detective Benoit Blanc and the plot keeps the audience guessing with its constant twists and turns.Putting a modern spin on the classic 'whodunnit' Agatha Christie type plot is nothing new, but Knives Out manages to pull it off with incredible ease.

The bits about the blood drop and the recording -- just lazy.Family characters needed to be deliciously malicious but instead seem pretty grubby, seem pretty much labels for lecture examples. Their collective helplessness and incompetence may create sympathy for the hero (sort of a plaster saint that vomits) but it doesn't make for satisfying drama.What saves the film? Proper mystery sets, some fair game criticism of elitism and xenophobia, and efforts by very capable actors working with a script that wants to be ""knives out"" but is more like...well, there's a prop at one point in the film...See it?

An all star cast like this is usually a red flag for me that the story is going to be weak and I wasn't surprised. The Dialogue and characters are all super pretentious, and don't speak like real people so it's hard to care at all what happens. The twists feel cheap and unearned and sometimes it feels like things that are setup are never paid off in satisfying ways. Overall, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! Major Pass!",Knives Out

The acting was horrible(Don Johnson, seriously buddy time to hang it up.) They revealed the killer half way through the movie, which made the rest of the movie watching everyone else trying figure it out. It was almost predictable when the old man left all his belongings to his nurse. I have never watched any of Daniel Craig's Bond movies but I certainly hope he's better in them then he is in this train wreck. I only gave it three stars because it was cool to see Chris Evans play a jerk. Two hours of my life that I won't get back with this one",Knives Out

1551,sunsetsymphony,Loved the trailer; underdelivered in comparison,7,19 June 2020,"The trailer in the movie theater was absolutely delightful. I could not wait to see this film because of it. Unfortunately, I found the chemistry between the characters to be a bit empty and superficial. It's difficult to achieve depth of character with such a large cast, but regardless, they could have focused much more on character development and interaction. For one, Daniel Craig's accent really threw me off and just personally didn't like it much. His character development seemed strange to me, as if he were conveying being a little bit dumb and highly intelligent at the same time, which doesn't correspond well with his big Sherlock-style reveal at the end. I did find some things funny and was mildly entertained, but not nearly as intrigued or engaged as the trailer made me believe I would be. 7/10 for the general story, entertainment, some acting, but heavily lacking in making each character not feel so one-dimensional, in my opinion.",Knives Out

Well filmed, with a great choice of house to set it in, well decorated - especially a circular knives decoration.No spoilers, but the plot does have some crazy twists and turns.

The acting is great, and Daniel Craig represents an imposing, but at times comedic detective.

Rian Johnson pens down an amazingly well written screenplay featuring a standout performance from Daniel Craig and electrifying acts from Chris Evans and Ana de Armas breathing life into a genre that has been struggling to take off for quite some time.

I absolutely love it, from the unique yet believable characters to the intriguing location filled with new details to notice every time you watch to Daniel Craig's accent and Chris Evan's sweater.

1574,cameronthorne,Better Than Expected,8,29 December 2019,"After watching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" I had little hope for upcoming Rian Johnson films, and then the trailer for ""Knives Out"" came out. I knew I would watch this movie, but it still seemed that Rian Johnson was trying too hard to recover from the bombshell that ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was. After watching ""Knives Out"" however, I was surprised, even if he was trying too hard to makeup for ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" it certainly paid off. ""Knives Out"" was an engaging and funny movie including a stellar performance from Daniel Craig (although his accent caught me off guard at the start). It paid homage to the ""Whodunnit"" genre but I do not think it was ""A Whodunnit Like No One Has Ever Dunnit"". I felt several moments of the film were very predictable. and cheesy, but is still an overall fun movie.""Knives Out"" follows Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) who was the ""murderer"" in the movie. We later find out she didn't kill Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) and it was all a set-up from Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans). Chris Evans character was entertaining to watch, but writing for his characters dialogue was extremely cheesy and momentarily cringe... MOMENTARILY. Besides his characters introduction and the cafe scene with Marta, Ransom or ""Hugh"" was a good and entertaining character, a great attempt for Chris Evans to be known as Chris Evans not Captain America. Another negative about the movie include ""Hugh did it"" which was frankly an unintentionally laughable moment in the movie.All movies have their flaws, and luckily this movies pros outweighed their cons. The cinematography was fitting for the story, helping immerse. the audience in the story, especially paired with the score. The twist was creative and its comedy didn't seem unnecessarily, unlike most modern movies.The movie knew what it was and followed one overarching theme,""Knives Out"" was entertaining and probably the best movie experience you will have this year.8/10",Knives Out

1582,rohinigottipati,A buoyant mystery,8,6 March 2020,"Watching a thriller was never this delightful without being nail-biting or too dependent on the stereotypically eerie background score to ""elevate"" suspense.Crime/suspense thrillers are known to throw in frivolous details and then sweeping out the viewer with the plot making them forget their hunches (if any) and then those same details come to play to help solve the mystery in the end or the help explain why they are there in the first place (Chekhov's gun technique)A good thriller has the most unexpected endings/ plot twists depsite tipping the viewers (sometimes misleading) to make them feel like they know what's been going on all along. Teasing them and catching them off-guard despite giving them the whole knowledge of the events. This movie did exactly that and more, taking the story to a whole another plane.
Having watched a good deal of suspense thrillers, I suspected that missing of Naloxene wasn't just a mistake and there was more it to it than just an honest mistake of Martha, and Ransom's involvement in Harlan's murder, with his name being the innuendo (this sounds absurd). But they deft-handedly weaved the whole chronicle giving the satisfaction of big reveal in the end. Had it been just an honest screw-up by Martha (which it most convincingly depicts itself as) and an awkward cover-up henceforth, would have made this one just another plain-vanilla prosaic picture. But the clandestine sketches and the generous offer of Harlan at the right time and strange idiosyncrasies like Martha's gag reflex to lying etc..make this movie more blithely amusing.P.S: My '9' is the standard '10' and my '8' is the standard '9'",Knives Out

There was indeed ill intent, but in the end it didn't seem to matter that the young protagonist did not check the label, and thereby confusing the old man's into his demise. I'm sorry, but that is just ridiculous. All characters were stereotypes, and beyond a few exceptions like Don Johnson, they were all easily disposable. No one unfortunately more so than the lead, who although relatable and sweet lacked any opportunities to show her acting skills beyond the deer in the headlight look. Daniel Craig was admittedly amusing, but over-acting ad nausea comes to mind.Sometimes you can tell very early on that a movie is pretentious and nonsensical, I should have heeded my own advice and cut my losses while i was ahead.

Without spoiling anything, I'll say that you never feel like you're trying to figure out who the culprit of the crime is. The ending was sloppy and rushed. It didn't contribute to the actual plot and it felt like an add-in.They advertised this film as a love song to Agatha Christie, but I disagree.

Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson as Linda and Richard Drysdale, along with their son Ransom (Chris Evans), all flawlessly depicted the close-knit and favored relatives. Jamie Lee Curtis nailed the representation of the preferential oldest sibling complete with the constant and the arduous seeking of parental approval, staying very close to her father.Michael Shannon is Walt Thrombey who is the brother who tries so hard, yet perhaps falls short of expectations, along with his two free-spirited offspring Jacob and Donna (Jaeden Martell and Riki Lindhorne).

In full, this clan is a hand-full!Rian Johnson the writer and director quintessentially and observantly captures each of the eccentric personalities featuring the all too common familial competitive rivalry, jockeying, over-indulgence and familiar grievances we all unfortunately recognize especially with large, complex families of considerable wealth and influence. Rian Johnson valiantly addresses matters with intellectual superiority, unpredictability yet familiarity, antidotes replete with modern day societal concerns that he heroically drops directly into the main conflict like a bomb, forcing audiences to grapple with its consequences.

Daniel Craig's accent in this movie is my only complaint as it was annoying and unauthentic in parts. The main characters are funny and entertaining throughout and give you a truly enjoyable cinema experience.

The actors were decent so it wasn't really an acting issue. Overall I felt the movie was celebrating its own cleverness the entire time. Of course when you celebrate your own cleverness it usually means you're not half as clever as you think you are.I understand there were some sociopolitical undertones that meant a lot to some folks. The sociopolitical commentary was less than subtle and pretty much just ended up being virtue signaling.

By the end of the movie it felt heavy and artificial. I was more annoyed than surprised.""Relevant"" jokes were sometimes cringy, and they certainly will not age well.

It borrows heavily from some of the best detective works of all time (Agatha Christie's ""Curtain"" and ""The Murder of Roger Aykroyd"" come to mind), and I do not mean that as an insult.The acting is top notch, as you would expect from this cast, but I enjoyed the cinematography as well. And the director plays fair with the audience - it's possible to guess the full final solution to the mystery, but that does not take away from the enjoyment of watching the characters get there.The real triumph of the movie, however, is Daniel Craig's portrayal of private investigator Benoit Blanc. Craig plays him like a Southern Hercule Poirot - bumbling on the surface, but observant with a keen intellect and a flair for the dramatic. I would rather see Craig play this character again than play James Bond - and that's no insult to his portrayal of Bond.",Knives Out

This was however a big disappointment. The warring family were uniformly horrible; I suppose they were meant to be, but they portrayed it so well that it was just unpleasant to watch. Daniel Craig has been an excellent Bond (and earlier, very good as Francis Bacon's lover), but here he was just awkward and his accent pretty ridiculous.
There was plenty of humour, which was OK at times, but overall that just meant that the film didn't seem to know whether it was a comedy or a serious story.
The worst bit was the long final denouement part, which was incredibly verbose and convoluted. I wasn't left feeling sad, happy, satisfied, intrigued or even angry - just flat. Avoid this film.",Knives Out

1620,lf780,Not bad but certainly overrated,5,9 March 2020,"Add me to the list of people who went into this with high expectations (after having read so much praise about it) and came out of it utterly disappointed.In terms of production value, it's not a bad movie -- good cinematography, genre-appropriate production design, suitable music, big-name cast (though heavily underused) and so on.But what matters most in this genre is a good story, a clever crime and cues that give viewers something to think about throughout the film, and a resolution that puts all the pieces of the puzzle together and provides a satisfactory conclusion. Sadly, the opposite happens here.The story doesn't know what it wants to do and feels like four different drafts of a script were mashed into one. It begins like the classic whodunnit where you have a whole group/family of suspects, all of them with motives, and you need to figure out who's lying and why -- except that after the introduction of all the family members, most of them get tossed aside and will only be cardboard characters without much significance for the rest of the movie.Instead, the second part now shifts the focus to the young nurse who found the deceased family patriarch (who happened to be a famous author of, you guessed it, crime novels). And we get to spend about 45 minutes only with the nurse's part of the story -- and the mystery behind the death is revealed. It was all just an accident with some switched medication, but in his dying moments, the patriarch decides to make it look like a suicide in order to protect his beloved nurse friend because she's an immigrant and her mother could get deported and so on and on.At this point, a viewer with high expectations is thinking ""okay, no, it can't be this simple? The nurse is probably playing a long con and has only pretended to accidentally switch the medication... or maybe the crime author is playing a game with her and just faking it all because, after all, we've never seen a closeup of the dead body, nor the funeral, nor his actual death...""Sadly, this is not where the movie is going. Instead, the third part of this script mashup begins and the one remaining family member who hasn't been ruled out completely by this point conveniently shows up and becomes part of the story -- and he's such an ass in such a non-subtle way that a viewer with high expectations is praying to the crime story gods that Rian Johnson will have something better up his sleeve than what he's telegraphing in this part of the story -- but, nope. It turns out, this ass whom we've barely seen throughout the first half of the movie did indeed want the family patriarch dead and had a hand in this not-so-accidental switch of medication.Which leads us to the final part of the script, in which Rian Johnson desperately tries bring this mess to a good conclusion -- and fails. By now, everything is way too convoluted: It was an accident that turned into a fake suicide that turned out to have been an attempted murder that eventually led to a real murder of the family's housemaid who had figured out the real murderer (who had actually only attempted the murder) and therefore invited him into a deserted laundromat (because that's definitely where you want to meet alone with a killer!) where he wanted to kill her but he once again messed up and didn't properly kill her so she was still alive when the nurse arrived in order to meet with someone blackmailing her about the crime she hadn't committed, and she saves the housemaid's life but as a consequence has to turn herself in for a crime she didn't commit only for the detective to suddenly figure it all out and the not-yet-an-actual-killer giving them a detailed confession right before the housemaid dies in the hospital so that we now have a real murder and a real confession from an actual killer.... or something.If you thought this last paragraph was impossible to follow along and annoyingly written, then congrats, that's like how I felt when the detective gave his endless monologue at the end of the movie explaining the whole crime.Long story short: This movie isn't well written. It's not the entertaining detective story/whodunnit mystery that it wants to be. At its core, it's yet another story about a patriarch changing his last will and getting killed by a disgruntled heir. But this simple plot is buried under a convoluted mess of coincidences and side-plots that don't really matter much in the end.The biggest mystery of ""Knives Out"" is why so many people praised it and why it's even getting a sequel. When that comes out, I'll be watching something else.",Knives Out
1621,avatarcolin,Not overhyped,9,24 November 2019,"Saw this tonight at an early screening. The writing is truly brilliant. Everything that happens is for a reason and really shows how much of a masterclass filmmaker Rian Johnson has become. The story is fun and engaging and always keeps you on your toes. The acting is also great. Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans are standouts. Daniel and Chris are very different characters to what they normally play and that's super fun to see. The family dynamics and politics is on point and hilarious. If you dig murder mysteries, you'll love this. Without going into spoilers, the storytelling is dynamic and I think it treats the audience with respect while also having a lot of misdirection and twists. Highly recommend.",Knives Out
1622,lindaoksanen,Overhyped,6,11 April 2020,Really expected a future classic movie. Instead it seemed like a waste of potential when you have such a impressive cast. And Daniel Craig come on! That southern accent was just ridiculous! Wasn't really a murder mystery either. But well ok it was watchable,Knives Out
1623,rfub94,Wow! Best movie of 2019,10,1 December 2019,"Let's be honest this year has been full of stinkers. It Chapter 2 was a near three hour comedy. Terminator Dark Fate bombed because it told the same story. The Irishman was painfully boring and overrated. Even Joker was overhyped, I liked it a lot but I don't think it's really a classic. But here comes Knives Out one of the best murder mystery comedies in recent memory.Pros: for one, it's very well shot. On a technical aspect the camera work and the way it's shot is great. The acting is superb nobody was bad in this movie not even Daniel Craig, his character was supposed to be over the top so I get the complaints about his southern accent but I thought he was great. The story was very clever, full of twists and turns that just left me guessing until the end. The small things such as the immigration theme and the vomiting all come into play and are very necessary to the plot. It's a typical murder mystery where you're trying to find the real killer along with the detectives. The dialogue was sharp and witty, very witty. I get it Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars for some, get over it he made one bad movie, he's really an awesome filmmaker. Don't hate this movie because it was made by a guy that ruined your franchise.Cons: I guess the social commentary wasn't necessary, I mean Hollywood just loves social commentary in almost everything. It gets annoying but it wasn't that bad, it didn't ruin the movie at all. In fact it was crucial to the plot. The southern accent by Daniel Craig was also hard to get used to at first, but when you learn his character is supposed to be over the top you get over it and you can't help but love his character.Best movie of 2019 and probably one of the best movies I've seen in theaters in a long time.

1634,jakem376,Star studded cast but not what you expect,6,15 May 2020,"I love murder mysteries I think they're fantastic and there's so much you can do with a murder mystery but this film sort of lacked the whole mystery part of the film.The cast is brilliant, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Daniel Craig and so many more. Daniel Craig's character is brilliant apart from his ridiculous accent, his portrayal of Blanc is brilliant he's a brilliant detective so can solve any crime and being a film set in the modern era, they could have made this film really extravagant but it seemed to miss out.I won't explain the whole film but the gist is the granddad cut his own throat because he thought his nurse over dosed him on morphine. With most murder mysteries you don't find out who killed the victim
Till the end which keeps up the excitement but you found out he killed himself within about 45 minutes and it was pretty lame how it happened.Turns out that the black sheep of the family Chris Evans' character Ransome actually was behind the whole thing, this was very predictable because throughout the film he was shown as the bad guy so it wasn't a shock when you find out that he is behind it all. I must admit it is pretty clever how Blanc figured it all out and the Sherlock Holmes side of the film comes out and it was pretty good to watch.If you want to watch a film that will knock your socks off this isn't for you but if you want a cosy night in film then it's ideal.",Knives Out

The plot is so overly contrived it REEKS of tryhard.The point of a mystery is to be solved or at least attempted to be solved. It makes the viewer interact all the more with the movie. This is possible when the clues are not too much for it to be too obvious or too scarse to be impossible. Then he goes to foreshadow the guilty person but nope!, guess what, that mystery is already solved within half an hour and, wait a minute, another mystery is rising!, wait, now?, yes, and it's impossible to solve but hey, good detective that seemed useless 90% of the movie turned out to know everything from the start, well how good is that.......This is anything but a whodunit.

After some more watching, I got the impression that is a combination of Murder on the Orient Express and Cluedo board game.A highly entertaining title. You do not have time to get bored.

1660,therealcliffbooth,"Enjoyable ""who done it"" mystery worthy of a few Oscar nods",8,30 December 2019,"This is the type of original film that I like to see come out of Hollywood, and it's a shame there aren't more original films of this quality being made. It's worthy of Oscar nods for Best Picture, Writing (Original Screenplay), and Film Editing. With that said I rate it a 7 (definite rent, might watch it again, easy to recommend to others) for a few reasons. First, I think the replay value on Knives Out is fairly low after you've seen it once due to the fact that it's a ""who done it"" mystery film. Once you know ""who done it"" and the various twists and turns involved, I'm not so sure it's as riveting with repeated viewings. Second, despite a star studded cast the only performance that impressed me was by Ana de Armas as the sympathetic Marta. I'm not sure if Daniel Craig's supposed to have a cajun accent or a more standard southern accent, but whatever it is it's not very good. His detective character is very well written though, so I was able to tolerate the accent. Chris Evans does a nice job of playing the unlikeable rich and spoiled grandson even though he only seems to show up for the last third of the film. Michael Shannon, and Christopher Plummer are always impressive and are solid in their limited screen time, but Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette seem almost non-existent. I had a little trouble with Detective Blanc adopting Marta as a sort of Dr. Watson, and Marta's illness for lying seems a little too convenient for the story, but everything else about the screenplay and editing is so tight that I was able to overlook those two items as me just nitpicking.

the acting was pretty good. daniel craig wasn't too pretentious (though he was still pretty pretentious 'cos he's a genius detective so he has to be)the pacing was great, the story flowed. sometimes i forgot the plot was boringthe cuts of different times were nicely done and made it more interestingoverall, a well made movie with a bad script. easy to watch, but definitely not life-changing.",Knives Out

This is a somewhat classical detective story that features a fantastic cast, however it often lacks the 'family' part, by basically focusing on just a few of the characters. This can also lead to many figuring out who is really involved, and who simply plays the supporting cast.In terms of story and development, I would give this movie an 8/10, however the overuse and underuse of some characters, plus some obvious twists brings us to 7/10.

The script would have worked just as well without it. After the first fifteen minutes you know who the good guys are, who the bad guys are and basically how the movie is going to end all because of the politics that have needlessly put into the movie.

1687,aenvn,^_^,6,9 May 2020,"After watching the trailer of the film, I think that this film should be able to enter my top ten of the year. Perhaps the expectations are too high. After watching it, I do not rate it high. Clockwork said that the director is also Agatha's iron fan, so my score is still low. Agatha is one of my favorite reasoning novelists, and one is a ghost horse star. In fact, the first half of the film was completely Agatha's tone, and I was very excited to watch it, as if the scene of the novel was reproduced, but then it became tasteful. I think a good reasoning movie should be logically impeccable or the plot is pushed very fast, so you do n't have to worry about its rationality. And the most important thing to reason about the movie is the ending. If the whole movie is OK, the ending is a bright spot, it will also improve the score a lot, just like ""Tuner"". This movie does not have these points.
If you shoot in Agatha 's style, one should be that the old man has a friend. In the letter to the friend, he mentioned that he suspected that someone wanted to murder him, so he wanted to test it. On his birthday, he put everyone Enraged because he is a writer of reasoning novels, leaving clues when he dies. Another thing is that all things are arranged by the old man, so that his children will be touched during this reasoning process and change them through death. In the movie watching, I always thought it was the latter, because the old man angered everyone in his birthday feast, and then explained to everyone that you will understand. According to the movie, it doesn't make sense. If the end of the movie is processed as everything planned by the female lead, it will add a lot of points.",Knives Out

If anything, Daniel Craig's Kentucky Fried accent will make you giggle more than once.The plot is deceptive and obvious all at once and makes for a good ride. Just when you think you have it all, there is more. Even when you think it is all over there is still more....and the laughs continue as well.I really enjoyed ""Knives Out"" for it's change of pace.

The biggest problem is that every one of the characters turns out to be just like the prejudices you are supposed to hold against them upon the first glance. People are just good or (most of them) evil.

I'm so glad I didn't listen.Rian Johnson's Knives Out is a perfectly entertaining thriller/mystery movie, with an all-star cast, a compelling and intriguing plot, and a very poor accent from Daniel Craig. That being said, the minor plot holes and slip-ups this movie inevitably has are no excuse to give it a low rating, as its job is accomplished with fluency and elegance. I was interested the whole way through, and even if the ending wasn't the biggest plot twist in the world, I found the first and second act to be even bigger plot twists which more than made up for it.All in all, the movie delivers on an entertaining, not-so-family-friendly mystery that should leave you walking out satisfied. I'm happy to see the movie's true ratings are coming out as we speak and they are getting higher and higher. This is worth your time and money.",Knives Out

1728,oscarelliott8,Underwhelming whodunnit,5,6 November 2021,I love a well setup whodunnit where breadcrumbs and misdirections are offered to the audience with varying levels of significance throughout the film leading up to an intelligent thought out reveal of the overall arc. This was the exact opposite of that but I'll give it up because they did get me I've never seen a film or a tv show where the person who did the crime is the most obvious person throughout with all of the blatant evidence pointing to them so much so that you think it couldn't be possibly be them because that's too obvious an interesting move but when you take a step back it really is just an awful premise where the person most likely to have committed the crime who was heard arguing with the victim that night and the person who all the circumstantial evidence pointed to actually did do it. I like a good mystery and it certainly is a good one how this ever got made in its current form (great cast great title),Knives Out

It was dark, it was hilarious, and there were phenomenal performances from the whole cast, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans.

1730,hitn,Expect the unexpected,10,6 January 2020,"Knives Out is pitch-perfect indeed, inscribing itself in the annals as one of the best mystery movies of all time. Reminiscent of the board game Clue (referenced in the movie), the mansion where most of the film is set subconsciously creates an atmosphere of suspense itself, a suspense that is developed and deepened by the stunning chiaro-oscuro lighting.The actors play their roles beautifully, with an especially good performances from the grandfather (Christopher Plummer), the daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis) and of course the detective (Daniel Craig), whose accent starts out as forced but ends up contributing to the film's paradoxically whimsical nature.Finally, the writing is exceptional. As with any murder mystery, expect twists. Unlike any other murder mysteries these days however, expect to be genuinely taken by surprise.A particularly entertaining film and a must see!",Knives Out

1734,jason-needs,Average murder mystery with early reveal,4,7 December 2019,Not sure why this film has critical acclaim. Pretty average and the who done it bit is revealed quite early. At times I thought there must be more to this and considering the overly long running time - surely it was building to a jaw dropping twist. Not really. The odd bits to reveal who else might have a hand in it are hardly surprising. The large cast is for the most part superfluous and add very little. Most are clearly not involved. Craig's sleuth isn't is as clever as you think he should be and plays second fiddle to the female lead. The only interesting thing was the 1972 Sleuth references with the elaborate house interior and the sailor man mannequin similar to Jolly Jack.,Knives Out

The movie always had me on my toes. Always guessing the next step which is hard to find in productions today. It didn't need an action. The story arc was just brilliant. However, this movie is not fit for pure souls. I had no intention of watching the rest of the production whence Marta was declared the reason for his death.",Knives Out
1737,charlo-30,"Whodunnit? This movie, I mean, because it's amazing!!!",10,6 December 2019,"Knives Out is, as you have probably heard, the latest gem by Rian Johnson (Looper, Star Wars: The Last Jedi) and tells the story of a rich family mourning the lost of their father (or grand father or else) who now finds itself, all of the sudden, at the center of a big investigation led by Benoit Blanc, who doesn't even know who hired him, to resolve the possible crime of the patriarcal figure, Harlan Thrombey.This movie takes the whodunnit genre and turns it on itself completely, or formula-wise at least. It shifts the focus of it's plot and makes it a great guessing game, as any movie of this genre should be, but you find yourself, at the midway point, not guessing what you thought you would be. Johnson is misleading you where he wants to but not doing so in a mean-spirited way (to lose you completely if I must say) but in a way where it just gets you where you need to be in the end to fully enjoy the story in it's entirety. Also, I was anticipating the performance by Ana De Armas and, safe to say, she didn't disappoint, with her brilliant subtlety in the showing of her raw emotions, backed by a complete internal understanding of the character and her background. Every actor is on point and perfectly casted here but she was the standout for me.The world building and character development by Rian Johnson is amazing and it is, as always, so refreshing to give money to an original concept in Hollywood!!! The direction is also incredible, and even though I like to analyze movies on 2nd and subsequent viewings, the camera work was so astonishing here that I had to analyze it and gaze at it for most of the film. It makes you feel the tension when it needs to, the anxious confrontation with the truth (that a murder mystery brings) when it's necessary and the kindness when it's earned. The score is also mind-buzzing and perfectly fitted for this genre, so I do not know who you are Nathan Johnson but good job!!!In the end, the story is upbeat and modernizes/revolutionizes the genre, the characters are great and amazingly built, the direction is probably one of the best this year, the effects are entertaining and beyond and the score is remarkable, and I'm forgetting a lot too. I'm not a professionnal critic or anything, but this is clearly the best movie of the year for me!!! 10/10",Knives Out

You go in expecting one thing, but it turns into something completely different - and in the best way possible.

It does fall into the realm of a ""who done it"", but given the list of actors I certainly expected a lot more. Virtually zero character development. Daniel Craig's role was completely miscast.

But that didn't damper the movie or the ending at all. We found it to be a great story line and wonderfully acted.The one plot hole that we couldn't get past was Marta thinking he had injected him with 100mg of morphine. In her mind, as a nurse, enough to kill him in 10 minutes. However had she actually injected him with morphine he would have felt the effects immediately.

The director makes you see most of the clues through the eyes of the detective but like an illusionist and a master of misdirection it hides hints in front of you, which just keeps you engaged and motivated to look at everything through the detective's lens. Great acting and very entertaining!",Knives Out
1760,jenisedong,A thrill from beginning to end,9,1 January 2020,"What a ride! Knives Out is thriller featuring dramatic shots, dark humor, and fun music.I absolutely love thriller/crime movies so I was expecting quite a lot from this movie and boy it didn't disappoint. The star studded casts acting is wonderful and incredibly natural. There are plenty of family fighting scenes in the movie that subconsciously display how well the actors have fit into their rolls and emotions.The story is very much like an Agatha Christie classic with a little bit more humor and informality. The twist in the movie at the end and the many surprises throughout make this film not only fun but incredibly engaging. Another thing that's worth pointing out is that the movie's deeper color palette, music, and overall personas mimic some 80s movie trends, which is an interesting way to approach a very modern crime story filled with 21st century references.Overall this film was exciting, twisting, and surprisingly unpredictable.*At this point forward there will be plenty of spoilersHarlan's death really doesn't seem plausible if you think back on exactly what Marta said. After Marta thinks she poisoned Harlan with an absurd amount of morphine, she tells him that he will die in around 10 minutes and will feel symptoms almost automatically. Harlan doesn't seem to have felt anything in the about 5 minutes when he explained to Marta his master plan and gave her the encouragement to carry it out. That's strange right?Any sane person would probably question why they weren't feeling any symptoms and wait a little longer before acting rashly and committing suicide, Harlan most definitely didn't. On the other hand, it would make more sense if Harlan realized he wasn't overdosed, checked the drugs again with Marta, and concluded that somebody was trying to frame Marta or secretly murder him.Another thing I feel like the film didn't clear up very well was the blood on Marta's shoe. I can understand that the blood spurted out of Harlan and landed on Marta right before she was about to leave, but just one speck? I don't know about you but that definitely feels a little fishy to me; it makes me think that maybe Marta purposely placed some blood on her shoe to attract the Detective's attention and force herself into a suspect position so she can be closer to the action and the development of theories - more information means it's easier to defend herself.The last things I want to talk about is the mention of the game Go throughout the film. Go is all about strategy, defense, and misleads. It is mentioned that Marla is the superior Go player, evidently defeating Harlan more times than Ransom. I believe this symbolizes that even though Ransom was coming up with this master plan to get Harlan's will, at the end Marta was always going to beat him because of her displayed manipulative skills in Go.Oh and also I would like to say that I absolutely despise Benoit Blanc's southern accent, why didn't they go with a British accent, it would sound so much more professional!",Knives Out

Daniel Craig leads an all star cast of characters as a Detective with a southern drawl and many other big names such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and more build up a set of quirky suspects to the murder of the Family patriarch (Christopher Plummer). Each of them have a motive and it's up to Craig to find the culprit. Some interesting information is revealed much earlier than expected and from there Rian Johnson subverts our expectations again and again (more successfully than in Star Wars) creating a pretty great 'Clue' like mystery that keeps you on your toes with Plenty of laughs and a standout performance from Daniel Craig. 8/10",Knives Out

I think that's because johnson's writing let's the viewer believe they know everything there is to know very early on and you onyl realise how much there was by the end.even if this does make the twist ending all the more surprising, it doesn't keep the viewer that motivated to get to the end in my experience.",Knives Out

But another without a doubt Amazing thing about this movie is the amazing Ensemble Cast, all of them acted really good. One of my favourite Scenes is definitely the Car Chase because it is pretty good staged and looks good too. Plus the Costumes and the Score is good as well.",Knives Out
1792,huluhoopjones,Worth a watch.,6,18 May 2020,"The movie does keep you guessing but has needless politics. It eats up time and does nothing for the plot. The characters are kind of interesting, greed as the main motivation for almost every single one and gets tiresome. If you want to play detective give this a chance. I will never watch this again, but don't regret renting it.",Knives Out
1793,average_reviewer,Brilliant and Extremely Clever,9,25 June 2020,"First off, Daniel Craig's character is awesome I think. This movie is just so much fun and has serious re-watch value. I've watched it 3 times in the last week and keep picking up on cleverly added details that I missed the times previous.The writing is top-notch, the acting is top-notch, and the characters are fantastic and hilarious and believable all at the same time.The only reason I didn't rate this a 10/10 is because I think it had too much language. I'm not a fan of language in movies, but this one had a lot for PG-13 I thought.That being said, I can't wait for the next one to come out and I will probably see this movie many more times before it does!This is also the first review I've written for a movie - I think it's that good.",Knives Out
1794,dajohnstondj,Not all it's cracked out to be,6,6 September 2020,"Knives Out was a pretty smug and adolescent effort by Rian Johnson. Its penchant for cartoonish acting and obnoxiously out-of-place camera work that I could have sworn I've seen done better in other movies, I found the movie annoying more than entertaining.The biggest crime is the culprit of this ""whodunit"" was who I thought it was in the first place. The movie spends a large portion trying to be clever and cover up its tracks with a red herring plotline, but that wasn't enough to build up to any good surprise. What it boiled down to was: ""oh that's right, who I thought it was in the first place.""The movie tries to shoehorn in some political commentary but never really goes anywhere with it or makes any significant impact.The final 20 minutes felt rushed and sloppy, delegated to a flashback recap.If you're already spoiled by great mystery and suspense cinema, there's a chance you'll end up like me and not get the hype.If you're a casual moviegoer that doesn't really spend much time exploring cinema and you're easily impressed by that plastic Hollywood gloss, maybe you'll love this deceptively elaborate piece.",Knives Out
1795,havefungum,The script is great,9,18 June 2020,I think what makes a good movie is the script. If the story is good then the movie will be as well.

1801,J_M_Manson,Meh,5,15 September 2020,If you watch these kind of movies it's too cliche. It's too long. Cast is good. The cliche part actually didn't bother me.The problem is characters in this movie are not well written based on its script. Harlan the rich man bequeathed his entire estate to Marta but there is no actual reason for that. His children are not that bad and even he admitted his mistakes. Let's say he changed his mind and he wanted to give some things to Marta.Why not Linda or Meg but Marta? He didn't give anything to Linda or Meg.

The actors are under used...Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson are barely in it. Daniel Craig does his best Foghorn Leghorn impression (heres a hint: if the character is southern GET A SOUTHERN ACTOR!)

Masterfully directed, well edited giving all the ensemble characters they can get their teeth into. What starts as a simple murder mystery soon turns when us as viewers get all the information we need right at the start of the film.
Spoilers bit, sorry;🙏
I did think it was a bit heavy handed the way none of the family knew the country Marta was from leading us to the fact although they keep telling her she is part of the family very few know even the most basic details about her life.

To me they just drag on and on and on. Too much talking and theorizing. I usually fall asleep. Or leave the room to work on my arts and crafts.Also, with the close-up of the medicine bottles in the beginning I knew someone had switched the morphine. At first I thought it was Harlan. The bottle switch was an obvious PLOT POINT. To it's credit, Knives Out has some humorous moments and the acting is good.Did all those old actors have on wrinkly makeup? If not, they need to start using facial moisturizer and SPF sunscreen. Toni Collette especially looked awful.",Knives Out

1815,keithfiction4,Total Miss,3,24 August 2020,"If you like BBC lighthearted mysteries, old Miss Marple movies, clever whodunnits, etc, forget this movie. Narration over many scenes, almost all the action recast as flashback, detective is a funny part but Craig couldn't pull it off--totally miscast, Main character vomits a lot. I got the feeling the writer imagined it totally differently. If you are doing a lot of vomit scenes for comedy, then really it was supposed to be over the top humour. I've seen dozens of fun clever movies much better than this one. I mean, even sort of weak TV shows with funny detectives solving crimes have better scripts. All the great actors are not well used and don't give good performances, so maybe that's the director who is responsible for that.",Knives Out
1816,LussvonTrier,Well.. it's hard to go against public opinion but I gotta be honest.,1,24 November 2019,"Knives Out is an okay movie. There are so many haters of this film rating it 1-stars just because they don't like Rian Johnson and what he did to the Star Wars: Last Jedi apparently and a lot of others who rate it 10-stars to revoke the 1-star ratings. But the movie is basically ok. And I'm sad to acknowledge it as I really, really wanted to like it. I mean c'mon look at the cast!Knives Out is ok for basic entertainment when you don't have anything else to do and just want to have fun at the movies but it has soooo many plot holes and insults to the viewer that I can't just close my eyes on them.You know there's this saying that if you start explaining the joke then it's not funny. It's about this movie exactly! They do so much explaining that your brain hurts. It's basically an insult because I kinda sat there and felt that there shouldn't have been so much explaining. I mean sometimes you gotta trust the audience. That they'll get it. This is either inconfidence in yourself or in the audience. There's at least like 15 minutes of the movie explaining itself and what's going on but they could've done it in a more subtle way with hints, looks and feels. Not with words. The movie has so many shifts and turns that you kinda look at it funnily. And not only the plot turns but also the movie and genre itself. It's almost like it's not as self-aware.This might be one of the very few times that I'll say I didn't like the acting in an American film. They all are great actors and Americans are somehow natural at this but this film didn't even require a whole lot of range from them. It relies on its script of a ""whodunit"" and beautiful cinematography and scenery to carry out the film. Actors were acting like in a play or smth. Do you remember those theatrical experience where acting is over-the-top? When it's just too much? There's a scene at the end where a man is trying to bribe a policeman by waving money in the air, in front of them, when everybody's looking. That's zero subtlety. You feel like you're getting spoon-fed smth that could've been done in a more serious fashion.When you turn 180 degrees, you're basically back at the same spot Rian. Quit turning.
It's a solid OK",Knives Out

I can't say more without adding spoilers, but I have to say that is film is a prime example how tight editing and dialogue can engineer a film's success.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Daniel Craig, Chris Evens, Christopher Plummer, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette and everyone else are all sensational.Movie is funny, shocking, emotional, and suspensful whenever it wants to be, and easily has THE BEST MURDER MYSTERY MOVIE REVEAL I have ever seen...even better then my now 2nd favorite Mystery Movie, Murder on the Orient Express.I do not want to give any spoilers, or clues away, so I will just say this movie is so much fun, you will laugh, and be held to the very end on the edge of your seat wondering what really is going.",Knives Out

1832,afroman_2301,Knives Out (2019) Review,8,8 April 2020,"Going into 'Knives Out'; I was sceptical about a murder mystery including all these big names and from first glance, looked like it was just, going to be okay. In spite of my assumption - when the film finished; I was instantly on the phone to my girlfriend and couldn't stop saying ""you have to watch this film!"". She then replied by saying ""that's nice honey (yawns)"" and then put the phone down. We thankfully watched it together and Gala - my wonderful girlfriend, really enjoyed it.We both loved the fact that it was a whodunit - bringing all the best elements of the genre and more. The way the narrative jumped around the basic foundation of a 'Agatha Christie type story' - had us second guessing every milestone and it was brilliant. I never knew what was round the corner of each clue - even if I thought I did. Everything was so clear but equally surprised me when something huge was revealed. It was both fun and tense - making Gala and I gasp at how amazingly well told the story was.As well as its great story and inventive screenplay, written by Johnson, we loved all the themes - particularly its stance on class and immigration. These two motifs had a very big, but unexpected impact, making it slightly political without trying too hard to be an obvious statement - giving us something quite unique and subtle. These political arguments are woven in through the dialogue and characters in a way that really brings out each persona to everyone present, in this twisting tale.All the performances are great - especially Daniel Craig's (Casino Royale) Benoit Blanc - with his unexpected Southern accent and humorous metaphors about donuts - putting a smile on our faces every time he walked onto set. Its hard to talk about all great performances and likably ironic characters, as they all have a part to play in this mystery solving adventure. However, Ana de Armas (Blade Runner 2049) gave a great performance as well as seeing Chris Evans (Avengers: Endgame) back to his old school - 'jock persona'. You can see he has really come a long way, since his debut as Captain America in 'Marvel's' 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.Even though this film has a big cast - I wasn't even conscious of the fact that they were all A'list actors. After the first ten minutes, I could honestly believe that they were all very real people such as; Michael Shannon (The Shape of Water) playing the creepy son of Christopher Plummer (All the Money in the World) - also, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Toni Collette (Hereditary); all played very different roles from previous appearances. Each and every one of their conversations were so engaging that you could really see what brilliant actors they all are. Each character ends up being able to show their true colours at some point in the film. When all of the craziness come to an end - theres a great message, relating back to the political undertone which was just as unanticipated as the whodunit reveal.What also gave 'Knives Out' its particular feel was the amazing production and set design by David Crank (The Master) and David Schlesinger (John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum), for their wonderfully intricate attention to detail - amazing collection on weird and quirky antiques which really brought the house to life. It was like breathing through the mind of a old and eccentric explorer. As well, Jenny Eagan's (Beasts of No Nation) beautiful costume design just had me dazzled in all its aesthetically pleasing bright colours that brought a thirties vibe with a modern twist giving a balance between a contemporary thriller and a generic mystery.'Knives Out' is a film I recommend very highly and is one of my favourite features of last year - if you are into a new spin on Christies' beloved classics and maybe need a break from Jessica Fletcher; this is the one for you.

1849,dick-fleischer,Smart!,8,9 January 2020,"Now that's what smart storytelling is all about! A very good ""whodunit"" like Death on the Nile. Daniel Craig is wonderful as the modern day Sherlock Holmes or Hercules Poirot.",Knives Out
1850,steveo554,A Surprisingly clever mystery that's not AS political as it seems,8,27 January 2020,"It's safe to assume that Rian Johnson polarizes people. He's a pretty decent writer who unfortunately can bog his script with some bad ideas. The ending of Looper and certain elements of The Last Jedi come to mind. However, his writing proves to be strong when everything works. And Knives Out works.A revival of the whodunit genre, Knives Out brings back some of the classic tropes of the murder mystery with a script that leaves little unused. A lot of elements, albeit not all, serve a purpose and come back to play an important part. Overall, I hope to see a franchise revolving around Benoit Blanc's cases.Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to solve the murder of a family patriarch (Christopher Plummer). The suspects include his children (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, and Michael Shannon), their loved ones (Don Johnson, Katherine Wilford) and the caretaker Marta (Ana de Alvas). The family members have their motives, but only one person is guilty of murder.The script takes the tropes of British mystery genres and gives them an American setting: the wealthy family members, an inheritance, the butler/maid, the rebellious children, and the gentleman detective. Daniel Craig really enjoys playing this role, and I wouldn't want to see anyone else play this. The movie does lag a bit in the middle, but you start to see everything come together in a way that really surprised me. A lot of pieces serve as obvious symbolism or even return as a Chekhov's gun, but that's the fun of the whodunit: you want to see how every piece is played. The game of Go, the knives, even the dialogue serve a purpose.So there's a caveat that needs to be addressed and others will find in this film: the movie makes some heavy political jabs. A character's son is described as an ""alt-right troll"" and a nazi; another character's daughter is an SJW; there's a scene where everyone is arguing about Trump and illegal immigration. I, too, am getting tired of woke cinema lecturing Americans about how to vote. Hollywood has been deep in the Democrats' coffers and has made it clear that Andrew Breitbart was right - politics IS downstream from culture. Yet, the political tones aren't really as deep as some here have made it. At least, I didn't get a sense of lecturing from this film. The argument exists because Marta's mom is undocumented, and it foreshadows how the family will come after her near the end. But even the liberal characters, lifestyle guru Joni and her daughter, aren't shown as sympathetic characters. The former acts virtuous with her diatribes about ""locking children in cages"", but even she will throw someone under the bus for money. The alt-right grandson and granddaughter show no real signs of these labels; if no one said anything, you wouldn't really know. And you understand that the victim's intentions weren't political at all. It would be one thing if Joni was depicted as the voice of reason or in the right as Rose was supposed to be, but she wasn't. And this needs to be highlighted.I've seen woke cinema - The Intern, BlacKkKlansman, Captain Marvel, The Last Jedi. Even the new Little Women makes woke statements. But if the phrase ""go woke, go broke"" works 8 times out of 10, Knives Out is in the lucky 20%. Just know that just because it throws politics around doesn't necessarily mean it's political.",Knives Out
1851,docmus-240-405250,It's more fun reading the 1 star reviews,1,20 June 2020,I thought this movie was supposed to be a mystery comedy. The only mystery was why it was made and the only comedy was Daniel Craig's unnecessary half hearted attempt at a southern accent. Having a plot in which not a single character has any resemblance to an actual human being is not funny - it's just stupid and boring. The horrible dim yellow green lighting and art direction throughout hurt my eyes. And one last thing not mentioned by any reviewers who either favoured or like me hated this waste of electrons - the accompanying score was the most unimaginative generic movie score I've ever heard.,Knives Out

1853,teksuremusic,Would have been an order of magnitue better without Johnston's warbled symbolism,6,26 February 2020,"The idea of it mattering more what you do with the truth than the pursuit of it is a clever one, but instead of shining a light on prejudice, bias, and arrogance, it actually encourages all of these things in the audience by confirming all of those things in the end instead of destroying them.We're led to hate everyone who deserves hating right off the bat, and that never changes. What's worse, the people we're led to find innocuous only become more so as the story progresses. In short nobody grows and it ends up being a somewhat terrible mystery. It gets points for twists and turns, but none of those happen because of changes in the characters behavior or outlook. Johnston put all of the characters in their place from the get-go and never let them even wiggle slightly.The acting saves this movie. It is definitely worth watching just for the magnificent performances by everyone involved. It is just sad that they had to 'pay the pound' for Johnston's gross soapboxing, while the penny was the movie and mystery itself.It's interesting that there was an attempt to make fun of both SJWs and Nazis in this, while it so blatantly implied that rich entitled Americans are everything bad and illegal immigrants are everything good and hard-working.

The direct political talk was, obviously, comedic relief. Hopefully even the densest of you got that. As for the underlying messages? Sure you could say that it is pushing a pro refugee narrative. But, ultimately, the decision to have Marta be an immigrant is entirely a plot device designed to help us connect with a character that we, otherwise, might not like. She was an outsider, had little to no friends and family, but worked hard and was kind above everything else. Yet, she wins in the end because of her good heart. Walk away from this movie with that message instead of being mad about an agenda that was hardly even pushed.Look I hated The Last Jedi. Hated it. I was nervous knowing that Johnson directed Knives Out. But this movie was very well done, funny while remaining serious and emotional, and empowering in the right way. It bashed greed and praised loyalty and love. So if you're hating this movie based on any politics that MIGHT have been in it, knock it off and grow up.Signed,

1869,alexlenceon,Simply brilliant,10,1 January 2020,"What a gear movie. This is probably one of the most brilliant detective movies of the recent years. To begin with, this movie does what each detective movie should do, namely, subversion of expectations. And it does it greatly at that.This movie begins with a simple murder mystery. At first, we are presented with a simple set of events, and we are left to guess who the murderer is. Seemingly, we manage to discover who that person is, and, unexpectedly, the movie actually shows us what happened. At this stage, we are left confused, since we are only in the first act, and yet we know who killed the guy. This makes us believe that the movie is not a murder mystery at all, but rather, a story about right and wrong, where we get to either side with the detective, or the murderer. Soon enough, however, we realize that perhaps there is something more to it. And sure enough, the story unravels in yet another direction, one that we've yet to discover.I find it simply brilliant how the movies keeps an incredible balance of atmosphere, mystery and humor. Writing a good murder mystery is very difficult, especially for fans of the genre, since there are only so many possible scenarios. However, this movie develops in a brand new direction, and it manages to achieve everything that it sets to achieve.Furthermore, this movie utilizes Chekhov's gun astonishingly. Usually, if we are shown a certain object in a mystery movie, we already know that it is going to play a role in solving the case. This is a good thing, since having redundant scenes in a limited screen time is not a good idea at all. However, camerawork is a tool just like dialogue or any other mean of conveying information, and thus it should be used carefully. This movie achieves to utilize this tool to a great scale without spoiling the plot or tipping us off, which in itself is achievement.To conclude with, the ending is very satisfying and it is probably one of the best mystery movie endings I've seen in a long time.",Knives Out

A nice character study, a nice plot, a very well thought off twist at the end.
And yet, in stead of delivering a time less master piece about a family and how they deal with a time of crisis, the movie get lost in contemporary politics.

I guess some heavy shilling happening here.I expected a nice, captivating murder-mystery going by the synopsis, and I've seen my fair share of them -- and the cast looked good too. Was it? Not at all.The overall best one-term description I can give this movie is ""dull"".While I understand the angle of trying to reconstruct things through interviews, it was presented plainly, dry and with no real attention to flow -- in fact, it felt very fragmented, often switching between characters without hints only causing confusion and preventing any sort of story flow, coherence or character development. Whomever edited this should be fired.
Daniel Craig's performance was also underwhelming to say the least.With the movie and story overall scoring in the ""mediocre"" range, pulled further down by these points, I end up on a solid 4 out of 10 -- hardly worth more for anyone being honest in their reviews, IMHO.",Knives Out

The acting is superb all around, but especially so for Daniel Craig who plays a southern dogged private investigator who will not give in until the case is solved. He did such a good job that the producers have signed Craig on for at least one more film for this unexpected franchise.

1884,nwolff-66348,"Mystery Lovers, Lower Your Expectations.",6,15 January 2020,"I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let's just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta's shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn't ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn't he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn't a bad watch, but I don't think I will be watching it again.",Knives Out

1887,Artylo,A Recommendation - Knives Out (2019),10,4 March 2020,"Knives Out is a film in which Rian Johnson, formerly of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Looper fame, redirects the main points of contention from his previous outings into a more suitable genre for his particular brand of directorial vision - a whodunit Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery. As such, the less one knows about it - the better, but since this is a recommendation, perhaps the deal needs to be sweetened, before you are fully convinced that the film is worth your time. What follows will probably diminish your viewing enjoyment.
Featuring a star-studded cast, Knives Out spins a delightful web of intrigue surrounding the sudden death of the eldest member of the Thrombey family - Harlan, a writer and proprietor of a publishing company as well as vast amounts of wealth. Contentions arise concerning his will and the distribution of inheritance, as things usually go.Through a series of interviews with his decedents, one begins to paint a picture of the events that transpired on that very night. Said interviews are so cleverly bolstered by the films clever editing scheme, displaying just enough information to keep you interested, but reward you for being observant as well. One could go as far to say that part of the subtle humor of the film is a direct consequence of one paying attention to details and remembering what seemed to be insignificant red-herrings beforehand. It is honest to god fun to see Rian Johnson subvert and twist away in a genre that was built on exactly that ever-shifting foundation, rather than more generic linear narratives. The amount of foreshadowing and Chekhov's guns littered around is nothing short of amazing, whenever the guns do in fact go off in the third act.The film isn't without action, as everyone scrambles to uncover the truth, usually getting themselves caught in situations they'd rather not be in. There are thrills and suspense waiting around every corner, as you begin to believe you've finally got it and a new lead opens up unexpectedly from the unlikeliest of sources.
This is no less a product of the film's wonderful script, which features clever word-play galore, giving everyone a wonderfully fleshed out persona with its own unique quirks and still maintaining a level of realism in their depiction as real people. The performances also lend themselves nicely to the often quippy nature of every line of dialogue. Many battles of wit are held with a level of wordsmanship that leaves you laughing or shivering on a constant basis.The film even pays homage to the pieces of media that inspired the genre in some less that subtle ways; like the single-color attire everyone seems to wear and the wildly different personalities, reminiscent of Clue (1985) or the bearded sailor dummy referencing 1972's Sleuth, and many more.
The soundtrack is frankly very traditional, in the way that it plays it straight, by relying mostly on orchestral strings and short spirts of piano. It serves its purpose well in establishing tension whilst also maintaining this ever-present whimsy, but regretfully falls on the not-so-memorable side of things. A fitting score, but probably not something you would be listening to in your free time.An overall fantastic time with a film that wraps up nicely, accomplishing everything that it set out to do. If not one of the best original screenplays of the year, it is definitely one with heart and a good sense of humor. A wonderful murder mystery that keeps you asking questions and rewards you for noticing its intricate details in a way that nothing has done for quite some time. Rian Johnson shows his true talent in flamboyant display of filmmaking, that will keep you enamored until the very end. Watch it!",Knives Out

I liked the cinematography, the characters and the acting a lot, even if Daniel Craig's accent got on my nerves a bit. It was really an enjoyable watch. But if I'm being honest the movie frustrated me, in that for the majority of the film it seemed to be solved in the first half hour. Of course, I knew straight away that what was being presented wasn't actually what happened, but it took a while for me to feel like everything was all heading in a direction and that's what was frustrating. As for complexity in the mystery, I had solved it a half hour before the ""big"" reveal. I also figured out the minor twists before they happened, like with the knife and the ink, because there were some pretty displaced clues and comments. Which in great mysteries, these clues would have been hidden well enough that you miss them the first time so that the twists and reveals are shocking, and the clues become apparent as you understand what happened or when you see the film a second time. But they were pretty obvious straight away in this film, that I predicted everything before they happened. So although this was a good mystery, it did not reach great. I like what they were trying to do, but they definitely thought it was cleverer than it actually was. Hence, sorry Rian Johnson, but you are no Agatha Christie.",Knives Out

All characters play an importance role- as everything connected and flowed together.",Knives Out
1895,stevetbrink,Old school mystery with twists on twists!,10,16 April 2020,Such a fun film. This is an old school who-dun-it with great acting and excellent plot twists. So refreshing to see a movie done in this day and age. What fun!,Knives Out
1896,jentzjess,Not that great...,6,2 December 2019,"Really surprised at how so many people love this movie. Although, all my friends I saw it with loved it too so...
To me the ""twist"" was super obvious from very early on. So then it just was really boring waiting for it to end.
Also, my friends liked the political back and forth but I did not find it engaging or even interesting. Maybe because my own family is very politically divided.
Lastly (and someone else said this in there review on here as well), the main detective was like Kevin Spacey doing Frank Underwood. Which with everything that has come out about Spacey, left me with a really uncomfortable feeling.
Also, fwiw, apparently there's a big Star Wars controversy thing going with the director but a) I didn't know any of that until after I saw it and b) I am not a Star Wars fan, so my opinion of the movie has zero to do with any of that drama.",Knives Out

And I seriously enjoyed this movie. While all the technical factors are judged by the critics I watched this movie as any regular person and the plot just was so intriguing that I watch the whole movie and I was impressed with the story. It was a full circle. Ended where it started.
I even waited for post credits but there were not any ! That's the only spoiler you are going to get in this review.",Knives Out

1899,arnrjn,Nicely made but a little thin for me,7,17 April 2020,"I thought the film was well made and the acting was good. However given that they expose the cause of the chase quite early in the film it leads you to believe that an obvious twist was coming in the end.
Its a good movie thats all for me.",Knives Out

The mystery isn't so spectacular as I thought, it looks entangled, but after the movie, I found it pretty easy.
But I think this movie is not about mystery in the general when I watched it, I didn't think about the whole case of murder, I listened to all the discussions and were mostly interested by them and acting, but it is my subjective opinion...",Knives Out

After watching this movie 4 times, I can STILL say that there is not a single moment where I'm just waiting for the next scene, hoping for the story to move on, or not entertained. Rian Johnson has managed to make every single second fascinating. Almost every character is memorable, and their interactions with each other are fantastic. Each time I rewatch this movie, I catch something new. Some hint to a reveal, a subtle detail referencing future events, or a great section of background dialog comes to light and just makes the movie more and more enjoyable. I cannot say enough good things about this.I have no complaints. This film is nothing short of perfection.",Knives Out

CASTThe movie holds a strong team of respected actors, however there was little to no chemistry between them at times which weakened some scenes in the movie.Also some characters had been overplayed by the cast at times.Despite his good performance Daniel Craig had difficulty holding to the Southern accent of Detective Blanc as his British accent would surface at time.STORYLINEThe mystery and twists weren't so kept tight together, as they were sort of predictable. And certain scenes were slightly dragged that either gave some clues away or felt boring.OVERALL Knives Out is an enjoyable movie specially with family.",Knives Out

1907,jessiesu-34124,Great but below expectation,7,15 December 2019,"Actually not as attractive as expected, lower than expectation due to the fact that they did not point out the body test and how he could leave nothing for the family.

The plot is brilliant, the writing is super. Cast is phenomenal, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans who work very good together on the screen. Rian Johnson does a tremendous operation: he take the genre of mystery novel, which is super classic and kinda old and turn it into something very fresh and prevailing. Highly recommend",Knives Out

1910,johnryeh-49694,fun time at the movies,9,29 November 2019,"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one.",Knives Out
1911,omidthegreat,An honest review of an awful film,1,2 December 2019,"I really wanted to like this film. I love whodunit films, from Agatha Christie to Murder She Wrote, the intrigue and mystery of this sub-genre can be very interesting and entertaining in the right hands. Yet here, with this film, none of the intrigue or mystery is either interesting nor entertaining, and like the awful humour, misses its mark! I like puzzles that hint at me, not hit me over the nose, and 'Knives Out' is a poor man's murder mystery - a very easy 1 out of 10.",Knives Out
1912,larryl-82383,GET THE TRUTH HERE,4,2 December 2019,"KNIVES OUT MOVIE - Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including brief violence, some strong language, sexual references, and drug materialWOW what a huge cast, Daniel Craig with a southern accent - ha what a stretch, that added comic relief throughout the film for me.
It opens with a policeman interviewing each sibling or family member of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who is now dead, was an interesting introduction to each character as they were questioned, but boring to me with the same chair and back and forth memories in audio and not visual! Its a twisted who-dunit murder mystery like an Agatha Christie, with a today's touch. The film has many of those Christie tropes of a detective warning us about foul play, marking everyone a suspect, and setting up all of the clues in plain sight. It all comes down to 60 million in cash, a publishing company and the mansion that everyone believe they deserve, or at ""least their cut"". The ""trump troll"" and ""some"" lines open your eyes and smile that this mystrigue is not set up in the past, but today. Yet the characters, screen set and back-drop are in no way, anyone I know of, and I've met many many people. The short political subtext thrust the audience into today, but also a narcissistic home and selfish family your glad you dont really know.
It has an all-star cast - I was happy to see some of the ""old"" stars back, Christopher Plumber - the Father, Don Johnson - who plays a son, Jamie Lee Curtis - daughter, Micheal Shannon, - is a son, ( that has a Trump loving son played by actor; Jaden Martell - and I found that to be a funny satire because the actor, Micheal Shannon is a big mouth progressive liberal). Toni Colette - daughter, Daniel Craig - the investigator, and Ana de Armas- the nurse care giver of the Father. ALL were funny and great in acting especially Ana de Armas who I dont really know but look forward to seeing her in another movie soon. All except, Toni Colette she was TERRIBLE, spewing lines as puke, over acting, she was worse than the 2 German Shepherds that were cast in the film. Every time she was in a scene she ruined it, deflated the energy and believability, constantly unprepared off tone and pace, I would not hire her to narrate a elementary school science film, BUT ENOUGH about her.
Each Character's history and perspective of what happened to the Father (murdered) because of their personal past and recent interaction with him, is Lived-out from the past memories initiated by the verbal back and forth questioning as Daniel Craig the southern Investigator keeps searching. All are waiting for the big ""surprise"" The WILL reading, that shocks the characters and family members, but not the audience. I almost fell asleep, and just smiled no laughs, good acting except Toni, (as I mentioned earlier) but the plot was not a surprise, so I give it a C. If its raining and you've got nothing else to do, wait till its on tv and boor yourself then.",Knives Out

Although in retrospect the end can be perceived as obvious, Johnson does such a great job leading the audience down different paths that even the obvious comes off as surprising.Daniel Craig's accent was a bit inconsistent, however that does not ruin the film at all.

The first part was cool until they somewhat revealed how it went down because a maid cannot tell lies. It was not at all exciting or mysterious. James Bond was cool but the other acting was C+ at best. People seem pretty salty at all the low ratings but the low ones are accurate.

There were no plot holes and the flow made the movie very enjoyable, which is great considering it's duration. Daniel Craig's southern drawl definitely caught me off guard and made me giggle several times throughout the viewing haha. Overall, it was an enjoyable, fun movie to watch that keeps you entertained and intrigued throughout. I did have higher expectations going into the film, and I have to say that the movie itself wasn't outstanding in any way.

And all without lots of violence or gore (one little exception noted). Great performances all around. Sure it's somewhere between Clue and Agatha Christie but who cares! It doesn't . It references Clue explicitly and Jessica Fletcher makes a cameo. Just enjoy! I haven't watched the last few Bond flicks, but I might the next just to see if Daniel Craig's and Ana de Armas's easy 'Knives Out' chemistry comes through in a completely different kind of movie.

The only downside really was that the kid didn't get that big a part, when he could've been quite useful, and also Daniel Craig's accent was a complete and utter joke, the worst part of the film.

But he took a level extra, and I could say that this is the best Mystery movie I've ever seen and possibly the best killer revelation at the climax by Benoit Blanc.The fact that he really gave Martha a physical condition; throwing up while lying, is just the best innovative creative decision ever.Nonetheless, all actors in it made it even more colourful and engaging.",Knives Out

1962,doncow,You May Know Who - But Do You Know How?,8,4 December 2019,"This was such fun. It was great watching Daniel Craig be his cleverist (is that a word -- then I make it up) best as Benoit Blanc. From the beginning when he clicked when someone told a lie to the end when he figured out the lay of things. I also got a kick out of Don Johnson in this movie. I've never seen him in a role were he appeared to be so vulnerable and he did it well. Jamie Lee plays the same character in so many movies, so it's hard to tell whether that's the real Jamie Lee or not. Toni Collette was terrific and I loved all the angles they shot her -- she would look either evil or coquettish in the same scene from different angels. K Callan was a kick. She could stare with the best of them. That might have been the easiest and most memorable part she's played in a while -- a true scene stealer. And needless to say, Everybody loves Christopher Plummer. Finally, one cannot leave out Ana de Armas as Marta. She did quite well, indeed, as a frightened maid who has great reason to be. And she looks a lot better as a brunette.One thing I thoroughly appreciated about this film is that you entered into politics, BUT you had both sides of the argument, not just the libs side of things. And I loved that Don has the last word on that. :) Made me happy I didn't have to leave the movie because I will if a movie is so biased.Thanks for good fun. I love a good mystery.",Knives Out

Then there's Daniel Craig doing a Hilarious Lionel Barrymore imitation as investigator Benoit Blanc. He leads an ensemble cast that includes Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Leigh Curits, Christopher Plummer, and Don Johnson, all ofwhom share a goofy approach to the material.
The only ewak spot of the filmis Chris Evans, who seems out of place as Ransom. I kept wanting to see James Franco, Evans just didn't register. Otherwise a good time.",Knives Out

You are in for a mystery with many twists, interesting and diverse characters brought to life by an all-star cast and witty dialog that enhances every scene.The murder mystery is done right, with so many unique characters that will keep you guessing. I recommend seeing this with someone, pick some remote spots so you can shush about some theories. You will get some things right but you will still be surprised by some twists.The movie introduces some serious aspects and themes in its dialogue but balances with witty and quirky one-liners that will make you smirk at the screen.Locations and cinematography are perfectly suited for this genre. You have a huge, old-school vintage mansion with a great wall full of knives that will pierce your attention from the first scenes.Conclusion: A well-balanced, entertaining mystery that stabs your attention and doesn't cut you off until the end!",Knives Out

The audience is taken on a literal twist of a plot where the conventional order we experience mysteries is flipped inside out in a way that is both deeply original and yet still pays homage to the classics that inspire it. A story blended with both comedy and suspense in a well-balanced cocktail of fun. If you'd like you could go deeper and also find some political undertones - but those were happily lost on me and the story was fun enough to be left well alone from the upper-class commentary.

But I gotta say, this film just falls short of my expectations. Maybe that's the problem, that I had high expectations going into it, but I'm just going to come out and say it: Rian Johnson thinks his film is more clever than it actually is.
The beginning was actually really good and definitely captured my attention - I was ready for the ride. But then after the ""reveal"" of how the murder was committed, I lost interest. If only Rian could've kept up the mystery longer and not make the mistake of trying to subvert the story for the sake of subversion (*cough* Game of Thrones *cough*), I would've given this a higher rating!
The ensemble cast was overall really good if not underused, with Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig both the stars of this movie, and the rest just playing their part. Overall, I don't get the hype. It was good for what it was but not great or fantastic as others have been lauding it as!",Knives Out

Benoit Blanc may fancy himself the next great detective of the murder mystery genre, but sadly he's more Arthur Hastings than Hercule Poirot.The solution to this mystery consists of twists you can both see coming and be surprised by, but my main issue with this movie is that not all characters are given equal focus and importance. The movie stars out by establishing that almost everyone had a motive for wanting Harlan dead and benefiting from his death, but somewhere along the way it drops this 'everyone is a suspect' mentality, to the slight detriment of the plot.",Knives Out

Who did what is something you learn pretty quickly, so when the big mystery is revealed in the end you go: wow! Thats lame and overly complicated. I also see no need for such a star studded cast. We dont see much from any of the characters at all. Talk about adding big actors for such boring and useless parts. Now on to the good: had the trailer not hyped me up for such a big mystery, then I think I would have loved it a whole lot more. Cuz all I felt while watching this movie was dissappointment.

1979,jordanucsd,"""My Coffee. My House. My Rules.""",8,14 February 2020,"""My Coffee. My House. My Rules.""It's so comforting to watch a film by a director that knows exactly what they want. Like a movie by Spielberg, Scorsese, Tarantino, and Fincher, Rian Johnson has his own distinctive style that adapts to different genres and is pretty effective every time. Like a well trained musician, Johnson knows how to play the notes, hit the beats, and please an audience. Yes, that includes The Last Jedi, which let's remind ourselves, was adored by many critics and audiences despite its reputation. To further the point, Knives Out makes it obvious that Johnson tries to please an audience by the way the movie challenges them, rather than comfort them with familiar tropes. In a sort of Shyamalanian, even Hitchockian, kind of way, Johnson has a need to surprise, an urgency to dissuade the audience from the ability to predict, and for that I am very grateful. When you don't really know where the story is going, you are all the more immersed in it.Knives Out does this in a spectacular fashion. It's so uncharacteristic of a murder-mystery to show the audience the murder itself only forty minutes into the film. Nevertheless, there is still a teasing mystery to be solved by the private detective Benoit Blanc played by Daniel Craig. By the way, who knew Craig can be this charismatic!? The film transforms into a Hitchcock thriller in the second act, with Johnson using every trick in the book to make Blanc's discovery of the culprit a nerve-racking experience akin to watching Dial M For Murder.What's most surprising to me is the film's comedic nature. This felt like a true comedy disguised as a murder-mystery, rather than a murder-mystery with some comedic bits in it. Every scene has jokes in it. Every single one. And they land in such a way that makes this one of the best theater going experiences an audience can have. I was fortunate enough to see this in a theater and the audible laughter proved it was a smart decision. Johnson is able to create quirky, layered, and engrossing characters and have them convincingly and hysterically play off each other. This is of course helped by an impressive star-studded cast. The actors are so tuned-in to not only who their character is, but how they should relate to the other characters. As amazing as Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Christopher Plummer, Toni Collette, Chris Evans and Daniel Craig are, the film belongs to Ana de Armas. The way she plays the character with such earnestness and truth is the heart of the story, the true extension of Harlan Thrombey who is displeased by the double-faced nature of his actual offspring. Kudos to Johnson and the casting director for a memorable ensemble.Straight off the undeserved backlash of The Last Jedi, Johnson has created another movie classic, and proves once again that he is truly a modern day filmmaking genius in his own right, and I look forward to the next Benoit Blanc tale he is going to spin in this movie's sequel. And perhaps, another Star Wars film? One can only hope. But another Johnson murder mystery will in the mean time fill the hole in the donut of anticipation.",Knives Out

That Southern ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" drawl was real music to the ears coming from this dyed in the wool English actor. Never have I seen a murder mystery that's so entertaining drawing so many chuckles. And kudos to the supporting cast - they did a fabulous job. And the climax?

I went to the movie last night to watch a golden globe norminee movie with low expectation due to Rian Johnsons last movie (Star Wars: The last Jedi). I was so happy that the movie didn't disappoint. It was just an amazing experiance.The cast in this movie was perfect. I loved Christopher Plummer role as a old, rich man (the head of the family). That role reminded me of ""All the money in the world"". Jamie Lee Curtis, Tony Collette, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson had minor roles but played them just fine. It was nice to watch Chris Evans playing another character than Captain America.The stars of the movie were Ana de Armes and Daniel Craig. Ana de Armes played the nurse to Christopher Plummers character ""Harlan Trombey"" and did a hell of a good job. She was so real and had alot of emotions. Ana de Armes definitely deserves a oscar norminee for actress in a supporting role. Daniel Craig aka James Bond played a detective who was hired to solved the murder mystery. I liked his character but didn't like his southern american accent. I like how he can play other roles than James Bond (i was a big fan of his role in Logan Lucky)To conclude this review: Ana de Armes did a really good job as did Daniel Craig. Rian Johnson wrote and directed a really good crime movie. This movie deserves some golden globes wins.",Knives Out

1986,jackiemirek,Not as great as it thinks it is.,5,6 September 2020,"While the fairly dense plot of this movie is certainly *clever*, fast paced, and structured in a way that never loses you and leaves the big bits for the end, it completely lacks all heart and soul. It's rather pleased with its smarmy, low brow rich d-bag characters and outting their rottenness with a maximum of irony and slappy wit. Start to absolute finish. Snore. What would have been unpredictable and satisfying by the end, is if someone in this garbage family did one right thing for one right reason, and it wasn't just the outsider who was decent. I'd be fine if she was the only ""winner"" at the end, I would just liked to have seen a glimmer of unpredictable humanity even in dark places. How clever and fresh can something be if trope characters fall to trope fates and motives? Give me a break.And also, just disregard the dumb reviews that see this as some ""woke"" angle. Biased minds make for biased viewing. I can say with absolute certainty that Knives OUt completely skewers liberal elitists and the rich right in exactly the same way. The fact that the nurse is a CHILD OF, NOT HERSELF an immigrant is absolutely immaterial. It was only necessary that she was not related to them, and of few means. Her mother's status or her own accent has nothing to do with her characterization and very little to do with the plot.This does not need to be politically biased to kind of suck.

And Rian just tried to copy it, but with the lack of talent and, let's face it, writing capacity.The plot is not for once complex. It's overcomplicated and the characters are not interesting. Not a bit. They're one-dimensional and cliché and they reflect some of Rian's traumas. The kid that it's an internet alt right troll it's his way to show how ""dull"" and ""lame"" those people are, exhibiting his worst side as a sad person.The puke plot devide it's, besides disgusting, stupid.

2005,awesomolocity,"""A case with a hole in the middle""",10,24 November 2019,"I got a chance to watch Knives Out at an early screening this week. And I am so glad I was able to go, because it was one of the best movies I've seen this year. (And that's without my bias towards coming-of-age stories)Rian Johnson writes and directs this movie, and it's such a great job from him all around. You can tell this was written the way good mysteries are supposed to be written - backwards. There are so many good twists and turns that reference things happening earlier in the movie. It's the type of mystery that the viewer can solve, if you're paying attention. And on top of that, it manages to be absolutely hilarious the entire time. The humor is witty. The mystery is a modern take on a old genre. It breaks a few tropes to find it's own path. And it's just an amazing journey.If I start listing actors and actresses who give good performances, you'll just wind up seeing the entire cast list. Seriously, the cast includes Daniel Craig, Katherine Langford, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Christopher Plummer, and others. And every performance is top notch. Nothing feels out of character. Every character has distinct traits. Every actor and actress understands their character and works towards that.

It really leans into it toward the beginning of the third act without realizing it.Final Thoughts: Though well-worth seeing and great fun, this'll be a better watch the second time around. Without giving anything away, there're a handful of small details in this movie that observant viewers will find impossible to let go of. You'll know what I mean immediately when you watch for yourself. You keep asking yourself how they'll factor into the climax/resolution, but quite a few of them just don't come back into play (See Next Paragraph). Very frustrating, but, as I said in the title, this'll be much less of a problem once you know what does and doesn't matter to the inevitable ""whodunnit""-style reveal (AKA your second time watching).
I'll mention one of those ""red herring"" small details at the end of this paragraph that talked about earlier. By definition, this ISNT a spoiler because it's quite literally irrelevant to the plot, but if you truly do want to go into the film totally blind, now's your chance to turn away.......No? Still here? Cool, so one of the biggest distractors in the movie (for me, at least) is undoubtedly the baseball. No relevance to plot at all, but they kept placing it front-and-center.

I thought, ""no, it can't possibly be him, that's too obvious. There must be someone else."" There wasn't.-Obviously someone tampered with the drugs. Saw that from miles away.-Though the family was ""eccentric,"" overall not interesting. Very unlikable.

I'll give them that one, though. I think that was intentional.-No surprises AT ALL, everything was expected, and key plot points were, again, revealed much too soon.-Nothing unique.-Daniel Craig's character didn't fit; it was supposed to be a dark comedy, yes, but still a drama. His performance was totally over the top and ridiculous. Even his name. His character seemed fit for a parody of a murder mystery, which this film clearly wasn't. It was obviously trying to be a funny, yet super clever, masterpiece of mystery. It wasn't.-That leads to another problem: this film seemed a bit confused on what it wanted to be, and where it wanted to go.-The house and the old man were such wasted opportunities. So much potential for a twist. There weren't any.-The window? Was that the twist?? Really???-Was the prop knife really supposed to be the juicy curveball we were all waiting for?

Whoever wrote that should feel silly.-The acting was so/so. I didn't find anyone particularly phenomenal. Good, sure, but forgettable. And some characters had barely any lines, and offered nothing to the plot. Why even have them there? They were more like set-dressing.-If not obvious, overall very, very, underwhelming.-The 4 stars is because it was mildly entertaining at times; when it wasn't being dragged out like a strip of stale gum.",Knives Out
2012,radnusrajan,Christie mixed with Hitchcock rummy cocktail!,9,29 January 2020,"What a movie! No superheroes, no computer graphics, no violence, nothing broken except a trellis of a false window! Just about, say, 50ml of blood spilt. Nobody was out to destroy the worlds or universe and no one in capes with their underwear worn outside to save the planets. Lovely music. Lovely environs of a huge old house filled with scene stealing bric-a-bracs. Superb actors in an ensemble cast all of who were made to do exactly what the director wanted and they did it superbly. A whodunit movie from the good old times when they used to tell a good story that made sure that your finger never went near the pause button. An intoxicating combination of Christie and Hitchcock. A lovely heroine, without makeup or skilfully underdone one, who is a murder suspect. A rich old man found with his throat cut and many of his family members have the motive to do him in. A suicide by cutting one's own throat - a first for me in a crime movie. Suicde? Accident? Murder? The story moves as fast and smoothly as a Federer backhand.
But it has as many twists as Nadal's topspin forehand, with a nasty bounce. Dialogues are sharp and to the point as in the old noir

Everything picture perfect and I won't ask pardon for the pun. The only jarring note for me was the accent of the private detective Blanc. Perhaps it was done to ward off the evil eye, a dristi pottu as we say in Tamil. All in all a movie which will not

A good script that praises the beauty of a kind heart, with continuous knots from the beginning to the end, with the dream cast from classic movies like The Sound of Music, James Bond , Captain America, True Lies...A good detective is not only interested in finding the truth but also knows what to do with it.The image of the coffee cup with the words ""..."" appearing at the beginning & the end of the film is exquisite.Anyone who likes detective movies should check it out to play the guessing game who did what before the secret is revealed.",Knives Out
2017,superdaan,The best whodunnit it a loooooong while,9,28 November 2019,"This movie is great for multiple reasons but I'll stick to my main two.Reason 1: every character is memorable. They all had something that made them ""them"" you feel me. Even the young kid who barely has any lines is funny. Chris Evans and Daniel Craig are stand out roles. Chris Evans finally gets to play an diff instead of the always righteous patriot and Daniel Craig is just the best detective I've seen in one of these movies. You have your guys like the poirot from the recent adaptation of ""the murder on the orient express"", those aren't fun detectives. They're shallow characters written in the early 1900 that haven't evolved with time. Daniel Craig in this movie however is a very funny, likeable but also smart detective.
These characters feel real. They're not some pawns in a game of cluedo they're actual personalities. There characters aren't based on their occupation but on how eccentric they're. It's not ""the cook"", ""the Maid"" and ""the doctor"" but its ""Marta"", ""ransom"" and ""Harlan"". (Harlan btw, great victim. He's such a nice guy and I hate it when shows and tv make the victim of crimes a bad guy because the audience wouldn't feel bad for that characters death. That's stupid, that would make a villain an anti hero. This movie makes him instantly likeable by showing his interaction with Marta)Reason 2: Good story. Knives out whodunnit aspect is perfectly executed. It keeps you guessing on who ""dunnit"" (get it) and every time you think you know you get thrown for a loop. While watching I came up with atleast 4 different theories just for them to turn out wrong at the end. It's so good",Knives Out

2019,chrisatack-64628,Takes genius to be so bad,1,5 January 2021,"Hard to imagine why this total clunker is rated higher than 3 max.This is a movie that could have been great. It had so much going for it -- good cast, good production values, tried-and-true genre -- all spoiled by the really awful writing. This movie is lame, right out of the gate. We have a ""famous PI"" (Daniel Craig) who pretty much takes over the investigation -- which apparently really isn't an investigation or something -- right from the start. Now, in murder mysteries and in real life the police usually object to a PI getting involved. Not here -- the PI is apparently so famous that the police are OK with him taking over. Why is he so famous that the police defer to him? Well, that is never really explained, that's just how it is apparently. Yeah, Okay...And it goes downhill from there. We have a nurse who throws up every time she lies (really?) and doesn't read the labels on drugs before injecting them (REALLY?) and thereby accidentally kills her only patient, a rich old man, who fortunately doesn't mind dying, and actually spends his last moments on earth trying to cover up her little boo-boo because..uh..she's a good person or something.So then, we have an apparent suicide under suspicious circumstances, but no autopsy, which would immediately show the deceased had a massive morphine overdose on board. And on and on, one implausible plot turn after the next. The characters are wooden, the p0lot is ridiculous., every so often there is a slice of politically correct commentary, presumably to show us how socially aware the director is.This isn't a spoof, it isn't a murder mystery, it isn't a comedy -- it's just a half-baked mess with a great cast that is sadly wasted on an almost unbelievably poor script.",Knives Out
2020,worldeater,These ingredients dont make a broth,2,4 February 2020,"The writing is bad. The acting is uncomfortably unconvincing and self conscious.Apparently boomers love this movie because it reminds them of that old, horrible style of who-done-it where a clever investigator makes impossible connections without the film letting the audience in on any of the nuances of discovery.Novels like these were written as fast as people could type a hundred years ago because they were so simple, formula, and decidedly un-clever to generate.Now, if this style appeals to you, I would still issue a word of caution.This film clearly intended to assemble an ensemble cast that would bring life to its quirks and quips. The script seems to be intended to allow the cast to shine through what the author thought were interesting and audacious characters.However, both the writing and acting come off very flat and even painful. The film that the creators intended is obvious, and clearly present throughout as a sad, unimaginative passenger repeatedly embarrassed by trite dialog and the unrealized aspirations of a mediocre cast.This is a very bad film.",Knives Out

2027,akskshay,A Murder Mystery with perfect dose of humour.,7,10 May 2020,"Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy writer, is turning 85. His eclectic and eccentric family has become fragmented, but Harlan believes he can reunite them at his birthday. After the entire family gathers at his mansion to celebrate him, he is found dead the very next morning. When the police begin to investigate his death along with private investigator Benoit Blanc, (Daniel Craig), many family secrets come to light. There are now multiple murder suspects, and they must figure who is responsible for Harlan's death.
Inspired by the plethora of Agatha Christie novels, writer and director Rian Johnson knows how to stage a murder mystery. Put an affluent old man at loggerheads with his family. Make each member intriguing, and give them reasonable cause - revenge, greed, spite, or all the above. Throw in a peculiar detective to solve the case, and watch the mayhem unfold.
But Johnson isn't content with the plot playing out in predictable ways. Instead, his characters are so mesmerising that you often get sidetracked, by design. After all, these aren't just big-name actors; they're all competent performers. Daniel Craig completely throws you off with a thick and heavy Southern accent that could quickly go over the top. But Craig knows how to reel it in, in a masterful performance. We're used to seeing Chris Evans play a heroic persona, but this time he's often despicable as Ransom Robinson. The underrated Toni Collette gives a unique take on Joni Thrombey, Harlan's daughter-in-law. The resurgence of Jamie Lee Curtis's career continues as Linda, Harlan's eldest daughter. However, 'Knives Out' is probably going to be the breakthrough film for Ana de Armas with her impressive performance.
As with most ensemble casts, some actors don't get as much screen time as they should, and the problem persists here. Nevertheless, it's safe to say they all do their roles ample justice. That's because the writing is outstanding, infused with a surprising amount of unexpected humour. While watching a murder mystery, everyone is trying to solve the case, but Rian Johnson will catch most of the audience off guard. He has created an extremely thrilling crime drama, that uses the collective skills of its excellent cast to great effect. 'Knives Out' makes a strong case as one of the best films of the year and a definitive murder mystery for the ages.",Knives Out

2029,Zelenogorsk,Good but...,6,29 January 2020,"Very good whodunnit but it's a one time watch, a highly enjoyable watch nonetheless. However, does every damn American movie has to say something about Trump. Make no mistake this is a straight-up mystery film but it has an overarching theme, which is a little irritating. I guess directors feel like they need to be on the right side of politics to be engaging. This reminds me of one of the critics' review of 'Dragged Across Concrete', in which he called it a right-wing propaganda. I guess other films could be called left-wing propaganda? Maybe just maybe, film-makers should focus on films, rather than social commentary, especially when it's not particularly profound and are based on over-all ""feelings"" among the artistic types and the enlightened. That being said, if you also notice this trend, don't let it stop you from watching this. As stated before - a very witty and escapist whodunnit!",Knives Out

Putting aside that this is weird and personally i did not care for such a start, it is also a lie. That is not to say that the movie had not twists. Still with a beginning like that I had higher expectations.
As far as the plot goes, the story begins with the death of a rich writer. The leading actress feeling responsible for his death, tries to hide the fact that she is involved from the investigation that takes place about the circumstances of his death. This pretty much sums up the movie.

2034,Zyroshi,Surprisingly good,8,27 September 2021,"I watched it thinking I would get a mediocre movie, but I actually got much more than I would have ever thought. I have seen there are plenty of critical reviews that say the plot was too weak, I guess it depends on how much mystery media you have consumed over the years. But in my case I have consumed plenty and I still found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.That being said this movie is not for everyone, the characters, scenario and even the plot itself are really exaggerated, sometimes even touching the edge of absurdity, this is not by any means a bad thing in my book, but I can understand why some people would find it unpleasant or unnecessary.Overall I think the characters were very well done and portraited, the plot, although somewhat simple, was interesting and enjoyable, the art department did a fantastic job, and in the rest of categories it was more than decent.

The music was pretty standard for the ""who done it?"" type of film. The sound effects were astonishing and kept me on the edge.

2044,SSFilms269,"One of my favorite films, ever",10,6 January 2021,"As an avid Star Wars fan, I have an underlying dislike for Rian's work, this film completely changed my mind on him. What a film this is, I'm usually good at foreseeing plot twists, but this one I did not. Ana played Marta brilliantly, the character being so innocent makes the later events of the film all the more confounding. Chris Evans plays his arrogant role very well, it was weird seeing him without spandex for once. Craig puts on a very American accent, which was very off-putting for me, but I got used to it by the midpoint of the film, the accent fits the character really well, and it adds a-lot of dramatic effect in the 'reveal' scene. The film just gets better after a re-watch, as everything you discover the first time round creates a sort of game while spotting all the brilliantly executed hints. As I don't want to spoil this film for anyone who hasn't watched it yet, I have tried my best to not mention anything about the plot as if anyone were to have spoilt this film for me, I would have missed out on a truly incredible film.

Liked a lot -
Characters were eclectic, although not too original, but were very entertaining. Daniel Craig's character, as a hired PI, was my favorite. His Southern accent caught me off guard at first. I'm guessing him and Chris Evens took these roles to get past their James Bond and Captain America characters. A nice departure for both.
Very strong acting all the way around, however the lead female actor, Ana de Armas stole the show. She had some great emotional close ups that were very captivating. This is the first movie I noticed her in but I will look for her now in others.
The pace of the file was strong from beginning to end. One of the few films over the last year that I lost track of time and was fully immersed in.
Good for all ages, which was nice since I had a 12 year old with me. All of the family enjoyed the film.So so -
The whodunit kept me engaged until the end, but the plot did have some holes. I was OK with them since they didn't play a big role in the overall story line. Also, the move was moving fast, so I soon forgot about them.Dislike -
One of the main reasons I couldn't give this 10 stars (besides the plot holes) is that the movie had the charters talk about present day politics at the dinner table. I'm very liberal and the message that was being supported was liberal as well, but I go to (comedy) movies to get away from politics. It wasn't needed and was a turn off for me. I thought the movie did the same thing, but in a much better and subtle way, when all of the family claimed that the Latino nurse (the main caregiver of the murdered father, played by Ana de Armas) was part of their family, but couldn't remember where the nurse's family was from (a running joke through out the film as the characters told what happened from their point of view). Or how the family didn't want the nurse to be at the funeral, but everyone claimed to the nurse's face that they voted that she should be allowed to attend (another running joke). I thought these more subtle ways did a great job showing how the family felt about ""the help"", making the more direct approach at the dinner table feel preachy (didn't fit the mood of the quirky comedy). The same is true about one of the characters (the grandson of the murdered grandfather). I won't go into details, but you will get my point when you see the movie. That ways over the top and not needed either.",Knives Out

2070,joshuavela-58606,When a family doesn't get what they want... the knives are unsheathed,9,28 November 2019,"Writer/director Rian Johnson has taken a classic whodunnit mystery and revamped the genre into a romp full of comedy and charisma, but remains loyal to the puzzle-solving demands of the genre. We can imagine Agatha Christie giving a thumbs up from her grave.When the patriarch of the Thrombey family, mystery writer Harlan Thrombey, is found dead from apparent suicide, the family comes together in hopes of inheriting the writer's riches, while, at the same time, an investigation into the suicide is being performed.From the very start we see the brilliance of the film as the camera speeds through different areas of the Thrombey mansion, highlighting Harlan's written works and collected antiques. We get to know the writer with these subtle depictions, and we infer that we are about to meet a snobby family. Although 'snobby' is an underlying subtext, the family we meet is full of eccentricity and quirkiness. Each member of the family provides something new for the palette. It's like sitting at the dinner table and enjoying a twelve course meal. And there's plenty of dessert with Daniel Craig playing the lead private investigator with the flamboyant southern accent, the mismatched pair of detectives, and the home nurse Marta, played by Ana de Armas.One area where the film detours from conventional storytelling is in showing us how the death happened at an early stage. We are then invited to figure out what is the relevance of everything else happening in the story. What emerges from this is a very satisfying unfolding of events that does not leave us feeling cheated. But beneath everything, we see issues that afflict most families and their particular members. There are the haughty ones that boast in the glory of seemingly raising a family to a higher social status. There are those that remain in a family simply to leech benefits. Then there are those that are not satisfied with what they've been given, and feel they are deserving of more. These issues produce a field of combatants that disrespect the blood that binds them, and the Thrombey family is a clear example of that: when they don't get what they want...the knives come out.In my opinion this is one of the year's better films with a stellar cast and a solid script. The younger audience will probably be bored (as were the rambunctious teenagers sitting in the same aisle as us), but for us older folks we'll be entertained and probably reminded of certain individuals that make up our family!Overall grade: A",Knives Out
2071,Gladiatrix14,I knew who did it going in. And I was STILL entertained.,10,29 November 2019,"Let me just say that given all the press around this movie and cast interviews, etc...I had a pretty good idea of who killed Harlan. But the way it all played out was not only very clever but very entertaining as well. I thought Michael Shannon was a bit underutilized here as I happen to love him, but otherwise no complaints. Ana de Armas truly is the heart and soul of the movie and you definitely root for her throughout. As for Chris Evans...well, he was phenomenal. I actually prefer his non-Marvel work (Gifted, Street Kings and Puncture are some of my faves) and this one really shows off his acting chops in a huge way. I'm waiting for him to get the respect he deserves as an actor not just for playing a superhero but for bringing a depth and believability to his roles that is very unique. In short, see this movie NOW. I'm going to see it at least one more time in theatres to try and see if I can spot any clues throughout that I may have missed the first time.",Knives Out
2072,damienkirby-00779,"Enjoyable, and just a little ridiculous",8,2 December 2019,"As someone who grew up watching all manner of Agatha Christie shows, and other mystery series of a similar type, I very much enjoyed my time at Knives Out.It sticks pretty close to the usual formula for shows of that type, and executes it well, with good performances from the whole main cast, and enough twists, turns and intrigue to keep one's attention throughout. It doesn't disappoint once the threads start to come together to fill the hole left in the middle of the story since the beginning.Daniel Craig's accent sounds like a caricature of a Kentuckian, and a comparison to that of Foghorn Leghorn wouldn't hit far from home, but I found it to be fun and pleasant, rather than irritating, as some attempts at regional accents can end up being.Most of the main circle of characters are modern American tropes (the young female college student, the teenage neo-nazi who spends his time on 4Chan or some similar ""social platform"", the middle aged woman who owns a business that sells cleansing skincare products and promotes a lifestyle of clean, natural living, the middle aged man who regurgitates right-wing talking points), and can be quite one-dimensional, but the core characters are unique enough that you don't feel that the whole cast are simply playing characters extracted via cookie cutter.Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good Columbo mystery, or has spent some time enjoying the incredibly high murder rates in Midsomer.",Knives Out
2073,ialssaka,Nice take on murder mystery!,8,5 December 2019,"Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage.",Knives Out
2074,bionihockey,An exciting who done it!,7,5 December 2019,"'Knives Out' was written and directed by Ryan Johnson, the man behind films like 'Looper' and 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. I have my problems with The Last Jedi, but I can't rate a film based on a directors earlier film.Let me start with what I didn't like. This isn't your normal run of the mill who done it. The first act you learn something very vital to the plot and from there you don't feel much tension until the third act. With that in mind, my friends and I were still glued to the screen trying to piece together everything that was going on. It in the end was a bit predictable, but this didn't ruin the experience for me. The other thing I really didn't care for was Johnson's use of politics. Now I'm not a very political person, but he uses this to make some characters look ""evil"". I didn't see it when I first watched the film. I was very surprised he even added it in the script, but after thinking about it, he used it as a tool to make characters look more sinister. It's understandable why, but you can write characters to be hated without being political. I even laughed at one of the jokes that was said during this scene until I realized he was actually making a jab at people who think that way. But again, I'm reviewing the film - not people's political views.Now what I liked. The acting was phenomenal across the board. Everyone was a stand out to me except for actor Jaeden Martell (Lieberher). He was previously known for his role as Bill in 2017s 'IT'. He does the best he can with what he is given but he really isn't in the movie, his character just sits around on his phone like me writing this review. I wish I could commend every performance in the film but we would be here all day. My two stand outs would be Chris Evans and Toni Collette. There was also a fun cameo by Frank Oz which was great. This film also has a great fresh style and direction. The way he opens the film really made me cheese. The way he wrote the film was also great. The little clues he gives you throughout were very clever and it kept me on the edge of my seat, literally. The film was also very funny; I was very surprised on how much comedy was in it.Ryan Johnson's 'Knives Out' was a great film with fantastic acting! The story was engaging with a satisfying ending! It was a great time at the movies and I recommend checking this one out. It's no masterpiece, but this gets me excited for what new and engaging stories Johnson has up his sleeves - just stay away from 'Star Wars'.Final verdict: 7.5 / 10That's my 2 cents!Alex Bioni",Knives Out

Anyone keen on viewing this film to figure out the big ""mystery"" will pay attention to everything, subtle or blatant. If you do you will be rewarded with the obvious. As obvious as it may be it is still enough make you feel good for following along as close as you did. Even if that is not your cup-o-tea its a wild ride the entire way and well worth it.

2083,NikFlick,Aesthetics and plot 11/10,9,30 March 2020,"So a quick summary (as a long essay about the film follows), this film is beautiful. From the aesthetic pleasure it provides with its cinematography to the plot. I can only think of one part where it kind of lacks which is firstly the famous blood stain and secondly no performance is Oscar-level. It is a must watch for me.Plot: ExcellentWhile it starts using a really cliché idea it does not follow the traditional path and quite frankly, everything is really unexpected. The characters are also really well built which solidifies the base of the screenplay making it sort of bulletproof to logical blunders. Lastly, the story is compelling as it had me hooked from start to finish.Direction & Cinematography: ExcellentI originally had them split up, but thus I wasn't giving enough credit to the director. Anyways, the way it was directed served the story justice by complementing its strengths and covering its minimal flaws. One of them is the fact that there is a lot of explaining done. To keep the audience engaged you have parts of the narration depicted as if you're inside the narrator's head. Moving more to the cinematography side, the aesthetics are superb. Almost everything takes place inside of a house. The selection of which is astonishing. Its exterior serves the story flawlessly but the real deal is its interior. Firstly its so beautiful I could just watch shots of it and be entertained, but nonetheless it really compliments the story's complexity. To be honest I knew I would enjoy the aesthetics of the film just by the first scene with the dogs running across a misty landscape with a beautiful mansion in the background.Performances: DecentAt first I was sort of reluctant on how Daniel Craig and Chris Evans would perform as their roles were really far from what I -at least- am used to seeing from them. First things first, Craig was astonishing all along just giving you the vibe of the deep down really smart detective who comes across kind of silly. Chris Evans on the other hand was simply ok. He seemed a little bit off but nothing that busted the film. But, I was really surprised by Jamie Lee Curtis, she had a really good performance (possibly the best out of the entire crew) and by Ana de Armas. To finish it off even the secondary actors did an amazing job of complimenting that feeling of uneasiness that was all over the house.",Knives Out

The first thirty minutes play out similarly to a normal murder mystery. The murder is found and all of the suspects are introduced. Then when a character that I will not say the name of here is interviewed by Blanc. The movie shifts genres; what was once a traditional whodunit is now a crime movie.

As of today, a good mystery film has become a lost pearl, this film is definitely a gem with some ingenuity. The resolution is predictable, but still wrapping in a good sense of wit. But besides of some cheesy tricks, like ""you"" & ""hugh"", I also found that the film lacks the character's development, as most characters (Jamie Lee Curtis, e.g.) are fell to the background the whole time (which is opposite the fundamental theory of Whodunnit) except Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. Even Daniel Craig appears subdued and monochromatic. But nevertheless, it's still entertaining, especially for Ana's can't-miss performance, so I strongly recommend it.",Knives Out

Review of Knives Out - June 15, 2020 - by Vince LondiniRian Johnson's murder mystery brings a modern sensibility and wit. Not afraid of self-deprecation, whether the house (""like a clue board""), the detective (""you're not much of a detective""), or the car chase (""that...was the dumbest car chase of all time""), Johnson mostly keeps it light with characters who are largely aware of their limitations.Johnson proves a master at misdirection. The evidence of which becomes clearer after you've seen it through.A number of famous names take fun turns here, including Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson. But the key casting decisions gambled on whether Daniel Craig and Chris Evans could escape the shadow of their genre-defining roles.Craig slips into the skin of an eccentric, self-effacing, shambling detective - Peter Falk would be proud - and pretty-much pulls it off. No license to kill, here.Evans' turn is a bit tougher. Without a contrived accent to work with, he still sounds like Steve Rogers even as Ransom Drysdale tells-off each of his relatives, one by one. In posture and demeanor he sells the spoiled scion. We are almost freed from the blinding glint off of Cap's vibranium shield. A scene establishing Ransom's scoundrel-ness might have helped. So, I find Evans less convincing - but entertaining nonetheless.As for the mystery? Suffice it to say you'll spend the whole movie second-guessing whether you can trust what you've seen. Then you'll find out the real rules at the end...and that's when you'll want to watch it again. 9/10.",Knives Out

LOL. That said, I was disappointed that there wasn't a little more humor. Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson have decent comedic timing that largely went untapped.

First of all knives out is a good movie with a few weaknesses but i will talk about them later. So lets start with the things i like in this movie. The characters are very well writen and very diffrent. The costum design is really good in my opinon because every character has his own dress code wich makes the characters visual diffrent. The editing is also very well done and underlines the important things on the screen without being to quick when jumping from one shot to another. The story has a few weaknesses but is very solid and picks up a lot of speed at the end. Another positive thing about this movies are the actors because they all played their characters very well.The story is (after watching it a second time) amazing there are so many little hints in the plot that i only realised after watching it twice.the only negative thing i can is that the story may lacks some speed at the end.in summary good murder mystery movie with a little weaknesses but with good characters acting,editing and set design.",Knives Out

2127,stoverashlee,Another Agatha Christie,8,14 August 2020,"I watched this movie twice, the first time in theaters and wasn't expecting much but was blown away. It's another Agatha Christie-like modernized short story, and I don't care for much of her work but still thuroughly enjoyed it. The movie felt kinda long but I was still sitting on the edge of my seat for quite a bit of it. There are some parts that are predictable if you have a stronger sense of intuition, though it does not take the fun out of things. The second time I watched it with friends and I ended up explaining some of the minor twists in the plot to them because it's easy to miss details. This movie has wonderful color and cinematography that won't be forgotten with time. Each frame has been carefully thought out and is consistent in showing how much thought and effort the production team cared and worked for this film. It's something that will frequently be discussed and selected off the shelf or browsing menu for years to come.",Knives Out
2128,padraigmurphy-81123,"Lacks suspense, boring premise and poor twist",4,13 August 2020,"Surprised at level of reviews here. A very strong cast and production values are the highlights. However, the plot is at the level of ""Murder she wrote"", the suspense level does not even approach Scooby Doo, and the murder reveal is as anti-climactic as an episode of Columbo (where after all the killer is known from the start). But all of these have a structure that grabs you, and keeps you intrigued. The sleuth played by Daniel Craig is a cross between Sherlock Holmes, Columbo and Col. Saunders. The side kick cops are cardboard cutouts. Many of the most interesting characters (ie older and better actors) became redundant early on. Like a tired game of Cluedo, I lost interest half way through and I was checking how much was left towards the end.",Knives Out

The cast and production suggest this should be quality but after a strong start, the story falls flat. Standouts: Daniel Craig's terrible southern accent, an utterly stupid vomit based plot device for poor Ana de Armas, a make up artist who needed to be fired for caking every cast member over the age of 35 in an inch of foundation and an overly contrived finale which isn't really much of a surprise.",Knives Out

The tone, the scenery, the editing style, the one vs all rules, rule the consistency of brown, yellow and orange/teal tones in every scene, amazing. My problem is with Ransom. His character throughout the movie, while acting like a badass, seemed to chill. If he knew about all of this, how could he hide it this much, and also not even try anything, due to the fact he knows it's his family's money, and barely try's anything to get it back. Now I know, your gonna say, ""but it's for character development, he needs to befriend her before he can try anything!"" While those are fair points, I say to you this, what would you do in that situation? Your family's fortune has been placed in possession of some, and you need to get it back. What do you do? Wait it out and trick her into giving the money back? Or just take it and bring it back to your family? Think on that, and then rewatch the movie.",Knives Out

It also has a great ensemble cast with good performances all round especially Daniel Craig's with his over the top acting to poke fun at the genre. It also had a few comedic moments which did make me laugh and i was enjoying the movie.However, then the third act occurred. The twist was predictable and it lacked pay off due to a lack of tension from when the things started happening to Marta as the person knew about the part she played in the grandfathers death as it seemed to happen so quickly. Then when the detective found out what she did, he already knew and didn't seem to care at all, completely killing any of the lack of tension or purpose in Marta trying so hard not to get caught, as there seemed to be no consequence whatsoever.Overall, this movie to me was just, ok, and i was very excited to watch this movie due to the hype around it but ultimately just felt disappointed as it didn't seem to warrant this.",Knives Out

2147,tonymalocca,Like an episode of Murder She Wrote with added 'comedy'.,4,11 January 2020,"This big-name cast overacts its way through this lame excuse for a whodunit. You would think that this writer/director would have learned his lesson after The Last Jedi, but the identity politics are here, front and centre.
The plot itself is not that great. The whole purpose of this genre is to keep the audience guessing until the denouement, but even half asleep I had figured out who the baddie was and had more or less unraveled the plot. Johnson is no David Mamet.
This picture tries to capture the smartness of an Agatha Christie novel or play like The Mousetrap or The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, with the upper crust players, the old house, a will reading and the cliched characters. Each of the suspects is from the imagination of someone obsessed with the 'basket of deplorables'. Every one of them has a flaw that makes them impossible to like, all are bigoted and avaricious when pushed out of their comfort zones. The main character, on the other hand, is so pretty and pure and perfect and kind. She's one big liberal stereotype, which is ironic, considering that the actress almost turned down the role because she felt it was too stereotypical.
Daniel Craig just plods through the picture with a pretty poor southern drawl.
I hope the film gods put an end to Rian Johnson's career sooner rather than later. How many disasters does it take before they wake up?

Great acting, excellent photography and very interesting plot and characters. I just felt that the reveal was, maybe, too fast. The ""reveal"" of how the event actually took place was too early for me, eventhough I knew there was more to the story. Which was revealed at the end, VERY quickly (for me and my friends at least) in a way that you don't have time to put the pieces together yourself, or even go back in memory to check that everything said is correct and void of loopholes. Especially that the way everything happened had SO many interrelated elements where the chronological of each event is crucial to the story. It is very easy to get lost.I think this deserves a second viewing, but I'll wait for the blu-ray.

Take mental notes throughout the movie. After you leave the cinema with a smile, having been truly entertained, take some time to pick the movie apart.

2157,lothary,Boring naive fairytale,3,21 April 2020,"We fell asleep the first three times attempting to watch this film. On high recommendation from respected theater friends, we finally suffered past the first sleepy 45 minutes and spent the remainder of the movie flummoxed at what kind of viewer could ever swallow the premise of this murder and the holes in the plot too numerous and too much of a spoiler to mention. Set in modern time, the viewer must somehow forget the way any modern murder investigation is conducted through evidence forensics, DNA, personnel, and crime labs. Plot hole is stacked atop plot hole and preposterous coincidence that makes for an impossible suspension of disbelief. Apart from the inane writing for only the most gullible, not a single character had anything resembling likeability. We didn't really care about a single character, regardless of the star studded cast. I found myself waiting for some spectacular and grabbing dialogue or interaction, but only found disappointment, similar to a Fourth of July fireworks volley of duds that go straight to the ground without an Ooo! or an Aaah! By the time the predictable plot twisting and lengthy, rambling and unbelievable whodunit monologue of the lead ""investigator"" (a private detective somehow given sole authority!) arrived, we could have cared less about the plot, the characters, the victim, the family, the bumbling investigators, the good natured nurse, or even the overly pretentious artsy scenery or filming. The most interesting person in this charade was the mute Great Grandmother! Clearly this was 2 hours we should have continued napping through.

It looked mediocre and stayed that way. It's too bad, since we don't get too many old-fashioned mysteries on the big screen.Knives Out isn't garbage. I gave it an extra star for the decent cast, another for the nice scenery, and one more for the reference to 'Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?'. The film borrows chunks of Hercule Poirot's Christmas. Marta, who resembles Pilar in many ways, takes that character's ethic, albeit ""dumbed down "" in the modern style. While Pilar and that family grew during the course of the story, these folks just become more unlikable as time passes.Not to defend the a-hole family, but the will at the center of this mess would be shot down in probate. A person, believing she has accidentally poisoned her employer and benefactor, spends the entire film covering it up, and the victim cuts his own throat to help her. That is either undue influence or evidence of mental incapacity, depending on how much of her story is believed. Fear not, Marta was the personal nurse of an doting multi-millionaire, long enough to be considered family. She's probably a millionaire herself by this time.I hate to have to mention it, but people need to get a grip on the politics. If anything, this was some sort of apology from the director. The target group was a rich Massachusetts family, and the writers were calling them hypocrites throughout.Anyway, maybe I'll have better luck with 1917.",Knives Out

The acting, costumes and scenery was spot on but the plot was way too predictable for a whodunit. From the moment Chris Evans began with his lines there was no more guessing, and the roles of the family members didn't hold up because literally nobody was seen as a suspect in my eyes. From the moment Ransom asked Marta if she had checked her mails, the gig was up and this was not even remotly close towards the finale so in my eyes a lost chance. Non the less, very enjoyable movie and time flew while watching. Daniel Craig was candy to my eyes with his accent, the chemistry between him and Ana de Armas was holding strong, maybe due the fact that they are playing together in Bond 25, so that's a plus.

And this one's an alt-right troll! This one likes Trump, even though we're not explicitly using his name! Isn't this politically salient and timely?!) Especially since that stuff never actually figures into the plot in any way and it amounts to just an onslaught of familiar sociocultural references we can all back-pat ourselves for recognizing. ""Clue for the modern era"" sounds great on paper, but I feel like it could've been done with a tad more panache than this.Still pretty good, though! Craig doing Rust Cohle-by-way-of-Foghorn Leghorn was easily the highlight for me-though Chris Evans has a few all-timer line deliveries and can rock a wool sweater like nobody's business. M.

So much for complexity of characters (which is usually the backbone of a good mystery!)

Rian Johnson accomplishes to mix the suspense of the murder mystery, a great comedy with an excelent cast. Daniel Craig's performance is so close and yet so far from James Bond.

It's enjoyable, but it never fully commits to the high camp it aspires to. It reminded me of a Wes Anderson film if you removed all the style, brains and humour.

2215,justin323032-170-663216,Politics ruined this film,5,1 January 2020,"As many other have stated, the politics were totally unnecessary and ruined the arc of the film. Spoilers ahead.
 I thought it was going to be clever for Marta to have been the killer all along, and the black sheep of the family saw through her facade the whole time while his aunts/uncles accepted her into the family. This was the reason for the fight with Harlon, knowing marta's intentions to try and swindle the family fortune. This was why he sent the money to have Daniel Craig investigate. Pretty clever! Or at least I thought so until they showed otherwise. It turns out it's as formulaic as, hey, the kid no one likes in the family, that has never worked and is the biggest freeloader of all, turns out to be a vendictful murderer because he isn't getting any part of the will. Furthermore, as stated, the wealthy good for nothing white family gets misplaced by the migrant as she peers from ""her"" balcony beckoning them to leave her palacial estate. Oohhhhh how the tides have turned.Now... For a few other gripes since I'm a Nurse Anesthetist and give these drugs for a living. You'd never give 100mg of toradol (ketorlac) to anyone, especially not an 85 year old person due to its effect on kidney function. Stupid but I get it. 2nd, there are no 100mg vials of morphine because that is in fact a toxic dose. At most it'd be 10mg. Furthermore, even if you got 100mg of morphine, you wouldn't die, you'd just stop breathing (problematic but not death inducing). You can see Marta giving the other blackmailed mouth to mouth and then CPR so she knows how to do it. She could have just breathed for him while awaiting for paramedics. Not ideal, but certainly not a death sentence. It did nail that drugs are labeled similarly and mistakes do happen though.In the end, the tone is firmly cemented that white people are bad and don't deserve what they have.

Hilarious!You won't figure out the end till the end. It's just a fun ride the whole way through.

However, I did predict one of the main plot twists from the beginning which made the movie from that point on to be not as enjoyable as it was before. Although because I didn't reach the right conclusions from the plot twist that I knew, the hole in the donut if you will, was coming, it was still enjoyable as a whole (pun intended.).

There are 4 members in the family who get cut off for bad actions and only two of them truly did a bad action to deserve being removed from the will. Richard cheating and Joni stealing.Richard cheats on his wife Linda so Harlan wants to expose him, fair enough. But why make Linda suffer more? He should expose Richard and let her handle it, but remove her from his will?

A fun watch for anyone, especially mystery lovers.",9,15 August 2020,"A very entertaining movie, especially if you are a mystery lover, supported by an excellent cast interpreting a bunch of colourful, eccentric, (somewhat) suspicios characters, one comes to expect in these kinds of stories. I particularly love how the plot meanders from a whodunnit to a howdunnit mystery and back again.There was only one element that I didn't particularly like - the throwing up. I think it was completely unncessary and often seemed like a cheap plot machine that helped stir the direction of the story way too many times. I read that the director wanted to be hard on the character we become attached to, by removing the thing she needs to do to save herself, her ability to lie.
However, in Marta's case, I think that was unnecessary, as we see that not only she can't lie, but she does not want to lie, as a lot of the movie revolves around her kindness and how that plays out. This is why I thought the whole throwing up thing was completely unnecessary for this movie, as I think the audience was anxious just watching this kind and innocent character trying to balance between covering up what she did and feeling like she shouldn't do it. Even without the throwing up she kept being effectivelly put in a position she didn't want to be in by other characters, so I just think this element was unncessary and cheapened things at times.Overall, it was a fun watch that I would definitely recommend it.",Knives Out

2267,TheresTooManyMovies,The whodunnit where you know who did it.,4,30 December 2019,"This movie is seriously missold. Having seen the trailers I expected a good old fashioned whodunnit murder mystery.Imagine my surprise that when the characters are first interviewed the film actually shows the true version of events. It's quite funny as one story contradicts another and the over the top characters throw digs at one another. This mechanic is also used when the murderer is interviewed... So yes, the murderer is know within the first 20 minutes of the film. The film also uses a plot device where one character cant lie without throwing up. It makes the investigation farcical when the detective has a 100% accurate witness statement. He may as well have had CCTV.So the investigation you already know the ending to, you're not rooting for the murderer to get away with it (which is what the film is really about) and the rest of the characters are made to be dislikable so you're not rooting for them either. So in a 90 minute film you have zero interest in the middle 70 minutes, it is incredibly boring.The final 10 minutes has a few twists that are truly ridiculous and I'd long ago lost interest.",Knives Out

2272,stefanmohessfilms,AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE,9,11 January 2020,"I never really saw any trailers for Knives Out, I assumed it was going to be the normal mystery story, but I was wrong, ""Knives Out"" provided a fresh story, with a complex but very interesting plot. When you think you know something the film goes and proves you wrong, I didn't even see what happened at the end coming.The plot was very interesting from the death the audience were trying to come up with who done it, I came up with some suspects of my own, but I didn't see the end twist coming, when we find out who actually done it. I think when you throw people off it makes the entire film better because you want to know who did it and more importantly how.The acting was great, some standouts were Chris Evans, Daniel Craig (at first I was not very keen on the accent) and Ana de Armas.The cinematography was pretty great, we got a cool variety of shots in this film, the colours used were also really good, in a way they almost reflected the characters tones in the movie, such as Chris Evans' Character wore a brown jacket and brown is often associated with crap. In the film is personality was very dull and angry, not to say I didn't enjoy his character, but that's the vibes I get off that character.Overall I gave ""Knives Out"" a 9 star rating, I enjoyed the dark humour, the weirdness it brought with it and everything else!

The cast not only fill their respective roles superbly, but embody their characters in a manner that appears nothing less than natural. Daniel Craig's performance as Benoit Blanc is only bested by Ana de Armas' embodiment of Marta Cabrera. Any reservations one may have about the choice of director, Rian Johnson, must be set aside. This film will almost certainly redeem his credibility to any viewer frustrated with his work on The Last Jedi.""",Knives Out

The not so good: Very little character development, Daniel Craig's southern accent, and another movie in which Chris Evans is, well, Chris Evans. Maybe stick to Captain America, Chris...anything beyond that seems to be simply not great.

2280,ksmithmba,Good movie but overtly political,7,23 November 2020,"I like this movie - it's very well done. Good cast, good story. But it is also political propaganda. I do not think that is wrong or bad, I like the First Amendment. However, anyone watching this should turn on their thinking cap and realize this isn't just a lighthearted whodunit. The final scene SPOILER is literally the Dreamer standing above the entitled white people. Nice.
Now making fun of entitled rich kids is a comedy stand-by (paging Spaulding Smails). But any downtrodden member of society could have been the heroine. No, it's a dreamer. A very Hollywood stereotype dreamer. Whose boss knows her plight but only choses to remedy the situation after his death. Very much like Thomas Jefferson freeing his slaves after he died. What a gent! And in the film those who stand for legal due process and, for a better term, ""rules"" are portrayed as right-wing monsters.
I suppose Rian Johnson doesn't have any relatives petitioning ICE for legal migration. Why wait those 12-20 years to get your loved one into the country legally when you can just come here, work hard and make yourself a success. Because people aren't illegal. Just their actions, like Jeff Skilling. He didn't hurt anyone, did he?So I like the film.

Hell no, especially the twang in Mr Craig's put on southern accent did jar (at times). But the easy pace of the script , devoid of any jump cuts and adrenaline doses, was immensely enjoyable.It was so refreshing to watch a mainstream Hollywood production telling a story solely dependent on histrionics and the camera, and not on colossal set pieces and car (or any other mode of transportation) chases. Please make no mistake, I enjoy a a car chase and set piece just as much as the next guy, being an avid SciFi and comic book movie fan I would be a hypocrite to state otherwise. But of late that's all that was being served from the mainstream stock. Although it did have a car chase but it was virtually non existent and was important in the greater scheme of things.The talent involved both in front and behind the camera were of supreme brilliance. All in all a refreshingly nostalgic mode of story telling. I would refer this movie to all cinephiles.I can't say anymore without going into the spoiler zone.

I thought the movie was going to be one way, based on the promotional material, but I was mistaken. The movie isn't the typical whodunit but it is rather a beautiful twist to the genre. What I loved about Knives Out was its finely crafted and very thought out storytelling, lots of surprises with a strong sense of mystery. I must say Daniel Craig stole the show, but for me everyone was brilliant. The movie had great charm about it, but the ending really helped bring the whole movie together. My only real critique is the legality of the final outcome, but I'm no detective (you'll know what I mean when you see it). I highly recommend this film and would love to see it again to catch more my second go of it! Go see Knives Out, you surely won't be disap""pointed!""",Knives Out

2336,trashyburnemail,Little nitpicks but overall enjoyable!,8,29 November 2019,"If I have one criticism to lob at the movie, it's that halfway through it changes from a passive viewing experience to an active one. What I mean is it transitions from a movie where you are watching the story unfold with the detective, trying to figure out who did the murder, to a movie where you are expected to root for the characters and their lives/outcomes. That's not to say this is necessarily a bad choice, it's a creative take on the traditional ""whodunit"" method, but it does create a bit of tonal dissonance, and I don't feel like the main character was established well enough to make it work all the way.That said, that's really my only criticism, and everything else is done incredibly well. The shot composition is gorgeous. The dialogue is witty and funny. The movie is quirky and fully embraces the absurdity of itself. The social commentary doesn't get overbearing. The acting's also fun. It doesn't expect you to take the cheesy, cringey bits seriously, which I highly appreciated. Some performances were over the top, but it's very clear you're laughing WITH the movie, not at it.The best part of this movie, I think, is (surprisingly) the amount of rewatch value it brings, which is uncommon for a ""who dun it"" story where you already know the ending. The comedy is very well-done and well-integrated into the story. There are a lot of subtle gags that are easy to miss in the first viewing, like when a shot suddenly cuts to a shaky cam following the main character around that seems incredibly out of place at first, but it actually turns out it was the kid livestreaming on Instagram a second later. Stuff like that is really subtle, shows the creative team put in the effort, and actually makes me want to pay to see the movie again.",Knives Out

2339,michellewang-38330,A Good film but disappointing for a murder mystery,7,1 December 2019,"First of all, I enjoyed the film. Loved the music and the shots. The beginning part was great, with all the shots of the house (love the house) and slowly moving up to the important scene. If you are looking for a light, entertaining film, this is a good choice. Just don't take it as a sophisticated mystery that requires your logical reasoning.
So the three stars off is because I'm a big fan of Agatha Christine, and this story is not strong enough to be called a murder mystery for me. When I see the beginning: murder inside a house with fixed suspects, questioning with each person and finding holes in their words, they just shouts Agatha to me. But then what? All threads lead to our main character Marta. Other characters seems to just stand there, fighting each other, fighting against the will. What's their role in this murder mystery? Their verdicts, or just overall story, contributed almost nothing to the mystery, except for family drama. The whole movie just feels like Marta, Ransom, and other family members, what's the fun in guessing the murderer then?
Then there's our victim. I have no idea why someone would want to leave his fortune to his nurse, or slice his own throat for her. I mean yes, they have good relationships, and he wanted his family to do their own things instead of relying on his fortune. But he can always donate, right? How close he has to feel towards Marta to leave all his fortune to her and believe she could do the right thing? Furthermore, how close their relationship has to be to let him decide to slice his throat just to cover up for his nurse? I mean that's some painful way of death. And do people commit suicide by slicing their throat? If Harlan wants to cover for Marta, surly he would choose a method looking more like a suicide, like cutting the wrist? stab into his chest? I don't know. Anyway Harlan is waaay too good to Marta, in a way beyond my normal senses.
Lastly, the twist in the end was good, but... the whole story could have ended if they saw the surveillance camera or footprints on the muddy path. I mean Ransom didn't even try to cover it up. It's just coincidence both of them went through the same path. There are way too many coincidences in this story, including this, and the double mixing up bottles, the old lady who just happened to sit by the window that faces the secret path. If Marta chose a different way of creating alibi, Ransom would have been spotted the first day of our detective's investigation. So in short, a mystery that could have been solved early on if not for an coincidence.
This film could have been my favorite of the year. I mean the genre, the beautiful house, my favorite detective style, and all the good actors, but in the end I went out of the theater feeling mixed. I guess great anticipation usually comes with great disappointment...",Knives Out
2340,theyeojinchronicles,A captivating film that adds a mature touch to the classic whodunnit.,9,2 December 2019,"Knives Out is perhaps one of the best pictures of 2019. The strongest point is, without a doubt, Rian Johnson's script. The dialogue is so biting, smart, and outright funny that I, someone who falls asleep in movie theaters, couldn't help but to sit on the edge of my seat. The recurring misidentifying of Marta's ethnicity was a clever joke laced throughout the movie and brought to light at the most natural and creative moments. The cinematography is breathtaking, my favorite being the scene in which the Thrombleys learn that Marta will gain all of Harlan's assets. The transition from the stationary shots to the chaos-reflecting, hand-held shot following Marta fighting through the swarm of the family is brilliantly jarring. While Daniel Craig's accent is a bit odd, it fits his character as the classically stereotypical detective in a whodunnit. Chris Evan's performance as a smug killer is a refreshing take from his all-American, goody-two-shoes Captain America, proving his versatility. Knives Out is a brilliant film that I recommend to anyone and everyone.",Knives Out

I really liked that the plot was well taught out and pays attention to detail.One example that i really liked was the explanation for when Martha chose the wrong medication bottle. Here Mr Blanc gave the explanation that she had taught herself through experience to know the difference between the different medication-liquids, and hence did therefore not look at the medical logo when choosing the bottle. Rather she subconsciously just took the right liquid by remembering the weight, colour or perhaps better explained as the ""feel"" of the liquid. I do believe this to be something that we do often in daily lives and found it to be a clever detail to introduce!The other clever detail i enjoyed was the logic Mr Blanc used when revealing that the conversation between Heugh and the father had steered over to Martha.

2379,t-00876,"'Knives Out', a Modern Murder Mystery",9,22 January 2020,"If you are someone who is a fan of predictability and simplicity, then Knives Out, directed by Rian Johnson (who also directed the very controversial Star Wars: The Last Jedi), is not the film for you. Most of the film is set at an old mansion, the Thrombey estate, which is almost a character itself. The opening establishing shot shows the mansion, enveloped in fog, giving it and the film an ominous and mysterious feeling right off the bat. After Harlan Thrombey, a successful mystery writer and the patriarch of the Thrombey family, celebrated his 85th birthday, it appeared as if he had killed himself in his study late one night. While suicide is the most likely cause of death, the anonymously hired detective Benoit Blanc suspects that there had been foul play. Detective Blanc interviews family members, uncovering each of their lies, and using his deductive skills to find the guilty party.
The movie is an exciting ride with a surplus of twists and turns that keep the viewers on their toes and excited for the next detail to be uncovered. The way the movie plays out makes you feel as if you are inside one of Harlan's mystery novels. Detective Blanc solves his crimes, notices clues, and carries himself in a similar way to the character of Sherlock Holmes, except Knives Out is much more realistic and plausible. With a number of A list actors like Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc and Chris Evans playing Ransom Drysdale, not only is the cast quite impressive, but their roles matched perfectly. Daniel Craig had the opportunity to let loose and be less serious than in other films of his like James Bond, embodying a goofy, charismatic, and genius detective that notices the smallest details and always seems to find the answer. Chris Evans plays the role of a snobby grandson that had everything handed to him on a silver platter, and he fits the role like it was a match made in Heaven. The costumes of each character are on the spot as well, they seem to tell part of the story about the characters. For example with Ransom, he is often dressed in expensive clothing and clearly doesn't care for his expensive things, it reflects how he is entitled because of his family's money and really hasn't done anything by himself. The setting of the film, the Thrombey estate, is masterfully done as well. It's easy to notice all of the knick knacks related to Harlan Thrombeys novels, and these objects along with the ornate decorations in the home add to the idea of mystery and the theme of wealth. Things like the chair with knives around it played an important part of the film as well, as different members of the family were being questioned, they were almost framed by the knives surrounding them, it also seems to relate to the doughnut that detective Blanc always talks about (you'll understand if you see the film). With a well thought out setting along with costumes, I'd expect nothing less than a fitting score that adds to the drama and mystery of the movie, and that's exactly what we got. With classical style music played by an orchestra and the occasional piano solo, it does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat during an exciting scene and makes you really feel the drama and mystery of the moment. Over all, the setting, cast, costumes, and music were spot on.
The cinematography and editing was outstanding as well, capturing the mansion in an interesting way, emphasizing all of its details and decorations. Rian Johnson also relied on flashbacks to clarify who did what and when they did it. These flashbacks are used at the end of the film to helpfully wrap up the mystery and explain it to anyone who may not understand or hadn't guessed the outcome. Some say the plot was the same as every other murder mystery, they are not wrong and that's because it's a very specific genre, the name murder mystery explains the basis of each film, there is some sort of murder and then some sort of mystery. If you come into the film expecting anything more than a whodunnit style, you'll be disappointed, it's stays true to the murder mystery structure. Knives Out has a certain degree of predictability but also has many twists and turns that will take you by surprise. The mystery isn't as much as who killed who, but how the supposed murder was carried out.
In the end, Knives Out is an outstanding whodunnit film that is not only mysterious, but also comical and emotional at times, and it is definitely worth the watch.",Knives Out
2380,ryanb-90356,Superb Characters and Strong Motifs,8,24 January 2020,"Is there to be a return to classic murder, ""whodunit"" films? Director Rian Johnson believes so with his latest, Knives Out. In the runtime of 131 minutes, the plot progressively thickened and had as many twists as a Twizzler. Following the death of the wealthy Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), grandfather of the affluent Thrombey family, a private detective is hired to investigate the possibility of murder. All of the family members were present the night of Harlan's death, so each is investigated to find the guilty. Beyond the rather basic plot of a detective solving a crime, complicated and modern themes are incorporated to add significant depth.In many regards, Knives Out follows an overall simple plot of a detective working to solve a murder. However, in detail, it strays from standard practice which supports and hurts the film. A classic ""whodunit"" mystery, such as Clue (1985), follows a group of characters working to discover who the murderer is among themselves. The guilty person, or people, are usually not revealed until the end to keep the viewer guessing and involved. The person who killed Harlan Thrombey was revealed within the first quarter of the two-hour-long film. This unanticipated event changed the plot and point of view of the mystery for the better and worse. Instead of the whole cast being of equal importance, the plot stuck to a limited group of characters, and it was rather easy to tell who the guilty were. This somewhat worked for the film as it was able to bring in different and complicated motifs, such as loyalty, family, and new versus old in unique and unexpected perspectives.The development was superb for both the lead and supporting characters, but there was missed potential by not using the complete cast to its fullest. The lead private detective, Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, brought life and humor along with the impressions of expertise. He shared many qualities with Sherlock Holmes, only Blanc is ironically a southerner and Daniel Craig is British. Benoit teams with Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), a young woman who works at Harlan's house as part of the help, to search the estate for clues of a murder. Blanc thinks he can trust her because every time Marta tells a lie, she throws up. These two characters, along with the disliked and arrogant Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), grandson to Harlan, are primarily the lead characters in the plot. Although they were excellently played and intriguing to watch, the remaining cast of around ten was rather only for support. This was disappointing as they all were beautifully developed and had depth, such as the two teenage grandchildren who both had extreme but opposite political views. This was especially true with Harlan's children and in-laws, who all had complex perspectives and motives, from Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon) who aimed to take over his father's production company but was fired instead, to Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson) who was cheating on his wife, Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis). As previously discussed, if the film was more similar to that of Clue, more of the fascinating characters would have been involved and the film would have even more depth.What kept this movie going was the beautifully designed characters and the excellence in their portrayal by the actors. Also, the dialogue was current and felt real to modern-day issues, the cinematography illustrated the beauty of the setting and created tension, and the strong motifs helped incorporate depth. The only negative was the somewhat see-through plot, which is essential in a mystery. Although it was unique, it was disappointing to not see the cast be used to the fullest.",Knives Out
2381,joifulnoise,A Love Letter to Agatha Christie,10,2 February 2020,"After seeing this in the theaters, I couldn't wait to tell everyone about it! It was SO well done! It was like a beautiful tribute/homage to Agatha Christie. She would have absolutely loved this. Everything about this was perfect and had me on the edge of my seat. Daniel Craig was brilliant in this role and I just know he had a blast playing detective. I loved the rest of the cast as well, they were perfectly selected. Jaime Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, etc. But Ana De Armas gave us such a fantastic and convincing performance which I think deserves some recognition at the Oscars. The director Rian Johnson is absolutely brilliant to come up with this and it's clear that he put so much time and effort into it. I mean there was so much well-executed detail you had to pay attention; something important happens in every scene and you don't want to miss it. I love how each character, no matter how much screen time, had an integral part in the case. It really felt like a classic murder mystery with an even bigger twist. It had just the right amount of drama without coming off too much like a soap opera. The great thing about the ending is that you truly don't see it coming. I had so much fun watching and if there is a book version I'm definitely going to read it. I'd recommend this to anyone. I absolutely loved this film and it's definitely going to win some Oscars!",Knives Out

2384,nadejka,Exciting classic detective!,9,13 February 2020,"This is an action-packed American detective, designed in the classical style of the genre. This movie was directed by Rian Johnson. He was also a screenwriter and producer. He was inspired by the famous stories of Agatha Christie and wanted to make a mystery movie about the murder.
The plot of the film revolves around the mysterious death of a famous writer who suddenly committed suicide in the presence of all his relatives.
The plot scheme is simple: all heroes find themselves in a confined space and one of them suddenly dies. The police are creating an obvious and believable picture of what happened. And then a damn savvy detective enters the scene. He gradually finds a bunch of mysterious inconsistencies, and each hero reveals significant motives for the murder.
The family of wealthy writer Harlan Tromby gathers in a posh mansion to celebrate his anniversary. In the morning, grandfather is found with a throat. The police arrive, and the heirs are locked in the house, like spiders in a bank. The police are ready to admit suicide, but the famous detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, intervenes.
All relatives of the deceased were very dependent on his money and they all claim a rich inheritance. And the detective himself doesn't know who hired him.
Further, the director shows us a fascinating investigation, which strictly complies with all the laws of the genre. The story unfolds like a ball of thread, gradually opening the curtain of secrecy. At the same time, the creators deliberately try to confuse you in order to maintain interest. This is the most difficult trick in such kind of films. The movie is breathtaking. All characters are different and their images are vivid.
The moral in this film is simple and says that you need to remain a good person, no matter what.
The visual style makes the film very atmospheric. Almost all the scenes in the film unfold in the mansion.
With a relatively small budget, the director was able to assemble a very worthy cast: Daniel Craig, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and distinguished Actor Christopher Plummer.
I strongly recommend this detective, especially if you like this genre of films just like me!",Knives Out

2393,holahanjessa,I really wanted this to be good,3,29 February 2020,"I don't normally pay attention to oscar season but with such amazing movies like Parasite and JoJo Rabbit getting nominations I decided to check this one out. The first 30 minutes or so of this movie are very solid, and the set design is what really drew me in though. After that however, I kept waiting for it to be good and for it to get more suspenseful but it never did. I realized that it never got good because pretty much all information about the family was found out in the interviews. Then, it was revealed that the muderee actually killed himself halfway through the movie. I kept waiting for that to be a fakeout but it never was. The nurse character who thinks she killed him for some reason, the detective takes a liking to her, showing her evidence. (Even though she should still be treated as a suspect but I guess it is because of the puke whenever she lies thing). The detective's accent is very bad I could tell he was British the first time he talked. Micheal Scott does a better southern draw in The Office when they are playing that murder mystery game. I don't know why they didn't just make him french or British because that still would have fit with the character. The part that ruins it for me however is the culprit. He is the most obvious bad guy ever. He literally acts the most like a jerk and his name is literally Ransom. Where they even trying? A smarter writer would have made him a red herring. That's what I thought he was because the ""You're Back Again Ransom"" was so painfully obvious. When he was revealed to be the culprit I was hoping it was a fake out and when it wasn't I was so unsatisfied. Also, if he didn't hire the detective the cops would have assumed it was just a suicide so he foiled his own plot? It doesn't help also how the nurse is with him half of the movie and he is the only character with any character development. I do love the critique of the rich vs poor as a theme in a movie but it is so poorly done here. The only way we ""know"" that the rich family is bad and the poor nurse is good is because the detective keeps saying it. Come on, show don't tell. I don't know how this got nominated for an oscar because I agreed with a lot of the choices this year and this film is just messy. Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis did what they could with this lazy script. I can't believe I'm saying this but the Netflix film ""Murder Mystery"" with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston is more enjoyable and true to the murder mystery format. I would recommend watching that instead.",Knives Out

2399,mcguir-86963,A Modern Who Done It,6,18 March 2020,"Knives Out is a modern ""who done it,"" starring Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale; Jamie Lee as Curtis Linda Drysdale; Michael Shannon as Richard Drysdale Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera. A dysfunctional family comes together for an 85th birthday party for well off writer; when the party turns out to be more than expected. Linda, Ransom, and Walter battle over their father's inheritance with his nurse.In my opinion, the theme and focus of this film touches on many different areas. The main focus is on the plot, the classic mystery detective, Benoit Blanc continues to unravel the ball of yarn. Marta continues to try and fulfill the wishes of her friend and employer. This part of the theme focuses on the complexity of human relationships. An 85-year-old man in his final days fending off the money grab; Marta, his only friend in his full house of family, everyone treated him kindly for his money. The truth of human nature can sometimes be cruel.I think the setting and the music and visual elements used in the film enhance the story itself. The High-key and Low-key lighting in the mansion establishes the mood for the movie early on. From the first scene, the music and large estate give you the feeling you're in the film or the board game Clue. Ironically, it is even said in the movie by one of the detectives, ""The guy practically lives in a Clue Board"". The suspenseful score and the several internal conflicts between the family; no one knows what will happen next! This is typical of films focused on the plot; however, the first twist comes early on when Harlan turns out to be aware his death is imminent. The dramatic irony is pretty heavy in this film, from the beginning to the end.The story flow of the movie was unique and exciting. The editing was an essential part of this film. The way the story is told from several different perspectives was the best part of the film, in my opinion. Seeing how each character remembered the events of the evening piece by piece (no matter how biased or untruthful) helped put Detective Blanc on the path to finding the guilty party. The theme of the film was emphasized by the music, lighting, and setting techniques used in the film. The story was told from several points of view and was impressive.",Knives Out
2400,lelkasmail,Definitely cost to watch,9,20 March 2020,"I guess you can't come up with a better gift for detective fans than Ryan Johnson's ""Knives Out"". This screenplay keeps the audience in an atmosphere of intrigue and humor until the final credits.A successful mystery writer decided to commit suicide. However, it is unclear why he did it or whether it was suicide. When the whole family meets to discuss the division of the inheritance, private detective Benoit Blanc comes to find out the real circumstances of the death of the head of the house.The detective often shows his cynical humor. In one scene, he said : ""When people get desperate, they get out their knives"". This explains the meaning of the film's title.Throughout the film the audience observes the intrigues that are built mainly on the dialogues of the characters.

2408,pritambhattacharyya-49800,End twist is the biggest attraction,9,25 April 2020,"Knives Out is a 2019 American mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson and produced by Johnson and Ram Bergman. The film features an amazing cast- Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell, and Christopher Plummer.
The film plots around the death of Harlan Thrombey a famous crime novelist. He invites his family to his Massachusetts mansion for his 85th birthday. The next morning Harlan's, housekeeper Fran when came to his room for giving breakfast she found Harlan dead, with his throat cut. The police were sure it was suicide, but an anonymous person hires Benoit Blanc (played by Daniel Craig) to reinvestigate the case. From here starts the main story. Benoit after questioning the family members learn that Harlan's relation with his family was not so good: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard (played by Don Johnson) for cheating on his wife Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's(Toni Collette) allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt(Michael Shannon ) from his publishing company, and had a noisy argument with his grandson Ransom(played by Chris Evans)
the black sheep of the family.After the family members interrogation enters Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Harlan's nurse. Marta had a problem that she couldn't lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. This is so because she knows she is directly related with Harlan's death. The truth was after the party, she, accidentally administered Harlan an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication, and then realized what she had done upon seeing the label on the medication vial. She was not able to find the antidote naloxone leaving Harlan minutes to live. In order to protect Marta, Harlan gave her instruction to create a false alibi so that she is not suspected for his death. At first Marta refuses to do so as she knew she would vomit for telling lies. So Harlan told her to tell the truth but in incomplete form. He then cut his own throat and Marta carried his instructions. Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence of her guilt. Harlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta and his family members were astonished at this decision. He said in his will, ""I Harlan Thrombey being of good sound and mind leave my business, all assets and mansion to Marta Cabrera"". At first the family members started blaming the lawyer and they turn on to her, but Ransom helps her to escape. Ransom then takes her to restaurant where he persuades her to confess and offers to help her from being caught by the detective in exchange for his share of the inheritance. Marta then receives an anonymous blackmail letter of Harlan's toxicology report where it was written in bold ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID"". She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but the building has been willfully destroyed by fire. Marta then receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the medical examiner's office, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief car chase, the police arrest Ransom. Marta then goes to the address as received in the email. Upon reaching there she discovered that Fran was unconscious and drugged at a high dosage. In her hand there was there was the missing medical report of her own. Marta at first hesitates thinking that Fran would expose Marta's crime, but finally calls 911 emergency and takes her to the hospital. Marta on her way to the hospital confesses to Blanc about her sin, but she was unaware that Ransom had already informed about her. At the house, Blanc finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's flower pot. Blanc reads it, and then interrupts Marta before she can confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death.Here comes a big twist in the story. Blanc now reveals the true incident: After Ransom had an argument with Harlan at the party and he learned that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta he became angry and left the party. But he didn't actually leave. He just went outside the house to make sure that in the security cameras it showed he left. He then returned through the back door and swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the slayer rule. However, Marta actually injected the correct medicine unknowingly without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to expose Marta as a murderer. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. After that when the call from Fran's hospital came Marta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife, but it is a retractable false stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and arrest him. Marta asks Blanc when he realized she played a part in Harlan's death, and Blanc responds that he knew from the beginning, noting a small spot of blood on one of Marta's shoes. As the police takes Ransom into custody, Marta watches the Thrombey family depart from what is now her mansion.The plot of Knives Out is enjoyably, wickedly twisted. Even if the audience already guesses who has committed the crime, it won't be easy to figure out who actually has. The movie's pleasures lie in the way how these characters, each of them though well-defined always against one another even when they are pretending to be on the same side. The twist at the end of the plot is the main area of attraction for the audience. According to me it is a must watch film for all thriller movie lovers.This was the review of Knives Out,

2420,rambrostrecon,A modern update to the classic whoddunit,10,21 June 2020,"Written and Directed by Rian Johnson, Knives out is 2019 film starring an assemble cast including Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a world-famous private investigator. Lakeith Stanfield as Detective Lieutenant Elliott, A local police detective, and Christopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey, a wealthy mystery writer and the family patriarch. The film follows the Thrombey family as they are interviewed by Elliot and Blanc who are searching for Harlan's murderer after he is found dead the morning after his 85th birthday party. The films overall theme is that of having being kind in a world that is cruel. We see this through Marta Cabrera, Harlan's nurse, played by Ana de Armas. Marta is presented as innocent and honest. She even has a medical condition which makes it impossible for her to lie without becoming violently ill. This innocence is so endearing that viewer continues to root for her in the third act of the film after her actions are revealed alongside the other family members.Viewers will likely see similarities between Knives Out and other classic murder mystery movies such as Clue and Murder on the Orient express. The films unique use of editing and framing set it apart and make it a worthy modern take on the genre. Rian Johnson routinely frames his shots with a Wes Anderson level of reverence for symmetry. This used particularly well in interview scenes where Elliot and Blanc are speaking to a single family member. This attention the shot composition and framing come to the forefront again in the way interviews are positions in front of a sculpture of large array of knives.The films editing and sound design takes advantage of flashbacks and voiceovers to tell its story. Elliot, Blanc, and other characters use voiceover to narrate what the audience is seeing in a flashback. As the story progresses, the audience is shown the same event from multiple perspectives. What appears normal in one person's flashback, is revealed in another person's to be part of a larger plot. As the movie reveals its plot twist and the twist upon that twist, these flashbacks paint a clear picture and allow the audience to solve the crime along side the detectives. The films climax and final reveal are extremely satisfying because this editing technique immerses the viewer and makes them feel involved in the investigation.Overall, knives out is an extremely fun movie with a familial theme that many movie goers can likely sympathize with. Rian Johnson did extremely well in this update to a genre that has seemingly fallen out of favor with large studios as of late.",Knives Out

Predictable ending. This was a mystery?
Humor fell flat for me so wasn't a comedy
the political statements were too muted so not intellectual
Not enough character depth to care about the outcomeI really don't understand the high reviews. Bots maybe? After watching it I felt like my time wasn't well spent. Good for a plane/train ride, not at home when you have other options.",Knives Out

2445,likeasir-65369,A beautiful movie with a very one-sided story,5,3 January 2021,"I liked the production, but the movie has an incredibly simplistic one-sided storyline (rich people are bad, poor people are good).I guess that their entire purpose was sending a social message with a fairytale instead of coming up with a believable plot.A huge letdown for me. It doesn't come close to ""Parasite"" where they exposure the shortcomings of both social classes in a hilarious way. Instead, Marta (Ana de Armas) is portrayed as an angel with a pure heart and no ulterior motives while the whole Thrombey family is evil, greedy, and highly dysfunctional. .The acting is top-notch though, which is why this movie deserves 5/10 instead of 2/10.",Knives Out
2446,electro-18349,Best Mystery Solving film I've seen,9,10 November 2020,"This movie was one of the best mystery problem solving films I have ever seen. For starters, the film was kind of like a usual film with suspense and drama, action and a mighty twist at the end to spice things up. But the twist did spice things up, which makes it one of the best. But first the cast. Chris Evans hasn't done many other films other than big blockbuster Marvel films, so to see him not in a red and blue hero suit was different and makes everyone realise that he is a good actor and not just a action hero. Bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger, sorry Arnold. But overall, I believe that Chris Evans did a good job as Ransom Drysdale. The main character of this film was thankfully a woman, played by the beautiful Ana De Armas who has previously shown her talents in the very successful add on to the 1982 Blade Runner, in the film Blade Runner 2049. She has shown the world that she has talent and portrays her talent very well in this film. She makes the character feel like an everyday person, like it was based on a real life individual. Which makes you realise that some people deserve more. Throughout the film, I believe she was a delight to witness on the big screen. Also, I loved Marta's psychological condition of not being able to lie; otherwise it makes her throw up. That has to be one of the best script writing effects I have seen in a film. And last but not least, James Bond. Wait, not James Bond; Detective Benoit Blanc. Who was played by none than the other, Daniel Craig. I would say that Daniel Craig did struggle on the accent from time to time, in scenes you can see him mess a few of his lines. But on the other hand, the way he portrayed the mystery of his character throughout the whole film was marvellous. He did make me think that the case was all closed with around 20 minutes of the film remaining. But it carried on, in an ultimate twist. Also, the walking stick does add a strange but decent effect when he doesn't have a limp but makes him look like a detective.
In other news, the editing of this film I believe was well done. It wasn't award winning but they did a good job to make us feel the suspense and mystery. For example, in the closing scene of the film the family are out of the drive way looking at the murderer drive off in a police vehicle and looking up to someone. The close shots of the character up on the balcony made us see the emotions and the high pitched music made us ask the question, what happens now? The cinematography, I believed was outstanding. All the specific choices of camera shots and locations were brilliantly planned. They made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters and watching from behind the scenes of what was going to happen. Which brings me to the location of this film set. The film was filmed in many locations, including Maynard, Waltham, Easton etc. But the main set for this film is the Ames Mansion in Borderland State Park. This film set was precisely the best set for this film. The mansion shows the wealth of the family and also shows the discreetness of the family. Which is a big effect in the character's individual stories. Also the characters fashion sense. I am no modeller, but pretty sure anyone can tell who is wealthy and who isn't. For example, all the related family are wearing expensive jumpers and even the little kid (Jacob Thrombrey), played by the uprising star from the hit movie ""IT"" (Jaeden Martel), wears an expensive looking suit. All of these effects adds to the character backstory of this family.
Overall, I believe that this film was one of the best mystery problem solving films of all time. And with the numerous number of nominations they received, even a Oscar nomination for Writing (Original Screenplay) for Rian Johnson, it was a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch and get your head round. It very much so, does make you think of who could it be and why and how? Which is why I am rating this film a 9 out of 10.",Knives Out

I don't judge the book by its cover (and a movie by its cast). What compelled me to praise ""knives out"" is the performance given by whole of the cast, a perfectly indulging storyline and the twisted roller coaster ride till the rolling out of credits.
If you are into mystery / thriller genre, this movie is going to stay in your mind for a long long time. Just do yourself a favor and don't watch the trailer prior to watching it. And DON'T dig for spoilers.

We still do not have the full evidence on who the killer was.It could be the person acting and controlling vomiting for very long time.
(Yes. The person could have noticed the other character's swapping action and made the whole story up on one's side.)
It could be the person who wanted to make the last real-story novel by master minding all the pieces by sacrificing himself.

It is witty and funny, every character is a little bit exaggerated but still very believable, and the main character is incredibly likable.

The nurse accidentally gives her patient 100mg of morphine through an IV and he miraculously stays conscious for at least 10 minutes while they figure out a plan and execute it. The next criticism is a continuation of the first, the lady is a nurse therefore she would easily know something is in fact a miss since the guy stays conscious after the so called massive overdose.

I mean, why wouldn't they be, considering what an incredible list of actors there are in this? But really, they all were on top game with their acting. You know you're going to get great performances when you can see that the actors are genuinely having the time of their life playing their characters. They were just chewing it up and the banter between them was so entertaining to watch. Rian Johnson is an amazing writer and director, there is no doubt about it. I did not want to see the movie end because I was just having a blast and then when it did, I immediately wanted to see it again. For hours after seeing it, I just kept playing parts over in my head and thinking ""My God! That was brilliant!"" With the theaters recently over-dominated with superhero movies, it's so refreshing to see a classic who-dun-it movie, and one done so perfectly well.

All in all, a well spent 2 hours of my time. Definitely a movie I would recommend, even just to hear Daniel Craig's accent.",Knives Out

2506,jettison-27,Pretty disappointing.,6,17 March 2020,"Honestly 6/10 is pretty damn generous. This is one of the most predictable murder mysteries I have ever seen, which in itself is bad enough as the main point of a mystery is to have twists and unexpected reveals. There weren't really any likable characters and it was difficult to root for anyone, even the main character. The barfing thing cheapened the whole experience and the role it played in the plot was painfully obvious each time. The attempt at humour was off-putting in its carelessness and lack of finesse; t genuinely felt at times like the script had been written by a child. The stylistic aesthetics and star-studded cast certainly draw you in and the score does its best to captivate your imagination, but none of these elements could drown out the sheer mediocrity of the storytelling, the weak and lackluster plot and the almost pitiful attempt at creating 'mystery'. There were little moments here and there that were decent and at times it seemed like there was potential but sadly the result was seriously underwhelming and unmemorable.",Knives Out

I tried to stay away from excessively watching trailers or reviews to come in with as little of an expectation as I could. Which for me was hard. I adore the entire cast, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Rian Johnson's earlier work (Star Wars excluded), and I got caught up in the nostalgia of a thrilling ""whodunnit"". Upon seeing it, I was very quickly shocked by the lack of originality, the completely cheesy dialogue, and a horrendous and obvious plot. I have never walked out of a theater in my life but this is the closest that I've ever come. I openly laughed at how bad the dialogue and plot points were. The entire theater was silent except to grimace. Don't waste your time or your hopes.",Knives Out

It attends everything, and even more of what you can expect from it.Ana de Armas leading the movie like no other is first great plot twist. perfect.
Daniel Craig, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon... Come on. Basically everyone excelled their acting... How do you obtain such outstanding precision in performance and dialogue?Rian... Rian, you genius son of a coffee mug. Sweater sucker. You are the answer to that. To all of that. The answer to all of hollywood. From the inside you are showing them what originality is, how it's properly done in all levels.In all levels because the film attends, and which is my favourite aspect of the film, the level about Marta and his position against the one from the family. That -side by side with the final fake knife, which condensed everything in it, and was incredible- are the most important events of the film.And then... The closing shots.

We went last night and it was just a fun time at the movies and a happy diversion from all the holiday prep we've been doing. Don't regret going at all (like you do with some movies).Knives Out recalls the days of the black and white PI movies and the television shows of the 70s and 80s, while bringing the genre firmly into the modern age.It felt formulaic at times. That said, there were enough surprises to make you laugh, think, or even cringe and that keeps it from being too predictable! We were delightfully surprised that we couldn't figure it out completely. As one reviewer said, the tie-up wasn't quite a surprise (the Who) but the rest (how it all comes together) had some elements we were surprised about.It walks the line between brilliant new Whodunit and tongue-in-cheek throwback parody. There are enough references to previous renowned PIs (without shoving them in your face) to make it feel almost a parody. Especially with quips like, ""CSI KFC"". Yet, they have created a unique Whodunit in wonderful style that mostly keeps you interested.There were points (especially in the middle/middle-end) where I felt it dragged a bit, but it picked up again quickly and we were drawn back into the story almost as soon as I realized I was getting restless.I personally think the actors were the best part of the whole thing. I realize they are actors and this is their job, but it seemed like they were having a ball with their typecast/stereotyped characters. Most notably, Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. It was pure joy watching them enjoying their roles so much. You could feel their fun coming off the screen. It didn't hurt that these are roles we don't relate to these gentlemen often so it was such delicious fun to watch. (Seriously, good-guy Captain America to spoiled Trust Fund Playboy? He had so much fun with it.)Overall, it probably won't end up in my top 10 favorite movies. At the same time, if it's on, I'd probably watch it again and again.",Knives Out

Classic adaptation of the murder mystery genre, there were some superbly entertaining (and genuine) moments, like when the family hears the news at the will reading for the first time and how they each react to it. Likely, as the detective begins to find incremental evidence of the crime having been committed by someone other than the nurse of the Grandfather. As he holds on to the few clues at first, from the nurse and the grandson's relationships with her, then with further testimony of the evidence of the murder, detective's deveopment of the story, movie spirals into an unexcpeted comical-tragical piece of America, a story of an American family who disintegratse, not only banished from inheritance but disintegrating fast from a united family into hungry animals with each their motive for wanting that final sum of money.While the plot is somewhat predictable, it is the story is one of love, family, and honor. Superb casting, with Christompher Plumet, Chris Evans, to Daniel Craig, Toni Collete, and Daniel Craig, leading the show, and amazing final back-to-back renditions of the nurse and the grandson, this film isa brilliant showpiece, both tragic and comical. 9/10!",Knives Out

The characters are all very hyperbolic and the situations are pretty unrealistic but the framing and tone of this movie makes it fit very well! In an era where it seems like realism is what all movies are measured by it was refreshing to see Rian Johnson wash the taste of TLJ out of our mouths with a witty, well made, Clue-esque mystery that remains engaging and unpredictable all the way through.

Nothing is missing--humor, inventiveness, visual style, acting--it's an alchemy of everything we love in movies, that plays to nostalgia and postmodernism with equal success.

2580,kintamako,A film that is both orthodox and talks about immigration issues,9,8 July 2020,"A film that is both orthodox and talks about immigration issues(There's a spoiler about the immigration issue at the bottom.)The structure of the work itself is similar to the suspense mysteries of the past and there is not much unexpectedness. However, it was quite interesting with an overwhelmingly interesting script and direction.I thought it was just an Hercule Poirot type of detective trying to solve a crime in a straightforward manner, but it's not, at the beginning They put a big twist on it early on, and the genre itself doesn't change as much as a Korean film does. It doesn't have one, but while it fits within the genre, it takes a turn that goes beyond expectations. These interesting and unique developments are typical of Ryan Johnson.And often interrupted are the humorous descriptions. There are some funny scenes such as bickering between family members and ugly fight. It's a very funny movie with the usual mystery direction and the setting of the house where the police inspector and the detective It's also interesting to tweak the target. I also enjoyed the slapstick of Marta, played by Anade Armas.The symbolic setting of the house and the other locations are not included in the film. As a stage play suspense mystery, this film is a classic, but interesting. It has the essence of a royal road, but the script has an unexpected twist to make it an entertaining work. The quality around the completion of the film is great.I can't talk about it in detail because it's basically a spoiler-free movie. You should go see it.As for the cast, Klieva is out of character by all accounts, and it's a big difference from what happened with Cap. She's at her best in the role. The rest of the cast is also gorgeous. Anade Armas is still a beauty.
I heard Joseph Gordon Levitt was in it, but where was he!Spoilers below on the immigration issueIt was also interesting to see how they've been able to include contemporary American issues as a major theme in this story. That is that the nurse, Ana de Armas, is an illegal immigrant. This is a certainty, as there is a scene where the family has a political debate about illegal immigration.This family compound is a metaphor for ""America"". And Marta, a nurse, is described as having been ""hired directly without the Visiting Nurse Association"". In other words, it is a metaphor for illegal immigrants who ""came directly to the country without formal registration with the state"".The film turns out that Marta was not the culprit, but one of her family members was. In other words, the U.S. is fostering and strangling the illegal immigration problem by the American people themselves. That's what I'm saying. This is a fact, and illegal immigrants coming from Mexico are coming from three Central American countries with their children. Most of them are family members.Illegal immigrants are blamed for the deterioration of security and other factors in that country, but it is their own The gang (MS-13) that was created in the United States as a result of interference in the civil war in El Salvador (MS-13), as It is the United States that has deported them. In other words, illegal immigration in the United States is the result of self-inflicted wounds.In the scene where he left all of his inheritance to Marta, the family members insisted that Marta was just like family. Falsely, he instantly changes his attitude and reveals his anger. This is a metaphor for Trump and his supporters, who claim to be America First It is the anti-immigration movement itself. Also, the fact that the youngest boy in the family is a ne'er-do-well in the United States today, mainly on the internet. The result of the Charlottesville incident is the growing number of ""alternative right-wingers"" on the .In the end, the scene where Marta looks down on the evicted family from the second floor is wonderfully poignant. The words ""MY HOUSE"" on the glass. That's how America calls itself an external enemy, playing into Trump's populism and looking inward (government). I guess he's saying that before you know it, you'll collapse from the inside out and you'll be ostracized. The ""inside"" in the play is not only about the incident, but also about the affair and the business problem of the second son. Or maybe it's the issue of tuition for Joni and her daughter, played by Toni Collette.In this way, the entire story talks about the issue of immigration. This is exactly the kind of politics that are inextricably linked to the royal mystery suspense while being inextricably attached to the royal mystery suspense. It's great that it also talks about the theme of the film. This one is a no-brainer for Best Screenplay Oscar. It's too good.Translated with DeepL Translator (free version)",Knives Out

2600,japinto,You are not understanding the magnitude of the plot of this film!,10,25 January 2020,"""Until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop and a real knife"" - Harlan says to Marta in the attic in the beginning.
Harlan wanted to die. And planned is own suicyde to the most smaller detail!
Even the title suggest it!
He planned to die (as a gamer he is referred to be) with one of his games, where he furthermore from dying, planned a lesson too is whole family especially for is completely ""stupid but confident"" grandson. By the talks he add in the night of his birthday, he predicted the behavior of all his relatives, and, justified by the ""oh, Ransom"" talk in the attic, predicted the stupid and reckless behavior that Ransom would have after being left on his own. So he made all the plan! Purposely throwing the game to the ground, inducing Marta to an error, that would annul the switch of the glasses (a way of murder that he predicted Ransom would do, as he know he is a good player), and free Marta from mistakenly killing him! And dying on his will, because he ""doesn't fear death anymore""!!
Finally he switches the knives, by knowing how is grandson was going to act, ""Until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop and a real knife"", and saving Marta. (I do not believe that having all those knives as decoration, the propose would be for them all to be prop knives.) And he enfatizes that by staying the knife in the attic' table, where probably that knife would have been a prop knife.
I know that probably I'm just making some assumption, but the Easter eggs in this film are aligned in such an order, that I can really see this to be the bigger plot in here!!

While I enjoyed his take on the franchise, there are many who don't seem to want fresh takes (at least in the main saga). Knives Out certainly delivered the film I'd been waiting for since the Last Jedi; the next new thing Johnson was working on. It certainly borrows various visuals and general ideas from classic murder mysteries (Poirot and the like), it unfolds quite differently as a movie, which works in its favour for sure.

Other than it being unlike what I expected, it was a good movie. Low toned comedy with drama and mystery. Great acting, can follow the story and keep the characters separate. I like the mystery aspect, including the father writing murder mysteries.

Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" did it beautifully, Boots Riley's ""Sorry to Bother You"" did it shockingly badly, and Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" falls somewhere in the middle.

The characters are very ""black & white"", no one has a layered personality, they are all just how they seem at first. Everyone are uppermost unpleasant people, except the old lady and the helpers ofc.
But now the real deal breaker: no even halfway through the movie you know who the killer is. I mean ofc. It is not the kind main character who it is supposed to look like it is. The police tells what happened through the night of the murder, the young Martha hears the dogs 03:00, when Hugh comes back at the day of the testimony opening, they go wild again. I mean if that isn't a giveaway I don't know what is. And if you didn't get there they make it completely obvious with the grandmother who says ""is you again Hugh?"" (Well she uses his second name, but can't remember it right now). When the detective at the end reveals what really happened it sure is a good and unusual thing that happened, but when you already know so early in the movie who it was, you just feel like the hour and a half in-between are wasted time. The actors and especially the main role where REALLY good actors, but if the movie is that poorly written they can only do so much. The ""funny scenes"" were also just to planned, you could feel the punchlines coming from miles away, before they even happened cause they just weren't that clever, and felt really unnatural.
In the defense of the movie, it maybe just ruined it a little cause I saw it in German dub. I plan to see the movie again in English and with a friend who hasn't seen it, to see how they feel about it. And then I will revisit, and update my critic.",Knives Out

However, I still rate 8 out of 10 on it, for it has remind me of the old-fashioned-suspense film, of Hitchcock and Billy Wilde, of the good old days when film masters worked carefully on original scripts,. Back to that time, 1950s or something else, Hollywood was full of creativity. It was that kind of creativity that gave birth to Star Wars, The Sting or other great films.
But look at what they are doing now! They keep making series, adapting from stories they've already have, for fear of taking the risk losing audience. They are losing their courage and inspiration. Fewer and fewer are orignal stories that can reflect our times and oursevles. Martin Scorsess did say the right thing-personally I'm a Marvel Fan,and I love Captain America and Iron man -The Hollywood is getting stale.

The whole cast seemed to be having a lot of fun with a very clever and amusing script. That sense of fun really connected with the audience. All the characters were well rounded and contributed to an excellent ensemble piece. Definitely a must watch!",Knives Out

2659,Tokorro,The charm and thrill of what can be compared to an Agatha Christie novel on the big screen,9,11 December 2019,"One of my favorite movies of the year by far.
Rian Johnson truly delivered and fantastic, thrilling, and suspenseful film that keeps the audience engaged right up until the very end.
Witty writing and great direction that come full circle once all the puzzle pieces fit and makes the audience let out an audible ""aha!"".The set and set pieces themselves give this movie a feeling of watching a game of Cluedo unfold and right from the get go you're carefully watching and listening to every detail.The cast is wonderful as well. Though not every character is major, every performance brings something to the entire movie with no one really giving off the feeling of not having to be there. Daniel Craig is obviously a stand out and every moment that he's on screen is a treat. Channeling a southern accent and being this perceptive and almost cartoonish private detective make his performance really something I was not expecting from Craig but it was wonderful to watch.The movie makes it seem that everything is already solved from the very beginning and the game has only just begun and the mystery only deepens as the movie until it eventually unravels.Rian Johnson truly deserves this success after the backlash received after Star Wars. If you love charming mystery, with a great cast, really witty and even funny dialogue that all ties into the story, then this movie won't let you down.",Knives Out
2660,mtchill,Underrated and Overrated,5,29 November 2019,"UnderratedI disliked TLJ as a SW movie and particularly disliked some of the comments made by Rian Johnson; I therefore completely understand why people are annoyed with him. However giving fictional ratings to a completely different project is just childish.There is no way this movie is worth only one star, I give it 5 stars because the acting for the most part was decent and the overall story was fine, as was the cinematography, editing, directing, etc.OverratedThere is no way this movie is perfect and giving it a positive fictional rating is just as childish.To be honest, I became bored during the first half of the movie, the second half picked up somewhat. I expected more from the cast, none of them got me emotionally involved, I was happy enough to find out how it all played out but didn't find myself caring whether any of them did it or didn't do it or were ultimately 'good' or 'bad'.Red FlagI should know by now that when a trailer has to quote critics about how funny it is then it probably isn't. I laughed out loud once during the movie and was elsewhere amused literally only once or twice. I certainly did not get the humor that everyone 'talks' about.Go see it if you like this kind of movie and judge it on it's own merits...please.",Knives Out

2663,richmon-28684,It's a mystery,4,19 June 2020,It's a mystery to me why this movie got so many good reviews. The acting is fine but the story isn't anything exceptional and is very slow moving. Add in social commentary that is so out of place that it distracts even more from an already marginal story. But I guess that's the movie business today.,Knives Out

2665,itsmeabhinav1602,BEST EVER SUSPENSE MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN...!,10,19 May 2020,"This movie will gives you the next level suspense on the murder mystery or suicidal...! Today's most of the Movies can't give you unpredictable ending or story, we knows what happened next. But I am damn sure you will not even assume who is the real guilty. The Story-line is just voilà, best ever story in suspense-drama genre movies. And lets talk about the cast....! Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc: A world-famous private detective in this move. But we know him as a #JAMES BOND 007 in INDIA in my opinion..HaHaha...! because of his some super-hit movies like Casino Royal,Skyfall, Spectre...and many more. His performance is just amazing, his acting is outstanding. Now come to our next character Chris Evans as Hugh Ransom Drysdale whom we know as #CAPTAIN AMERICA. I am also a big fan of both actor. So See them in one movie is also a best ting for me. There are many more actor whose acting is also just unremarkable. Na now finally come to the director and writer of the movie - Rian Johnson, i didn't' seen his past movies. But by this movie i'll definitely try his upcoming movie. So from my opinion ill give this movie 10/10. So guys just go and see this movie during this # lockdown and give more and more stars to get IMDB ratings 10/10 because i this it deserves 10. I skipped this movie because I thought there is so much drama and i don't like drama much, but this is just incredible I regret why I am so late to see this movie. I must had to seen this movie in theater. Literally it deserve this. This is my first ever review of those movies i have seen earlier, because i don't like typing.

Ok... First of all, I'm not American I'm actually Egyptian but since I watch quite only American movies then I guess I'm aware of the situation... I will try to be short as possible... First the good things and then the bad things that made it a 4 for me....
Good things : a who did it mystery movie in 2019 that's pretty cool to look at and refreshing, the film overall is quite well executed, taking us from a twist to another and the pacing was good, slow sometimes but hey all movies are like that, i think it's intended to keep us anticipated for anything at the end, Daniel Craig's accent is dorky at first but i liked it with time and realized it would be boring without it, it added up a good amount of silly-Ness, i honesty can't complain about anything EXCEPT... Oh brother
The bad things : I was enjoying the movie until it has turned the family into a bunch of racist self entitled white people and the poor innocent hardworking illegal immigrant, just like that... It got political, they're literally speaking about trump ( not by name ) in a scene, and then the tune carried until the end with disgusting in your face symbolic scenes, like when Chris Evans talk about his ancestors's place and then they tell him it belonged to a Pakistani and later on that scene she pukes on his face.. Wtf.. And the big finale when the ironically privileged illegal immigrant minority wins and looks at them from above drinking from the my house my rules mug.... Another thing corrupted by political agendas, if you removed that from the movie it would be decent but no they had to ruin it, and most of Hollywood no are in for it nowadays, man what a sad time we live in where everything is manipulated and corrupted, even when you try to escape and watch a fun movie",Knives Out

The direction is good, though there's a little too much bathos and again a loss of focus on the plot, which isn't the worst thing, since the plot falls apart.

First the good: it was very well acted(of course!) it was beautifully shot, it was Funny!, the mix between humor and action was balanced
The bad: the mystery side of it was shallow and very easily foreseeable, they could have built up a better sense of suspense and made it a real ""who done it"", the humor was absurd and over the top sometimes(depending on your point of view could be good or bad), the political message was weird and heavy handed in the end, it managed to avoid being too political until the finale. When it is broken down as moral message it didn't really make much sense at all.

2696,smokeyjackadirondack,Perfectly done murder mystery not based on a book,10,8 September 2021,"If you're a fan of Detective Fiction of the likes of Agatha Christie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Raymond Chandler, Dorothy Sayers, Edgar Allen Poe, etc, then you would probably really enjoy this film which was not derived from a book and so will not be disappointing in comparison. All the classic ingredients are here: brilliant detective that seems not so brilliant, many characters representing the spectrum of common personality types, the odd mansion with its rich dead patriarch and many squabbling heirs who all expect an inheritance which they cant understand that they dont deserve, the every-person who seems to be the only ""good"" person around, the red herrings, the solution and then the amended solution; one might conclude that these clichés might add up to a boring, predictable movie (and for some it may). But by using these tropes but not relying on them you have a well-designed and well-paced story. The players are not 2-dimensional as they have the contradictions that create character and most show the presence of humanity even though thier lesser desires get the best of them.Much can be said about this film (and has been in these many wonderful reviews) but in short it is a well-designed mystery with good characters and an interesting story that does not make the twists so shocking that they are ridiculous, they are reasonable and consistent. It is original enough to be notable, but common enough to be satisfying to a fairly broad group of watchers so long as they like detective fiction. Since it was written for the screen, there is much more action and visual stimuli that is not superfluous, but important to the layering of the tale, than a normal, dialogue heavy book. Nothing is perfect, but from an audience standpoint,this is as good as this genre can get.Ps: i noticed some reviews have this idea that there is a political agenda in the movie. This is not so. There are different family members with different points of view that argue about normal family topics in a believable way. No one is shown to be more correct in their views and in fact they all show some degree of contradiction in thier value systems which is good writing.If a secondary character in a story holds a position you disagree with and that position has no effect on the plot, dont be threatened by them. They arent real, and such talk and opinion is to create an understanding of character in the viewer, not an opportunity for judgment. If there is a character you completely agree with in every respect (or visa-versa), then that is an example of bad writing and/or directing.",Knives Out
