0,Leofwine_draca,Eye-tearingly awful,2,17 September 2012,"An absolutely excruciating teen horror/comedy. What makes this film so bad? Blame has to be firmly laid on Diablo Cody's script, which is so packed with wannabe-streetwise 'teen speak' that my ears were bleeding by the time the credits rolled. Seriously, Cody is like some kindergarten Tarantino wannabe, trying to make her script sound all cool and effortless. The sad fact is that real people don't act like this – and they certainly don't speak like this.The muddled storyline involves Megan Fox's high school slut being transformed into some kind of monster with a penchant for human flesh. Of course, the only person aware of this fact is her best friend, who must then figure out a way to tackle her former buddy. It sounds more interesting written there as it is in film form, because as a movie this is utterly clichéd, devoid of any interest whatsoever, and completely predictable from the outset. It goes without saying that the lame humour falls flat every time.Things become so desperate that the filmmakers throw in a gruesome sex scene halfway through, just to pad things out and keep the attention of the teen audience. There are plot holes galore, and the budget is so low that the effects are limited to a couple of appalling CGI moments which made me grimace with embarrassment. I haven't mentioned the acting yet, and that's because I don't want to: Fox is no better than a lumbering wooden plank and there's something faintly repulsive about her (even before the transformation), while Seyfried is absolutely terrible and out of her depth as the lead. Truly this is a diabolical movie.",Jennifer's Body
1,SnoopyStyle,Some good but also some problems,6,24 March 2014,"Jennifer (Megan Fox) is the hot girl popular cheerleader, and Needy (Amanda Seyfried) is the geeky plain-Jane sidekick bff. Chip (Johnny Simmons) is Needy's nice boyfriend. They live in Devil's Kettle which is named after the waterfall that drains into a bottomless hole. One night they go to the local dive bar to listen to a band headed by Nikolai (Adam Brody). The bar burns down, and a compliant Jennifer follows Nikolai off into the night. Then Jennifer shows up at Needy's house all bloody and crazed spewing out black bile. Next day Jennifer shows up at school and starts killing his schoolmates.The script is chalk full of writer Diablo Cody's dense wild dialog. Megan Fox does some of her best work in this movie. However I find several problems in this film. Director Karyn Kusama isn't able to create a scary horror. The fact is Kusama doesn't have much experience in the genre. This is no Girlfight and the comedy doesn't always work. At least she has a bit of experience with action in Æon Flux. And starting the movie with the ending already puts it in a deficit. Half of the excitement of a horror movie is that people can die. The movie starts by telling the audience that Needy is going to survive. Then there is Amanda Seyfried being cast as the plain nerd sidekick. She's way too hot to pull it off. It's a close call for me, but there are slightly more good than bad.",Jennifer's Body
2,Prismark10,Crazed encounter,4,4 August 2017,"Writer Diablo Cody won an Oscar for her screenplay for Juno. She becomes unstuck with Jennifer's Body as the film is unsure whether it wants to be a horror, a parody or a dark comedy about high school kids.Jennifer's Body was probably only green-lit with Megan Fox attached as the lead. She certainly has the face and the body but not necessarily the acting ability as the hot high school cheerleader who all the boys fancy.After an encounter with a rock band with satanic undertones at a gig where the place burns down in a fire, Jennifer has been transformed into a succubus who has to devour flesh. Her gawky geeky friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried) thinks that Jennifer is involved somehow with students turning up dead and reckons her boyfriend (Johnny Simmons) could be in danger.The film really wants to be a modern hip Carrie but director Karyn Kusama does not have the elan of Brian De Palma and the script is not good enough.",Jennifer's Body
3,claudio_carvalho,Something does not Work Well in this Flick,5,9 December 2009,"The violent inmate Needy (Amanda Seyfried) tells why she is interned in a mental institution. In Devil's Kettle, Needy is a shy teenage student that idolizes her friend Jennifer (Megan Fox), who is very arrogant. They decide to go the concert of the rock 'n' roll band Low Shoulder in the greasy spoon bar Melody Lane and the band leader overhears that Jennifer is virgin. When the place is set on fire, Jennifer is abducted by the band in their van. Later she appears at Needy's home covered in blood, throwing up a dark liquid and with a weird behavior. On the next days, many male classmates are found murdered with eaten parts of their bodies. Needy discovers that Jennifer was sacrificed by the Low Shoulder members in a black magic ritual, but something went wrong because Jennifer was not virgin and she transformed in a flesh-eater succubus. Needy tells her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) to stay away from Jennifer, but he does not believe on his words.""Jennifer's Body"" is that type of movie directed to teenage audiences that does not work well at least for adults. There are gruesome scenes but the horror is weak; the humor is not witty but only silly; the thriller is not suspenseful and in the end Juno's writer Diablo Cody disappoints in her second work. Succubus is a female demon that has sexual intercourse with sleeping men and that is not what happens to Jennifer. The conclusion, when Needy seeks out the Low Shoulder components, is the best moment of this flick, but is not well explored. Megan Fox's body in sexy scenes does not support ""Jennifer's Body"". My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Garota Infernal"" (""Hellish Girl"")",Jennifer's Body
4,kosmasp,Body Heat,8,24 November 2009,"I'm quite surprised by the voting the movie received. But then again it goes to show you, that there are quite a few different tastes out there. Jennifers Body isn't the best movie, not this year and definitely not of all time. But it's exactly what you should expect from a movie like this.Megan Fox plays her role really great, as she did in ""How to lose Friends and alienate people"" along Simon Pegg. Considering all the media attention she's getting, it must be tough for her to choose her next project. And it's nice to see the girl that was singing and dancing on a Greek island (Mamma Mia), getting her nerd on. She's the ""ugly"" duckling sort of (yeah I know, if that's ugly, I'm going to marry it) and is a strong counter point to Megan Fox.The movie is full of ambiguities and that's what I like about it. It has a great script (for a genre movie) and delivers fully on it's premise.",Jennifer's Body
5,jboothmillard,Jennifer's Body,2,9 May 2010,"I heard the critics saying that this film was rubbish, and then a not very reliable friend told me that it was pretty good, so I decided to see which opinion I would agree with, and I'm glad to say it was the critics. From the writer of Juno, this film mixes themes from Carrie, the possession of The Exorcist and apparently something to do with the film Heathers where girls enjoy murders. Anyway, basically unclassy and near slutty cheerleader Jennifer Check (Razzie nominated Megan Fox) and nerdy bookworm Anita 'Needy' Lesnicki (Mamma Mia's Amanda Seyfried) are best friends, even though they have hardly anything in common. Then all the sudden Jennifer begins to lust and appetite for human flesh and blood, and not in the sexual sense, after being in a fire in a dodgy local bar. Over the next few nights, many male classmates are found having parts of their bodies eaten, and Needy is almost trying to ignore this to stay friends with Jennifer. The reason for Jennifer doing these horrible things is because she was sacrificed for a black magic ritual, but she was not a virgin, so she has become a flesh-eating succubus. In the end, Needy, who has been relating most of the film, being in a mental prison, did indeed kill Jennifer, which is obviously why she has been placed where she is. Also starring Johnny Simmons as Chip, The O.C.'s Adam Brody as Nikolai and Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as Mr. Wroblewski. Fox may be a gorgeous creature, obviously not with her blood-covered fangs, but she is really not that good, Seyfried tries and fails to be the main star, and the gory effects just don't make the film any better, it is just a waste of time. It didn't scare me, it didn't make me laugh, and it didn't make me feel like it was worth watching, a terrible comedy horror film. Pretty poor!",Jennifer's Body
6,BA_Harrison,This came from the pen of an Oscar winner?,5,11 December 2009,"I appreciate all types of horror, from the intelligent and atmospheric to the plain dumb and gory, but in the case of Jennifer's Body, I have to admit that I just don't get it: I can't identify with the characters; I fail to understand their motivation; I don't appreciate their idiotic 'hip' language; but most of all, I just cannot comprehend what the film was trying to be. Did writer Diablo Cody intend Jennifer's Body to be a straight-up horror, a dark comedy, a teen drama, a pro-feminist tale, an allegory, or even perhaps, a mixture of all of these? Whatever the intention, it doesn't really work.Veering awkwardly from one poorly constructed scene to another, Jennifer's Body offers very little in the way of scares, laughs, or emotional content, and if there is a deeper meaning to the film—and the inclusion of recurring imagery does support this idea—then it's virtually impossible to decipher, making it all rather redundant. Even those who choose to watch in the hope of seeing Megan Fox in the altogether will be disappointed: despite playing a sex-mad schoolgirl slut who becomes a seductive boy-eating succubus, she fails to flash the goods.Of course, there is the much touted lesbian clinch with nerdy best friend Needy (played by Amanda Seyfried, who is much hotter than Fox in my opinion) to keep the lads (or ladies) momentarily happy, but a little girl-on-girl action alone does not make a good film.",Jennifer's Body
7,paul_haakonsen,Actually not that bad...,6,29 December 2015,"I have to admit that I was initially fearing that ""Jennifer's Body"" was going to be another generic teenage horror movie. But luckily it turned out to transcend mediocrity and be more than an average teenage horror.It was because of the cast that I had feared as much. I mean, Megan Fox, come on. But she actually stepped up to the plate and delivered where it counted, proving that she is more than just a pretty face.The story is about a girl who catch a ride with some questionable Guys. And fearing her gone, her friend is relieved to find her coming back home. But Jennifer is not the same person anymore; she is so much more.As for the story, well, it wasn't revolutionary to the horror genre by any means, but it was entertaining. And it delivered where it had to.The practical effects were quite good, as were the special effects. The slow breakdown of Jennifer's body throughout the movie was particularly impressive.I have seen this movie twice now, granted with years in between, but the movie does have enough contents to sustain more than just a single viewing.",Jennifer's Body
8,Quinoa1984,"the empress has one or two pieces of clothes, if not none at all",5,20 September 2009,"Diablo Cody is a name we'll be seeing and/or hearing about for a while, almost despite Jennifer's Body. While the film is directed by Karyn Kusama (also director of such girl-power flicks as Girlfight and Aeon Flux), it's the sort of situation like True Romance, where the director puts a stamp on the material as the script keeps making itself known loud and clear. I'm also pretty sure that Cody looks to someone like Tarantino as an inspiration, as do a lot of out-of-the-blue or fish-out-of-water screenwriters. But where Tarantino's 'quirky' and flamboyant dialog serves a purpose for the story and makes itself grounded in subversion of cinematic conventions - and even where Cody's Juno had characters speaking so ""hipster"" and referential as part of a cover for their own insecurities, Jennifer's Body falls much flatter. This is overwriting, a case where material about a cannibal cheerleader and her friend is fleshed out (pun intended?) by the same quirky and hipster and *knowing* dialog (there's the rub) we saw in Juno. It's just... too much for what is, let's face it, a B horror movie.And it's not without trying; somewhere, and at times right there, in Jennifer's Body there's an interesting story of two childhood friends, Jennifer and Needy, who are still friends in high school but in a bond where Jennifer is a hot-tomato of a girl while Needy is... well, maybe not too needy, but is nerdy and goes for the nice guy Chip, and whose friendship is tested by a Satanic ritual gone awry done by a Satanic band called Low Shoulder. There is one, perhaps, but Diablo Cody only cracks the iceberg of these characters once or twice, and leaves the rest of it up to cliché. Jennifer is the same from start to finish, even before her 'accident', and Needy becomes, well, crazy to be frank. It also goes without saying some of the influence of Joss Whedon's Buffy (seriously, where else aside from Sunnydale will one find an Occult section of a high school's library? come on), and Cody tries really hard there, too. And, to be fair, sometimes the movie is very funny.But it's not enough to have lots of begging-to-be-quotable lines or some competently directed horror scenes. Kusama does try her best to give it some cinematic 'umph', but it almost seems like Cody needed a stronger director to reel in her material like Jason Reitman did. Too often an annoying rock song will cue up to invariably let us know the next scene is coming up, save for Low Shoulder's ""anthem"" for the town of Devil's Kettle, which is a clever joke that becomes over-done. The acting is also middling and just fair really, as Fox acts hot and Seyfried acts worried and occasionally kick-ass in their respective roles; J.K. Simmons, as a lowly science teacher, does little with his material here, just enough to get by. And, ultimately, whatever rich psychological or sociological ideas and themes the writer and director are getting at fall short of their aims.Jennifer's Body is flashy, hip, and also oddly empty and hollow as an experience, with a few big laughs and a lot of clunkers (again, come on, ""Bowie knife, I like Bowie,"" give me a break!) If you must watch it, wait for late-night premium cable. The Empress still has some clothes, but not many.",Jennifer's Body
9,BandSAboutMovies,Not bad...,6,17 October 2018,"Jennifer's Body was written by Diablo Cody, who became known for the blog and book Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper, as well as the screenplay for Juno. Since then, she's done script revisions on the new Evil Dead as well as writing Ricki and the Flash and Tully.Named for the Hole song, this is a film about not just demonic possession, but dealing with high school and the changes that childhood friendships go through. Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicki (Amanda Seyfried) and Jennifer Check (Megan Fox) have been friends since childhood, but times are changing.Yet at the very start of the film, Anita is locked in a mental institution and unafraid to attack anyone in her way. She flashes back to her high school days with Jennifer, who was her the exact diametrical opposite. Where Anita is quiet, rude and withdrawn, Jennifer is loud, snide, sexy and popular.Everything changes on the night that they attend a concert at the local dive bar, Melody Lane, to see Low Shoulder. While the band plays, a fire explodes across the bar and kills everyone inside, except the band, Jennifer and Anita. The band leaves with Jennifer over Anita's protests. Later that night, she shows up bloody and shaking, devouring the inside of Anita's mom refrigerator and spewing black fluid all over the linoleum.Yet the next day, Jennifer is just fine. But things aren't fine any longer. The town is devastated by the fire and the captain of the football team has been devoured in the woods. The only people who are doing well are Low Shoulder, whose heroism in the fire has been noted. Now, they want to make a charity performance at the school.A month later, Jennifer is growing paler and needier, accepting a date with the school's most emo kid, Colin, to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show. While Needy is losing her virginity to Chip, Jennifer is murdering her date.Needy finds Jennifer drenched in blood and that's when the secret comes out: Low Shoulder had tried to sacrifice her for fame and fortune, but since Jennifer wasn't a virgin, she remains permanently possessed. Her first victim was the foreign exchange student that night after the fire. When she has eaten someone, she can survive any injury, feel no pain and becomes even more beautiful.Needy does her research and learns that Jennifer is a succubus who can only be killed when she is hungry. She warns Chip not to attend the school dance, where she feels that Jennifer will feed on everyone. She even breaks up with him, but he comes anyone to his doom. The two girls battle in Jennifer's bedroom before Needy is able to stab her best friend in the heart with a box cutter, ending her reign of terror.Unfortunately, Jennifer's mother only sees her daughter being killed, which is why Needy is in the asylum. As we come back to the beginning, Needy learns that a non-fatal bite from Jennifer has given her powers. She soon escapes, hitchhikes to Low Shoulder's motel (of all people, Lance Henriken gives her a ride) and gets revenge for her and Jennifer.Personally? I liked it. There's a great moment during Needy's first sexual encounter with her boyfriend where she notices all of Jennifer's victims watching, much like the theater of corpses from An American Werewolf in London. I liked the relationship between the girls and am glad they didn't follow through on the original plans to have a sex scene between them, as I felt that would have jumped too far into pure titillation.It'd be interesting to see how this film would fare if made today. In a February 2016 New York Times interview, director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight, The Invitation) said that the studio's all-male marketing department had no idea what to do with the movie, even suggesting that Megan Fox do live sex chats on amateur adult sites to drum up interest in the film. Obviously, the #metoo moment came at the right time.The only downer to this film for me is how close it is to Ginger Snaps. It hits so many of the same story beats that one wonders exactly how many times Diable Cody watched it. That said, the music is decent and this movie will keep you entertained for 90 minutes.",Jennifer's Body
10,Coventry,Always double-check your virgin before sacrificing!,6,3 July 2012,"Wow okay, I got to admit that this movie was not twice, not five times, but at least ten times better than I expected! Quite frankly, I deliberately ignored ""Jennifer's Body"" until I could watch it for free when it aired on TV. I assumed it would be just another lame teen horror movie, in the likes of the ""Twilight"" series or something, exclusively aimed at boys and girls in their puberty and revolving on the popularity issues of fresh-faced high school kids. That'll teach me to automatically assume that everything is crap nowadays! ""Jennifer's Body"" benefices from a fairly imaginative and smoothly written scenario – courtesy of ""Juno"" writer Diablo Cody – and contains surprisingly many moments of sheer old-fashioned gore horror. Additionally, the film has a compelling narrative and more than decent acting performances from the leads as well as the supportive cast. Cheerleader babe Jennifer and bookworm geek Needy attend a rock concert in the town's smuttiest bar, but only narrowly survive when the place burns to the ground. Jennifer joins the bizarrely alternative punk rock band members in their van and into the dark night, but when she reappears at Needy's doorstep later that night, she behaves disturbingly weird and hostile. During the next few days, when the entire town is mourning over the fire's casualties, Jennifer develops herself into an even hotter and more seductive girl than she already was, but actually now she needs the boys' flesh to maintain her beauty. For you see, the band guys were actually a bunch of Satanists who intended to sacrifice a virgin in return for fame & fortune. However, not being from around town, they were unaware that Jennifer is the town's floozy and therefore definitely not suitable virgin sacrifice material (""I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore"", she confesses to her friend). The ritual turned Jennifer into a lewd yet ferocious demon, and all the boys in town are extremely easy victims. I really like the concept of a satanic sacrifice going wrong, as well as all the creative sub plots and different story angles. ""Jennifer's Body"" is a 100% feminist accomplishment, as also the director is a woman (Karyn Kusama of ""Aeon Flux""). It's definitely not the greatest horror movie ever made, but I don't think any of these women aimed for that. It provides good, occasionally tense even, entertainment accomplished with the right mentality and enthusiasm.",Jennifer's Body
11,michaelRokeefe,Hell is a teenage girl.,7,6 January 2010,"It sure helps to have Megan Fox star as a newly possessed serial killer. Karyn Kusama directs this black comedy from the pen of Diablo Cody. Sultry and seductive Jennifer(Fox)and nerdy Needy(Amanda Seyfried) are BFF's and the two slip off to a tavern to see a rock band play. The tavern burns to the ground; the two BFF's survive, but Jennifer runs off with the band, who actually are a group of devil followers ready to make a sacrifice. Jennifer returns bloody and not exactly her hotter than hot self. Jen has an insatiable appetite for human flesh, particularly male flesh. Best friend Needy takes it on her own to stop Jennifer's reign of terror.A bit of gore with a borderline clever dialog; but sexy Fox is the movie's selling point. At times Seyfried resembles Dakota Fanning; and that is not a bad thing. She actually shows more acting talent than Fox. If you are visiting your ""darker"" side, JENNIFER'S BODY is really a fun watch. The soundtrack is heavy and fits the action well. Also in the cast: Johnny Simmons, Adam Brody, Ryan Levine, J.K. Simmons and Kyle Gallner.",Jennifer's Body
12,hitchcockthelegend,"PMS isn't real Needy, it was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem like we're crazy.",5,16 October 2012,"Jennifer's Body is directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody. It stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sedaris and Adam Brody. Music is by Stephen Barton and Thodore Shapiro and cinematography by M. David Mullen. Plot finds Fox as a High School cheerleader who gets possessed by a demon and starts eating the boys from school. Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.Women impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10",Jennifer's Body
13,Scarecrow-88,Jennifer's Body,6,31 December 2009,"Emo rock band, Low Shoulder, seek fame and fortune, and decide to follow instructions from a ""Satanic handbook"" offering who they believe is a virgin sacrifice to Lucifer not knowing that she has been with a guy in the past. What happens is that the sacrifice, a high school princess named Jennifer(Megan Fox), becomes demon possessed, gaining a carnivorous appetite for human flesh. Jennifer's best friend since childhood, Needy(Amanda Seyfried), knows about her condition, and as the body count rises, must stop her before her own boyfriend, Chip(Johnny Simmons)becomes a target. Needy knows that she must be present at the Devil's Kettle high school's Spring Formal Dance, because such an event provides a feast for Jennifer to choose from.This format provides Diablo Cody's script an ability to touch on such relevant topics as ""selling your soul"" for stardom, the conflicts which can split apart a friendship(..and how such a relationship is examined when something drastic changes both parties), and the way media and other outlets exploit Columbine-type(..and other high school)tragedies, while we also see the all-too-realistic harsh aftermaths inflicted on loved ones. Still, Cody's script, while provocative along with her trademark hipster dialogue(..acknowledging the tech-savvy generation while also carefully establishing characters who still dwell somewhat in the real world we live in), doesn't dwell on the gratuitous elements, and this film could've easily been a hell of a lot sleazier(..the film could've wound up like a Poison Ivy or Wild Things sequel, except with demonic, cannibalistic overtones). The movie never really goes too far over the top in regards to gore(..which it could have, if director Karyn Kusama or writer Diablo Cody so wished)and there's no sex at all. My favorite scene, and there's something more to it than just feeding those like me who get major aroused by it, has Needy and Jennifer sharing what seems to be a very meaningful, intimate exchange of delicate kisses, interrupted when both reawaken to the events that had currently transpired..the fact that she had just eaten another high school boy. Megan Fox, as this seems like a star vehicle for her, really doesn't expand on her character, and there seems to be little personality(..other than the cultural stereotype of sexpot who can devour any hormonal male within her frequency), just an empty vessel with smallish, seductive body, at times dressed in little..Seyfried(..who isn't ugly by any stretch of the imagination), on the other hand, carries this movie all the way as a ""nerdier"" teen who has clung to the friendship with Jennifer, and now must contend with the fact that she is a monster who must be stopped or else the homicides and funerals will continue. If anything, and this is quite a twist of fate, Seyfried might've established herself as a major star with this movie, as Page did with Juno. JK Simmons is hilarious as a one armed teacher always sentimentalizing on the murders of kinds in his school as the class must further dwell on the horrific details of fallen fellow students they once knew. Primarily Jennifer's dialogue features Cody's celebrated ""witty"" lines regarding female bodily fluids and pop culture references..though, there's plenty of this to go around, throughout the cast.",Jennifer's Body
14,Hey_Sweden,"""Do you know what this is for? It's for cutting boxes!""",6,7 October 2012,"Passable teen-oriented horror drama and part vehicle for sexpot actress Megan Fox stars her as high school student Jennifer, who undergoes a nasty change, to the consternation of her best friend ""Needy"" (Amanda Seyfried, who's substantially more appealing), your standard geek-who's-really-quite-attractive in the Hollywood tradition. Without spoiling too much, something causes Jennifer to morph into a monstrous predator who must now feed on assorted unlucky guys, including jock Jonas (Josh Emerson) and ""emo"" kid Colin (Kyle Gallner).Adult characters such as teacher Mr. Wroblewski (J.K. Simmons), who in one interesting touch sports an artificial hand, and parents played by Amy Sedaris and Cynthia Stevenson (both of them too briefly seen) are mostly in the background as the movie mostly sets about charting the dissolution of this friendship, and Needy's feelings on the matter, as Jennifer now takes a delight in her frightening powers. Writer Diablo Cody would do better in the future to not sprinkle in supposedly ""hip"", quirky dialogue so much as it's just a distraction, and while director Karyn Kusama and crew do give this modestly entertaining movie some atmosphere, it's a little too routine overall, and has no real resonance when it's over, despite its framing device of indicating Needy's fate. (However, it's nice to note that those responsible for the whole mess do not go unpunished.) Small doses of gore are effective, and sex plays a big enough part in the story, even though some viewers are going to be sorely disappointed with the lack of any Fox nudity. The brief lesbian coupling might make up for that to some degree, though.One good thing is that Seyfried is good enough to serve as an effective anchor for the film, while Fox seems to be having some fun with her antagonistic role. Adam Brody is amusing as self centered rock ""star"" Nikolai, and Johnny Simmons is quite likable as Needy's sensitive boyfriend Chip. Genre fans will be delighted to note the uncredited cameo by a familiar face right near the end.Ultimately, this is underwhelming but still basically watchable; it's not clear what the point of it all is, but it's got its moments.Six out of 10.",Jennifer's Body
15,poolandrews,Can't say I liked it.,3,31 March 2012,"Jennifer's Body is set in the small town of Devil's Kettle where a nerdy & socially inept high school student named Anita 'Needy' Lesnicki (Amanda Seyfried) has been best friends with the glamorous & popular cheerleader Jennifer Check (Megan Fox) since childhood. Jennifer ask's Needy to go to a local bar with her in order to see an indie band called Low Shoulder, during the performance the bar catches fire & several people are burned to death but both Jennifer & Needy manage to make it outside safely where Low Shoulder singer Nikolai (Adam Brody) offers to give Jennifer a lift in the band's van leaving Needy behind. As news of the tragic fire spreads through Devil's Kettle the town mourns, all that is except Jennifer who seems quite happy despite the events of the previous night. Then over the next few days two dead bodies are found, two bodies of male teens who were mutilated & partially eaten. Needy discovers that Jennifer was to be offered as a virgin sacrifice by Low Shoulder but since Jennifer wasn't a virgin the ceremony went wrong & Jennifer is now possessed by a demon who needs to eat human flesh...Directed by Karyn Kusama this black horror comedy was written by Cody Diablo supposedly back in 2006 who had previously wrote the screenplay for Juno (2007) which won her an Oscar, some of the same teenage themes are present as are the quirky dialogue & dark humour which her fans might like but I have to say that I didn't really like Jennifer's Body that much without totally hating it. The central relationship is a hard one to accept, Needy & Jennifer seemingly have nothing in common & quite why they are best friends I don't know. The script also feels like a teen melodrama like Dawson's Creek (1998) at times with it's middle class teen cast, high school problems, peer pressure, social status & fitting in crossed with a teen targeted version of The Exorcist (1973) with it's story about demon possession. It just felt a little awkward to me & I didn't like the feel or tone of the film that much, it tries to be funny & quirky without ever trying to be laugh out loud hilarious yet also tries to be sinister & scary without really ever going full blooded. The script also gives a very modern & mildly amusing reason for the initial virgin sacrifice as the indie Low Shoulder want success but bemoan the lack of opportunity for small indie bands & decide to get a helping hand from Satan in their quest for fame & fortune like the guy from Maroon 5. Available in both the original theatrical version & a director's cut released on home video I saw the longer 107 minute director's cut so my comments are based on that version which is apparently five minutes longer & has around seventy alterations & changes which are mostly brief, this 107 version drags a little in places & takes a while to get going but has a reasonable pace even if I wasn't exactly glued to the screen it did just about keep my interest.The look & sound of Jennifer's Body reeks of a low budget indie production, the soundtrack & it's constant use of indie songs in particular but also the somewhat quaint style in the way it's shot. The title Jennifer's Body apparently comes from the Courtney Love song of the same name. There's a brief & mild lesbian scene between Needy & Jennifer & Kusama direct's in a way to show off her star's sexuality, especially the ever awful Megan Fox who does look nice but offers little else in the role. There's a bit of gore, there's some blood splatter & Fox is seen eating from the inside of someone's ripped open stomach but generally Jennifer's Body isn't that graphic & certainly doesn't dwell or linger on the gore. The CGI computer effects are kept to a minimum & are well done.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 this flopped at the US box office & didn't even make back the fairly modest amount spent on it. Filmed mainly in British Columbia in Canada. Jennifer's Body is actually the first Megan Fox film I have seen & it's easy to see why she is universally disliked. Amanda Seyfried puts in a better performance while genre legend Lance Henriksen has a small cameo right at the end.Jennifer's Body wants to be lots of things, it wants to be a cool & quirky teen film, it wants to be a tense & scary horror film & a funny black comedy but never quite gets any aspect right & ends up leaving us wanting more.

Its a nasty and illogical little horror film about what happens to Jennifer after a night at a roadhouse turns deadly. Put me into the camp of those questioning Cody as the next big thing, oh wait I'm already there. I don't think the film works. I found it surprisingly dull. Its way too knowing, often artificial. The dialog doesn't have the snap of Juno when it hits the witty notes (Cody won the Oscar so comparisons are inevitable, though not really fair). A large portion of this is Cody's fault since she crafted the story, which didn't work for me (I don't think she understands what she's sending up), and the dialog which sound at times like a copy of Juno.You also have to blame it on the director who seems to be filming some other type of movie that has a boy eating demon running through it.

17,Bunuel1976,"JENNIFER'S BODY (Karyn Kusama, 2009) **1/2",6,13 March 2010,"I had watched – and felt less than enthusiastic about – the previous efforts by this film's director and screenwriter (both of whom are females): the dismal CGI-infested superhero dud AEON FLUX (2005; while attending that NYFA program in December 2005, I missed out on an opportunity to meet the director during a ""Q&A"" session following a screening...something I now regret!) and the insightful but overrated indie comedy JUNO (2007) respectively. This being a horror film of sorts I still wanted to have a look, and the fact that it starred the luscious Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried certainly could not have hurt its chances! The high-school setting draws obvious parallels with both CARRIE (1976) and GINGER SNAPS (2000) and the dialogue is predictably hip; equally expected was the over-reliance on contemporary songs on the soundtrack and, though there is quite a bit of violence, the end result is not particularly scary. Incidentally, the fact that Fox's character transpires to have been 'possessed' by a demon (the details of how this came to be is actually withheld till the last act!), the film-makers could not resist incorporating such trademark EXORCIST-type gimmicks as copious vomiting and levitation! Mind you, JENNIFER'S BODY is fairly entertaining and the two leads are both remarkably effective: since I had never watched Seyfried in anything, she emerges as a genuine revelation; on the other hand, I was obviously familiar with Fox's work from the two TRANSFORMERS pictures. Their lesbian sequence – which also links this, then, with the above-average ""Masters Of Horror"" episode SICK GIRL (2006) – proves genuinely titillating and easily the highlight of the film. Besides, it also makes use of a few clever attempts at cross-cutting: for instance, Seyfried losing her virginity at the same time that Fox is feasting on yet another victim. Again, the ending not only brings to mind that of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975) but even features an uncredited but welcome cameo appearance by Lance Henriksen as a night-time traveler picking up the hitch-hiking Seyfried.",Jennifer's Body
18,zardoz-13,One Hellvalot Fun!!!,10,20 September 2009,"Megan Fox takes top billing in ""Æon Flux"" director Karyn Kusama's evil girl horror comedy ""Jennifer's Body,"" an original, R-rated, feminist chiller about a lusty succubus and her vengeful adversary. Of course, ""Transformers"" babe Megan sheds not a stitch, but she chows down on dudes with an appetite. Although it lacks the onion layers of detail that characterized Diablo Cody's Oscar-winning ""Juno"" script, ""Jennifer's Body"" possesses a mischievous ""Heathers"" meets ""Carrie"" quality that transcends its blood and gore basics. Indeed, the dialogue bears the quintessential Cody quality. Meaning, it is self-conscious, flirtatious, and quotable, like nothing you'd expect in a standard issue scary movie. The characters aren't the usual ensemble of fish bait waiting to be munched by the bunch. ""Jennifer's Body"" never wears out its welcome and Kusama keeps it compelling, even when she is not trying to jolt up with a scare.Anita 'Needy' (Amanda Seyfried of ""Mamma Mia!"") and Jennifer (Megan Fox) have been best friends since they met in a sandbox. Indeed, they wear matching necklaces with heart-shaped pendants bearing the initials BFF in them. They attend the same high school in the small town of Devil's Kettle, Minnesota. The town takes its name from a local waterfall that apparently has no bottom. Scientists have been tossing everything known to mankind short of humans into the pool, but nothing has come back. Jennifer convinces Needy to ditch her drummer boyfriend, Chip (Johnny Simmons of ""The Spirit""), for the evening and accompany her to a honky-tonk called The Melody Lounge Tavern where a big city indie Goth band named 'Low Shoulder' is scheduled to perform. Chip warns them that the bar is a dive. Nothing, however, can distract Jennifer from sexy lead singer Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody of ""Grind"") and he reciprocates her interest. In fact, the whole band agrees that Nikolai has chosen well. During their performance, a fire erupts in the tavern and flames engulf everything. Several people perish, but Needy and Jennifer escape without a scratch. Right behind them with a drink in his hand appears Nikolai.Not surprisingly, Nikolai has mesmerized Jennifer and persuaded her to jump into his sinister van with his fellow musicians. Needy turns them down. The next time that Needy sees Jennifer, our hot chick protagonist stands drenched in blood and projectile vomits black goo all over Needy's linoleum kitchen floor. Needy describes it to Chip as ""roadkill and sewing needles mixed together.'' The next morning Needy sees Jennifer in class looking none the worse for wear. Before she was just a cheerleader, but now Jennifer has mutated into pure evil. Indeed, Jennifer lives to gobble up guys. Literally, she feasts off the flesh of teenage boys. She lives to kill and she doesn't care who she gets. Jennifer's lack of discrimination spells big trouble for her. Sometimes, she attracts an audience of woodland creatures who join in on the human buffet after she has stuffed herself.One of the high school teachers, Mr. Wroblewski (J.K. Simmons of ""Extract"") stumbles out into the woods behind the school and finds the star linebacker, Jonas Konelle (Josh Emerson of ""Comeback Season"") dead on his back. Jennifer has ripped Jonas' stomach wide open, and a ""Bambi"" type doe licks his innards. Eventually, Jennifer lets Needy in on her secret. The Goth band sacrificed her to Satan and carved her up. Nikolai and company thought Jennifer was a virgin, but she wasn't one. Now, she has come back as a demon with a need to feed. When she looks her best, Jennifer has been feeding. When she runs out of guys to eat, she looks horrible. She doesn't wear make-up and her hair loses its fluff. Eventually, Jennifer begins to eyeball Needy's boyfriend Chip so Needy ditches him at the spring high school formal. Needy and Jennifer part company as friends when the latter attacks Chip. This is about the time that things really start to happen, emphasizing the dominant theme of gals versus gals in a struggle between demonic titans.Basically, ""Jennifer's Body"" qualifies as a standard Dracula versus Van Helsing type yarn. No, vampires do not infest in this outstanding fright flick. A monster roams the land, feeding off defenseless mankind, specifically teenage guys, and a hero—heroine in this instance--must destroy it after acquiring the knowledge. Happily, this formulaic nail biter told in flashback mode springs a sufficient number of surprises. The action is narrated from Needy's perspective and her first line is: ""Hell is a teenage girl."" This film chronicles the friendship between Needy and Jennifer and their virtually psychic bond. For example, Needy has an uncanny way of knowing where Jennifer is and she can sometimes experience what Jennifer is doing. Director Kusama, who also directed ""Girlfight,"" splashes buckets of bloods all over ""Jennifer's Body,"" but she draws the line at gratuitous nudity, though a gratuitous lesbian make-out scene occurs over half-way through the pictures' 101 minutes.Sometimes the predictable occurs as it should, but sometimes Kusama and Cody pull a switcheroo. Primarily, Megan Fox has to look spectacular with lots of lip gloss, but Kusama never lets her starlet embarrass herself. Fox gets to play a round character in that the character undergoes change. She starts out as straight vampy cheerleader Jennifer and turns into demonic Jennifer. On the other hand, Seyfried and a strong supporting cast, including J.K. Simmons, as a teacher with a prosthetic arm, get a lot of mileage out of their contribution. The ending is terrific, too.",Jennifer's Body

I knew that the succubus in this horror was strictly eye candy and nothing else. So, no, I wasn't surprised that this movie was a flaming turd, I just thought I'd give it a chance.Jennifer (Megan Fox) was a super-tramp who spent every waking moment in a self-absorbed trance in which she fixated on sex and being sexy. Her slave of a best friend, appropriately named Needy (Amanda Seyfried), spent her days orbiting around the gravitational pull that was Jennifer's ego. The two had a weird symbiotic relationship that was part BFF and part obsession. At one point their fixation on one another turned into a steamy girl-on-girl make out scene sure to win the hearts and groins of many males.After Jennifer was used in a satanic ritual she was possessed by a demon that required human flesh to live. For whatever reason she only feasted on male flesh and always after seducing them. I guarantee neither was necessary (male-only flesh or the seduction), but then where would be the movie?""Jennifer's Body"" was 100 minutes of Megan Fox slinking around like a vamp with no filter vomiting up crude one-liners about sex and sexuality, and her pet of a friend chasing after her either to serve her or finally stop her. Along the way there were a couple of laughs whenever Jennifer stumbled upon a funny line or whenever J. K. Simmons was on screen.

Where Juno was a breath of fresh air, Jennifer's Body is a cheerfully trashy and utterly familiar high school teen horror with a dash of comedy thrown in.Megan Fox is, of course, the main attraction. She gets to say some raunchy dialogue and to tease the male element of the audience as much as some of her victims. But I haven't yet seen anything showing she can act - here she is required to pout, smoulder and be generally sultry and provocative, all things which come fairly naturally out of what she looks like. What she isn't required to do, however, is demonstrate any real acting ability. And I couldn't see a great deal of difference between her character before and after the demon took up residence in her.Amanda Seyfried has the meatier role, and attacks it with relish.The script is functional and, in places, fun.The horror element is satisfactory and the ending is not bad.The film overall is, of its kind, undemanding fun.",Jennifer's Body

Her Juno script was brilliant, and captured the real world of teen and family angst. Major disappointment here as the script was apparently written while Juno was chugging OJ.Sure, there are some nice moments that prevent this from being a total throwaway teen slasher, but certainly not enough to elevate it to the class of Carrie.Casting white hot celebrity of the moment, Megan Fox, was a wise move. That will be reason enough for some teenage boys to buy a ticket. Being much older and wiser, I found Amanda Seyfriend's character had much more potential and interest. Again, the letdown ... she really has very little to do except look confused, frightened, disgusted. Oh yes, and to plant one big wet kiss on Megan. Though it serves no real purpose to the film, it helped gather some necessary publicity.Adam Brody has a small, yet vital role, as the short-cut taking lead singer of an indie band looking to make a name for themselves. Kind of funny when you think about it, but not handled especially well.The last thing that bugs me about this is that neither Megan Fox nor Amanda Seyfried look like high school students - always a pet peeve of mine in a film about high schoolers.

Simmons, Amy Sedaris: Here is an interesting take on vampires that may remind viewers on the puberty reference in the werewolf film Ginger Snaps. Title regards infatuation as well as the male student body in which Jennifer feeds upon. She is a cheerleader who was a sacrifice to Satan by a struggling rock band. When she resurfaces she has vampire powers and feeds on the blood of males in order to retain her youth. Well written although third act is the standard face off. Directed by Karyn Kusama with ominous production visuals. Megan Fox is enchanting as Jennifer going from seductive cheerleader to vicious vampire. Amanda Seyfried plays her long time best friend who loses Jennifer at a concert only to have her resurface drenched in blood. She plays a great counterpart to Fox since both have very different backgrounds in film. We can expect a cat fight between the two as well as revenge on the cult band. Johnny Simmons plays Seyfried's boyfriend who becomes a target for Jennifer until Seyfried cuts in. Unfortunately this subplot ends on a sour note. Only J.K. Simmons as a professor is underused, which is unfortunate since he has been known as a scene stealer in past movies. Graphic and steamy horror entertainment recommended to vampire fans.

24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Far more enjoyable than it really should be,8,23 March 2015,"When her best friend begins acting totally different, a girl finds that she's been used by a rock band as a sacrifice for their success and is responsible for the blood-soaked rampage through town, forcing her to stop it.Frankly, this one became quite an enjoyable and entertaining creature feature. One of it's better elements is the rather fresh and original take on the possession angle which really does this one well. By using the possession to become a crazed flesh-eating demon with supernatural powers, there's a difference to this that causes a lot to like here in how she behaves to makes this a lot of fun. The ability to hover in the air, walk on the ceiling and utilize the lake as a regeneration tool are all pretty novel ideas and cause this one to feel pretty original at times. Likewise, that also extends to the rather fast and frenetic action along the way which really makes for an exciting and thrilling time here as this one tends to roll along at such an extended pace that it really gets a lot of its positives from this factor. The introductory scene to her condition, investigating noises in the darkened house with the phone call and then the discovery in the kitchen sets this one up nicely, and the rather frantic encounter within the flower shop makes this one incredibly exciting as the atmosphere of the location mixed with the suspense of the stalking along the rows of flowers comes together for a really enjoyable time. Other big action scenes from the opening accident at the concert along with the back-story explanation of everything and the final battle in the bedroom all creates a thoroughly entertaining amount of action in here, and along with the pleasingly graphic and bloody kills here makes this one's good qualities. There's a few minor ones in here that do bring this down, most notably the films' tendency to rely on hip-sounding lingo for the sake of attempting to be cool. There's numerous scenes of the two of them spouting off all sorts of hip lingo trying to be creative or original and comes off trying way too hard so it leaves the middle of the film really quite clumsy. Otherwise, the other flaw to this is the fact of it being a tease without being exploitative about it, tending to dance around the concept of her being a complete and utter sex-starved woman back back-tracking on really going full throttle on the whole problem, leaving it with dry sex-scenes and clumsily-edited scenes hiding these facets of the film. These manage to hold it down just enough, though.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, several sex scenes and frequent drug use.",Jennifer's Body

As bodies start piling up, Needy (Seyfried) and her beau (Johnny Simmons) try to solve the mystery.Fox is superb in the title role. She's undeniably foxy, but she's not my type. The same goes for the too-thin Seyfried, although Amanda certainly has a stunning face. While ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't as good as I expected it to be, it's good enough to marginally recommend if you like horror flicks in the high school/vampire vein. The tone is odd in that it tries to be serious while not taking itself too seriously.

28,trashgang,it's good enough to watch,6,20 April 2010,"Jennifer's body. So much is said about this movie before it came out, see all the interviews in those magazines and see how much Fangoria spend on it. Much was said when it finally came out and it wasn't that good and of course a lot was said about the body of Megan Fox. First of all, you know it's going to be a major release so mostly they aren't that gory like the independent or those on a smaller label. So I didn't know what to see and what to suspect. But hey, as a real geek in the genre this particular movie surprised me. First of all, I've seen the 15 add on it so I knew before that nudity and gore were left out of it. Still, I enjoyed the extended version. The storyline is great and indeed it was made for the youngest between us. It's good for a starter in the genre. It never is indeed gory but the blood flows and the acting is great, both Amanda Seyfrield and Megan Fox did a great job. And I agree, their should have been some nudity in it, the so called nudity shown is well, no nudity, you indeed see the shape of Megan's breasts and some part is shown and indeed you see her coming out of the water but only her back. But you had to known before that she wouldn't show anything. And see, that's what I am talking about and what everybody is talking about. But let me say, the hype of Twilight was bigger and that's just a piece of crap, isn't it. And I agree, some things you can see it coming like the fact that Megan is going for the lover of Amanda.

29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Jennifer's Body,5,1 November 2009,"Megan Fox has the noisy Transformers movies to thank for in propelling her to fan geekdom, where her Mikaela character had probably captured more attention amongst the fan boys who are just as ecstatic about catching some mindless, high-octane Michael Bay action, as they are trying to figure out what the bombshell has got to do with robots. Which is pretty little of course rather than to ramp up its sexy quotient, and to think that Fox herself would be more suited for a role such as this one, in which she plays a demonic cheerleader out to seduce and devour boys.But only if Diablo Cody's story wasn't that all over the shop. Successful with Juno in telling a story about a smart-mouthed teenager who finds herself pregnant, with Ellen Page and Michael Cera possessing some cute couple chemistry, Jennifer's Body turned out to be attempting to replicate that smarty dialogue, but felt so flat in the way her horridly inserted teen-vocabulary sounded each time they get uttered by It Girl of the town of Devil's Kettle, Fox's titular character Jennifer.While one would think it's second nature for Fox to be that figurative man-eater, in actual fact she fell quite flat besides smacking her lips most of the time, and trying to sound all sultry but coming off as quite artificial. What could have sent many a heart racing with its premise of luring bad boys with her nubile body, turned out to be nothing more than a very tame outing just to cater to teenage demographics. Instead, I was more in awe with effort of the make up artists in how they manage to camouflage Fox's rather prominent tattoos all over her body. Yes, I was that bored.The show however got stolen by Mama Mia's Amanda Seyfried as nerdy Needy (yes, what a name), Jennifer's childhood friend who's so thick with her that they share this almost psychic bond with each other, sensing their presence, danger and the likes. With those geeky specs and frayed, frizzy hair, Seyfried downright steals the show from under the nose of the vampish Fox, and her character possesses quite the spunk in getting at what she wants, like a crouching tiger who's just waiting for an opportunity to shine, which translated into the movie as getting angry off enough to dish out some punishment of their own.Cody's story clumsily explains the links between Jennifer's supernatural abilities with that of a county-wide disaster which claimed the lives of enough citizens to permeate a lot of doom and gloom in the air. A reason got offered of course for what this is all about, but everything else was really poor in having pile cliché and genre formula all over, with plenty of irrationality in the last act. If one would have thought this was the adventures of Jennifer, be warned that Needy is just as much interesting, or more so than Jennifer, thanks to Seyfriend's performance of how BFFs go from chummy, to an all out war.Fans of Megan Fox who are hoping to see a little more skin of their idol will likely leave the theatre unfortunately disappointed. The NC16 label has been put up, and the film surprising signals some toning down of requirements by the new local censors, where female to female lip locking would be under intense scrutiny, now it's just slapped with a rating just one above PG. A relaxation of rules perhaps?",Jennifer's Body
30,siderite,"Well acted, good story, missing something",8,26 November 2018,"This film is written by a woman and directed by another and its stars are female, too. And it shows. The perspective is female, the story is filled with metaphors of the female condition and the basic plot doesn't center so much on the murderous monster as on the affectionate relationship between the two girls. That makes the movie interesting and fresh, something to learn from. It makes the cast obviously care about the film as they make the extra effort. It's almost a shame that Fox accepted the role in Transformers next, after which no one would believe she could actually act. Watch this instead. Read between the lines, look at the carefully crafted scenes and you might understand why this film is a good movie.On the other hand, I believe the ferocious femaleness of the film also hurt it for male audiences. The marketing team was male and they pushed for Megan's beautiful face and the kiss between the two girls. No wonder guys got turned off by the plot in which males were nothing but a source of food with very few lines and shallow desires, while the girls stubbornly remain clothed all the time. The script almost ignores men and disregards them just as a regular movies disregard women in their roles. You make the same mistake, you get the same backlash; men are human, too, imagine that.My point is that while I loved the idea and the approach, I couldn't help feel that something was missing. It was the male perspective. Without it, the film is bland for men watchers. Would it have hurt to make the men in the film act more, be more relatable, behave more like human beings? Show Megan's body more as a man watches her and you do not objectivize the girl, but show how the guy sees the world. Whenever you skirt characterization, the story loses, and this was the case with Jennifer's Body.

32,JamesHitchcock,Make sure your chosen victim really is virgo intacta,5,20 February 2016,"In ""Jennifer's Body"" Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried play ""Best Friends Forever"" who, we are told, have absolutely nothing in common. I know what you're thinking. Surely Megan and Amanda have one thing in common- they're both absolutely gorgeous. But not in this film. Admittedly, Megan's character Jennifer is gorgeous, but Amanda is supposed to be plain, dowdy and nerdish. As if! The Best Friends Forever are the beautiful Jennifer Check and the plain, dowdy and nerdish Anita Lesnicki, classmates at a high school near Devil's Kettle, Minnesota. Anita is generally known by the nickname ""Needy""; this might just about be phonetically plausible, given that most Americans would pronounce ""Anita"" as ""Aneeda"", but the name was obviously chosen to reflect Anita's personality. (She is ""needy"" in the American sense of ""emotionally demanding"", not the British one of ""financially impoverished""). One night the two girls are attending a concert given by a rock group in a local bar when fire breaks out and several people are killed. Both girls escape unharmed, but immediately afterwards Jennifer disappears with the members of the band, who have also escaped. Soon afterwards, Needy realises that her friend's personality has changed, and not for the better. Even before the fire, Jennifer could be spoilt, selfish and bitchy, but now she's positively evil. That's not evil as in ""stealing other girls' boyfriends"". That's evil as in ""murdering boys in order to drink their blood"". Needy also realises that she is the only one who can bring Jennifer's reign of terror to an end, preferably before Needy's own boyfriend Chip becomes the next victim. The exact reason behind Jennifer's personality change would be too complicated, as well as too absurd, to set out here, but it is connected to two interesting facts we learn in the course of the film:-1.It is hard to succeed in the indie rock world these days unless you sell your soul to the Devil. Literally. 2. If you ever need to sacrifice a virgin to Satan, it pays to make sure your chosen victim really is virgo intacta. Trying to sacrifice a non-virgin can have all sorts of unfortunate consequences. The film relies on a lot of the standard high schools movie stereotypes; the students, for example, seem to be divided into four categories- attractive but spoilt and arrogant girls like Jennifer, equally arrogant but stupid ""jocks"" (inevitably male- no American teenage girl, apparently, ever takes an interest in sport except as a cheerleader), bespectacled, nerdish academics (of both sexes) and moody, emotional Goths (ditto). It does however occasionally depart from the standard clichés; Jennifer, for example, may be a cheerleader but is not dating any of the football team. (Or anyone else for that matter; she is too much of a slut to have a steady boyfriend). And she is never described as ""most popular girl in the school""- the scriptwriter Diablo Cody (what an appropriate forename for the writer of a horror film) clearly realised that spoilt, arrogant girls, however attractive they may be, are seldom popular with their peers. Cody and director Karyn Kusama seem to have had high ambitions to make a feminist horror film. Cody, noting that many previous horror films had featured female characters mainly as the screaming victims of evil males, said she wanted the film to ""speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends"". I am not sure about ""female empowerment""; there is a big difference between ""being empowered"" and ""slaughtering people"", and the idea of the beautiful woman as bloodsucking succubus has less to do with feminism than with some ugly male prejudices about female sexuality. As for ""complex relationships between best friends"", Cody's idea of ""complexity"" is to have some fairly obvious lesbian subtext spill over in one scene into full-blown lesbian text. Well, at least that should keep the lads-mag brigade happy. (This was one of two films from 2009, the other being ""Chloe"", in which Amanda Seyfried played a bisexual character). The film was obviously influenced by ""Heathers"" from 1988 (possibly the best satirical high-school comedy), but lacks that film's depth and satirical bite. Despite the gap between the film-makers' expressed intentions and their actual achievement, ""Jennifer's Body"" is not altogether a bad movie. As I said, the plot of is absurd beyond words, but then it is meant to be a black comedy, and supernatural horror high school black comedies are not a film genre known for strict realism or plausibility.. Both the leading actresses, especially the lovely Megan, throw themselves into their roles with enthusiasm, and there is some sharp dialogue, even some social comment about the modern tendency to sentimentalise tragedies and the way in which the rock band are able to bask in some wholly undeserved praise for their supposed heroism on the night of the fire.

No, not like that, you dirty mind!",6,21 September 2009,"Megan Fox, this girl is getting a ton of attention, mainly because Transformers got the hot girl who knew everything about cars and now she's the fantasy of every guy. I think a lot of guys are going to this movie expecting to see a naked Megan Fox, but sorry to disappoint, it doesn't happen, but I'm sure there's a kissing scene that will get your rocks off. As for the movie Jennifer's Body, I know there are going to be quite a bit of haters for this movie, but honestly I enjoyed it. Written by Diablo Cody who wrote Juno there's a lot of question on wither dialog is realistic and honestly I think it is. My school had a lot of cliques who talked like she writes. Jennifer's Body is no exception, this is a strange movie but is great in the fact that we finally get a good female horror movie. Who knew Megan Fox could pull in a scary performance? Her and Amanda Seyfried had some great chemistry and made the film work. While the script needs a little improvement, it's still a lot of fun to watch.Nerdy, reserved bookworm Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicki and arrogant, conceited flag girl Jennifer Check have been best friends ""since the sandbox"", although they share little in common. One night, Jennifer drags Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by indie rock band Low Shoulder, with eyes on its blithely evil lead singer, Nikolai Wolf. A disastrous fire destroys the bar, and Jennifer ends up leaving the bar with the band, who take her into the woods, where she learns that the band is worshiping Satan, and that Wolf intends to use her as a virgin sacrifice in order to gain fame. However, as Jennifer was not a virgin, the demon spirit takes over her body. Later that evening, Jennifer appears at Needy's house, covered in blood, looking vacant, and vomits black fluid. The following morning, Jennifer appears fine, and Needy slowly deduces that Jennifer is eating the bodies of boys to survive. As Needy's male classmates are steadily killed off in gruesome attacks, the young girl must uncover the truth behind her friend's transformation and find a way to stop the bloodthirsty rampage before it reaches her own boyfriend Chip.One of the things I do wish Diablo explored was Jennifer's character a little more, just to give the audience a little insight, knowing that this gorgeous girl has insecurities. A lot of girls in high school are like Jennifer, except for the eating boys part, they think they're a gift to the school they attend because they're so gorgeous, but they try to control things around them because they will feel insecure otherwise. The film is a little shaky on some comedic elements, but the scene where Adam Brody is sacrificing Megan to Satan and just the way he's reacting to the whole ceremony, reading directions he got off the internet was killing me in laughter. The ending was terrific, I won't give it away. But for me one of the most memorable scenes was when Needy sees Jennifer covered in blood and Megan slowly smiles with blood dripping out of her mouth, scared me half to death. The movie could have been a little more, but I had a good time watching it. I think over all it was fun, it'll be forgotten, it's not a classic, but it's good for a scare and a laugh.6/10",Jennifer's Body
34,thesar-2,Megan's Body is the only reason this was made,1,16 May 2010,"Honestly, I don't want to spend too much time on this incredible piece of crap. Sure, I've heard it was terrible, it made all-but zero at the box-office and Megan Fox can't act. Blah, blah, I will enjoy or dislike a movie despite the popular opinion. But, now I am the spokesperson against Jennifer's Body. (As well as Megan Fox's.) How do you know the movie you're making during production is a turd? And if you step back, watch some footage and say, ""Uh, guys, hold on a second. WTF is this?"" do you simply give up and shut down the set while apologizing to the crew and reminding them your decision will help all mankind? In this case, they didn't shut down production, but you can sure as hell tell they gave up half way through production, if they made it that far. The rancid subplots or main plot, if there was one, just kind of dies somewhere in the first half and never recovers.The result of their inability to cut their losses is a film that exploits all that is evil about badly made films: Horrible editing, inconsistent and incoherent plot, bad special effects – oooohhhh, she flooooooats using the high school drama team's wires, disgusting acting and worse dialogue, laugh-out-loud revolutions and plot holes to fit both Fox's and writer Diablo Cody's ego. (Yeah, that big.) Let's see if I can actually come up with a synopsis for this. Mind you, it's been a few hours since I've seen it and I fell asleep half way through. Unfortunately when I awoke, I had to finish it.Here goes: Jennifer (Fox) and best girlfriend (literally, in one scene,) the appropriately named ""Needy"" (Seyfried) are inseparable until they go to a tavern that has a band playing and the place burns down. In one of the movie's most outrageous WTF? moments, and believe me there's dozens where my eyes widened, Jennifer simply goes with the band in their van as the place is blazing and people are dying. We're supposed to assume they're going to (after) party as most people do when burning bodies drop like flies around them.All's not well with the students at Hell High, including Needy's brush with Jennifer as she spews black goo and is covered in blood the night before. But, in another WTF? moment, the clock ticks past 5 minutes and everyone's back to normal.Eventually, Needy's on to Jennifer's sudden change and the body count rises. She knows and does nothing. We know and we don't have the power to do anything but turn off the movie. In my defense, I fell asleep, and thought I was refreshed enough to tackle the finale.As not to give too much of a spoiler, there's reasons, completely insane, but nevertheless motivations on why Jennifer's so, well, perky following the student's deaths, but suffice to say, don't even bother getting that far. If this was Netflix'ed, and you open the envelope to discover this inside, simply slide it back in, seal it and apologize to your mailperson that he/she has to waste time returning it.I actually found one positive in the film (and this is a definite spoiler): The finale's set up to have yet another huge bloodbath high school dance, a la Carrie or the more recent, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever , yet it didn't come to pass. I'm guessing it was another problem they had in the storyboard room or for budgetary issues. Either way, I'm actually pleased, though not enough to raise the rating I give but ½ a star, that they didn't go to the obvious. That said, it did make the dance scene irrelevant, boring and annoying. It should have been cut. In conjunction with this spoiler, there are so many unanswered questions for people who have seen this lazy crap.(More spoilers) Why did she only attack/eat boys? How exactly will killing someone, sacrificing them and introducing a demon into a town with the name ""Devil"" (yeah, the movie sinks that low) in it produce better record sales? Why did an actor I love watching, EXCEPT THIS TIME, J. K. Simmons have a claw for a hand? Why would the bad band members who had books and witchcraft props all over their van act like they didn't know how to conjure up a demon and relied on the internet?Okay, I have given too much away, and inadvertently gave the reason behind the demon that is Jennifer('s Body). I've also spent too much time. Skip this. Seriously, it is as bad as they say it is. Megan Fox now stars in three of my least favorite movies: Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and this one. She's still young and extremely beautiful enough to get, no, demand a better script.",Jennifer's Body

36,bowmanblue,As if the teenage years weren't stressful enough,8,19 January 2021,"I remember when I first watched 2009's 'Jennifer's Body.' I thought it was great. It was only when I looked online that I realised it had been a bit of a flop at the Box Office and was taking a critical mauling from the critics. Now, over ten years later, I've given it another watch... and I still love it!It's a horror movie. Don't be lulled into any marketing (whether official or fans' interpretations) that states that it's some sort of deep and meaningful critique of youth or femininity. It's pretty much a horror movie. And, in my opinion, all good horror movies are either great because they're genuinely scary, or brilliant fun because they don't take themselves too seriously. 'Jennifer's Body' definitely falls into the latter category.Without going into too much detail, a teenage girl (Megan Fox) gets possessed by an evil demon and begins to crave more than just a couple of tubs of chocolate ice cream while watching 'The Notebook' on a Friday night, i.e. human flesh. Only her best friend (Amanda Seyfried) knows the truth and sets about doing her best to stop her murderous ways.Yes, there's some gore, but it's nothing you haven't really seen before. It's the script that's what makes the film great fun (and I hear it's even finally found a bit of a cult following today). Like I say, it doesn't take itself too seriously and there's plenty of banter between the cast and it's like they know that what they're doing - kind of - sends up the genre. Not only does Fox and Seyfried carry the film, there's a great supporting cast to look out for, including Chris Pratt, Lance Henrikson and J.K. Simmons.Don't go into this film expecting anything deep and meaningful, just enjoy a bit of a gory satire on the horror genre and modern teenage life in general.",Jennifer's Body
37,MLDinTN,tongue in cheek humor,6,27 July 2010,"This movie was OK, I'm sure a lot of teen boys liked it since it's all about Megan Fox's body. Jennifer, played by Fox, and her best friend ( the sort of nerdy Needy) go to a bar to see a band. Well this band is evil and they take Jennifer. Needy goes home and Jennifer shows up all covered in blood and vomiting black liquid. Needy's not sure what's wrong but the next day at school, Jennifer is as glam as ever. A couple of high schoolers are killed and finally Jennifer tells Needy what happened when the band took her. So the final is Needy trying to save her boyfriend from Jennifer.This movie was sort of written as a dark comedy. And I think Megan was good as the sexy twisted teen. One problem was most of the gore was off screen or if shown only for a second.FINAL VERDICT: Great for those into teen slasher type films.",Jennifer's Body

39,paulclaassen,"Not bad, not excellent.",5,4 April 2020,"Uhm, I have mixed feelings about this one. It reminded me of 'The Babysitter' (2017) I saw a while back. 'Jennifer's Body' was made back in 2009, though. There's no doubt the film is stunningly photographed, which helped in making the film more enjoyable.One should respect the film for not being cliched. One is also never really sure whether Jennifer (Megan Fox) is actually a demon or a vampire, as she owns traits of both entities, but that's what makes it unique, I suppose. Although this is a horror comedy, I found the comedy element getting in the way of suspense more often than not. Even the most scary scenes are not effective as it should be, due to the constant humor. There are a few truly creepy moments scattered throughout the film.The visual effects and make-up are very good. I didn't find the acting all that convincing - once again due to the comical element. In general, though, it wasn't a bad watch. It won't exactly go down as a classic (for me) but it was watchable. I'd much rather watch 'The Babysitter', though.Would I watch it again? No. Not a comedy fan and the humor is too much, and not funny enough.",Jennifer's Body
40,filipemanuelneto,An unfortunate attempt to make sexual terror.,3,30 November 2016,"This movie is the typical light and highly sexualized horror movie that sells well among teenagers. It revolves around a young intellectual girl, Needy, and his friend, the futile and naughty Jennifer, a cheerleader who turns into a succubus after being used by a garage band in a Satanist ritual that required a young virgin to work well. The transformation results from the simple fact that Jennifer's virginity was already part of the past. From then on, Jennifer will entertain herself to kill and eat young males who seek to have sex with her.Megan Fox is the main actress of the cast and plays the lead role. But she's not a good actress. Having a beautiful face and a sexy body is not enough to be an actress, there has to be talent. It's not the case. Basically, what Megan Fox does in this movie is show her body and seduce the audience. But this is not erotic cinema, is it? Amanda Seyfried looks better and works relatively well in Needy's role.Basically the film is just the traditional and overused recipe of sex and terror. Most of the special effects, visual and sound are quite rudimentary and make use of the usual clichés in the films of this horror sub-genre. The scares are few and mediocre. There is enough blood for gore fans, but we cannot properly say that the movie is a bath of flesh, blood and guts. There are many moments in the movie where sex is suggested, but even this is conventional and serves only to hold the teens to the end. There are still some attempts to make jokes, but they are so bad that it's not even worth talking about.",Jennifer's Body

43,insomniac_rod,Return to High School Horror!,8,18 February 2010,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this movie! Anyways.To be completely honest with you, I enjoyed ""Jennifer's Body"" for the next reasons:1) The Horror-Comedy entertainment in fast track, fast-food style. 2) It made me remember about the era when Horror Movies from the 80's were placed in junior or high school with plots such like ""Trick Or Treat"", ""Deadly Friend"", or even ""Fright Night"". I even consider this movie to be very similar to ""Prom Night III: The Last Kiss"". That's just me... Heck, even the posters look very similar. 3) It has everything to become a cult classic because of it's dialogs and plot.The plot is dynamic and it presents killings and gore very soon. Sure, always accompanied by a common bad habit in modern Horror: CGI. But which movie doesn't use it?I had doubts before watching the movie mainly because it's writer, Diablo Cody was the responsible for creating ""Juno"", a movie that generated plenty of controversy and gained plenty of hype to the point to be considered overrated and tendentious.Anyways, the script/plot is nothing new but it joins two very attractive topics that were extremely popular in the 80's: 1) Vampirism and Cannibalism; but this time it's a sexy succubus. 2) Hard Rock-Metal bands that worship the devil.All those elements land in a high school atmosphere, a situation that isn't bad at all if you take in consideration that the movie is oriented for young adults or teens.Let's keep in mind that this PG-13 movie invasion has had good exceptions like ""Drag Me To Hell""; and in the case of ""Jennifer's Body""; I truly believe it's a worthy option because it adds somehow originality to the genre.I think that the events are treated adequately in order to maintain a ""cool"" feeling through the running time for the audience thus making ""click"" with the characters. This is made through good acting from Amanda Seyfried who completely believes in her character and demonstrates her versatility as an actress. The good news is that Megan Fox's acting isn't painful. Heck, she even delivers signals that she could become a ""decent"" actress. Megan's role was perfect for her because she could exploit her obvious sensuality and sexuality and her ""role model"" image for young people. The chemistry between Seyfriend and Fox is really good and it's displayed in all the scenes they share. Even in the kinky and passionate kiss that rose the theater's temperature.We got memorable scenes like Jennifer walking in slow motion wearing tight jeans and a pink shirt. Or Jenn wearing the skimpy cheerleader miniskirt, the tough guy's split corpse, the fire in the bar, some junior high students singing the ""In"" song, Needy walking with a good attitude in the ending, the last fight between the two leads, the death scenes, etc.The negativity of the movie deals with the high expectations towards it created by the poster where it sells Megan's body. Some dialogs that try to be ""cool"", the now popular vampiric plot (this could be considered as ""Twilight"" for men!), and the not so good CGI.The Direction is pretty good and I enjoyed the contrast between some colorful atmosphere (school, bedrooms, the band playing, flashbacks) and the night sequences (dirty pool, woods, mist). A very good cinematography and art direction. I like the movie's look. The soundtrack was good and I even noticed myself moving my foot following the rhyming of some songs!. It's catchy, rock from the new millennium, but it works for the movie's tone. Gore is just decent although we don't get that much blood; we get a cool vampiric creature spitting insects and black blood, stabbings, harsh beatings, and more (Megan's demise).The vampiric-cannibalistic action is tremendously entertaining. The dialogs are pure trash but highly entertaining trash. Through some dialogs I realized that I'm getting old and I barely understood some in-jokes such as a thing with Hannah Montana, PMS, insults like Monistat, Vagisil, etc. It reminded me of my good days in late 80's Horror. The Horror-Comedy aspect is very well handled and delivers some smiles of irreverent. The same goes for the black humor which is the element that saved the movie from being...let's just say, another one from the pile.You should definitely check out ""Jennifer's Body"" in order to get some nostalgia feelings that deal with Highschool Horror which was often used in the 80's. Sure, not adapted to the needs of a consumerist society filled with clichés...you'll understand why. I have the slight impression that we will have many, many movies like ""Jennifer's Body"" in the future. Not a bad thing.",Jennifer's Body

She is possessed when a band sacrifice her to demon so they can become rich and famous. The problem is, she was meant to be a virgin, and she wasn't, so the spell didn't go as planned.

46,GOWBTW,TOO subtle!,7,18 August 2018,"There are horror films that are bold and in your face. And there's ""Jennifer's Body"". This movie is downright odd. There plenty of blood, violence, and language. Great star power like Megan Fox, the hottie who plays Jennifer. Amanda Seyfried, the hottie who plays ""Needy"" who is not very hot. Amy Sedaris, well-known for ""Strangers With Candy"" plays Needy's mother. J.K. Simmons plays the teacher. And Johnny Simmons who plays Chip, Needy's boyfriend. 
The town is quiet and uneventful. Until one night, a fire breaks out at a tavern killing some people. While the town mourns the people who went to the school, another tragedy rocks the town. Instead of a fire, it was a murder of the football captain. The suspect of the murders is Jennifer. Normally, she looks incapable of such acts. However, she became more dangerous after her encounter with a band she has been following. She was a victim of a ritual that makes her into a succubus, a demon that feeds on human flesh. 
This movie is like more sexual than horror. Too many puns and slapsticks, not enough horror to make it exciting.

47,dee.reid,"""Jennifer's Body,"" Megan's movie",9,18 September 2009,"Going into ""Jennifer's Body,"" chances are you already know whether or not you're going to like it. But the real test of mettle should not be whether or not you think the movie will be any good. The question is whether or not you like its star, ""Transformers"" Megan Fox, in her first leading role, as a high school queen bee turned soul-sucking succubus, and the attempts of her best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried) to try to stop her bloody rampage.""Jennifer's Body"" was directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody (of 2007's ""Juno"") and as per usual, her script is chock-full of pop culture references with everything from Tampax, to Vagisil, to Bowflex, to Hannah Montana; there's also some assorted references to the early ""B""-movie horror of John Carpenter, the ""Scream""-era camp and sarcasm, ""Heathers""-esque attitude, and a slight subtext promoting the power of vengeance-seeking young women over under-sexed young men. And believe me, some of Cody's witticisms are worth a few vague laughs, as well as blood-curdling shocks. Lastly, of course, Megan Fox looks hella-sexy (which is what she is really best at), as the vamp-tramp of the film's title.Just for the record, though, I think Megan Fox is actually one of Hollywood's least - least is italicized - attractive young actresses of the moment. To my ungrateful eyes, while she may have all right moves as a bona-fide sex pot, I just can't escape the feeling that she looks like a hooker and parades around Hollywood as such. And she has a big mouth, a very big mouth, and she's not afraid to use it; many of her most famous quotes are just too good to be reprinted here - just go to any Hollywood gossip site for further details. That is of course, no excuse for not liking this movie, for which Fox is actually quite good in her first starring role, where she is still pretty much playing herself, a hot-to-trot sex-bomb.As the titular character, Jennifer Check, Fox does not disappoint in delivering a performance that is not by any means spectacular, or even really bad, but succeeds for all the right reasons because it utilizes Fox's key assets, namely her big mouth, her much-fabled sexiness, her much-talked-about bi-sexuality and, hum, of course, her ASSETS (italicized). In a small Midwestern town called Devil's Kettle, Jennifer Check seems to have all the boys at her school drooling over her, and her best friend, the blonde, bookish Needy (think closely about that name for a second) follows her around everywhere she goes.Everything changes one night when Jennifer and Needy, looking to score with the lead singer of an up-and-coming Emo band named Low Shoulder, Jennifer finds herself whisked away in their van off to some place in the middle of the woods. Before you know it, Jennifer shows up the next day at school with an insatiable appetite for the flesh of her many young suitors, and she's going to get what she wants by any means necessary. And so it's up to Needy to find a way to stop her before too many more young men end up biting the dust.""Jennifer's Body"" is perhaps another entry into what I can only guess will be an attempt by Hollywood to bring back the good old days of campy ""B""-movie horror. We already had that with the utterly fantastic ""Drag Me to Hell"" earlier this year, so ""Jennifer's Body"" could be attempt number-two. The movie works, even if it didn't quite meet ALL my expectations and seems a bit inconsistent in mixing the elements of comedy, horror, and satire. Surprisingly, Fox isn't on-screen that much, nor does she really show that much skin; the film belongs more or less to her co-star, Amanda Seyfried (is it HER - italicized - career that this movie just made instead?). I know I probably just lost half my readership by saying that, but either way, Fox's male fans won't be too - italicized - disappointed in seeing their girl's sexiness flashed all over the screen in a gratuitous fashion, which includes a far-away shot of her skinny dipping in a lake, and of course there is that much-talked-about make-out scene between her and Amanda Seyfried.I don't care much for Megan Fox, but I can only say that she wasn't bad in her first starring role, because it plays well on her two main strengths: looking sexy and saying her lines like a crazy porn star. So all in all, she was made for this role. Who knows? Maybe she'll make an appearance in ""Jennifer's Body II,"" or something close to that.9/10",Jennifer's Body

49,kevin_robbins,This falls way short of its potential and is disappointing,4,24 September 2021,"Jennifer's Body (2009) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime and is also available on Tubi. The storyline follows a pair of best friends since they were little girls and are now the object of boys attention in high school. One night while at a concert Jennifer, ie one of the friends, spends some time with the band and when she returns home she's completely different and the best friends aren't so friendly to each other any more. What happened to Jennifer that night and what is her new obsession? This movie is directed by Karyn Kusama (Aeon Flux) and stars Megan Fox (Transformers), Amanda Seyfried (Mean Girls), Adam Brody (Ready or Not), Johnny Simmons (Scott Pilgrim vs the World), J. K. Simmons (Juno) and Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy). The dialgue and chemistry between Fox and Seyfriend is actually pretty good throughout the movie. The acting by the entire cast fits the characters to perfection. I also really liked the beginning of this movie through the concert sequence to set the movie up and then when Fox returns to Seyfriend changed. The movie had hope until right there. Then the CGI gets really weird to show the transformation and we never see enough of ""Jennifer's Body."" The kill scenes have way too much CGI followed by cut away and the CGI was too cartoonish...like watching a Resident Evil cutaway. The storyline itself did have potential and could have been a horror version of Mean Girls but falls flat. I will say the soundtrack isn't bad. Overall this falls way short of its potential and is disappointing. I'd score this a 4/10.",Jennifer's Body
50,MBunge,Cody should have given her kingdom for a coherent metaphor,4,22 June 2012,"While it's easy to see where and how a movie goes wrong, it's often hard to understand why. Despite appearances, the film industry is full of relatively talented people who are reasonably good at what they do. Most of us are able to pretty consistently be at least mediocre at our jobs. So, why is that bar frequently too high for cinema folk? For Jennifer's Body, the answer is quite clear. Writer Diablo Cody tried to pull off a Buffy the Vampire Slayer metaphor with Jennifer's Body. With Buffy, Joss Whedon came up with ""high school is hell"". With this script, Cody came up with ""hell is a high school girl"". But while Whedon and company fully understood what their metaphor meant and how it would be reflected by their stories, Cody never really nailed down what ""hell is a high school girl"" was supposed to mean. Her metaphor is unformed and undefined and Cody's story is plastered with a bunch of different possible meanings, but without any focus or structure. Lacking that unifying vision, Jennifer's Body lurches from one emotionally and thematically disconnected scene to another, never amounting to anything.I don't want to be too negative. Cody does come up with some great lines, though far too many fall flat for lack of any support from the plot. Amanda Seyfried is very talented and, weirdly, so is Megan Fox. Weirdly because there's this thing with Fox where you don't think she can act. When you pay attention to her performances, though, she really can. There's also more than a bit of intelligent satire and other social commentary on display here. At the very least, Jennifer's Body is more clever than your run of the mill horror flick. Without a point to serve, however, clever will just wander off into the woods and die of exposure.""Needy"" (Amanda Seyfried) is the dorky girl with the childhood best friend who grew up to be a super hot cheerleader, Jennifer (Megan Fox). ""Needy"" has a boyfriend (Johnny Simmons) but her world truly revolves around the catty, narcissistic Jennifer. After a tragedy in their hometown, Jennifer becomes possessed by a demon and starts chowing down on some high school boys. ""Needy"" eventually figures that out and has to stop Jennifer from making a meal out of her boyfriend.Let me give you an example of what I mean by the unfocused metaphor of this movie. There are two moments that suggest a potential meaning for ""hell is a high school girl"". When Jennifer feeds on flesh, she becomes supercharged with beauty and vitality. When she gets hungry, she loses her physical luster. Well, there's a scene where we see a hungry Jennifer putting on heavy makeup to conceal her sallow look and there's sad resignation in her eyes about what she's going to have to do to look good again. Later on, there a line where ""Needy"" talks about how Jennifer was no longer socially relevant before all this demon stuff started. Those two things together pose an interesting possibility. What if ""hell is a high school girl"" was about the brutal social environment young women live in, the terrible extremes they go through to survive it and the price those extremes demand from them and inflicts on the people around them? I think that's a promising premise. Unfortunately, nothing else in Jennifer's Body aligns with or supports that interpretation of the metaphor. I lost count, but I think there's 5 or 6 other possible takes on ""hell is a high school girl"" rattling around inside this film and none of them fit with any of the others. The result is that even when something in the story works, it doesn't connect or lead to anything else.Cody is a good enough writer with a good enough cast and good enough direction from Karyn Kusama that there's still some stuff to like, but the overall experience of Jennifer's Body is disappointing. I'd have to give a very mild recommendation to skip it.",Jennifer's Body
51,sauravjoshi85,"Partly Horror, partly comic, partly entertaining",4,6 May 2021,"Jennifer's Body is a comedy horror movie directed by Karyn Kusama and stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons and Adam Brody.Jennifer turns into a succubus and start killing her male classmates and wanted to kill the boyfriend of her Best friend.First of all I would like to have two minutes silence for all those minds who had given the movie a 'cult' status, I mean this movie is entertaining in pieces but doesn't deserved to be called as cult movie.The plot of the movie is interesting and execution is decent, the movie is partly horror and partly comic, the screenplay of the movie is also decent but nothing great, the movie is undoubtedly gore and has lots of blood still the horror element is missing.Acting was great and both the female leads were just amazing with I would like to slightly tilt towards Megan Fox as she looked more natural and realistic. All the other characters were average to decent.The climax of the movie is probably the strongest part of the movie. The movie is not that horrifying as it seems and apart from few nice one liners this movie seriously misses good comedy also, this movie can be termed as entry level horror movie but good acting and some decent funny scenes, can be watched once.",Jennifer's Body
52,drownnnsoda,Modern Teenage Culture Transported to a 1980s High School Horror Movie.,8,18 September 2009,"""Jennifer's Body"" focuses on the small town of Devil's Kettle (funny name, huh?), where Jennifer Check (Megan Fox) and Needy Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried) live and attend the local high school. Jennifer is the sassiest and most longed-for girl in the school; she's promiscuous, witty, and isn't even a ""back-door virgin"", as she puts it. Needy is a foil of Jennifer; she's a bit quirky, dons thick-rimmed glasses, and enjoys the creative fiction curriculum classes offered by the school. While the two are opposites, there is a catch - they have been best friends since they were young children- a ""sandbox"" friendship, as Needy puts it. One evening while frequenting a local lounge so Jennifer can ""stalk"" the lead singer of a popular punk band (played by Adam Brody), the place catches fire and half those attending the concert die in the flames. Jennifer, however, who is in a daze, is taken away with the band members after she and Needy escape the fire; and she is never quite the same again. Soon local high school boys begin dying one by one, cannibalized and eviscerated, and it seems that Jennifer has got something to do with it.I had been excited for this film ever since I saw the trailers online, and I was pleased with what I received as an audience member. Diablo Cody, who wrote the critically acclaimed and incredibly popular ""Juno"" returns to the screen with this film, which, while quite different from her previous film, retains some of the snarky teenage dialogue that was so prominent in ""Juno"". Difference is, this is a horror film; well, sort of. It's almost more of a comedy, but manages to be a potent mixture of both genres. In terms of plot, there's not a lot to it. It follows archetypes, but is conscious of this, which therefore allows the film to wallow around in its own self consciousness. It's campy, has a sort of retro edge to it, and doesn't take itself seriously, yet it has the freedom to do so. A summary of the film's plot will tell the audience everything they need to know and expect, and the film delivers on this note; you have to remember that the filmmakers weren't trying to make something raw and realistic. ""Jennifer's Body"" is total camp horror.Aside from the plot, the script mixes a little bit of both comedy and horror to keep fans of both genres pleased. There is just enough violence and classic horror set-ups to keep you in the mind frame of a horror movie; and there is a heaping handful of vulgar-but-hilarious dialogue and comical character histrionics to keep you laughing consistently throughout the film. As some have criticized of Cody's writing, she does use a lot of sassy one-liners and ""hipster talk"", but I frankly thought that the majority of what was said in the film was effective. I laughed quite a bit at some of the things that came out of these characters' mouths; and not just words - that includes the needly black vomit that Jennifer expels all over Needy's kitchen floor.The style of the film is what I probably liked the most about it. It managed to take today's pop culture and displace it in the setting of a 1980s horror movie, which is a novel idea, and one that works wonderfully. There are references galore to culture of today as well as to times passed; old-school horror fans will be happy to notice the slight references to 1980s horror flicks, such as an ""Evil Dead"" poster that can be spotted on Needy's bedroom wall, which I thought was great. Mentions of Phil Collins land side-by-side with references to modern teen fantasy films like ""Aquamarine"" and high schoolers crediting Wikipedia as a reliable news resource; it's hilarious actually, and the way these things are written is really clever. The filmmakers seem to know the audience that enjoy these type of films, they are aware of the genre's history, and they know how to communicate this effectively. The characters themselves are funny to begin with. Megan Fox brings the classic evil beauty queen to life, and her acting is surprisingly good. Sure, in context of the film, the things she says and does may seem ridiculous, but she owns the role. Amanda Seyfried is equally good in the cliché good-girl role, and she's proved her talent before with her bubbly role in ""Mean Girls"", as well as her work on HBO's ""Big Love""; she's cute and lovable and the audience is able to sympathize with her, and yet she can be a smart ass herself. I like that. The supporting cast, including Adam Brody as a Satanic rock singer, are all very solid.The film's ending is typical, although there were a couple darker twists to things that I didn't necessarily expect. All in all, though, the film is a solid one. It takes elements from '80s camp classics like ""Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night 2"", and throws them into the confines of modernity, along the lines of something like Wes Craven's ""Scream"" films, and amps up the comic side of it all. It's extremely corny but the events are still understandable, the characters are quirky while their dialogue is sardonically delicious, and the film as a whole is aware of its extremeness on all levels; nonetheless, the formula here works.Overall, ""Jennifer's Body"" is a film of a rare breed. If you are a fan of 1980s high school-set horror flicks, then this film will be a great throwback of a treat. I fear that some audience members who are unaware of the film's intentional lack of seriousness will be disappointed, which is sad, because as a throwback to the glorious days of 1980s horror cheese, ""Jennifer's Body"" is absolutely wonderful. The cultural clash is also great, and almost more insatiable than Jennifer's craving for teenaged male flesh. 8/10.",Jennifer's Body
53,davispittman,Different....,6,4 November 2016,"Jennifer's Body sure is a different kind of film. Megan fox did really well with her starring role of Jennifer. I also really liked Amanda Seyfried here in her co-starring role. I feel like the rest of the cast did a pretty good job, and I especially liked the actor that played Chip, Amanda's boyfriend, I just really thought that that was a good casting decision and I really liked how they developed his character. Amanda and her boyfriend chips chemistry and relationship was very well-developed in the movie. I also thought the acting was really good, and the writing wasn't too bad, it's pretty average for a teenage flick. Some of the killings and the bloody violence was just a bit too gory for my taste and I thought went too far. There is one particular scene in which the killing and the aftermath is just so graphically portray that it's hard to keep looking at the screen. Also, during the Satanic ritual in which the band sacrifices Jennifer, I thought that the way they went about it was kinda strange, I thought that scene was both layed out poorly and written poorly. You certainly do get a lot of things that you don't usually see a lot of in a movie with Jennifer's Body. That list includes a Satanic ritual and sacrifice, spontaneous totally out of the blue lesbianism (that seemed forced and didn't make a lot of sense to me), and such heavy material geared towards the high school age group. Overall, Jennifers body is a pretty average teenage flick with good acting but far too graphic bloody violence.",Jennifer's Body
54,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"officially unRazzling Megan Fox! hear ye, hear ye, let it be known!",8,15 November 2015,"Doing research on Wikipedia today, I stumbled across the history of the Golden Raspberry awards and took a peek to see how many of the movies in my DVD collection and how many of my favorite actresses were so gloriously discredited. Lo and behold, there was tonight's DVD screening at ElectricLadyLand, Megan Fox nominated for JENNIFER'S BODY. I had up till then only seen the downloaded trailer, so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Anyway, I do not collect Oscar-winning movies and I do not enthuse about serious actresses, I, being RavrnGlamDVDCollector, am on about cute stuff, young, likable, really, really cute starlets. So who cares? Well, me, actually! The movie might suffer! So I had a little bit of foreboding at the back of my head, but bravely settled in with my snack and... Well, wow, what were they thinking? Tell me what the hell was wrong with Megan Fox? I should tie you to a chair and get at it with a pair of pliers :) only kidding! while you tell me what was wrong with Megan Fox. For you know what was wrong with Megan Fox? Megan Fox is ***king beautiful and you can't have her and you are oh-so-sour- grapes about that and you gotta do something about it SPOILSPORT THAT YOU ARE and you have to take a dump on the poor kid and saddle her with a bleep- bleep-bleep effing Razzle award. Well, take your Razzle award and...:)The part of Jennifer calls for an extremely confident girl who just knows she is the pooh, the hottest pooh on two long legs. A girl who can, because of this, act in the smoothest coolest unattainable way, a killer in the sexual stakes. Megan Fox was 100% what the role required. She did it 100% effectively flawlessly gracefully beautifully WOW YES or in the spirit of the poster, HELL YES!!Megan Fox, some lousy old dudes with nothing better to do did you a nasty disservice. I am also a lousy old dude, but I am fair (and smitten with your foxy face) and with every inch of me (ooh-ah-er, I didn't mean it like that) I am undoing your Razzle nomination.

There is a whole lot of unfair treatment for pretty newcomers. An impulse to tar and feather them. By all means, if the charge would stick, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO SO! But be fair! In this case, objectively seen, even if I look at her performance while forcing myself not to favor her in any way, I cannot fault her.

55,TdSmth5,Surprisingly funny,7,22 September 2009,"This movie is not as much of a horror film as it could have been although there is some amount of gore and fake blood and fake something else. What stands out mainly is the script, which is rather funny. Unfortunately in a punchline-funny sort of way. Sometimes infantile but nonetheless funny. Similar to a Kevin Williamson script but without the Mensa pretensions.At the same time the very same script and its dialogue is the main obstacle in this movie. Because the script sounds like a series of punchlines, there isn't much in terms of a conversation and it doesn't lend itself to a developed storyline and action. The attractive cast (Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried) save this movie- any less pretty actresses could have ruined this movie. A lot seems disconnected and episodic. Another issue is that the movie can't make up its mind who is the main character. We're supposed to believe its Needy (Seyfried) but she is mainly Jennifer's sidekick. A final annoyance is the return of the late 90s insistence on making movies marketing tools for CDs. And this movie is a nasty return to those times when the audience had to put up with song after song to get us to buy the soundtrack.On the positive, there are a lot of good ideas here. How Jennifer turns demonic is quite hilarious- a band seeking stardom through Satan but the sacrifice went wrong by involving not a virgin but a slut. Jennifer's body, now demonic needs its share of male human blood to look attractive and gain powers, otherwise Jennifer turns lethargic and unattractive. Oddly enough, Jennifer never goes after her killers or even after easy prey, instead the script forces her into complex killer/mating rites. Jennifer seems to endure a lot of suffering-although that isn't made explicit-before she actually feeds.In the end, the two friends- formerly best friends forever, with matching necklaces to prove it- will fight each other over Needy's boyfriend. Then there's the obligatory concert and graduation party... Has there ever been a teen movie without those? Overall it's a very funny teen movie that is not very scary but does have some gore. And it also has the hottest scene in an American film in a long time: Fox and Seyfried kissing close-up.",Jennifer's Body
56,Jonny_Numb,Feast and Famine,5,30 September 2009,"Winning an Oscar for a first film is a perilous position for a screenwriter to be in, for with adulation comes high expectation, and with high expectation comes hype that is almost always self-defeating. Such is the case with ""Jennifer's Body,"" the sophomore script from Diablo (""Juno"") Cody, which takes an uncomfortable union of concept, content, and direction (by Karyn Kusama), and transforms it into a film I really WANTED to like, but in the end couldn't. Marketed as a hip, self-aware horror flick, it never delivers much beyond the norm of the genre (it follows firmly in the tradition of Kevin Williamson, who gave us ""Scream"" and ""The Faculty"" over a decade ago), and passages of heartfelt emotion are shortchanged for ridiculous horror segues (an indie band sacrifices a virgin to make a pact with the Devil, for instance) and Cody's own contrived linguistic quirks. The quirks worked for ""Juno,"" which told a dramatic story populated by fully realized characters and peppered with moments of bittersweet humor. ""Jennifer's Body"" almost succeeds based on the strength of its central duo: the titular cheerleader (Megan Fox) and her bespectacled, dorky BFF, Needy (Amanda Seyfried), who undergo serious issues when Jennifer becomes a literal man-eater; the bond between them is so palpable and effective that it almost saves the film when it goes off into the realm of bloodshed and digital trickery. If Cody's script can't find a balance between the horror, the humor, and the pathos, director Kusama steers the film even more erratically, resulting in a tone that remains unsettled until the very end. Ultimately, ""Jennifer's Body"" has its share of visually arresting moments and fine performances (particularly Seyfried's), but it has much less to offer than its obvious (and far superior) influences: Jacques Tourneur's (and Paul Schrader's) ""Cat People"" and the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy (which took the metaphorical monstrosity of puberty and its own clever dialog into much more exciting territory).",Jennifer's Body

58,aidanratesmovies,An enjoyable mess,5,16 August 2021,"A weird and fast paced blend of quirky teen comedies and subpar horror flicks- Jennifer's body doesn't really work as either type of film its trying to imitate, but it is unique- and rather entertaining. This is one of the weirdest films i've seen to be honest. It's not just the blend of horror and teen films that sets it over the top though, but the tone and execution of ideas which needless to say can make the film quite confusing. The screenplay holds too much back from the audience for us to grasp or care about what's going on, and it's often poorly written dialogue seems almost done on purpose. Needless to say, it's probably not anything i'd watch again- but for what it is- it was entertaining to say the least. Amanda Seyfried does her best in the lead role, and Megan Fox is about what you would expect but perfectly cast as the part to say the least. The look of the film is quite well done, and all the costumes of the characters are pretty well thought out- as well as some of the special effects throughout. In the end, Jennifer's Body is a memorable mess with some good moments- but mostly results itself at a B-movie value with some A-list talent.My Rating: 5.5/10.",Jennifer's Body
59,I_Ailurophile,Deliciously over the top,8,7 June 2021,"Bloody, silly, sexy, morbid fun: 'Jennifer's body' goes all in on the story it wants to tell, indifferent to the very idea that it's ever too much or too little.The flow of the film is weirdly riveting right from the start, beginning with a scene of Needy (Amanda Seyfried) introducing the story from a perspective after the fact. In so doing, we see a side of Seyfried we're certainly not accustomed to, and it's a delight. From there follows some awkward high school exposition, then some very sudden, shocking death and destruction - before the first jarring, vivid look at Jennifer's (Megan Fox) transformation.This is so much fun!Everything is greatly exaggerated and over the top - the dialogue, the soundtrack, effects, performances, the story beats generally. The camera lingers lasciviously on Jennifer and affords Fox many opportunities to show off her physique, though never so much as to feel gratuitous or exploitative - it's all in keeping with the darkly comedic tone of the picture. Even the well-done, carefully considered makeup and wardrobe follows that slant. The screenplay doesn't leave much room for subtlety, but it does round out the narrative with some demon lore to keep viewers engaged.That's not to say that 'Jennifer's body' is perfect. It emphatically tries to be too much, but actually is a bit too little. The promise made early in the movie of a sensual bloodbath never actually comes to fruition. Where we may have expected a grand finale to fulfill those expectations, the movie instead has chosen poignant story beats to close out the tale that has all along focused on Needy and Jennifer's friendship. That's not an inherently bad narrative choice, but given the thrust of this tale as it was built from the start, the sudden restraint is an unwelcome intrusion into a feature that absolutely would have benefited from still more bombastic violence.Although it falls short of the picture we expected to see, it's still highly enjoyable. Pointedly garish as so much of the production is in its excess, the narrative as a whole is fun, well written, and rather original, which isn't something one can say often. The way that Seyfried and Fox are centered in this horror comedy is a refreshing change in a genre customarily dominated by a male perspective.'Jennifer's body' is imperfect, and doesn't entirely satisfy the potential of its own design, but is still solidly made and worth checking out.",Jennifer's Body
60,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Take on High School with a Creature Feature Twist,7,12 March 2021,"This film is one that I actually saw it in theater when I was in college. I'll admit, the major reason was my crush on Megan Fox. I did enjoy this movie and even picked it up on DVD some time later. This is one that I periodically come back and seen, with the most recent viewing as part of the Summer Challenge Series over on the Podcast Under the Stairs as one of the last movies to finally finish that list. The synopsis here is a newly possessed high school cheerleader turns into a succubus who specializes in killing her male classmates. Can her best friend put an end to the horror?We actually start this with our title character Jennifer (Megan Fox) lying in bed. We see a woman look through the window, Needy (Amanda Seyfried). Jennifer looks over and she is gone. We then shift to a mental institution where Needy is now confined. We learn that she didn't always act like this. She was meeker while now being violent and aggressive. She then takes us back to what caused her to be where she is.Needy and Jennifer are best friends. Needy is a nerd while as the synopsis alludes to, Jennifer is the head cheerleader. Needy is dating Chip (Johnny Simmons) who is in a band. Jennifer being who she is a form of bully and she wants Needy to come to the only bar in town to see a band that is playing there called Low Shoulder. Despite her hanging out with Chip, Needy gives in and decides to go.Once there we do really see that everyone is in love with Jennifer and that she knows it. They go to meet with the band, which is fronted by Nikolai (Adam Brody). Needy overhears the band and think they want to sleep with her best freind. We hear that they are looking for a virgin and Needy confirms that she is. She tactic though is sway them from wanting to mess with her. When Needy tells her, Jennifer finds it funny and confirms that is not the case.The band plays and then a fire breaks out in the bar. There is a mad dash to get out and many do not. Once outside, Jennifer is in shock and Nikolai steps in. He gives her a drink. She is in shock and Nikolai convinces her to get in his van and come with them, which she does. This is all much to the dismay of Needy.Needy goes home and calls her boyfriend. She tells him what happens and then her doorbell rings. She goes down to check it, but there is no one there. We see a shadow move behind her. She gets off the phone and then goes to check in the kitchen. It turns out that it is Jennifer. She is bloody and opens the refrigerator. She takes out a chicken and devours it. Something isn't right with her as she throws up a thick black liquid on the floor. Whatever came out of her is moving and freaks out Needy. Jennfier also growls in a weird voice and leaves.The next morning, Needy looks tired and we learn that she does due to being up all night to clean up the mess. Jennifer on the other hand comes in and looks amazing. The whole town is shook up after what happened. Strange things also start to happen and it is all Jennifer's fault. She is murdering the guys around town in order to stay beautiful. This causes a rift between her and Needy. The question then becomes, can she do what she has to in order to stop Jennifer?I have to say that I was personally impressed with this film. This last viewing was with Jaime and part of the selling point is that she enjoys the movie Juno. I bring this up as the writer of this movie is Diablo Cody who wrote that movie as well. What I found interesting is that the director here being Karyn Kusama as I really like her movie of The Invitation.To delve into this movie, what impresses me here is the take on high school that we're getting. Fox looks a bit old to be in high school, but I can overlook that as I love slasher films. Cody and Kusama do a great job at embodying that high school is rough. I like that they're breaking the mold by having Needy and Jennifer being best friends. The problem though is that their friendship is toxic for Needy. Jennifer bosses her around and she's able to. Heck, her nickname being Needy makes a lot of sense. Chip is there to build up Needy, but Jennifer really does rule this place.I think this movie has an interesting look to what happens to Jennifer as well. She's sleeping with a local police officer named Roman Duda (Chris Pratt). I'm assuming this started when he was till in high school and never left. Jennifer is gorgeous, let me establish that. She is also small town though. There is no one there to rival her. Nikolai is digging what she is doing, but we see what happens when she goes off with him. There is definitely a commentary here on rape without actually going through with the act. That is unless you consider the symbolism of her being sacrificed with a knife, which is phallic shaped. Plus she completely loses what innocence she has when she comes back from the ritual.Speaking of this ritual, I like the premise of how Jennifer becomes the succubus that she does. Low Shoulder is struggling as an indy band. Their plan is to sacrifice a virgin, make a pact with the devil to become famous and that is what they do. The problem is that Jennifer isn't a virgin. This causes her to become a succubus. I think this is genius as she is already hot. Succubi are described this way and I think this works. She can lure in men as victims including Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), Jonas Kozelle (Josh Emerson) and even Chip to an extent. It is done though in a natural and subtle way.That's all I want to delve into with the story so I'll shift over to the acting. I think that Fox and Seyfried are great as our leads. Fox just has the look that is needed for the role and was really born to play it. Her acting isn't great, but I think part of my gripe though is with the writing. Cody tends to write characters that are as believable in their dialogue as it is too quirky. They do well with making Seyfried look mousey despite how attractive she is. Her portrayal as Needy is probably the best performance in the movie. Simmons is solid in support along with Brody, Pratt, Gallner and even J.K. Simmons and Amy Sedaris in their cameos. There isn't a bad performance though and the acting works overall.Next would be effects. I think for the most part there good. The blood has good color. We don't really get to see the attack scenes, which is fine. The aftermath we get to see works well enough for me. There is some CGI that we get in this movie. It isn't great, but it really isn't enough to ruin the movie. I do want to give credit to the cinematography though. I can tell now we have a woman director. It is tastefully done to show attractive Jennifer is without necessarily needing to show too much skin. There are some strategic things done with the angles and shots for sure.Then the last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. I actually dig the song by Low Shoulder. It has a sound that really fit the era this movie was made. Aside from that, we get music like Fall Out Boy and other groups that also fit the time. It isn't great, but I think the soundtrack really does fit for what was needed.In conclusion here, I think this is a solid movie. I'm not going to say it is great by any stretch though. There is an interesting premise here with this band wanting to make it big and messing up Jennifer's life, causing her to become a demon for what they do. It showcases how high school can be tough and how a beautiful woman can get her way. The acting is solid and most of the effects as well as the soundtrack work. Some of the dialogue doesn't necessarily work for me as it doesn't feel natural, which is an issue for sure. Overall I'd say this is above average movie in my opinion. It can be rough if you weren't in high school or college when it came out, but I think the creature idea still makes it work.",Jennifer's Body
61,guisreis,Two traditions of vampire stories merge in a high-school horror film,6,18 November 2014,"Not a good film, but not awful either. In the beginning, it seems to be worse (the high school silly stuff helps to give that impression), but after some time I understood that it was not meaningless as the screenplay initially looked like. The approach is in between the blood-sucking vampire tradition and the ""vamp"" femme fatale. The latter was quite common in early depictions of vampires in the movies, very different from the supernatural undead that we use to understand as that evil creature. Megan Fox, who does a good job, obviously fits the ""vamp"" evil femme fatale role very well. In spite of having many flaws (like the ridiculous and unrealistic reaction of the people to the murders and burning), this movie has been able to merge the two traditions in vampire film history, what is quite interesting.

Diablo Cody's script deliberately presents unlikeable idiotic characters spewing overly cheesy teen dialogue, mostly catchphrases. The scenario is neither funny nor scary and the whole thing just feels totally wrong. After seeing Juno and Girlfight, I can be pretty sure I'm right when I say that Karyn Kusama and Diablo Cody are too smart to do this kind of junk. This is the kind of material which Sam Raimi can do justice to. Drag me to Hell is the horror comedy of the year, not this one.The plot is lame from the beginning. Jennifer is a narcissistic girl who goes from mean-spirited to evil spirited one night when she turns into a demon following the after math of a fire which takes the lives of half her schoolmates. She starts a frenzy at school seducing, raping at eating all the boys, Now it's up to her best friend to stop her.If the film is supposed to act as a pro-feminist piece like Girlfight, then I'd have to say that not only it it a failure but it is a backfire.

While Ellen Page was likable and funny enough to keep the inevitable ""who really talks like that?""-question away, Megan Fox doesn't seem to have much talent for comedy and can't make the script sound better than it actually is. Thankfully, this movie does manage to run at a fair pace and the story is so hilariously far-fetched that you have to respect the effort. There's plenty of stuff that doesn't make sense (what kind of naive person would sacrifice someone like Jennifer as a virgin?), but it feels like all the nonsense is part of a big picture, an honest attempt at an exploitation movie spoof. Stylistically, the movie works. It feels creepy (think Elm Street), it's fairly suspenseful and the ending is perfectly fitting.

65,lewiskendell,"Jennifer's body is fine, it's the script that needs help.",5,10 April 2010,"I could have guessed that this movie was written by Diablo Cody, even if that wasn't a huge part of the reason it was on people's radar in the first place. Well that, and Megan Fox. Jennifer's Body is another showcase of Diablo's trademark dialogue, and once again, it just seems a little forced. It's always hard to invent slang. Occasionally, it works (Clueless), but most of the time, it just doesn't. It was a part of the overall charm of Juno (a largely unnecessary part), but it didn't really fit into Jennifer's Body (pun not intended), at all. I didn't hate the movie, I just feel like there's a lot of missed opportunities. It's not a razor-sharp, funny look at teenage girls, like Mean Girls was. It's not a hardcore horror joyride, like Drag Me to Hell. It's a watered-down mixture of both those things. Jennifer's Body was a good idea, it just suffers from being mediocre at several things, but good at nothing in particular.",Jennifer's Body
66,Lady_Targaryen,"Very weak and silly, at best you can watch on TV",5,7 October 2010,"Needy Lesnicky is a geek girl, who has the beautiful Jennifer Check as her best friend. Although Needy is always doing things to please Jennifer, the opposite doesn't happen very often. One night, Needy and Jennifer go to the concert of a rock band that Jennifer likes, and the place is set on fire. Jennifer is abducted by the band in their van, appearing many hours later,covered in blood, throwing up a dark liquid and with a very strange psychotic behavior. From the next days on, many of the boys from their school are found dead and with parts of their bodies eaten. Needy starts to suspect of Jennifer's behavior, until Jennifer tells Needy what happened to her: She was sacrificed by the band members in a black magic ritual,in order to make them have more success and fame.The only problem is that Jennifer was not a virgin as the band thought, so instead of dying,she was transformed into a flesh-eater succubus.I need to be honest and say that the reason I decided to watch this movie was because I liked a lot the trailers and thought the movie would be at least fun. But for my bad surprise, the movie is neither funny or frightening, in fact, its very bland. I think they gave too much expectations on Megan Fox' popularity , so they didn't care so much about the script. I am even surprised to know that the person who wrote the script was Diablo Cody, the same person who wrote the script for the acclaimed Juno.In my opinion this is not the worst movie ever made in the movie industry, but it's definitely not worth paying for the DVD or for a rent.

67,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Jennifer's Body""- A genuinely fun and cheeky concept is sadly let down by unimaginative direction and a lack of tonal focus.",5,9 March 2018,"As a follow-up to her breakout hit ""Juno"", the 2009 horror-comedy ""Jennifer's Body"" seemed like a logical and yet bold move for writer Diablo Cody. Something very different that would allow her to stretch her creative chops and show that she could work in other genres, while still maintaining her quirky style and clever dialogue. And indeed, it seems that from a writing perspective, Cody did a pretty good job. Though the film was much-maligned by both critics and audiences, it's clearly not the fault of the script. Scenes flow well, characters are instantly established and the dialogue is snappy and memorable.No, the big problem here is uneven and oft-unimaginative direction and a lack of tonal focus. It takes what could have easily been a fun, wild satire along the lines of ""Ginger Snaps"" or ""The Cabin in the Woods"", and leaves it feeling dull and bland all too often, with only the occasional fleeting glimpse of brilliance.Amanda Seyfried stars as ""Needy"", a classic bookish High School girl whose best friend Jennifer (Megan Fox) is the shining example of a typical shallow preppy chick. She cares about boys and fashion more than her own basic well-being or future, and her penchant for rash decisions leads her into trouble more often than not. When the two manage to escape a mysterious fire one night at a night-club, Jennifer vanishes with the lead-singer of a lousy rock-band, only to re-emerge a different person. She's been changed, now meaner and wilder than ever before... and with a thirst for young blood! Needy quickly realizes that her friend has been possessed by a demonic force courtesy a satanic ritual, and must figure out a way to stop her before she kills off the entire school!To start, I actually really enjoyed the cast. While Fox has been the subject of scrutiny as of late due to her mainly being cast for her looks moreso than her abilities, I think she's quite good as the titular ""villain"" that is the demonically-possessed Jennifer. It's a character that plays to her seductive strengths, and she nails it. Seyfried is also quite charming and fun as our heroine Needy, with a pathos and vulnerability that I enjoyed. And J.K. Simmons, Johnny Simmons and Adam Brody round out the supporting cast in very good performances. Especially J.K. Simmons, who shines as a troubled teacher despite a somewhat limited amount of screentime.And, as I mentioned above, the writing is fairly well-accomplished. Cody is a genuine talent, and her skills are on full display here for the open minded to see. Her sense of pacing is smooth and fluid. Her ear for dialogue is fantastic. And she has a lot of playful fun with conventions and tropes, both using and subverting them when she sees fit. It really is a great concept, and from a technical writing standpoint, Cody does well with the material.Unfortunately, the direction of Karyn Kusama is what essentially tanks the entire project, despite the fun writing and gung-ho cast. While Kusama has subsequently made some really high quality films in the years since, this was unfortunately relatively early in her career- a period of time where her work was extremely hit-or-miss. Either really good... or really, really bad. And this was one of the misses. Kusama frankly seems lost behind the camera, unsure of how to juggle the comedy and the creepiness and how to deliver the tone that Cody's script is going for. So she just sort-of... lets it play out in the blandest of ways. The lighting is flat. The camerawork is standard. Composition is basic. It's not bold or imaginative or really even all that interesting to watch. And it just brings down the energy constantly because neither the jokes nor the scares land with much impact, outside of one or two somewhat inspired moments. And it has the unfortunate effect of making the two tones feel near non-existent. There's no real focus on tone, style or... frankly much of anything. The direction just makes the whole film fall flat on its face.Thankfully, I don't think the film is a total loss. As I said, it's exceptionally well-written and the cast does a great job with the material. But it had so much more potential. And it's genuinely sad to see that potential go unfulfilled due to lackluster direction. So, I'm giving ""Jennifer's Body"" a very middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10. In more capable hands, this easily could have been an 8. Maybe even a 9. But as it stands- it's just mediocre.",Jennifer's Body

I liked the movie before but didn't thought it was rewatchable but I have to say I was wrong. Megan Fox sure deserves better, She was sexy, witty, sharp and overall brilliant in the movie. You don't see anyone like that anymore who owns the screen unapologetically sexy and fierce.The movie is supported by wonderful supporting cast Amanda Seyfried, Chris Pratt, Kyle Gallner, Johnny Simmons, J.K Simmons, Amy Saderis and Adam Brody.I hope we get to see more unapologetic fierce characters on screen instead of politically correct characters.

71,pyrocitor,"Only a few ""salty morsels"" of enjoyment rather than the promised deranged fangfest",6,25 March 2010,"While women or womanhood have always played a prominent role in the horror genre, their capacity disappointingly proves almost exclusively some variation of victimhood or sexualisation. So, to see not only a horror film written and directed by women, but also starring them as both struggling protagonist and satanic adversary seemed as progressively radical a change as any in terms of breathing fresh, off-kilter life into the genre. And what proves particularly frustrating about Jennifer's Body, the resulting concoction, is that it demonstrates so many promising roots of being exactly that kind of genius, offbeat horror comedy, but follows through on so few of them, leaving a final product intact with much to appreciate but little to genuinely sink one's teeth into. ""Hell is a teenage girl"" is the film's opening offering, suggesting a thematic exploration of the struggles of young womanhood, crises of identity and motivation through conflicting influences from peers, parents and media. And to a minor extent the film does pursue such questions, but ultimately appears uneasy about delving into them in any degree of depth (and oddly enough it is the film's men who are given a more drastic bout of stereotype bending - sensitive, intelligent and compelling, rather than the usual collection of dumb, sex-obsessed jocks). In fact, such uneasiness permeates the film on the whole, indecisively wavering between sending up horror clichés or banking on them (making the film neither particularly funny nor scary), aiming for pseudo-profundity or trashy entertainment and tweaking mainstream narrative conventions and expectations or succumbing to them. It is as if lauded screenwriter Diabolo Cody and director Karyn Kusama initially aimed for a far edgier and funkier film initially (the sporadic Evil Dead references suggest gunning for a more irreverent tone than the one achieved) but were stopped in their tracks part of the way through the planning process, whether through self-doubt or studio interference. Regardless, it is unlikely that any parties involved and their conflicting attempts could have found the uncomfortable squirm of a result particularly satisfying, nor will the majority of prospective audiences.That said, the film boasts enough bite to make it a worthwhile experience, overall wasted opportunity or not. Like in universally acclaimed prior work Juno, Cody's hip-lingo stuffed script offers a welcomely skewed take on the usual teen clichés (though those who found it to be too much in Juno will be similarly bemused with her offerings here), and there is fun to be had in many of the vindictive punchlines (""you're killing people!"" ""no, I'm killing boys""). The real shame is that such a sense of fun isn't carried over into the supernatural carnage on the whole: largely left off-screen or hampered by tedious CGI, Jennifer's demonic rampage feels altogether too tame and drawn out to evoke much of a sense of threat (which makes it somehow fitting when the town barely reacts to the strange slew of killings, yet still befuddling in terms of narrative continuity), making the film lag and feel somewhat devoid of a real purpose. The sporadic laughs and lively soundtrack pick up the slack somewhat, but as it stands, Kusama's film feels a murky soup of conflicting, underdeveloped ideas and aims.It is refreshing to see Megan Fox in a role which requires more than her, in tight clothes, interacting with giant robots, and as Jennifer she demonstrates an unprecedented command for both comedic timing and enjoyable nastiness, even if her 'superficial bitch' routine feels a little too familiar to fully function as a standout performance. Amanda Seyfield breathes appealing innocence and charm into her straight laced 'frumpy friend' Needy, though she particularly excels as the film approaches its close and she is finally given more breathing room in terms of her character. Johnny Simmons feels a breath of fresh air as a boyfriend figure who balances charm and sensitivity with endearing daftness while still believable and likable. Adam Brody is a riot, sending up the 'indie rock band headliner' cliché with malicious joy, and J.K. Simmons similarly works comedic magic on a thankless 'exposition vehicle' teacher role, complete with a voice tuned to nasal perfection, a mop of curls and a hook for a hand. Had the film been used as either a vehicle for gender exploration and stereotype bending, an outlet for trashy horror entertainment or out and out comedy, the film could easily have proved a noteworthy contemporary genre classic, but through instead pitching a muddled mix of somewhere yet nowhere in between, it offers only traces of promise. At best, Jennifer's Body only grumbles where it should howl in demonic glee - hardly a total waste, but lacking the guts to truly sink in. -6/10",Jennifer's Body

73,Sirus_the_Virus,I'd rather watch more of Jennifer's body than Twilight.,8,26 December 2009,"Diablo Cody, after winning the Oscar for her first film Juno, returns with Jennifer's body. Jennifer's body obviously isn't perfect. But there is a ton to admire. Cody once again gives us the ultimate screenplay. There are lines like""Of course it's true I read it on Wikipedia"" or ""It's the best thing Jesus created since the calendar"". Those kind of lines are used in Juno. That was a brilliant film. Mostly thanks to Ellen Page's performance.Yet again, we have another great lead actress. Though not as good as Ellen Page. Still convincing and good. We never really see Megan Fox do much acting in films. It'sa a shame. That Michael Bay takes her for granted. Apparently, when she asked him what do to, he said to run and scream. Clearly, Diablo Cody and director Karen Kusama were thinking the opposite.Fox isn't a great actress. But she's better than what you'd expect. The thing that I appreciated about this film is the dialogue. Cody still sticks the similar dialogue that Juno had. Except this is a totally different story and genre. I also liked it's plot. It's an original, funny, and smart film.Megan Fox stars as Jennifer. Amanda Seygfried stars as Needy(Nickname). The two have been friends for many years. Jennifer is a bit of a bitch while Needy is needy and nerdy. One night when a bar burns down, Jennifer goes with a band. The next day, she is very odd. That is because this satantic band did a virgin sacrifice on her. But she wasn't a virgin. So she comes back from the dead and starts eating boys. Johnny Simmons plays a Paulie Bleeker type character. J.K. Simmons plays a teacher. And that is most of the cast. Adam Brody plays the lead singer. Jennifer's body is hot. It's a shame because you almost see Megan Fox naked. Almost. She is sexy.Jennifer's body obviously isn't art. But it was very underrated. It is never scary. Cause Cody focuses on the dialogue. Occasional scary moments arrive. I appreciated the film for it's dialogue and the acting. Fox and Seygfried do well. 2009 was a good year for horror films. Jennifer's body was an overlooked one. Diablo Cody should start doing the screenplay's for Twilight(lord knows those films need them). I would love to see more of Jennifer's body than Twilight.

74,jaredmobarak,I'm a kicker; it says so in my chart  Jennifer's Body,6,11 September 2009,"I'll admit to not being very excited to see Jennifer's Body on first look. Coming as a fast-tracked script, hot on the heels of Diablo Cody's successful debut Juno, it just looked rushed, abused, and left for dead. After the production house Fox Atomic folded and dissolved back into its parent, the future did not look bright. However, being a teen horror flick starring Megan Fox had to all but assure it a theatrical release of some sort. And here it is at the Toronto Film Festival as part of the Midnight Madness series. I had hoped to view it in that atmosphere and the spectacle it would become, but instead had to settle for a press screening during the day with about five other attendees rather than the rowdy sellout crowd including Fox herself. Thankfully though, the film didn't need a circus to make it fun, it does it all by itself. Camp galore and intentional unintentional laughter help make up for any shortcomings to the horror genre on the whole. But then isn't a complete subgenre created around fun, pop culture, and absurdity? If I've learned anything from this film it is that you never sacrifice a non-virgin to the devil when only a virgin can do the trick  it's just not done people. If any credit can be given to Cody—despite the very hyper-tween dialogue that was cute in Juno, but eventually more and more annoying, especially here—it is in the inventive creativity used on the whole ""sell your soul to the devil"" idea. Usually when a ritual act of that kind is committed, bad things happen to those that signed the contract. Here, however, through an occult loophole, the botched deal causes a rift in dimensions and leaves a possessed cheerleader out for human flesh. Because, honestly, what's better when needing to clear up blemishes, liven your hair, and add a little glow to your cheeks then blood? In perfect casting, that of a not-so-talented actress in Megan Fox, Cody's dialogue fits right at home with the campiness as well. Fox's delivery is so tongue-in-cheek that whether or not she'd have acted the same if trying to be serious, the role is on the money. Seductive, sarcastic, and deadly, Jennifer's body is indeed a lethal weapon.It is not just the somewhat tired devil angle being flipped on its head that's the only surprise, though, nor is it the fact that I had a good time with a ""bad"" film. The cast is full of memorable cameos as well as effective leads, the blood and gore never go too crazy and oftentimes occur off screen with only the result shown, and the storytelling structure successfully is bookmarked with moments that take place after the bulk of the action. The story is actually a retelling of what happened by the true star of the film Needy, played by Amanda Seyfried. Here is a mousy little girl that is best friends with the hottest and most popular high schooler in their sleepy town. She has an equally geeky boyfriend and wardrobe, but the sandbox history with Jennifer to keep her ""cool kid"" cred alive. This is the Needy we are introduced to in the trailer, but most definitely not the one we see in the opening scene. No, that one is a stone-cold kicker, locked inside a mental institution/prison, scars over her body and fan mail/gifts flowing in. The film isn't about Fox's titular Jennifer and her demonic possession; it's about Seyfried's Needy and how such a sweet girl could become so utterly bad-ass.With a whole cast of people having a good time hamming things up, there are always a couple standouts. Not counting a fun cameo by genre vet Lance Henriksen, the performances by Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, and Adam Body beg mention. Young Simmons is a precisely calculated bundle of nerves and awkwardness playing Needy's boyfriend Chip. He epitomizes the naïve boy stumbling on his words and left without a backbone when Jennifer comes to steal his girl away to attend a concert at a bar outside of town. The elder Simmons actually showcases many of the same insecurities as a teacher. Pulling off his best George Segal look, this role is the exact opposite to the usual boisterous and outspoken characters we are used to watching him play. But the guy that steals the show, and every scene he is in, has to be Adam Brody. The kid just exudes charisma and possesses impeccable comic timing as the prick lead singer of Low Shoulder, a band who's single is played everywhere and becomes a sort of unofficial anthem for the town after a freak fire burns down the club they play at, along with many of the townies in attendance.And it is that scene which characterizes the tone of the film. So random and so surreal, the bar is burning to the ground, people are screaming and running around in flames, yet Fox and Seyfried are watching it all while Brody nonchalantly tells them how happy he is that they got out. Carnage left and right, he just offers a drink and an invitation to his van. The juxtaposition is so outrageous that it works completely, as do all the other moments of absurd hilarity. Because, you see, Jennifer's Body is not out to reign supreme in the slasher or psychological terror bins of horror; it strictly wants to have fun while serving up a nice helping of blood and dismemberment. Don't take anything seriously—and honestly, how could you—ignore the nails-on-a-chalkboard dialogue, (""I'm not jealous"" ""You are so Jello, you are lime green Jello), and just let the camp consume you. Complete with a pretty decent rock compilation soundtrack and end credits montage with a pretty great epilogue to the party, all involved play it right and never take anything seriously. That's a good thing.",Jennifer's Body
75,MrGKB,Much better than I expected...,6,10 September 2010,"...though far from enjoying any ""must see"" status, ""Jennifer's Body"" marks writer Diablo ""Juno"" Cody's sophomore screenplay, and truth is, it's not nearly as sophomoric as I feared. In fact, much of it is surprisingly decent, especially when Amanda ""Mamma Mia"" Seyfried is the focus (and really, the film IS about her character rather than the eponymous Megan Fox role). Ms. Fox, as the demon-possessed antagonist, is nowhere near as bad an actress as some posters here might lead one to believe, but her role isn't nearly as demanding, either: A) be pretty and vacant, or B) obscure your looks with make-up and act faux-demonic. These are not difficult tasks, and she handles them with, respectively, appropriate pulchritude and sufficient acting chops. She's a long way from winning any Oscars, mind you, but still better than any number of pretenders, some of whom are worshipped on this very site.I can understand, however, how the target audience of ""Jennifer's Body"" has turned its collective nose up at the film. Even the unrated DVD version offers little in the way of what has come to be expected from the exploitative horror genre; there's little in the way of gore, and nothing in the way of gratuitous nudity. Despite its provocative title, the film avoids sexual display in favor of suggestive salaciousness, and a displacement of sexual passion onto cannibalistic hunger. There's much in the film that thwarts the expectations of young, presumably hetero males, the target audience, and I can only assume this was intentional on the part of Cody. Fox's character declaims the loss of her anal virginity, yet the only overt sexuality she reveals occurs post-possession when she attempts to seduce Seyfried's protagonist. The males in the story are plainly ruled by their genitals, having apparently abdicated intellect; the lunk-headed Satan-worshipping band fails to ascertain whether their intended victim is genuinely a virgin, the protagonist's adolescent boyfriend has no problem enjoying her physicality, while fatally failing to give equal due to her mind, and the cardboard Goth-boy completely misses a host of warning clues from the object (which is all she serves as) of his desires. The males of ""Jennifer's Body"" are overwhelmingly bone-headed to a fault, including the mostly vestigial character played by J.K. ""Spider-Man"" Simmons. Small wonder the masculine IMDb cohorts rate this film lower than the females; they know when they're being slapped around for the pusillanimous putzes they are.No matter. ""Jennifer's Body"" may be little more than a somewhat feminist bit of dark humor masquerading as genre convention, but it's still worth a watch, if only for Ms. Seyfried's effective performance, and Cody's non-LCD script (despite whatever flaws it may have).",Jennifer's Body
76,Stampsfightclub,Star driven power at its full - stereotypical horror,5,29 November 2009,"After a drastic fire in the local bar, Jennifer (Fox) acts strangely and best friend Needy (Seyfried) becomes suspicious when her male classmates start disappearing.Do you remember the Shining? Or perhaps any other horror in the 70's or 80's? Those were the days when films were broadcast across the world with the ability to entice audience's with the idea of a plot, and more so than the main stars.In a world where everyone watches a Twilight film for Rob Pattinson instead of wanting to watch a film about conditional love we are left with the conclusion a film is only as good as its stars, which this picture is most certainly.For anyone who has been living under the biggest rock in the world over the last three years we have a new eye candy in Megan Fox. After glorified action man Michael Bay shot her looking under her car bonnet she has been hot property and what better way to market a film than promoting the world's hottest woman licking her lips and wearing little swimming in a lake? If you like the Fox in an attractive sense be prepared to have your mind warped.Scripted by Juno writer Diablo Cody this teenage romp of demons mixed with high school hits all the right buttons for any horny male teen as Jennifer pounces around giving the camera lustful stares, snogging anyone in the vicinity (male or female) and wearing an array of provocative attire. Fox has certainly shone in the films she has been in thus far, particularly How to lose friends and alienate people where her drug taking celebrity was a classic stereotype of modern celebrity. Here we see her balancing drama and horror in a fine way that allows us to see past the sexiness and bring out her undertones. But if anything this script holds her back.One of the main reasons Juno succeeded at the Oscars and winning fans was because of the ability to take a stereotype and carve a personality out of it through an unexpected pregnancy. This however has some of the most ridiculous character development of any film all year.Needy (brilliant name) can't decide if she loves Jennifer or hates her. The opening in the prison is almost a contradictory to her flashback when she's lying on Jen's bed with tears in her eyes. The narration she offers spells out rules and supposed meanings that in truth are completely irrelevant. The fact that Needy amongst other high school residents use this ridiculous never used slang make this difficult to interpret for anyone over the age of sixteen.The direction is well established through gazes into the camera and action fights but ultimately this is a market for a certain Fox that has minimal scares and whilst there are moments of clever dialogue, this is a loud and stereotypical teenage horror.",Jennifer's Body
77,spookyrat1,Diablo's Demons!,4,30 May 2019,"If it's anything I guess, it's a surprise; Diablo Cody's sophomore work, after her Academy Award winning screen writing gig with the wonderful Juno. A feminist horror-comedy called Jennifer's Body, where Megan Fox portrays the title character, who is a demonically possessed high school girl who kills her male classmates, with her best friend (Amanda Seyfried) striving to stop her. For me, it doesn't work either as horror, comedy or social comment. It's just a bad film and it seems to have gone out of its way to avoid including many of the features that made Juno, such a loved and appreciated film. This is despite having Juno director Jason Reitman on board producing this time and again including the ever-reliable, always appealing, JK Simmons in the cast.Juno was chock full of charming lead and support characters. Jennifer's Body has none. Even the 2 leads crucially fail to have any chemistry, or are seen to produce any evidence of a supposedly ""best friend"" relationship. Having Seyfried's character, the weirdly named Needy, as a narrator (much of the film is structured as an extended flashback), just saying they were besties, is not enough. To invest in the characters we have to be provided with believable onscreen authentication, which we just never see in this movie. I still have no idea as to why an intelligent, mature character with a devoted boyfriend, would need (OK, yes, pun intended) to run around with the pretty-odiously drawn character, such as Jennifer. For example we see her drag Needy off to a band gig at a local tavern. When a suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing and injuring a number of their friends, starry-eyed Jennifer plainly couldn't give a stuff, as opposed to Needy ... and this is before Jennifer's body comes to be possessed by a demon! Similarly, as supposed Satanists, the band members are about as threatening as is a senior citizens' bingo get-together.The whole storyline is just weak. In terms of comedy, laughs are as rare as hen's teeth and in terms of horror, the scare factor is of the very predictable and predicated ... ""jump shock coming up next"" category. Unlike say the over-rated, but still credible Heathers, as a high school comedy, satire is just entirely absent from proceedings. A deliberately bewigged Simmons plays a dumb, naive (Wow! How unexpected!) high school principal, whilst appearing to attempt to channel Gene Wilder. We suddenly find late in the third act, that yes, teenage Jennifer does indeed have a parent, who plainly had no idea her daughter was possessed. But she only comes into the picture, to make sense of where Needy's character ends up next. The whole demonology thing is given thorough explanation and exposition courtesy of a conveniently found book in the high school library's ""occult section"", which I think, we're supposed to find, you know, really funny.Diablo Cody shouldn't be held solely responsible for the film's many failings. Director Karyn Kusama bears just as much culpability. The original idea probably had some merit and people such as Sam Raimi and Edgar Wright have demonstrated on more than one occasion, that horror and comedy can be successfully combined. But you need interesting characters, energetic dialogue and a compelling storyline. Jennifer's Body fails on all three accounts.",Jennifer's Body
78,aesgaard41,Jennifer's Body Has Definitely Not Got It Going On,5,23 November 2010,"Of all the creatures in paranormal folklore, the succubus is one entity that doesn't really get a lot of attention in Hollywood. So, when ""Jennifer's Body"" came out, I went into it with a modicum of interest. The movie revolves around the possible ersatz lesbian friendship of two friends named ""Needy"" and Jennifer. ""Needy"" is kind of a geek; Jennifer is white trash who is sacrificed by an occult rock band and comes back as a succubus who likes nibbling on her male classmates. It's not scary. Much of the movie drags on with the character development before the action starts, the missing details later filled in after the fact at a point where no one really cares. Truth is, the film is mostly filler to obsess on Megan Fox and place her in gratuitous lesbian scenes with Amanda Seyfried. There's an obvious lack of adults in this movie; in fact, J. K. Simmons is practically wasted in his role as a teacher. What annoys me about this movie is the sheer number of stupid moments in this film. Why go into the creepy woods with the creepy girl? Why go into the creepy house at all? Why are there no police investigations into the murders? The whole teen angst thing in this movie is really dragged down by the horror plot and vice versa. It's really stylized where it doesn't have to be and it's really missing exposition where it really needs it. However, despite its flawed script and gaps in credibility, the film is kind of a guilty pleasure. We really don't see a lot of female horror antagonists and Megan's colored multi- layered way of talking comes off as innocuous. Plus, telling the story in flashback is a plot device that isn't used very often so what the movie lacks in substance it almost makes up for in delivery.",Jennifer's Body

I'm not a great fan of horror movies, unless they're very very good, and so a teen horror flick is usually straight on the reject pile. But with Diablo Cody penning the words, how bad could it be? Well I'll tell you after a short summary (as usual, summary haters please omit the next paragraph).Jennifer Check and Needy Lesnicky have been friends since kindergarten and, although Jennifer is a cheerleader and Needy is a bit of a nerd, their friendship survived into high school. Needy has a steady boyfriend, Chip Dove, who is just an average teenager. Jennifer decides to take Needy to see a band she had seen on the internet called Low Shoulder. During the show a fire breaks out and several people are killed. Jennifer ends up going with the band in their van. Needy makes it home where she is met by Jennifer covered in blood. The next day Jennifer turns up at school behaving normal. This perplexes Needy and when, over the following weeks, several boys are found brutally murdered, she begins to put two and two together. Little does she know, Chip is becoming a target and time is running out.Although the dialogue is just as snappy and cool as in Juno, this movie is sadly flawed. I just didn't buy into the characters and found it all a little bit too ludicrous. A very decent performance though from Amanda Seyfried as Needy and honourable mentions go to Megan Fox as Jennifer, Johnny Simmons as Chip and Adam Brody as Nikolai Wolf.I must say there is a really good score to this movie, some great indie and rock tracks, however, a great score does not a great movie make. There were one or two good moments in the film, but again, as a whole it just didn't work for me. I guess if you're a die hard fan of Megan Fox, then by all means go and see it, there are plenty of scenes with her wearing very little. Otherwise, not recommended.My score: 5.2/10",Jennifer's Body
80,MihaiSorinToma,A below average horror movie,5,16 August 2017,"Two best friends (a nerd - Needy and a cool chick - Jennifer) escape a fire that made a lot of victims at the local club. Unfortunately, Jennifer gets caught by a rock band that performed that night at the club and is sacrificed in the devil's name. Because she wasn't a virgin, she survived and turned into a demon that could survive only by devouring live people, especially boys. Needy must find out what's going on with her friend and end her killing spree before her own boyfriend gets murdered.It's an average horror movie that only keeps you wondering what happened to Jennifer the night after the fire (it's revealed later by Jennifer to Needy). From then, killings, killings, funerals, mourning and a scene near the end where Needy must save her boyfriend and pay back to her friend and the rock band that was responsible.Quite boring actually, not very frightening and a plot which doesn't do anything to attract your interest. I was even disappointed by the ending. You might want to take a look at it if you're a fan of horror movies. As for me, a mediocre film I never want to see again.",Jennifer's Body

The actress who played Mikaela, the refreshing beauty with a brain in both TRANSFORMERS movies. And, yet, here, she played a (painfully) typical queen high school b***h!Which brings us back to the above question. One I still can't answer on my own.I mean, if this was meant to be a parody, it failed to make me laugh. Not at the intended jokes, anyway. And, if it was meant to be serious, why fill it with so many over-used cliché's (like the occult-worshipping rock band)? In short, don't waste your money on this turkey. Because, frankly, I wouldn't even dignify it with _one_ star if IMDb wasn't requiring it! No offense, guys.",Jennifer's Body
82,acidburn-10,A definite must see for Megan Fox fans,5,13 February 2011,"There have been a very mixed reception about this movie, some liked it and some hated it, but I actually quite enjoyed it, not one of my fave movies all time but it's worth watching especially to see the fantastic Megan Fox in all her glory.The plot = Jennifer (Megan Fox) and her best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried)who both live in a small town called Devil's Kettle, which only has one bar, where they attend to watch a goth/emo band called Obsession After the bar burns to the ground due to a freak fire during the performance, Jennifer follows the band back to their rape van while Needy chooses to go home. But something happens to Jennifer that night, and the next day she starts becoming a blood thirsty zombie and starts eating all the boys at school.Although a fun movie there are some rather disappointing elements, like the pacing is pretty bad and the premise is rather ridiculous, the gore is rather tame which is rather a let down it's quite refreshing to see a movie take familiar elements and use them to create an unfamiliar narrative.There's no doubt that director Karyn Kusama is capable of creating a technically sound film. Where she misses, however, is in properly balancing the comedy with the horror. It felt inconsistent It's almost depressing how Fox miss-marketed the film to pubescent boys not old enough to even get into the film to solely try to cash in on Megan's sex appeal, because the crowd the movie should be targeted to will miss out.The performances in this movie are surprisingly really good, although Megan Fox is the main standout in this movie playing one of those sexy high school girls that are so gorgeous that she's untouchable. Megan Fox was definitely born to play this part, this movie was made for her. Amanda Seyfried who plays the best friend Needy gave a well rounded and layered performance, I often enjoyed her performances in such movies as (Mean Girls and Mamma Mia), a definite star on the rise. The supporting cast, featuring Adam Brody (as the band's lead singer), J.K. Simmons (as a one handed science teacher), and Kyle Gallner (as the eccentric goth), all fit their roles seamlessly. The true break out here, however, is Johnny Simmons as Needy's boyfriend Chip. What could have been a character that could easily fade into the background is comes off as one of the most memorable. He's quirky, sweet, funny, and just all around likable.All in all not perfect by any means but a definite must see for Megan Fox fans.",Jennifer's Body
83,Darkside-Reviewer,A Demonic Mean Girls,4,12 January 2021,Jennifer's Body is your typical teenage horror movie it's not really aimed at adults or fans of horror movies. The movie is aimed at the new generation of teenagers who understand today's pop culture references and modern day slang terms or at least it was back in 2009 when it was released.Jennifer's Body tells the story of a high school teenager named Jennifer who is kidnapped by a group of men in an indie rock band. The band use Jennifer as a virgin sacrificial offering to Satan in return for becoming a rich and successful indie rock band. Turns out Jennifer isn't really a virgin so the ritual sacrifice ends with her becoming an undead demon known as a succubus. Jennifer must now eat the flesh of the living in order to remain strong and beautiful so she begins seducing boys in her high school so she can get them alone and eat their flesh. Jennifers best friend known as Needy discovers the truth that Jennifer is a succubus and begins to worry that Jennifer will eat her and her boyfriend if she doesn't stop her first.Jennifer is played by (Megan Fox) who Co Stared in the first three live action Transformer movies. Her character has little to no personality throughout the entire movie amounting to nothing more just eye candy for teenage boys. I would describe (Megan Fox's) performance as Jennifer as a demon version of the character Regina George from the movie Mean Girls (2004) only not as a funny.The death scenes aren't very graphic or gory but that's not surprising for a horror movie meant for teenagers. The theatrical cut of the movie cuts out most of the blood and violence. The extended cut of the movie isn't much better all that's added is a couple of scenes of Jennifer eating and drinking blood out of a victims gaping stomach which is nice to see but it doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being poor quality.The worst thing about this movie by far is it's awful soundtrack. This might sound like a stupid thing to complain about but there's a song in the movie played by a band based in the movie that plays about ten times. The entire soundtrack is basically just a compilation of every generic teenage rock band from the late 2000s. I hate movies that play music over every dramatic scene in the movie making every dramatic scene like a crappy thirty second music video.,Jennifer's Body
84,DonFishies,Enjoyable if you do not mind how much of an inconsistent mess it is,7,18 September 2009,"When I first heard about Jennifer's Body shortly after the release of Juno, I was a little apprehensive. How could Diablo Cody go from a beautifully hilarious and dramatic Oscar-winning picture, to a movie about a throwaway teen horror flick? It sounded like a bizarre decision, but if she threw in even a quarter of the dialogue and depth that fueled Juno, surely she could make a genre flick like Jennifer's Body work even better than the typical brand served to audiences on a monthly basis. Right? After a bizarre freak fire devastates a local bar, the titular high-school hottie Jennifer (Megan Fox) is sacrificed to Satan in a ritual gone wrong, and ends up turning into a boy-hungry demon. Her polar opposite best friend, the geeky Needy (Amanda Seyfried) keeps catching Jennifer at her most blood covered moments, and realizes quite quickly something needs to be done about her friend.The problem right from the start of Jennifer's Body is that it never wants to stick to a consistent tone. It knows it is a teen horror film at first glance, but deep down it is a dark comedy and satire. While this tradeoff goes fairly well for the first half of the film, it almost completely destroys anything it has going for itself afterwards. It never seems to be able to settle down and decide if it wants to be one, both, or neither. It becomes a bloody mess as the film nears its climax where it fails at being funny, and fails even worse at being scary. It goes from being goofy and self-aware, to just plain ridiculous faster than you can imagine. And with the hilariously terrifying Drag Me to Hell so fresh in some people's minds (the film never found the audience it rightfully deserved), this film just pales in comparison.It feels like Cody knew where she wanted to go, but stalled out halfway to the finish line. There is a great movie at the heart of Jennifer's Body, but it feels half-baked and lacking a great payoff (outside of the scene most teenage boys will find themselves replaying after it hits the web). I really wanted to love this movie, but the story just cannot sustain itself for the near two hour running time the film has. With Juno, it was polished and practically flew through its running time like it was nothing. It used plot points and weaved through story lines to its advantage. Here, the film wavers around erratically and feels like it could have used a polish – almost to the point where it seems like it was thrown into production and obvious errors were ignored because of Cody's Oscar win so close to the start of filming. Plot points (like the fire at the bar that starts the film) are thrown around almost to the point of redundancy or sheer uselessness.But much like Juno, when the film is on, it burns red hot. The quotes and one-liners that stick (and do not leave you baffled understanding their need to be witty) are hilarious. I did not laugh nearly as much as I wanted to, but the film does offer plenty of quotable material. Some of the stuff it references is just too funny not to laugh at.It kills me to say this, but like Keanu Reeves in the pitiful remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, Fox was born to play Jennifer. Critics complain about her wooden and stilted acting in the Transformers films, but here, the character practically begs to be played like that. Of course, she botches any real moments where she has to actually act, but when she is looking drop dead gorgeous or spouting off lines that she may or may not understand, she does a near perfect job. She has just enough sex appeal to make this character a believable teenage ""popular girl"", and just enough of a presence on screen to ensure people take her performance as seriously as possible (it helps that she is frequently portrayed in excessively bright clothes while everyone else is in dark or muted colours).Seyfried does an excellent job with what she is given. The character is not particularly well written, but Seyfried still manages to be the crux that holds the film up (aside from Fox's beauty), and commands the screen away from Fox as much as she can. She does not have the same overbearing personality and aura that Fox has, but her muted interior and exterior make for a very interesting secondary character. I have enjoyed Seyfried's work ever since I discovered her on Big Love, and she knows just the right emotional chords to pull to deliver the right responses.The supporting cast is not overly great, but not too bad either. J.K. Simmons does a decent job as one of the high-school teachers, as does Adam Brody as the singer of an indie band that puts the whole story into motion. There could have been a little less attention paid to Johnny Simmons, who plays Needy's boyfriend Chip, but that is simply nitpicking.Cody has a lot of work ahead of her as an artist if this film is any suggestion of where she is headed next as a screenwriter. It may have been written around the same time as Juno, but it is a much weaker film and is a disappointment no matter which way you look at it. There is just so much potential that could have been mined from the sheer idea of the film that the end result feels like the road less traveled. Even with how much there is to enjoy within Jennifer's Body, there still could have been so much more done to make it better.7/10.",Jennifer's Body

87,Java_Joe,This movie is wretched.,1,27 October 2018,"In 2007 Diablo Cody, an unknown writer, penned the movie that would put her on the map. This movie was Juno. A movie praised by critics and the audience alike for being ""real"" and having teens talk like teens. Or at least that's the narrative they were pushing because honestly, that's not what I got from it. But we're not here to talk about Juno, we're here to talk about her next movie namely ""Jennifer's Body"".Take everything that made Juno quirky and fun and with the exception of the dialogue throw that away. Leave the dialogue, replace Ellen Page with Megan Fox as the titular Jennifer, give it a supernatural spin and you have one of the worst movies of 2009.Seriously. The dialogue in this is just wretched. It's like she took the praise for Juno being so quirky and that's the only thing she brought to this. And instead of a competent actress like Ellen Page, replace her with the bland but stunningly hot Megan Fox. Megan Fox is a very pretty woman but she can't act unless she's trying to pull off bland and uninteresting but with a smoldering look. It's almost cliche at this point that she's just a pretty face.And even the normally enjoyable Amanda Seyfried felt restrained in this. Possibly because she was told not to outshine Megan who was the star. Oh well, what can you do? She's still a better actress and honestly I find her much better to look at.The movie hits on some horror cliches. Jennifer supposedly dies but comes back as a succubus or something like that. Amanda, I can't remember her name in this, winds up killing her and somehow taking on her powers but she's good in the end. I don't know. I felt it was really poorly done and highly forgettable.So unless you just want to look at pretty women giving quirky dialogue, give this one a pass.",Jennifer's Body

89,chicagopoetry,Too Experimental To Scare You,5,23 September 2009,"Jennifer's Body certainly isn't as bad as all of those who are out to attack the writer of it want you to believe, but, with that said, it isn't all that good either. It tries way, way too hard to make itself a cult classic. But the main problem with this movie is that it is too long (well, it feels long anyway) and drawn out and slow moving and kind of boring and confusing and it feels like a mish mash of unrelated concepts. It's a statement about today's big budget cinema when television's The Vampire Diaries or cable TV's Dexter is produced and directed better, shot better, acted better and is scarier than what is offered in our theaters or at the Blockbuster. I kept getting the feeling that Jennifer's Body had the potential to be a modern Carrie, that it was going to pick up any moment, but instead it just dragged on and came off as a weird feminist version of Donnie Darko. The soundtrack became annoying after about the sixth time that song from the fictional Creed-like band played. The highlight of this film of course is the lesbian scene that should of, could of went a bit further but it didn't. There are basically no special effects; everything is alluded to in shadows and silhouettes. The story is implausible, the characters don't react the way they ought to react, the entire thing is a slightly visually stunning piece of gobbly-gook that is ultimately pointless and not entertaining. And it is really not the writer's fault at all. Dario Argento, for example, could have kept this from becoming World's Greatest Dad meets Night of the Demons, but instead they had to play certain scenes for laughs instead of scares. There are some memorable one liners but those alone can't save this from being an attempt at forced campiness. This should probably be studied at film school but as entertainment it is just plain irritating.",Jennifer's Body

Jennifer's Body is above all a black comedy, but it's wisely played relatively straight and the cinematography, mood and music are all bathed in horror. It mines its comedy from taking its genre angle seriously and even though this material about a demon high school brat and a hipster band with a deal with Satan is ridiculous - it's consistently entertaining. Karyn Kusama exploits the limited range of Megan Fox's abilities and pulls a performance out of her that completely works. While she obviously has the looks for the part, her comedic timing is spot on and even though Jennifer isn't the most complex character, Fox seems to have a blast playing this demon bitch.

When we first see Jennifer after her transformation, which is at Needy's house, we see her do something that's very similar to vomiting. I don't remember exactly what (It was in January I saw this movie), but I remember it just enough. The movie is a straightforward one, concentrating on just these two characters.

99,Quebec_Dragon,Megan's body sells this weak movie that doesn't really deserve the publicity,3,19 March 2011,"I think that if Megan Fox wasn't at the top of the hottest women list when this came out, it would have gone straight to DVD. Even as a DVD, it's hard to recommend a rental even if you're a big fan of Ms. Fox's charms. She's pretty enough but the sex-appeal is somewhat lacking, which is bad considering the true nature of her character. The hottest scene would be a kissing one with her best friend Needy (yes, that's right... Needy). As for nudity, look elsewhere although you'll see her naked back, naked legs and some quick cleavage. With that superficial stuff out of the way, I felt the tone was wrong throughout the movie. It already starts really badly by showing us the main character (Needy played by Amanda Seyfried) in some kind of institution and we soon realize that the movie is going to be one long flash-back sequence. This setup destroys any little suspense this movie might have had as we know she survived and a picture tells us what happened to another protagonist. Jennifer's Body really wasn't scary or sinister even though it tried with some relatively tame gore and with some badly done scare jump scenes with the volume cranked up. I found Megan covered in blood more perplexing than unnerving. Considering the soft horror elements, the swearing (several F-words) felt out of place and also gave a R-Rating which prevented most teens from seeing this. There was a fire early on in a bar, and honestly I didn't know if they were trying to horrify us (with people on fire) or amuse us by the way it was filmed. The reactions afterwards just didn't feel believable or even credible. There was something that struck me as unconventional in an American movie as there was an attempt at showing normal safe sex, but contrasted with Jennifer's aggressive ""seduction"" of an innocent. As a b-movie comedy, it failed as the dialogue was just on the verge of being cheesy enough but not quite. It wasn't clever enough to compensate either. No really funny situations, other than perhaps the (unintentionnally?) lame dress and hair Needy wears at the end. It doesn't work as a teen movie, as we don't care about any of the characters, nor does it delve in teenage angst or problems. The special effects are rather minimal and unimpressive as the transformed Jennifer looks a bit artificial. The ""fights"" were lame especially the last one.The best moment might be when Needy runs in the woods towards the inevitable confrontation. The stirring guitar music helped a lot but even that scene felt flawed. Amanda Seyfried is obviously a good actress wasting her dramatic talents here in this shoddy story. Megan Fox plays it mostly deadpan, superficial and egocentric although she shows glimpses of real acting ability (when she's scared). Structurally wise, other than the spoiling start, it also feels as if it should end sooner as the last part is lame and drags on. Overall, it's a pretty weak movie in all aspects. Weirdly, I think it had potential to be much stronger with better writing and fleshing-out of the ambiguous relationship between Needy and Jennifer both before and after Jennifer's ""trauma"".Rating: 3 out of 10 (weak)",Jennifer's Body
100,tburke85,Jennifers Body An Okay Comedy Thriller,6,12 January 2010,"Jennifer's Body is an okay comedy horror from writer Diablo Cody most famous for Juno starring Ellen Page and Michael Cera. This movie isn't the disaster I thought it might be but it wasn't the greatest. Director Karyn Kusama does an all right job of making this film but some flaws with character development to name one weighs it down. I for one thought Megan Fox from Transformers was decent as the character of the title whose possessed by a demon. She looked normal for a change and not some glamor model who just stepped out of a magazine or something. Her co-star Amanda Seyfried is the stand out giving a very convincing and believable performance as Jennifer's best friend Needy. Her character goes through a major transformation during the course of the movie and she makes the film worth watching at least to me. Seyfried also had nice chemistry with Fox which made their friendship on screen believable. The rest of the cast of relative unknowns are good but not of them are fully developed except for maybe Johnny Simmons as Needy's boyfriend Chip. Kyle Gallner, J.K. Simmons, and Adam Brody show up for small roles who are effective in their limited screen time. The violence which involves Jennifer eating some boy are well executed and there's some humor. But the lack of character development and the dialogue at times is what weighed it down the most. Overall Jennifer's Body wasn't the best movie I've seen but it wasn't the worst either.

101,jonathanruano,Jennifer's Body -- Don't be fooled by the bad title,7,20 September 2009,"When I first saw ""Jennifer's Body,"" I thought it would be a bad movie. To my surprise, I could not be more wrong. Usually teen horror films are bad, but the people who made this one -- Director Karyn Kusama and the artist Diablo Cody (who also did the screenplay for ""Juno"") -- did something really smart. They realized that to make this film work, it was not enough just to have gore, screaming and the obligatory vomiting scene; the movie also had to be funny, witty and quirky. The result is not a masterpiece, but a film that is a lot more interesting than any other teen horror film I have seen.I won't spoil the plot. Suffice to say that ""Jennifer's Body"" has everything you could ask for in a horror movie: an Indy rock band, satanic rituals, demons, girl on girl action, beautiful women and great dialogue. It also has something else: surprisingly good actors. Amanda Seyfried does a capable job in role of a nerdy, insecure and odd high school student named Needy (whose name speaks for itself). But really Megan Fox is the standout performance here. You would not think that after seeing the two Transformer movies, but Fox has talent. With Cody's screenplay giving her the opportunity to strut her stuff, Megan Fox comes through with a truly original performance, providing her character with a lot more depth than one would expect from the prettiest chear leader in high school. Megan's not going to get the Oscar for this movie, but she is certainly someone to watch.6.5/10",Jennifer's Body
102,tributarystu,Devil's Spew,3,28 November 2009,"Despite all my best intentions, I came to hate Jennifer's Body. My main problem with it is that it fails on so many levels, while trying very hard to blend in style with content in a manner which is far from successful.Keeping in mind that some might consider these tidbits spoilers - the story goes that two ""BFF""s who have always had a subordinate relationship, are torn apart by this indie band which sacrifices one of them (Jennifer) to gain fame and glory. Sadly, as Jen wasn't a virgin, her soul was damned to live on this horrible earth forever while dealing with an annoying urge to eat the guts of people in order to keep well nourished. And then the movie explores the nothingness of this premise, while endulging itself with hipness - which really doesn't amount to much.Megan Fox may be a symbol for a lot of things, but it's clear that her acting doesn't land her the jobs she's getting. Yet, it's not her failings that make Jennifer's Body so irritating, it's the narrative that's so often soft on logic and continuity: things happen randomly, causality is either lacking or simply banal and the story itself has nothing fresh to offer. Sure, I'll submit to the idea that the little pun about indie bands and the sacrificial offerings needed to be performed in order for them to succeed was funny, but should that be deemed enough? It will be interesting to see if Diablo Cody will be able to emulate the success of Juno again, because with this try, there is nothing worth remembering.",Jennifer's Body
103,youngcollind,"Maybe not the trashy soft porn of it's marketing, but let's not swing the pendulum too far in the other direction",6,4 October 2021,"Like many, I initially avoided this as it looked like schlock made mainly to capitalize on Megan Fox's looks. Since it appears the film is taking on a sort of cult status on the internet lately, I thought it might be worth giving a shot. After viewing, I feel that both the film's admirers and critics may be taking things too far, and at the end of the day, it's just an okay teen horror flick. The lean plot is to the point and easy to follow, not completely rote but not completely unique either. The feminist undertones are subtle at best, perhaps making a point about sexual assault survivors if you squint and read into it, but mostly exploring a toxic friendship dynamic that's as deep as any high school drama. Otherwise, it operates on it's face value monster movie, with some cheesy effects and attempts at humour that lighten the mood while watering down any genuine terror. Probably the funniest part of the movie is realizing how dated 2009 is starting to seem, with references to MySpace, Fall Out Boy, and a full fledged high school emo character all making appearances. Maybe it didn't deserve to be torn to shreds like it's original reception did, but it shouldn't be exalted as a cinematic masterpiece just to prove a point about a sexist promotion campaign.",Jennifer's Body
104,mistoppi,Intriguing and absolutely delicious dialogue,8,21 May 2016,"I've seen Jennifer's Body before, and I really, really liked it. But lately I've been thinking about how great this movie actually is, and I really wanted to see it again. Like I said about a year ago, the story of Jennifer's Body is way more interesting than you'd think when you read the summary. The very beginning of the film feels not as clichéd as you'd expect this movie to be. The writing is excellent in this movie. The movie keeps you in its hook. The best part about the writing is the dialogue in this film. All those remarkable lines are simply delicious. Sure, the realism of the dialogue doesn't really make you dizzy, but it sounds good and stands out from typical dialogue. Diablo Cody's dialogue has always been impressive. While I wasn't fascinated by Juno, a film written by her, it was mostly because of the themes and plot of that film: I still liked Cody's dialogue.Jennifer's Body isn't actually a scary film, yet the makers of this film have used the horror themes excellently. There are a few jump scares that scare you for a little while, but don't actually leave you scarred, and they are pretty easy to predict. There are a few disgusting bits, few brutal and bloody bits, and supernatural horror with demons and all that jazz. All those elements work well together, like they usually do.The thing about this film is that it should be a total B-movie but it isn't. Jennifer's Body is excellent instead of ""so bad it's kind of good"". Yes, many people don't like this movie, or actually hate it, but I'm not exactly what the reason for that is? ""It's ridiculous?"" Every movie has it's ridiculous moments, otherwise they are so serious they are boring. I can't think of any reasons. The cast is so wonderful in this film. Megan Fox is such a skilled actress and she's absolutely fantastic as Jennifer. Amanda Seyfried's charm as Needy seems to be the complete opposite of Fox's charm, and together their chemistry just makes you dizzy. Wow.Jennifer's Body is one of my favourite movies. It has amazing female characters, intriguing plot and amazing dialogue. It has everything I need in a film, yet I'm not giving it the full score because of several clichés and how it's not exactly a very original movie. It's still great and definitely worth watching.",Jennifer's Body
105,dschmeding,Definitely a movie of its own kind,7,3 October 2009,"The response on this movie seems really bad and I wonder why. Honestly I am not quite sure what to thing about ""Jennifers Body"" myself but any way you watch it this movie has a lot of identity. Maybe thats what forces the negative response. First of all... this is no horror movie. Everyone who really digs into this must be retarded. Come on, a nerd befriended with a hot chick in high-school who turns into a man eating demon after being sacrificed to Satan by a satanic rock band trying to boost their career. Yes, thats the basic plot... Jennifer turns into a demon because she is not the virgin that the rock band thinks she is ... which is a ridiculous thought anyway.""Jennifers Body"" is a totally off-beat movie that is mainly focusing on Jennifers nerd friend Needy who is thrown into the situation of dealing with her friends sexual appetite that suddenly turns very literal. There is a lot of critique in this movie about modern life style, clichés and lies. Most of all embodied by the pathetic rock band who get famous because the local bar burns down while they're playing and suddenly everyone looks on a small town for sensation and suffering. I liked how they used the sing-along song through the movie, its everywhere and the band turns to heroes although they are the opposite.Even if you don't like this social commentary in the movie there is plenty of awesome scenes in the movie... like when Jennifer comes home at night after the bar burnt down, when she kills the jock and the animals are watching (reminded me of a less laughable version of Antichrist), the scene where they watch the band play their song in the bar and most of all the awesome ending of the movie (I mean after the credits began to roll). If anything then that is fresh ideas, so any rating of 1 or 2 stars is just ignorant.I give you that ""Jennifers body"" is a little uneven at times but considering the mix of genres I can forgive that. I also loved how the different characters were portrayed. Needy and her boyfriend are shown in a very realistic manner with all their weaknesses and flaws. Their sex scene intercut with Jennifers man-eating was a great mixture of the Juno characterization of normal teenagers and the media stereotypes we are constantly fed. Much of Jennifers world was like an MTV music video. So after all this is a really interesting movie thats at times hard to watch and piece together.",Jennifer's Body
106,ssvikas,Just your average thriller with a demon babe!,4,15 December 2009,"The name of the movie surely sounds seedy; but has nothing to do with overt skin shows and explicit adult content. Ah, but when you cast an actress of the order of Megan Fox, it does enough to set the screen on fire though the film is nothing spectacular. Here, it’s not about being unappreciative of thrillers but it’s always important to have a storyline that keeps up the suspense, the scenes flow well is dark enough to spook you out.School hottie and cheerleader Jennifer played by Megan Fox, the sole USP of this movie and Needy being best friends. When the two visit a bar to listen to a new band called ‘low-shoulder’, a mysterious fire leads to events that change their lives. The band sacrifices Jen thinking her to be virgin that she is not, leading the devil to take over her body. The succubus now needs flesh to stay youthful and stars preying on the boys.JB is supposed to be a film of the dark comedy and thriller genres. But amidst all the teen action, a female to female kiss and a succubus that looks ravishing, there is nothing remotely comical in the movie’s intentions. Usual thrillers scare you with a cocktail of a viewer’s hidden fears and everyday situations. But, JB is about seduction that ends with the boy turning into dinner. But, isn’t a succubus supposed to make love before it kills? After thralling audiences in the Transformers series, Megan Fox was a wonderful choice to play someone who has an irresistible exterior with the extra attitude while the devil lurks within. The movie definitely belongs to her, upping its ratings. While Fox took all the stress of looking pretty throughout, Amanda Seyfried has done well as the nerdy Needy, the buddy who nurses a long pent up frustration against a domineering Jennifer.Though JB is a thriller worthy of an Oscar winning scriptwriter Diablo Cody, it’s not bad either. There are some genuinely scary scenes and special effects that make the experience worthwhile. Though not released in India as yet, check out the DVD! And, if you think that Megan Fox’s tryst with the supernatural ends with this, wait for the ‘Jonah Hex’ releasing Mid 2010 that has bounty hunters, voodoo and armies of the undead.",Jennifer's Body
107,drunken_munki,Comedy? Says who,5,27 October 2020,"Erm, so they claim this is a comedy.I don't think there was a single joke in this entire movie and that is no exaggeration. This is a horror that fails to be a horror, so they said it was a parody and comedy.Acting is ok, the monster aspect was interesting enough but this was a bit brainded and it falls flat. The plot plays out very straight like a teen slasher flick.5/10 perfectly average movie that is not funny.",Jennifer's Body
108,Avwillfan89,The forgotten horror gem,10,30 October 2020,"Admittedly when I first watched this film, I was caught up in all the negative reviews at the time. But now that I'm older, I can absolutely see that these were wrong.One thing that doesn't get talked about enough, is that a relationship with your best friend that turns sour and destructive can have just as much of impact on your mental health and trust as a romantic partnership.Jennifer's body starts off with Needy (Amanda Seyfried) punching an orderly without any provocation in a mental institution - and the film proceeds to flash back to the character from a few months ago, when she was bespectacled and nervous.What happened to this girl?Needy and Jennifer are longtime friends in high school. Jennifer is the popular hot girl while Needy is bookish, smart but socially inept. They attend a indie rock concert of a band that Jennifer is following, and the place catches fire. As they escape, Jennifer accepts a ride by the lead singer of the band, and Needy can only watch helplessly as she is driven away - knowing full well that something bad will happen.That very same night, Jennifer wanders into Needy's house covered in blood and eating raw chicken from her fridge, before spewing out some horrifying black glue onto Needy.It gradually becomes clear that Jennifer has turned into a demon. She later explains to Needy that the rock band kidnapped her the night the club burned down. Not for a gang rape, but something far more sinister - they tried to sacrifice her to the devil in order to achieve success. But since she lied to them about being a virgin, the spell didn't work. And she needs to feast on the blood of boys in order to survive. And Needy must protect her own boyfriend from her now demonic ""best friend"" before it's too late.Horror films are always at their best when they are about something other than the supernatural horror. And in this case, it tackles and portrays brilliantly the toxicity of bad female friendships.The nerds in school tend to be unpopular in high school and successful later in life. Jennifer knows this and consistently tries to bring Needy down to her level, jealous of her boyfriend.When the demonic Jennifer lacks sustinance (AKA blood) her skin grows bad. So she plasters her face with tons of makeup while being surrounded by only pictures of herself.She is quintessentially, that friend in high school who knows she won't go anywhere in life, so she will stay the pretty popular girl forever, even though her friend has long moved on from that era.Don't write this off as a Megan Fox vehicle that went wrong. This is a female horror led drama about toxic FF friendships - something that nobody wanted to hear about at the time. It's funny, horror-filled and really well written. Absolutely check it out!",Jennifer's Body
109,RichardSRussell-1,A Female-Bonding Experience,6,21 September 2009,"Jennifer's Body (R, 1:42) — Fantasy: Supernatural, 3rd string, original, OSIT feministsWell, if you woulda asked me on the 4th of July how September would turn out, I sure wouldn't have predicted this. I figured I'd really appreciate 9 and think that Jennifer's Body was a piece of exploitative tripe. Instead, I ended up rating them the same — 6, the top of my ""up to you"" range.Jennifer's Body is, of course, utterly without redeeming social value, but it's not bad for all of that.Suppose you're one of a couple of hundred indistinguishable rock bands in America, let's call you Low Shoulder. Like all the rest, you've got a pretty-boy lead singer, adequate musicians, a slightly dim drummer, a few original songs (something like ""Thru the Trees""), the ability to cover more talented groups, no noticeable reputation or prospects, and a hankering for greater fame and glory. What chances do you have? This is where ""Satan is our only hope"" comes in.The boys leave ""the city"" and head for ""the shitty areas"", where they hope to attain national recognition by behaving more or less heroically at a small-town disaster of their own making. To seal the deal, the cookbook says they must sacrifice a virgin. Months later, riding high on newfound fame, money, and coke, they meet their just deserts following a concert in Madison, Wisconsin.These events might have made for a kind of interesting movie in their own right, but they're merely the bookends to the main story, which is what happens in Armpit, Minnesota, during those intervening months. Seems that one of the ingredients in the recipe wasn't quite as farm-fresh as advertised.That would be the eponymous Jennifer (Megan Fox, the eye candy from Transformers), hottest babe in Kettle Falls High School, who has clearly coasted by for years on her good looks. Fersher not her brains: One optimistic goth kid asks her to go to a showing of Rocky Horror, and she replies that she doesn't like boxing movies.But it's not Jennifer's movie, either, despite the title, casting, and billing. The film is narrated by, and largely seen from the viewpoint of, Jennifer's BFF from back in their sandbox days, Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicki (Amanda Seyfried, the bride in Mamma Mia! but perhaps better known to genre fans as Lilly Kane in Veronica Mars). It would be simple to say that Needy has been reduced to Jennifer's plain-jane wingman on their various social outings, but it's more complicated than that. In fact, pretty much everything in this movie is more complicated than it 1st seems.Take, for instance, the high-school teacher, Mr. Wrobleski (J. K. Simmons). His left hand is a prosthetic hook. Why? Nobody ever says, probably for the same reason that you seldom hear the phrase ""Gee, I'm breathing oxygen."" Same deal with what seems like a perfectly serviceable natatorium, which is unaccountably isolated, dilapidated, and overgrown with weeds and vines. It provides great atmosphere, but what's it doing out there? No explanation offered.Since the previews admit as much, it's not giving anything away to say that Jennifer has been possessed by a demon that causes her to do awful things. But, in an unusual twist, she doesn't keep her condition to herself, she spills all to Needy, who is properly understanding and supportive. What are BFFs for, anyway? This is, at core, a female-bonding movie.At least it is until Jennifer's appetite starts kicking in again. She's already chewed her way thru the school's foreign-exchange student; the huge, burly, but touchingly sensitive linebacker; and the aforementioned goth boy; but now she sets her sights on Needy's cute, shaggy-haired sweetheart Chip (Johnny Simmons) — just in time for the prom. So you're thinking Carrie, right? Wrong.The script by Oscar winner Diablo Cody doesn't crackle with originality as did her breakthru work in Juno, but neither is it full of the tired clichés of the genre. Remember that great scene from Jurassic Park when the T. Rex is chasing the Jeep and by rights the characters and audience should be completely terrified, but Spielberg cuts to the view subtitled ""Objects in mirror are closer than they appear""? There's a moment like that in this film when, in the midst of carnage and danger, one character pauses to reflect on the difference between flying and levitation. The script is constantly inventive and, while not exactly subverting the horror-movie formula, shows us that there might be more life left in the old corpse than we'd imagined.",Jennifer's Body
110,colinrgeorge,"Pick An Audience, Any Audience",5,30 May 2010,"I could give just about any opinion on ""Jennifer's Body"" and it would make a pretty good pun, but I'll try to resist. Instead, it's fair to begin by saying my expectations for the film were easily exceeded, in that it is, in fact, a competently executed and arranged sequence of images. Still, that's about as far as my praise will carry it, with its patchwork of languid, derivative scares and generally unconvincing attempts at humor.The film, directed by Karen Kusama, who's fast making estrogen her calling card with a body of work that includes ""Girlfight,"" ""Aeon Flux,"" and an episode of ""The L Word,"" never quite succeeds for a couple of reasons, but little of which Kusama can directly be said to be at fault for. The problems, admittedly, start with 'Diablo' and end in 'Cody.'It's not that I'm one of the Oscar-winning screenwriter's snide detractors, still saddling a grudge from the ""Juno"" days. I liked ""Juno."" But ""Juno"" was indie, and hoo boy did it know it was indie. It was so indie some more cynical critics choked on it. ""Jennifer's Body,"" however, dabbles dangerously in camp, which can be a particularly wily beast to tame. Everything Cody attempts in her screenplay was more successfully achieved in Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me to Hell,"" Brian De Palma's ""Carrie,"" and John Fawcett's ""Ginger Snaps"" while I'm at it.The issue of its target audience is a curious one, as the themes Cody tackles and the ages of the entire principal cast firmly suggest high-school, but the R-rating indicates otherwise. Curiously though, ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't a hard R, with minimal conventional gore, some swearing, and no nudity to speak of. Everything about the film screams PG-13, and with so little seemingly standing in the way of that rating, it's peculiar that this was the cut released. Even on the verge of Halloween season, the film will likely struggle to find an audience.The precedent set by recent horror/comedy hybrids like ""Gindhouse"" or ""Drag Me to Hell"" also points to public apathy for Kusama's latest, but in this case they really aren't missing much. Megan Fox (""Transformers"") stars as Jennifer Check, who drags her BFF, ""Needy Lesnicky"" (Charles Dickens Cody ain't), portrayed by ""Big Love's"" Amanda Seyfried, to a bar where the two catch the attention of an evil indie band that, mistaking them for virgins, abduct Jennifer as sacrifice in their satanic ritual for superstardom.The ritual, revealed in flashback later on, makes for undoubtedly the film's funniest sequence. The tone is dark and pitch-perfect as the band members squabble over trivialities while preparing her last rites. It's a tone that's conspicuously and unfortunately absent in the rest of the script. Regardless, because Jennifer is ""not even a back-door virgin,"" the sacrifice goes awry, transforming the high-school hottie into a bloodthirsty succubus.Campy one-liners are about the extent of the rest of the movie's humor, which is never exactly groundbreaking stuff, and when combined with the ho-hum horror, make ""Jennifer's Body"" a thoroughly acceptable film that does nothing particularly well. Kusama's direction is solid and the performances of her cast are impressive for a group of up-and-comers, especially Johnny Simmons (no relation to J.K., who also stars) as Needy's boyfriend, Chip. Regrettably, their work is undermined by Diablo Cody's ultimately uninteresting story.Cody's pop-culture tentacles flail in every direction, but the failure of her script is in its aggressive precociousness and lack of commitment to either wood grain horror or outright parody. Effective campy horror is a tightrope to be sure, one that neither the writer nor the director is quite capable of crossing. Their film is a mishmash of insubstantial storytelling and unimpressive showmanship that doesn't quite know who it's talking to.Some may find it attractive, but as far as I'm concerned, ""Jennifer's Body"" is a bit too thin.",Jennifer's Body
111,Spaceygirl,Why did I bother?,1,12 November 2010,"I stopped watching ""What lies beneath"", an above- average chiller to watch this. What was I thinking? ""Jennifer's Body"" is shallow and crude, with not a single redeeming feature. I was curious as to why it was so bad so I googled it. Written by Diablo Cody. Ah, that explains it then. The same person who wrote the insipid and vapid and yet vastly overrated ""Juno"". It doesn't help that it is a star vehicle for Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried and Adam Brody who have to be the most untalented trio in Hollywood. Megan Fox in particular is truly awful. The premise is the most basic and there are several badly judged scenes. It's just so bad.",Jennifer's Body
112,Siamois,Jennifer's Body is insubstantial...,3,30 December 2009,"On a commercial level, you could see this film was a great idea and was going to make money. You take an attractive actress who is currently the talk of the business, and have the person behind the overrated Juno write a generic horror at school movie that mixes staples of 80s horror with with a dash of lame geek-speak in the vein of Joss Whedon. Then wrap this up with a poster featuring sexy Megan Fox and you are guaranteed some money back.The quality is something else, however. Karyn Kusama does the usual polished job of uninspired modern directors. It all looks pretty but there's no intent or purpose behind the scenes. Cinematography, editing, use of music... it's all vanilla-flavoured.Of course, a French kiss between the two female leads is guaranteed to make some people talk and make a few more desperate souls watch this mess, but the actual story, the actual film? Not really worth your time I'm afraid. The genres listed on IMDb for this movie are Comedy | Horror | Thriller and encapsulate why this film is a failure.

Jennifer's Body is a showcase for one thing, Megan Fox's body, which I might add is nice but sadly can't pull off a whole movie by itself unless it was porn. The premise of the story is not very original, tons of blood, some sort of mystery killer who we all see doing all the killings and a lot, and I mean a lot of slow motion.Amanda Seyfried is good with little to work with but Megan puts in her usual pouty zombie performance that has gotten very dull.

OK, there are some nice films where the supernatural is involved as a carrier of fun and humor . Promising at the beginning, Jennifer's body shows soon, that no one in this movie is able to rescue it. It is nearly humorless at all, is bumpy directed, and finally sloppy cut. It is too slow, too serious and by the way too dumb. And that's pretty uncool even for the assumed target audience. Maybe director Karyn Kusama tried her best to rescue the movie from the lame script, but it's nearly impossible to believe that she also directed the fast and artistic Aeon Flux. It's like if John Woo made a Columbo episode. Maybe Kasuma wasn't in the right mood or this is simply not her genre. The two main actors did also not very well, i sensed not much chemistry between the two girls, their implied homo-erotic relationship can not come to life, but certainly that's also in the directors responsibility. After viewing Jennifer's Body, whose body is actually worth making a movie about, I had to watch 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' for more sense of humor. I also recommend 'Night of the Living Dorks', a very black comedy from Germany, if you can get it in your country with subtitles.Conclusion: Countless wasted opportunities, most in the script, many in the directing.

115,blacklist-1,A silly but surprisingly enjoyable teen comedy horror.,6,5 November 2009,"Megan Fox stars as the antagonist in Jennifer's body as a girl whose a vampire and eats boys in order to survive. Her best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried) who is the protagonist has to protect them including her boyfriend.This is an entertaining movie all round and is not meant to be taken seriously. It dosen't start off great though as some of the acting is shockingly wooden in places namely Seyfried as there is a situation when a bar catches on fire where her reaction to it is not certifiable (She dosen't act horrified and anyone would!)The script isn't great either and overall the film gives the impression of silliness. Having saying that the movie does get better as it goes along and Megan Fox is back on form from her terrible acting in Transformers,(which wasn't entirely her fault as she had very little to do).In Jennifer's body she has the aura of sexy and seductiveness to seduce the boys, but she's not just eye candy in this, she has more to do and her acting is much better.However Seyfried steals the show with her acting as most of it is really good providing a tone of awkwardness around her boyfriend particular in a surprisingly sweet love scene between them but the inner fiestiness to stop Jennifer.Director Karyn Kusama skillfully mixes the black comic with the horror namely the violence, which is quite gruesome and there is some nice scenes, a couple of touching ones.And don't worry boys there is the sumptuous girl on girl kiss between Seyfried and Fox, which is not just a peck on the cheek. It's really put in there for the sake of it but I don't think there will be any complaints about that. Near the ending is interesting when you find out how Jennifer became a vampire, which will make you feel some sympathy for her and the actual ending itself has a small surprise twist, which you may see coming but it was still good to have.Overall Jennifer's body isn't a brilliant film but it's certainly not bad and I would recommend seeing it.

116,larry-411,Deliciously decadent hybrid of teen sex comedy & horror,9,22 September 2009,"I attended the World Premiere of ""Jennifer's Body"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Diablo Cody (as screenwriter) reunites with Jason Reitman (as producer) on this film -- he directed and she wrote 2007's ""Juno"" -- and it proves to be another successful collaboration. Director Karyn Kusama takes the helm.Story always comes first in a genre film but the acting does not take a back seat. The teens' awkward attempts at first love will no doubt resonate with viewers. Megan Fox is strong and sure as a temptress on top of her game. Johnny Simmons is the clueless submissive one. It's a reversal of roles from the typical teen comedy. He impressed me in ""The Greatest"" as the vulnerable younger sibling in a family dealing with the loss of an older child. In both roles, his innocence does the talking and provides much of the comic relief. Adam Brody (The O.C.) is frighteningly creepy as a rock star with an evil secret. Amanda Seyfried (Alpha Dog, Big Love) proves once again that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. Chris Pratt (Everwood, The O.C.) and Kyle Gallner (The Haunting in Connecticut) also turn in sharp performances.This deliciously decadent teen comedy/horror flick has the look and feel of a big Hollywood movie, with its bigger-than-""Juno"" budget allowing for greater production values, including a killer soundtrack that is spot on. State of the art visual and special effects combine with M. David Mullen's extraordinary cinematography to put this film right in the center of its target audience. ""Jennifer's Body"" is a curious hybrid of several genres. Themes of female empowerment and sexuality dominate the obvious horror story. Dialogue and action combine effectively, with neither overriding the other.",Jennifer's Body
117,repojack,Better than you remembered,7,9 February 2021,"To be honest, I didn't have fond memories of Jennifer's Body first time around. I think at the time I subconsciously discounted Megan Fox's performance given her role in the mostly forgettable Transformers and that was a mistake.It's easy to be distracted by Fox given she was sexualized from the very beginning, but both she and Amanda Seyfried are absolutely excellent in this.There's something deeper going on within story which I'm not going to even try to analyze or express. If someone wants to start a discussion around this in the comments I'll try to contribute some of my thoughts.So for now I'll play it safe and give a shoutout to the soundtrack. There were so many good songs on here including:* Kiss with a Fist (Florence + The Machine)
* Death (White Lies)
* Violet (Hole) in an incredible credits scene.And that KISS! I can't remember a more erotic kiss, gay or heterosexual, in the thousands of movies I've seen.There are so many interesting things going on in this horror-comedy that elevate Jennifer's Body rom just being another teenage splatter fest.",Jennifer's Body
118,utahman1971,One of the better horror flicks,10,9 January 2010,"This was very good to me. I saw it in the theater, and now I got it on DVD unrated version.It starts off talking with ""Needy"" in a mental institute. She explains on how she got there. It goes into the movie with her starting with how she was Best Friends Forever with Jennifer (Megan Fox). Megan Fox is hot, but their is one thing that would turn me away from her, is her jacked up thumbs. Anyways Megan is a Demon that has been brought back from a ritual of a non popular band ""Low Shoulder"" that played in a local bar. The only bar in town. It burns down while they are playing their only song made. After the band and Jennifer, Needy get out safely from the fire. Jennifer decides to join the band in their van, not knowing what will happen to her. Needy stays away and goes home.As far as Needy is concerned she knew something might happen to Jennifer. Well, Jennifer was sacrificed in the woods by the band. The band thought she was a virgin for the sacrifice, but they were wrong. Well, Jennifer did not die she came back as a cannibalism demon that eats boys for her to stay pretty. Pretty much Jennifer is only still around and living to eat boys is because Needy and Jennifer are BFF. Once Needy kills Jennifer and pulls off the necklace she wears that says BFF on it she is dead.This has great gore, but for the unrated version on DVD, you can't tell the difference from the theater or extended version. So I do not know why they even call it unrated. No difference. I don't mind a little lesbian action, but Needy was a turn off with it. Needy was not attractive at all for it.

If you use all the money, technology and film knowledge to make such a stupid movie, then you really got to change the profession. This film insults intelligence of every person that has IQ over 30. I believe it is a general insult even for a 5 year old kid. It shows no imagination and no creativity at all, just copying every film of the genre that has been made until now, making the most stupid film mishmash that I have seen in a year. This is a very sad time for Hollywood. I remember the times when you could really enjoy products of this movie factory.

Some great shots, atmosphere, and special affects.Story:
I really liked the plot of this film, all the way from beginning to end. It is very interesting and isnt something I've seen before in the genre. Some of the scenes could be better and same with some cringey acting but it doesnt let the film down to much.Summary:
This film is coming on over 10 years old now, and it still is a great watch. I remember watching it when it came out and loved it, and just last week watched it again and still enjoyed it. I would definently recommend this film, I'll probably remember it till the day I die.",Jennifer's Body
121,Jonathon_Natsis,"Unlike Megan, it's uncomfortable to watch and unwelcome in my house.",3,2 February 2011,"Besides the obvious appeal of Megan Fox appearing in what was marketed as a play on the horror/torture porn genre, I tried to keep an open mind with Jennifer's Body after learning it was penned by Diablo Cody, an extremely talented prospect of a screenwriter who has only recently made the transition to film. Unfortunately, nobody really hits the mark in what could have been a very refreshing and unique film.The plot is expectedly simple. Resident teen queen Jennifer Check is used as a sacrifice for a rock band's satanic ritual, but a failure to complete the sacrifice properly results in Jen's body becoming occupied by a demon. Feasting on the men of the small country town is the only way for the demon to repel imminent death, and so it's up to Jen's nerdy friend (the aptly- named Needy) to stop her.For a film that could have had so much appeal, almost every aspect of it stumbles through each individual scene. Relatively unknown director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight, Aeon Flux) is slowly building a reputation as a genuine feminist of filmmaking; female protagonists, a thematic focus on girl-girl relationships, and all sorts of other things us men can't even begin to understand. While there is nothing wrong with that, she fails to give the film its appropriate direction. The cinematography and camera-work (while competent) feels lazy, and completely devoid of a motivation to give this film a self-reflexive undertone.Self-reflexive? Don't look away; I'm not using Extension English buzz words just to sound clever. I'm actually onto something. This was always meant to be a film to parody the horror genre not just through visible humour, but also by putting a new spin on its typical conventions. The problem arises when it becomes apparent that this film takes itself too seriously to be considered a parody. As a result, the viewer dosen't look at a scene or a piece of dialogue thinking 'That's clevernobody's done that before'. Instead, it simply appears poorly constructed, occasionally endeavouring to be too clever for its own good.A large part of this failure to convey satire lies with writer Diablo Cody. Receiving a deserved Oscar for her Juno script, she attempts to replicate that award-winning style of 'hipster' dialogue in Jennifer's Body, complete with an abundance of teenage colloquialisms (some contemporary, some missing the mark altogether). As with the cinematography, the script dosen't fit the required tone, and isn't helped by Cody going over-the-top with her pop culture references and questionable word choice. On a positive note, Cody is most certainly an individual when it comes to writing, not unlike the talent possessed by early-90s Quentin Tarantino, when raw and real characters, not merely cinematic exploitation, dictated his films. Her style can turn out some fantastically innovative scenes, but needs to find an appropriate context in which to do so, and the subject matter of this film does not accommodate.Could I keep going? Absolutely. But I think you get the idea by now, you're all pretty smart. So I'll wrap it up. I'm not a player hater. As mentioned, I believe Cody to be an extremely talented writer. I also thought Megan Fox's acting was above average in this film, while Amanda Seyfried (best known as the dumb one from Mean Girls) is the shining light in a disappointing final product. Uncomfortable and unsuitable dialogue, lack of direction, and a dismal ending intended to set up a sequel are the biggest pitfalls of Jennifer's Body; a prime example of a film with infinite potential being placed in the wrong hands.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",Jennifer's Body

123,TheMovieDoctorful,The Tragedy of Megan Fox,10,8 November 2018,"Jennifer's Body depresses me. It doesn't depress me because of its more tragic aspects, as the film has plenty of levity. It certainly doesn't depress me because of a supposed lack of quality, as I consider the film easily one of the best Horror movies of the 2000s. Jennifer's Body depresses me because of how people reacted to it. How the marketing framed an LGBT Horror film directly for the consumption of men. How geek culture pre-emptively trashed the film solely for its leading actress, the notoriously angry, non-conformist, anti-Conservative and non-compliant Megan Fox. How male ""feminists"" sl*t shamed Megan Fox in reviews and trashed the film's fans as nothing but horny morons. That stuff gets under my skin. That stuff pisses me off. And for good reason, as the film we ended up getting is absolutely fantastic.For all the disgusting hate that Megan Fox got thrown at her from insecure geek-bros, her performance as Jennifer Check is nothing short of extraordinary. She displays a surprising amount of self awareness that her critics never gave her credit for and pitch perfect comedic timing. Even more unexpected is just how convincing she is as a villain. Fox's all-too-knowing facial expressions and toying line delivery create a character that's convincingly manipulative, cunning, sadistic, ruthless and even scary. She has an evil smile that I swear rivals Tim Curry's. Fox also does a wonderful job playing to the more human side of her character in moments while still keeping the character in an overall unsympathetic light. If the film wasn't as impressive as it was, I'd say she carried the show.Amanda Seyfried does excellent work in her own right as Needy Lesnicki. She's a charming, likable, funny, adorkable, an upbeat presence and a very convincing heroine and Seyfried does a wonderful job conveying her power, stubbornness and intellect. She's a very worthy final girl if ever I've seen one and the incredible screen presence she captures makes me wonder why she hasn't done more Horror films. It's also worth mentioning that her post-incarceration switch from High School sweetheart to violent harpy was hilarious, satisfying and beyond credible, and her chemistry with Megan Fox is off the charts.I can't think of a single bad performance in this film, come to mention it. Adam Brody is arguably the most effective comedic presence in the movie, retaining an odd sense of likability despite being totally irredeemable as a character in every way. Kyle Gallner is a dorky, adorable and lovable delight in his minor role, he does a wonderful job portraying Chip's innocence and makes for a character we genuinely don't want to see bite the dust. J.K Simmons, while admittedly underused, works magic as quirky, Midwestern teacher Mr. Wroblewski. I wasn't a fan of Johnny Simmons' Colin at first (Though that may have been the filmmaker's intent. He's written as somewhat emotionally neglectful to his girlfriend, Needy, who shares far more chemistry with Jennifer. Their ""sandbox love"" holds a sincerity, honesty and, above all, passion to it that the dynamic of Chip and Needy sorely lacks.), but he really steps up his game near the end to help redeem his previously unsympathetic character with a rather heroic sacrifice. This is an extremely well acted movie.Critics of the film like to dismiss the idea that this is a ""feminist movie"" based on Megan Fox's character taking the role of The Seductress', but they seem to miss one very important detail; Jennifer is not the symbol of female empowerment in the film. Needy is. Jennifer Check embodies what a patriarchal society superficially tells us a strong woman is. She's sexual (For the purposes of attracting males), she's callous, she's destroys men. However, these behaviors are all done out of insecurity. Out of Jennifer's desire to be embraced. She doesn't act the way she does to be empowered, she acts the way she does because this is how she's told to act. Needy Lesnicki, on the other hand, is what an actual empowered woman is in ways that are meaningful; she's proactive, she's highly intelligent, she's emotionally strong, she's confident in her own sexuality without being pressured into one direction or the other, she's stubborn and a non-conformist to the values of others. Finally, unlike Jennifer, she is not dependent on others. She is entirely her own person. The entire film is surrounded upon the discarding of masks, the revelation that it is in fact Jennifer, the sexy and all-powerful man eater, who is the weak one, and Needy, the awkward and seemingly shrinking violet, who is the strong one. If there's one thing I don't hate about the marketing in this film, it's that it helps to subvert your expectations on the true strong, independent, female character of the film.Everything about the aesthetic of this film is glorious. It's bright, neon color scheme is beautiful and gives a very stark femininity to the atmosphere, while also feeling like a stylistic callback to the teen Horror films of the 90s that the film wishes to embody. The musical score sets a truly eerie and unsettling feeling to the film, while still feeling confidently modern and, again, deeply feminine. The cinematography is both frightening and gorgeous, some of the imagery feeling almost reminiscent of Gothic horror. (Particularly memorable is a scene of an unfocused Jennifer stalking Chip, her white dress flowing in the howling wind, as if she were a Bride of Dracula.)Yes, in conclusion, Jennifer's Body depresses me. However, with the film's cult fanbase sprouting around a year ago and only growing with age, there is certainly hope. This is a movie with a lot of merit in multiple fields and much to say on femininity, celebrity worship, media exploitation of tragedies and sexuality and there's too much to unpackage here for it to remain a black sheep. I doubt I'll be depressed thinking about Kusama and Cody's feminist masterpiece in the near future.",Jennifer's Body

The only credit I'm giving is to Amanda Seyfried(Needy) and Johnny Simmons(Chip), their acting was top notch and also the only reason why I didn't turn this atrocity off in the first 10 minutes.

126,jaddison383,The Incompletion of Great Premise...,7,2 October 2009,"When Jennifer's Body was first announced to me, I met the idea with cautious curiosity. The idea of Megan Fox playing an evil high school beauty queen who eats the boys she seduces sounded... interesting, to say the least. When the trailer finally emerged, I got excited. Seriously. The combination of thrilling and funny hadn't been explored well at the theater in a long time.Unfortunately, it still hasn't been explored well; at least not very well. The movie understands what it's going for: a comic horror film with just enough gore and jumps to be jarring and plenty of witty dialogue to stay fresh. The problem is, the two don't seem to meld together very well at any point. It's hard to say whether this has more to do with Diablo Cody's script or Karyn Kusama's direction; neither is at it's full potential here. Although, on recollection of the film, the too-random use of humor sometimes seems to have been the biggest problem.But let's talk about what works. The leads are both very good. It was Megan Fox who got lots of good buzz about proving she could actually act, but Amanda Seyfried really impressed me more with her edgy role. The performances of both are worthy of accolades. They bring honesty and realism to what could have become total caricatures, and their performances help paint the deeper themes of the movie quite well.Yes, there are deeper themes. It's not too hard to spot what Ms. Cody is trying to talk about here: The relationships girls have with each other. The whole 'Frenemies' idea that so defines high school girls. It's an interesting concept to examine, and it could have made for a truly entertaining AND thoughtful film.But it simply isn't. While it wants to get there, it gets too lost in trying to be hip and current and 'alternative' to really become a film. And while the tension builds decently toward the finale, it all leads up to a climax that... doesn't really climax.However, this is not to say Jennifer's Body isn't worth watching. Hell, I was entertained, and there are some sexy little scenes in there. The disappointment lies in thinking about what the premise promised, a promise that sadly wasn't quite fulfilled... 6/10 stars Jay Addison",Jennifer's Body

130,ray-280,Megan Fox Is STILL The Second Sexiest Woman On Earth,5,21 October 2009,"Whither Megan Fox? My ""secret"" got out, and I feel like a guy who told the paper about his favorite lunch spot, only to have them run an article that drove so much business there that I can't even get a seat at my old table. FHM and Maxim may have only gotten a clue this year, but they aren't the only two mags with ""Top 100"" lists.In 2005, I compiled my own little list, and listed the Megan Fox that Michael Bay thought ""no one had ever heard of"" as #2 on my list of ""Top 100 Sexiest Famous Women In America,"" which I published on my website. This was based on her super-sexy, and super-SMART performance in Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen. That the role left an impression on no one else didn't matter; I'm a guy, and know world-class sexy when I see it. Did Megan Fox CARE that I ranked here there? Of course not. She did, however, hit up one of the big magazines' hot-100 parties, as a reward for their being three years behind the internet, and a list created specifically to ""scoop"" the ""big lists."" Mission accomplished on all counts.Fast-forward to now, and EVERYONE sees what I saw in 2005. Was Megan Fox UGLY back then? No. Then why was she OFF these lists entirely? The media just brainwashes men into confusing fame with being hot, and now she has both, so it's easier to see her physical supremacy. I can't even fantasize about her anymore without feeling like the whole world is watching. Tsk. For those who care, in 2005 the woman I ranked at #1 was Chrishell Stausse, a newcomer to All My Children who is still going strong, and who is about as sexy as Fox, but without the fame (yet). I figure that scoop is forthcoming around 2012.This is relevant to Jennifer's Body because Megan Fox is still the *second* sexiest ""famous"" woman in America, and now she has made the *second* sexiest horror film ever. Like Fox herself was in 2005, an unknown talent, in an unknown internet film, trumped this big-studio attempt at an ""abreactive mind-control"" horror film, in every category.The film is called ""hypnothings."" It can be found on the internet, from a producer named Kismet. It contains genuine hypnosis, of an extremely sexy nature, with the lead actress using the exact ""bambi"" voice that Fox spoke of using for her character, only to produce a much stronger (actual hypnosis) reaction in the viewer, if the viewer chooses to go under. The actress from hypnothings, Marta McGonagle (now a rising star of her own), is hotter than Megan Fox. Her voice is sexier than Megan Fox, and she has even more of a ""supernatural power"" over men, like the one Fox brags of. McGonagle is superior to Fox in every way, shape and form, but the two of them are superior to the rest of the world, by a much larger margin. Hypnothings (if you go under to it) is way superior to Jennifer's Body (which is of the ""implied"" nature that Hollywood loves to mail it in with) is less cerebral, with less of an impact on the viewer. The plots are not identical, but the psychological space in which the lead actress took herself in each film, is.That McGonagle languishes in obscurity, while Fox is ""#1 sexy"" is a crime against nature. Put her in ANY role claimed by Fox, and she would do just as well, if not better. She's just SEXIER, but, like Fox in 2005, unless she's on the Big Media radar, the public will not become aware of her, and that's sad. Everything Megan Fox wishes she were, Marta McGonagle already IS, just like Fox was as hot, if not hotter, back in 2005, than she is now. Fox also thinks she is ""controversial,"" or ""cutting edge,"" but by internet standards, she has mainstreamed herself into a lame joke by comparison, one in which she has become her own punch line. Fox herself is too busy for much of an internet presence, or maybe she knows that she's not cut out for this jungle, where the pay is lower, the hours are longer, the work is more true to art than business, and where ""implied sexy"" no longer cuts it.If Fox thinks her ""deadly Bambi"" voice is seductively deadly, she should check out a copy of Hypnothings sometime. McGonagle already ran for a touchdown with that ball, while Fox barely made it to the first-down market. Here you have two actresses, with essentially the same looks, doing essentially the same things, and the same fame/income imbalance that plagues the entertainment industry as a whole, and will continue to do so until Hollywood is finally done spending yesterday's money, and goes broke, forcing its ""A-list"" to begin to seek work out here.",Jennifer's Body
131,Mike_Noga,Go for the demonically possessed cannibal cheerleader but stay for the....well...demonically possessed cannibal cheerleader,3,28 January 2010,"I'll get the big questions out of the way right away.1. No, you do not see anymore of Megan Fox than you could see at any public beach (or behind the Beverly Hills 7-11 for a dollar) and 2. Yes there is a brief make-out scene between Megan and Amanda Sieyfried, although I think they used stunt tongues.There that should take care of most of the people who are interested in this movie. Unfortunately, if you are interested in this movie because of its screen writing pedigree, well, you're going to be disappointed. It's the ""anti-Juno"" in all the worst ways.Megan Fox plays Jennifer, a gorgeous, shallow somewhat condescending and manipulative prom queen type. Amanda Seyfried plays ""Needy"" her nerdy but deep best friend. One night through a combination of bad judgment and blind ambition, Jennifer is sacrificed to the devil, but resurrected with the spirit of a demon in her body. (I think) She needs to eat a male every so often to sustain herself and it isn't long before some of the local lads begin to lose their hearts to Jennifer, literally. Needy starts to put 2 and 2 together and figures out something isn't right with her friend, what with her(Jennifer) constantly showing up covered in blood and bile. When demon Jennifer goes after Needy's sainted boyfriend, well that makes it personal! I've read that this movie is supposed to be a metaphor for why teen-age girls use sex to validate themselves. I guess you could say that, although I've seen the same theme handled much better on many a TV sitcom. Seriously, if Blossom or even iCarly vomited a little more blood they'd have this movie beat all to hell. There are of course a few clever parts. There are a few funny digs against the music industry and a little snazzy writing. But the metaphors and insights are pretty ham-fisted. I probably wouldn't judge it so harshly if Diablo Cody hadn't written it, but she did, and for better or for worse people expect better of her. I think she wrote the screenplay on the can while she was taking a break from writing her ""real"" Oscar contending screenplay yet to come.This is pretty standard horror stuff, and a bit uninspired at that. There are a few scares and creepy parts, but that aspect is nothing special. You'd think a writer named Diablo would know more about horror movies and devil worship. But then again you'd think an Oscar winning screenwriter could come up with something better for her Oscar follow-up. There's nothing wrong with her choice of topic. If she had just made a fun, sharp, scary little movie that would have been a fine choice. But this movie is neither fun nor sharp nor scary. Aside from some good, solid acting by Amanda Seyfried and JK Simmons, who is pretty funny as the ""square"" science teacher who is representative of the ineffective school system, this movie isn't worth more than a rental fee. Jennifer's body may be near perfect, but her shenanigans just aren't that interesting.",Jennifer's Body
132,dudedazzreviews,Not fantastic but I've seen worse,6,10 October 2010,"As I liked what I saw in the trailer and Megan Fox, I decided to watch this movie and I ended up liking it. I can honestly say that some will and won't find it disappointing. A geeky friend called Needy (Amanda Seyfried) and hot cheerleader Jennifer (Megan Fox) are the best of friends even though they both don't share the same interests with each other. They have even less in common when Jennifer becomes possessed and has a thirst for human blood after a mysterious fire at a bar one night. When the males of the school fall under her charms and kills them gruesomely, Needy must try and save the males and stop Jennifer from killing before she kills Needy's boyfriend.So Jennifer's Body may not be the type of movie to take a girl out on a date to see but it is quite good for a teen horror-slash-comedy movie. The story is mediocre which would be expected in this type of movie but the witty one-liners all the way through the movie make up for it. Character development was timed correctly in the movie and also the cinematic relationship between Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried was believable and great to watch as an on-screen duo. The acting was actually quite good and I thought the cast worked very well for the movie. I also liked the music from movie-band Low Shoulder.I would say that the story is actually decent but I thought the ending almost spoilt the movie entirely as it was just ridiculous, you'll see what I mean if you see it.

I see it as this generation's ""Fright Night,"" in that you have a small town, and a monster comes rolling in, and the protagonist of the story knows what's going on, and nobody believes her. Megan Fox was pretty good in this. I can see why a lot of people don't really like her style of acting, but it works for this film. Amanda Seyfried is marvelous.

137,misbegotten,An under-rated coming-of-age/horror teen movie,7,3 July 2010,"JENNIFER'S BODY was a surprise box office flop in America, but I confidently predict that it will find it's audience on DVD and in a few years' time have a healthy cult reputation. As the titular character, Megan Fox has been dismissed by many as a flavour-of-the-month sex symbol who can't act and owes her career purely to her looks, but personally I thought she was fine in the role. It might not be a standout performance, but Fox delivers everything that the part requires. However, it's Jennifer's best friend 'Needy' who's the true lead character, and as played by the talented Amanda Seyfried (who first caught my attention in MEAN GIRLS) she provides the movie with it's emotional centre. The script by former-stripper-turned-writer Diablo Cody (whose breakthrough hit JUNO I confess I've not seen) is filled with witty, cutting edge teen-speak and clever, waspish put-downs, and while repeatedly quotable it occasionally strains too hard in it's attempts to be cool.If you're looking for metaphors, in my opinion the movie is really about how the physical, emotional and psychological changes that we undergo in our teenage years alter us to the extent that within a few months or even weeks we can permanently drift away from childhood friends we've known for years and previously been extremely close to. The film also touches upon how the innocent, physically-expressed affection and love between young female friends can sometimes become borderline-sexual when teen hormones begin to kick in and – whether they've started to show an interest in boys or not – they try to make sense of their awakening sexuality. The Sapphic subtext between Jennifer and Needy is actually nicely underplayed and quite touching, despite the director not being able to resist playing to the gallery and filming a kiss between the two of them in extreme close-up.No movie is perfect, and JENNIFER'S BODY loses a few points by resorting to the lazy cliché of having Needy wear glasses to signify that she's a nerdy bookworm. And although it's standard practice in Hollywood to have twenty-somethings play teenagers, Fox unfortunately stands out from the rest of the cast by looking precisely like what she is – a 23 year old pretending to be a high school student. It's not her fault and as I've written above, she gives a solid and more-than-competent performance. She's just miscast. The film also dodges the CARRIE-style prom massacre climax that it's clearly building towards, probably for budgetary reasons. But otherwise JENNIFER'S BODY is an accomplished effort and a pleasant surprise, much better than it's U.S. failure would have you expect.",Jennifer's Body
138,petit76,a great spew of black goo scene that is enough to call this movie ''scary'',6,16 September 2009,"I'll admit to not being very excited to see Jennifer's Body on first look. Coming as a fast-tracked script, hot on the heels of Diablo Cody's successful debut Juno, it just looked rushed, abused, and left for dead. After the production house Fox Atomic folded and dissolved back into its parent, the future did not look bright. However, being a teen horror flick starring Megan Fox had to all but assure it a theatrical release of some sort. And here it is at the Toronto Film Festival as part of the Midnight Madness series. I had hoped to view it in that atmosphere and the spectacle it would become, but instead had to settle for a press screening during the day with about five other attendees rather than the rowdy sellout crowd including Fox herself. Thankfully though, the film didn't need a circus to make it fun, it does it all by itself. Camp galore and intentional unintentional laughter help make up for any shortcomings to the horror genre on the whole. But then isn't a complete sub genre created around fun, pop culture, and absurdity? If I've learned anything from this film it is that you never sacrifice a non-virgin to the devil when only a virgin can do the trick  it's just not done people. If any credit can be given to Cody—despite the very hyper-tween dialogue that was cute in Juno, but eventually more and more annoying, especially here—it is in the inventive creativity used on the whole ""sell your soul to the devil"" idea. Usually when a ritual act of that kind is committed, bad things happen to those that signed the contract. Here, however, through an occult loophole, the botched deal causes a rift in dimensions and leaves a possessed cheerleader out for human flesh. Because, honestly, what's better when needing to clear up blemishes, liven your hair, and add a little glow to your cheeks then blood? In perfect casting, that of a not-so-talented actress in Megan Fox, Cody's dialogue fits right at home with the campiness as well. Fox's delivery is so tongue-in-cheek that whether or not she'd have acted the same if trying to be serious, the role is on the money. Seductive, sarcastic, and deadly, Jennifer's body is indeed a lethal weapon.It is not just the somewhat tired devil angle being flipped on its head that's the only surprise, though, nor is it the fact that I had a good time with a ""bad"" film. The cast is full of memorable cameos as well as effective leads, the blood and gore never go too crazy and oftentimes occur off screen with only the result shown, and the storytelling structure successfully is book marked with moments that take place after the bulk of the action. The story is actually a retelling of what happened by the true star of the film Needy, played by Amanda Seyfried. Here is a mousy little girl that is best friends with the hottest and most popular high schooler in their sleepy town. She has an equally geeky boyfriend and wardrobe, but the sandbox history with Jennifer to keep her ""cool kid"" cred alive. This is the Needy we are introduced to in the trailer, but most definitely not the one we see in the opening scene. No, that one is a stone-cold kicker, locked inside a mental institution/prison, scars over her body and fan mail/gifts flowing in. The film isn't about Fox's titular Jennifer and her demonic possession; it's about Seyfried's Needy and how such a sweet girl could become so utterly bad-ass.With a whole cast of people having a good time hamming things up, there are always a couple standouts. Not counting a fun cameo by genre vet Lance Henriksen, the performances by Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, and Adam Body beg mention. Young Simmons is a precisely calculated bundle of nerves and awkwardness playing Needy's boyfriend Chip. He epitomizes the naive boy stumbling on his words and left without a backbone when Jennifer comes to steal his girl away to attend a concert at a bar outside of town. The elder Simmons actually showcases many of the same insecurities as a teacher. Pulling off his best George Segal look, this role is the exact opposite to the usual boisterous and outspoken characters we are used to watching him play. But the guy that steals the show, and every scene he is in, has to be Adam Brody. The kid just exudes charisma and possesses impeccable comic timing as the prick lead singer of Low Shoulder, a band who's single is played everywhere and becomes a sort of unofficial anthem for the town after a freak fire burns down the club they play at, along with many of the townies in attendance.And it is that scene which characterizes the tone of the film. So random and so surreal, the bar is burning to the ground, people are screaming and running around in flames, yet Fox and Seyfried are watching it all while Brody nonchalantly tells them how happy he is that they got out. Carnage left and right, he just offers a drink and an invitation to his van. The juxtaposition is so outrageous that it works completely, as do all the other moments of absurd hilarity. Because, you see, Jennifer's Body is not out to reign supreme in the slasher or psychological terror bins of horror; it strictly wants to have fun while serving up a nice helping of blood and dismemberment. Don't take anything seriously—and honestly, how could you—ignore the nails-on-a-chalkboard dialogue, (""I'm not jealous"" ""You are so Jello, you are lime green Jello), and just let the camp consume you. Complete with a pretty decent rock compilation soundtrack and end credits montage with a pretty great epilogue to the party, all involved play it right and never take anything seriously. That's a good thing. Evren Buyruk",Jennifer's Body
139,shannen-l-c,A cliche teen scream that ticks all the boxes,8,17 February 2018,"As a huge horror fan people seem to gasp in surprise when I admit I like (maybe even love) 'Jennifer's Body'. I've tried to wrap my head around the mediocre 5.1 rating it has and the only conclusion I can come to is that people are setting their expectations too high. This movie is not a real contender in the horror genre and loosely plays around with horror rather than fully immersing itself in it. For that reason, this movie isn't the right one for anyone that's looking for a true horror experience. The combination of Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried makes a surprisingly good combination. And whilst we all know Megan Fox is a sub-par actress that gets by on her sexual charisma and good looks, she does bring a vulnerability and hidden depth to Jennifer's character. Although she's initially portrayed as the stereotypical beautiful popular girl that's head cheerleader and the girl all the guys want to date and every other girl wants to be, it's clear that beneath that there's actually a very insecure and confused little girl. Amanda Seyfried's performance as Jennifer's best friend, Needy is fantastic and it's no secret that she carried the movie and was the perfect contrast against Megan's weaker performance. Needy is a sympathetic character who viewers can get on-board with and root for. Despite the insanity of the situation she's propelled into, she handles it with logic and practicality. Sure, the movie is saturated with sex, gore and crack humour cliches you'd expect in a teen flick, but it also has much more to offer. 'Jennfier's Body' has a lot more depth to it than what may be perceived on first appearances. The friendship between the two girls - Jennifer and Needy - is really central to the story and is very representative of the struggles teenage girls go through. The competitiveness, envy, jealousy, loyalty, insecurity, closeness and muddled emotions involved in female/female friendships is explored from many different angles and very reflective of what a lot of girls go through. The characters of Jennifer and Needy themselves are much more complex and multi-layered than a lot of characters in these types of movies. Although she's characterised as a nerd, Needy supersedes that stereotype very early on by proving herself to be very resourceful, witty, intelligent, sweet and relatable. However, by the end of the movie circumstance has forced Needy to become a different person - more violent and tough. As a viewer it's almost impossible not to sympathise with Needy, who for all intents and purposes was an ordinary high school girl that was dragged into a hellish nightmare and had to live with the consequences for the rest of her life. As for Jennifer, although she's largely portrayed as an antagonist and taken as such my a majority of viewers, if you dig a little deeper she's as much of a victim as Needy. Although Jennifer is formulated upon cliche tropes and stereotypes, what's often missed is that Jennifer's sexual appetite in this movie is very much a metaphor for her underlying confusion regarding her own sexuality. The idea of Jennifer being bisexual or gay is played with throughout the movie, but upon rewatching it, it becomes clear that it exists whether it's being spoken about or not. One of the opening lines to the movie is and I quote, ""You're totally lesbi-gay"". The references don't end there. There's mention of Jennifer and Needy playing ""moms and dads"" when they were children, Jennifer's inappropriate jealousy over Needy's relationship with her boyfriend Chip, there's even a kiss between Jennifer and Needy and if that doesn't make it obvious, Jennifer makes a statement at the end that goes something like, ""I go both ways."" Whilst initially all of these references can be passed off as bad stabs at humour, they can also be perceived as much more subtle hints of Jennifer's struggle with her sexuality and feelings towards girls or more specifically, Needy. In ignoring or overlooking these details, the fundamental story of Jennifer's character is misconstrued and she really does come across as the air-headed cheerleader she's presented to us as being. When in reality, her sexual promiscuity, obsession with boys and emphasis on her physicality is just a mask for her underlying issues. Putting the characterisation of Needy and Jennifer aside, the plot of the movie is well paced and develops in a satisfying way. The mystery of what happened to Jennifer isn't unnecessarily dragged out, but the reveal doesn't lessen the intrigue of the story even if it is somewhat predictable. The dialogue is cheesy as hell at times but it elevates the teen-ness of it. Although I wouldn't classify it as being a horror in the traditional sense there are definitely some chilling moments in there (the one that comes to mind takes place in Needy's kitchen, you'll know the one I'm talking about when you see it and the scenes in the van), and if you're able to look past the surface of the dialogue and humour, there's some very serious underlying themes of victim shaming, struggles with self-identity and sexuality, friendship and right vs wrong. Overall, 'Jennifer's Body' is a very satisfying viewing if you're able to scratch beneath the surface, dig deeper and look beyond the overused horror tropes and dry humour.",Jennifer's Body
140,jakerocks,Much better than expected,6,10 October 2021,"Another film that suffered from poor marketing. The trailers and advertising were misleading so I avoided it when it came out.It has a very compelling story along with solid characters. I am not a fan of the super trendy dialogue because it already sounds dated. But a good horror story nonetheless.Better than movies like The Descent, The Witch, The Woods, Raw or Teeth. And I like it better than High Tension. Not as good as Ginger Snaps, Happy Death Day or the original Carrie (1976).",Jennifer's Body
141,madbandit20002000,Boy Crazy. . .and Hungry!,8,26 January 2010,"Longtime friendship are beautiful, funny, fragile and ugly all at once, and ""Jennifer's Body"", a sly but bit limp horror satire that's the sophomore effort of Oscar-winning scribe Diablo Cody (""Juno"") shows that.Sandbox chums since kindergarten, Jennifer Check (Megan Fox of the Transformers films and ""Jonah Hex"") and Anita ""Needy"" Lesnick (Amanda Seyfried of ""Big Love"" and ""Dear John"") are an odd pair since the former is a sharp sexpot and the latter, despite having loyal boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons of ""The Spirit and ""Hotel For Dogs""), is a bookworm mouse. Regardless, the two gals head to a redneck bar, where an struggling indie band, Low Shoulder, is playing. However, the band, lead by the causally snarky Nikolai (Adam Brody, ""The O.C."", ""Cop Out"") are devil worshippers, scouting for a virgin to sacrifice to achieve fortune and fame. Their performance starts a fire in the bar, giving them the opportunity, but they pick Jennifer who's been ""around"". She survives, but becomes a bile-spewing succubus, seducing and eating dumb, hormone-filled boys, and Needy's the only one smart enough to stop her. And people have to worry about STDsThe wit-layered tale by Ms. Cody, who makes a cameo here, is aptly helmed by by Karyn Kusama (""Girlfight"", ""Aeon Flux""), who uses the usual cinematic horror tricks present in American, European and Southeast-Asian productions (dark woods, blood-caked starlets, mutilated corpses, etc). Ms. Cody's nothing but a cheery fangirl for the bloody stuff with a double X chromosome beat. There's also humor. The film's main title credits are in neon pink script, belonging to a 80s teen romance. When Jennifer kills a boy in one scene, it's paralleled with Needy's bloody epiphany while she and Chip have sex. Needy shudders with fear; Chip thinks he's doing a great job!However, the film's hampered by Fox, whose rep as a wet dream goddess to boys, ages eight to eighty, is solid, and that camp may be turned off by her devouring. She's not a serious thespian (yet) because her role is a size too big. Seyfried's ten steps ahead of her, being the only one in the film's setting, Devil's Kettle, that sees b.s. in the community's transparent naivete and angst, post-tragedies. That gives the idea that the script could have rewritten to mimic the starless, yet more impressive ""Teeth"", where a pro-abstinence girl learns her vagina cavity has dentures. Girls, today. . .Other sparks are given by Simmons, who seems older than he looks; Brody, who echoes Jason Lee from ""Dogma"" and Amy Sedaris (""Strangers With Candy"") as Seyfried's hangover-suffering mom. Acting alumni from ""Juno"" include J.K Simmons as a one-hooked high school science teacher and Valerie Tian as a good girl student. Fantasy genre actor Lance Henriksen (""Aliens"", ""Pumpkinhead"") has a cool, uncredited cameo.If ""Jennifer's Body"" is a horror film, it's because it's a victim of standard Hollywood packaging around a flavor-of-the-month starlet, who's still wearing training wheels. It's still a decent rent, though.",Jennifer's Body
142,culmo80,Surprisingly Better than Expected,6,24 March 2012,"On the surface, this film looks like a complete dude; a complete T&A trash ""horror"" film that tries to get by on the body of Megan Fox (pun intended), but it actually is better than expected.The acting is good, especially by Amanda Siefried, who plays a nerdy- yet-attractive high school girl named Needy who is best friends with the school hottie, Jennifer, played by Fox. The two girls go to a nearby bar where a band is playing. Jennifer has a crush on the lead singer and wants to get in with him. During the concert, a fire breaks out, killing many people (possibly based on the White Snake incident?). Jennifer ends up going with the band in their van (never good). SpoilersLong story short, the band intend to sacrifice Jennifer, who claimed she's a virgin even though she's not, in order to get favor with Satan to help them with their career. Jennifer doesn't die, instead having her soul taken over by a demon who must feed on human flesh. A series of grisly murders takes place until Needy catches on and intends to do something about it.I liked this film. I thought it was original and I thought it was better than a lot of other horror films released lately. I liked the demon/succubus aspect to the story, and I loved how Needy got back at the band during the end credits. I also liked how this film didn't take itself too seriously. There was plenty of tongue-in-cheek comedy to keep it light.This could have been better in a few areas...there was very little actual suspense; I mean you knew what was going to happen next for the most part, so they could have worked on keeping you guessing, but what are you going to do?",Jennifer's Body
143,brownah18,The feasting of boys to keep your demon inside pleased!,7,18 December 2009,"Needy (Amanda Seyfried) is in an insane asylum when you first see her in this movie and she tells about her life two years ago when she was normal and still in high school with her best friend Jennifer (Megan Fox). Then went to a bar to watch a band and just after the band has started the place burns down killing some students and parents. Jennifer wants to go with the Nikolai (Adam Brody) because she likes him. What she doesn't know is she is tied up and sacrificed to Satan as a virgin when Nikolai stabs her to death or so the band thinks. Jennifer shows up all bloody at her friend Needy's house and starts to puke up black stuff. Then the high school football player is killed and along with another boy from school later on and somehow Needy knows it is her friend Jennifer and she is not the same anymore.This movie was mostly like other movies I have seen like this where some girl gets killed and comes back to life somehow and kills the people who did it or just kills people. Don't get me wrong this movie was entertaining; I mean you have Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, and Adam Brody as the main stars in the cast. With a great cast this movie should keep you interested in the story and it all happens when they are in high school and everyone can relate to high school right? Megan Fox is currently working on some of her new roles in ""The Crossing"" (2011), ""Passion Play"" (2010), ""Jonah Hex"" (2010). Amanda Seyfried is also in a movie called ""Chloe"" (2009), ""Dear John"" (2010), ""Letters to Juliet"" (2010), ""A Woman of No Importance"" (2011), and in a TV show called ""Big Love"" as Sarah Henrickson (35 episodes, 2006-2010).

In the first Transformers film, she had, by merely bending over a car engine, given hundreds of thousands of teenage boys worldwide a reason to live. But what next? You have to figure that the actress and her agent were waiting for the perfect script, and what could be more perfect than a horror/teen project from Oscar winner Diablo Cody? With hindsight, we now see JB as a film with a script that goes nowhere, a constant refusal to engage the audience on any level, and, oh yeah, since this is an official review, the worst role of JK Simmons' career. Which is strange sort of achievement.The only one who survives this travesty is Amanda Seyfried, who essentially functions as ""the glue"" and tries to keep the viewer interested mainly by leveraging off her own high level of ""perplexity."" Fox, as we all know, ended up doing mainly TV after this. Pity.",Jennifer's Body
145,windypoplar,"tries to hard, but has it's moments",5,4 March 2010,"I was lured by the blu-ray box, which claimed Megan Fox is even hotter in this format. What can I say? Couldn't resist. Actually the film isn't as bad as many say, it just tries to hard. Diablo Cody may have shot herself in the foot with this one, or the mouth as the dialog is rather arch, but the film does have it's moments.To boot, Jennifer and her BFF Needy (Amanda Seyfried) go to club in a tiny mid-west town in the boondocks, it burns to the ground, but not before ultra-hottie Jennifer Check hooks up with a goth band. They try to sacrifice her virgin soul to the Dark Lord, but as Jenn lets you know, ""I'm not even a back-door virgin"". So the spell goes awry. Not that this makes much sense, but little does really in Cody's world. Needy notices the changes first and boys start turning up looking like ""Lasagna with teeth"" Nice line Diablo!! The film is awful at the start, but does get better as it goes. A shot of a nude Jenn swimming across a pristine lake is about as arty as the flick gets. A Later scene where she attempts so seduce Needy is bizarrely out of place, but certainly affective. The climactic battle at the pool is rather cheap, seems left over from elementary writing days, but the battle between Needy and Jenn has some nice moments.The film can't seem to finish though, Needy's revenge, this was her friend after all, is done over the end credits, rendering it irrelevant. The music score is irritating too, rather than driving the suspense, it buries the dialog and hurts your head. I'm a metal fan, I don't say these things lightly. Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried do nice work here, but combining horror and comedy is tough. ""Scream"" did it perfectly, to see it done badly see ""Cursed"" with Christina Ricci. Case in point, cracking jokes at the werewolf when it's supposed to seem scary just doesn't work. Same deal here, JB isn't as bad as ""C"" at it, but it still renders the horror weak. There is a lot of gore here, some projectile vomiting scenes could have been cut down, so don't watch after you've eaten, but if your curiosity must be sated...

Not exactly what the teenage boys who attended with the hopes of seeing Fox's bare breasts wanted from a movie.The years have been kinder to Jennifer's Body and it's now gotten a well deserved cult fanbase thanks to the funny and clever dialogue and the great performances by both Fox and Amanda Seyfried as her best friend who feels left behind.",Jennifer's Body

This is not just your typical run-of-the-mill teen slasher flick, this film truly does take the 'Not Another Teen Movie' concept and takes it literal. Sure, our cast is the average up-and-coming teen stars, Kyle Gallner stands out among most of them, playing the goth kid who gets murked, and most of you will recognize him from 2010's remake of 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'. Johnny Simmons plays his role well although I've never really heard of him so I don't know what else he has starred in to compare it with. 'Jennifer's Body' really does reference like every horror cliché of the last thirty years or so, but everything is done in such an ironic manner. It feels like how it would feel if you were watching 'Pineapple Express' and everyone starts dying half way through the movie. Orr.... umm... wait, what? To semi-quoth Adam Brody's character here, do you know how hard it is to make it as a horror-comedy these days? When was the last time you saw a good one, one that actually managed to successfully pull off the scares and the laughs simultaneously. 'Idle Hands' is really the last movie I can think of that was even worth lumping anywhere near what 'Jennifer's Body' has achieved. Everything about this movie is just ironic. Except for the fact that some of you think it's bad, and the idea that some of you are still hoping to squeeze some nudity out of this, of which there is none.'Jennifer's Body' pulls off most of what it is trying to do effectively, and I would say well worth watching.

How else would you explain Oscar winner Diablo Cody penning such a laughably ridiculous teeny-bopper-Gothic-satanic-horror-comedy and whatever-other-genre-you-wanna-add picture! Megan Fox stars as Jennifer, the flirtatious teen who is the hottest girl in school and best friends with one of the nerdiest girl with specs, Needy (Amanda Seyfried). Both of them venture out to a rock concert in one of the local bars at Devil's Kettle (the name of the town they live in). That is where the fateful events depicted in this funny film start to take shape! At the outset, it seems like some stupid teenybopper horror flick with lots of stupid dialog. But then it seems to get cleverer in a couple of scenes or more! The dialog gets better too. Further in the film, the 'horror' premise does show a little bit of promise, but ultimately it all comes down and what is offered to us is the same old nonsense that you may have seen in countless B-horror films albeit with some fresh faces and that's about it! That said, this film does have some juicy moments for those looking for some wet-dream-come-true moments and plenty of gore to go along with it! Fox and Seyfriend deliver good performances to make this film at least somewhat watchable in its approximately 107 mins running time.Otherwise it is passable fare!

152,alanrayford,A mean girl with one wicked overbite,7,3 January 2010,"""Jennifer's Body"" is by no means the best horror movie of 2009. It's not the greatest teen drama either (not even close). And, as a teen sex comedy, it mostly flounders. But here's the thing; as a horror/teen drama/ten sex romp, it's a tight package that's much greater than the sum of its parts.The story can be summed up in fifty words. Hot girl Jennifer and her hanger-on friend Needy go to see a band. It turns out this band is on the prowl for a virgin to sacrifice to Satan for their good fortune. They choose Jennifer, who isn't a virgin. This leads to her becoming a succubus, and chaos ensues. There, fifty on the nose. By horror standards this may sound rather vanilla, but there's depth to be had here.Jenny Check (Megan Fox) is shown to be a mega pain before her transformation. Yet, she doesn't come off as being a bitch so much as someone who is bored with life and her station in it. In a town like Devil's Kettle, who could blame her? Needy (Amanda Seyfried) is initially portrayed as a doormat who strives to never rock the boat. But, unlike a regular ""Pollyanna"" type, she's rather strong willed. And, as the movie progresses, her killer instinct emerges. Yeah, Jennifer turns from a mean girl into a demon that eats people. But Needy goes from being a timid ""plus one"" to a monster/Satanist slaying BAMF. Tell me who gets the more extreme makeover.Another thing I liked was the handling of the violence. In these types of films, dead characters just disappear. Here, that was not the case. The news of every murder was absorbed by the town. At first they were mortified. But, as the movie went on, they understandably became numb to the carnage. Yet, even towards the end, these deaths remained a driving force of the narrative. After all, the only reason Chip had pepper spray was because his mom was worried about what was happening. In short, actions had real consequences. Too few horror flicks establish this, yet folks still complain.Many have seen fit to bash ""Jennifer's Body"" for anything from Megan Fox's acting, to Diablo Cody's script, to Karyn Kusama's direction (notice how all three are babes). But I think the many critics missed the point. Despite the title, this wasn't Jennifer's tale. It started and ended with Needy Lesnicky, making the story hers. After saving her and Jen from a blaze that burned down a club and killed many, she could only stand by as her friend was then taken off by Low Shoulder to be sacrificed. Later, she could only watch in horror as her friend became this creature that killed people and would never stop. Worse, Needy was the only one in town who knew what the deal was. Seyfried did a good job of portraying that isolation and dread over being faced with darkness and not having anyone to lean on for support.Now I'm not going to pretend this movie was scary, but it was involving. Every time Jennifer was about to feed, I felt my teeth grinding. I truly didn't want to see these people die. They weren't the typical jerks like those seen in a ""Friday the 13th"" film. They were just regular dudes taken in by a beautiful woman that had an ulterior motive. This made each victim extremely sympathetic to me, because, at one point or another, I think we've all been there—minus the demon. Being able to relate, on some level, with a character about to die horrifically lends that death an impact which would otherwise be lacking. Each murder being followed by the victim's family grieving at a funeral also helped to make things feel like they were taking place in the real world. Another factor I enjoyed was the slight amount of humor.""An American Werewolf in London"" is credited as being a horror/comedy when it's the horror movie's horror movie. ""Jennifer's Body"", on the other hand, had just enough humor to offset an otherwise tragic storyline and not a drop more. The goth kid singing ""I Can See Clearly Now"" because he thinks he's about to hook up was hilarious. J.K. Simmons' character was so serious, so well meaning, and so clueless that, when combined with the fro and hook-hand, he was almost too much. The frenemy-ship between Needy and Jen provided just enough barbs to help keep the narrative moving. Case in point, Needy tells her bleeding to death boyfriend, Chip, that Jennifer's hovering isn't impressive. Jen shoots back by claiming Needy undermines everything she does. Sadly, there are still a few speed-bumps to this production that mar an otherwise smooth ride.A high school library having an extensive occult section is probably the funniest thing I've seen in ANY movie. Unfortunately, here it was played straight as a plot device to give Needy insight about the situation. Low Shoulder came off as dicks, when they should've been played as extremely nihilistic. Last but not least, the lesbian kiss between Needy and Jen wasn't hot. It was too gratuitous and broke up the flow of the scene it took place in. I've also noticed there appears to be footage used in the trailers that wasn't in the film (the scene where Jen burns her tongue for one).I liked ""Jennifer's Body"", and will definitely be buying it. Too bad there'll never be a sequel, due to its box office failure. I want to see what comes of poor ol' Needy Lesnicky. That shot of her after killing the members of Low Shoulder felt like it could go in any number of ominous directions.Now to the haters, get over it. Just because a movie has two leads, a director, and a writer who are women doesn't make it bad—it just makes it different. For this flick, different works.",Jennifer's Body
153,georgia_cushion,Body good fun.,8,10 July 2011,"I loved this film. I had wanted to see it for ages, and today I finally got round to watching it. I'll be honest it wasn't what I was expecting but nether-the-less I enjoyed it. I thought it had a very clever story-line and it was surprisingly funny. I thought that Seyfried and Fox were excellent choices for leading role but I also thought that Simmonds and Gallner did a great job as well. I thought that the comedy-horror was a good route to go down. Overall I would say that Jennifer's Body is a great film with some very funny parts. I would rate it 8.5/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 13+. Definitely worth a watch!",Jennifer's Body
154,realalexrice,Hey this movie is great! But it's also scary!,9,6 September 2021,"Kusama's direction mixes well with what I think Diablo Cody was going for with her script and the genre juggling it does. Kusama has some annoying quirks and Cody's dialogue might take a second to get used to for some, but the movie is both funny and frightening in what it presents under the surface with themes of abuse and fractured friendship due to a number of reasons. It really is not to be understated how humorous the film is despite the subject matters I think it discusses, all under a very late-2000's vibe, but it actually works for me here. Everyone involved should be proud of how well most of this film has aged and I'm pretty happy it has found its audience and grown from there.",Jennifer's Body
155,HBeachBabe,a (not very) insightful (not) horror-(not) comedy,5,24 March 2010,"One part Heathers, One part Scream, this vehicle for Diablo Cody's wannabe hipster dialog wants to be funny and scary and insightful and just never quite manages any of them well.The ""horror comedy"" tag seems to come from the fact that the film is slightly less bleak and sadistic than most horror films. It certainly isn't because the characters or situations are actually funny or even humorous. Rather than the genre-savvy displayed by the characters in Scream, which gave that film such a fresh approach to horror. Everything here is played straight. It's a ""horror"" film in that it involves demons and a teen girl eating her male partners after seducing them, but it isn't particularly horrifying or scary or even all that creepy. As for any insights into the relationships of teen girls, well there is something there about how female best friends can use and abuse each other, but most of this is lost to the machinations of the plot. The film was mildly entertaining, but nowhere near as clever as it thought it was. While watching, I just kept think how much better a job Joss Whedon could have done with this theme in a Buffy episode. 5 out of 10",Jennifer's Body
156,Skippy489,Horror? Check. Comedy? not really. Allegory? YES!,4,16 October 2020,"According to the trivia section of the IMDB page for this film both, ""Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried have said that this is the favorite film of their own respective filmography"". As Eric Idle once said, ""The best times can be on the worst movies and vice versa (such as) Yellowbeard (1983) which I wouldn't have missed for the world"". This film had an all star cast, Amanda Seyfried, Megan Fox, and Adam Brody- this should have been a fun movie, although the demonic part of the film should've been a warning- as I am not a fan of demonic movies, this movie is about fighting them literally and, in a way, figuratively. As strange as it sounds, this film does have positive messages once the demonic and horror stuff is set aside. Looking at the film itself, there are a few moral mixed but ultimately overshadowed by the allegories and a traditional soapy teen plot that is commonly seen on television and other teen movies.It is easy to see that the cast members were having fun while they were making it, but the film itself lacks something in the end result. The film has no real depth- it is an allegory for teenage relationships. It explores all types of sexual relationships as well as how they affect other people. It is a clever concept with a great cast- but the final product is neither comical nor scary- as the film is supposed to be a horror-comedy. It is like Twilight but stuff actually happens here and almost seems original at times- aside from the obvious horror and sex connection. The film is, unfortunately, rather bland in the final released product- even the title of the film is an innuendo. This film was a disappointment.As a fan of the top three billed actors, the acting was really good. It is hard to decide which party is responsible for the end result of the film as the writing isn't terrible, the directing isn't bad either, and the casting is really good. The allegories in the film are strong. Aside from the sexual ones, it tells of how a person is affected by a fake friend. It shows how they will fight and essentially lock themselves in a prison, how they will adapt other people's behaviors and change- become a new person, in this case for the worse. It is a powerful message presented in an entertaining way- but there should be a better focus on the final result of the film, as people may not watch the film if they do not find it entertaining in some way, shape, or form. It is a shame how the creative idea was ruined by traditional teen movie clichés and lack of comedy in a ""comedy"" film, and the only horror elements in the film are demons and blood, and a few (almost predictable) jump scares. This film had potential but could have been done a lot better.",Jennifer's Body

There is no real fright except gore. Only Amanda Seyfried can act, a little. And the movie is so boring. halfway i wanted to fall asleep. The only good thing is the band Low Shoulder, at least they got one cool song. The plot is unconvincing. if you're looking for a virgin, why not choose the 'ugly' nerdy girl? why choose the hot queen bee cheerleader, who obviously have lots of boyfriends and should not be a virgin? man, this whole thing would not have happened if they chose needy.

160,c_p_c,A worthy film not deserving of all the hate.,7,23 September 2009,"It has been some time since I've written a review on this site, but I felt this movie and its current underwhelming performance at the box office warrants some good press. ""Jennifer's Body"" is a very entertaining film, and is sure to be one that many discover in its DVD release, which according to interviews, director Karyn Kusama has material she is anxious to release.Make no mistake, JB isn't an Oscar contender, then again, it's not trying to be. It is attempting to throw the viewer into a world of heightened teenage brutality, and in that it succeeded. Diablo Cody, who seems to draw a love her/hate her reaction from audiences, writes a script that perhaps has one too many pop culture references or quirky word choices. But, that is Cody's world. Why say someone is good looking when you can say they're ""salty?"" It may not make a whole lot of sense, but Cody captures ""teen speak"" in her dialogue and it is a lot of fun to watch her characters say such unusual things with such ease and normalcy. Cody's writing is what separates this film from other ""evil-teen"" horror films. Also impressive is when Cody is able to create some genuinely sincere moments between the characters amid the violence and chaos occurring.This film does not apologize for its odd premise nor does it try to compensate for it. JB plays it straight, recognizing the plot is entirely superficial. This premise doesn't hold the film back. The plot throws enough fun details in the mix that drive this film forward, making it a fantastic platform for the starts of the film, obviously the cast and Cody's writing.About the cast: As Jennifer, Megan Fox is quite great! Not only does she have the looks to support her character, she creates a girl you love to hate. Jennifer is the ultimate high school goddess, but underneath the sexy exterior and projected confidence lies a tortured soul...physically personified by the demon within her. Fox is sexy when she needs to be, but wrecked when it calls for it. One short scene has possessed Jennifer, disgusted with herself, smearing makeup across her face in a very desperate fashion, desperate to hide her insecurities from the world. It is an impacting moment. Fox is another love/hate personality these days who draws just as much backlash as praise. Say what you want about her prior efforts, but Megan took charge of her character and was creative with her.Amanda Seyfried stood against Fox well. Naturally, Fox is a force to be reckon with these days and Amanda, playing the gawky, nice girl who hides her beauty, holds her own. The girl can act, and also creates a very sympathetic and relatable character. She manages to create some very humorous moments while being natural. Her admiration for Jennifer is quite clear and Seyfried manages to capture it nicely, without making the character seem obsessive.The guys in the cast, most who are present so Jennifer can have a meal, are each unique. Props to Kyle Gallner who disappears in his emo-goth role. I had only seen him in the bland ""Haunting in Connecticut."" Adam Brody, who plays the lead singer of the band that sacrifices Jennifer, had a lot of fun with his role. He creates a character that is so selfish and evil, but seems like a guy who would be fun to have drinks with...if you knew he didn't want to kill you.Finally, Kusama's direction is swift and competent. She captures the film well not overusing horror techniques and keeping the look of the film fresh. The film's soundtrack is also offbeat and unusual for the genre, but is filled with some great music. The song sung by Brody's band, ""Through the Trees,"" has a great rhythm and lyrics. It's the sort of song that if actually released would undoubtedly be a chart topper.Is JB the best film you will see all year? No. Is it the worst as many have been claiming? Not by a long shot. JB is different. It's star has been the center of a media obsession. JB is taking the brunt end of this. Behind the harsh criticisms of reviewers who seem to be shifting their disappointment lies a very entertaining and well-made film, despite its subject matter being quite superficial. Forget what you've heard against it, forget what you were expecting. If you like horror, Cody's style, clever films, character films or any combination of the above go see Jennifer's Body. This film deserves a better box office. I for one would like to see more films like this made, and that will only happen if people go see them. Make it happen ya'll.",Jennifer's Body

162,spotlightne,Not great but not terrible either,5,20 February 2010,"Many people don't like this film, it's true. But I don't think it's as bad as a one star.The movie is flawed in many areas, namely for a supposed horror film it isn't remotely scary. For a comedy, it's funny in parts.The main problem is its star, Megan Fox, who simply cannot act. To be fair to her, I've been informed she's in this film more because of her apparent 'good looks' than she is for any acting ability she might possess. That said, she's caked in cosmetic make up.Megan's friend in the film, Needy, is needy by name and nature. I won't bore you with the plot as the IMDb outlines that) but suffice to say, there is one scene in which the girls hook up for a lesbian embrace on a bed and kiss passionately. But before you all get excited and think it's porn, it's not. It's a very brief kiss and nothing more sexual than that ever happens between them in the movie.Jennifer's Body goes along at an even pace but it's mostly forgettable. That said, I did give it five stars, mainly because I never felt at any point switching it off.The end of the movie is predictable from its start, so no surprises there. Just one thing though, why is a cast of actors in their mid 20s playing seventeen year old kids?",Jennifer's Body

164,MidnightWarrior,No. Just NO!,1,20 September 2009,"There are many words to describe this film. Some of the best ones  include rubbish, garbage, trash, filth and despicable.   The reason I'm writing this review is because I wish someone on IMDb  had the courage to accurately let me know what this film really was all  about and someone to warn me against seeing it. Therefore, I'm doing  something for you that wasn't done for me - consider it a courtesy.   I'll start from the top: the trailers (gotta love those guys who make  them, they do a great job of generating interest) depict the film as  the a story about a super hot girl who starts killing off the boys. The  trailers made it seem like this was going to be very entertaining and a  real thrill ride. I suppose this is so because those guys are good at  their jobs.   It turns out that this film is NOTHING like the trailers. I am trying  very hard to be nice in this review, but I can't anymore. Here's what's  wrong with the film: zero character development, no story, poor plot,  Satan worship, meaningless gore & violence, homosexuality, satanic  rituals and Satan worship.  Too many talking heads and so very little action going on. We're told  things as opposed to being shown them, there's too much Voice-over  narration, and the story is somewhat told in flashbacks. These problems  aren't artistic expressions, they are classic examples of poor and  deficient script writing.  The reason I gave this film one star is because of JK Simmons and the  nice sets/locations. No other stars should be given: the acting was  bad, the script sucked and it is a tragic folly to dedicate a film to  Satan. And it's worse expecting Megan Fox to carry the film.  Everyone who acted in this film now has a dent in their resumes. By the  way, the cast was extraordinarily poorly cast. There are so many  different things that you can do instead of watching this filth. But if  you do go ahead and see it, consider yourself warned. This film is  just...bad.

166,Celluloid_Fiend,"The Only ""Horror"" Here Is Not Getting That Hour And A Half Of Your Life Back!",2,19 June 2019,"""Jennifer's Body"" is the kind of film that should remind us all that it takes a lot more to be clever, hip and interesting, then merely spouting a few modern slang terms and a sexy pout. They try to play up a campy teen angst kind of thing here, but it never rings true. It's more like pseudo-angst, thought up by a focus group of Hollywood suits, that tries to play to what they think teenagers would find ""cool,"" only to fail miserably in the attempt.The premise of this tale, is about how a teenage babe (played by Megan Fox) is sacrificed to Satan, by a loser indie band in the hopes they may be granted fame and fortune, only for her to become a flesh eating demon, because she wasn't a virgin when she was sacrificed. No, really, that is the basic plot outline here.The film tries to come off as an edgier mix of ""Mean Girls"" and ""Scream,"" but ends up as merely a putrid pile of trash, that is way too self-absorbed and into itself, and comes across as thinking it is way more clever and hip than it actually is. Most teenage horror-comedies are an extremely superficial affair, but this one is shallow at BEING shallow. There's nothing here beneath the surface at all. No insights, no meaning, no message. Heck, there's no real laughs or scares, either (unless you count the row of 18 year-old guys up in front of me, who giggled at the make out scene with Fox and Seyfried). Like some vapid teen pretty girl, the film never looks out of it's own self-induced tunnel vision, thinking itself way too smart and cool, and the film loses any chance to be relevant or entertaining. It's not just style over substance, but a self-deluded and half-formed idea of style over substance. Why have a coherent story and plot? Look, Megan Fox is swimming naked in a lake! Isn't that just so awesome?!It seems little thought was put into the script, direction, or anything else. It is merely a vehicle for Megan Fox to look ultra-sexy (in that way she usually does). No one ever bothers to go beyond this, as everyone else is just some stereotype or cipher character, used for the demands of Fox's character, who looks like she has a totally vacant expression throughout the whole movie (the very same one you'll probably have, after you watch this crap). The only thing it goes to show, is that Fox is truly a horrible actress and is certainly not up to the task of headlining a film. It takes a lot more than a few cute slang terms being thrown around, and some pathetic attempt at controversy (with a little girl-on-girl make out moment), to make a worthwhile story. Honestly, the thing feels like it was written by a couple of 13 year-old boys, who got a look at their father's Playboy collection for the first time, and thought this would be a great idea for a film. It is just a blatant attempt to appeal to the ""teeny-bopper"" crowd, who love films like ""Twlight"" and the like, and has absolutely no regards to the intelligence of the target audience (or any other audience, in general).This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen all year. If this doesn't register on many a film critics and film fans ""worst of"" lists for 2009, I fear for the mental sanity of the industry. ""Jennifer's Body"" is honest as a title for this travesty of celluloid, though, as the only thing the film ever concerns itself with is how ""hawt"" the title character looks. Unless you are a hormone-raging teenage boy, with Megan Fox as your ultimate fantasy plaything, avoid this dreck at all costs!

That doesn't surprise me though, mainly because this film is so difficult to categorize, people are wondering if they are supposed to think of it as a comedy, satire, drama, or horror. Its none of these really, its really quite a strange uncategorizable film.The plot is simple, Jennifer turns bad, and her friend Needy has to figure out whats going on / stop her. I mostly just saw this film as really quite funny, although at the same time it did sort of freak me out. I actually found myself wishing that this film was much much longer, I forget the running time but it seemed just like an hour and a half.I liked this film a lot more than I liked Diable Cody's Oscar winning cute-fest Juno. This film has more edge and everything seemed more interesting, but I guess I should be thankful for Juno because since that film was a success some random producers just said we will make whatever you write next (although I think she wrote this at the same time she wrote Juno) and so she got this strange little horror comedy made. Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried are actually both really good in this film, and even the smaller supporting roles are properly fleshed out and realistic.

Trying to much to redefine the genre and approach at all, the director and screenwriter has for the most of it succeeded, but still the before mentioned flaws are leaving a hole on the final product, a small one but it is there.Also, I can't resist saying that the short erotic scene between the two beautiful, young, talented actresses was amazing and well integrated in the story.

This movie looked absolutely ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, some parts certainly were less than impressive but overall I had fun watching it and even jumped once. That surprised me more than anything else.As a huge Adam Brody fan, I loved seeing him in such a different role. Granted this was a film surrounding high school, but he played a Gothic/punk rock dude searching for a virgin to sacrifice. I'd say it's not like anything he has done so far.Amanda Seyfried is known for being a great actress but we can really see her skills in Jennifer's Body. In the beginning she starts out as a mousy, shy, insignificant high school girl. By the end of the film she is strong, independent, strong willed and a bad-ass chic. The subtle change overtime shows her ability to not only play opposite roles but to ease into the opposite role without it seeming odd or rocky. The change is natural and subtle.What I am very sick of is Megan Fox being cast as the ""hot girl"" in every film since she become popular in the Transformers (2007).I appreciated the real feel of high school, or at least the high school I remember. With quotes like, ""Did u make reservations at the cheesecake factory?"" and, ""I ordered your corsage, it was like 12 dollars."" we see that these high school students are real teens. Not like the teens we see in shows like Gossip Girl or movies like Mean Girls. We can relate to them, their emotions, their lives, and their relationships.What I didn't appreciate was the teen ""lingo"" in this movie. I don't know if Diablo Cody is trying to make up her own ""cool"" language or if she thinks this is really how teens speak on a daily basis. We saw this with the language in her film Juno as well.The following are ridiculous words and phrases found throughout Jennifer's Body:""Cheese and fries"" ""Shutties"" (Shut up) ""Lesbigay"" (Lesbian) ""Jello"" (Jealous) ""Fagoes"" (Faggots) ""Is he packing some serious pubic inches?""

While her snappy dialog propelled her first feature to box office success, and an Academy Award for her script, her second feature, Jennifer's Body, shows that so far, Cody seems to be a one-trick pony.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD: Jennifer is a teenage cheerleader who gets picked up by some devil's worshipers and become a demon who eats the guys who like her. The whole thing plays like a bad horror comedy. Fox can't act and has a great difficulty portraying anything remotely believable as the lead. She's nothing more than eye candy here.Amanda Seyfriend fresh from Mamma Mia and the hit show, Big Love, is far better as Jennifer's best friend, appropriately named Needy.The ending, while a shock, sets things up for another film, and I heard a lot of whining from the audience by the time the credits rolled.My advise, wait for this one on DVD, save your money for a better movie.",Jennifer's Body
173,TruPretender,Jennifer's Body is lifeless...,4,20 September 2009,"The film has no objective method of approach. It's neither horror, nor comedy. It's satire (bad satire, at that.) The film enjoys constant displays of ideas and images that correlate to the country (red, white and blue; burning flag) and religion (Town's name is ""Devil's Kettle"" religion is referenced many times.) matched with some of the admit-tingly hilarious dialogue of Diablo Cody, and of course, Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried (who bring us guys a VERY likable bedroom scene.), to bring you one of the weirdest experimental teen horror flicks that tries to make a statement at the same time. The narratives that form the message are in your face at some times, and subtle and barely registering, at others. The film tries to say one thing, but is so clearly the other. The film then so, became herky jerky and inefficient. I left the theater in a state of sugar daddy comatose wanting more from the two leads and less from the so called ""statement (which I didn't get any more of anyway.)What we have here, is a failure to communicate-a direct result of the writer, Diablo Cody, herself! This film is illogical and messy in it's attempt to display teen horror in a satirical manner. It doesn't move much past the opening, when the logic and reason are thrown out in a bizarre series of events that almost don't make sense. It then goes to play itself with a new breed of 'lingo' that writer Cody obviously thinks the new-age audiences will thrive off of. It's a high-school horror movie doing bad stand -up comedy, or rather, it's Darren Steins ""Jawbreaker"" with a satanic twist. The story introduces some harsh events that will only disable one's thinking ever more...But when it all comes down, we have two genres slugging it out by the flagpole. It's easy to see, no one is going to get this movie. Those who will like it, will not so, for the reasons they should, and those who do NOT like it, will so because they don't get what Cody is trying to tell us. What's that? You got us. The film is a cross between political statement, and social anxiety of religion, particularly in a school setting. This could have been a keen idea for the new generation of 'R' rated horror films, but Cody tries to make the film too appealing, getting lost and indulged in the dialogue, the social dynamic, and Megan Fox. Therefore, the film has no direction. It's lost early on, and the film misses the mark. The film had a few merits, such as Amanda Seyfried who delivers the only genuine performance. Hers is a solid, character remaining a stable element that (barely) holds the film together in it's best moments. But when it all comes down, the film is hindered by the story, the plot (there is a difference between the two) and characters, all of which take a back seat to the muddled ""message"" of the film and the film suffers from inconsistency.",Jennifer's Body

It is a much higher quality film than your average 'horror' movie today, and even shoes how the evil in it came to be, and where it came from including some history about it.The best thing about this story is that it is full circle, something we don't see often in movies today.I write this short review spoiler-free so you may enjoy this movie as much as myself and my girlfriend did.

Everything you've heard about this film being underrated, and Ahead of it's time is all true.Most people highlight Megan Fox's performance in the film which is great, in my opinion her best work till date, but I think Amanda Seyfried also deserves some praise, her brilliant performance was overshadowed with the negative reception of the film.I was also surprised about little to none nude scenes in the movie. Reports from back in the day made it seem like this film was full of nude scenes.

Witty, funny in its deliveries which feel somehow light-hearted yet leading to serious consequences and situations.Being a teenager can feel like being in ""Hell"" and this movie gives aspects of it.Don't watch expecting to be scared like The Exorcist and don't expect a ""Not Another Teen Movie"" type of funny. It's a clever kind of funny within the characters situational absurdity. Intelligent.There are layers in Cody's story that I've found in rewatching. The acting and directing, as well as, the cast chosen to fit the characters are well done.",Jennifer's Body

178,saudaminikulkarni,So underrated .,8,7 May 2021,"I think this movie came out at a time when the world wasn't ready for it. It was witty, funny, sharp and also had a deeper revenge story embedded into the glossy high school horror film. Megan fox did a great job and embodied Jennifer perfectly, and it's a pity that no one appreciated her for it. I think the movie definitely deserves cult status.",Jennifer's Body
179,ennieday09,"Overall a funny dark comedy, way better than I expected, don't be so quick to judge",7,18 September 2009,"Let me start off by saying the amount of criticism towards before it's even released is ridiculous. Many people are bashing this movie for lets face it, the fact Megan Fox is starring in it. Give the girl a break people, we all know she can't act well but thats what someone with looks gives you, a movie meant not for acting credentials but meant for pure silly fun, which is what Jennifer's Body is. Secondly, anyone who says this movie will suck because they think the trailer looks stupid or the plot sounds retarded, i shun. There have been thousands of cases where a movie looks bad at first from a trailer but ends up being a good movie. You will never know if a movie is good until you actually go see it yourself. Don't let someone else decide for you if a movie is good if you haven't even seen it yet.OK now lets get to the movie, I admit when I first heard of this movie I did not have high expectations but I gave it a chance, given that it was written my Diablo Cody(writer of Juno) and I must say she delivers once again. This movie of course won't get the praise that Juno did but it's still overall a fun entertaining movie that you could enjoy. Megan Fox stars as Jennifer Check, a high school girl who turns into a boy-eating demon due to an unfortunate incident. Now majority of the people who will hate this movie are: A- people who despise Megan Fox because she is simply a pretty face with amateur acting capabilities. Or B- because they hate movies with sex and gore. Allow me to answer those two right away. You already know its starring Megan Fox so if you think you will simply hate it just for her and ignore the fact this movie contains other great characters, than don't bother seeing it. And the movie from its trailer, is obviously bloody and has sex in it due to the fact its Rated R for ""bloody violence and sexuality"" (God people read the ratings before watching a movie) If you don't have a problem with these two elements than you should be fine watching it. Again this movie is a dark-comedy, and not an Oscar caliber movie but just enjoy the movie for what it is. I thought the humor wasn't overdone and had me laughing at many moments. Amanda Seyfried has a wonderful performance as Megan's ""sidekick"" so to speak and the plot is somewhat simple but still enjoyable. Overall i came into the theater with low expectations but left thinking of a good popcorn flick. Give this movie a chance and maybe you will like it.",Jennifer's Body
180,nicholaskutzin,Favorite Horror Movie Ever!!!,10,7 August 2021,"1. This movie is a fantastic, the characters are great and show real personality, especially thanks to the acting performances.2. I have noticed that all the people who have written about the ""bad writing"" in this movie never use correct grammar, punctuation, or spelling so don't listen to them.3. This movie is written to be different, so if you compare it to other horror movies it is going to seem very odd, maybe even off-putting, but if you leave the movie on its own, it is hilarious and fun. It is not meant to be super scary, but I found all the horror aspects to be very well done and all the comedy to be very funny. Yes, there are parts of the movie that seem very odd and/or unnecessary, but those parts are what makes it realistic and amazing.This movie is generally fantastic. Just do not compare it to others because it is not meant to be compared. It is so different in such a good way.",Jennifer's Body

182,zadkine,From Ellen Page to Megan Fox,1,18 September 2009,"After"" Juno"", Cody could have worked with any studio, any producer, any stars in Hollywood. So what does she do? She took her new-won power and created a cheesy, soft porn, mildly scary, totally worthless sexcapade aimed at white male teenagers. What a waste of talent. It's totally predictable (read her biography), and probably signals her rapid decline on the heels of her rapid ascent. The acting, the art direction, the dialog, the music, none of it works. It's easy to mock it as the HBO version of Buffy the Vampire etc., but that would be an insult to both HBO and Buffy. One can only assume Cody has no moral compass, that she sees writing movies akin to how copywriters write commercials. It's just a job, who cares what you're selling, it's all about the money. It's too bad she's gone down this road. Has she driven too far to turn back?",Jennifer's Body
183,AngelFall1n,Dark comedy,10,31 May 2021,"Jennifer's body is a dark comedy for teenagers and adults alike, with quite an important meaning. It's not overly funny, nor dark and gory like most horror movies. The storyline and character development is superb and easy to follow with the narrative. It kind of reminds me of Mean Girls, but with a twist.Jennifer is nothing like Needy and yet, they have been best friends since childhood. Both need one another to feel validated and fill a void. They then come across a regular rock band at the Devil's kettle (named after a water fall), in which they discover that they're searching for a virgin to sacrifice to Satan, in exchange for fame and riches. If the sacrifice is impure, the demon attaches itself to the victim, and feeds on human flesh to sustain life. Jennifer's Body shows the superficialities of high school and the desire to fit into society, and some things come at a price.It's a great movie and a cult classic that's worth watching, with amazing performances by Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried.",Jennifer's Body
184,nflores342,Turns out Megan Fox is not hot enough.,5,29 December 2009,"Given that yes Megan Fox is gorgeous and stunning,and knows how to sell sex, but it's a shame her acting isn't as successful. I give her kudos for attempting to try something partially new, you know real acting, but turns out whatever movie she is in she is still showing skin.Have at it guys. I can see why the movie failed, but I could also see where it had possibilities. Diablo Cody excelled in Juno, and here you can see remnants of that. The smart mouthy talk Juno MaGuff(incorrect spelling, my bad)had was portrayed here and it failed miserably. It worked at times wonderfully, but was thrown way over aboard.The idea of Megan Fox in a Diablo Cody movie sends lights going off everywhere, but how do you sell her to an audience, with a Juno humor audience, and a rated R showing. You Cant. The whole story of a demon eating boys could have worked, but the emphasis that Fox is in the movie took away from that, leaving sex on a stick and a few dead boys.(by the way loved chip) So J-bod failed not only at the box office, but as a movie put together, it had too many pieces missing, and way too much Megan fox.(I know some guys are thinking ""too much fox?

Megan Fox has never been better cast than as the teen queen who is killed and brought back from the dead as a man hungry demon. Amanda Seyfried is equally good as her long suffering best friend. The dialogue by Diablo Cody is both surreal and witty in equal measures. It's probably not a movie for everyone, but horror comedy fans will find something to enjoy in there.",Jennifer's Body
186,surface6669,Actually not that bad,7,30 September 2009,"I can understand why some would want to poo-poo Megan Fox's first ""big movie"", but I thought that this movie wasn't all that bad.I liked the one-liners that the characters exchanged in the movie...these are teenagers people...it's really not serious dialog. The demon angles that were played were quite interesting as well, and I LOVED the heavy metal music that played around or after each kill...that may be my own musical preferences coming through though.Let's face it...Megan Fox is nuclear hot. I swear that her stomach is the tightest looking thing that I've ever seen in this movie. No, she doesn't get naked (just some side boobage & a lot of near nakedness otherwise while she's swimming), but the female-on-female kissing scene was well worth it IMO.If you can leave your serious side at the door, this movie, which isn't that long, will entertain you for sure. Will it be winning any significant awards? No, but that's not what this movie was about. It was merely a fluff piece...nothing more or less. Try & see it for free...it'll be well-worth it...lol...",Jennifer's Body
187,drunkenhopfrog,Don't Believe All The Bad Hype,7,27 September 2009,"For a moment, folks, can we forget that Juno scribe Diablo Cody or perceived celebrity tramp Megan Fox has anything at all to do with ""Jennifer's Body?"" For whatever reasons those two come with so much preconceived baggage that it seems to me that a lot of people can't get around that and watch the movie with an unbiased eye. One of the reasons that I believe that is because I have never seen Megan Fox in a movie before ""Jennifer's Body"" and I caught Juno during its early run, so that was before whatever caused the Diablo Cody backlash; and I liked ""Jennifer's Body."" I read on a blog not long ago something that I think is profound with regard to today's fandom. I wish I could attribute it to the right source, but alas I can't remember from whence it came. I think it was a sports blog and it went something like this: ""Today's fan is much more concerned with what to hate then what they love."" I think that fits with Fox and Cody pretty well.For a guy, ""Jennifer's Body"" is a slightly difficult movie to completely Get. It is not Megan Fox's movie, but rather Amanda Seyfried's (Needy)as Jennifer's ""BFF"" and Johnny Simmons (Cliff) as Needy's boyfriend. ""Jennifer's Body"" is not that different from Mean Girls or Thirteen or in some ways Clueless. Also I believe the R rating was a mistake. This is definitely a soft R rating and could have used a promotion that steered it more towards the PG-13 camp and to have been targeted more towards girls than boys.Needy (Seyfried) is a cute, funny, and basically well adjusted high school teen with a nice average boyfriend called Chip (Simmons). Needy is best friends with the school's top of the food chain knockout, Jennifer. Needy and Jennifer have know each other since early childhood where they grew up as leader and sidekick; Jennifer always took the best toys, played the most beautiful, and the princess. Needy is OK with their relationship, even going so far as to adjust her style of dress to something Jennifer would not consider competitive in sexiness.Jennifer is exactly like every gorgeous and ostensibly self confident girl that one has ever known in life or seen in the movies. She is like The Plastics in ""Mean Girls."" She is self obsessed, daring, vulgar, and always in control. Early in the movie she convinces Needy to go with her to a local bar where a semi popular City Band was playing.Events at the bar do no go well. Needy gets a bad vibe form the band that Jennifer is being obvious and bold with, and just when the band starts to sing the bar catches on fire. Almost all inside perish except for Needy and Jennifer as well as the visiting band. A shocked Jennifer retreats from the fire with the band while Needy's protests fall on deaf ears. The next time we see Jennifer, she is not quite the same person.The humor surrounding ""Jennifer's Body"" is dark and somewhat stilted against the culture of populist America. From the time Jennifer is transformed to the end of the movie, the viewer is treated with both literal and symbolic rants against popularity, fame, friendship, and beauty worship. Not only does the movie step onto the well tread road of the normal girls' relationship with the sexy diva, but the movie also is requesting the viewer to maybe, just perhaps eventually – feel sorry for the diva. Being objectified as a sex symbol must not be an easy road to travel.Jennifer's relationship with Needy and sympathy for the popular girl come into play more and more as the movie progresses. When juxtaposed against the relationship between the demon Jennifer and the suddenly rebelling Needy, some things about 'need' start to become clear. In fact, I would say the name 'Needy' is an attempt at a Dickensesque cue from Cody and the key to much of the movie. It is supposed to be obvious that Needy needs Jennifer and goes out of her way to maintain the friendship; but it becomes just as obvious that Jennifer needs Needy as a person that, while in many ways supplicant, also associates with Jennifer outside the realm of objectification.The movie also deals with fame, its dubious honor, and the lengths that many in the entertainment industry will go to to get it. This theme is personified by the band that escaped the bar and later kidnapped Jennifer. They are able to claim fame from some of the circumstances of that night (as well as there being a supernatural influence) and bare a striking resemblance to alternative music washout cum propagandist mouthpiece 3 Doors Down (fittingly with the ubiquitous presence of the hackneyed ""Citizen Soldier"" in most American theaters).The one clunky part of the movie is the forced and trite dialog. Pretentious popular vernacular and snappy pop-dense rants were fun in ""Clueless,"" charming in ""Juno,"" the point in Wodehouse, but amazingly contrived and ultimately annoying in ""Jennifer's Body."" I don't know if that is how teens today – either rural, suburban, or both – talk, but if it is to some degree I can't imagine that it is with such gleeful gluttony. The zippy conversations sound like something Kevin Williamson would write if he was an android pretending to be a teenage girl a thousand years in the future using today's urban dictionary as a reference. Nothing about it sounds realistic, but I guess neither does a teenage succubus.I think ""Jennifer's Body"" should be given a chance. Give it a chance as a dark teenage comedy with elements of horror. It's not that bad and at times is actually quite good.",Jennifer's Body

189,alan_v35,Worth seeing says the Manhattan Movie Maniac,7,4 October 2009,"I saw Jenniefer's Body in its third and final screening at the Toronto film festival and found it to be a pleasant surprise. This is a comedy/horror in the vein of an American Werewolf in London, and this genre has more than its share of video store dust collectors. Two names give this one a shot of avoiding this fate. One is Diablo Cody's sparkling writing which though sometimes over the top, is interesting, amusing and at least makes us old geezers over 25, feel like we are in on the hippest new teen slang. Whether we are or not, how would I know? I haven't spoken to a teen since the last time I got a 2am Big Mac at a drive through. The other advantage Jenniefer's Body has is, well, Jennifer's body. Hiring Transformers star, Meagan Fox, has gotten this film a lot of attention and even more so when word got out on what a sexy role the sultry beauty would be playing. She looks good (pronounced in this case as goooooooood) and puts in a pretty solid performance besides. This girl may still have a future when she stops spouting off yawning filler dialog next to stupid alien warbots that somehow felt that they should earn some extra product placement coin by turning into the latest model year of cars sold on a planet 800 zillion years from where they're from. Sorry. Guess I sprinted off onto a raving tangent for a second there.Jennifer's Boday is the story of a couple of teenage friends. The applicably named everygirl is Needy (played by Amanda Seyfried), who finds herself torn between her sweet boyfriend, Chip (Johnny Simmons) and her hot, school ruling best friend, Jennifer Check sizzled up by the aforementioned Ms. Fox. The two friends head off to a local bar where Jenniefer is hot to hook up with a visiting band. They both have a night of their lives, but not in a good way. All young women at this age are undergoing a lot of changes, but not usually as extreme as Jennifer who might also be some kind of bloodthirsty, short-skirted monster. Its up to Needy to figure out whats going on.With equal parts comedy, horror, gore and a little suspense mixed in, this film tries to do a lot, but never tries to take itself seriously, which in the end saves it from sinking into the crap pile. Some decent performers firing out Cody's Juno-style dialog make this one worth catching. If you would like to read more of my reviews, check me out at realmoviereview.com.",Jennifer's Body

191,gauravsharmam,"Ignore the critics,ratings,just for Megan,not that bad.🤔",7,25 May 2020,"I downloaded this movie, knowing the ratings,reviews and critic's comments, no doubt this is an underrated movie ,not that scary but it has some(finger-count) very hazardous and provoking jumpscares .
More than horror, it's thrilling and moody.
I'm happy that both of lead actresses gave justice to their character. Technically this movie is adorable ,but direction is dull and slow .
Movie starts with Needy's(Amanda) narration in prison where she tells the story of her and her childhood friend Jennifer(Megan) how she became evil from angel (sacrificing her to satan ) . There is much mot shown in the movie which should've been.
Concept is so different and admirable but the treatment given to it is the reason this movie got these negative ratings (I hope) .
Megan fox look so pretty and hot as a man-eater witch ,Amanda seems so pretty and innocent in her no-makeup look .
Apart from these things Jennifer's body has a wonderful soundtrack which will warm your soul . Ending could've done better. Still it's worth watching.
If you're willing to watch Jennifer's body ,then you can or you should, take my words it won't disappoint you although it will give you a memorable experience.

192,dvoon-missy-mcmuffin,Surprisingly Good (with an open mind),8,6 December 2009,"This movie really caught me by surprise too. I am one of those that tries to keep away from trailers or critiques comments (since nowadays at this age of time, most of these so-called critiques just spoils everything for the viewer - describing the plot that leaves little to the storytelling.zzz...anyhow, thats another subject altogether) back to the topic at hand, Jeniffer's Body is great if you want a movie that is not afraid for presenting it to you without any pretense of what it wants to be.All these negative comments that i'd read seems to be that the viewers wanted or had a vision of what they expected the movie to be and in the end, it does not live up to the individual hypes that was brought forth among themselves. Just because it was helmed by a creator of previous hit, tends to elevate those viewers expectations.But if one were to be like me, whom watch it without any self expectations of what the movie is nor have any inkling about the plot other than those general interviews by the stars themselves, all i knew about Jennifer's Body then was that it was a black comedy.And for that point alone, this movie actually delivers more. I can see how certain context of the film or script/speech/portrayal of character(s), sometimes they are not afraid to take themselves seriously too. And that is a bonus on my part for watching this movie. Besides, i find that the character(s) were well represented and acted as well. Cheesy at times, and certain aspects of Megan Fox just oozes out creepiness.Anyhow, try to enjoy the movie for what it is. A black satire of a comedy that does not take itself seriously. To me, Jennifer's Body is the horror version of Mean Girls. If you'd enjoyed the latter, you will enjoy this. Cheerzzzz",Jennifer's Body
193,fatehsmann,A waste of time,1,21 December 2010,"With every movie I watch, the importance of a director becomes more and more apparent to me. Here was a concept, which, despite not being terribly original, could have been really worked upon, especially with the next big thing in Hollywood, Megan Fox in it- that at least guarantees a few guys giving it a shot just to see her (like me)The scare factor could have been increased, the suspense and the mystery could have been highlighted more, maybe the relationship between the two best friends could also have been exploited. But whatever, the director's intentions were, it become an extremely unscary cheesy horror movie.I'm still not convinced Megan Fox can act. While her performance wasn't bad, she didn't exactly blow the world apart either. In fairness, i think she did okay according to the script, which didn't really demand a lot of acting skills so the verdict is still outDon't waste your time on it.",Jennifer's Body

It was refreshing to have two strong female leads, with the men serving only as minor characters and plot devices. It was great to see the typical 'pretty girl in underwear gets chased around and killed' theme reversed. And I love that the only actual sex scene was as clunky and unimaginative as nervous teen sex would be in real life.There are a lot of negative reviews for this film, I think owing to all the reasons I liked it for. That and the fact that Megan Fox barely showed any flesh. To all those people, your loss!

But things only get better from there.The story revolves around Highschool student Needy, her boyfriend Chip and best friend Jennifer. After the club the two friends are in burns down, some mysterious rock stars offer to take Jennifer home. Needy sees her again that night, but discovers something is terribly wrong with her friend. I won't spoil the plot, but I'll say what happened wasn't too comely....and now Jennifer is possessed.For some reason she focuses her attentions on seducing and then murdering boys. After setting her sights on Needy's boyfriend the sparks start to fly and a supernatural battle begins.Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried both turn in worthy perfromances. The script teeters on the brink of being comical, but the blood and creepy symbolism keep things from getting too silly.

Seriously it's just bad horror and bad comedy wrapped in the promise of nudity that doesn't come. It was advertised as a horror/dark comedy, but what you get is a muddled teen drama/horror film. The acting was average and the script was boring. You get the feeling you've seen this movie a dozen times before, but better executed.

The climax is not climax at all, i still think that WE WANT to know more about the relationship of this two and, besides, some of the CGI is horrible.It got it's things - Fox and Seyfreid are great, and actually, opens very good until the first 15 minutes or so.

200,FishBibble,Honestly if you don't get this movie....,9,6 August 2021,"Then you have me totally curious more about what makes you tick than this movie.This movie isn't the best thing ever, it doesn't lets say rewrite the entire horror genre, like something like Cabin In The Woods did for instance. But it was more along the lines of Ginger Snaps, a portrayal of females that doesn't play into society stereo types.That honestly has caused a lot of the reason many people who 'just don't get it' as well. Many of the people who disliked Ginger Snaps honestly seem incapable of liking a movie where the main female protagonists don't play into their fantasies. As soon as they step out of fulfilling that for them, they 'can't get into it', and so to each their own, but they are missing out in my opinion.And yet many other people assume that Megan Fox is going to portray some cookie cutter 'hot girl' trope, but when it doesn't happen they 'don't get it'. Once again, almost in a mirror sort of way, Jennifer doesn't live up to the fantasy of what a 'hot girl' should be, but because they got ready to hate her in that role, and it doesn't happen they are a good way through the movie anticipating a completely different movie, and now 'don't get it'. Because they were so lost in expecting Megan to be that 'hot girl' they want to hate, and because she plays on that trope herself, often subtle to the point that i think some people don't get the camp, so they end up missing that tone, which is an important part of getting the entire movie, in relation to the main protagonist who is going through that herself.,I can't be sure though, but many progressive people have hated Megan Fox, unfairly, ever since the placed her in a box of things and people to hate, and when she doesn't act as they once again 'expect', then they 'don't get it'. Their ego being tied into hating 'the hot girl' stereotype, which they have once again mistaken forced Megan Fox to be in their own minds. The usual, 'she didn't have to act like that in Transformers' not considering that they themselves would have taken up the exact same role is someone in Hollywood had offered it to them when they were 17. So it is a bit of sour-grapes over Megan Fox, despite Megan having taken a full on assault by the press when she came out essentially for the #metoo movement before it was 'cool' to do so. So she has been taken flake because she was in fact ahead of the curve. Beautiful and ahead of the curve naturally has some women feeling competitive. (A stereotype, like all stereotypes, with some sadly truth behind it too often). Actually showing she was actually long for the #metoo movement even before they were. Megan gets hate from both sides unfortunately, and neither is deserved.I think she is a force to be reckoned with. Though her latest movie, 'In The Switch Grass' seemed like some weird attempt to by pass 'Hollywood' machine altogether, understandable given Megan Fox's history of abuse from that machine. But unfortunately it ended up only showing why the machine exists, producing movies with not much semblance of consistency. 'In The Switch Grass' unfortunately has nothing holding it all together, no likeable or relatable characters because of the way they entire movie was directed, and the material feels entirely unoriginal, and without any depth at all. Perhaps the book has some lyricism that made it work, that was not successfully carried onto the film. But that movie is an example of a film where i totally get people saying 'I don't get it'. Including Megan's role, might have a point.But this film, she is at her best i think. A total force to be reckoned with the entire movie, exactly what her character is suppose to be.I also think people don't like this because it isn't on the nose horror like so much out there, where the entire point is the killing, here in Jennifer's Body the point of the movie is the situations the main characters find themselves in, until the end where she has a meaningful transformation into frankly a similar badass to that of Jennifer. That entire relationship is mirroring that of many girls, the one hot friend, etc and perhaps many guys don't get that, but i think as a guy it plays well and even i can see what the main character is going through, and her motivations, even including her attitude change at the end. By which point she has totally stopped caring what people think at all... it isn't Shawshank Redemption, or have the philosophical depth of something like 'Fight Club', or 'Inception' etc, it is a very straight forward movie with a tone that feels very fresh compared to most movies.I would say the best comparison for me would be 'A Werewolf In London'. It doesn't have a similar attraction like the 'first big werewolf vfx transformation' that helped make that movie, but it does have some similar story telling elements that weave an interesting movie with an original tone. A personal decent into the world of the supernatural that leaves the protagonist completely changed by the end, and partially adapted to the insane things their character is dragged through. If you only care about gore, this isn't the movie for you. It doesn't try to out gore other movies, similar to Ginger Snaps the gore fits the situation in the movie, and sells the emotional moments for the main protagonist(s). Ie the kitchen scene after her original reresection. We can almost see what it would be like to be in that situation with a friend, except instead of helping a friend who is sick from drinking way too much, she is undead and throwing up a giant pool of blood all over your kitchen floor.,..",Jennifer's Body
201,thecinemaview,She's Evil...And Not Just High School Evil.,7,26 September 2009,"Aiming considerably lower than she did in her breakout hit ""Juno"", screenwriter Diablo Cody tackles the challenging world of teen horror comedy. Instead of a wise-cracking pregnant teenager, she is now delivering us a gorgeous, cannibalistic cheerleader. The product is inferior, but certainly not bad. In fact, it is undeniably good. Featuring every teen boy's fantasy, Megan Fox, as the titular Jennifer Check, the film has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek right from the get-go, and is noticeably proud of it. Fox, widely-recognized for her beauty rather than her talent, is surprisingly effective, though she never quite grasps the purpose of Diablo Cody's quirky dialog. Often, she says humor-laced dialog with complete seriousness and vice-versa. Ultimately though, when she dares to let her hair down and have some fun with her performance, she epitomizes the guilty-pleasure-esquire appeal that Cody was aiming for. Amanda Seyfried, on the other hand, proves to be the film's strongest performer, hitting the nail on the head every time.Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com",Jennifer's Body

203,Screaming_egg,Confused Movie,3,7 July 2018,"Classic US college cheap thriller/horror movie. Full of cliches and ""horror wanna-be"" scenes. Movie can't decide if it's a thriller, a horror movie or a college prom drama.",Jennifer's Body
204,freeist,"Somehow, it never comes together.",4,14 April 2010,"Jennifer's Body seems to have everything needed for a good horror movie, but it never comes together. It just seemed like the plot needed to re-arrange a few things, the dialog needed just one more draft, the directing needed just a little more imagination, the acting needed a little more inspiration, and the music . . . needed to be there, and so on. Taken separately, they are all little things, but together they cause the movie to, if not sink, at least run aground.That being said, there are no big mistakes that would make Jennifer's Body a truly bad movie. The plot is: two teenage girls, who are close friends from childhood, become enemies after a brush with the supernatural changes one of them. If this sounds familiar, it is because maybe you have seen Ginger Snaps, which did this plot concept first and better, and where the leads looked like real high-schoolers. Jennifer's Body is what results when Hollywood tries to do a ground-breaking movie like Ginger Snaps. Comparisons between the two films are inevitable for that reason.JB's take on the concept is that Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried) have been friends ""from the sandbox."" Jennifer is the class champion in beauty, and Needy is the smarter, shyer one. Being under the mistaken impression that Jennifer is a virgin (Megan Fox?), an independent band made up of satanists lures her into being sacrificed for their success. She returns to life with a demon fused to her soul, which we are told is the inevitable result of not being virgin when sacrificed. The movie does try for a heavier subtext. The imagery in the forest scene seems to be reaching for something, with all kinds of herbivorous animals show up for the killing and acting like carnivores. In other scenes, there is some Christian imagery that is suggestive. Unfortunately, unless you are very forgiving of the lack of atmosphere and the inconsistent tone running through the scenes, it is hard to be impressed by this. The animals gathering to wait for the slaughter kill and comes off as an absurdity, and the cuteness cancels the horror. There was a way to bring that scene off, and director Karyn Kusama does not find it. Too often Diablo Cody's wry script and Kusama's directing clash rather than compliment each other. For example, in a scene where Jennifer gets impaled, which seems like it should be a very solemn scene, which includes stark imagery, but Jennifer suddenly says to Needy, ""You have a tampon?"" A funny line but it hits a flat note in the context and kills whatever horror there was. This happens all through the movie.It has some good scenes, however. The sacrifice scene turns funny as the band-leader apologizes to Jennifer, telling her how hard it is to make it as an independent band, and how badly they need some extra edge, before slaughtering her. The opening scene in the mental hospital is also good, where Needy's chart warns that she is a ""kicker."" Also, Jennifer's return after the sacrifice is scary and weird. The movie's sexual boldness also works. The much misunderstood lesbian scene serves to strengthen the characters and plot rather than to just titillate. Unfortunately, all of these occur in the context of scenes that do not work at all, but should have. The bar burning down, a scene early in the film, should have been scary. I can't point to any mistake, but it was totally flat and felt staged; somehow I knew there was a camera crew there somewhere. The director just failed to make it real enough, and the music just seemed absent. There were all kinds of scenes like that: the overgrown pool, Jennifer's encounter with the school jock-- for not even a second did those scenes ""look"" real or generate scares.The major problem is really with Kusama's direction. Though she's competent overall, she seemed to have no idea about the basics of how to film horror, much less meld it with comedy and subtext. Megan Fox did a decent acting job, I thought, though this is not a vehicle that let her show much emotional range. Diablo Cody's dialog is written with the kind of wry slang that might have worked in Juno (which I haven't seen) but which has mixed results here. I cringed to hear Fox say ""move on dot org"" but I have to hand it to her, she said it in the exact dry tone that had the only chance of making it work, and her being the one saying it at least did not make it any worse. Also, even though Fox is . . . a fox, and so a traditional asset to a horror fantasy movie, she looked too old for the part.Also, Amanda Seyfried does a very good job as Needy, but even here, I have to qualify it. She, like Fox, looked too old for the part, and there was very little chemistry between her and Fox. This chemistry had to completely work for the film to work. Dialog between them at the end, which should have said so much about their now-defunct friendship, were so detached from the action that they sounded like lines Diablo Cody forgot to put in sooner. Seyfried and Fox could not saved it no matter how well they delivered it. Again, if you want to see this concept done right, and be moved by it, see Ginger Snaps instead. It achieves more atmosphere in a playground setting than Jennifer's Body does with a derelict house, a burning building, an overgrown pool at night, and a forest. It also had a better wit and chemistry between the leads that worked one hundred percent.",Jennifer's Body

Usually I wouldn't take the time to surrender my thoughts on a movie of this caliber, but you need to be warned.""Jennifers Body"" is not a good movie. The premise of the movie bad, and so is the non-existent story line. You get the feeling that Ms. Fox took on this role as she saw it as an opportunity to put to rest the rumor of how terrible an actor she is. To be fair, she wasn't bad with what she was given to work with.The story line is boring and doesn't make sense. After a particular bar scene in the movie with some band members - the story arc turns weird.This movie's story line was very reminiscent of a movie called ""The Faculty"" - with that kid from Lord of the Rings who's name escapes me. If you liked that movie, you will like this movie.If your looking for a scary movie that has some substance - I recommend ""Paranormal Activity"" instead.Not worth your time, unless you're bored and want to financially support Megan Fox's acting career.",Jennifer's Body

208,hitechcleaning5,More ironic than horrific.,8,30 April 2010,"If I like a film I will watch it several times. This is one of the exceptions. I did watch it several times, but aside from the actors and the acting, the film was a disjointed jumble of contradictions and misdirection.One thing I liked about the film is it created its own genre; it wasn't a horror film but more of a mockery of the paranormal thinking some of us have grown to mistrust...or disbelieve altogether. I think this was more by accident than design, however. Diablo Cody is not that clever.Part of the irony is casting. One might expect Amanda Seyfried to be cast as the beautiful antagonist. In this setting, she is the opposite. The glasses, the dowdy clothes and Needy's general demeanor actually work to plant her character as ""nerdy."" Her acting skills make it believable. A role reversal could work also. Megan Fox could be Needy and Amanda could be Jennifer. I think that might be just as good if not better. Fox states ""she could never be the alpha female."" Nevertheless, her character is.After reading their bios and quotes, they seem very different. Megan Fox is much more intelligent than her image might have one believe. She is not promiscuous, ostentatious or amoral. She has a clear view of herself and how sexuality relates to her womanhood and her acting, but does not seem to let that affect her personal life. Amanda is straightforward, versatile and not complex or arrogant. Although they are very different, either could play the part of the other in this film. They are also friends, or so I read. I liked ""Jennifer Speak."" Her one liners were cool even with the built in plugs: ""You're Jello, you're lime green Jello, I've got the 03 Chrysler Sebring, where's it at Monistat."" The writer must have stayed up nights thinking up witty things that are exclusive to Jennifer's character which is filled with ""varsity moves and a white trash pig roast."" Either actor could deliver those lines, but only Jennifer could pull them off. If Diablo Cody deserves any credit at all, it would be for that.Johnny Simmons is the perfect Chip. He is so subordinate to Needy, but yet another irony. Needy would be expected to be subordinate and submissive, but she calls all the shots with Chip, and he goes along with anything. Is he to Needy as Needy is to Jennifer? I didn't buy a lot of the script. After the fire and the killings there was a short period of remorse followed by great anticipation of a school dance along with an apparent obsession with Low Shoulder as both heroes and as a ""killer"" band. This was neither realistic nor credible as Needy, an independent witness, refutes the hero stories but is rebuffed. Also, the only bar in a small semi-rural town is not likely to lure the indie band genre over country and western music or older rock cover bands. Diablo (another irony) Cody doesn't research her writing very well, among other things.Clearly shot in various locations, there were conspicuous inconsistencies. The opening shot showed Jennifer's house with a spacious lawn and a horse (grazing at night). But Needy's house was on a crowded street resembling a grubby suburb of Newark. Seconds later, Needy winds up on a narrow road flanked by dense forest. The montage identified Devil's Kettle as a small, rural town. So why does Colin get eaten in an abandoned row house? Needy's mom works in a factory (or something like that) but how many factory towns have only one bar? None of the pieces fit together as far as screen writing is concerned. I don't know what Cody was thinking. The production designer must have felt total frustration.There were several things that make no sense. Even with the help of Satan, no band can rise from oblivion to ""a sold-out national tour"" in the course of two months. With several grizzly murders, one might expect some form of involvement with the police. But there is nothing. Why were Needy's scars not questioned? Did she tender no defense? Why did Chip disregard Needy's pleading by walking to the dance alone, in an open field? This is completely opposite of his ordinary behavior. How could Needy go to the dance ""to keep an eye on Jennifer"" when Jennifer wasn't even there? Some of the directing was not what one might expect with such a good cast. This is yet another irony. The scenes with Jennifer approaching from a distance were boring and redundant. They added nothing. Low Shoulder played only one song, and the the part where Jennifer lures the foreign kid into the forest had no conclusion. If she ate him, why no funeral, why did she want to eat left overs from Boston Market? Why was there blood on her face? Being campy is another irony. Some of the ""black humor"" was so bad it was good. Furthermore, Devil's Kettle may be an apt name for a place where ""Satanic rituals"" would be played out. But how would an indie band from the city even know it existed? Why didn't the orange balls get sucked into the bottomless pit? How did the murder weapon avoid the falls conveniently for Needy to find?In spite of a ""discombobulated"" script, novice directing and tedious production designing, the cast made up for fundamental weaknesses in all areas. A good script, good direction and a mediocre cast doesn't work well either. Ordinarily, I would trash this movie. But, ironically, the cast and the one liners made it worthy of repeat viewing for me. . Therefore, my evaluation of 8 stars is ironic as well.",Jennifer's Body

212,morgan-davies-1,Harmless Teen Fun that Grosses You Out,8,5 August 2014,"Without mentioning spoilers, Jennifer's Body is a film about a girl who has a sweet tooth for boys' intestines. The comedy-horror flick is a mixture of badly laughable humour and cheap jump-scares that aren't anything you wouldn't find in your average Zombie attack B-Movie. But that's where the beauty of this film is. With Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody writing this film, it makes you more lenient towards its bad puns and catty humour. The film stars Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried, accompanied by Johnny Simmons and Ryan Levine along with other relatively small actors, but the casting is near perfect with the typical hot popular girl (Fox) and the nerdy best friend (Seyfried).Technically this film isn't great. The acting isn't amazing and the story is cliché but the indie rock soundtrack sets a casual mood for the film and the make-up effects are actually quite cringing (in a good way). I personally laughed quite a bit at the catty comebacks and the awkward sex scene.This film shouldn't be taken seriously as its just an angst-filled teen slasher flick and it's just a great film to watch for any time. You needn't invest any emotional attachment into the characters or story and yes, the film has quite noticeable flaws but that acts as part of its charm and despite it's dark and twisted characteristics, the film is light hearted and quirky.

I loved the story to this movie, I loved the way it was put together, and I loved every other character in this movie, but the fact that they went with the overly- 'hot' girl instead of the one that could pull the part off just ruined this movie all together for me.On the plus side, the movie had a great soundtrack and Amanda Seyfried did an excellent job in her role as the geeky yet sexual high school nerd. But on the whole, the negatives outweigh the positives, I would say its watchable if a friend pays for it or if you pirate movies, but don't spend money on it thinking you're going to get a good horror film, or if you think you're going to see more than Megan Foxes Belly Button.",Jennifer's Body

The characters dialog was very flat and while Juno like characters talking like hip, lazy text messengers works for the A.D.D. generation it gets tired real quick for me personally.

The oooonly thing that you may find OK are the moments when Megan Fox is normal and beautiful... When I think about...even her beauty can't help this monstrosity.,Jennifer's Body
222,buggy3001,Good comedy...wasn't it?,6,19 September 2009,"If you go in with expectations of a serious movie of some sort of classical approach to horror,etc or good acting/storyline, save your money.If you go in because there's no other movies out there to watch but the title might seem like fun, you might end up enjoying yourself.I personally laughed for roughly half the movie as did most of the audience. The story is predictable and doesn't make sense at all, the dialogue is triple cheese with ketchup on top, and the ""horror"" is really funny looking.That said, i finally got convinced that my $11 were worth it when the 2 girls started the kissing on the bed. I however wasn't the only one as the entire room started laughing really loudly when they heard me. The movie is great if you approach it as a B type with a scantily clad cliché bad chick.Getting down to some acting, Megan Fox did her part just fine as expected (you know, look good, cheesy 16 yr old chick lines), yet surprisingly the other girl actually pulled off a decent performance even with the horrendous dialogue.I wont even get into the storyline because its so ridiculous, i'm only giving this a 6 because, on the positive side it was funny, on the negative side its called Jennifer's Body but there wasn't enough of it...",Jennifer's Body
223,tayla_cant,Good,8,18 July 2021,"Definitely is a sleepover movie, it definitely gets better the more you watch it. It's one of those timeless classics but still feels like a 2000s movie. A bit too much gore for me so just beware of that if you don't like it.",Jennifer's Body
224,isaiahc-72408,A bit overrated but still ok,7,17 August 2021,"I liked the movie a lot in the first half. Then when the second half rolled around things just seemed odd and unreasonable. I didn't like the fact that Chip died and the fight sequence that led to it wasn't intriguing, but a bit dramatic. Then, Needy kills Jennifer which I can see why, but Jennifer was the best part of the movie for me and seeing her die in such a pathetic way was sad. This then leads to Needy gaining Jennifer's ""powers"" herself and escaping from prison using them. Although I think that was stupid, I did like that she went to go kill the band Low Shoulder, they deserved it. Needy was like-able and Jennifer was great for me. Megan Fox really made this movie in my opinion. 7.5/10.",Jennifer's Body
225,mindyfrostbite,A classic,10,30 October 2021,"Worth the watch. Throwing it back to 2009, this movie gave me an appreciation for Megan Fox as an actress; more than just (IRONICALLY - ""Jennifer's BODY"") her body/appearance.She's so fantastic at The Spooky in this movie; the (apparent?) blacklisting of her as an actress is a shame.The casting overall is excellent; the movie is a fantastic. Worth your time; watch it.",Jennifer's Body
226,trypanophobic34,The trailer does no justice to it at all!,8,4 October 2009,"I don't know why the trailer, especially the shorter one, is so awful, except maybe as a cheap lure for wider audiences or something. But it doesn't really tell you anything about the movie. That cheesy ""I will finish you. -Okay, you can't even finish gym class"" line doesn't appear in it. I thought this movie would be really bad from the trailer, but I still kind of wanted to see it for a few laughs, though I wasn't even sure it'd be entertaining because it seemed so bad. But what I got was something immensely enjoyable - definitely a nice surprise.Jennifer's Body is very well-done for its kind. And there's not really any other movie MUCH like it. Sure, it's a little cheesy, and overloaded with ridiculous teenage slang that no one even ever uses in real life, but that doesn't really detract from it. The movie has style, it's pretty dark, and it shows a wider slice of high school life than it might seem. Its value isn't just limited to teens, either; I think it has a wider appeal, again, than it might seem.The performances are great. Unlike in the trailer and most other movies like this, the characters actually respond to weird and horrible things that happen to them instead of it just kind of happening and them moving on with the action. The movie is much more emotional and realistic in this way than the trailer shows. Amanda Seyfried was wonderful as Needy, and Megan Fox gave a strong and captivating performance; she shows her acting abilities much more than in the Transformers movies. I heard some people on these boards before the movie was released talking about how they were just going to watch it to see Megan Fox topless - and I thought these were horrible and shallow people. Seriously... If that's all you're there for you probably won't get the movie. Her role in the movie is NOT just as some passive eye candy, with no acting, depth, or character.Jennifer is a likable character. She has some element of the bitchy vain hot girl in high school, but not a lot; there's more to her than that. She's not really a mean person. I felt for her. What I thought happened in the movie didn't exactly happen. Yeah, she's a demon or something like that, but it's not that she was always evil and Needy was just friends with her for some inexplicable reason or that she became an entirely different person. The real explanation they provide makes much more sense, and is much deeper and sadder; it's actually a good storyline. And I think the title ""Jennifer's Body"" will make more sense in the context of that explanation, rather than just seeming kind of blatant and referring to Jennifer's sex appeal.Most of the characters were pretty likable, including victims. Needy's boyfriend Chip is so nice, and a memorable character. The movie is not nearly so shallow in not going into people's real characters, emotions, and reactions. Again, I don't know why the trailer butchered it so much and showed the worst possible put-together glimpse of it. Even the visuals with Jennifer's demonic appearance aren't as cheesy as they look in the trailer.In conclusion, this movie is definitely worth seeing. It's different from every other movie, it's not exactly for everyone, not a ""Mean Girls"" sort of movie - only with demonic eating of boys or something. I think this is one of my favorite dark teen comedies. That might seem like a narrow category, but this movie is NOT narrow. It's interesting, engaging, well-done visually and story-wise, well acted, with depth and uncommon style, and totally enjoyable. I'm so glad I caught it instead of passing it over! I will definitely want to see it again.",Jennifer's Body
227,ssallazzar,What the ...?,1,22 September 2009,"Worst movie i have ever seen , the script was absurd most of the time, i would say ""see it to believe it "" but it would cause a conflict of interest . How could they make something like this , what we're the actors thinking when they read the script ? it probably must have a white check attached to it . The acting ... well the thing is there was none , and the way the scenes we're put together they made no sense at all.Just don't see this movie , the only thing it shows is how low the producers/director can degrade themselves into a pathetic attempt to make a quick buck .",Jennifer's Body
228,southsidepopper,What I Was Expecting,5,15 January 2010,"Coming into this movie I was already thinking it wasn't going to be a good movie. My opinion was this movie is only popular because it has Megan Fox in little to no clothes, and it turns out I was absolutely right. The storyline of this movie was all over the place, leaving you confused for quite a bit of the movie. And the plot, an indie rock band's sacrifice to the devil for stardom goes wrong, wow, if I would have known that was the plot I would have never even bothered to watch this movie. The acting throughout the movie was never believable for the circumstances, which shows very much so in what was supposed to be the dramatic climax of the movie, the pool scene. In that scene there are so many different things going on, and instead of trying to do some good acting to portray the events, they make some very crude and stupid jokes, one in particular about a tampon. Another thing that really bothered me was the stupid girlie talk throughout the movie. There were a few scary scenes in the movie, but not nearly enough. If you like stupid horror movies that are more funny, in a bad way, then scary, then this movie is for you. But if you feel like seeing a decent movie just skip this one.",Jennifer's Body
229,speleorat2003,"Demons and high school and lesbians, oh my",7,25 January 2010,"A movie that almost lost me before it even got started. The movie starts out with one of the principles in an insane asylum, explaining in a voice-over how she got there. But then, the film almost collapses under the weight of some truly excruciating dialogue where it appears that screenwriter Diablo Cody was just forcing more and more teenage clichés and pop culture references into each line along with a sly little nudge and a wink to the viewer as if to show just how truly hip and with it she can actually be. Absolutely god awful. Subtle as a flying mallet and like a bad, bad episode of Buffy, or something. The roadhouse fire scene, too, was clumsy and rather awkwardly executed. But as the film finally slowly edged into horror territory, although the dialogue didn't change character, it then gained a counter point. Which made it ever so much better. You have to wonder why people simply stood and watched the roadhouse slowly catch fire, all around them though. Not that most horror movies have ever had a stranglehold on reality. Even so, after the punishing dialogue, it was almost too much. Just about tipped the balance, for me. But after that scene, what was horrible before slowly became comic relief, and the movie finally found its' legs.Most of the move after that worked, except for that utterly pointless and inexplicable lesbian kiss scene between Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried. I suppose that was shoehorned in for the fanboys to try to compensate for the total lack of nudity that the audience for this movie had to be expecting. I mean, come on. It's Megan Fox, for crying out loud. There.... has....to be nudity. There... just has to! Um, no, not really.Where this movie ultimately succeeded in was it's unconventionality. It took your expectations and turned them on their collective ear. You expected nudity but didn't get it. Particularly in light of the fact the chief protagonist was a succubus, a female demon spirit that preys on men by luring them to their doom with the promise of sex. And business was very good indeed. You also expected a lot more gore than you got. The movie only marginally had more gore in it than your average PG-13 movie. Then there was the contrast between the ""virgin"" sacrifice at the waterfall and the integration of an old hackneyed Tommy Tutone song into the scene that was beautifully written with a wonderful interplay going on between the actors before the scene comes to a sudden, jarring halt. Nice. There was more to like about than that but, I'll satisfy myself with that description, so as to save you, dear reader, some mystery. That scene, though, nailed it and neatly encapsulated what this film did right. And mostly, overall, Jennifer's Body did that. After a rough start. Throw in a little ongoing psychological examination within the movie of why girls hang out with ""best friends"" who treat them like dirt, but forgive all and still hang around for more as though they were in some kind of female version of boot camp in training for the relationships they would seek later in life, and you have a fairly interesting little artifact of the new millennium.Damned if the movie didn't remind me of the old Julie Brown video to ""The Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun"", though. High school evil, but not evil evil. See it.",Jennifer's Body
230,castrobear,Surprisingly GOOD!,8,22 May 2010,"Rented ""Jennifer's Body"" not knowing anything about it and was pleasantly surprised. The cross between HEATHERS, CARRIE and dozen or so teenage slasher flicks with Diablo Cody's ""finger on the pulse"" teen language script made this a FUN viewing. I loved the cameo appearances by Amy Sedaris and Cynthia Stevenson and more. It's a real shame that peple (critics) were expecting more of diablo after her Oscar win for 'Juno"".The is a solid,fun, VERY 'R"" rated film that deserves a viewing.If I were a teenager I probably would have a copy of ""Jennifer's Body"" stashed under my mattress!!!",Jennifer's Body
231,RonniBrant,Enough already...,6,1 March 2010,"All the hate on this movie is getting stupid. It's not the height of cinematic artistry...nor is it the worst friggin' movie of the year. And PLEASE stop comparing this movie to Juno. We're talking apples and oranges when it comes to directors and acting talent. Juno had the best of everything to support that hackneyed script. Jennifer's Body did not.Now, I'm pretty sick of Hollywood giving me the hard sell on Megan Fox. She can barely deliver a line...and she's ""average night club tramp"" attractive. I'm not saying she's ugly. I'm just saying she ain't all that.Fortunately, the role of Jennifer wasn't very demanding. All she had to do was look slutty (which she pulled off just fine) and smile covered in blood (oooo...what amazing acting chops that required).The other actors did their part...but let's not pretend that this movie is anything but a vehicle to further sell us on Megan Fox as the sex symbol of today. I won't blow sunshine up anyone's butt. They all did the best they could with the crappy dialog and cliché character sketches handed to them. Amanda Seyfried was fun. The dude that played her b/f was the best actor in the movie and I'd never heard of him 'til now.The direction was not bad. In fact, I think the director did about as well as could be done with that script and talent pool. The scenes were well shot and the look of the movie was very nice. Karyn Kusama managed to make an enjoyable movie despite all it's shortcomings. No small feat. Kudos to her.Also, kudos to Diablo Cody (god, how does she expect anyone to take her seriously with that pen name) for the story itself. It was a fresh take on the whole possession thing. She is clearly a better plotter than a writer. She should consider collaborating with someone who writes better dialog.I won't be watching it a dozen times like some of my favorite movies. But I enjoyed it and would gladly recommend it to anyone in the mood for a little cheesy fun.",Jennifer's Body

Megan fox does nothing other than kissing guys and murdering them throughout the movie.. this lady's hot presence makes us forget the flaws in the movie for a while.. but when you clear your mind and get away from the Megan fox's illusion you'll feel the dumbness of this movie... i think the director thought that he can give a hit if just makes his hot heroine walk all around, unzip her tops, kiss everyone she feels likes and stuffs.. we have been told that Jennifer will look pale if she is empty.. but there are scenes in which in shot she'll look pale and in another with her full make up... sense less...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you wanna see it just for Megan .. don't go to theaters.. wait for some one to upload those videos in you-tube..!!",Jennifer's Body

""Jennifer's Body"" avoided all of the tiring clichés used in generic ""teen scream"" horror flicks. It had a great plot and a great ending that leaves you feeling a sense of satisfactory. Maybe you think Megan Fox is a bad actress. Well, actually, I would say that she gave a good performance in the movie. Plus, the gore/violence wasn't over-the-top, and there isn't an enormous body count like in other modern horror films. Those are just stupid, while ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't stupid. The film is practically a horror-comedy, so you don't have to really take it seriously (which you probably wouldn't anyway, considering that it's a Megan Fox horror film).

235,kookoo36,CRIMINALLY Underrated,9,30 September 2021,"Super weird seeing all of these 2009 reviews saying this is ""terrible"" and ""one of time the worst movies of all time"", and I was confused until I read that this film apparently had a botched marketing rollout where the film was either advertised as a straight-up horror or a Megan Fox sex appeal feature, and.... it is neither of these things.Fortunately, I was too young in 2009 to remember seeing any marketing for this film. In fact, I hadn't even heard of it until a few years ago, and thought it was maybe a low-budget Megan Fox horror movie pre-Transformers or something. I was looking for a film to watch the other night, and this popped up, so I checked it out. And MAN I was pleasantly surprised.This film is really a very clever horror comedy about two teen girls, best friends since childhood, who find themselves starting to butt heads and drift apart. And all of this is accentuated when ... I'll just say something not normal (maybe even demonic) happens to one of them.First off, Megan Fox is phenomenal in this film, and I really mean that. Apparently she was nominated for a Razzie for this movie?!!!?!!! Like what the hell?!!!! 2009 must have had the Megan Fox hate train moving full steam ahead, because that is crap. This is the best performance I have ever seen her pull off. She's funny, evil, sexy, and even very subtle when the moment calls for it. I was thoroughly impressed with her performance and this film honestly made me respect her a lot more as an actress.Of course, Amanda Seyfreid is fantastic as always as her best friend. She goes completely over the top in many places, but in the best way possible. I had no idea Diablo Cody wrote this film until the credits rolled, and it made total sense when I saw that. Yeah, she has that ""this is what high schoolers say, but not really"" way of writing dialogue, but it really works here. In fact, I know Juno won her an Oscar or whatever, but I think her dialogue in this film is better... just saying.So, yeah. It's shot really well. All of the actors are great, Diablo Cody's script is the glue that holds it together, the song choices are excellent, and did I mention the villains in this movie are basically an evil version of the band The Killers? Yeah, there's that too. I have NO idea why people have been sleeping on this movie for so long, but I'm going to start recommending it to people. It is that good.",Jennifer's Body

I don't even know how this movie got higher reviews than other great horror movies out there. Well, one idea is that people just loved it because of Megan Fox and the other is that the fact that people might also have really dense minds that didn't mind most of the stupidity in this film. Megan Fox did not do a splendid job at acting. This movie seems to aim for very dense minds of teens rather than try to put out a good movie in general. Short lines with some teen humor. This was almost on the verge of a teen horror movie spoof. Sorry, but I've never picked a cast or cast member over acting or a good storyline/plot. If a hot bod really made a good movie, a lot of B-movies out there wouldn't be considered a B-movie. If you want a dumb teen ""horror"", this movie is for you. If you want an actual horror movie that is good, look elsewhere.",Jennifer's Body

First of all, this review contains SPOILERS! This is a horror comedy with a razor sharp script and beautiful music video footage. A lot of the latter part of the movie feels kind of like a Rammstein video - in a good way. But the thing that I like best with this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It doesn't take itself too serious. I suppose that you could compare it to 'The Faculty', although I'd say this one's a lot better. But the movie that I think is most appropriate to compare it to is the eighties movie 'Heathers'. And I believe that it's a fair comparison and that 'Jennifer's Body' is just as good.

I feel if they dived deeper into the satanic motive by the band who sacrificed Jennifer would not have been awful, and there def was a lack of body count.

Although Megan Fox lost weight and didn't go in the sun for a while blah blah blah she still didn't look like a teenager. Huge flaw right there. Should have found someone else for that role.

Listening to the same stuff for 1h40min...I'm glad I watched it on Youtube and didn't spend my money on the ticket! NOT WORTH IT.

And I was pleasantly surprised, I really did love it! It clearly isn't going to win any Oscars, but it is simply a good, witty and slightly jumpy film. It should be viewed as a cross-genre film rather than purely just horror.The screenplay was well written, with the banter between characters being rather witty and clever. The overall characterisation was well cast, with all playing each part very well. Amanda Seyfried was the perfect fit for her character. Seeing her go from a held-back geeky friend to the more edgier, murdering type by the end of the film didn't seem fake nor cheesy. Jennifer's character really wouldn't have fitted anyone else but Megan Fox for this role. Obviously she was cast due to her looks but still, she plays the self-centred teen very well. (I was beginning to hate her half way through!) Adam Brody's appearance was quite a shocker to say the least. His image reminded me of a young Brandon Flowers and he played the egotistical yet dark character of Nikolai well. He definitely deserved what he got at the end!Definitely not to be taken serious!

Question is though, how many of these haters actually saw the film? Judging from it's box office take, very few. Aside from Tarantino's Basterds, Jennifer's Body was the most anticipated movie of the year for me. Diablo Cody has had me hooked ever since her wonderful book Candy Girl years ago, then with Juno she cemented proof that this woman is no joke, and once again it pays off with Jennifer. Amanda Seyfried caught my attention in Mean Girls, and I've loved her ever since, and she shined in Jennifer. Finally, there's Megan Fox, someone who seems to just have to sit there to be hated by many. Jealousy fills so many with rage. She doesn't say all the right things that we expect from celebrities, and somehow this causes even more hatred. Curiosity and the fact that she's the reason 'wow' is in our vocabulary, has kept me interested, and the hatred from everyone for nothing made me even more. Put all three of these people together and you've got Jennifer's Body. It's fun, silly, disturbing, wild, sexy, and one of the best movies of the year.

248,killdestroy,What's all the fuss about?,5,30 November 2009,"I don't really want to be one of those people who hears ""Diablo Cody"" and waits for something Juno-ish to come my way. If something or someone new suddenly emerges out of the giant porn studio that is Hollywood these days, I really hope that after the first breakthrough it will deliver something entirely new next time.Having seen Juno, I was hoping that Diablo Cody was going to bring something fresh to modern American cinema. But having seen Jennifer's Body, it helped me realize exactly how dependant the outcome of any film is on the director. If it wasn't Jason Reitman directing Juno, casting those great actors, picking out that music and all in all, doing an amazing job at working together with all of his departments in order to make that film as authentic as possible, it might have flopped. And if it wasn't Karyn Kusama directing Jennifer's Body, it might have been a success.Watching the film, I couldn't help but notice how forced every single scene was. The dialogue felt chunky, the action scenes - clichés, the music didn't seem to work with what was going on inside the shot and pretty much everything else in this picture made me think that Karyn Kusama was out of her element when she was making this film.But, for me, Diablo Cody isn't entirely without fault.

249,tanjareen-1,Interesting...but could have been better,6,3 November 2009,"I think the movie was alright. It definitely had some interesting ideas and Diablo Cody IS a talented writer, even though i didn't like ALL lines (especially the 'tit'-line in the end wasn't as funny as they might have thought it would be). There were some marvellous camera shots...i especially remember the scene were Colin walks into the house and we get a shot of the whole street...it was kind of Freddy Krueger-ish and old-school but still very atmospheric. The music and the pictures showed an artistic side to the film which should not be overlooked. BUT the story itself lacked a bit of depth for me. The plot could have been more complex, adding more information about how something like this could happen and why the band got away with it and it wouldn't have destroyed the rather simple idea of the movie (this might seem like a contradiction, but in my head it isn't). I don't understand why Jennifer didn't want to kill the band because they were the ones who did that to her.Even though it is supposed to be a horror comedy, the characters could still have been explored a little bit more (i think they did a good job in 'the faculty' for example). In the end, you couldn't really see a character difference between the possessed and the normal Jennifer. The only difference was that she became a killer, but it seemed as if she already was a bitch before and that her character didn't much change even though she was now possessed by a demon.I don't want to overanalyze this movie. It was entertaining and weird...which isn't necessarily a bad thing...and it had an 'indi'vibe to it because of the way it was told. But it could have been much better.As for Megan Fox: I'm a girl and i think she's alright.(no hate here, no jealousy because she really IS very pretty) I love the Transformer movies and as a part of these i can deal with her always being the HOT CHICK (even though they tend to overdo her 'sexy scenes'). But I really hope that one day we might see her in a different, more complex role and that will be the day that I can decide if she really is a good actress. She still did a good job here though and Seyfried was alright, too.If you wanna see a somehow 'different' film that still sticks to the genre of horror comedy, you should check 'Jennifer's Body' out.",Jennifer's Body

251,sbrooke1980,Hugely underrated & misunderstood.,8,5 June 2021,"I didn't want to see this because it seems like it was marketed as a B ""Sleepaway Camp"" with T&A thrown in for the men and little substance. Megan Fox IS a stunner. At one point Jennifer says ""I feel so scrumptious!"" And I was thinking, ""Well that's a spot-on description"". But both Fox and Seyfried are so much more than their exterior and I decided to give it a chance because I find I generally love everything with Amanda Seyfried (and I like Kyle Gallner, too). This is a movie for adults about high school kids. It's hilarious and smart (and I usually hate things labeled ""smart""), and the cheesy anthem you hear throughout is a heck of an earworm and surprisingly catchy considering the cliche lyrics (I think it is supposed to feel that way- like they wrote what they thought would sell without putting any thought into the lyrics). You'll find yourself thinking about so many parts of this movie long after it's over, especially the fantastic dialogue. It's not really a horror and not just a comedy, definitely more satire and tongue in cheek that doesn't take itself too seriously but still seriously entertaining. I hate blood & guts horrors, have always preferred psychological horror and even the graphic scenes here are great- just enough gore to get it across and the cgi is used sparingly and not at all distracting. This is a fun movie and one you'll find yourself recommending and wanting to watch again and even again. If you haven't given it a chance yet, it's definitely one of those movies you thought would be stupid but is actually pretty great.",Jennifer's Body

253,nancyelaine-51363,Amusing Creature Feature,9,9 May 2019,"Jennifer's Body might, at times, be too clever for its own good, but at least it has a point of view and a few interesting things to say. Sure, Diablo Cody's writing can veer into the precious and twee every now and then, but the story is interesting and well played by Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox as two childhood best friends who are being torn apart by beauty, social status, boys, and demons. There are some cute one-liners here and there and a funny bit of social satire about how news outlets cover small town tragedy, but the horror elements never really pop. Thankfully, the rest is so entertaining that you might not mind.",Jennifer's Body
254,ramonatutuianu,comedy gold,10,29 December 2020,"The dialogue is so cheesy but I laughed out loud. So many scenes start off really scary and you think it's going into a really serious direction because the performance is serious, like they are showing strong, tragic emotions, and then Jennifer says: Ouch! My tit! It's hilarious! And Collin's mom putting the goth kids in their place at his funeral... I was in tears. I thought I was in South Park at that point. The reason I like Jennifer as a character, is not because of her supernatural powers, it's because she's so mean and manipulative, and you can totally see that happening in real life. I mean the movie is so realistic on portraying their friendship, but so ridiculous with the horror elements and the cheesy lines, it's one of a kind, never seen such a successful quirky blend of genres.

She broke down and told him everything and that didn't matter at all when Jennifer approached him. All it took was a little white lie and her man was taken. That quickly. This girl is running through the woods looking a mess for a boy who was about to sleep with her best friend. No boy that age is going to a secluded area with a girl at night with no intention of doing anything. I was so happy when he died. I literally cheered at the screen. ""You killed my boyfriend""....

256,leetwanker,A refreshing bit of originality.,7,28 December 2009,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm very critical of movies, the Horror genre in particular. Whether it be bad acting, unrealistic dialog, or just a crap plot, it doesn't take much for me to dislike it, and being that it seems that every other movie that comes out is another horror flick, it takes something special for me to enjoy it.However with this movie I didn't go in with very high expectations and was very pleasantly surprised. It's a different type of movie, they don't spend all their energy trying to get you to jump out of your seat, they just tell what is a pretty good story save the ending, which was a bit of a stinker. That and I could have done with some nudity, it would've fit rather well in this flick. There's plenty of beauties that can act that don't have a problem stripping down for a well done skin scene, because you just know that Megan Fox is never going to deliver.So, just as long as you don't go into it with super-high expectations, I think you'll enjoy it.Justin",Jennifer's Body

258,nathan-taurus,An Interesting Take on High School Horror,8,16 June 2010,"Reviewing a movie is always going to be difficult as the scores are always the reviewers opinion and not everyone is going to agree. This is my opinion of 'Jennifer's Body' and therefore cannot be seen as that helpful or not helpful because everyone is different. I will not be writing a plot outline for the film as you can get an in depth analysis elsewhere.I quite enjoyed the movie and feel that many of the attacks on it are unjustified....some, however, are. The difficult thing about the film is that it is attempting to be different genres at the same time (Horror/Comedy) and it does succeed at both on occasion but drops the ball on others. If you are a die hard horror fan and love to see blood and guts and gore than this isn't your film. If you think Adam Sandler is still funny than chances are you won't like this either.I found this movie to be funnier than most comedies of the past (Superbad, Any Jonah Hill film, The Hangover,..etc) and it isn't that funny. As I mentioned in brackets I saw this film on a flight from LA to Sydney and also watched 'The Hangover' and 'Indiana Jones 4' and I found 'Jennifer's Body' to be exceptionally better than them.If you want to watch a fairly original, unique film that is light on horror with good performances (Amanda Seyfried, Adam Brody), a little odd that could have been a cult success with a little tweaking, then this is good. If you want to watch Megan Fox than this is the film...don't watch 'Transformers 2' as that was an accidental comedy.",Jennifer's Body
259,snowflakeinyourpalm,both great and horrible,5,26 October 2010,"Have just watched Jen's Body. WHY? Well, I was sick, indoors and in need of entertainment. Unfortunately, I couldn't even go buy myself some popcorn and at one point I was aching for some, but it was still a good treat without it. The thing is that I'm really confused now: should I give it a fair 7 for the laughs I had watching it or a generous 3 for the actual... film. And now, on with the spoilers...Where do I even start... Jen (the one whom everyone wants to be or be with) and her dorky, needy friend named... Needy, have been BFFs for their entire lifetimes. They have nothing in common, but, then again, in Devil's Kettle (yeah, that's where they live), they seem to make up 90% of the female population, so it's kind of predictable that they'd be friends. Needy is dating this nice young boy every mom wishes her daughter would bring home, Chip, and Jen, well she's not much into dating, she's more of an... action oriented person. The story, as short as possible: concert - rock band – fire - Jen kidnapped – returns to Needy growling and barfing black liquid – starts eating people (mainly guys, and this goes on throughout the film, the rest is not very relevant) – attacks Chip(the above mentioned boyfriend of the dork – Needy goes crazy – girls fight in Jen's bedroom – Needy stabs Jen with a paper cutter right in her heart (now that takes precision!) – mommy enters (where was she in all the other scenes, social services should do something about her) – Needy goes to the loony bin – Needy discovers demon powers rubbed off on her – Needy flies out of the loony bin and butchers the rock band – the end.But the film is really fun and enjoyable. I mean watching how Jen transitions from a growling and barfing prehistorical creature to a normal teen in just half a night (without any explanations) and then getting to see her excellent table manners ( yes, she does get naked to kill the guys, but still, she manages to splash blood all over the place except on her clothes) is a real treat. I mean, we can learn from that; I know I have problems even when I'm eating something medium rare. Oh an the tongue burning scene is so completely and utterly pointless!I must say that one of my favorite scenes is when she starts sipping blood from that emo guy's stomach as if it were some sort of wonder spring. Oh course, there is an entire prelude before she actually gets to the sipping part; first she lures the unsuspecting hormone charged teen, then she takes off half her clothes to make sure the guy really wants her (as if that's really necessary), then she pulls all sorts of tricks to scare the pants off him (like changing her eye color) and only then does she start to devour her already suspecting prey. Then, I really need to mention I just love the town they're living in. Devil's Kettle – sounds lovable, doesn't it? This Devil's Kettle (I just love repeating it) is the perfect teen town. In Devil's Kettle, the town where they have this weird waterfall where you can throw things in and they never surface – or so the scientist have found in all their research, that included throwing plastic balls which looked like poor Christmas decorations in it, there are no parents in sight. Not when children are murdered in broad day light, not when someone/something is growling in their kitchen. No parents, I tell you. Oh, except for the end when, after what seems like half an hour of window breaking, furniture cracking, cat-fight, with all the screaming one can imagine when Jen's mom finally decides to check on her already stabbed demon daughter. Speaking of whom (or which, because she's not really human), why does she feel the need to lie? I mean, she tells Needy ""I eat guys... mm, they're so yummy"" and then goes all little-goody-two- shoes?! And if ""someone"" wanted to portray duality, conflict between the two immaterial things living inside the same body, well that's just too much for this film, honestly. And impossible for that matter, I mean she died so the real soul was very much gone before the demon revitalized the butchered pieces of Jennifer.One more incredibly interesting fact about Devil's Kettle (frankly I'm surprised nothing happened there until now) is how that little God forsaken town has the most complete book collection on occultism, conveniently divided into the following sections: ""white magic"", ""black magic"" and ""whatever the character may need"", so that Needy easily finds everything she needs on the demon possessing Jen and all the details about killing it (I wonder what section that book was in).At the end we see how Needy flies out of the loony bin, finds the place where the never surfacing waterfall surfaces, grabs the knife which was used by the rockers to sacrifice Jen and off she goes to sacrifice the Low Shoulder band members (who should have been called Slow instead of Low). All this being said and done, we (or, at least I) end up wondering: how ever can someone choose Jennifer as being the virgin and not Needy?But seriously now, beyond all that, the film does exactly what it's supposed to do: be an enjoyable, popcorn, teen horror flick.",Jennifer's Body
260,lostinafantasy86,It Held My Attention,7,5 January 2010,"When I watch movies, all I ask is to be entertained. This movie did just that. It held my attention the entire way through. I will admit that there were a few scenes where I may have rolled my eyes, and wondered why they felt the need to take certain scenes in certain directions.First, I must say I adored Adam Brody in this film. I have always been a fan of him since his O.C. days, and I enjoyed the few moments in this film where ""Seth Cohen"" came shining through! Being an emo rock god works for him...he had my attention, that's for sure! Now on to the film. I sat here and read most the board posts and while I was quite enthralled by all the interpretive views of the film, I will review as I saw it. What a fantastic idea Diablo! High school is hell and so are teenage girls, as was pointed out in the very beginning. Many girls in high school had that one friend who you knew was prettier, more popular. And although you were friends, you were secretly jealous of her more. This movie did a great job depicting that. It was a fun movie, and semi-relatable. Minus all the demon crap. I wasn't that thrilled with either of the female characters, I found myself getting more annoyed than anything. Although the quote from Jennifer ""I Am A God"" cracked me up a bit, if for no other reason then it being random. The dialogue was very Juno-esquire, that's for sure. I mean who says ""salty"" and can do so without cracking up? I did enjoy the relationship between Needy and Chip (who I loved in this movie, he was great). I wanted so bad for them to live happily ever after, but that dang Jennifer just had to take a chunk out of his neck...if for no other reason but to prove to Needy, she could have and do whatever she wanted. Which seemed to be the main theme of the movie. It was always Jennifer speaking as if or trying to prove that she was an irresistible force in their school. No one had a chance up against her, including her supposed ""BFF"". And that was even BEFORE the demon took her over...All in all if you are looking for jump out of your skin scary, this isn't your movie. As a matter of fact, it wasn't scary at all...at least not in my opinion. But if you think Megan Fox is hot, you like lesbian scenes, you remember high school and could relate to this, or you're looking for an all around fun movie, then I recommend renting it. I would never buy it, it's not that good, but it's worth the 4 or 5 dollars!",Jennifer's Body
261,subase,"Quite boring, saved by its two leads and a bit of blood.",6,4 April 2010,"Jennifer's Body seems to suffer from a bad script and directing, not sure which is worse. It's only saving graces are Amanda Seyfried who manages to insert quite a lot of depth and emotion into her character named 'Needy', alongside her is Megan Fox who although not as successful still manages to give her incredibly cliché and unoriginal written character of a bitchy cheerleader and best friend, some weight and impact. Every other character in the film apart from a nice Adam Brody playing out of character is either farcical or forgettable.Without Megan and more importantly Seyfried this film would have been unwatchable.The main problem is the director can't figure out what type of movie this is (blame the stupid script), is it about teen friendship or romance?, is it a comedy?, is it at times a thriller? a horror? skin flick? No one, me included really knows. The director showed similar problems although to a much less degree in Aeon Flux.As a tale of friendship between girls, it is either nonsensical or cynical. As a romance it is superficial. As a comedy it is not funny. As a satire it isn't funny and not deep enough. As a drama it has unbelievable elements and bad dialogue. The film does have some interesting scenes and themes but they are too deeply buried in boring irrelevancy or 'hip' contradiction to muster the necessary interest required to dig them up.What can I say, it was a good idea, but it's just a bad film and left me feeling empty and cheated.

The ""scary"" scenes aren't scary; there is a lot of over the top gore. Essentially, this movie mocks teen horror flicks. It plays off of the emo trend to create ironic humor, and the laughs come when you least expect them. It also has a respectable soundtrack. If you've yet to see this, I recommend it as a rental for a night in. You will be entertained. Please realize that this is a comic gem full of snark and wit, and don't expect to be frightened.

She can't act too well either but that's not the problem with this film.It's another vampire type movie almost like the Howling at times but without the awesome visuals and werewolves.I could list many things wrong with this film but I would be here all day. OK heres a few: -Attack scenes are cut while goofy sex scenes are left in. -The film feels like it ends at the 40 minute mark. -The lead singer wipes a bloody knife off on his jacket before he throws it away. -It focuses more on sex than it does on satanic ritual induced state. -It is jam packed with horrible goofy one-liners. -There are a lot of directorial mistakes and a lot of just plain Ole boring vampire neck bites and screams. -Teens don't go after 30 year old bar singers, they think they're creepy , trust me. -And it should be illegal for a supposed teenager to reveal that she has anal sex, unless it's Cybil. This film just puts everything bad about teenage horror flicks into one movie.

265,wolfmorrison,"Good idea, bad execution.",5,28 January 2011,"I loathed Juno, so I was surprised that I was entertained at all by this movie. But, I did look at it with an open mind. Also, when you sum up the plot, it sounds like a real scream, of both laughter and terror.Really underwhelming emo indie band of idiots sacrifice a mean-spirited teenage slut who they mistake for a virgin so that Satan will grant them the boon of money and fame. Then, the aforementioned ho becomes flesh-eating succubus, since she was not a virgin to begin with. The task of dispatching the succubus falls to the demon's put-down, put-upon and timid best friend.Sounds good. Most of the movie is funny and gory, especially Jennifer's unbelievable stupidity. She's so dumb she doesn't even realise she is some kind of undead creature. And the twist of a woman making male teenagers into ""lasagna with teeth"" as one character says, is very entertaining.You can merrily roll along with the movie, which is of the so bad it's good variety, laughing through its mean-spiritedness, until the final third, which makes and attempt at pathos when Jennifer kills her best friend Needy's boyfriend, Chip.All of the sudden it becomes an emotional drama about the death of the man that Needy loves. After i have been led to think I am watching a horror comedy, I do not like having sloshy sentiments thrust upon me in the last reel.Which is not to mention how the expected climax, Needy's murder of the idiot emo band takes place mostly off-screen and all we get to see are some jump-cuts over the credits.Also, what was up with the obligatory lesbian scenes? All in all, the movie had some great moments, but after the death of the fuzzy-bunny boyfriend, which was very depressing, you were unable to have any more fun with the film, and it not only fell apart in the last reel, but also ended in an abrupt and unsatisfying fashion.I would have given the movie four stars but for the scene in which Low Shoulder scarifies Jennifer to Satan.

266,NoGreenGus,Artless and Adolescent,1,22 January 2010,"Don't bother with this one. The filmmakers haven't evolved enough artistically and it's grossly apparent in this picture. The film demonstrates a pubescent and uncultivated attitude in the acting, writing, and directing. I'm a fan of quirky, offbeat horror and comedic horror flicks, but this film is trying way too hard. It's as if the filmmakers themselves are as infantile as the two main characters. The viewer gets the feeling that the actors, in a sense, aren't permitted to act. Rather, they're being exploited in order to advertise the attitudes and personalities of those behind the camera. This technique will always reveal itself as amateurish in a film. Many writers and directors will fall into this trap, whether it's by design or unintentionally (in this film, the latter seems to be the case). A film like ""Jennifer's Body"" can't take itself seriously and must be aware of itself as a film. Because it tries too hard at being smart and inventive, the end result comes out comical and juvenile. In other words, it comes out artless.",Jennifer's Body

The characters are likable and Mamma Mia's Amanda Seyfried is great as Jennifer's best friend Needy.The poster describes it as Mean Girls meets Lost Boys and that's a pretty good summary, though it's better than I'd imagined. There's more than enough here to keep both men and women amused, whether or not you like horror films or teen comedies!

273,BarrisDarkly,Feels like an imitation,10,23 May 2010,"On many different levels, this feels like an imitation. It doesn't seem like a real Diablo Cody film -- in ""Juno"", there was a realistic depiction of teenagers (I'm a teen, so I guess I should know) but in ""Jennifer's Body"", it feels more like a studio suit wrote it, using ""Juno"" as a basis for what teens are like. Many lines seems like someone wrote them thinking ""THIS is what a teen would say."" The dialogue is vaguely similar to ""Juno"", it is witty and biting, but this is in a much more contrived way. One character has the line ""It's on the wikipedia."" Wtf? Also, nearly every scene that was set in the school felt like an imitation of scenes out of ""Donnie Darko."" And beyond writing, in directing his entire film feels very ""Donnie Darko""-influenced. I wouldn't go so far as to say rip-off, but very similar at least. There is also some clear ""Lost Boys"" influence.As far as acting goes, it's all around good. Megan Fox makes her character easy to hate, but when needed also sympathetic. Johnny Simmons, whom I had never heard of before this (and going in I was thinking ""He should be played by Paul Dano"") proved to be a much better actor than I was suspecting. And of course I thought Amanda Seyfried did great, but I may be bias, lol.All in all, I would say ""Jennifer's Body"" is not just another teen horror film, writing and directing being much better than the typical teen horror film, but this is because of imitations of excellent materials. The acting is all around great, and Fox and Seyfried make for good eye candy to boot. The film might one day have a place among the cult classics, and I rather did enjoy it, but I say the jury will be out on the final verdict for about... 10 years.",Jennifer's Body

The movie has a terrible cast that punch it out, as well as extremely cliché'd scenarios and dialogue that you've heard in every song and movie that's been popular since the 90's. It had a various amount of 'Family Guy' styled jokes, using flashbacks with random highlights, which, don't work in a movie that's supposed to be serious.. actually, that was half of the problem with the film. I had no idea if the movie was meant to be a joke, or if it was a serious attempt-at-remake-of-'Species'.The movie was very fast-paced, which was a good thing, because I just wanted the film to get done with, haha. I admit going into the theater with a mildly optimistic preparation for the film, so what I got handed in return, was complete crap.However, I do admit, I have seen films that were much worse.Although the film was very plain, cliché'd, and, well, boring as Hell, it still was entertaining in one form or another, whether it be from admiring the patheticness of the film, or if you actually enjoyed over-styled, unnecessary violence involving two hot girls with no acting skills.To simply put it, I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone, but if someone was interested in seeing it, I wouldn't tell them not to.3/10, being lenient.""Megan Fox would do better in the silent film era."" -Me, just saying, haha.",Jennifer's Body
276,murtaghcity,What a let down !,4,19 November 2009,"Jeeez, don't the hype and adverts sometimes fool ya ! Very let down by this. Take away the pop culture references and geeky dialogue and you're left with a bog standard teen horror. There's no justification for the film title, except for its ability to sucker guilible teen males in. I can't recall being so disappointed in a long time. A horror movie, written by a woman, directed by a woman - I had high hopes indeed for something a little fresh in this well worn genre. Sadly, my hopes were dashed. The dynamic between Jenifer and Needy wasn't exactly plausible to start with, for the basic reason that girls like Jennifer, in real life, don't hang with nerds like Needy. The script struggled to get over that basic truth. As a horror flick it fails to excite, the set pieces are ones we've all seen before and the climax has been done so many times too. Teen boys will love the girl on girl action but as a female writer myself, I can't believe something so bland has been churned out here, given the (female) talent involved. Have to wonder if the studio cut the film according to its most likely demograph ??! Not worth seeing at the cinema, or rushing out for on DVD.",Jennifer's Body
277,deathlightdb,This movie only has a 5 average BECAUSE MEGAN FOX.,1,11 August 2016,"This movie is an atrocity to both men and women everywhere. I knew getting into this, that there would be all kinds of sexual clichés lobbed against women. I literally watched this just so I could have something to point to, when people whined at me for saying that Megan Fox is a skank. I mean, anyone who doesn't think she's a complete prostitute really needs to read her interviews here on IMDb. She basically says it herself, she just uses wordplay to make it sound less obvious. But people I talk to often aren't willing to read interviews, so I will simply have this film to point out that NO woman with ANY degree of self respect would take the role of the protagonist in this movie. IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT UNDERAGE SEX AND SEXUAL PREDATION. Who would WANT to put their name on that? But to my surprise, it wasn't just the women who were treated moronically. It was EVERYONE. Even the men in this movie are thrown under the bus, and portrayed as moronic stereotypes. There are only two types of dude in this movie: sexual predator or dumb-ass who sleeps with anything that shoves breasts in his face. This movie makes it out as though you can just walk up to a guy, shake your rack a little, and he'll take his pants off. So this movie is equally offensive to both genders.Beyond that, I watched this movie a couple of months ago, and then forgot about it. Very promptly. Saying that it's forgettable is akin to saying lard is high in saturated fat. The only reason I remembered it at all, was because I was cleaning my ""to watch"" list of movies I'd actually, you know, watched. It's probably not a one-star movie, probably a two or a three, because in spite of the terrible stereotypes and clichés and horrible teenage movie acting, the plot does hold up, and the pacing is actually fine. But if some of these other brain-dead reviewers can give this movie a glowing 9 star review, based purely on the fact that they like Megan Fox, I can give it 1 star based purely on the fact that I don't. I'm just self aware enough to admit it to myself.",Jennifer's Body
278,alishearer-69327,Mismarketed Fun Beyond Compare,9,14 May 2021,"I went into this movie, not knowing much.In the past couple of months, this horror-comedy has had a massive resurgence, obtaining a cult following despite its wide hatred when the movie was first released, back in 2009.One of the reasons many people weren't attracted to the movie and the result of its box office downfall, was due to its horrendous marketing. As you can tell from the poster, this movie was advertised entirely on Megan Fox, Megan Fox, and Megan Fox. Trailers for this movie were all over the place, some exclusively basing it on Megan herself, whereas others focused on the film as a terrifying horror. This movie is none of those things. It has got its horror elements of course, but this movie is very much about two girls and their toxic friendship deteriorating.I think this movie is incredible. Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried KILL in this movie. The two inhabited their roles in such fulfilling ways. Megan was in no way deserving of that Razzie nomination!!This movie was extremely ahead of its time. I don't want to get into too much, as this is a movie you should see without many details, but I highly recommend checking this out, for that reason alone.While there is a lot that there is to enjoy about this movie, something that may bother certain people, in particular, is its style of dialogue. I don't mind it too much but it could be something older audiences won't be too fond of.This movie does have its flaws, not the movie itself, but the way that the movie was marketed, with the objectifying posters and horrific Blu-Ray extra entitled 'Megan Fox is hot', displaying a montage of certain scenes shown in the movie. This doesn't affect the movie itself at all but if you know this information prior, it may be quite unsettling.Nonetheless, this movie is such a fun time, and there's nothing wrong with that at all. I've seen this around four times now, the first time leaving me with mixed opinions but after having time to think about the movie as a whole and watching it multiple times since then, it has evolved into one of my favourite horror/comedy movies yet.",Jennifer's Body

Cliche much? Humour and irony was subpar as well. It didn't live up to any expectations. What a waste of potential, Megan Fox and Amanda would've made a hot and iconic couple. Especially when megan's character ""goes both ways"". I'm disappointed they didn't have the courage to explore that storyline instead.

Though I did enjoy it, Juno was extremely overrated, and this piece of crap cements it for me. I hate Diablo Cody as a writer. Her contrivance and witty attempt at being hip and relevant just doesn't fly. I will give her credit for trying to look at dialog from left of center, but people don't talk like that....well except maybe Diablo Cody. But I didn't go to see a movie full of Diablo Cody's, I went to see a movie with moving characters you care for. If they die, I should care, which I didn't. and the ""twist"" ending made the Happening look like Citizen Cane, and I'm talking in this day and age where my future unborn children already know what rosebud is. It is still more of a reveal than this movie. It was a shame because there were same great actors in this movie and Megan Fox. Though I will give both Cody and Fox credit, because she actually fit the dialog well, but it doesn't make me hate it less. I found myself bored, and bored in a horror movie is unacceptable. I've seen some awful horror movies too, but never have I been this bored. I gave this movie 3 stars, one for Amanda Seifried, one for the (in my opinion) under appreciated Kyle Gallner, and one for the few interesting shots throughout the movie.

Turns out, this was actually pretty fun to watch. It's not a masterpiece, or even original, but I thought it delivered some pretty intense scares. It kind of had the feel Ginger Snaps had, which I think is a great thing.It wasn't meant to pick your brain or make you miss out on some sleep, but it's way better than some of the other horror films we've been seeing these last few years.So I give it a 7/10.

286,Al_K_Hall,Booze Revooze: Holding Something Against Jennifer's Body,7,24 October 2009,"You know how when you meet some really cool girl and you get along really well and you've known her for a couple years and you don't see her all that often but every time you do you remember what a blast you have with her. And then you find out she's got a big sister, who's really hot because your friend shows you a picture and your friend says she's gonna introduce you to the sister. So it's all good and you get pumped about the meeting but then when you're at the Bar None and you meet the older sister, you find out she's nowhere near as cool as the younger sister and you're disappointed because you thought there'd be some family resemblance not in looks but in the way they act but there just isn't, to the point it's harder to get drunk than usually because you're not having the fun you thought you would.It's kinda like that with ""Juno"" and ""Jennifer's Body"". Diablo Cody, the writer who stripped for a year before she decided to write ""Juno"", has presented us with this, her latest. But Jennifer leaves an aftertaste that Juno didn't.Here's what i like about ""Jennifer's Body"". The film was written by a woman (Diablo Cody), directed by a woman (Karyn Kusama) and stars two women. i like that it's a strong feminine movie, where the male and female roles are reversed for what i have baptized a 'Switch Flick'. Megan Fox (while maybe, at 23, a little old to play a high-school cheerleader) does a solid job as Jennifer and Amanda Seyfried makes the most of her portrayal as Jennifer's best friend; while, even more interestingly, the male parts of Jennifer's Body are tiny and insignificant. The chesty victims of traditional horror films are replaced by flat little boys and here the boy's meatier parts are held by women.The downside of the movie is that, as a satire of teenager slasher films, there is some humor but the basic framework is exactly the same as the movies it mocks. The director and writer should have taken the originality of their treatment of the characters and spread it into the story, the directing, the plot and all the rest of that stuff. As it is, Jennifer doesn't go as far as her little sister Juno.",Jennifer's Body
287,xmlrider,Underrated horror/comedy - could have been SO much more,6,18 April 2018,"Like so many ""modern"" horror movies, the creators of ""Jennifer's Body"" had a great idea, but didn't quite know how to execute it. Megan Fox was brilliant as a psychotic/smart-ass demon - the product of a botched sacrifice from a satanic rock band.A lot of possibilities, but in the end the writers committed the ultimate sin of storytelling: Always show, don't tell. In this case, they ""told"" instead of ""showing."" Lots of talk - but not enough action, right up to the final scene where ""Needy"" tells her ride that she's following a band,but ""tonight is their last show."" Great line. Great ending. But let's see her really $)@ these guys up... don't just show us pics of the aftermath...It was that way thru the entire movie.

I knew full well that this movie would be different than Juno, but I was hoping for some social statement about life in high school like their was in Juno. This movie did not have that statement, but that is not why I hated this movie. This movie was totally devoid of anything that makes a movie good. The acting was bad, the jokes were incredibly stupid, and the writing was among the worst I've ever witnessed. Those of you who want to watch this wretched movie for the fun horror aspect will find nothing. Even the people that just want to see Megan Fox naked will be sadly disappointed. The only thing that is keeping this movie from a 1 star review is the cool soundtrack. Diablo Cody, I know you can do far better than this rubbish.",Jennifer's Body

It's not meant to be taken seriously, obviously. It's an over the top formula high school terror comedy type movie. Just like the Faculty. It casts the hottest girl in showbiz right now as the lead character with supporting actors that look and act quirky and a little bit off. It's supposed to be cheesy and weird. It's not supposed to be deep and meaningful. And it comes through on those accounts. Just watch it and have fun. Don't try to watch it expecting an Oscar worthy performance from anyone. I think it's more like a cult classic type movie. One of those that not many people see in theaters but once people actually watch it, they enjoy it. That's all.

290,AllabtMovies,Pomising start .. disappointment followed throughout,5,26 November 2009,"Jennifer's Body, according to IMDb.com is Horror movie. Yet having watched it last night I do not quite remember if I even felt a single butterfly in my tummy. Megan Fox reveals herself as an actress who has the potential apart from a will-do-anything-for-that-body of hers, but, sadly the film's premise and most importantly lack of a tightly gripped script does not offer any room for character development. Jennifer's character does not show either a sad trait or a maligned happy one. Over and all, I didn't feel anything for her, nothing but apathy. I only wonder if director had persuaded her to get rid of clothes, that might have provoked some interest, at least for this gorgeous girl's fans, OK OK, I admit, myself too.As for the other protagonist (yes, was there any anta at all??), Amanda Seyfried, I do believe that she actually did some preparations. She played the role of a please-bully-me nice little girl convincingly but her sudden abrupt change into a monster by the end seems totally out of box, save the bite. She did get my attention as a psycho kick ass babe in the beginning, how I wish I could see more of that.It seems too early that an entire Hollywood venture be trusted on these ""broad"" shoulders. And now, I humbly beg not to be labelled a misogynist.As a whole, I seriously do not understand the vision of director Karyn Kusama, whether she was trying to present us with a horror movie or a so called horror movie crossover between High School Musical+Croc+Jason.Did I mention anything about Elizabeth Bathory? 5/10 (For sweet pie Jenny, of course when she's full).",Jennifer's Body
291,CoPSwords,Straight Up Comedy,6,3 October 2010,"After watching this movie, I am not entirely sure how I feel about it. I liked the comedic elements, but it seemed like everything else was lacking. Almost like they created a straight up comedy instead of a comedy-horror. For the most part, The movie does not take its self serious. However, There are about three parts that get painfully slow, because they expect the audience to care about the characters, after they spent the whole rest of the movie trying to destroy all sense of caring you may have for them. The entire ending sequence was painful, right up until the credits. The credit sequence was actually done really well. Really, everything from the climax afterwords felt like filler. Although the climax was the funniest scene in the movie. The dialogue was hilarious. It's really hard to describe, the made up words, the random word replacement, just kind of works for the feel of the movie. That being said, the dialogue does not fit at certain points, characters will point of the obvious, or comment on something completely unrelated. On top of that, almost no one reacts in a reasonable way. The only one who acts relatively realistically is Needy. The CGI was obvious, it was better than a lot of lower budget movies, but I felt it was really distracting. The only stunt that worked were the levitation scenes, but that was wires not CGI. At the end, I can't really decide whether or not I liked it. It was really funny, but it took itself too seriously, at certain points. It had broken dialogue, and too much CGI. Really, the negatives outweigh the positives, but it was amazingly hilarious.",Jennifer's Body
292,Graciegirl900,Not nearly as bad as reviews make it out to be,7,6 April 2010,"Well, it's not as good as Juno. But then it wasn't trying to be anything more than a fun, rompy comedy horror with some smart lines, friendship issues and female empowerment thrown in.And it wasn't bad. Admittedly it wasn't jump out of your seat scary, but it had a few decent ""moments"" in the first half, and there was enough witty dialogue to make up for it. Amanda Seyfried was on form as the geeky best friend who gradually emerges as a strong character, and Megan Fox wasn't bad either as the demonic cannibal cheerleader. Simmons was also likable as Seyfried's love interest.Yes, I thought certain parts were a bit silly (the lesbian kissing scene seemed more like a cheap soft porn stunt than a sensitive examination of the complications of female friendship)and at times I felt there should be a more obvious change in Jennifer after her possession.But I don't think this film was at all deserving of all the negative criticism it has received. The gore didn't feel overdone and there was a nice reversal of the gender roles usually seen in this genre.",Jennifer's Body

I won some passes, so I figured ""What the heck"".So, like the title says, it is a pretty cheesy movie, even more so then most PG-13 horror movies. However, it is pretty enjoyable, provided you like that sort of thing.Lots of one-liners. Lots of teenage jumble words, ""newspeak"", or whatever you want to call it... I was close to finding it annoying, but it was usually pretty funny.No Megan Fox frontal nudity, as far as I saw, there is a girl-girl scene, but it is pretty much just what you see in the trailer or commercials.The band, ""Low Shoulder"" are annoying. Really annoying. Then they exacerbate matters by playing their song throughout the movie at several parts. Ironically enough, I also won a copy of the soundtrack, which has that wretched song.

Having finally seen it, I enjoyed myself so much that I was left a little mystified that so many people seem to hate it.Let's be straight about this, Jennifer's Body isn't awards material, but neither is it trying to be. It's a deliberately cheesy and darkly comic movie that definitely harks back similar movies from the 80s. Some of the darkest parts of the movie had me stifling guilty giggles; that's good black comedy in my book.I thought the performance from the two leads was solid and enjoyable. Megan Fox played up Jennifer's sexiness, but gave her a subtle undercurrent of insecurity which gave tension to the character. Amanda Seyfried's Needy might not have been the cheerleader but was really the more settled and self-assured of the two characters.Friendships held since childhood can become somewhat ambiguous as people age. This movie captured that well. To me the kiss between Jennifer and Needy really showed the low-key battle that was constantly raging between them, one they weren't consciously aware of most of the time.Funniest scene for me involved some extremely shallow hipsters involved in some very dark dealings. Deliciously silly.So, in conclusion, give this movie a try. There's a strong chance that you'll have a very good time.",Jennifer's Body

Almost,8,28 September 2009,"Here's a movie that caught me by surprise, the trailers lead you to believe this is your usual, stereotypical, teen horror flick, with a sexy female lead, but this is so much more.At first some of the dialogue seems overly cheesy, as if its trying to sound like stuff a high school girl would say, and failing miserably. A couple horrible sayings into the movie (Wettie, shutties, and salty to name a few)I realized the movie was actually a comedy! And instead of being mad, thinking the writer thought teens say this shiz, I laughed realizing it was part of the subtle comedy of the movie.That being said, I had no idea this was written by the writer of Juno (Which I loved!). It also reminded me of Twilight the movie, its feel and use of great music, even the movie's band had some surprisingly great songs. Not to mention Adam Brody, who is the bad ass heart-throb, who fronts the band.So while Megan Fox is a definite stand out, I found the rest of the cast to be some what lacking, namely Needy. This movie really needed a strong girl for the role, and I felt Amanda Seyfried just didn't cut it. This is great date movie, with a lot going for it.

Jennifer's Body is not a braindead horror with a lot of nudity, but a clever, interesting and dark comedy for teens. As an angsty teen who loved mystique and lore I absolutely ADORED this very quotable movie. The characters are all really well written and interesting, the dialogue is funny and the movie has an almost satirical theme to it. There are definitely hints of the movie poking fun at horror clichés, Twilight and just general gender stereotypes in teen films.It's so powerful as a young girl to see a fun, sassy, evil female villain who isn't like a stepmother or just a mean girl. As a teenager it was just so satisfying having a horror movie with a good script, actually made for young girls.Watch it as you would black teen comedies like Heathers or Jawbreaker!",Jennifer's Body

Jennifer's first two victims are random, but the rest are people only Needy shows an interest in. Although this is a heightened situation, a lot of girls (including me) have experienced a close friend trying to destroy things you enjoy.A lot of the marketing is extremely sexual, so the negative reviews are people upset that it wasn't sexual.In a weird way, I found this movie kind of empowering. I relate strongly to Needy and so it's amazing to feel like someone typically shown as the best friend character get a voice and be strong.I really liked this movie and I recommend it to any female horror fans or anyone who just likes female centered stories with strong women. :)",Jennifer's Body

Jennifer's body costumes were possibly the most popular halloween costumes for teen girls this year. This movie has had a BIG revival on tiktok. Why? Because Jennifer's Body is a very interesting critique on women in horror and horror tropes as a whole. Not to mention the fact that y2k fashion has emerged again. Megan Fox's performance in this film is what pulls the whole movie together for me, her acting is superb in my opinion ( if it wasn't for the terrible early 2000s graphics, which i would discredits the actors in a way that is not at all their fault). I believe that a remake of this cult classic is much called for, because this film has the potential to be a subtle commentary on women in horror as well as teenagers today and increased social anxiety around social media.I think this film has become more relevant over time and would benefit from the improved graphics and layers of teen struggle, particularly for girls, which is at the forefront of people's minds today.",Jennifer's Body

The music was HORRIBLE! I mean what the hell! Hard metal music with screams zooming into a 'jock' who is fat and unnatractive. After a more or less sad scene they play a happy punk rock song.

Supposed to be a teen horror movie, but I thought it had the feel of a good ol' slasher with all the good ol clichés (the rock band, the pretty girls, the throwing up, the rituals,...), and an excellent second/third degree to it as well (funny references to our so-called social life, etc...). Entertaining, and yet if you want to dig a bit, you can find some depths to it (although it's no Kubrick or Fassbinder either!). Most critics didn't like it, and I believe it's simply because they didn't (wanna) get the second degree. And there is plenty of it, from the one armed-teacher to the stereotypical rock band , to the teen way of thinking, to the references to our sources of reliability and information (wikipedia, internet, Disney channel,...). It also didn't have the gross feel and the unnecessary graphic sado-masochistic violence that most remakes or horror movies have this days (saw,hills have eyes, Texas chainsaw,...), but rather that ""light"" feel that made the genre so interesting.",Jennifer's Body

The script had some good lines if you are in the right demographic to get the meaning, but the mono-mode acting detracted from the effect. Megan does one emotion quite well and that's about the extent of her range. You know the one I mean. Otherwise everything is just sort of thrown together with the desperate hope that enough frenzy would cover the bad parts. I was ""horrified"" by the movie, but it was more about what I spent than what I saw on the screen ...All the males who expected to see Megan naked have already been warned away from the movie, so no hope for them to buy tickets or DVDs of this. In the end, this will probably have the most success on cable TV, where people tune in to watch the good parts and skip everything else.",Jennifer's Body
305,samiam_leo,I need you hopeless....,9,19 September 2009,"Only reason I give it 9 instead of a 10 is because: the random fire that happened at the beginning. I mean seriously, what happened? Why did it start? Also, did the singer put some kind of spell on Jennifer to get her in the van? And, call me crazy, but I thought more boys should have died in this flick. Finally, where in the movie were some of the scenes in the trailer? Did they not make it past the cutting room floor? But on to the positives...I think the acting was awesome....both Fox and Seyfried give stellar performances. I loved the black goo-spewing scene, great scare factor. There were some good laugh out loud scenes and some scenes that made me jump. I loved the ending as well, kinda makes me wonder if (and hope for) a second helping is in store. I won't spoil that part. I would gladly go see it again. Funny thing though, there was an 80 year old woman sitting in the theater watching this movie as well!",Jennifer's Body
306,lyfzabytch,"Scary, Gruesome and Satisfying in the southern regions...",7,24 November 2009,"First of all, lets get one thing out of the way: JB is not a bad movie. Its a movie that will keep you glued to your seat for 100 minutes and make you flinch after every 15. The first 10 mins are beautifully shot not to mention the narration by the main character is pretty good too. The storyline is intriguing even though you decipher the final twist of the movie you are not 100% certain that you are right about it and most of you were not even though you won't admit it now. The horror scenes are extremely unnerving ((spoiler alert!)) especially the scene right after Jennifer's possession when she comes back to needy's home. The love scenes (rather lust scenes :)) depict the state of mind of teenagers very truthfully. Most people say ""that was just stupid"", ""why would he walk their?"" hormones is the answer. Boys would do anything for tail and thats what this film shows. You wouldn't go into a dark street for a pack of cigarettes but you would go running if a girl like Miss Fox is waiting on the other end (2nd Guy). The best thing about this movie is that it has a satisfying end when nowadays capitalist studios make some room for a sequel in the movie's climax when the villain rises again etc ( like ""Homecoming""). I am sure you won't be hearing about ""Jennifer's Body: The Black Diamond Curse"". The last scene when ((spoiler alert!)) Jennifer dies is extremely well shot and written (as in screenplay, the actual dialogs are OK). You will leave the theater content with the movie's end. Some problems are their that didn't let this movie turn into a great one. For example the dialog at some point is simply vague like Megan saying ""my tit"" at the end of the movie. They could have come up with a better deeper line in accordance with the scene. Also, even though a minor detail, the exchange student is shown as a Sikh whereas his name was ""Ahmed"" which is a Muslim name. A bit research would have taken this movie even more higher. Megan fox shows (unexpectedly for me) the depth of her acting as she makes you believe that she is a evil teenager. Amanda's acting is flawless as her role is affected less by the vague lines I mentioned earlier. I really liked the movie even though I heard bad things about it from friends. 100% recommended to any Miss Fox fan (& non-fan) and horror/suspense genre fanatics. Peace.

308,riju-debnath,Well I think this movie will hit the Cinemas...Let's Wait...!!!,8,9 September 2009,"Jennifer's Body is a 2009 dark comedy and horror film written by Diablo Cody. The film is directed by Karyn Kusama, and stars Megan Fox as the title character, Amanda Seyfried as her best friend Needy, and Adam Brody as the antagonist Nikolai. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the United States and Canada on September 18, 2009.Jennifer Check (Megan Fox) is the sexy, popular captain of the high school cheerleading squad. All of the girls want to be friends with her, and all of the boys want to have sex with her. Jennifer's friend since childhood, Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried), is a nerdy, substantially less popular, ""plain jane"" student. Jennifer ends up as the sacrifice in a Satanic ritual, held by a rock band, hoping that the sacrifice will increase their chances of getting a record deal. The ritual goes horribly wrong, causing Jennifer to get possessed by a demon and start feeding off of the boys in her high school—first seducing them to get close, and then consuming them in a manner similar to that of a Succubus. It becomes Needy's goal to stop Jennifer from killing more of her classmates.",Jennifer's Body

The use of invented vernacular, the juxtaposition of inappropriate conversations during the most supernatural scenes, the comedy/horror hybrid that perfectly matches the sarcasm and cynicism of the film... I loved it. Picture perfect. This movie was smart, young, fun, and it was what it was. It was the opposite of pretentious. Of COURSE Megan Fox plays the perfect vapid hottie, what else did anyone expect? She knows that YOU know this isn't an Oscar contender, so good on her for not trying to gussy it up. She is the absolute best actress for that character. I can't say enough good about this film. Go see it and enjoy it for what it is - ""new generation"" comedy (no slap-stick or fart jokes here) full of irony and hilarity and a groovy ""horror"" story underneath it all.Huge congratulations to Diablo Cody for continuing her amazing work as a writer who masterfully executes a script in SUCH a unique way that no one else can do.

310,ironmadonna,Force Yourself,8,3 August 2010,"First time I viewed the 2009 release 'Jennifer's Body' (20th Century Atomic Fox company) was July 2010 on a premium channel-I vowed I was done after one viewing. The intense violence, exploitation, theft and corruption of innocence was plenty after one viewing. Then I saw it 2 days later without the distraction of first time viewer shock gore, explicit content and realized the brilliance of it. It is truly written in the old adage of good vs evil with a very nasty, tasty, juicy twist on 'good'.. Karen Kusama cultivated each character perfectly to concoct a cauldron of hot steamy high school tragedy and pain. I'm a fool for Megan Fox, Fox is sexy teen box office cash, rapidly being pigeon holed and typecast-an Angelina hybrid.. Diablo Cody (Academy nominee ""Juno"" screenplay) is brilliant..sexuality, culture of a male dominated society and trade, she understands the cut throat nature of showbiz (any business) ie who wins/loses and @ what cost, there's a little penis envy and loathing of female oppression is evident. But through it all, she finds a way to make fun of it and laugh out loud, alberit darkly. All things to which some of us can relate. As it is with her-either love or hate the writing-there's no in between..My kind of girl- black and white with lines clear enough to know when they've been crossed-and ARE! I view Jennifer's Body at least once a day and discover something new and different each time. The soundtrack instrumentals, music and lyrics are apropo, profound and fun. The writing, directing, yeah even the dumb editing gaffes and bad lighting, reveal something new with each viewing. One misses a lot when one views the theatrical version only once or twice. The extended and unrated version is wholly more entertaining, sinister, dark, comical, sad, tragic, and stained through and through with the human condition. It gives me a wettie.",Jennifer's Body

It has the usual unrealistic dialog that tries to hard to be cool. It does successful remind us how truly cool the UrbanDictionary is, and that buzz words alone can't carry a film. If there is any label for this film, it would be comedy. Not because films have to be labeled, its because that's the only subtly-consistent trait you can find while watching it. The first scene is promising, you get potential sparks that it will go somewhere ... but it never does. Eventually you are going to the fridge and elsewhere on your own, saying, ""No, don't pause it"".

312,carlosgateleaper,Pretty darn good 80's-style teen horror flick! Diablo who?,7,29 October 2009,"I've been reading the comments here about this film and it seems like a lot of folks hate Diablo Cody and REALLY hate Megan Fox. For the record, I had no idea who Diablo Cody was before I saw this in a theater and when I was told she wrote the screenplay for Juno my reaction was ""Yeah...who cares?"". I never saw Juno and have no intention of seeing it. Doesn't look like my kind of movie anyway. Me? I like horror flicks which is why I made a point to see Jennifer's Body in the first place. Why would I be unnerved by some other screenplay Diablo Cody wrote for a film I could care less about. As for Megan Fox, I think had this film come out back in February of 2009 the box office would've been better. After having endured the ""Summer Of Megan Fox"", when her every move and utterance was breathlessly reported on and dissected on every blog and website, it was only natural that people would get sick of her and want to see her fail. This happens time and time again to young actresses. Build 'em up and then tear them down. Even her appearance on SNL to promote the film was ripped apart. It's interesting because she doesn't act any better or worse than she did several months ago, it just wasn't fashionable to try and destroy her at the time. This is a solid little teen horror film reminiscent of black comedy fare from the 80's. There are a few nice twists here and there (the career path the Indie rock band in the film chooses is hilarious) and the two female leads are certainly easy on the eyes. What prevents Jennifer's Body from being in the same league as it's 80's predecessors is that it wasn't exploitative enough! Frankly we could've used a little more Megan Fox in miniskirt, ruling the school and being the dreamgirl of every guy. I mean, if that's the whole premise of your film, wouldn't you have her looking as hot as she does in the film's poster? It seems like some of that material wound up in the trailer and not in the actual film itself (which is why I'm envisioning some sort of ""Unrated"" DVD release in the near future). With that said, Amanda Seyfried steals this movie and it's really a starring vehicle for her. The ending was a bit rushed and anti-climactic but I wasn't expecting Casablanca. As for the dialogue that seems to send some reviewers here into a frothing rage, it was no better or worse than any other teen Horror film I've seen this year. In fact, I've been hearing characters drop pop culture references in horror films since the early 90's so this is by no means an invention of Diablo Cody's. Why so many in the blogosphere are obsessed with this person I have no idea. Seems a bit silly to me. Relax. Check out Jennifer's Body when it comes out on DVD and have some gooey popcorn fun.",Jennifer's Body

This movie seemed to be sort of a female version of Fight Club. At least, it tried to be. I was getting the impression that the two girls might be the same person (Needy) whom Jennifer represents the ""hellish teenage girl"" conflict in Needy's coming-of-age, self-awareness, sexuality, and all that crap. Especially when her and Chip are in bed, and the fact that Jennifer disappears in various scenes. And I think the writer intended it to be a satire of all the vampire and indie bull out there. Anyway, even though it didn't make too much sense and its concepts could have been developed better, I found it disturbingly entertaining and couldn't stop thinking about it.As for the feminist argument, the movie in fact works very much against it...all the more reason why a woman needs a man!

314,chrissielioness,Jennifer's Body review,5,14 November 2011,"When I watched 'Jennifer's Body' I thought that it was OK, but nothing fantastic; one of the things that annoyed me about the film was the overflow of words like ""lesbigay""and ""freaktarded"". Then I watched the 1988 film, 'Heathers'and I noticed Jennifer's Body was similar with the storyline and characters. I thought this for a while until I saw 'Ginger Snaps' for the first time. The relationship between Needy (Amanda Seyfried) and Jennifer (Megan Fox)resembles the relationship, and how the storyline plays out, between the two Fitzgerald sisters in Ginger Snaps. So I feel that this man-eating cheerleader movie is a bit of a mix of these two films. I will say, however, that the storyline was a good idea. I think it would have been a lot better if the word play wasn't put on so thick from beginning to end. Also there was sometimes a blur between comedy and horror that didn't leave me laughing or jumpy. I think that Both Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried and good actors and they do give something to the film, but its not entirely enough.",Jennifer's Body

Never mind that I tend to avoid films that have horror, slasher or supernatural themes in them. In my opinion, Jennifer's Body isn't meant to be a serious thriller, which is pretty fine with me. It's more of a dark comedy than a real cult classic. I know a lot of people think that Megan Fox came across a little flat in some scenes but somehow, I think that's perfectly alright with the character she was trying to create. The small town popular girl who can be a bitch but who is also a little bit insecure and alone inside. And in the scenes that really count, I think everyone did a fantastic job. I especially loved the part where the character Jennifer was smearing make-up on her face. And the van flashback where the camera kinda zoomed in on the fear in her eyes. Needy's character, played by Amanda Seyfried, was great as well. I loved how she looked during prom. No, seriously.

The actors all tried their best with the material was give, but seeing as that material was Diablo Cody's they never stood a chance. If teenagers actually talked the way Cody believes they do, I would have killed myself in high school. There was very little characterization, every person in the film was a cardboard cut out of what everyone assumes high school kids are like. As a film student I give Kusama credit, there were a lot of shots she did that I liked, but sadly they felt useless in their placement. More of a ""ooooo it would be so cool to do this just because we can."" As a screen writing student, I feel this script would best serve as an example of bad screen writing.

There is no possession in this movie. There is no significance to the opening scenes whatsoever because they are never explained or touched upon again, most of the gore happens off camera and the lame girl on girl scene from the trailer is the only erotic aspect of the whole film, so if you think you're gonna see any nudity at all your mistaken. Even the awkward sex scene is ruined by bad dialogue and corny jokes.I've never hated a film as much as I hate ""Jennifer's Body"" the board will try to convince you that its ""hip"" and has ""memorable dialogue"" (memorable like herpes, it will irritate you for the rest of your life, disappearing when you forget it but then come back with a vengeance when you're reminded of it by some loser who quotes it thinking its funny) or that the film is some sort of deeper metaphor, but in reality is a terribly written, horribly edited film that was supposed to be released around Halloween, but was pushed ahead in an attempt to make its money back because the studio realized it couldn't contend with the rest of the horror flicks coming out near the end of this month.If you want to know what the experience of this film is like, take an issue of whatever teen pop magazine is popular nowadays (do they still publish tiger beat?) feed your dog some laxatives, have it squat on said magazine and beat yourself in the face with it for an hour and a half.Diablo Cody is nothing more than a human interest story with ego issues.

I'm a nineteen year old girl from the suburbs. Diablo Cody writes movies that resonates with people like me. The concept of the movie is, in my opinion, genius. A girl is sacrificed to the devil by a rock band in hopes that they can become famous. And may I say that Adam Brody pulled that role off splendidly. Only problem? Jennifer lied about being a virgin and now she's possessed by a demon, so whats a girl to do? Eat the living to stay alive, of course! The movie is funny. There's nothing really scary about 'Jennifer's Body'. I hate horror films, this isn't one. It's a farce, a play on teenage problems (my best friend uses me, my best friend wants my boyfriend), it has moments of comedy gold. Sadly... Megan Fox only pulls the rabbit out of the hat once or twice. She has moments of brilliance, but they quickly fade.That is pretty much the entirety of 'Jennifer's Body'. It has moments of brilliance. Some parts are just too funny, too smart, too clever that it makes up for where it lacks. The beginning of the movie, parts of the climax, how it sloppily comes to an end.

This film has no plot, no growth, no point and no redeeming qualities. It has be marketed very cleverly to hook in all the hormone driven teenage boys into thinking that Megan Fox is going to be this sex mad murderer who sleeps with, and subsequently murders the underdogs at school - what teenage boy struggling with his hormones could resist that!? Well anyone with an IQ greater then their shoe size! This film, if you can stretch the word that far, is pathetic. Megan Fox cements her reputation as being able to only pull off ""running"", ""sexy"" and ""vacant"" in her movies. Anything required beyond this and shes lost - you'd be as well served casting Stephen Hawking in a remake of the running man!

The death scene in the swimming pool - urgh! If it got any more clichéd, i would have died! Choked on my own disgust! This film has nothing that will interest you simply because it has no genre - it isn't a comedy......at all, although i laughed when i thought about the 100 minutes of my life i had wasted. It isn't a horror film unless you can count the acting as terrifying and it sure as hell fire isn't an action film! So what do we call it? I think in light of the fact that the world is in an economic meltdown and money is once again a precious commodity, wasting it on films such as this when it could be better spent elsewhere means this film now comes under the banner ""Pointless"" - it wont make money and if a sequel is made, we're all doomed because that means Satan has risen!

334,jadden,There is something here... but its not really a movie,4,10 February 2010,"With no offense intended for Karyn Kusama Jennifer's Body is simply the result of misdirection taken by the writer, director, and a few members of the cast.The story in itself makes for a decent dark comedy, The story set in a small town of nothingness rocked by several deaths caused by the human sacrifice conducted by a struggling Indie Pop/Rock band; See that as a concept is clever and has the potential for some humor, but this movie is suffocated by the attempt at reusing dialogue cut from Juno, and the endless poignancy that (we get it) Megan Fox is SEXY. The framing is all wrong, yes there are some humorous quotes, and some decent ill be it ripped of effects of stylized film making; but its the girl kiss or the kiss of death as it should be called in film making, an endless romp of teasing the teenage libido is the pre climax to this event. One can understand that Diablo Cody did not write this film with the intention of sneaking in another undeserved Oscar but, I would expect that her intentions would be to produce a solid picture not this pre-pubescent wet dream of a horror-comedy.",Jennifer's Body
335,darkmarshall1234,This Movie is Awesome!,9,28 November 2009,"Yeah! This movie is awesome. I don't know why some people are hating on it. It's really a great movie. Great horror movie, really scared me for some of the scenes. The plot is pretty interesting as well. There's a lot of drama and suspense and the movie is pretty unpredictable. The ending was a bit bad. That is something that they should work on. But most importantly, what I learned from this movie is that Megan Fox is hot! Awesome actress, awesome movie. You should go see it. The bad part about this movie is that it's not exactly the best movie out there and there is something about the plot that they should have worked on. But other than that, I think that this movie is great! Go Megan Fox! Woot!",Jennifer's Body
336,eddieglass,I love this movie,10,31 January 2010,"First of all let me say that I love this movie. Yes I used the word ""love"". I love the actors, I love the location, I love the look of the film, and I love Diablo Cody. I can understand all the people who don't like Diablo Cody's writing because she uses ""hip"" language and things like that, but that is in fact why I love it! For the film nerds out there, No, I did not go to film school. I like many different types of movies. I like all the same movies you like, and then probably a lot you don't. But the difference between you and me is that I can appreciate a movie for what it is.We can all agree that Jennifer's Body is not going to win the Oscar for best picture....SO WHAT!!! I love it anyway, and here is why.A script can only be so good on paper. It really does need great actors to take the film to the next level, and thats just what happened with this movie. Jennifer's body does start out with a good script. Yes that's right, I think Diablo Cody has a great and unique style of writing...ooooooooooooo, get over it. Amanda as the character Needy is fantastic. She is a great actress with a lot of talent. Megan Fox is almost too beautiful to be real, and that really helps the character of Jennifer stand out. She is improving as an actress and the movies she are in are meant to be taken as fun. Not some film like Citizen Kane. The character Chip is great along with the goth kid Colin. These two dudes play great awkward teenagers. The teacher played by J.K. Simmons was cool. The sex scene with Needy and Chip was (for the most part) unlike the typical ""Hollywood"" sex scene. It was real and funny. The movie has great direction from Karyn Kusama. And how about the make out scene with Needy and Jennifer?! that was crazy HOT. Low Shoulder were hilarious as the indie band that try to sacrifice Jennifer to the devil. Adam Brody was great and the fact that the band goes to such great lengths to get popular only shows how fake indie bands are anyway. They just want to be rich and famous like other rock stars. I don't know what else to say, I could go on forever. I hope Diablo Cody goes on to write more scripts and i hope they get made into great movies because she has a fan for life right here. Thats about it I guess. I love Jennifer's Body!!!!!!!!",Jennifer's Body
337,pieholened,An instant classic!,8,19 September 2009,"If John Hughes and Sam Raimi met in a back alley, and made a clandestine pact to create a teenage horror-comedy, it might have ended up feeling a little like ""Jennifer's Body"", a film that relies very little on gore and jump scares, but focuses more on the built-in horrors of living as a teenager attending a small-town high school.I haven't known many people who speak like Diablo Cody's characters (though, believe it or not, I have known one or two), but I find the dialog extremely entertaining on screen, especially in a film like this. Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox do a tremendous job here, and make the film very enjoyable, finding the perfect mix between fear, anger and wit. Unfortunately, there were many lines that left me in stitches, while everyone else in the theater looked at me like I was crazy (""You know what this is for? CUTTING BOXES!"").I know, I know...there's a backlash right now against Diablo Cody. In fact, there was a bit of backlash against her after ""Juno"" came out (a CLASSIC film, to be sure), and I just don't get it. She has a unique voice, which comes through very clearly in the screenplays that she writes. This voice is very different than most films, and I'm afraid that a lot of people just don't get it. However, for those who do get it, this movie is sure to be a classic on DVD; a movie that will be watched over and over because it is A lot of fun, it has heart, and it has good performances. Give it a chance. Then, give it another chance a couple of years from now. I think that this one will hold up over time.",Jennifer's Body
338,LuisRafaelDiazDeLaCruz,"Hell, Not!",3,11 April 2011,"Definitely I was totally disappointed with this film. The history of a schoolgirl having sex and killing her male schoolmates, even with gems Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried in the cast doesn't seems to be written by an Academy Award Winner(Diablo Cody).It's hard to stay watching the movie all the 100 minutes. In relief at least it has some nice songs, but when you notice how bad the history is, along with the weak performances and unremarkable characters that comes to nothing. Only recommended for Horror Fans and for those looking for some naked and/or lesbian scenes between Fox and Seyfried. Maybe if Fox gets totally naked, a movie like this would be worth watching. But until that: Hell, Not!",Jennifer's Body
339,Elmo8016,Everything I expected it to be.,7,20 September 2009,"Overall, this movie is exactly what I thought it'd be. Funny, entertaining, something that you would go to see with your friends on a boring night in town. Many say that it lacks depth, and that it can't really be classified as horror or comedy, and that's a bad thing. But all in all it's not really a movie that's meant to be taken seriously, such as Diablo Cody's prize, ""Juno"". The dialogue is witty, but not overly confusing. It's catchy, keeps your attention, and made me laugh plenty of times throughout the movie. The acting is iffy, but I wasn't exactly expecting an Oscar nod out of Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried. I know many people went into this movie expecting to see, well, Jennifer's (naked) body, and were incredibly disappointed. But for me, it was simply an enjoyable night at the movies. Well worth the $7 I paid for the ticket.",Jennifer's Body
340,Spenol,Stop hating Megan Fox.,9,1 October 2009,"I don't see what people don't like in this movie, really. It's a good, entertaining movie. Now, many people down-rate it because of Megan Fox. I see why people dislike her. She looks like a no-talent-all-looks actor, I thought so myself. But what people fail to see is that she is in fact a very good actor. Jennifer was probably a rather hard role to play, and she did it very good. And in these times were Hollywood trows crappy horror remakes and sequels at us like there's no tomorrow, this movie had a different plot. It's also successful when it comes to the horror. Creepy silences, musical build ups are used all over the film, not cheap cliché's, like person behind you in the mirror etc etc. If you're a horror-fan I definitely advice you to go see it. It's no Oscar-movie, and it doesn't try to be either, but it's a very entertaining and well made horror-movie:)",Jennifer's Body
341,xlipgloss-veins,"If you like demons and lesbians, you will like this movie.",5,15 September 2009,"However, if you don't care much for movies that appear to be in existence for the sole reason of giving pubescent boys one and a half hours of Megan Fox in various sexually referencing scenes, then give it a miss. I watched this film on a pre-release viewing, and I did not know what it was I was in for until I saw the films' title across the screen.'Jennifers Body' appears to be a dark comedy. There are humorous parts that are related to some sort for sexual innuendo or blatant sexual act (such as the charming description of Jennifer, played by Megan fox, who had to sit on a bag of frozen vegetables after losing her 'backdoor virginity.') But there are good suspenseful horror moments I must admit. There were a lot of screams from the girls in the theater, due mostly to what I call 'cheap scares', the typical ""I know someone is going to jump out now, I'm just waiting for it"" scare. Yet, the blood and gore was convincing, and I have to say that the scene where Jennifer appears in her best friends house covered in blood, giving a demonic blood filled smile and spewing out black goo WAS pretty good horror. As this scene was in the first 10-20 I thought we were in for a reasonably good movie. Meh. Not really.The acting wasn't bad. But you could tell that Megan Fox loved every second of being semi-naked or sexually flirtatious on screen. Her character was the 'hot chick' who could woo anyone with the flutter of her eyelashes. Yes, we all know she is attractive, but every second of this film was like ""HEY GUYS! LOOK AT MEGAN! ISN'T SHE HOT!"" It got old pretty quick. And Adam Brody was terrible. You'll see why.Yes, there were demons AND the mandatory lesbian scene with Megan Fox. Contrasting I know. But apparently, that's what the people want, so lets give it to them! A little insulting to say the least.To be honest, a pretty disappointing script from Diablo Cody, especially after Juno, which was witty and clever. Overall, 5/10. I would not pay money for a ticket and petrol to go watch it at the cinema, but probably would borrow it off a friend to watch if they hired it. Cheap thrills. Watch it if you want to tune out and not think for 90 minutes. Average, average, average.",Jennifer's Body

And i even cried at one part (not because it was scary, its because that part was sad). the acting is great, the cast is perfect for their parts and Megan fox does a great job as the evil sexy bad guy. i thought it was gonna be kind of cheesy but in the end it really wasn't! It has a twist too! and its original! a lot of movies these days have the same plot and nothing is surprising. but this movie is super original and I've never seen a movie like it.

I'm also not of big fan of slasher movies like a lot of recent horror movies (Hostel, etc). This is more like the old horror movies, but with a few jokes thrown in. I thought it was very entertaining. I watched the entire movie without getting bored. It went by quickly. And I liked the ending, although it could have been shown a little differently. If you see it, don't get up and leave the theater as soon as the credits start rolling, because there is a little more to see - until the real credits start rolling, you'll know when that is. I think it's deserving of 8 or 9 stars, but I'm giving it 10 to offset all the 1's it got. If you like classic horror, with teenagers involved like the original Carrie, you will like this. It's worth watching for the entertainment value it has. Very good compared to most movies I've seen lately, and I've seen a lot of movies lately.",Jennifer's Body

348,caldwellreid,Mmmmm...Disappointing.!,3,6 November 2009,"I decided on watching this film, not because every trailer for this movie has 'sexed' up the appearance of Megan Fox but for the brilliant writing of Diablo Cody (Juno). Where Juno was brilliantly scripted, character driven and meaningful, Jennifers Body was such a let down. The constant play on American hip-slang and Megan Fox's over seductive performance, this story was bad from the get-go. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Megan is a bad actress, she isn't. And her choice to star in this would have been down to the rep Diablo Cody got after Juno. Who wouldn't want to star in the writers next film. This movie was more like one of the hundreds of 'school slasher/horror' type films we have seen so many times. Please Miss Cody, get back to the heartfelt scripting we want from you. If you want to see this film for Megan Fox, then yes, she is a pretty face. But thats about all you'll be getting.

Shot in what looks like little more than 'Friday the 13th'-era lighting and stuttered speech that reeks of non-confidence, this is truly one of the worst movies I have seen in YEARS! Even Cloverfield was better than this piece of garbage. Also, IMO, this movie had a horribly uninspired title. ""Jennifers Body""? Get real DC. Juno wasn't great but at least it was kinda cutesy and left me with a warm fuzzy. This just left me annoyed and resentful of the money I wasted to go see it.

It was hard to deteremine if she improved or could do better in different roles. Most of scenes in these movie didn't amount to more then a few lines here and there, and looking hot. It would have been interesting if she played as needy instead of the demon. SHe did just enough to convince me she has some acting ability. I will be waiting for her break out movie from beautiful person, to amazing actress.Amanda Seyfried: She really surprise me on her acting, I have only seen here in ""Mean Girl"" in which she was an air head. But in this movie she really show me that she was a great actress. Seeing her go through all the emotional changes, and the ability she potray was very Nice. She definitely out perform megan fox in this movie, she was the main reason why I believe this movie is a must see. I will probably go see more movies from this actress in the future.

It was funny when it was suppose to be funny and hilarious when it was suppose to be serious. I never want to see another close-up of Megan Fox's man-toe-thumbs again. It made me quiver and was the only scary part in the entire movie. But I do have one huge question...What about the stupid hole in the beginning? They go out of the way to highlight this weird waterfall that empties into a mysterious hole and then don't use it as a plot point. It has nothing to do with the movie at all. In fact, it's a computer generated special effect (because the real Devil's Kettle looks completely different) aka a huge waste of money. Why would you put effort into creating something like that to mention it and then not make it important to the story line? Oh but it gets better...the pool where the next to last fight scene takes place just comes out of nowhere. There was no set-up or explanation of it.But lets back up a second and talk about the ritual. These stupid band members read an occult book and then try to sacrifice a virgin without saying any special spell (in fact they sing a very common song instead) and yet it still works.I hope this doesn't ruin Kyle Gallner's career...he deserves so much more.

The shoddy acting by other members of the cast and the predictable narrative structure made up a below average film.The Idea of the film was supposed to be a bit of light entertainment but i was slowly loosing interest in the plot and then it just end.Im glad i paid half price for the film because i was only half interested in it.",Jennifer's Body

Megan is sexy and display's it well. No need to criticize her for it. And really I don't care if she can act she looks great on screen.

It was not the typical teen horror film. The plot was very creative and original. I also enjoyed the mixture of comedy and horror. It made the movie more amusing.I also thought the acting in the film was excellent. Many reviews about this movie claim that Megan Fox is not a good actress, but I disagree, she played the role that she was supposed to. I do not see how she could have made her performance any better, her role was a snotty cheerleader who only cared about herself, and she played that role exactly. Amanda Seyfried also played her role well, she fit the description of her character and I saw no flaws in her performance.This movie was not the greatest movie of all time, but I don't think that was what the writer was aiming for. It was meant to be a fun movie that mixed horror and comedy. Obviously a movie that merges those two film genres should not be taken seriously, it was meant to make people laugh. I will admit that this movie is not one that would appeal to everyone especially because the humor appeals more to teens, but that is the case with most movies, everyone can not be pleased.For people who have not seen this movie, I would say see it for yourself because there are many mixed feelings about this film and it is all about opinion.

Im quite convinced that the only reason anybody would even remotely want to watch this movie is for the mere pleasure of Megan Fox's supposed Bad Girl rep., that or being fooled into thinking they're going to see a note-worthy horror flick. Sure she had some good shots but she's not the greatest actress ever as people claim her to be!! This Movie did have potential to an extent but it's lack of direction and talent were set-backs. The movie plot and storyline were simply treacherous!! I realize it's not a true story and a lot is left for interpretation but even by the ending I still couldn't figure out what she was possessed by and where it even came from. Even More so why Needy, Jennifer's friend, stayed as long as she did in the looney Bin when she had these ""demon-powers"" of hers at hand and could escape at any time. I know if I were in her position I wouldn't have spent a single night in a place like that. I may add again that I just don't see what the big uproar is about Megan Fox...if she's going to even be in a movie, her best bet is one without any dialogue whatsoever!! That way everyone is happy!!

I knew it had done poorly at the box office so I came to IMDb to read some reviews. What is everyone smoking? This movie rocked -- in every way that it should have rocked and no more. It was funny, sexy, corny, sometimes spooky with a little bit of jumpy, and overall totally worth a watch. In fact, I'm going to go buy it on DVD to add to my collection. This is dark comedy with a horror/gore premise. It's Megan Fox's best role yet (I realize that's not hard to hit) but honestly she did a great job. And I love Amanda Seyfried. The casting was perfect and it was exactly what the creators intended. I say rate a movie on how much you enjoy it but also on what it's supposed to be.Haters: get over your snooty, BSing, smart-ass selves. It isn't supposed to be award winning, it isn't supposed to have any meaning, and it isn't supposed to be in any form or way compared to Juno or anything else. Half of you are probably struggling to see your own screenplay make it and are just steamed that Diablo Cody got an Oscar. Juno was dead good freakin' awesome for a number of reasons, and no one knows who from the creative team is going to get an Oscar. Diablo told the story first and won the raffle on awards night. She deserved it. You all give up the whining and go work on your own stuff.Real people who want to enjoy a great ride and a very entertaining film -- come on in! Jennifer's Body is better than half of all movies, doesn't pretend that it's as good as the other half, and isn't meant to be compared anyway. It's fun and fast moving, bloody, dark, quirky, kooky, sexy (Megan AND Amanda!), pithy in dialogue, and basically just a good show. It's everything a normal person would expect it to be.This probably isn't really worth a 10 – on my scale it's probably more like a good 8 (all movies considered it's in the middle but I enjoyed it at a 10 for what it was supposed to be).

I laughed so hard in parts it hurt, not sure if this was intended but still.""Jennifers Body"" is that one you'll pull out on a dead-end weekend, It is so easy to watch!

There is a bitter-sweet friendship at the core of this movie and that's the thing that'll get you to pull it off the shelf.",Jennifer's Body
361,DemocraticAnarchy,"Some Dark Comedy Slash Films Aren't For Everyone, but it was Good Enough for Me",7,26 September 2010,"So here's where I'm at: I dislike Megan Fox. Maybe that's just from the way she looks. Maybe she's different in person, but I'll never know. So I'm just content to watch a movie that has Megan Fox cast as the evil, demon-possessed, flesh eating, teenage bitch. It's the perfect part for her. Or at least it seems that way to me and my friends who all share the same views on her. The director, Karyn Kusama, the producer/writer, Diablo Cody, and Heike Brandstatter/Mindy Marin/Coreen Mayrs were brilliant to cast Megan for this part because I'm sure that at least 85% of the people who know who Megan Fox is, feel the same way I do. Diablo Cody, who wrote Juno, an indie teen flick filled with quips and humor, wrote this movie and you can expect some of Juno to rub off here. And that's what Jennifer's body is. It's delightfully gory, but not scary, and filled with the same Juno-like humor that I fell in love with. It's not for everyone, and it's definitely a dark comedy. But who cares? It's the perfect part for Amanda Seyfried as well, as I think of her almost exactly like her character Needy. Except less ""Kicky"" of course, but you'd have to see the movie to understand that. And less swearing. But people never fail to surprise. Anyway, the relationship between Amanda's character Needy (her real name's Anita) and Jennifer is almost exactly as real as two friends that have literally been friends for 90% of their life can be. They have really nothing in common. Needy is down-to-earth, while Jennifer is...well a stupid bitch. I mean who gets in a creepy van with like 6 creepy indie rock players? Whatever. The chemistry between them is apparent, despite their lack of familiar interests, and the movie is rife with lesbian-like feelings. But only feelings and awkwardness except until that like two minute scene in Needy's bedroom. But I won't spoil anything there. As someone who has had a life-long friend like Jennifer, I can honestly say without shame that some 'feelings' I guess have surfaced. I'm not gay, but it's just one of those awkward phases in a life-long friendship. As the director Karyn Kusama said (I'm paraphrasing) ""If the one of the friends was a guy and one was girl the whole feeling and kissing stuff would be fine. But if it's two girls it's socially unacceptable."" I'm not sure if that's exactly what she said, but it doesn't really matter. You get the point. A simple handhold, a look from Needy, and well, let me just say that the character's are deep enough for this kind of film. The music is wonderful, if you like indie/alternative/rock. Conclusion: The movie is good and enjoyable. Not great, as you will find out by various inconsistencies in the plot, but it's enjoyable if you like dark comedy horror (it's not really scary, it's just kind of revolting at some points). Just watch the movie and decide for yourself.",Jennifer's Body

Weren't it so, I wouldn't have care about the dialog which oscillate between the level of a gonzo porn movie and some much better high level (self-irony, etc.), neither would I have cared about the predictable scenario probably based on ""Species"" from Roger Donaldson. I would have enjoy the the suspense, the dialogs, and the sensuality, and so on. Sadly, ""now I'm old and bored"" (Nirvana - MY teenage time!).

Everything is bad. The dialog is extremely awkward and comes off way too contrived. The special FX look like they were created a decade ago. It's not even funny or scary. The movie itself is a complete joke. I honestly have no idea how this ever got green-lighted. Wow. I am amazed that money was actually spent on producing this piece of garbage.

And while I want to inspire potential viewers by saying 'actually, we were totally wrong, it was fabulous!' I'm actually going to have to say we were completely right. I mean, really....it's one of those horrors that is MADE for teenagers to make out in the back seats of the cinema over, for want of a better description. It's even got the cheerleader thing going on, bringing it ever closer to home for them.

If you like horrors that give you something other than the standard mind numb, opt out.I have to say, had I not had a 10 line minimum limit, my review would have simply been this;Who's watching the film!?

It was what I expected a run of the mill teen horror movie with a predictable plot although I do commend it for following an actual plot line which many movies like this one fail to do. The acting wasn't bad, though sometimes it felt over- acted in the more ""intense"" scenes which drew away from the scariness. The kissing scene between Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried was totally unnecessary and random in my opinion but I guess it was there to draw in a male audience which I am not a part of.

367,zamanological,I'll give it a fifty-fifty chance,5,4 December 2011,"Normally everything around us gets a fifty-fifty chance but in case of movies, we have ratings on sites like IMDb. So when you watch a movie, you should either have a positive opinion about it or a negative one. it should be that clear. when I watched this movie, I felt pity for those who were expecting something quite extraordinary or at least scary. I mean yes, if you are alone at home and it's dark outside, then maybe you'd wanna wait till you get back our courage before going to the bathroom. However, the comedy/horror genre does not suit it as much as the other contenders in this category.Having two lead female characters is a challenge in itself already. And when they are some of the most sensual ones or at least known for doing sensual roles, then it become quite hard for the director to pull things off properly. The attraction must be there because the girls are attractive. But you can not make them too attractive as it would spoil the movie. That is where the fifty-fifty comes in. It was almost a balance of beauty, sex appeal and acting for Megan Fox. Though in some scenes it would serve the movie well if both of them (Megan and Amanda) were acting correctly. They could not deliver the horror flavor in some crucial scenes where it was needed the most. I have no idea how much editing was done but some scenes were unnecessary while I was expecting some other scenes to explain things more accurately. The acting of some of the supporting casts were not helpful at all. They could have done better.That being said, I want to mention that I gave it 5 out of 5 only because despite the faulty acting, somehow the movie worked pretty well. I have seen other movies that were totally horrible. I mean we all have seen movies that received a lot of hype but totally failed in living up to all that. Constantine, The Mist, Cloverfield, Apollo 18, The Guard, Splice etc were all kind of like that to me. They promised a lot in the trailers and Storyline written here on IMDb but they failed to deliver it correctly. This one on the other hand did not do such a bad job. I'm pretty sure most people watched it because of the cast. The name and the cast of the movie gave quite a hint to the kind of sensual entertainment one can expect. It did that, quite nicely.",Jennifer's Body

Kat Dennings could make a cameo, I mean her face has some similarities to Amanda's and her body is a LOT better than Amanda's.

First of all, the writing was similar to Juno in that it kind of annoyed me because of how unrealistic it is. But this film was satirical, and in that, the writing totally worked for it. It made fun of itself, and a lot of the dialogue was HILARIOUS so it's not a problem. Megan Fox was perfect for the role, and Amanda Seyfried also did an amazing job. I loved the direction and cinematography, and the use of music was also very impressive. It's brave, smart, and deliciously genre-bending. The only thing I critique I have is the lesbian element. I felt that it was really unnecessary for the storyline, and it felt really gimmicky to me. The opening/closing in the psych ward was absolute brilliance. Best part: ""I'm a kicker"" and the subsequent kicking of an orderly. Amazing. Especially when you learn about Seyfried's character and think back on it.",Jennifer's Body

Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried deliver their best performance ever in this film and their cast mates delivered a solid performance as well. The script was gory enough to keep horror fans happy but not so gory so that non Horror fans wouldn't be able to sleep. The dialogue between Megan and Amanda was hilarious and they gelled very well together. If I have to fault the film it has to be that my mother walked in just as Amanda was making out with Megan and it created an awkward conversation that I wouldn't like to repeat, so I don't recommend this film for a family night in.

It used wiccan symbolism such as the tattoo of the moon on the band members, and the pentagram on the book of witchcraft. Those symbols stand for peace and nature. Not human sacrifice. Wicca and witchcraft has nothing to do with curses or demons. One number one rule is do not harm anyone. Human or animal. Witchcraft is just a prayer that involves incents salt and water to represent the unity of the elements. In Wicca there is no devil. just the fact of karma and what u do to others will come back and be 3 times worse. No true wiccan would risk that for a human sacrifice that isn't even related to the religion.

The movie starts with ""Needy"" in an institution {I wonder why?} and you see some scars {I wonder where they're from?}. Btw, these questions are answered if you watch the movie. The movie goes on to establish just HOW close these 2 girls are, and once you establish that they might be the same person, it's very interesting to watch. It explains a lot of things in the film such as Needy going to the door and no one being there, and suddenly Jennifer is inside.

But I watched it because SHE was in it and I thought - ""Hey, it can't be that bad, I just wanna see HER."" MAN was I wrong. Not only can she not act (I should have been able to see this in Transformers but I was so over-whelmed by the actual transforming metal...I digress) all she does is prance around with her stomach out the whole movie.The ""lesbian scene"" was over-rated. People need to lighten up. It was NOTHING EVEN WORTH MENTIONING. It doesn't even justify a rental price. It's two girls kissing. You can see that at a park.The ""cute"" dialogue just aggravated me - a building burns down and she says the town has a ""tragedy boner"". Seriously? What kind of line is that really? Take a look at the ""memorable quotes page"" and you'll see more witty banter similar to this. I was actually kind of glad to see that it was a ""horror movie"" but then, even though there were a few creepy scenes, this movie felt just like ever other horror movie made in the last decade. Full of witty banter and nothing really scary. Which I was bummed about because it's hard to find a good scary movie anymore...Megan was eye candy - and nothing more. Of COURSE guys are going to do whatever she wants them to - evil or not, women have that power over men normally. I say reverse the roles, make Megan the ""brainy hero"" and have the other chick the demon. Nobody would see that coming...Even the soundtrack was full of ""angry music"".Could they have done better? I think not. The plot has been outlined in other comments but a punk rock band tries to sacrifice a virgin and turns out she's not, so she becomes a demon. Then eats guys. That's it.If you are a pre-pubescent boy looking for some steamy on-screen fun: steer clear of this one. It's disappointing.

I have to say when Amanda Seyfried said she regretted doing one movie in her entire career, this one came the first to mind but only because I know of how unfairly hated it is, Amanda and Megan should be proud of this movie in my opinion, it gave Megan one of her most iconic roles (if this isn't it) and Amanda probably just because she got to make out with Megan Fox. I can't explain how much I don't get the hate for this amazing movie.",Jennifer's Body
376,Bradster73,A comparison....,7,1 January 2010,"OK...this may not be Shakespeare, but in the days of not needed remakes and complete un-originality, this is not at all a bad horror movie. Not only do you have a decent story, but you get Amanda Seyfried as the cute heroine and the sexy (yes I said it...ugh)Megan Fox as the cheerleader demon that has a thing for cannibalism. The special effects are above par, the acting is effective and you actually feel for our heroine as she turns from the geek to a box knife wielding avenger.Although this movie did not do well at the theaters, I beg anybody who enjoys horror to seek this one out and take a peek. Diablo Cody's writing was much more realistic here then in the previous Juno. I think she probably likes scary movies and it shows here.You also have several supporting characters that sort of just show up here and there. Not only do you get a diabolical yet funny Adam Brody, but also J.K. Simmons, Amy Sedaris and Cynthia Stevenson.I will admit I went into this one not expecting what I ended up with and I am glad. I actually liked it much more than Paranormal Activity..which yes creeped me out, but definitely did not entertain me like Jennifer's Body. This is a solid film and I am sure will become a minor cult classic in time. Even if you dislike Megan Fox (me), see if for the adorable Amanda Seyfried. By the way I also laughed out loud a few times during the banter between our two leads.RECOMMENDED!!!!",Jennifer's Body
377,happynoodleajay,A solid horror/comedy,9,22 September 2009,"I went to see this, honestly not expecting that much, based on some of the reviews I saw on here. I was pleasantly surprised by this horror comedy however. As a guy who not only thinks Megan Fox is a bad actress, but is also NOT the hottest thing on the planet, I was hesitant to see it, but I liked Juno and my fiancée and I decided to give it a shot. I think the people who hated it were guys who went to an R-rated horror film that was CLEARLY marketed by MEGAN FOX'S body, expecting to see her nude. Sorry, but no nudity. There is a make-out scene between Fox and Amanda Seyfried (who is actually the star), but I think people fail to see that it's in there for the sole purpose of satirizing itself. The whole movie is a lot deeper than what's on the surface...it's about friendship and bodily changes during high school...it's really a horror film by women, about women, for women. Not that men can't or won't enjoy it...I loved it...it's just dealing with things more from a woman's perspective it seems. And Megan Fox wasn't even that bad in it. Seyfried stole the show though, she was excellent. Adam Brody's side character was great as well.

379,redcat23,First draft of an 8th grade creative writing assignment?,1,17 August 2010,"The plot in a nutshell is: Indie bar band Low Shoulder seeks supposed virgin Jennifer for sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Only their sacrificial virgin is anything but! Best friend Needy discovers that the sacrifice of a non-virgin results in a soul hungry demon.I've seen a lot of horror movies in my time. From Alien Dead to Zombie Holocaust. I can accept people being evil for many reasons. However a botched sacrifice to Satan just seems silly to me.It starts with Jennifer and Needy at a dive bar watching a band. Needy overhears the band talking about Jennifer and the possibility that she's a virgin. Needy confronts the band and for some reason tells them that Jennifer is a virgin when it's assumed by Needy that the band is looking for a virgin (presumably for sex). Jennifer reconvenes with Needy and the band starts their song. Jennifer is shown awake, alert and never taking a drug or even drinking a beer. During the song she gets lethargic and glassy eyed. At this point a fire starts. However no one notices it. Jennifer continues to sway as if she is in a trance. The fire gets bigger. Jennifer is now completely entranced. Finally a flaming support beam falls on some customers tables. At this point people are spontaneously combusting. The slow motion scenes of people burning paints a picture of something more sinister then a simple electrical fire.The way everything is shot, timed and framed, one would think that Jennifer was inadvertently the cause. Perhaps this would be the first big manifestation of her evil powers and with some flashback scenes Needy would see that her best friend has always had an inadvertent evilness about her. If this were the case and now Needy has to unravel a mystery about how her best friend has a kind of Damien/Carrie thing going on, that could be good. However that is not the case.Needy pulls Jennifer out of the burning bar. Flaming people are seen running to and fro, flinging themselves out of windows and onto the ground. It's as if the bar was built of kerosene soaked lumber. Low Shoulder shows up outside looking suave and cool while drinking their drinks. They offer to give Jennifer and Needy a ride. However Needy knows that they have an ulterior motive (presumably sex) and tries to convince Jennifer of it. Jennifer is still in a trance and as if hypnotized says that she wants to go with the band. With very little protest from Needy (""Jennifer no. Come on. Let's go""), Jennifer leaves in the Low Shoulder band (bang?) bus.At the end of the movie a demon possessed Jennifer reveals to Needy what happened in the van. She starts off ""That night at the bar, I was pretty f----d up and went with the band"". But as I said before we never see her take anything that would f--k her up. In fact the one drink she does order, she sets down to groove to Low Shoulder. Perhaps Writer/Director Diablo Cody had intended the line to mean that she was in shock. If that were the case a better line would have been, ""After that fire I was so scared I didn't know what I was doing so I want with the band"". ""I was pretty f----d up"" generally means too much drinking or too much drugging.Then there is the issue of how everything is timed. Again, this is all revealed by Jennifer at the end of the movie to tie everything together. Jennifer leaves with Low Shoulder in the van. Needy goes home. Low Shoulder takes Jennifer to a mountain cliff that overlooks the Devil's Kettle whirlpool (""scientists keep throwing all kinds of stuff in the hole but they never find it"") and tie her down. The lead singer quickly tells the band members why they are there (too sacrifice a virgin to Satan so they can become big time rock and rollers). The bass player has second thoughts so the band has to convince him that being a second rate indie band isn't as cool as a mega rock band that had to sacrifice a virgin to Satan. Reluctantly the bass player agrees. They sing Tommy Tutone's ""Jennifer"" and then sacrifice her. The lead singer throws the knife into the mysterious whirlpool. Meanwhile, Needy gets home and calls her boyfriend (not the police to report the supposed rapist band). Then Jennifer has awoken from her murder, untied herself and is now wandering the streets. She makes her way to Needy's house and bangs on the door. Needy, still on the phone with her boyfriend, checks the front door. No one is there. Though somehow a shadowy figure is lurking behind Needy in the house. Needy's boyfriend offers to come over. But Needy says no. After seeing people engulfed in flames, witnessing her best friends abduction by the supposed rapist band and now someone banging on her door of course she wants to be alone. After she gets off the phone a bloody Jennifer jumps out at Needy, barfs up black stuff and then runs out of Needy's house. That's a lot happening in a little bit of time.In the end Needy has murdered the demon Jennifer and has been put into a mental institute which she escapes from. While she's walking near a drainage ditch she finds the knife that killed Jennifer (apparently this is where the whirlpool goes). Scientists couldn't find this drainage ditch but Needy inadvertently stumbles upon it months after the sacrifice.Even though Low Shoulder botches the sacrifice, they still got the fame and fortune they were after. It was win-win for them. I mean, they did end up getting their comeuppance, just not from Satan and not until they made lots of money, did lots of blow and enjoyed the rock star lifestyle.",Jennifer's Body

Now, knowing more about queer and feminine roles in traditional horror I am blown away by the role reversal, the self awareness and the cleverness of the film. I watched it recently and was amazed with the witty writing, the funny acting and great soundtrack. Megan Fox deserves so much more recognition for this film than the Transformer series (which disrespected her on screen and behind the scenes); she is funny, sexy and powerful in every scene. Amanda Seyfried sells Needy's conflicted character throughout the film.
The queer text in the film is so beautiful and reflects a lot of Western Gothic tropes like female empowerment, repressed sexuality, grotesque beauty, and the desire to become someone else.

Nor will it become the vehicle to finally turn Megan Fox from a butter face vamp to an A-list supernova. Jennifer's Body is about a teenage girl - played by Fox - who is used as a virginal sacrifice for a Satan worshiping band - lead by The O.C.'s Adam Brody. Exceptthings go ape when its revealed that not only is Jennifer not a virgin, but she's also not a 'backdoor virgin' - that line made me laugh - which results in her body being taken over by a demon who then terrorizes and eats teenage boys to survive.Jennifer's best friend ""Needy"" - perfectly played by Amanda Seyfried, who you may know Mean Girls, Mamma Mia!, or the Avatar toppling Dear John - decides that Jennifer needs to be stopped and makes it her mission after J sets her sights on her boyfriend.The movie works on a few levels: 1) as a pop culture filled comedy, with a million quotable lines 2) as a rainy day DVD pick or background noise as you fold laundry. However it fails as a horror film. Meaning the requisite moments, like the ""lets turn around slowly and have the person who obviously wasn't there a second ago pop up"" scenes, as well as the ""lets not believe the one person who seems to know what's actually going on until its too late"" scenes make an appearance, but not in a self parodying way.Seyfried & Brody - and an out of place, but hilarious, JK Simmons - lift the film from the dirt, as does Diablo Cody's writing, while Fox basically just stands there & looks ""pretty""which is sad, since the plot & marketing revolve so heavily around her character.

This isn't really a spoiler but I will mark it as so just in case so I can talk more specifically.Is that really how they talk now-a-days? OK so back to the movie and rather my mid mid life crisis. Outside of the common chatter it had quite of few decent horror movie aspects. It had beautiful gals portraying many of different types of roles, a bit dimwitted but considered gullible and horny guys to be easily lured.... ah... the good old days of high school hehehe. I can't say much bad out of this movie outside of the high school chatter. Une belle fille covered in blood kind of makes a movie ten times better depending... but i'm a sucker for biters hah. *ahem* anyhow again not staying on topic so i will end this comment. 8/10 - good story line - good acting - a couple of life's awkward funny jokes - .... so I will one day own this not just to add to my horror collection but to watch for my own amusement.",Jennifer's Body
