0,Prismark10,Hubie Halloween,6,21 October 2020,"Adam Sandler continues with his Netflix comedies which always gave me the impression of sloppy seconds.In Hubie Halloween. Hubie Dubois (Adam Sandler) is the town's doofus with the goofy voice but a sweet nature.Halloween is coming to Salem, Massachusetts. There is an escaped patient from a mental institution and some of Hubie's long time tormentors have gone missing.Hubie is suspicious of his weird new neighbour Walter (Steve Buscemi.) He drools over his dream woman Violet and reports every suspicious activity to police officer Steve Downey (Kevin James) who used to be married to Violet.There is an all star cast but some like Ben Stiller only appear for a short scene. Hubie Halloween is better than Sandler's other Netflix comedies.The voice is annoying and my wife had enough of it rather quickly.As I said before, Sandler knows his audience, he is very popular with various ethnic groups and religions. He delivers what they want regarding the comedy and this film has more diverse casting.",Hubie Halloween
1,mark.waltz,"More smiles than laughs, but at least I smiled.",5,6 October 2021,"You can't expect anything but silliness from an Adam Sandler comedy, and this artsy looking Halloween comedy does give me some laughs through bad taste and some of the most ridiculous aspects of society that really need to be laughed at more often. Sandler is Hubert Dubois, a deli clerk in Salem Massachusetts who is Salem's unofficial Halloween safety monitor. He's also not very well liked, and there are many reasons for that other than his distinct voice which I have actually heard on people in life. He has a tendency to be a bit too blunt, telling people things in public that they don't want others to hear, and that results in Sandler pelted by the local teens with food and other disgusting objects. He's also a very dim bulb, getting into situations that others would avoid, mainly because he has absolutely no common sense whatsoever.So while there's not really a strong story, you do get encounters with one of the odd neighbors including Steve Buscemi who thinks he's a werewolf, Rob Schneider as an escaped mental patient, Ray Liotta as the rudest man in town and Ben Stiller as the vicious mental institution orderly. Veteran character actress June Squibb is also memorable as Sandler's mother who made love her son but I can't help but express his weaknesses in public.The film is overloaded with Halloween style props, much of it garish and a humorous slam at holiday obsessed communities that tend to overdress their town with decorations. I also love the polite little knock at news channels who focus on looks over quality, hiring dim but buxom females over experienced journalists. At least Sandler's strange voice pattern never changes, and as annoying as it may be at times, it's in line with all of the other voices I've heard him utilize. The main problem for me is that this film has far too many characters, so it becomes difficult remembering who is who especially since they don't appear consistently, only intermittently. Other than that, I had a good time watching this, chuckling more and more as the film went on.",Hubie Halloween

4,kosmasp,Defying the odds,4,26 October 2020,"There are many odd things, when it comes to Adam Sandler and his movies. He has a fan base that will love and cherish the silly outputs no matter what. This being one of them. And that is ok and fair. But reading from another reviewer that he is happy, that a Halloween (themed) movie is not scary is just strange to say the least. It's like having a comedy that isn't funny .. oh wait I get it now! Of course it is - makes sense now.All kidding aside (or wherever it is hidden), this is about personal taste. If you like Sandler pretending to be mentally challenged (as I reckon the political correct way to say is now - he himself wouldn't call it that, but make a crude and ""fun"" remark), but also witty enough when he has to be ... you will be entertained by this. Lowest common denominator can be enough. I wish I could just sit back and enjoy this, as others do, but I just can't. It's way too ridiculous and it's way too convenient.So no matter what I write, your mind is made up. I just hope for you that you can enjoy it",Hubie Halloween
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"If you have reasonable expectations, you may just like it.",6,9 October 2020,"Hubie Dubois is mocked by all around him, a man with a good heart, and an overbearing Mother.I like the spirit of this movie, it's good, old fashioned slapstick humour. If you come here expecting sharp witty humour, you're in the wring place, this is Adam Sandler, you know full well what you're getting.You will laugh at some of the gags and jokes, the funeral scene was very funny.What's less funny is the voice, it didn't work for me, at times I couldn't understand a word he was saying, some of his expressions were agonising to watch.It looks so nice, Americans know how to celebrate Halloween in style, the visuals are cracking.Some of the reviews I've read criticise the humour, once again I wouldn say, it's Adam Sandler, you know only too well what the humour is.A nice family watch, 6/10.",Hubie Halloween
6,jboothmillard,Hubie Halloween,2,4 March 2021,"I initially saw the images of this film when it was released on Netflix, I had a feeling it was going to rubbish, so it was no surprise when I received a message from the Razzies, for which I am an official member for voting, that it was suggested to be nominated awards, directed by Steven Brill (Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, Without a Paddle). Basically, Hubie Dubois (Razzie nominated Adam Sandler) is a delicatessen employee in Salem, Massachusetts who is ridiculed by almost the entire city. He is the butt of many practical jokes, often has things thrown at him whilst he rides his bicycle, and his antics often annoy police Sergeant Steve Downey (Kevin James) and Father Dave (The Shield's Michael Chiklis). The only person who is kind towards him is Violet Valentine (Julie Bowen), who he may be attracted to, and vice versa. During the Halloween holiday, Hubie spends his time monitoring the city as the official Halloween Helper. The day before Halloween, Hubie meets his strange new neighbour Walter Lambert (Steve Buscemi). News spreads around town about Richie Hartman, a convict who has escaped from a local mental institution. On Halloween, Hubie investigates Walter's home after reports of strange noises. Hubie reports to the police, and Sergeant Downey ""recruits"" him as an ""AUU"" (auxiliary undercover unit). Hubie believes this assignment is genuine, but Steve hopes it will stop Hubie from bothering him. Hubie goes to a local Halloween party to monitor the activities. Hubie is tricked into going into a corn maze following reports about a lost child. Hubie's teenage co-worker Mike Mundi (Karan Brar) follows in the hope of scaring Hubie. Hubie finds Mike and sees him getting pulled into the maze and then disappearing. Hubie moves on to monitoring at a drive-in cinema. Hubie's old classmates Lester (Tim Meadows) and Mary Hennessey (Maya Rudolph) scare Hubie after false reports of suspicious activity in one of the cars at the drive-in, but Hubie ends up having eggs thrown at him. He flees into the woods and finds Walter who he thinks he is turning into a werewolf and chases Hubie to a haunted house in a fun fair. Mr. And Mrs. Hennessey are kidnapped, and Sergeant Downey is alerted. At the haunted house, Hubie sees a husky, thinking it is Walter in werewolf form. Pete Landolfa (Ray Liotta) goes in to scare Hubie but is kidnapped in front of him. Sergeant Downey arrives and suggests to Mayor Benson (Batman Forever's George Wallace, also playing the Mayor) that Halloween is cancelled. Hubie thinks Walter is responsible, but Sergeant Blake (Keanan & Kel's Kenan Thompson) is holding Walter at the police station with Richie Hartman (Rob Schneider) after they have turned themselves in. Walter's real name is Nick Hudson, and is from the same mental institution as Richie, which they refer to as the werewolf treatment centre. Downey, Benson, and Dave agree that Hubie is the kidnapper, turning up whenever there is a disappearance, they think he wants revenge on his bullies. He runs away and goes to a radio station. DJ Aurora (Shaquille ""Shaq"" O'Neal, and the voice of Vivian Nixon) tells him that he is not the most frequent caller. Someone has planted a burner phone, and a call came from Hubie's house, and he races there, hoping his mother (June Squibb) is alright. It is revealed that Hubie's mother kidnapped Pete, Mike, and the Hennesseys as revenge for tormenting Hubie and plans to burn them alive. He rescues them as the police, Nick, and Richie arrive. Hubie's mother then scolds Pete, Mike, and the Hennesseys for all the things they did to Hubie, before she suddenly disappears. One year later, Hubie and Violet are married, Hubie is the new Mayor of Salem, and his new foster kids are going trick or treating dressed like people he knows. Having earned respect from the locals, Hubie goes into town on his bicycle with Downey escorting him and prepares for the Halloween festivities. Also starring Ben Stiller as Orderly Hal, Jackie Sandler (Adam's wife) as reporter Tracy Phillips, Noah Schnapp as Tommy, Sadie Sandler (Adam's daughter) as Danielle, Sunny Sandler (Adam's daughter) as Cooky, Paris Berelc as Megan, and China Anne McClain as Miss Chantal Taylor. Sandler putting on another goofy voice is highly annoying, and talents like James, Liotta, Buscemi and Rudolph are wasted playing equally odd or unlikeable characters. It tries its best to spoof scary movie conventions in some moments, and attempts some kind of mystery in the story, but it is complete devoid of any good jokes of any kind, visual, physical or worded, it is up there among the worst of Sandler's films, a pointless, boring and unfunny comedy horror. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Screen Combo for Adam Sandler & his grating simpleton voice, and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel (rip-off of Ernest Scared Stupid). Pretty poor!",Hubie Halloween
7,paul_haakonsen,"Good movie, once you get past Sandler's annoying voice...",6,10 October 2020,"Well, while I am not really much of a fan of Adam Sandler, as it tends to be pretty much the same stuff he does over and over, then I still found myself sitting down to watch the 2020 movie ""Hubie Halloween"" as it was readily available on Netflix. Granted, I didn't really have much of any expectations for the movie, nor did I know how was in it aside from Adam Sandler.And now that I have finished watching ""Hubie Halloween"", I must say that I was actually adequately entertained, and it turned out to be a wholesome movie. For me, it wasn't because of Adam Sandler or his annoying voice that he was doing in the movie, but it was a combination of the storyline and the rather amazing cast list that were here.Story-wise then ""Hubie Halloween"" was pretty straight forward. It was a storyline that had a little bit of everything in it, so it is very likely that you'll find something enjoyable in the movie, despite of your age and preference.Aside from the lead of Adam Sandler, then ""Hubie Halloween"" had the likes of great performers such as Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider, Ray Liotta, Maya Rudolph, Ben Stiller, Michael Chiklis and others on the cast list. I would be lying if I said that I was wasn't impressed with the ensemble that made an appearance in ""Hubie Halloween"".While ""Hubie Halloween"" is not going to be a regular Halloween classic, it is definitely a movie worth sitting down to watch - once at least. I am rating it a six out of ten stars.",Hubie Halloween
8,Calicodreamin,Meh,5,23 October 2020,"A fun concept with a few good laughs, but really not that great. An all star cast but most of the jokes fell flat and the storyline was a bit slow.",Hubie Halloween
9,Aaron1375,A harmless silly distraction.,7,12 October 2020,"I see by its score here that many people did not care for this film, and my question to them is why did you bother watching it? Adam Sandler has been around for a while now and has made numerous movies, so by now you should really know whether or not you are going to enjoy a movie by him or not. I am not his biggest fan, but then, I usually find my comedy from stuff like MST3K and Rifftrax rather than a movie. I watched this one, only because my wife started watching it and it caught my attention when I saw Ben Stiller at the beginning with that horrible mustache! So I watched and while it was silly and goofy and immature, it also provided a nice distraction from a very bad work week for me.The story starts out with a person escaping a mental institution and then switches to Hubie, a person who is a super nice guy who likes looking out for others, but who gets picked on constantly by the town bullies even at his advanced age. Well, a guy trying to play a prank on Hubie in a corn maze gets taken by something and soon so do others. Hubie suspects it is his new neighbor who may be a werewolf, the town officer thinks it is the escaped mental patient from the beginning and soon they will find out the truth!The cast is rather good as it was fun to see a lot of the old Saturday Night Live alum in roles as well as Sandler perennials Steve Buschemi and Kevin James. One person who I kept expecting to show up was David Spade, but he was curiously absent from this one, unless I just missed him some how.So, it is not a super great comedy at all, but I enjoyed it for what it was. I thought the story was harmless enough and I liked the ending as the mother had a really funny line about her destination. It plays out like one of the those films in the 90's featuring a popular Saturday Night Live character in a full movie and like those, it does get a bit too long in the tooth; however, Sandler's Hubie has a bit more depth than girl who folds her arms and the two clubbing brothers. Though, that is not really saying much now is it? In the end, pretty much your typical Sandler character movie, by that I mean he does a voice and tries to be someone totally different rather than when he plays just a regular guy like in Grown Ups or Big Daddy.",Hubie Halloween
10,trashgang,no brainer for the whole family,6,8 October 2020,"Guess one month ago I watched my first Adam Sandler flick and to be honest I liked it and I had to laugh here and there. With all the haters out there suddenly on netflix a new Sandler flick was out and yes, I watched it and enjoyed it again.This one, is just stupid, has an annoying voice, doesn't make sense and by doing so it all worked out fine and yep, I laughed again here and there and on the end credits with all the bloopers I laughed again.Not that it is a good comedy, but it's one out for the Halloween season and one to watch with younger kids, they will love it.Smart to add some names from long ago to this flick and for the young ones smart to add Noah Schnapp to it so all Stranger Things geeks will watch it and of course Julie Bowen from Modern family.I had fun with it.

11,deloudelouvain,Watchable because of the cast.,6,1 November 2020,"Adam Sandler, I can't say I'm a big fan of him, but I watched the movie anyway. This character fits him perfectly though. With his nerdy face he only has to change his voice a bit to become the perfect town retard. He did a fairly good job with his character. The story on the other hand is a bit childish, in other words it isn't a story that will be remembered as great cinema. The cast contains a lot of good actors what makes Hubie Halloween worth a watch, just don't expect too much of it or you will be disappointed.",Hubie Halloween

13,cruise01,Adam Sandler being himself along with the rest of the cast.,3,13 October 2020,1.5 out of 5 stars.Hubie Halloween is a comedy film about Hubie (Adam Sandler) who tries to supervise everyone in town for being safe during Halloween. Until strange occurrences happen.Pretty boring story. The humor being slapstick and dumb which lacked the laughs but annoying. Especially hearing Adam Sandler giving the scared scream like every other scene. By the time the credits roll your left more annoyed than entertained. The fun part of the movie is seeing the cameos by other celebrities from the Happ Madison production company. If you enjoy Adam Sandlers other cheesy comedy films. You may enjoy this. Otherwise it did not provide anything new. The humor is cheesy and dumb. The plot is boring. And the movie is forgettable.,Hubie Halloween
14,Floated2,Run of the mill Sandler comedy,4,8 October 2020,"Similar to Adam Sandler's other Netflix film, Hubie Halloween is a holiday centred comedy with a low end plot, many supporting characters and several weaker jokes. This film is simply harmless fun and in terms of Sandler's films, people should know his humor and relatively know what to expect.The lead character of Hubie was rather annoying (mainly due to the voice Sandler uses) as we are supposed to have sympathy for the character. The film spends a lot of time with characters mocking Hubie, and Hubie being in odd situations. The gags with his ""thermos"" was somewhat funny as it was continuous throughout.The ending isn't completely predictable, though it isn't exactly rewarding. Ultimately this film isn't great but it's a decent family viewing.",Hubie Halloween
15,eddie_baggins,Another low-end Sandler/Netflix collaboration,4,9 October 2020,"Before we delve into the streaming masterpiece that is Hubie Halloween, I think it would be right for all of us to remember the fact that last time we saw Netflix and Adam Sandler go hand in hand it was with the quite brilliant and unexpectedly unforgettable Uncut Gems, a film that if nothing else reminded us that when he tries, Sandler can in fact act.With that in mind and the memories of past Netflix exclusive collaborations like The Ridiculous 6, Murder Mystery, The Week Of and Sandy Wexler well and truly pushed to the back of our brains, Hubie Halloween is the exact type of film that Sandler has become known for in the latter stages of his career, a film that features his friends, low common denominator jokes (that skew heavily towards farts, spewing and urine) and a plot that is virtually non-existent.There's a place in the world for such crass and stupid films and in some ways in comforting in a year like 2020 that Sandler and his cronies can continue to keep on keeping on when it comes to churning out such juvenile and meaningless products but despite and interesting set-up that early on suggests we might actually be getting a more intriguing Sandler effort, Hubie Halloween is not even close to being funny enough to recommend, even if its slightly more tolerable than the worst of Sandler's last few decades of misfires.Giving us another one of his man-child characters, this time with an added lisp/accent that will take you some time to build up tolerance to, Sandler appears in almost every scene of Steven Brill's film as the dorkish and child-like Hubie Dubois who loves nothing more than seeing his home town of Salem celebrate Halloween in a safe manner, a scenario made trickier this time around due to the fact there's been a recent escape from a local mental asylum and a bunch of bully locals hell-bent on making Hubie's (aka Pubie's) life a living hell.It's the type of role Sandler could play in his sleep, one that barely requires him to muster an ounce of extra energy or enthusiasm to portray and there's not a lot of help from his loaded ensemble that includes Sandler BFF's Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Shaq and a scene-stealing Steve Buscemi, who all mostly get little to work with in the Halloween set plot that relies on signposted jokes and over the top gags to keep it afloat.It's hard to know exactly who this film is aimed at, its certainly not adults who will tire quickly of much of its antics and its a little too innuendo driven for the young crowd but Netflix surely won't mind as the film looks to play out strong over this Halloween centric period, with more Sandler/Netflix offerings already in the pipeline.Final Say -More tolerable than some of the other Sandler/Netflix outings that have come our way over the last 5 years, Hubie Halloween has a great setting and a potentially fantastic premise but is let down by a lack of laughs, likable characters and its uninspired delivery.2 Swiss Army Thermos out of 5",Hubie Halloween
16,damianphelps,Sandler looks and sounds like he is having a stroke for the entire movie!,5,18 October 2020,Just to clarify my perspective...I like Sandler.This movie is JUST funny enough to be average and provide a few laughs so that by the end of it you don't feel like you have completely wasted your time.The worst part of the movie was that it felt like Sandler owed his friends and every kid that has worked for Disney a favour and to pay it back he put them in the movie. Considering how many 'funny' people are in this it should be much funnier.I can't think of a best part it was more a collection of smaller funny parts (and it does have a few genuine laughs).Its ok.,Hubie Halloween

Yet, he owns a deli/supermarket? and everyone in the town dislikes him? makes fun of him?The all-star cast is impressive. I'm guessing Sandler pulled out all his favors with the number of A-list stars.I don't care for the bullying and the kids being disrespectful to the main character. I get it, kids will cause mischief, but they have a roaming gang of these bullies and the parents and law enforcement does nothing? Is this supposed to be reflective of Salem?I did not like this movie. The kids might and simple minded people, also the fanboys of Sandler's sense of humor, but I did not care for it.

But Pixels was his fun to me, has we'll has Anger Managment(2003). Where does Hubie Halloween fall into that, we'll it's pretty bad, the plot goes all around, it's what you'd expect from this type of Adam Sandler comedy, but there where two times I did laugh.
Adam Sandler gives an over the top performance as Hubie, to the point where he seems to animated to be a real character that can be relatable, Julie Bowen is in this movie just to have a love interest for Sandler, nothing more. And everything else falls flat, Kevin James looks like he's not having any fun here. Halloween comedies can be done, but Hubie Halloween does not quite do it.",Hubie Halloween
24,alindsay-al,Adam Sandler's attempt at the worst film ever,2,7 October 2020,"So Adam Sandler said if he didn't win the Oscar for his performance in Uncut Gems then he was going to make the worst film ever and here it is Hubie Halloween and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a man who loves Halloween but ridiculed amongst his town have to save the people from certain peril.Main Character
It must be rare to see an actor give one of the best performances of the year for a film and then also give one of the worst performances of the year in another but Sandler has managed to do it. He is so bad here, it is like he is trying to challenge Water Boy but it doesn't work here in this day and age and it is horrendous here. The voice is so weird and he is actually quite hard to understand and even though you are clearly meant to care, never for one minute did I care about him, also for a guy who loves Halloween so much why does he get so scared of everything, it makes no sense.Supporting Characters
There are some fun supporting characters here, mainly because of the shock value that they would actually be a part of this film, I mean it is full of comedic talent and they rise the film up a bit but not much. I don't want to spoil them just in case you don't know, because I didn't know and it made me enjoy this film a little bit, but then there are some really bad performances. Kevin James is used to being in Sandler films and he is just not funny here, he just phones it in and is happy to get another paycheck in another terrible film. Julie Bowen who I actually think is funny in Modern Family is also really bad here, she is so over the top and the writing for her character is also bad and makes her just seem so stupid.Story
The story actually has quite a nice story to it about accepting others and not being mean to them due to insecurities about yourself, but that is all it has. The relationships between the characters is poor and the twist involving the villains is unnecessary and actually makes no sense and makes you scratching your head as to why certain things are here. I mean there is this romance between these two kids and it is such a weird thing to add here and adds nothing to the film at all, it feels like they had a 45 minute plot and had to pad out the remaining hour to make it a feature length film.Script
Now the most important thing in a comedy, unless I have it wrong is to make you laugh and this film didn't make me laugh once, which means it fails. It is basic and not good humour, I would say it was made for kids but then it makes adult jokes and you just aren't sure who the hell this movie is for and why it even exists.Style
Now the most important thing of a horror film is to be scary and this film fails that as well, so it fails as a comedy and a horror so this style is all over the place. Things just aren't scary or spooky at all and it makes this film feel way longer then it has any right to be and just don't bother with it.Overall
Well I don't think it is the worst film ever but it is still awful and should be avoided at all cost. I know people will tell me just to turn my mind off and enjoy it for what it is, but no that excuse didn't work for The Wrong Missy and it doesn't work here and hopefully this crew just stops making these comedies and retire so we don't have to put up with this any more.",Hubie Halloween

This movie is a return to the nonsense Sandler and Friends adventures that have become so loathsome of late. The bigger issue for this though is I have no idea who it's for.Hubie has a serious identity issue. Is this a kids movie? An adult comedy? A family film? I don't think it really fits in any of them. It's two mature for kids, to dumb for adults and it's frankly to stupid for the family dog too. We get more wish fulfillment from Sandler, playing this character who's great at everything, until he's suddenly not for some inexplicable reason, who despite being a nutter is somehow just catnip to the most attractive woman in town? We've got Kevin James as a sheriff who looks a bit like Dog the Bounty Hunter, Buscemi slumming it as... Everything about this annoyed me. It reminds me of the Ernest movies by Jim Varney, but those were clearly aimed at kids and were much more enjoyable, partly because of how stupid they were.If this would've picked a lane it could have been better. Make it Sandler Scared Stupid, a goofy Halloween movie for his kids or Big Hubie, the story of a man coming to grips with his adulthood around Halloween. Either could have been better but this middle of the road nonsense, flooded with his own wish fulfillment and constant need to shove his buddies into things they don't need to be in leaves us with another garbage movie. You've got to think Netflix thought they would get more from this once legendary comedy actor when they made their deal with him and instead all they've given me is regret. Absolute garbage, there are better Halloween movies out there, go watch any of those instead.",Hubie Halloween
29,aidanratesmovies,Better than Sandler's most recent comedic efforts- Buscemi steals the show,6,8 October 2020,"Silly, stupid, but ultimately more bareable to watch than most of his film's- Sandler's latest flick has a decent amount of humor in it that surprisingly lands, although it certainly isn't great or even good in any way. What I love most about this film was Steve Bechumi's performance as Walter Lambert. He honestly steals the show in every scene he takes a part of, and is the most enjoyable part of this film. Sandler's weird voice can be a bit of an annoyance after a while, for some it may even be from the very get go, but Sandler does bring humanity to the character in a nice, if corny, sort of way. This film also stars frequent Sandler alum Kevin James, Rob Schneider, and Shaq who I guess can be considered one now too for some reason. For the most part all of them prove to be quite funny. I wasn't a huge fan of Tim Meadows or Julie Bowen's performance throughout, nothing I hadn't seen before anyway, but I did enjoy the cameo of Ben Stiller at the beginning- which for some, just may make their day. This film is packed with stars, insults, and gags- and I can say that some of it works. It's not much I suppose in a turn of film, but I was entertained watching it. I was never bored, and there's some continuing gags I chuckled along with throughout. The visuals are nice, and there certainly is a fun feeling of nostalgia present throughout the film, which I think any fan of Sandler's, halloween, or both will enjoy. In the end, Hubie Halloween is nothing special, but it's Sandler's best comedy film in quite a while. That may not mean much, but it proves to be, for the most part a decent watch, and if worse comes to worse, a fun movie to have on in the background.My Rating: 6/10.",Hubie Halloween

31,AudioFileZ,Sandler & Pals Having Some Fun With Halloween,5,14 October 2020,"Uh, it's an Adam Sandler movie. It's a spoof of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts starring Sandler's typical quirky characters played by his buds. It's thoroughly stupid yet sometimes clever. Adam uses that irritating deceptively old simpleton voice. In these things it actually lives up to expectations and is watchable, dare I say extremely modestly entertaining. Definitely will come and go as quick as the day it revolves around so see it or forget it.",Hubie Halloween
32,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Fun Family Halloween Movie that Feels like a Watered Down Happy Madison,6,3 December 2020,"This is a movie that I really only watched because of my Halloween episode for Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast. I realized that I needed to do something for the holiday and I couldn't find a 2020 release that was focused on it. This one I really debated hard and figured it would be horror enough. The synopsis here is despite his devotion to his hometown of Salem (and its Halloween celebration), Hubie Dubois (Adam Sandler) is a figure of mocker for kids and adults alike. But this year, something is going bump in the night and it's up to Hubie to save Halloween.We start this off at a mental hospital. Orderly Hal (Ben Stiller) busts into a room to find that the resident there is missing. He calls it in that Richie Hartman (Rob Schneider) has escaped. This information gets relayed that he's coming back to Salem to the officer in charge, Sgt. Steve Downey (Kevin James).In this town though, we're following around Hubie. He loves the holiday, but he's bullied by everyone. We see him as he has to dodge things that kids throwing at him, one of which is Andy O'Doyle (Tyler Crumley). Hubie is great at avoiding things, but he tends to get distracted and crash his bike. The first time is due to seeing Violet Valentine (Julie Bowen). He's had a crush on her since the second grade and she was the nicest girl in school.Some background here is that Violet was married to Sgt. Downey. They're now divorced and she has adopted 3 children. There is Tommy (Noah Schnapp), Danielle (Sadie Sandler) and Cooky (Sunny Sandler). She has a crush on Hubie, but he doesn't seem to notice it.Hubie really has a rough go at it though and I can't stress that enough. He is bullied by Mr. Landolfa (Ray Liotta), Mrs. Hennessey (Maya Rudolph), Lester Hennessey (Tim Meadows), Father Dave (Michael Chiklis), Deli Mike Mundi (Karan Brar) and pretty much all the kids too. He just wants everyone to enjoy Halloween and despite what he goes through, he keeps a positive outlook. He also has his Inspector Gadget thermos that is like a Swiss army knife and has different machines that can be used from it.He does still live with his mother, June Squibb. She wants him to toughen up before she passes on, but it doesn't seem likely. Things start to get weird though when Walter Lambert (Steve Buscemi) moves in next door. He says some weird things to Hubie about ignoring weird sounds coming from his house. There is also Richie Hartman coming back as well.Halloween starts off as it normally does with Hubie out trying to police people to do the right things. We learn that he's a bit of a snitch, which doesn't help him. People around him start to disappear. He thinks it is Walter and Hubie believes him to be a werewolf. What is really happening on this spooky night in Salem?Upon finishing this movie, it is really hard to call this a horror movie. I'm still going to include it as it does play with a lot of elements and since I would consider Ernest Scared Stupid, then I have to include this. It really is in the same vein as like Hocus Pocus in that it is a family friendly horror movie. What is weird is that it feels like if you watered down Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore so you could watch it with children of all ages.There is a good Halloween feel here though for sure. Placing it in Salem was good. Having the backdrop of witches, werewolves or something supernatural really helps there. Don't come in expecting it to be too scary though, because you will be disappointed. What I will give though is the uplifting message it gives. Hubie is bullied his whole life, but no matter what he stays positive. It is easier said than done for sure. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I teared up a bit at the end.What did make me chuckle here is all the references to previous movies from Sandler's universe. James obvious has been in Grown-Ups. Bowen was in Happy Gilmore. Buscemi and Schneider are long time guys who've made at least cameos in many of his films. Meadows knew them as well from Saturday Night Live. They brought back O'Doyle from Billy Madison. Stiller is his character from Happy Gilmore. It also seems like there's a person dressed in a haunted house as the demon like things from Little Nicky.There are also references in my opinion to classic horror films as well. Not necessarily a horror film, but there's the troupe that Hubie is the boy who cried wolf with his snitching on people. Richie Hartman acts similar to Michael Myers from Halloween. He is wearing a pig mask which could be Motel Hell or Saw. There's a car scene similar to Christine. There is also another aspect with tracing a phone call to be like Black Christmas. I'm also thinking with the radio station is homage to The Fog. There is a reveal that I can't here without going into spoilers, but it is another from the slasher genre. Another that isn't a movie reference is the call letters to the radio station are WTCH.I'll move this over to the acting. It was fun. No one really stood out or do anything to blow me away. Sandler is playing another of his characters, just doing the voice a bit different. James is fine as this peaked in high school cop. Bowen is still quite attractive. She does a lot of overacting. Liotta, Buscemi, Schneider, Rudolph, Meadows, Chiklis, Squibb, George Wallace, Kenan Thompson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kym Whitley, Lavell Crawford, Dan Patrick and the rest are all fine in their cameo roles. I did have to confirm it first, Paris Berelc is quite attractive.There's not really a lot in the way of effects. The look and feel of Halloween is there. That ambience works for me. The CGI used for Hubie when he's dodging things is a bit much and didn't really hold up. I'm not a big fan of the cheesiness with his thermos that he has. There is a supernatural aspect that I think they should have a fleshed out a bit. I think I get what they're meaning, but something more would have worked better. The cinematography is fine aside from that.I will also give credit to the soundtrack of the movie. They use things like Monster Mash, The Purple People Eater, Ghostbusters' theme, Twilight Zone's Main Theme and Werewolves of London to just name a few. This also probably helped with the feel of the movie as well.So now with that said, is this a great movie? No, it doesn't even rank near the top of Sandler movies for me. What I will say though is that they did a pretty solid family film that has horror elements and really embodies the feel of Halloween. It has a good message. There are some fun cameos. I think it could have gone just a bit farther with some stuff, but I'm not really the target. For me, I'd say this is just over average for me. It is fun with a good message, just lacking something to really make it stand out.",Hubie Halloween

34,Kamurai25,"""Hubie Doobie Dudley Doo Right""",6,7 October 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend. (At least for Halloween comedies.)This is definitely a Adam Sandler/Happy Madison Halloween story, through and through. Lots of dirt humor throughout, and way too many pee jokes.While it tries to put a wholesome ""life lesson"" twist on it, but as the whole movie is satirical, it doesn't come off sincere at all. Almost like it's promoting abuse as funny.The humor is questionable at points, but the majority of the movie is really enjoyable with a pretty well written script and some really great moments throughout the movie.As it moves into a mystery movie it relies less on the investigation and traditional ""drip feeding"" of information on discovery and more of a battle against almost everyone in the town basically wanting Hubie dead. It is weirdly dark in that regard.You'll probably have a good time, but will most likely come out the other side with a, ""Well, that was weird."".",Hubie Halloween

36,arungeorge13,It's alright for what it is - a silly Sandler comedy! [+48%],5,8 October 2020,"Hubie Halloween signals a return to comfort zone for Adam Sandler (who plays Hubie Dubois, a mom-loving, man-child-ish do-gooder). Modeled along the lines of a feel-good Halloween reunion, it's safe to say that Hubie Halloween isn't the worst Sandler comedy out there. Let's start with the few positives. The tees that Hubie's mom (played by June Squibb) wears throughout the film, cracked me up. The nods to Sandler's earlier movies (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison) and the comedic jibes taken at some old movies (Rocky Balboa, The Fog, just to name a few) are also decently done. The cameos of Ben Stiller and Shaq were amusing. Plus, as the title suggests, it's very much a Halloween film - the vibes are all over the place.Now, onto the annoying aspects. Sandler's voice in the film is tweaked for whatever-funny effect but it doesn't really serve a purpose in the plot. Speaking of the plot, it's a big bundle of clichés and gets a little message-heavy at the end. While it's fine to see Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi, Maya Rudolph, and several other Sandler-buddies in supporting roles, no one really gets anything solid to do. More of a plot problem again than that of the actors' really. Treat Hubie Halloween for what it is (a goofy comedy!) and you may find it mildly enjoyable.",Hubie Halloween

39,blott2319-1,Far from the worst (and the best) Adam Sandler film,6,29 October 2020,"Lately I've been having a rather tumultuous relationship with the films of Adam Sandler. Some work for me even though they fail for others, and some make me want to put my fist through the TV screen. I was leery of Hubie Halloween, but my wife is an avid fan of Halloween and likes movies that explore the holiday, so we gave it a shot. There are small moments of the old Adam Sandler magic in this film that I tried to cling to and enjoy. Some comedic bits work because they are so ridiculous that they feel like something out of a Mel Brooks parody film. I must admit I had some hearty laughs at the running gags, and the way they would escalate the jokes. For example, there was something that tickled me about a thermos that acts like a Swiss army knife with all its uses. Plus the whole mystery that is built up throughout the film was decent, even if it was predictable. Watching antagonistic people get payback for their actions isn't so bad.The biggest detriment to Hubie Halloween was Adam Sandler himself. I cannot figure out why he insists on these terrible voices in some films, but it's kind of astounding that he hasn't realized what works in a 5-minute SNL sketch doesn't translate to a 100-minute movie. I got so annoyed every time Hubie spoke because of that dumb speech pattern. The character could be funny and downright endearing if he would just play it straight, or make him a bit childish and naive but without the stupid way of talking. The ending also becomes less satisfying and less realistic because of his acting choices. Kevin James is also a trainwreck in Hubie Halloween. He's intended to be an obnoxious character, so I guess he was successful, but I didn't think he fit in with any of the other people in the movie. Admittedly, I didn't hate Hubie Halloween as much as the truly atrocious Adam Sandler films, but it also won't become an annual holiday tradition for us to watch it each year.",Hubie Halloween
40,aciessi,Hubie Hullabaloo,4,9 October 2020,"They say it's Adam Sandler's best comedy in years. That's the word on the street. Um, no it isn't. It's the exact same cringey, over-the-top, poo poo, pee pee, juvenile crap he's been making for decades. It's Grown Ups 3, essentially. But for some reason, people are having a much warmer reaction to it than the other films he's made recently. What is going on here? I have three theories.1) The wacky spirit of Halloween is fitting for a Happy Madison production.2) Much of the film's humor isn't mean-spirited, which is in contrast to other Happy Madison films, which feel like they were written by a 12 year-old bully.3) 2020 has been such a dystopian hellscape that a bad Adam Sandler comedy feels like a salvation in how normal it is, thus creating a placebo effect in which people think it's good.Whatever the reason may be, Hubie Halloween is a hit.

Maybe one of the worst ever. Now, maybe I'm wrong, but all the friends I watched it with agree that all we could take from the viewing experience was the strong feeling that almost no one involved with the film cared or put any effort into making anything about it good, even in the slightest, aside from maybe June Squibb, who is a wonder and we are all graced anytime she is on the screen. Her presence is one of the only positive things about this film, but I'd rather watch her in one of Alexander Payne's brilliant offerings. Steve Buscemi is always pleasant too, but it's not enough to save this heap.After seeing Uncut Gems (a very good movie), I got distracted for a second and almost forgot JUST how bad these Adam Sandler movies can really be. Hubie Halloween was an important reminder, and it takes the cake as the worst one I have ever seen. I don't blame Sandler and his crew for blasting out these diarrhea-tier offerings - I would do the exact same thing if I were them. They are lucky folks to be in the position they are, but, I guarantee that even they know these movies are the lowest of the low.

I had a few good laughs throughout and there's a decent enough spooky twist in the end. I believe the issue is that Sandler's antics don't come across like they would've maybe 20 years ago. Is it ok to make fun of a middle aged man with some sort of mental issue? No. That's where the message comes in to explain to younger viewers bullying is not ok in any shape or form.

It's also the time of year were we spend countless hours watching horror films, and it's also the time when we get stupid comedies that aren't so bad that they're good, they are just bad. Hubie Halloween the latest Adam Sandler and Netflix team up 'comedy' is just that. Last year Sandler built himself a reputation as a guy who can actually act given the right material as the gambling jeweler in Uncut Gems. So good of a reputation in fact that he was praised for his good work, this is perhaps the opposite. It's not the Safdie Brothers' literal diamond mine of a film...nope Hubie is the bad mine, the one with no diamonds and should be condemned. Sandler is Hubie a devout Halloween connoisseur who is picked on and teased by the entire town of Salem, Massachusetts. He's essentially the same character as in Waterboy or Little Nicky or maybe even Billy Maddison you know that kind of annoying character that you just want to smack in the chops and hope they never speak again. But unlike the aforementioned Maddison who is actually good Hubie is awful in comparison, he's the kind of person you only see in a bad dream. And that's exactly what this film is, it's a bad dream. It's not funny, or charming and has about as much personality as a cigarette that was stomped out 20 years ago, around the time Sandler did this type of film.

All of Adam Sandlers regulars are here. Kevin james, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi, and unfortunately Rob Schneider. They are also not so good. Really the best quality of this is just the Halloween setting. Which is maybe why I enjoyed this more then I thought.
The direction is a bit better then normal, there's some semblance of a story, and some jokes actually land. There's lots of questionable choices naturally but I didn't want to blow my brains out watching it. Also, why are there so many Disney Kids in this?

Also at times some of the gags without giving to much away were repeated several times to the point where it got annoying more then anything.Second while I do understand the voice Adam Sandler was doing was needed to portray the role of the character he was playing. At times I often couldn't understand or hear what he was saying. It just was too overbearing overall.Lastly I found the movie at times to be a bit draggy. They could have cut off at least 20-25 minutes from the film and still got the point across they were trying to portray.Besides for all that I did enjoy the cast very much there was alot of great cameos in this film, and without giving to much info away the ending was cute, emotional, and definitely a good message.

Tonight's movie review is the scary spooky comedy Hubie Halloween (2020) where Sandman plays Hubie Dubois, a Salem resident who is always bullied by everyone and is classed as the town's target for being goofy and kind. Hubie's talents include his swiss army style thermostat, his mileage of yelling like he's about to die and his detective work which he utilises the most on his favourite day, Halloween. One this particular dark and spooky night a few local residents go missing so its up to Hubie to step up and become a hero. The Ben Stiller cameo by reprising his Hal L character from Happy Gilmore and his line ""special delivery for Mr Loon E Tunes"" was cool as. Plus, the O'Doyle references were awesome to watch along with the monster mash tune throughout the flick. A few gags and the constant pranks were funny and the typical story of the town outcast will save the day, win the town over and even get the girl was good to watch. All of this predictability is forgivable at times and the movie was enjoyable due to a few cameos including from the Shaq man. Overall, funny moments and Sandler always screaming as if he will die next sec 5.6/10",Hubie Halloween

64,tmccull52,Why?,2,14 October 2020,"Why even make this movie? It's essentially a Saturday Night Live skit that ran about an hour and a half too long. Despite what is supposed to be a fairly talented cast, the film is wholly unappealing. It's not funny in the least.Surprise, surprise; Adam Sandler plays an amiable, hapless boob with zero personal appeal. Jeepers, who'd have seen that coming? I'm a huge Julie Bowen fan, and I loved on ""Modern Family"", but she is completely wasted... and thoroughly unconvincing as the ""hot mom"" figure who secretly harbors a crush on Adam Sandler's hopeless idiot character. Anyone with a third of a brain and an ounce of self-respect wouldn't be attracted to the Hubie Dubois character in the least, but Bowen's character, Violet Valentine, has the same crush on Hubie that he has for her, although both are unaware of this unspoken attraction for one another.There's nothing in this movie that we haven't seen from Adam Sandler 5,000 times already. Help from real-life buddies Kevin James, Tim Meadows, Maya Rudolph, and Ben Stiller is futile, as they aren't any funnier than Sandler is in this crap fest. Normally, I'm entertained by anything that Steve Buscemi is in, but even the usually reliable and likeable Buscemi can't defuse this bomb.Watch grass grow. Watch paint dry. Both options are more compelling and interesting than ""Hubie Halloween"".",Hubie Halloween
65,TheVictoriousV,Sandler couldn't even give us the grand disaster he promised,5,12 October 2020,"Writing about movies in the digital age has broken me. In an age where filter-bubble fanboyism runs rampant (encouraged by Facebook and Twitter communities reserved for whoever consumes the ""correct"" product), I have observed that nothing riles up defensive devotees quite like pointing out irreconcilable flaws in the works they admire.All of my blog reviews get copied to IMDb, and due to how fandom has started to operate, I no longer take poor ratings on my reviews as a sign that I've failed to properly articulate the problems with the film and need to improve my writing; instead, I assume I was onto something that the lemmings didn't like. Nobody who's this terrible should have this much hubris, guys. I'll never learn anything at this rate!Today, I might once again draw the ire of Adam Sandler fans. And keep in mind, after Punch-Drunk Love and especially last year's Uncut Gems, I am also a Sandler fan; or rather, Sandler as he should have been. With Hubie Halloween, it's back to oafish, scatological basics, but not without quaint October charm - IndieWire referred to the look of this film as ""pumpkin-spice production design"", which is quite cute.Some people have even called the movie nostalgic; in many ways, it is a call-back to everything that Happy Madison has given us (ranging from horrible to acceptable) throughout the years, complete with Ben Stiller reprising a character from Happy Gilmore (one viewer, however, told me he liked The Waterboy and Little Nicky better ""when they were two separate films""). Outside of these endearing qualities, the movie doesn't offer anything too exciting - in either direction.There is a tinge of disappointment to this verdict, not because I expected Hubie Halloween to be one of the better Adam Sandler comedies but because I expected Pixels-tier trash. And Sandler, in a sense, agrees with me here.When I reviewed Uncut Gems, I said that he had reinvented himself as an ""actor for grown-ups"" and that, thanks to that film, he ""might just get to play with the big boys full-time and even score his first Oscar"". Sandler himself went on record as saying, if he doesn't receive an Oscar or at the very least a nomination for his role as Howard Bling, then it's back to Netflix; he promised he'd make something even more inane, awkward, and racially insensitive than The Ridiculous 6. Alas, he has failed to astound.His story of a Salem-based, frequently-ridiculed Halloween monitor getting pulled into a strange mystery isn't too bad on paper, and the execution has its share of Halloween warmth and fun cameos (the casts boasts the star power of Steve Buscemi, Ray Liotta, Rob Schneider of course, Julie Bowen, June Squibb, Shaq, and many more). Sadly, the rest is the usual Happy Madison annoyance, albeit less obnoxiously impactful than usual.",Hubie Halloween

Even for kids, who are the target audience of this family comedy, some scenes are just too weird and absurd.With a cast like this, with names like Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi or Julie Bowen, I expected at least that one joke would make me laugh, and it didn't.When I start watching a movie, I go 'till the end, so I went all the way with this one, and survived (narrowly).",Hubie Halloween

71,Jared_Andrews,A Little Light Halloween Fun,5,20 October 2020,"I turned this movie on the other night and figured I would take a small taste, spit it out, and move on. But that's not what happened.I watched the first few moments and rolled my eyes, but I did so in a loving way, the way a child might at his dad for being slightly embarrassing, yet charming and undeniably himself. That's Adam Sandler in 'Hubie Halloween.' Sure, he's silly and slightly embarrassing, but I love him and accept him for who he is.And another thing: he made me laugh and smile. I can't help but like the guy. He has a way of winning people over, even in movies that are less than stellar.Fortunately, this movie truly is not bad. It has quite a bit going for it, including an endless supply of recognizable actors, a cute romance warming slowly throughout, and a mystery with just enough juice to keep the action moving. I wanted to keep watching. I wanted to see what happened next. Did I expect a shocking twist to make me gasp or some profound revelation to make me think? Not really, and I was okay with that.This is a breezy movie that features people I like and centers on Halloween. That's all I wanted. If I had one bone to pick, I wish Sandler's Hubie character was bit more Mr. Deeds and little less Bobby Boucher ('The Waterboy'). That change plus a couple plot tweaks and this could have been a real Halloween classic I would watch every year. Alas, this version will do just fine.",Hubie Halloween
72,kingofdanerds,Just another Adam Sandler movie,5,1 November 2020,"Hubie Halloween is a 2020 Halloween Adam Sandler comedy produced by the Happy Madison production company. The film was released on the Netflix streaming service in October 2020. The film stars Adam Sandler and a cast of frequent collaborators like Kevin James, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider, and even Shaquille O'Neal. The film was dedicated to Cameron Boyce who was supposed to appear in the film but sadly died before production began. The film itself has recieved mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike.The film follows Hubie Dubois (played by Adam Sandler) who gets bullied by literally everyone in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. Hubie loves Halloween and wants everyone to be safe on Halloween. But when news of an asylum patient escaping, a possible werewolf, and people going missing, it is up to Hubie to figure out what exactly is going on in the town of Salem.Well, first of all, if you love Adam Sandler movies, you will probably like this film. If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler comedies, then you will not like this film. Personally, I am always in the middle of the arguement when it comes to Adam Sandler comedies and this film is no exception. The humor in this film is the type of humor you would expect out of an Adam Sandler comedy. Bodily function humor is mostly the type of humor in these type of films and in the first few minutes of this film you will get bodily function jokes. Which is largely unfunny. Humor like that is not clever and when it comes to Adam Sandler comedies, I always expect those type of jokes. But I will give Hubie Halloween credit because this film does get some laughs out of me. (More than I would care to admit). Now, the humor is really good when something completely random happens and catches the viewer off guard. There are several moments where that happens and it is still not clever but it is better than the immature bodily function humor that is in a majority of Sandler comedies. With that being said, this is probably the best Sandler comedy to come out in recent years (and that is saying a lot and also not saying very much either). Most of the time Adam Sandler himself is not funny (actually the supporting cast is funnier and I do give them credit here). The acting is what you would mostly expect in an Adam Sandler comedy. The characters are the same. But there are some things that I have to point out. First of all, why is everyone a huge jerk to Hubie? Everyone pretty much bully poor Hubie for no apparant reason. It does not make a whole lot of sense. Also, this is one of those Adam Sandler films where he talks in a voice that is mostly hard to understand. It can get annoying but it is not close to how annoying as his Jill voice from Jack and Jill. Another thing is Hubie's crush. First of all, her character sucks. But the point I am trying to get at is that, why does Hubie have to worry about her not liking him? It appears that she already likes him and she does not appear to ever have disliked him so why didn't she marry him beforehand? Pointless.... Like I said earlier, the supporting cast is funnier than Sandler most of the time here. The story was kind of a downer (though that probably should not come as any surprise). Before watching this film, I had no idea what this film was about and had this idea that it was gonna be like a Goosebumps type of story (honestly that would be pretty cool the more I think about it). When the film first starts, it appears it might be that way. We have someone escaping an asylum. But all of that adds up to nothing really. The film does have suspense at certain points in the film. The ending is kind of a downer and tries to have this message about bullying which is something that is important to talk about, but I am not sure if this is the right film for that. People have Halloween traditions where they watch a specific Halloween themed movie every Halloween whether it be A Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus, or even John Carpenter's Halloween. Hubie Halloween is not a film that would be a Halloween tradition (at least for me). I don't think it captures the Halloween spirit as well as some of the Halloween classics that have become a tradition.For many, Hubie Halloween is just another Adam Sandler movie. But for me, it made me laugh more than I would like to admit. It is not anywhere clsoe to being great but it is definitely not the worst Adam Sandler film.",Hubie Halloween
73,aprilsfriendorin,What even was this,2,8 November 2020,"I know Adam Sandler movies are usually filled with a weird combination of childish and adult humor, and usually have a fair amount of cringe in them, but this was worse than the usual Sandler style movie... It was just plain bad. Most of the jokes just weren't funny, and the weird sexual comments thrown in amongst fart jokes just makes it unclear who exactly this movie is for. And the voice Sandler used was just so annoying... Every time he spoke made me want to bang my head against the wall. Ultimately, this is a pretty uneventful Halloween movie about a man with mental defects getting bullied. The only redeeming part of it is the cast, who for some strange reason agreed to be in this thing.",Hubie Halloween

Yes this film is cheap on some laughs, in other words some jokes work, some don't and some just go dry very quickly.
The film itself went by quite fast and to see how many stars were in this movie was also a bonus.
Sandler did a pretty good job in his role, I was hoping that Kevin James and Ray 'who should be a bigger star' Liotta had bigger roles but never mind.
Okay the went really corny when the mum did a speech but I was glad it didn't last to long.
Overall don't expect a brilliant movie because it's not, the film isn't to bad just switch your brain off and remember that the film is aimed at teenagers.
Worth a watch.",Hubie Halloween
79,hunter-friesen,"Same old Sandler in ""Hubie Halloween""",4,15 October 2020,"Last year, Adam Sandler said that if he didn't win an Oscar for his role as Howard Ratner in the Safdie brother's film ""Uncut Gems"", he would then make the worst movie of his career on purpose. It was a bold claim to make, especially considering Sandler is the one responsible for ""Jack and Jill"" and ""Pixels"", two movies that almost made me quit watching movies altogether.Oscar nomination morning came in January and Sandler's name wasn't called when they announced the Best Actor lineup. I gasped and immediately checked Sandler's IMDb page and noticed that he had a new movie called ""Hubie Halloween"" that would premiere October 7. I knew that day would be the day of reckoning, the day Sandler would take his revenge on all of us.October 7 arrived and ""Hubie Halloween"" premiered on Netflix as promised. To my surprise, the movie was only passably bad and not the ungodly abomination we were led to believe.""Hubie Halloween"" takes place over the spookiest month of the year in Salem, Massachusetts. Hubie Dubois (Sandler) is the town's self-appointed Halloween safety monitor. Because of his overall demeanor and lack of style, Hubie is the most bullied person in town. But this year's Halloween will be like no other as a mental patient has escaped from the local lockup and town residents are disappearing one-by-one throughout the night. Like all underdog stories, it's up to Hubie to save Halloween. And as always, there's a love interest that is way out of his league that he will attempt to win over.If you're familiar with Sandler's filmography, you'll notice that the cast is stacked with the usual crowd of Sandler's buddies and Saturday Night Live alums. Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi, June Squibb, Tim Meadows, Maya Rudolph, Julie Bowen, and Shaquille O'Neal round out the supporting cast here.Trying to fit all these characters and give them their own little moments makes ""Hubie Halloween"" a tiresome experience. Even at 102-minutes (with 15 of those minutes for the credits), much of the runtime feels padded to make way for one-note gags about physical deformities and poop & pee jokes. At least there isn't the casual racism and sexism that Sandler used to parade around in his movies. He is growing up; just really, really slowly.What hasn't grown up is Sandler's schtick. Like Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey, Sandler's brand of humor doesn't age well once you pass the age of 20. It also doesn't help that Sandler is now 54-years-old and has been playing the same character for nearly four decades.Hubie Dubois is a near replication of Sandler's role as Bobby Boucher from 1998's ""The Waterboy"". Like Bobby, Hubie lives with his oblivious mother and talks with a weird mumbly accent. At least Bobby's accent was explained as that movie took place in Louisiana. Hubie's weird manner of speaking is never explained and exponentially grates as time goes on. It's both commendable and sad to see Sandler play a loser for what seems like the one-millionth time.While any praise given to ""Hubie Halloween"" is minor in scale, it is worth mentioning. The moments where the movie steps away from reality and enters more surreal territory make for enjoyable bits. Hubie's seemingly magic thermos - which acts as a vacuum, flashlight, megaphone, and grappling hook - does provide a chuckle here and there.Some of the supporting performances within ""Hubie Halloween"" do provide some slight fun.Steve Buscemi is allowed to embrace his cooky self as an elderly werewolf who has just moved next door to Hubie.June Squibb is also great as Hubie's mother. Unawarely dressed in sexually promiscuous t-shirts, Squibb plays the usual mother role quite well.Even though her character would fail the Bechdel test in a heartbeat, Julie Bowen does some pleasant work as Hubie's love interest.Rob Schneider and Maya Rudolph are great because they limit their dialogue to only a few lines. The more they speak, the worse the movie gets.Considering how 2020 has gone so far, Adam Sandler delivering his worst movie would have fit right in. Thankfully, the Sandman let us off easy and only gave us an inoffensively bad movie that could have been a lot worse.Maybe it was all part of his master plan to quell our expectations and have us grade this on a curve. Whatever the reason may be, I'll count my blessings and pray that Sandler doesn't try to deliver on his promise anytime soon.",Hubie Halloween

86,MovieBuff11732,An Adam Sandler Film Better Than A Bunch Of His Recent Flicks,7,20 October 2020,"Hubie Halloween is a movie that I didn't know was coming at all. It sort of came out of nowhere. I also came into the film expecting something like Murder Mystery or Romeo And Juliet but got something better than what I expected.Hubie Halloween is about a fifty year old man named Hubie (Adam Sandler) who still lives with his mom (June Squibb). Halloween is rolling around and Hubie loves this holiday so much that he always goes around to many kids reminding them to be safe on Halloween. Hubie falls in love with a girl name Violet Valentine (Julie Bowen) but still gets bullied by his childhood bully, Mr. Landofa (Ray Liotta). He then realizes many people around town are missing and contacts Srgt. Steve Downey (Kevin James) and they go on mission to find out what is happening to all of these people.Hubie Halloween was a film that relatively surprised me. As I said earlier I came into it thinking it was going to be like Murder Mystery or Romeo And Juliet but came out liking it much more than I thought. By no means is it a perfect film though. The story isn't too investing in this film. It is mainly centered around referencing older Halloween films and many actors that were featured in other Happy Maddison productions. That just isn't the way to structure a story. The film does start off with a mind of its own but then just fluctuates into your typical Adam Sandler cheesy film. Which is what I have came to aspect now when watching a Happy Madison production.The acting in this film is a little better than your typical Happy Maddison film which I am pleased to say. Adam Sandler delivers an okay performance for his character Hubie. He does add some emotion to the character but then is most of the time taken away by Sandler trying to be funny while looking dumb. That is really what his comedy has turned into. The most resent film that has bits and pieces of his original style is Pixel. There wasn't a whole lot of his original comedy in that film either though. If you don't know what I am talking about I would watch Happy Gilmore and Bill Madison. Those are two films that are historical and Adam Sandler is at the top of his game in both of those. Waterboy though, not so much. I think this film was better than Waterboy but Adam Sandler just wasn't that funny in either of them. I don't really mind his voice in either though. I know many people are tired of his voices and that is a main thing piling onto this films criticism. There is other talent in this film though like Kevin James. He does pretty well. He hasn't been in almost anything since Paul Blart Mall Cop 2. That film just wasn't that good either. Although he showed in this film he can still be funny. Julie Bowen didn't really add much to this movie. She was Adam Sandler's crush and she didn't really feel to well developed or acted. June Squibb was hilarious though. She was the main source of many of my laughs. She took everything that happened to Hubie in such a calm way. She was really the light of the film. Ray Liotta was also in this film. You could really tell he saw the contract and his eyes did the thinking for him. It felt like he didn't put any effort into his acting for this picture. He has been doing a bunch of these types of comedies. A couple of years ago he was even in Wild Hogs. He must be really desperate. There were also other actors in this film from many other Happy Madison movies like Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi, and Tim Meadows. They all just did fine. Although if they weren't in the movie I bet I would have felt the same way.Hubie Halloween is a film that turned out better than I thought but still proved Adam Sandler has lost much of his comedy over the years and will never top Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison.",Hubie Halloween

89,hoernkeem,"Hubie Halloween review (2020, Steven Brill) Another inane Sandler comedy rehashes Waterboy persona",2,10 March 2021,"Hubie Halloween (2020, Steven Brill)
Dropping in early October to slake the thirst of all those looking for new Halloween content comes this Adam Sandler comedy from Netflix. This winds up being par for the course for these latter day Sandler Netflix comedies which is essentially stupid and borderline annoying, but with not much original content out there you end up giving it a whirl cause you got nothing better to do. This stars Sandler in the lead role and matches him with his old paramour from 'Happy Gilmore' Julie Bowen who plays Violet Valentine who is the sweet object of Hubie's affection throughout. Steven Brill directs and he has pretty much made a career of directing Sandler films helming such projects as 'Little Nicky', 'Mr. Deeds' and 'The Do-Over' among others.
Hubie Dubois lives in Salem, MA and loves everything Halloween related. He is played much like a grown up Waterboy if you swap love of H2O for love of Halloween which also speaks to how Sandler's shtick has kind of run dry needing to essentially rehash characters. Despite being sweet and kind of low on the mental totem pole Hubie is a constant object for derision by much of the town. I think all the derision pointed at him is meant to be funny, but in this day and age it comes across as stupid, mean, unfunny and unnecessary. The only person outside of his mother, played by Jane Squibb, who seems to like and accept Hubie for who he is is Bowen's Violet Valentine and her children. She skews exactly the opposite and actually harbors a crush for Hubie that seems almost as nonsensical as the derision he receives only on the opposite end of the spectrum. After a new, odd neighbor played by Steve Buscemi appears and townspeople start mysteriously vanishing Hubie endeavors to discover what's going on uncovering much more than he bargained for over the course of events.
The entire narrative is a bit silly built on lackluster characters such that by the end you are really not too invested in how the story plays out or really what happens to the characters. It plays more like a children's movie although I don't think that is the intent. Of course in the end Hubie winds up triumphant for the most part and transforms from goat to hero without really doing anything. I feel like this movie fits into yet another paint by numbers Sandler film template and if you like that sort of thing then you will get a kick out of this, but by now his formula and comedy is so stale and uninspiring that I would prefer just to avoid it altogether and watch something more original and entertaining.

91,nebk,Worst Sandler Movie Ever,2,9 October 2020,"There are three problems with this movie. It has Adam Sandler in it, he actually wrote some of it and he is present in most of it. And as a result its an unfunny, unoriginal and terrible movie with the worst performance by Adam Sandler in his whole career. And the voice he uses might make you want to slam your head onto the nearest flat surface. He plays Hubie Dubois who seems to be the most unlikeable and hated person living in Salem and yet he is described as the nicest person by a girl he had a crush on in high school. He appears as somewhat mentally challenged and acts as a Haloween monitor who realises there is a monster roaming in his town on haloween night and people are disappearing.Overall there is not a single funny moment when Adam Sandler was onscreen. All the other actors were ok and clearly they did this because they know him and got easy money. Unfortunately whenever they were about to elevate the movie from being utter tripe Hubie shows up onscreen and ruins any humor. And his moronic gag with the thermos that is a flashlight/shovel/megaphone/soup container/yo-yo/grappling hook/etc gets old real quick. What really makes it worse is the fact that the man can clearly act in both dramatic and comedic roles but turning in a performance like this was intentional and insulting to viewers. There are some funny moments with Steve Buscemi, Kevin James and the other cast members as well as with the actress playing Hubie's mother and her tshirt selection. But this doesn't make a movie good. A 2.5/10 and that's generous.",Hubie Halloween
92,rmmil,Incredibly bad film,1,27 October 2020,"I thought Adam Sandler + Netflix Film couldn't sink much lower than previous entries...I was wrong.It's like Adam Sandler is doing ""What if the Waterboy lived in Salem?"", or something? Just the weirdest voice ever.Mix whatever Sandler is doing, add a dash of heavy-handed slapstick, and a couple piles of steaming dialogue from all those involved, and you have quite possibly the worst film of 2020.I knew Kenan Thompson is up for whatever cash grab he can get ahold of with zero thought of ""Is this in the best interests of my career?"" (see ""Bring the Funny""), but seeing people like Julie Bowen is a bit upsetting. She ""seemed"" to have some self respect?Flaming dumpster fire.",Hubie Halloween

94,theredsky,Hubie Halloween Review,3,16 October 2020,"This was a massive disappointment for me. I didn't think the trailer was good at all but I held out up but alas, it was no good. This was so disappointing to me because this is the film that comes out right after his amazing performance in Uncut Gems. The film's biggest issue is its script and characters. This script is so poorly written that it's embarrassing. None of the dialogue feels natural. Instead, it feels like an incredibly rough first draft. None of these characters are relatable at all because everyone is so rude and heartless. No normal town would treat one person this way. I know it's supposed to be a little unrealistic but it was too irritating not to mention. The performances here really aren't that good. Some of them were fine and harmless like Steve Buscemi but Adam Sandler and Kevin James were pretty terrible. Their performances felt so unnatural and Sandler's accent was just very obnoxious. The plot itself made no sense at all and felt very loosely put together. It felt as if they structured the story around the jokes which is something you really shouldn't do. Most of the jokes weren't that funny anyway. That's not to say all of them were bad because I did chuckle a few times but not enough to make me think this film was clever. The cinematography and music were fine. The film didn't look visually bad at all but it didn't do a whole lot that was interesting. If you're a fan of Sandler's style of comedy, then you might get something out of this. If not, definitely pass on it.",Hubie Halloween
95,MikeHunt1075,Sandler hits the all-time low.,2,7 October 2020,"Instead of Sandler playing the typical single guy with an anger streak but a heart of gold who meets a girl, falls in love with girl, loses girl then wins girl back, he's instead made a poor mans sequel to The Water Boy.Sandler has phoned this one in, and trying over the top cartoon law for gags and failing miserbly to try and lift the ducked projectiles gags from Animal House and driven it into the ground. Then slap a horrible beard on Kevin James and he's thankful someone is still dumb enough to give his has-been career a paycheck.This movie proves that Sandler just knows enough people now and has enough family to get any old garbage he wants to be made on film. Please, will someone tell Sandler to stop already and not attempt to write another movie unless it really feels like it should be made.This one feels like rehashed ideas already seen before, but not in a fun nostalgia way or revisit... it instead stinks of desperation.I'm not a Sandler hater btw... but his last few movies have been pretty bad. Just whatever can be thought up on the spot to do another film with a co-star that was a success in the past... but by God, this one just digs it's own grave and covers itself up. Its the worst Sandler film since Going Overboard.",Hubie Halloween

98,tresm87,Another slice of signature Sandler comfort comedy with a horror lite Halloween theme. Just know what you're ordering...,7,7 October 2020,"In 2020 you would think people would know what to expect from Adam Sandler's (effective yet slightly hated) brand of raunchy and quick witted humor. But still there are so many smug types that somehow ridiculously expect some huge swings into left field for his Netflix original comedies. Obviously he's shown incredible versatility in his career but people should be able to gauge by the trailer and it being part of his Netflix contract that these aren't Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, or Uncut Gems. Know what you're getting. The snobs that hate Sandler are the types that would go into an Applebee's and expect a five star meal.This film sticks to classic Sandler formulas which isn't an issue imo. A humble basic story about an odd yet lovable main character that finds himself in the middle of a series of hilarious problems. Along the way he runs into other weird zany characters and maybe a few villains that join in on or his hilarious antics. The actors are the usual Sandler friends that he's had in other films.Overall its just a nice comfort Halloween themed Sandler comedy that shouldn't be taken so seriously by snobby critics that can't grasp the point of these films after all these years. Throw it on and forget about the world.",Hubie Halloween
99,KOOLAIDBRO,When I went to the restroom I didn't pause it because why?,3,10 October 2020,"Edit: I changed this from a 1 into a 3 after watching Thunder Force.Adam Sandler still doing that stupid voice, overdramatic falls, over the top screaming, farts, and vomit jokes in 2020. Kevin James who I've never thought was funny actually didn't drive me insane. He wasn't bad. Sandler... Oh BOY! I see many people shutting it off fast because his stupid accent. He has the girl that's way too hot and smart with a heart of gold love interest. I don't know why I turned it on, but I thought maybe..... JUST MAYBE he'll be funny again. I wanted to shut it off but my 7 year old nephew that I was babysitting was in a trance watching it and when I stopped it he lost his mind so..... My brother and his sister in law will feel this pain countless times in the future. I laughed a few times that had nothing at all to with Sandler that saved this from being the 7th circle of hell. Like all the news women being Harley Quinn was humorous. It's predictable Sandler movie where the town idiot gets bullied by everyone, gets the girl and saves the day. I could put a spoiler, but really.... Who cares. Like you wouldn't know this was going to happen in a happy Madison film. I can't wait for my brother to call me or send an angry text because that's what this movie will do to anyone over the age of 7.",Hubie Halloween

115,Sunsphxsuns,HUBIE DELIVERS THE PERFECT HALLOWEEN PUNCH!,10,27 September 2021,"OMG some of the negative reviews this terrific film has garnered could drive a person crazy. So, I'm going to come out fighting!Here you go: Adam Sandler is the new Charlie Chaplin of our era. His self-deprecating, physical and often sophomoric style of humor reminds me so much of the great Chaplin, and why fans adored his ""silent era"" comedies. Audiences then related to Chaplin much like we now relate to Sandler. He is ""Everyman"" (and ""Everywoman"" in the 2011 comedy Jack and Jill). Sandler isn't trying to make the next Citizen Kane. His genius is in understanding his targeted audience and assuring that they will be entertained with his own unrestrained brand of humor.In this beautifully staged salute to all that is Halloween, Sandler plays the role of the likable Hubie Dubios, who, is pretty much verbally or physically abused by everyone in Salem Massachusetts. You read that right: The same Salem, where, in 1692, 19 women were accused of being ""witches"" and were executed by hanging or sent to prison.Thankfully, Hubie Halloween doesn't resurrect any of those dark and terrible events, but instead, focuses on the pure celebration and charm of Halloween. The film has a splendid cast, a ton of cameos, plenty of laughs, and I dare say it may someday become a Halloween Classic for future generations to enjoy. It's a Sandler film guaranteed to leave you absolutely hoping there will be a HH sequel in 2022.",Hubie Halloween

119,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A Saturday Morning Cartoon Halloween Special from Adam Sandler; Silly Fun For The Family,6,16 October 2020,"Hubie Halloween, Adam Sandler's latest Netflix comedy, plays like a Halloween special of a wacky Saturday morning cartoon done in live-action.Adam Sandler is Hubie Dubois, the village idiot of a modern-day Salem who speaks in a mumbly cartoon voice. Hubie is a passionate fan of the Halloween tradition and volunteers himself as a community guide, much to the ridicule of Salem townsfolk who perpetually bully Hubie. When Dubie finds himself in the midst of a murder case on Halloween night, it is up to him to save Halloween.I grew up on Adam Sandler movies and even more so, on his comedy albums. Sandler always digs for the silliest base form of stupidity to craft a joke out of and whenever his gags land, it feels like we both got away with something. He got my laugh and I feel certain freedom from social norms having laughed at something so ridiculously stupid. As much as I like to dissect comedy and define what is intellectually humorous and what isn't, there is a joy in being shaken out of that mindset and just enjoying a pure laugh.While this is not to the classic level of Happy Gilmore or The Wedding Singer, I chuckled throughout Hubie Halloween and had two major belly laughs. The first was a gag from Maya Rudolph and Tim Meadows as a married couple bickering in a car. The second was a voice gag done by a surprise celebrity cameo, who I won't reveal here. It's more to the level of The Waterboy and I was pleasantly entertained in a low-key kind of way.Hubie's mumbly cartoon voice may prove annoying to some, and it is a case of ""take it or leave it"" as Adam Sandler commits to it for the entire runtime. If it's unbearably grating for you ten minutes in, this probably isn't going to entertain you.Hubie Halloween will fare best with ten to twelve-year-olds or the kid who laughs at everything because they just simply like to laugh and do not buy into the concept of cheap laughs, slapstick, and pratfalls as poor taste. I can see it being a fun one-time watch for a family to build a Halloween mood as we move closer to the end of October. The parents may just see their kids laughing at the silliness and join in.",Hubie Halloween

It reminded me of movies like Ernest Scared Stupid, which we watch every year. If you don't care for movies like that, with that kind of humor then this may not be for you.For parents like me that are always on the look out for fun family/kid safe options that are also enjoyable for the adults on Halloween this is a great addition.

Happy Gilmore was a film of its time, the 90's and worked well. Hubie Halloween is an 'Adam Sandler' movie and by default will float between daft and irritating... only it doesn't.So the good and the bad:
It's a feel good movie. Hubie Dubois is a great person - if the world had more people like this in it would be a much better place.Adam Sandler's voice choice for Hubie is irritating. Then again, Adams usual voice is irritating too, cancelling out my previous negative.It's an entertaining story. I put this on as background TV and ended up sitting down to watch it properly.It's a good fun themed Halloween movie for all ages.It reminded me of The 'Burbs (1989), another 'odd next door neighbour' film (and highly recommended even for its age)So all in all, this is a good film if you go in without big expectations.",Hubie Halloween

I expected another okay comedy and that's what I got.I recently read an article on Sandler which states he keeps on phoning it in which is true. Sandler talks in a goofy accent here so you can't always understand him but I understood him for the most part. The cast is fine including Kevin James whom I don't like and Julie Bowen who worked with Sandler on Happy Gilmore. No spoilers but there's another Happy Gilmore connection.The plot is weak and absurd which I expected. This movie is just a bunch of jokes mainly Hubie being mocked and scared. No spoilers but there's a kissing scene so cringey it's funny. There are a few plot elements that doesn't make sense.Overall, Hubie Halloween is entertaining but forgettable.

Sandler has been playing a mixture of comedic dupes and dramatic lethargic introverts & it just seems like he did the wrong type for this to be a comedy. I simply didn't find it funny, nor did it seem like they were really trying to be funny. Rather it seems tragic, just with a goofy face thrown at you.",Hubie Halloween
144,fensser,confusing,1,18 October 2020,"With all the silliness this seems to be aimed at kids, but they included many sexual references. Either it's a children's movie or an adults' movie you can't have it both ways. Gross.

145,celtic451-228-782719,FAST PACED PERFECTION!,10,25 October 2020,This movie was amazing! Fast paced funny all the way! It was great to see Adam's character from Water Boy back. One funny moment and line after another - I couldn't stop laughing - my stomach hurt at the end of the movie! And it had a great message too. It was great to see George Wallace in this. And Tim Meadows and Maya were a perfect comedy match. And of course always great to see Rob and Steven in Adam's movies. This will definitely be a movie we watch every Halloween in our household from now on. A new Halloween Classic! Must see!,Hubie Halloween

147,its-me6611,I had a smile on my face throughout the film,9,9 October 2020,"9/10Such a wholesome film. It left a warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart. If you are looking for a good laugh and nothing too serious, go for it.Hubie is a looser by everyone's standard who is a scaredy pants and does goofy things. But his mother and certain person knows that Hubie is the kindest person in Salem, the unofficial capital of Halloween. Every Halloween Hubie works to maintain safety standards in Salem and every year the town's people pull pranks on him. But this year the danger is real. Will Hubie be able to save the Halloween?The story is simple and is told in a simple manner. The cinematography is great. The film looks good. Production value is great too. And the acting is top notch. All the characters are likable even the mean ones.The best part of Hubie Halloween (2020) is the comedy. I had a smile on my face throughout the film. There are lots of laugh out loud moments. It is a feel good film and I felt incredible after watching the film. As long as you know what you are getting into this is an incredibly rewarding watch.",Hubie Halloween

The all-star cast was quite a bonus, and you could tell they really had fun making this.",Hubie Halloween
152,fandomfatale,Great Halloween Ambience and Heartwarming Story,8,9 October 2020,"I'm glad to have another Halloween-themed movie I'll enjoy rewatching at this time year to get me in the holiday mood. I laughed out loud plenty of times and had fun seeing so many familiar celebrities in small roles. The end put a big smile on my face. I loved all the surprising abilities of the thermos and the running gag of people throwing stuff at him, even when he seemed to be alone in the forest. ""Marco"" ""Weirdo""I agree the voice was annoying but I stopped noticing it.Rant:I can't believe all the 1-star reviews - ""Worst movie ever"". So dramatic. If you really think this is the worst movie ever then you obviously haven't seen very many movies - or taken any chances on different or independent movies which can be very hit or miss - so why should I care about your opinion since you don't know what you're talking about and have no perspective. When you clicked on an Adam Sandler Netflix comedy you should have known what you were in for and if you're hard to please then watch the trailer first so you can make a more informed decision about whether or not this is a movie for you. No, it's not a piece of brilliant filmmaking, I gave it a high rating because I personally liked it a lot, but if you thought it was a *1* then in my opinion you've got no business rating movies because you're not capable of a level-headed or proportional review.",Hubie Halloween

156,blazesuncaster,Annoying but sweet,6,12 October 2020,"Yes, without a doubt this is a terrible movie with terrible writing, directing, and editing but it's not supposed to be good, I can just tell the actors had an amazing time with the kids making this film. Adams voice was super annoying in the beginning but I got used to it. I would say that this is a sweet film that's taking us back to Grown-ups days. Not as good, but we have the original cast. Again, this movie is bad but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because it was just fun to watch and it was kinda funny in some parts.",Hubie Halloween
157,lukas-ingel,Charming and festive,10,17 October 2020,"By all means, this movie has its flaws. I'll be the first (actually far from) to point out that Adam Sandler's voice is TOO much of a change to the point where it becomes distracting and does more bad than good. This movie is so incredibly cheesy too, and simple and at points cringeworthy.
But they know.
What's really bringing an experience here, is the self-awareness, the self-ironic, meta charm and the constant celebrative festiveness. The characters are all recognisable and warm, and the intend behind it all is so pure, that I find it hard to reject at all. Just bring some popcorns and sit back and chill, it's definitely got some nice twists, turns and chuckles in between some of the predictability and corniness. Even surprised me good a few times.My actual rating would be 7/10 for its enjoyability and strong character though lacking in several places, but 5.2 general rating here on IMDb? Looks like some of you got that mean spirit this movie tries to preach away, haha. Learn the lesson.",Hubie Halloween

160,theotherblonde,It's a really stupid funny adam sandler with a nice message and alot of laughs,6,8 November 2020,It's basically like every dumb adam sandler movie.It is pretty funny in a gross twelve year boy way .You feel so bad for hubie and his friends who are singled out for being too sensitive and nice. You want things to work out for them .Also there is a haunted spectre of a witch hung in 1692 exacting revenge and making mean people disappear and possibly a werewolf on the loose that keeps it interesting.,Hubie Halloween
161,krazysoon,Hubie The Waterboy,2,11 October 2020,"I felt like Adam Sandler was just playing a grown version of the Waterboy without the anger issues. Yes the voice is annoying....I think I laughed at Kevin James more than Adam Sandler. How do you go from Uncut Gems to this? Only he knows..I can't take him as a serious actor when he's releasing films like this....The film is mediocre at best. A lot of well known celebrities make cameo appearances. His two daughters and wife even play in the film. You can obviously tell who his daughters are. It has everything you would expect from a bad movie. Watch it because halloween is coming up but skip it otherwise. If you're watching it with children, they do make jokes about male body parts...pretty tasteless actually.",Hubie Halloween

This movie has all the usual characters we have all come to love and expect, though it would have been nice to see some of his original friends as well.

It's just bad. What really really really starts to grate on your nerves on this one is the terrible acting from Sandler. He does this weird mumbly voice for Hubie (a contrived, poorly thought out and badly acted town-need type character). Most of the time you can't understand what he's saying. Try it if you must but it's just awful.",Hubie Halloween
168,jwcstorage,No redeeming qualities,1,20 November 2020,"After the mediocre to me Uncut Gems, where Sandlers acting was basically ""Dont do any 'funny' accents, dont try to be 'funny', dont adlib, follow the script, act like a human"", I had hoped the Sand Man might lean into something a bit more realistic.WOW WAS I WRONG!!!Seeing that this had a decent average review, I was thinking that maybe, juuuuust maybe Sandler would have realized that his stupid, unrealistic accents (what IS his accent supposed to even BE??? Its not a Massachusetts accent, thats for sure!) and pandering to the lowest levels of 'humor' that Hubie Halloween might trip into a decent halloween movie.Again, big nope.Once more, we have Sandler playing a mentally deficient person with a speaking handicap (grade A humor there) who is widely despised by his whole town, who knows and detests him. It seems like this may be a bit of self-reflection here on his part, as he grew from a once-talented comedian into a hack who churns out garbage movies.As the title suggests, this film has zero redeeming qualities.
It looks fine, but having a film 'look good' is not difficult in 2020.
A score exists... I guess? It adds nothing.
The acting is basically ""all of the people Adam Sandler puts in his movies: THE MOVIE"".
Sandlers acting is like rubbing your open eyes vigorously with course sandpaper.After the acclaim Adam Sandler got post-Uncut Gems, I had hoped to see him try to actually ""act"" again, instead of act like an ass.
Unfortunately, he chose the latter.AVOID LIKE THE COVID!!!",Hubie Halloween

170,skylermoore,Good Bad Movie,4,12 October 2020,This movie was one of those really bad movies that was trying to be bad but also trying to take itself too seriously. The first half was solid but the second half was just a crash and burn. Lots of Cameos and references to other Adam Sandler movies are honestly what carries this. A 3/10 would be more accurate but I'll give it a point for at least keeping me a little interested with an okayish twist at the end and all of those references and Cameos.,Hubie Halloween

It could have been way better if the protagonist wasn't that dumb guy. That the only thing I have against this movie.
True some jokes are not great but it's part of the movie, so I accepted them.

183,G-Joshua-Benjamin,It is what it is.,5,13 October 2020,"I was excited to check this movie out. I liked another of his Net Flix movies. Here are my thoughts.First, the voice he was doing, ruined the movie. It was just, annoying. He seems to be the voice he used in Billy Madison. Which was fun back then. But, it seems like he is above that now.They had fun stuff. Like when he would ride his bike and stuff would be thrown at him to knock him off and or hurt him. But, they just used the gag far to many times. I mean, I think at one point, there was a sword thrown. I get it, it was crazy over the top stuff. I laughed. But, it was just to much.There were so many things that just existed for no reason other than to exist. I mean, a bunch of stuff went nowhere.The way his lady friend talked about him, it was like, meant to sound fake. Which is odd.I liked how so many people, who have worked together in the past or are always a part of one another's movies were together. It brought back so many memories of when my dad, brother and I would go see Sandler movies in the late 90s. It was a great feeling.The lady that played the girl he liked, I think that lady is some sort of cyborg. She does not look like she aged at all. It was amazing. hahaI am glad I watched the movie. I did laugh. Actually, I would watch it again. It seemed like everyone was just having fun. But, I just can't give it better than a 5.",Hubie Halloween

But that's upto you to decide, it's not a big deal if you see this as what it is, a goofy Halloween movie!

Hey we meet again bad Sandler!This is not the worst film. J&J is. The jokes aren't funny in this. I guess people expected it when they decide to watch.The acting, hmm let's skip this.The plot was not bad for a comedy.

204,cockadoody73,"Enjoyable, but.....",5,25 October 2020,"I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler, but I do like quite a few of his movies - Grown Ups for example.
This movie is a standard Sandler job, get together a few of his friends, behave in an over the top - almost cartoonish - way and entertain the audience. He does that here.
The story is ok, very predictable.
Hubie, a grown man who still lives with his Mother (her thrift store t-shirts are hilarious) and is the town joke. He's abused by young and old alike, bullied and ridiculed (The throwing things at him whilst he rides is bike is funny the first time, it gets old by the third, fourth and fifth...) on a daily basis.
He loves Halloween, and is the descendant of a woman killed in the Salam Witch Trials.
The story is pretty much secondary to Sandler's showboating. The cast comes together fine, they do the job and it's pretty funny to watch.But....
Sandler's ridiculous habit of twisting his mouth and doing that ridiculous voice that he finds so hilarious is cringeworthy.
Kevin James' disillusionment that he is some kind of heartthrob is confusing. He seems to find himself way more attractive and entertaining than anyone else does, and pretty much plays the same character in everything he does.",Hubie Halloween

210,jonandshellie,"Not a masterpiece, but standard Happy Madison fare",6,10 October 2020,"I read about 150 to 200 user reviews for this before I watched it. When it comes to movies, I feel theres no better guage of how truly good a movie is than to get a concensus on it from the IMDB users. Movie critic reviews are never something I take into account because they are basically a bunch of art house cinema snobs who try to compare every movie to Citizen Kane or Apocalypse Now. I like to get the pulse of the real people before investing my time in a movie.That brings us to Hubie Halloween, the latest Netflix offering from Adam Sandler. I must say, I watched it opposite my better judgment based on the generally poor reviews I read. Mostly unendearing to the viewers seemed to be his accent and the unnecessary need for it. I can't say I'm a fan of it, as I feel its Sandlers childish way of demonstrating a member of low I.Q. in our society and that can be borderline offensive to anyone who knows or has raised a child with mental disability. That being said, I watched it anyway at the behest of my children.From moment one, you knew this wasn't going to win any awards. It was a standard Happy Madison movie with the usual cast of hooligans (including a startlingly ""old"" looking Steve Buscemi). I can't say it wasn't nice seeing Adam Sandler and Julie Bowen back together on screen again after 25 years and I loved the small cameo from Ben Stiller as his sadistic orderly character from Happy Gilmore, handlebar mustache and all. Would've loved a Shooter McGavin appearance at some point, but that didn't happen. Irregardless, when the movie was over I found myself having laughed at it more often than I cringed at the ludicrousness of it. Most importantly however, my kids enjoyed it and I think that was the target audience anyway and they nailed it. In the end, this was just a funny family Halloween film and it deserves the respect its due. It was dumb fun and worth the 102 minutes to watch it.",Hubie Halloween

It's a silly Adam Sandler comedy that follows a very specific formula that we've all come to know during Sandler's career but at least Hubie Halloween actually has a nice message about bullying woven into the story. Sandler doesn't always get it right with his movies as Jack and Jill and That's My Boy really standout as awful pieces of work and this was nowhere near that level of terrible as some are suggesting. It's a lighthearted movie that provides you with an escape where you don't have to focus too much to follow the story and the comedy is basic but effective.,Hubie Halloween

I don't get the relatively positive and good reviews for this mess. Its so boring and poorly written, acted, and executed. Makes a movie like ""Joe Dirt"" seem like Citizen Kane in comparison.

It had all the elements that spoke to me.Goofy, funny, naive, goodie 2 shoe main character whose bullied by the whole town without truly realising it.Funny storyline with a few very unexpected moments that had me bursting into laughter.Amazing cast like always :)I won't reveal much more - other than if you truly enjoy Adam Sandler's old movies, then you're in for a treat.

There will definitely be at least one moment where you laugh out loud.Story is actually pretty decent. First the movie does a good job of introducing the characters and building Hubie's character. As halloween comes the mystery begins along with the best moments of the movie.Although, there were moments where you just think this is silly and they haven't tried hard enough with the story.

Just look at Tim Meadow's horrible wig and Kevin James's obviously fake beard, and you'll realize this is all for fun...until the end, where the serious lesson comes in as only Sandler knows how to do it. It's a funny, touching moment that really moves you if you care about how you treat people.I loved it and will make it an annual watch each Halloween.",Hubie Halloween

Once you get over Sandler's voice (which isn't that bad) and the fact that the townspeople are awful lol, this movie actually is a decent story. It surprised me a few times and though it took a bit to get going, I found myself cracking up at some of the jokes.

The acting in many scenes is cringe-inducing and Hubie's character is borderline offensive, but how could you not laugh at all the Harley Quinn costumes, the way he screams at literally everything scary, and his mom's shirts. Additionally, there are so many riffs and references to both horror classics, and Sandler faves that make this dumb movie seem almost smart at times?This film ain't winning any awards anytime soon, but it might just be a good candidate for some all-ages family fun, to keep the kids laughing at the slapstick, and the parents laughing at the more adult humor that goes right over the littles' heads.",Hubie Halloween

It was funny, silly, wholesome, with so many realistic underlying themes throughout. I got to see some of my child-hood favorite characters. Who were in the older Sandler movies. We also meet some new characters as well! I may be biased, since I grew up on SNL, and Sandler's films in general, but this is his best ""Silly"" work since Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison era. I went in knowing I would get the goofy. But came out feeling satisfied, happy, and warm. A perfect Autumn favorite. As a bonus, my 10 year old son thinks Adam is hilarious, and has already rewatched it multiple times. He is still a little too young to introduce him to my Sandler favorites.

I've watched Adam Sandler movies since Billy Madison came out in 1995. I believe this is the first movie with Adam Sandler and Julie Bowen since Happy Gilmore (1996) and I really enjoyed seeing them work together again after over 20 years. There are some Easter eggs hidden in this movie that connect some of Adams older movies, it was a nice stroll down memory lane when I noticed them, I don't wanna spoil them for you so see if you can spot them!
If you're looking for an Oscar nominated picture possibility then this movie isn't for you.

Adam Sandler is playing his typical stupid, farting and puking character that turns out to be the hero against all the odds.
Kevin James is fun to watch and honestly my favorite part about the entire film.
The jokes that you're about to see (or have seen) are the same ones that keep Sandlers movies alive. It's gross and you don't need your brain at all. The plot is not very original but it manages to be charming and entertaining most of the time.
It's not a masterpiece and I'm almost 100% sure I won't remember most of it by next week tuesday but if you need to kill 90 minutes, it's fine.6/10: Short, stupid, unoriginal but certainly a treat for Sandler and Crew fans.

I particularly loved Steve's and Rob's comeback, rejoining Adam in reunion of their good ol' entertaining times together!Along with the above, many of the retired and current SNL cast members (among others) join together here for a celebration of Halloween time, which puts a twist on what we are all familiar with during this holiday, yet also adds new excitement for the viewer.I laughed a lot and was reminded of how wonderful Halloween is! Something we won't be able to celebrate the same way in 2020 (due to Covid), except on our TV screens, through this wonderful expression of these actors' celebratory time together.This is a must-watch for every hardcore Halloween fan! This will easily become a new Halloween comedy classic to look forward to watching for many Halloweens to come!Thank you, Adam Sandler and team - for bringing Halloween to US this year. Although we can't leave the house to trick-or-treat this year, we wouldn't even have to if we could - with the treat this film delivers at a much-needed time!Recommended: For a fun Halloween watch!-E from ""'Ontariano', far up north... in Canada"" (a.k.a.

The ONLY thing I enjoyed was the very short lived scenes of Salem and the mothers t shirts, that's it.

372,nottaproblemuk,What were people expecting?,7,14 October 2020,"It really baffles me when people who claim to be Adam Sandler fans, give poor reviews of his movies, claiming to be 'disappointed'. What were you expecting from an Adam Sandler Halloween flick? A coming-of-age comedy drama? A complex character study?I give this a 7/10 because I judged it exactly how it should be judged. If all Adam Sandler's comedy movies were judged on whether or not they compare to the truly great films of our time, then 90% of them would score 1/10. At a push. But films shouldn't be judged that way - they should be judged on whether or not they achieved what they were trying to achieve.This brings me onto comedy movies - and I mean comedy movies. Not 'dramedies' or other genuinely serious, dramatic films with some small comedic elements - but 100%, straight down the line, out-and-out comedy movies. These types of films shouldn't be judged in the same way we judge dramatic cinema.The brand of comedy Adam Sandler uses most of the time, is 'slapstick comedy'. It's not to everyone's taste, nor is it the most nuanced form of comedy - but it undoubtedly has it's place in cinema and TV, and it's served Mr Sandler well. Very well, in fact. Disappointed 'fans' of his who are giving this film poor reviews probably aren't, in fact, fans at all.This brings me onto 'Hubie Halloween'. A textbook Adam Sandler slapstick comedy flick, that follows a middle-aged man as he's subjected to mockery and bullying by the locals in his town, as a result of his nerdy appearance, and his obsession with health and safety - particularly when Halloween comes around. This year however, mystery ensues as Herbie investigates a number of sinister events that take place on the night of October 31st.Of all the comedy films in Adam Sandler's back catalogue, Hubie Halloween probably borrows more from 'Murder Mystery' than any other. If 'Murder Mystery' was a spoofy, slapstick take on the classic, Agatha Christie-esque 'whodunnit' genre, then 'Hubie Halloween' is very much a light hearted spoof of the 'comedy horror' style that was famously re-popularised by the 'Scary Movie' franchise - the difference being that any spoofing in 'Hubie Halloween' is of the films of Adam Sandler himself. One of the many Easter Eggs coming in the opening scene of the film - which, without spoiling it, will be sure to please fans of Happy Gilmore!This isn't one of Sandler's best comedy films, but it certainly isn't one of his worst either. Whilst Hubie Halloween won't have you 'belly-laughing' from beginning to end, there is enough solid material throughout to keep audiences amused. It's a fun, lighthearted piece of cinema that has exactly what it's supposed to have - jokes, slapstick comedy, silliness, wackiness, lightheartedness, and a plot that is interesting and captivating enough to keep us - the audience - interested.On this basis, I give Hubie Halloween a solid 7/10. It's silly, and it knows its silly. It's wacky, and it knows it's wacky. It achieves exactly what it's trying to achieve, and that's good enough for me. Bravo!",Hubie Halloween
373,olmosssanchez,It's the hallowen de hubie as bad as they say?,7,13 October 2020,"A year ago Adam Sandler said that if they didn't nominate him as a oscar I'd make a very bad movie to take revenge.

I can say that this film is quietly more of a classic Adam Sandler film. With stupid jokes that we, Adam Sandler fans, always like (in case you say you don't like Adam Sandler ... you're lying), a great cast and a satisfying storyline.

When a killer escapes from the local asylum, no one pays attention to Hubie's warnings, so you immediately know something is going to go terribly wrong.

It's a streaming, Netflix 8, not big blockbuster pay $50 at the theater 8. Anyone who gives it a bad review clearly doesn't know much about today's films or Sandler's work.

When I pushed it back down, it made an audible sound when snapping back into place, causing a wave of nausea to overcome me.Over the next few days, blood pooled underneath my toenail, causing an immense amount of pain. In order to relieve the pain by releasing the pressure, I used a 1/16 drill bit to make a small hole in my toenail, through which blood started spraying.

Sandler's Hubie is a strange but ultimately lovable creation, and all the other characters were very likable.There is a very big twist at the end, which I really didn't see coming, and I very much loved this film, and while it certainly won't be everyone's cup of Halloween tea, for me it does for Halloween what ""A Christmas Story"" does for Christmas.

411,Kevin0202,Is it worth seeing? YES,4,28 October 2020,"The Good 👍The truth is that we found very few good things about these films and some are very far-fetched but they are worth naming them.
The first thing to highlight is the performances since the cast of this film is full of actors / actresses with a very good trajectory and fully knowing what they do (Adam Sandler, Noah Schnapp, Steve Buscemi, Ray Liotta, ETC) all played as their papers perfectly.The production design is very good, we do not say perfect but the Halloween setting was done super well, and with the help of the good lighting that it has they make you get fully into the film, the little CGI that there is is perfectly done, and the Good comic moments in the film are not many, but the few that did well were worth it and make you get a smile or two, and finally we really liked the message that this film gives to the youngest children.The Bad 👎We are going to start by saying the worst that were the badly made plans and especially the bad cuts that from one cut to another jump talking about one thing to another or doing
whatever else they did, for that part they handled it terrible.The story they tell is sooo cliché and absurd (Although absurdities for comedies are good but here it plays against them) the script is also lousy, anyone who knows something minimal about the subject can do much better and half or much more of the comic moments are very typical and some come to shame others.The makeup production was very bad in several aspects, whether it was adding wigs that did not look at all real or beards among other things that clearly seemed very fictional.",Hubie Halloween

I have seen this movie 2 times (once when it came out and once this week) and I liked it more the second time. I think this is one of the best Adam Sandler movies I have ever seen. I know a lot of people don't care for Adam but you have to remember it's a comedy and it's only goal is to make you laugh. I think Hubie is a funny character who is so easy to root for. I also like how Julie Bowen is in the movie because I love Modern Family. It also helps I'm from Massachusetts and don't live to far from Salem. I know this review probably didn't help but let me just say if your thinking about watching it... WATCH IT because you will like it. I rate it 8/10,Hubie Halloween

Rob Schneider has had a terrible face lift
Julie Bowen should be praying for Modern Family reunion shows

At some point, they seem like just socially awkward people, but then they act like they don't understand the concept of the funeral, it's insulting, to say the least.+Weirdly, some of the gags work.

Ordinarily, this would be a bad thing, but given how terrible the dialogue spoken by every other character is, this may actually be a blessing.
In truth, I didn't get further than about thirty minutes before I had to turn this off. Mean-spirited, tedious, unfunny - just some of the words I would use here. I just couldn't get my head around what Sandler was doing with the main character - is he supposed to have learning difficulties? Is this meant to be funny?
Indeed, it was very hard to tell if this *was* a comedy. One example of a 'joke' early on: Sandler's character breaks wind. That's it. No reason, no context, he just does. What???

Unfortunately for Adam Sandler, it's now 2020 and comedy has evolved.To overplay a character with mental issues who gets bullied by everyone is bad and it's just not funny. If there isn't anything in a comedy to make you laugh, then at least some story would be good right? Well guess what? You don't get a story either, it's just nonsensical.Lastly, What's with the voice and silly mouth movements Adam?

They are so basic as far as a story-line goes, that you know exactly what's gonna happen from the first 15 seconds of the trailer. Sandler has done the same three characters for the last 30 years, the bumbling idiot, (this movie, water boy and little Niicky etc), the sarcastic man child with anger issues, (Happy Gilmore, Anger Management, Billy Madison, Big Daddy and the list goes on and on), and the mentally unstable (Punch Drunk Love, Reign over Me etc) he needs to please stop, for the love of god just STOP!!!",Hubie Halloween

We know to expect ridiculous humor, silly childish jokes, and fairly predictable storylines from him and that's exactly what we got. I loved all of the Halloween aspects and set designs, the storyline was cute, my kids laughed a lot and my husband and I laughed a few times too. A lot of people are ragging on Sandler's voice, which sure is kind of annoying, but it's far from making the movie unwatchable for me.

It's entertainment at it's best. He keeps 4 things in mind while developing these kind of movies.

Sandler's movies regularly get panned by the critics and I suspect that's because he doesn't follow typical, progressive movie-making that we're seeing in Hollywood today. That's fine with me. Every time I watch an Adam Sandler movie, I'm left with the good feels and uplifted attitude.Adam once again plays an outcast who lives with his mom; it's very reminiscent of the Waterboy. His character, Hubie, is a kind man with a heart of gold who only wants his hometown of Salem to have a happy and safe Halloween and is abused because of his eccentricity.However, the movie is heartwarming and hilarious; it features regulars from Sandler's circle and they don't disappoint. I loved Julie Bowen as his love interest; it's nice to see Adam being paired with someone age appropriate for a romance line.

I also found the plot to be a bit strange because of the fact that everyone hates Hubie.But I have to say, the cast was quite good and the horror element mixed with the comedy element worked in this film.

It had a spooky Halloween theme indeed, but not the humour I was seeking for, it was rather cliche. Adam Sandler's voice was extremely frustrating throughout the film.
The plot wasn't so interesting, the ending was weird, I sketched 3 smiles throughout the whole movie.

Does his voice acting even matters? The movie has incredible childhood actors that I grew up on, even the comedian actors. They're incredible. Maybe Hubie's character is suppose to show something?

For that reason I really enjoyed it. I thought there were plenty of funny parts, but then again if you don't like the classic ""Adam Sandler"" style of humor don't expect anything different from this one.

This changes the pace for Halloween movies and its refreshing to see. A great cast, who doesn't want Adam Sandler and Kevin James in the same movie. I say this is one of the best Adam Sandler Movies. So many callbacks and it reminds me of water boy. There might be some cringy scenes but the rest of the movie is filled with fun and a mystery. I am rating it a 10 so I can raise the score but I think it deserves a 7. Hope you enjoy the movie.",Hubie Halloween

The story was okay but the jokes weren't the best. However, I was kind of interested in seeing what he could do next with the thermos.

I just couldn't watch it after a couple of minutes, I fast forwarded to some different scenes and it was just pathetically outdated. Was this on purpose because of Uncut Gems?

With a cast like this you truly could've thought it's gonna be great but the whole point of the movie is to be bad, and I think that all of these critics aren't looking at it that way. Adam Sandler wasn't trying to make a Shawshank Redemption, a Godfather or whatever he was making a bad movie on purpose because Uncut Gems got snubbed at the Oscars apparently. The movie as a whole was alright, it was funny sometimes but most of the time I would've just gave it a sour smile for the jokes. I think making Hubie a lovable character didn't really work out until the end, most of the time I felt bad for him but not really. This movie really didn't have outstanding performances, Adam Sandler was probably the best actor after Steve Buscemi and that's saying something. No particular character was funny, except for when Shaq showed up, that was a good laugh. Everything considered this movie wasn't bad, it had a good plot twist, it had.. alright characters, sometimes funny jokes, average writing but it really shouldn't be looked like this since it was made to be bad but if it were to be reviewed as a real movie, these would be my thoughts. 5/10, probably won't watch again.
Oh and also may I add I came into this movie with low expectations, no matter that it was hugely hyped up during the year, but I got something I was expecting, kind of?",Hubie Halloween
602,ginojsinacore,Hubies so so Halloween,5,7 October 2020,"This happy Madison movie was definitely partial lived up to its expectations from each way, it was bad and good in its different ways. Adams Sandler's performance in his goofy voice and persona is not far off from his usual performance but the voice threw off the character a little much and made the character in some cases cringey throughout the movie.
The usual appearances from happy Madison actors was very enjoyable with Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider and Kevin James all playing big rolls. There was a abundance of Disney child actors such as Peyton list, Karan bran, China Anne McLain, Bradley Steven perry, Kelli burgland, and Paris Berlec. It was a nice little change up from the usual cast, although certain actors such as Bradley and Kelli didn't get anymore then 1 minute of screen time with about 2 lines.
Overall the movies plot didn't make sense through the middle and End of the film and it was kind of everywhere and at one part unsure who the main antagonist or Villain is supposed to be and seemed like the movie was definitely targeted for ages 8-20 for kids and teens and individuals who love happy Madison's film. Wasn't a terrible film, the cast was super enjoyable and the movie is definitely worth a watch!",Hubie Halloween

Most jokes were very quick to delivery, so I basically got those; or were way too cringy and lingering to watch, so I just ignored those. The only thing for me is that with the 'Star' power Sandler had at his disposal, (and I don't just mean genius acting and improve troop from legendary film and TV, but amazing writers as well) he really created a low ceiling for comedy. In my opinion, mu h more could have been done with these tools. All-in-all I would call this movie a predictable, enjoyable, Star-filled, seasonal, Sandler-medy with added censorship of 'safe-speak' resulting from current political environment; great for cooking or doing something else while watching, and shouldn't be taken critically; Then can be a lot of fun.

652,cosmality,Adam Sandler in his worst movie ever,3,9 October 2020,"Another in a long list of disappointing recent movies. In a continuing attempt to find something worth watching in the last few years I was hopeful here.I like Halloween, and typically I have liked Adam Sandler. I couldn't agree more with the other reviews that his stupid voice almost ruined the movie immediately. It is so obvious fake, and often hard to understand, ruining the whole movie before it starts. Tried to fight past that to see some really gross stuff that wasn't funny and clearly just looking for lazy laughs.Usually in these movies there is a good turning point where things start to go better for the main character, until ultimately the movie finishes with a conclusion making you feel like the main character ""won"".In this movie, everyone loses. The performers, the director, and certainly the audience. This isn't a spoiler, just a fact.",Hubie Halloween
653,drstooch,This movie exceeded my expectations!,8,16 October 2020,I went in to this one with low expectations and was very surprised! This is one of Adam Sandlers better movies of the decade. Fun Halloween movie with lots of familiar faces.,Hubie Halloween

I watched the trailer after finishing the film and it showed every scene I laughed at as well as some surprising moments I didn't see coming.

There were also quite a lot of people saying this film was racist and mean? I dunno how you can class the last name Hennessey as racist and not just cliche, or timeless gags like the main character being kicked into a grave by bullies as too mean that it ruins a movie. kinda seems a bit whiny to me, I was genuinely reading those and thinking 'oh boo hoo'. I'm 34 and my wife and I watched it with our six kids, aged from 6 to 17, and we all loved it. us older ones laughed at the more adult jokes while my youngest daughter loved the slapstick comedy of Adam Sandler getting scared by puppets and falling over. I don't see where this '11 year old comedy' stuff is coming from, the radio station scene and the pig owners had me genuinely dying. All around a great movie, especially coming from Adam Sandler. I don't like much from the guy but the Grown Ups movies were some of my favorite comedies of all time, and this movie seems a lot like those, even using a lot of the secondary actors from Grown Ups 2 like Steve Buschemi and Tim Meadows.Also a cool easter egg my eldest daughter picked up on, in Hubie Halloween Ben Stiller plays a mental hospital attendant named Hal, and in Happy Gilmore Stiller played a nursing home attendant named Hal, and both characters have the same moustache.",Hubie Halloween

I am a bit dissatisfied with the movie here's why...
Adam Sandler's character was not far from funny, it fit him very well. The voice he did throughout made me have to keep on the CC so I can understand him.Hubie was the main character and I feel like every other character got only 10 min of screen time in the whole show. Some cast members were barely even shown.The plot could have been 1000% better if they added a spin off on the psych war escapee with making them a huge part in the film.The message in the movie was amazing and showed how kindness is amazing and if everyone is kind we will love ourselves.Overall, I believe with everything the director was given, this movie could have been the best movie ever, but it was hard to follow.",Hubie Halloween
735,arianaseward,Laughed the entire time,9,11 October 2020,"This movie encompasses the meaning of slapstick comedy.

How do you go from a well renowned actor/film producer to this straight garbage??? I did better talent shows with zero budget in middle school than this trash movie. I'm literally mad my boyfriend made me watch it for longer than 10mins and now I'm seriously questioning our relationship. We're in the middle of a pandemic, health crisis, bs presidential election, and social movement and this is what you have to offer? This is how you use your platform?? I'm disgusted to say the least.

a lot. It's one of his better movies. Has a great cast. Super cliche which is what makes it great.

A place where his love interest is too attractive for him, and no one really cares about making a good movie.I strained to watch 70% of this mess because a friend worked on it; I couldn't watch the rest. I started to feel bad for Hubie, but as the movie ""progressed"" (if you could call choppy storytelling progression) I ended up understanding why everyone hated him; then I hated him. His speech impediment makes him nearly impossible to understand-it takes you out of the movie. Hubie is annoying, not like Kramer from Seinfeld; more like ""harass you at a gas station for some change annoying"". His thermos gimmick isn't funny, and he looks like a  predator. The development between him and his love interest is non-exsistent. His jokes fall flat, but he continues them anyway; trying to convince you to laugh. This movie isn't funny. I laughed at least twice, and felt angry for the rest of it. Just watch something else, no one cared about this movie. The acting is half hearted, the writing is terrible, and it has no tone-it goes from ""horror"" to low brow ""burp & fart comedy"" at the flick of a switch.

It won't look any different to what it usually looks like, but deep down, I know its sore and non-weight bearing. Why? Well I hurt it at work. But like my foot, I can look at modern Sandrer film, and think ""why yes! It looks exactly as it always has!"" until the weight and stress of actually consuming the film applies itself and I feel the sharp and slicing distain of a stress fracture ripple through my soul. Unlike Adam my dear boy, I have hope and certainty that my foot will once again get back to full working capacity.The central character Hubie, as the title would imply he would be, is experiencing halloween. This character, much like the unwashed cheddar betwix the cracks of my toes, stinks like the bowels of a whale. It refuses to allow other features of import, such as other characters, the story or even setting to fully develop. And much like my non-funtioning foot, continues to insist upon itself and thinks it deserves much more positive attention than it realises. It's a stereotypical, played out, boring and, to my dismay, innevitable aspect of the world we live in.My distain for Hubie may insinuate however that, to refer to rest of the movie as the rest of my body, might be a 10/10 masterpiece, chiseled from stone and directed by the love child of Uwe Boll and some other famous director of whom I know not the name, but as for those who know me, would know I refer to the rest of my body, and in turn, the movie, as a 2/10 greece pile of carbage held up on the finest stonework of calcium slowly crumbling to its demise as the rest of the sagging flesh and revolvting looks slowly pierces the very core of its being. What I mean to say is, the rest of the movie ain't great either.The movie really does come down to a modern day formulaic structure of: haha adam sandrer character is weird, sees girl who will be unable to deny the rock hard attraction of his throbbing rod, proceed to face plant into the ground, attempt to pursuade the rest of the garbage cast that his character is not crazy whilst they do unfunny things and pretend that shitting on Adam sandrer and saying they're aroused is funny. Mind you, both of these things are funny, outside of a Happy Maddison production. When the rest of the cast finally move their way through the schlock of a story, drink up the last of the dryest of settings, they all come to flock around Adam's fantastic and magnificent dong, and realise that his character was correct in the end, before a cheesy ending (not in the good way) and a montage of ""hehe adam sandrer character moments"" plays while the credits rollTLDR; 2/10 movie, formulaic, boring, skippable, a true modern day Happy Madison production that keeps Adam's potential down due to his lack of trying to bring out the amazing actor he genuinely is when he puts in the effort. Do not watch, even if suffering from ""my foot is unwalkable, and I need to binge Netflix until it heals""-itis.",Hubie Halloween
779,haylieslater,A Spooky Night In Salem/ Review of Hubie Halloween,10,20 September 2021,"A Spooky Night In Salem:
Review of Hubie Halloween
Would you like to ""monitor"" the town, to keep it safe from werewolves, ""Saw-like pig mask"" monsters, and crazy on the loose mothers, with just your thermos? Hubie Halloween (2020) by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler is a story about Hubie Dubious on October 31st in the spooky town of Salem, Massachusetts. As he ""monitors"" the town to keep the children safe from the horrors of the full moon. Hubie is a young adult that plays a big role throughout the film and faces challenges such as getting bullied and beat down constantly, yet he is the nicest person around. Although Hubie Halloween is a comedy and not-so-serious film, it brings up subjects and discussion matter that the audience can relate to with the help of passionate acting, strong character development, and vivid special effects.This film is appealing for the character development because of the powerful growth of the main character as he overcomes situations and conquers them. For example, he gets beat down by people, throwing things at him, mocking him with nicknames (Pubie). He keeps his eye on the prize of solving the mystery of why people are disappearing. Hubie never gives up on the mysteries. There is no doubt that Hubie will save the day, protect the town, and get the girl. Additionally, Violet Valentine is another prime compassionate character, and she is very anxious about telling Hubie about her feelings. Violet, toward the end of the film, finally expresses her affection to Hubie; however, this scene does not bring to his attention that the love of his life likes him back. Through the taunting and the never-ending bullying, she sticks right by his side. However, the character development reveals a strong ""theme"", that ""true bravery is being kind even to those who are being cruel to you. ""Even though there are many ways that the characters develop through the film, the obstacles that Hubie overcomes in the movie help viewers connect with him through his troubles.The acting is interesting because fans will see some new faces in this film with Adam Sandler. For example, the role he plays is a not-so-bright character, who talks funny, and doesn't know how to act right in certain situations. He gets beat down through the film for just trying to keep the town safe. He is the ""hero"" that rides on his bicycle, escapes from flaming spears and even toilet paper. Sandler plays this role charmingly. Adam Sandler has played similar roles like (Water Boy) and gets bullied for being different. Additionally, Julie Bowen is another audience favorite; she plays the role of Violet Valentine. She is a single mother that takes care of two adopted children; however, she works continuous hours to support her little family. In fact, she has been Hubie's crush since high school. She has always been the nicest girl in town. Bowen plays this role very impeccably; throughout the movie, she adores Hubie for his heart.The special effects are very compelling because of the comical jump scares in this film. For example, Hubie rides his bicycle around town, while the vicious kids taunt him, the camera had to be in front of the bike throughout the scene while keeping the image clear. The effects are strangely appealing as if you were right there with the characters in the film. Some fans may say that it is very unique in the way the camera caught the right angles when in motion. Additionally, the small jump scares are delightfully horrifying. To clarify, in the scene in the pumpkin patch, Hubie encounters his mysterious new neighbor that may be the werewolf. It seems that he is only lit up by the moon; however, the work crew works with ""balloon lights and lifts."" This allows the movie to reveal the reality realism as if the viewers were there with Hubie. The comedy and the excitement have the fans waiting for more Adam Sandler-based films like Hubie Halloween.Hubie Halloween is a film that can be appreciated by children and adults. The passionate acting, strong character development, and vivid special effects, and the best of Adam Sandler will keep the viewers crawling back for more. Nevertheless, the werewolves and ""Ghostface"" kids leave a spooky but realistic connection with the audience. If you love family-fun films that will leave the whole family in smiles, then I believe you should watch Hubie Halloween. Even though it may have some scary scenes, it is an enthralling piece of work. Hubie Halloween teaches us that it is ok to be who we are and to never give up on ourselves, and that is a lesson anyone can learn from in any walk of life.",Hubie Halloween
780,sav-90537,Enjoyable,7,4 October 2021,"Hubie Halloween is a film about a volunteer safety monitor who is the target of his community. Hubie Dubois is always pranked, having things thrown at him, and not taken seriously. This Halloween, Hubie is following his suspicious neighbor he suspects to be a werewolf and witnesses the people who pranked him get kidnapped. He tries to notify the police, but because of his constant miscellaneous reporting he was ignored and avoided. Hubie follows his leads that there is a werewolf eating the people of his town. The town starts to realize the missing people and point the blame on Hubie, since he was there at the time of each abduction. Hubie finds the sheriff to help him locate the killer only to find the killer to be in his own home. Hubie is left with the decision to have revenge or save the ones who have bullied him throughout his life.This film was a fun comedy and mystery that was true to its genre. The film gave unexpected twists that keeps the audience engaged and giggling. Hubie's admirable character shows no matter the actions of others, he cares for what is right and the safety of the community. Hubie does not change regardless of the ridicule he faces throughout his life. Hubie's romantic relationship with Violet Valentine shows that selfless gestures do not go unnoticed and that they are appreciated. Although it is fun to play pranks with someone who is so easily scared, there is boundaries that are crossed. It is hard watching a loved one with good intentions face hateful actions and influences them to get involved.If you are a fan of movies starring Adam Sandler, I think you will like Hubie Halloween. Sandler uses a different voice than his regular voice when playing as Hubie Dubois which he has done before in his past movies. This film is interesting to see because of the other actors that have appeared in movies with Adam Sandler before. I do not think this film is meant to scare you; I think it keeps you entertained which is the point of a good movie. Rather than use horror to explain Halloween, the directors chose to focus on the sense of community. I rate this a 7/10 because it meets the expectations of a good feature Halloween film.",Hubie Halloween

Sadly, Hubie Halloween isn't in the same league; it's far from his best work. The plot is thin, boring; the jokes all fall flat; and Sandler's half-baked character with an unconvincing speech impediment left me feeling like I never want to risk another two hours in Sandlers' company again.

This movie HAD potential, but Sandler destroys it by doing that stupid Waterboy voice throughout the entire. freaking. movie. It's horrible. Often times, you can't even understand him. I wanted to turn it off after about 15 minutes, but my husband wanted to finish it. It never improved.

With that in mind I was excited... but no... it is practically impossible to understand what Adam Sandler is saying throughout the whole film.. it is pretty much a garbage kids film at best. The only saving grace is Steve Buscemi... who has max 3 min screen time ..

800,reg_mza,Take the Water Boy and add a Halloween theme,3,16 October 2020,"Basically the same quirky character as The Water Boy, or Canteen Boy from SNL, add in a Halloween theme with some childish spookiness to it, and that's what you got with this movie. It's not really that funny and is just another movie where Sandler can get his friends and former/current SNL personalities involved to produce something that ultimately he gets paid for either way as executive producer and actor.Included are:
Kevin James just hanging on to his career however he can at this point.
Same goes for Rob Schneider, a regular cameo staple in all Sandler movies.
Gratuitous involvement by Steve Buscemi, Maya Rudolph, and Tim Meadows.
A smattering of Kenan Thompson, Colin Quinn, Blake Clarke, Shaq, and Dan Patrick.Throw in the mom from Modern Family, Julie Bowen, and the cast has recognizable faces but the rest of the story is straight trash. Jokes that land are in the form of sarcastic snipes at Hubie and Hubie right back, but the rest is flat and boring.Lastly, a lot of people are asking, why the voice and if you have to ask that, then you'd have to ask it for movies like The Water Boy, Little Nicky, and Don't Mess With The Zohan. It's a personal choice to deviate the character from his normal characters. He tends to do this more with socially maladjusted characters or characters that are introverted or rejects. If you don't know by now then you have only started watching Sandler movies.Bottomline, if you're an avid Sandler fan, you'll watch it for better or worse. You may hate this trash, but you'll watch it anyway. If you're not a fan, then you'll absolutely hate this and turn it off after a few minutes.",Hubie Halloween

The story flow was overall okay imho, and I didn't see that ending coming! I think the supporting cast did a great job. However, the main character is poorly written and executed, we never get to see why does the main character behave the way he does (you'd think that one would stop being scared of silly pranks at some point). At the same time the amount of grown ups willing to bully a person who most likely isn't entirely neurotypical is even more confusing and takes away from the plot.",Hubie Halloween

He is such a nice person, basically a living saint, but everyone is mean to him. In an era of postmodern comedy, where years old movies like 21 jumpstreet commented on how everyone is pretty much against bullying, I expected that it would be revealed that Hubie must have done something terrible to the town, by mistake. But no, they are just all a-holes.In the final scenes, there's a big speech about how everyone shouldn't be mean to him, and how the real strength is enduring the bullying, and I couldn't believe that by the end of the speech, no one commented at how generic and pointless that speech was. It's not necessarily about the message, it's about how generically it was delivered. It was so bad, I expected it to be part of the joke.I have my share of guilty pleasure trash spoof movies. I understand that you shouldn't expect Adam Sandler to defecate out quality movies. But let me tell you this: I have thoroughly enjoyed the Disaster Movie, and even I find this unfunny.I always jump in to defend Adam Sandler, not because I particularly enjoy his movies, but because I thought that he doesn't deserve the hate.

824,karami_csizmadia,Watch this with an open mind!,10,10 October 2020,"If you are like me and work with special needs kids you may be put off by Sandler once again playing a mentally impaired man. Yet there is something different in this role he has played, the goofy things you would expect from an Adam Sandler film exists here in Hubie Halloween but there is more behind it. Hubert Dubois is a mentally challenged man living with his mother in Salem Massachusetts, he has a bright personality and a crush on a sweet mom of three two of which are adopted named Violet Valentine. He lives for Haloween and lights up with joy at the excitement of his annual job of providing safety to his community.
The people don't see from his point of view... without giving away too much of the film know this, Hubie is treated like garbage, assaulted, bullied, and not respected.
But he seems to be unphased as a man with special needs, he doesn't see the hatred as a treat to himself he continues to remain pure and devoted to the people... no matter what.
I give this ten out of ten because I cried... I cried because this man is so special and people don't want to see it because it exposes their own insecurities.
People with mental disabilities are challenged like Hubie, they are challenged by the insensitivities of a select few in their community.
So I ask to see beyond your opinion of an ""Adam Sandler"" film and notice the lessons to be learned, A mother's love can know no boundaries, be kind no matter what, fall in love with yourself, and let who you are shine out over those who deserve it or even those who do not.
Thanks for the inspiration!!",Hubie Halloween

872,wastedtears-22726,"You're hating to hate, but why!!",9,24 October 2020,"I loved this movie. Don't get me wrong, Adam sandler is a hit or miss, but this was brilliant! Brought you right back to the nostalgia of his films. If you don't like Sandler, just don't watch it. It's that easy. For the rest of you who like dumb humor sometimes, I laughed to hard at things that shouldn't have been funny coming from anyone else <3",Hubie Halloween

874,jacktherhycer,Another example of Adam's new genre,8,8 October 2020,"A emotional, hearthwarming comedy. Inspirational final scene , like a lesson to 2020's people. Adam Sandler continues comedic mystery thriller genre",Hubie Halloween

879,mr-quija-1,"This was hard to watch. Stop making ""Comedy"" films Adam Sandler, it's over.",1,7 October 2020,"No more please. You have a good legacy when it comes to comedy films, but it's over my friend. This movie is cringeworthy, the lines are recycled, the actors are recycled and frankly movies like this are killing their careers as well. Enough is enough, stop it.This was hard to watch, the child actors in this movie were horrible as well, can you start casting people with some actual talent instead of the producers kids?I could of written a better movie out of my....No more, you are a good actor but comedy is no longer your thing.",Hubie Halloween
880,thabyrd,Happy Madison,1,10 October 2020,Just as bad as you knew it would be. The only way I feel any of these happy Madison films would be tolerable is if Chris Farley was still here to be in them.,Hubie Halloween
881,kenzieewens,Hilarious Comfort Movie,10,23 August 2021,"I love this movie so much. It's one of those movies where you can watch it 10 times and still laugh. Adam Sandler's characters are always a blast. Yeah, it may not be ""realistic"" but did any of us actually expect that? If you did, you're a fool. This is such a great halloween movie and if the humor isn't your cup of tea then it's just not.",Hubie Halloween
882,obarton-55230,Absolutely terrible,1,13 October 2020,I'm usually a fan of Adam Sandler films but this is literally one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I was amazed at how bad it was.,Hubie Halloween

IDK how much they paid for all those famous actors... but frankly speaking it's not worth it",Hubie Halloween
885,drichards-31953,Unwatchable,1,10 October 2020,"I've never before felt the need to write a review on IMDB. I can find some value in most things: even some of the worst films are so bad they are fun to watch. However, if this warning saves even one person from losing the time from their life it takes to watch this mess, then it's worth it. The whole thing is a vehicle to go from ""loser thinks he'll never get the girl"" to ""loser is now a winner and gets the girl"". There's no other plot. Sure, this is the case in many other films, but there's nothing here in the way of jokes or good performances ..or anything.. to make that journey interesting in the least. I liked Happy Gilmore. I'm not a Sandler hater. But this thing is an utter mess. I feel bad for the cast. This is unwatchable.",Hubie Halloween

Pop some popcorn and just enjoy the silly Stuff with yourself or the family.",Hubie Halloween
888,davytop,"SANDLER, YOU BETRAYED US!!!",3,14 October 2020,"You promised to give us the worst movie ever if the Academy snubbed you for your role in Uncut Gems. Instead you gave us a painfully mediocre comedy that felt like a waste of time.
I'm so disappointed and angry.",Hubie Halloween

890,thewordman,Like Getting Last Year's Leftover Candy Dropped In Your Sack,2,26 October 2020,"We got about halfway through it and could take no more. Although the film brings a variety if visually engaging Halloween cliches, it all tastes as stale as last year's tootsie rolls. It might be a feel-good outing for the eight-to-twelve-year-old set, but definitely not for anyone who is too old to go trick-or-treating.",Hubie Halloween
