0,SnoopyStyle,functional start,6,15 January 2020,"Angry villagers attack Gomez and Morticia's wedding. The family escape to the new world where they settle in a dark mansion up on a hill. Margaux Needler is a disapproving neighbor who has her own show selling her perfectly planned community. Wednesday befriends Margaux's daughter Parker who tells her about junior high school. Wednesday decides to abandon home school for the public school.This is obviously trying to tap into the Hotel Transylvania fandom as well as the nostalgia. This does remind me of Addams Family Values in one way. In both movies, Wednesday is the most interesting character. She has the most personal growth and her adventures are the most fish out of water. The movie goes overboard with Margaux. It would be nice to have more Parker with Wednesday. The family remains the funniest when they are forced to adapt to the regular world. There is not enough of that. When Wednesday starts dressing girly, Morticia could get more laughs by dressing the same to get in touch with her rebelling daughter. This is a functional start but it needs to go somewhere new if the franchise continues.",The Addams Family
1,claudio_carvalho,Funny and Entertaining,6,20 January 2020,"Gomes and Morticia Addams move to a derelict mansion in New Jersey surrounded by a marsh and hidden by a fog in the top of a mountain to raise a family. Thirteen years later, Gomes is teaching his son Pugslay the saber tradition of the Addams family while Wednesday is questioning her mother about the world outside the mansion gate. Meanwhile a community is raised by Margaux Needler, who is the responsible for the sales of the house, and the marsh is drained. When she sees the old mansion on the neighborhood, she decides to get rid of the Addams Family.""The Addams Family"" is a funny and entertaining movie for the family. The plot is silly but works in an afternoon. The residents acting like puppets manipulated by fake news and the teenage rebellion are the best moments. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Família Addams"" (""The Addams Family"")",The Addams Family

The story centered on Wednesday and Pugsly. The theme is diversity. Being different is okay. The best part of the feature was Lurch's choice on the pipe organ. They obtained a lot of top named actors for voices, I just wish the story had been a little better.",The Addams Family
3,kosmasp,Animated ... evil,7,5 October 2021,"The Addams Family ... it's been a while since I saw the live Action movie. And I think I only saw the first movie and not the show or anything else. Still the music is quite iconic ... and it gets introduced here in a very funny way too.The Addams Family may be morbid, but never too scary for the viewer ... as crazy as it may sound ... like a house yelling at you to get out. Of course for the Addams Family this is music to their ears. But as they are not something anyone would call normal .. they have issues. The moment we meet them ... and later on too. Btw. The latter part of the movie, where mayhem ensues is the one that is the most fun of it all (imho).A nice little movie that apparently was succesful enough to warrant an upcoming sequel ... great voice/acting talent too.",The Addams Family
4,lee_eisenberg,always be yourself,5,16 October 2019,"I didn't go into this new version of ""The Addams Family"" expecting anything profound. I figured that it was some nice silly entertainment (with an obviously spooky bent) and I was right. Much like how the live-action versions addressed the fact that the Addamses were seen as weird for being different but were a perfectly decent family, this one features them resisting pressure from a developer/reality star who wants to create a monoculture (and has a thing for both surveillance and over-the-top hairdos).Nothing special, but enjoyable.",The Addams Family
5,paul_haakonsen,This was actually very enjoyable...,6,3 January 2020,"Sure, I grew up watching The Addams Family on both movies and cartoons, so the concept of this odd family was nothing new to me. But for an animated ""The Addams Family"" movie that came to see the light in late 2019, I must admit that I wasn't really overly sold on the idea.But still, I sat down with the family to watch it, as my 9 year old son wanted to watch it.Turns out that this animated movie was actually rather entertaining. The story was straight forward, if not actually simplistic in terms of what you'd expect for such a movie. But it worked out well enough, especially since this was more of a character driven animated movie, than it was a story driven one.The CGI animation was really good. I was amazed with what the CGI team mustered to do here. There were so many details in all the scenes, even small things that have no impact on the story, but just add atmosphere to the entire movie. That was definitely something that pulled the movie in the right direction.I loved the character design. And again, the CGI team really worked their magic with the characters, just as they did with the setting and atmosphere. But not only was the character designs good, I also enjoyed the art style quite a lot. It was very much in the essence of The Addams Family, and you might throw in some classic Tim Burton inspiration as well, because it was there.Now, the characters would not work without proper voice acting, since this was an animated movie. And yes, they had opted for a great ensemble of casted performers to do the various roles and voices throughout the movie. This was also working well in favor of the movie.This 2019 ""The Addams Family"" CGI animated movie is definitely well worth watching, regardless of if you are familiar with the family or not.My rating of this movie is a solid six out of ten stars.",The Addams Family
6,BandSAboutMovies,Fun film,6,31 December 2019,"Conrad Vernon started his career as a storyboard artist on Cool World but may be best known as creating and voicing the Gingerbread Man from the Shrek movies. He also co-directed Sausage Party before starting work on this reboot of Addams, who you may remember from the Charles Addams newspaper strips (which started all the way back in 1938), the 1964-1966 TV series or the three films made in the 1990's, The Addams Family, Addams Family Values and the direct-to-video Addams Family Reunion.There's a cute origin story at the beginning of this film, as Gomez (Oscar Issac from the new Star Wars films) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) escape the old country thanks to help from Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll). As they travel to New Jersey, they soon meet Lurch (Vernon). In truth, they move to Westfield, as that's where creator Charles Addams grew up.As we move forward a few years, we meet their children, Wednesday (Chloë Grace Moretz) and Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard, who must have the Richard Moll in the 80's deal to be in nearly every movie that comes out). Pugsley is about to enact the ritual of the Mazurka, which is a sword dancing exhibition that proves that he is man enough to defend his family. It's kind of like the Addams version of a bar mitzvah.Meanwhile, reality TV host Margaux Needler (Allison Janney) is creating a town called Assimilation down the hill from the Addams mansion and wants to rid her perfect town of the family.The message here is that everyone should be unique, which is nice for kids to hear, and that even strange people like the Addams can be a family that loves one another.There's plenty of fun voice talent in this, like Snoop Dogg as Cousin Itt, Bette Midler as Grandmama and Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara as Morticia's parents.I really enjoyed how the look of this film appears more like the actual comic strip than the TV show, although the end, where the cast appears in the original credits, is a delight.",The Addams Family
7,studioAT,A nice introduction to The Addams Family,5,1 November 2019,"I knew of 'The Addams Family', but had never seen the series/films, so this was my introduction to them.I had low expectations going in, but came out having enjoyed it.There's some good vocal performances from the cast, and the story had some nice themes of acceptance, loyalty etc.It's not up there with Disney/Pixar level of animation, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and will now watch the older live action ones.",The Addams Family
8,view_and_review,Fairly Entertaining,6,4 October 2021,"After getting a couple of live action versions of ""The Addams Family'' in the 90's (which I loved), we get an animated version. Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) is still crazy in love with Morticia (voiced by Charlize Theron). Wednesday (voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz) is still a monotone harbinger of doom and Pugsley (voiced by Finn Wolfhard) is still the frequent object of Wednesday's experiments to get rid of him.This movie could be considered The Addams Family origin story. It begins when Gomez and Morticia are just getting married and also being ran out of town by an angry mob. They find Lurch (voiced by Conrad Vernon) and also find an old asylum at the top of a spooky hill to be their new digs. For them it was perfect. Life was spooktacular for them for thirteen years until a ""Flip or Flop"" type TV show led by a woman named Margaux Needler (voiced by Allison Janney) decided to renovate the town below the Addamses. This new town of Assimilation was everything antithetical to the Addams: it was clean, colorful, cheery, and full of Stepford people. A town such as this would not have a good value while being under the shadow of the Addams Family's dark derelict lair.While Margaux plotted to make the Addams conform, Wednesday was going through a rebellious stage and even put a barrett in her hair, and Pugsley was having a difficult time learning the Marsuka (an Addams Family sword dance that was a right of passage). The Addams were facing a crisis of sorts. ""The Addams Family"" was mildly amusing and fairly entertaining. I don't think there needed to be an animated version, but that's Hollywood now: animate what was once live action and make live action what was once animated.",The Addams Family
9,cherold,"has its moments, but too few",5,17 January 2020,"This version of The Addams Family takes its look from the original Charles Addams and it characters and many gags from the TV series, but it doesn't seem to entirely understand either, resulting in a movie of broad, often juvenile humor without a consistent vision.The original cartoons were essentially about odd people with odd tastes. The TV series built on this, creating a fully fleshed-out family of cheerful iconoclasts. The Addams Family was a bunch of friendly people completely aware of how little they fit into their suburban American world. The people they met seemed odd, and they never thought they themselves might be the odd ones.The movie starts with the Addamses facing torch-wielding villagers. They are hunted and hated and dream of a peaceful life. So a series whose main joke was that its characters thought they were the only normal ones because a story about people who know they are the freaks.This wouldn't be a fatal flaw if the movie was funnier. There are genuinely hilarious moments, like the frog-dissection scene, but in between hilarity there are all these familiar gags unlikely to appeal to anyone older than twelve.This is unfortunate, because a distinguishing feature of the cartoons, the TV series, and the live-action film is they all were the product of smart writing. Making this movie the first dopey Addams Family production I've encountered.Perfectly watchable, really, if you have the patience for it, but not the Addams I know and love.",The Addams Family
10,Edvis-1997,6,6,25 December 2019,"Well I really wanted to see this movie because it was highly promoted but the best parts are in trailer and nothing left in movie. So really average, kind of disappointed, too childish.",The Addams Family
11,Bored_Dragon,"""I'm not locked here with you; you're locked in here with me.""",6,8 December 2019,"Today we took the kid to the movies to see the latest adaptation of the Addams Family, which I love very much. For the sake of the child, we had to watch a version synchronized in Serbian, which itself is quite a nuisance. To the animated characters, the voices are borrowed by the pretty famous cast, but instead of their, I suppose, at least good, if not great performances, as usual, we got the lousy domestic synchronization. It is sad that we cannot make at least a little effort to act that synchronization properly. So, the acting I cannot judge. Dialogues and witty replicas ... I don't know if that was well translated or in the rank of usually bad domestic subtitles, and even if they did this part properly, the word games and the original charm are certainly lost in translation, so I can't judge that neither. The animation is good, although it's also debatable since we watched the movie in 3D, but I didn't particularly like the look of the main characters. They all have those stupid toothpicks for limbs and huge heads, Morticia is not seductive as she should be, they turned Gomez into a fat freak, Pugsley resembles a gargoyle, and Wednesday, Fester and some others can barely pass as human beings. Instead of an eccentric but sympathetic and primarily human family, the Addamses are portrayed as disfigured semi-humans. Only Lurch made a somewhat positive impression with his appearance and manner in which we synchronized him. And finally the story. I can not say it's bad. It's fun and keeps attention. But it is totally unoriginal and has been seen so many times (""Hotel Transylvania"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" ...) that even my eight-year-old was like - meh, it's nothing special. All in all, if you are not a fan of the original series from the sixties and have not watched too many films, you could easily like this, but for me, who has watched thousands upon thousands of movies and the original Addamses were one of my favorite series, this is mediocre at best.6/10",The Addams Family

13,John6Daniels,They are back,6,12 February 2021,"Even in animation people are enslaved to the media. The believe what they read.The Addams family is an iCONIC and gold family, show, movie and series. From the 50s to present day the Addams family has been around for a long time entertaining me.I adore the Addams family because it doesn't take its self seriously, and they are spontaneously funny. It's violent without violence. It's Dark with some light.Now they return in 2019.The story is a kind of an origin story of the Addams Family. Wednesday is curious about ""what's on the other side"" and gets to experience it.
It's a duality, polarity movie. What happens when 2 opposite sides collide?Other than that it Subliminally references the surveillance state. There are other subliminal messages that only a few people will notice.The animation is okay. It's No Toys Story. Its not bad though.The characters each have somewhat of the same personality of old. Exception to Pugsley. Pugsley is indifferent compared to past reincarnations.Colour feel: black and brightOverall a good movie. It's nothing like past versions still it's a good movie. Is it made for children? Despite subliminal racial quotes and fruits if the child has tough skin and is smart then he can handle this product. If they can't then they have a condition.I Would have given it a 9 but the Addams Family integrating with everyone was a slap in the face.
I fumbled at 8, 7 and will settle for 6 because the ending stabs a rainbow into the Addams Family... I mean that literally. A sharp Rainbow stabs the Addams Family.Verdict: imagine girl scouts can now have a Sunday Afternoon picnic with the Addams Family. Maybe even go to the spa and a baseball game.",The Addams Family
14,briancham1994,Half-baked and empty,4,9 April 2021,"This was quite a disappointment compared to the previous Addams Family films. The characters were depicted as pale pastiches of their former selves without much charm, just macabre slapstick. Not to mention they are very out of character at times! The three storylines - Wednesday trying to fit in, Pugsley failing at the Mazurka and the property developer - were set up with a lot of promise but went just about nowhere. Each has their own desires conflicting with their family and the community around them, but it is all resolved too neatly, story elements are glossed over too quickly (e.g. The school bullies or the secret cameras) and there is too much filler (e.g. Introducing all the extended relatives).",The Addams Family
15,cruise01,Unimpressive animation and a boring reboot.,4,22 January 2020,"The Addams Family (2 out of 5 stars).The Addams Family is a boring and dull reboot to the Addams Family movies. The gothic and supernatural family is back in this animated feature. Although, it really lacked the spirit of the original movie. From a lackluster script and direction. Surely, kids may enjoy this movie more than adults. The humor and jokes are old and feeling outdated in this movie.The plot follows Gomez and Morticia getting married and chased away from their homeland from villagers. They find an abandoned asylum in New Jersey where they settle in too. They meet Lurch, an escaped mental patient (who looks more like Frankenstein). As years go by, their son Pugsley is preparing for a family coming of age tradition. While Wednesday, their daughter wants to experience the world. Away from there sheltered house. Which there town is growing with new neighbors. And a reality tv host Margaux, who is trying to build a perfect neighborhood and wants to rid of that old house.The plot is decent about a story of a family trying to keep to themselves. Wednesday is wanting to explore. And meets a friend who is tired of hiding who she wants to be with her lifestyle. It is a cute and charming story. The script and direction lacked in making any of these interesting characters fun to watch. They are all dull and forgettable. The animation is dreadfully boring. It is no Tim Burton's style. The directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan failed to make their film stick out.Overall, The Addams Family is a bad film. The reboot on turning it into an animation failed terribly. With dull animation. Boring and outdated humor. The script and direction lacked in making this film worth watching.",The Addams Family
16,filipemanuelneto,Look who decided to go back to the movies!,9,5 March 2020,"This animated film resurrects the Addams Family to the cinema, which is a recurring appearance in the seventh art ... and thank goodness! They are fun in all their weirdness and bizarre ways. In this film, which begins with the wedding of Gomez and Mortícia and the arrival of the new couple to their decadent mansion in the middle of nowhere, the family's peaceful unhappiness will be disturbed by the construction of a model urbanization on a neighboring lot. Is this how the Addams will adapt and integrate into society? I really liked the movie, but I've been a fan of the Addams for years, so my view of things can be a little distorted by my personal taste.Designed for young people and adults, it presents a very simple and easy to anticipate story, which makes the entire film undermined by predictability. But as much of the film is based on the strength and charisma of the main characters, who are limited, in part, to being themselves, this turns out not to be a problem. The voice actors' work is quite good, and we can find, among them, names as well known as Charlize Theron, Snoop Dogg and Chloë Grace Moretz. The soundtrack fulfills her role very well. With regard to the sound part of the film, I especially liked the scene where Lurch plays, on the organ, the main theme of the old series, but there are several moments when the silent butler offers us with his artistic and musical gifts.I think the film is visually beautiful, with good drawings, appealing light and color, reproducing in a very perfect way the house, the clothes and the characters we get used to seeing. Of course, most, if not all, of the work is CGI animation, and of the best quality. The gloomy atmosphere of the house has been reproduced to the smallest detail and radically contrasts with the ""mainstream"" style of the new neighborhood below. The film explored all these contrasts to the fullest, with good results.The most original and strangest family ever did not return to the cinema, if I am not mistaken, since the distant ""Addams Family Values"" of 1993. It was a long absence! But it was worth the wait. This film, carefully done well, is truly worth it.",The Addams Family
17,Rectangular_businessman,"Not bad, but it could have been better",5,22 December 2020,"There are a couple of clever moments there and there, and there were also some interesting plot points that could have been more properly developed, but the overall result is just so-so, both from a technical and narrative standpoint.The jokes were a mixed bag, some of them worked, but the large majority of them (Especially those focused on ""topical"" issues) were just meh.The ""Everybody Hurts"" sequence was awful, the same kind of forced sentimental garbage the Addams movies from the 90s would have mocked.",The Addams Family
18,matthewssilverhammer,Ooky October Fun,7,18 October 2019,"We seem to be at a plateau with Hollywood animation. While Pixar and Disney continue to push the boundaries of what computer-based animation can do both technically and artistically, most have figured out how to do the bare minimum to get in theaters.
Normally this would be considered purely lazy and cheap, and I suppose it is. However, this inability, or lack of desire, to advance the technical part of animation has caused some of them to lean more into the style and messaging. This was the case with Abominable (though unsuccessful, to me) and is also true for The Addams Family. The main difference is, with its ""dead""-pan wordplay and gentle ribbing of American norms peppering its kind and content characters, Addams is just much more up-my-alley than the faux-sincerity in most kid's films.
We find our fiendish friends learning how to assimilate into their new neighborhood, only to experience some predictable pushback from the status quo. There's no real surprise of any kind in the plotting, and some of the voice-casting is less-than inspired (Kroll as Fester is especially obnoxious).
However, there's some unexpected social critiques here laying a foundation for the spooky schtick. Government-wielded assimilation, media manipulation, comparison-based capitalism; it's all clearly there if you want it from your children's entertainment.
In the end, this is just a great property. Unlike the Hotel Transylvania franchise, the Addams aren't just playing around the edges of the macabre, but are diving right in. The family at the center clearly care for each other, but because of the darkness in the humor, it rarely comes off as saccharine, providing inoffensive yet entertaining October fun that'll really make you screa-um.",The Addams Family

20,southdavid,Thanks For Nothing Thing.,4,28 October 2019,"Seemingly unpopular since its announcement, an animated version of ""The Addams Family"" seems like it should have been a relatively easy to adapt - but its insipid, unfunny writing hamstrings the movie from get go.Looking for somewhere free of rioting mobs to start their family Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac) and his new wife Morticia (Charlize Theron) settle on an abandoned asylum in New Jersey. Years later, and now with two children, Wednesday (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) - the Addams' macabre ideal is threatened by the redevelopment of the local town by Home Styling Guru Margaux (Allison Janney).Positives first, it looks OK. I actually quite like the look of the principle characters - though I acknowledge that this has been divisive for some other people. The rest of the CGI is fine, it's very much in the style of ""Despicable Me"" and when it has to move for a bit of an action scene, it's all nicely done. I felt that Wednesday was the most rounded of the characters, so it's at least fortunate that she is probably the driving force behind what narrative there is. There weren't many laughs, but what there was were usually generated by Nick Kroll's Uncle Fester.The problems with the film are all with the script and story. It's a lacklustre tale, lacking in set pieces or any real tension. It sets up bits of side plots a couple of times that don't actually end up going anywhere, Wednesday taking over the school, the tension between Morticia and Grandma, for example. It feels like the script was written and rewritten over and over again until it's just a loose collection of scenes with a narrative pasted over the top. Worse than that though, it's not funny. I don't think even the younger kids in the cinema where I saw it found it amusing and there's certainly very little for any adults, or older kids in there.Just about managed to stay awake for the run time, but I don't recommend you try it.",The Addams Family

The Adams being real monsters does make for some good animation.

This is an animated version of the 1938 popular Charles Addams series of cartoons about a ghoulish family that moves to New Jersey. There was a live action tv series and a few live action movies and animated tv series and specials over the years but this is the first animated theatrical release. Oscar voices the father of the family Gomez, Charlize is his wife Morticia, Chloe is their daughter Wednesday and Finn is their son Pugsley, each with their own twisted behaviors and mannerisms. After moving to New Jersey-they had problems with their neighbors in the old country-the Addams family try to fit in but Allison, the local celebrity, doesn't make it easy for them. The character artwork is influenced by the original 1938 cartoons and there is plenty of the ghoulish style of humor that you are probably familiar with from previous incarnations. There are also other cameo voices you might recognize-Snoop Dogg, Bette Midler, Nick Kroll and Martin Short just to name a few. Whether you are a fan-I am-or not, you should enjoy this interpretation.
It's rated ""PG"" for macabre and suggestive humor and some action and has a running time of 1 hour & 27 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The Addams Family

We definitely will go watch the sequel.",7,9 July 2021,"The Addams Family (2019) is a movie my daughter and I watched together as soon as it came out in theatres. The storyline follows our favorite family as they start getting harassed by a neighbor who wants to clean-up the town and start a reality show. She feels the Addam's family ruins the entire landscape and look of the town. She quickly finds out it is pretty hard to get the Addam's family to do things they do not wish to do. This movie is codirected by Greg Tiernan (Sausage Party) and Conrad Vernon (Shrek 2) and includes the voices of Charlize Theron (Monster), Chloë Grace Moretz (Se7en), Bette Midler (Hocus Pocus), Martin Short (Three Amigos) and Snoop Dogg (Baby Boy). The animation for this was awesome and brilliantly depicts the Addam's Family home, surroundings and lifestyle. I loved the depiction of both the family and the neighborhood and how it all worked together on a larger scale like we've never seen before. They also had a good concept for the protagonist.

27,GiraffeDoor,Things have left me with a lot more woe...,7,24 June 2020,We all have some kind of relationship with the Adams Family and some kind of idea of what they SHOULD look and sound like.But I want to judge this movie on its own terms. The attempt at a more vintage visual style translates awkwardly to CGI but that doesn't mean it isn't visually satisfying with it's gothic overtones that contrast with the always sunny suburban wasteland just next door.A strange Dogtooth vibe is our starting point the Enchanting and formidable Wednesday is herself on a journey of self discovery. The theme seems to be individuality and non-conformism and this is handled in a very generic way. The plot is still perfectly diverting and the gags pretty much keep things afloat though I have to say a lot of the time it feels like they did not get this proof read.,The Addams Family

(""Mrs. Pickering"" always sits backwards when using her toilet seat!) Clearly, this half of the characters presented in THE ADDAMS FAMILY--Margaux, her perfidious mob lieutenants, her self-appointed role as the sex police, and her sheep-like ""base"" of deplorable ""core supporters""--are drawn to represent the mindless minority of noisy rabble rousers running America Today. On the other hand, THE ADDAMS FAMILY's title clan denotes the greatly varied quilt of Normal Average Loyal Patriotic True Blue Silent Majority Union Label Progressive Citizens of the USA, who are constantly bullied, brow-beaten, battered, and worse at the hands of the tyrannical treasonous splinter faction. The main problem with this film is its rosy resolution, suggesting to kids that there is a bogus ""both sides"" to this conflict, and that somehow Margaux and her automaton followers will suddenly come to their senses, uphold their Constitutional oaths, and turn over a new leaf. Only demolition expert ""Pugsley Addams"" seems to have a realistic view of the dire situation, as he fights back against the Red Commie dupes with everything that he's got.",The Addams Family

ONE OF THE BEST ANIMATED FILMS EVER!!!!",9,2 March 2020,"I grew up watching & loving the original, first two Classic Addams Family films directed by Barry Sonnefeld from the early 90's & i still love those films today.I wasn't sure about a C. G. I animated kids film version of the Cool & Creepy Addams Family but it turns out that i needn't have even thought about it lol as this New version is fantastic fun & it totally kept the Kooky, Demented & Gothic dark tone & humour of the original 90's Classic's.I was so pleasantly surprised that the dark moody & weird feel & look was kept in a new ""kids"" animated version but it's all there & reminded me so much of the original films & thats a good thing as this is simply a new version for a new generation of kids & youngsters to enjoy.The animation is excellent & suits the that strange gothic fantasy style of the original films & the material.The only real change in a new version is the technology has changed as we have characters with mobile phones but apart from that the movie could've easily have been set in the 80's or 90's!!!The kooky & crazy fun & very funny humour is still there.I loved the look & cinematography of the movie with the colourful pastel coloured all American suburbia town & the dark muted & moody colours of the Addams Family residence.The voice casting was great too & pretty much sounded just like the 90's films with the exception of Uncle Fester, who sounded completely different but still suited his animated look.I loved hearing the great BETTE MIDLER as the crazy witch-like Grandmama, good fun as she was fantastic in the 90's Spooky Family Classic Hocus Pocus. There's also a fun little bit part from Hip Hop legend Snoop Dogg as hairy cousin, IT.Now, Oscar Isaac as Gomez & Charlize Theron as Morticia Addams are fantastic & sound perfect & again, very much like the 90's films, so it almost felt Nostalgic in a way.Wednesday voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz is also perfect here with her serious monotone & moody talking style & her little blonde brother, Pugsley voiced by Finn Wolfhard (IT, Stranger Things, Ghostbusters: Afterlife) is fine too, he's abit more lively here than the old version & that's good as he's more fun.I loved the Horror Comedy Weird Tone to it all, so glad it wasn't watered down for the ""New Kids"" & kept IT'S old school Creepy & Kooky ways.The story is a simple origin tale about when the Addams Family first move to a new place & start a new life in their huge old spooky mansion. The movie is aimed at, it's ok to be different & to not judge people because their different & that's nice & universal even more today in this social media obsessed world. The ""Villain"" of the movie is a perfectionist, Fake & Barbie type of lady named Margaux Needler voiced by Allison Janney, she's a medi-obsessed crazy & sinister head of a ""picture perfect"" suburban town, she sells house's & property there & has her own t.v Show about doing Home makeovers & immediately takes a dislike to the new family on the block, The Addams Family & thinks the weird family will ruin the image of her New ""Perfect"" town. Great voice acting throughout & great music throughout too!!!This movie is simply great fun entertainment for anyone & a nice new movie in the Addams Family franchise or a nice companion piece to the original films.A lovely fun feelgood comedy & ridiculously entertaining.",The Addams Family

34,questl-18592,Some Other Family *snap snap*,6,3 November 2020,"It's always fun to go into a movie with zero expectations and and having said movie exceed them. I'd heard not great things about this and when I watched it myself I was actually pleasantly surprised that I'd laughed and had a decent time. With that said, this scores more towards average because while it's entertaining at times, it's not Addams Family, it's trying way to hard to beat a point home and it feels like it's derivative of a lot of other animated films like Despicable Me and Hotel Transylvania which is pretty much the opposite of the whole Addams Family thing. That and I fully agree with a lot of the sentiment out there, give me this cast, old school Time Burton and I'd love a live action movie.This is a weird one, I think it's an entertaining watch but it's entirely vacuous nonsense. Pretty as it may be on the surface, there's no real substance here behind it's heavy handed comment on conformity and embracing your weirdness. I also don't know that this fits it's demographic because there is a lot of cartoon violence here.

35,aidanratesmovies,"As expected, a quite unnecessary remake",4,16 October 2020,"Without its charm, without a likeable cast, and with some cheap animation- The Addams Family is an unnecessary remake that proves to be entertaining, but lacks any of the qualities that made the original show and 90's films so iconic. The voice acting is honestly quite mediocre, even despite the incredible talent involved. Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Chloe Grace Moretz, Finn Wolfhard, and Snoop Dogg all star within this lifeless dud, but oddly enough, the only star that shines is Nick Kroll as Uncle Fester. Its writing is incredibly generic, forced, and tries way too hard to appeal to modern day children audiences. I get that the film is trying to appeal to kids, I get that it is trying to adapt modern themes, I even get that it tries to be respectful of the original comic by Charles Addams, but all of it together does not work, nor does it work by trying to draw so much attention to it all at once. The film is entertaining to watch, it isn't boring per say, although it can be at times annoying. There is a chuckle or two to be had throughout the film, but not any more than that, and honestly I ended the film with a cringe on my face, and a disappointed feeling in my gut. In the end, The Addams Family is yet another attempt to franchise out and gain kids attention for the sake of profit. There is little joy to be had in this adaptation, and I still question why they decided to reboot/remake the franchise in the first place. I know a second film is already in development, but please, just let the Addams be.

38,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Family Film,7,17 October 2019,"Now I grew up on the two films that came out back in the 90's. I've always pushed to watch more horrific things, even when the age might not have been the most appropriate, but those were some of the more family friendly things I saw. A girl I'm seeing recommending checking this out and I agreed to go with her. The synopsis is an animated version of Charles Addams' series of cartoons about a peculiar, ghoulish family.We start this off with someone getting ready. They screw their boots on and do something similar with their dress. We then see for eye shadow using the ashes of their mother and for blush the ashes of their father. This is Morticia (Charlize Theron) and we see her walking down a cobble street. Normal people flee in fright. She is on her way to her wedding to Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac). It gets interrupted when the townspeople show up with swords, torches and catapults. They are able to get away thanks to Grandma (Bette Midler) and Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll). The couple then flees to find somewhere they can be themselves.This takes them to New Jersey. Thing, a dismembered hand that moves on it own, is driving them. They hit someone who is in a straight-jacket. This turns out to be Lurch (Conrad Vernon). His jacket says there's a hospital for the criminally insane nearby and it is actually on top of a hill. They take it over and call it home. The spirit that lives there isn't necessarily happy about it though.Through pictures we see that this couple has two children. The older is Wednesday (Chloë Grace Moretz) and then Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard). They are constantly trying to kill each other. The house is tense since Puglsey has a party coming up where there's a right of passage that he needs to perform. This involves dancing with a sword and he isn't ready. He instead wants to us explosives. Gomez won't give up on him though.Things take a turn when the swamp that has hid the Addams family is drained and the fog surrounding them goes away. This reveals their house and much to the displeasure of Margaux Needler (Allison Janney). She is taking on a big endeavor for a renovation show she has to make over a whole town called Assimilation. When the Addams family comes to town and scares people for being different, she wants to try to get them to meet her requirements. Wednesday meets the daughter of Margaux, Parker (Elsie Fisher). Wednesday decides she wants to go to normal school, in part to rebel against her parents and the life she's been forced to live. When Margaux doesn't get her way, she takes matter into her own hands with some dark secrets.To start off my recap, I first off have to say I'm shocked by the cast that we have in this film. I think that they do well in embodying the characters. Since this is animated, I can't go much off the actual performances. I do think that Isaac puts on a solid accent and takes on Gomez. Theron gives a different vibe to Morticia, but I also liked that. Moretz was a solid Wednesday. It really works that she plays it so deadpan and without emotion. Wolfhard as Pugsley is also quite good. I did have to laugh at the way Kroll does a lisp for Fester and I also thought Janney was good as the villain here. I guess what I'm trying to say is all of the voice acting was good across the board.The problem that I have is I'm not entirely sure who this film is directed at. It is animated, but I do think a lot of the message is going to go over some kids head. On top of that, I do think there might be a more niche market than they realized here. I get that Hotel Translyvania was quite successfully so they're hoping that this would catch on as well. I would have enjoyed it if I had it as a kid along with my sister. I don't necessarily know if more 'normal' kids who are into the mainstream will take to this though. This does encourage people to be themselves and to not assimilate into what society wants us to. It also has a big aspect of breaking family tradition and not forcing children into doing things that were done in the past as well.This does also a really good job in embodying the Addams family. They say things that are off just a bit and it made me chuckle. In the end though, it does get problematic. Trying to kill your sibling is something that many of us wanted to do growing up, but these kids take it a step too far. I will say that the loving relationship between Gomez and Morticia is wonderful. They really show a couple embracing each other fully.I will admit that being a children's movie, it does have issues building tension for me. The biggest problem is that their house could be destroyed or they could be run out of town. Yes, this is horrible and we should just let them be themselves as they don't bother anyone aside from throwing a party where their odd family members show up. It doesn't truly embody that I know something bad will happen and that I'm concerned for them. I know it will work out in the end and the stakes just aren't necessarily there. I will say that being it runs 86 minutes is at least a perfect length. It doesn't outstay its time for sure.I will give credit to the animation though. It isn't the old school that I'm used to, but it definitely works. It actually feels like a Tim Burton film without being done by him. It is most definitely influenced by German Expressionism. Instead of the house or the scenery being contorted though, it is the people. Morticia and pretty much every young girl aside from Wednesday have impossibly lean bodies. I love this movement of films so seeing its influence is great.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. It has the main theme we know and love. There are some songs that are played for laughs which I didn't mind. We also get Lurch singing REM, which I thought was hilarious. I will have to give credit here as the soundtrack fit for what was needed and I really noticed it in a good way.Now with that said, I'm clearly not the target audience here and to be honest I'm not necessarily sure who is. I like that they tried to do a modern take on this, but going with animated, I'm not sure your more mainstream fans will dig this. It has a good message it is trying to convey of be yourself for sure as well as families needing to break tradition. I think it has a star-studded voice cast and the animation is pretty solid as well. I liked the soundtrack as a whole with a few songs that really made me chuckle. I did think this was above average overall, but definitely not great.",The Addams Family

Missing the Semi-Disturbed approach this series is famous forThe VERDICT:The Addams Family 2019 version is a great display of the variability of interpretation and it works well for a family film for the modern audience. A cute theme is the element of this movie, with nonthreatening animation/design to herald the fun chuckle fest that the dialogue and film are about. It's got appropriate voice acting, a nice sense of comedy that makes the world fun, nostalgia that is not overwhelming, and morals baked right in to get the message of acceptance out in the world. Yet, the containment that they took steals away the intensity, edge, and energy that this series is famous for. It's meant to be quirky and slightly disturbing and that element missing, alongside some dropped story elements may not impress the classic fans like they are hoping. While this movie probably would have been better released on nickelodeon or a fan service, it's got enough elements for a family outing, but hold this one for the home viewing for your maximum buck.My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0

And even then, the movie is widely inconsistent. It basically does whatever it wants whenever it wants without regard to the established rules.This was something that the previous iterations did with some finesse, they always left some mystery to what the rules were, but it never contradicted itself.The aesthetic alone feels pretty grating, and they use it as an excuse to do things that don't make any sense to facilitate the gags, but it again eludes what makes the Addams Family special, that it is weird and crazy things happening in reality.While I do like the attempt to modernize the movie, it ruins some great potential to extend the universe and create new characters in the next generation of things: something more movies need to do.Overall, this movie is just irritating, it has some basic structure to it, but the content is just dull.",The Addams Family
41,eric262003,Good For Both Children and Adults Alike,6,27 September 2021,"It's good to see our crrepy and kooky, mysteroius and spooky clan back again only this time in 3D animation. The parents Gomez and Morticia (Oscar Isaac and Charlize Theron), the children Wednesday and Pugsley (Chloe Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard), their wacky Uncle Fester (Nick Kroll), Grandmama (Bette Midler), their left hand, hand Thing, the loyal butler Lurch (Conrad Vernon) and Cousin Itt (Snoop Dogg) as they await the arrival of their even more macabre and eccentric relatives who are about to celebrate Pugsley 's coming-of-age initiative called the Mazurka to see if he qualifies if he's a true Addams. But their plans are put on hold when a cagey HGTV personailty named Margeaux Needler (Allison Janney) who's intention is to destroy their estate so that he could sell the neighbourhood homes.There is no denying that The Addams Family clan are not the typical family that we are all accustomed to. They are horror type characters who engage in diabolical games that rests between surrealism and the sadistic not just to other people, but often at times to each other. Even though they're eccentric, they are not necessarily evil. They do bond with each other and look out for each other when something of a threat lurks within their horizons.A long time ago I used to watch ""The Addams Family"" on the TV Land station and though the oold show from the 1960's was in black and white, this family was more colourful in their characterizations, because the series gave them more freedom to be themselves and to let them do sadistic stuff to others and to themselves. Their unpredictable daring nature made them icons in the Golden Age of television and are still cherished by their fanbase to this day.Now that ""The Addams Family"" has converted to 3D animation and under the direction of Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan, they have decided to open up to the modern day audience of who this weird and wacky clan and to get a glance into their world of imagination and torture. What they did was succeed in creating a fresh look at Addams by implementing new jokes, new gags and plenty of horror and Goth to the narrative making it not too saccherine while at the same time not too dark so that both kids and adults alike could enjoy this movie. Though I was a big fan of the original Addams Family and the live-action movies in the early 1990's, but it was clear that the narrative and the jokes were too dark for the kids to watch. I can understand when viewers were upset that this adaptation was more kid-friendly than the previous projects, but I still can enjoy the lighter fare it was given here as it's original, fresh and unpredictable as always.When it came to the voice cast, the ensemble was at their A-game giving a bit of their personality to add new takes to their respected character/s. Their coming timing was well executed and the interactions they had with each other shows they enjoyed what they were doing.The macabre nature of this insanely wacky family never once shy away from the sadism they attempt to to onto each other. For example, Pugsley's fixation of hurling explosives at his father, or Wednesday's craft of shooting crossbows and even Morticia enjoying a casual dinner at her outdoor cemetary. These traits alone are solid and entertaining.If there was any weakness to the movie it would have to be the main antagonist character Margeaux Needler. Though Janney did excellent as her voice in the movie, it's the character itself that doesn't sit well for me. Personally her character is one badly overdone cliche. It's never clear what her real true intentions are and why she wants to tear down the Addams Family's estate. Unlike other Addams Family villain like Abigail Craven who wants to evict the Addams Family from their home so that Uncle Fester can led her to search for the vault. Or Debbie Jellinsky who wanted to kill the Addams Family and take their fortunes. At least those villains, we don't necessarily have to like them, but at least they're more fleshed out to undertand them better.The whole moral of loving, understanding and accepting people for who they are regardless of appearance or behaviour is something children could consider when meeting someone who's different from them. It's just that Margeaux was not the right villain to pave the way to the moral lesson of the film's intentions.The other flaw I had with the movie was that the humour was a hit or miss situation. There were some scenes where I had a few good laughs. However, balancing humour geared towards both adults and children can be a bit complex because you want to appease a wider demographic, but in the end it feels a bit awkward especially when they reached lower standards by implementing a fart joke.And finally there are some scenes that should have never made the cut. All it did was just drag on with no reason or purpose. Sure the film thank goodness for the most part was energetic and fast-paced, and ran a respectable 1hr. And 27 min. And both adults and children can find humour in places that suits their level of enjoyment.Other than the main flaws being an underdeveloped villain and scenes that drag on for no reason, ""The Addams Family"" is something we can enjoy with larger than life characters, great humour and fun to watch with an unsual family doing unpredictable activities.",The Addams Family

43,Abdulxoxo,Totally forgettable,5,7 January 2021,"Addams family follows the story of a newly wedded couple Gomez and Morticia, who are forced out of their neighbourhood by villagers with torches and pitchforks. They move to New Jersey where they set up home in a dilapidated old house on top of a hill. Thirteen years later their happily unhappy existence, alongside their children, Wednesday and Pugsley, is challenged when a home renovation show decides to build a bright and colourful little town at the base of the hill. There are additional subplots; one involving Wednesday rebelling by wearing 'normal' clothes. Also, Pugsley is preparing for some kind of ceremony involving swordplay that all Addams family members must perform at a certain age.
First off, the animation is not enticing, I'll just admit I'm not a fan of this style of animation (characters being overtly skinny or fat). Truth be told there really wasn't anything in this film I can say that I loved. The character of Lurch, when he plays the piano or sing, is probably the highlight - but that really isn't saying much.
The story is surprisingly dull, given how eccentric these characters usually are. There aren't many moments where the horror elements of the family are explored. Worst of all, however, is probably the lack of comedy. Apart from Lurch, and few jokes that actually lands, i really struggled to find anything even remotely funny. The voice acting is pretty good. The score is creepy and atmospheric.

50,phubbs,The Addams Family,7,21 January 2020,"In 1938 Charles Addams created a cartoon family that would become his legacy. The Addams family was a satirical inversion of your typical American family of the time. The all American family was seen a certain way and this was Addams twisted view on the matter. Addams macabre little family of ghouls, misfits, and monsters has since gone on to become a staple of American pop culture alongside the similarly themed Munster Family with cartoons, TV series, and movies. This 2019 animated movie is apparently a reboot of the classic 1991 movie.The plot is unfortunately you're average affair which has been played out many many many times before (including the 1993 film 'Addams Family Values' and the basis for the entire 1992 animated series). The Addams move into their new home (I'll get to that) and go about their daily strange lives. All the while Gomez and Morticia are keeping Pugsley and Wednesday unaware of the small local town nearby. Their reason is they know they will come across as weird outcasts to the 'normies' and they don't want Pugsley or Wednesday to deal with it.As expected Wednesday does eventually discover the outside world and wants to explore it after meeting another local girl her own age. As expected Morticia is firmly against this but struggles to keep Wednesday from exploring. Meanwhile in the town there is an obsessive reality TV host who is wanting to turn the local town into the perfect community; as expected the Addams are getting the way of her vision. Her solution? Get rid of the Addams family.So firstly as already mentioned, at the start of this movie we see Gomez and Morticia before they are married. We also see how they get the mansion and how they meet Lurch. None of this satisfied me in the slightest. Allow me to elaborate. Firstly where does Morticia live at the very start? It appears as though she's living in the sewers? Eh?? Where is this located? It kinda looks like a period set village. Secondly, after the newlyweds are run out of whatever town they live in, they reach an abandoned loony bin. This asylum becomes their new home, the Addams mansion. I hated this! Surely in Addams lore the mansion has been the family home for generations of Addams before Gomez and Morticia, right? But here they just stumble upon it and basically take it? Does this mean the Addams family are swatting in this abandoned asylum? I mean, they haven't bought it, surely it belongs to the state (?).This leads me to the introduction of Lurch. Gomez hits Lurch with his car just before they find the abandoned asylum. Turns out Lurch is an ex-patient of the asylum and is somehow just wondering around in the wild. So how did Lurch get into this situation? What happened to the asylum? Why wasn't Lurch switched to another asylum with the other patients? (I'm guessing that's what happened). This also leads me to query Lurch's mental state seeing as he's a patient. He isn't working for the Addams by choice per se, it happened by accident and mentally he's not stable. So with the proper help, he could get well again and this could mean he wouldn't want to be a butler for the Addams. So if you wanna be technical and picky, this plotline basically has a mentally sick person being abused for the Addams gain, almost slavery. They should have just stuck to the original storyline.Indeed the opening of the movie does lend itself to many questions as I've mentioned. I really didn't like how they handled it because I was left yearning to know more about the origins of the family. Where does Gomez hale from? What was Morticia doing in the sewers? What about the other Addams family members etc...Ripe for a prequel. Alas I really don't like the way they went with the origins for the mansion and Lurch. Also the fact they wanted to live somewhere dangerous and away from people who don't understand them, so they chose New Jersey. Yeah I know its a joke but obviously there are far better, more isolated places they could have gone.I do like how the characters now resemble the original comic strips from Charles Addams from back in 1938. Neat touch although not entirely necessary to be truthful. As the two 90's movies proved the characters can be highly successful not looking exactly the same. I say this because I've never been a fan of the original look for Gomez. I loved how Morticia seemed to be portrayed as a bit of a gothic at the start of the movie with her black knee-high boots, black mini skirt, and black tight-fitting corset. Nice to see the Addams pet octopus (now named Socrates) make an appearance. Oscar Isaac did a great job with Gomez's voice and actually sounded like the late Raul Julia (unsure if that was intentional). But I would have liked to have seen a bit more of Uncle Fester. Must admit I didn't like some of the designs for other Addams family members.I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard about it (I'm a huge Addams fan). And whilst I'm not totally disappointed, this wasn't quite as good as I was hoping for. Visually its gorgeous no doubt. I love how the mansion looks both exterior and interior (would have liked to see more of that really. Mores secret passages etc...) Would have liked to see more of the Addams estate too, the grounds around the house.As said the plot is a bit deary and unoriginal leading to screentime with 'regular characters' which, for me, were the boring parts because I just wanted to see the Addams getting up to spooky hijinks. Yes it's for kids but not overtly so, there are some nice tiny touches here and there that will make older folks smile. The small 'IT' gag was appreciated. A quick exorcist visual reference and a clever and quite adult-themed visual gag surrounding Thing being online was amusing. So yeah its solid but I hated what they did with Lurch and the mansion origins, can't get past that. Oh and the rap song over the end credits is nowhere near as good as MC Hammer's 'Addams Groove'.7/10",The Addams Family
51,rockman182,The Addams Family (2019),6,12 October 2019,"I'm participating in the 31 Days of Horror movies tradition myself and am always sure to check out any horror film that comes to the cinema during the month. I enjoyed the original Addams Family films enough, though I've never watched the series. It was odd to me at first that an animated version of the franchise was being made but didn't feel deterred checking it out with a very good voice cast to boot. I know that many weren't crazy about the film and I'm kind of in the middle myself. Its a serviceable entry.The film is about the classic cooky and spook Addams Family. Their house in New Jersey is in a town where a reality host is trying to grow her business in the territory and then eventually heads with the family as she tries to expose and get rid of these ""monsters"". The family also deal with regular family things, such as their children going through identity changes and interacting with the real world.There were a few moments in the film that got a good chuckle out of me. I think the voice acting and animation were both perfectly fine. The problem was mainly with the script. Maybe going the route of having the family face off against the local TV personality wasn't the best course of action. Its obvious that this was going to be a way safer adaptation as it is animated and really meant for children as well but I felt like the writing of jokes and dialogue could have been sharper and wittier.There isn't much at all to remember about this film. Its a decent time at the theater, although you may find more enjoyment if you are a fan of the series. For a casual fan like me, it does its job as an animated feature nothing more and nothing less. Its still a rather fun month of binging favorite horror films so it was different venturing to a more child friendly and animated horror themed movie.6.5/10",The Addams Family
52,RforFilm,The creepy and kooky story of The Addams Family is more aimed for children this time,5,17 October 2019,"""They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky. They're all together ooky, The Addams Family"". I may be easy to say that most people know The Addams family, first as a comic strip before becoming a television series and even spawning two movies from the nineties, that are both good. So what do we like about them? Even though it's easy to point out a lot of the dark and macabre atmosphere and jokes the family embraces, lives by, and doesn't even care that the rest of the world finds them weird. The real connection is that despite the dark nature, the family is close and love each other in a way a lot of normal families wish they could.I've liked the idea of keeping the series going and with a new movie going for an animated route, I'll admit that it isn't a bad idea. I know that there was a series back in 1992 (which I haven't seen) but perhaps more spooky elements and monsters and perhaps other Addams members we haven't seen could shine in animation. Though it's a little disappointing that with The Addams Family, it's clearly going for a more kid friendly audience, but I'm still open.In a really funny introduction, Gomez (played by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (played by Charlize Theron) are married, chased out of town by angry villagers, and find a home in an abandoned mental asylum where they bring along Fester (played by Nick Kroll), a sentient hand called Thing, and loyal butler Lurch. Cut to some years later where their children Pugsley (played by Finn Wolfhand) and Wednesday (played by Chloë Grace Moretz) are teenagers and have never left the house. The family seems content with their existence, but as most kids do, wonder about the outside world.Pugsley is getting ready for an Addams tradition called a ""Mazurka"", which is a rite of passage for every Addams boy. Though he knows how important it is to his dad, he struggles with learning the old traditions. At the same time, Wednesday notices balloons and confetti from the outside world and wants to explore it more, much to the chagrin of her mother. In town, the rest of it has been beatified by reality TV star Margaux Needler (played by Allison Janney) who notices the old mansion not fitting in. As she descends upon the mansion to fix it, the Addams get a glimpse of the normal world.It's clear that the writers know the Addams work best when their away from home and clashing with the modern world. The Addams Family certainly has funny ideas, but the overall result is simply okay. It's an okay story, okay acting, and even okay animation. I've said before that doing The Addams Family in an animated format has potential, but the final design of all the characters are weird. I'm not sure if that was the intention (and I know the designs are supposed to be close to the original comic), but the bodies are too thin against a lot of the heads.The biggest problem however isn't the design, but rather the story. So the Addams would be chased out of town. Then what? Wouldn't their immortal selves easily overpower them? Would the townspeople even care enough to chase them out? I know the story is going for a social media related mob mass commentary, but the script doesn't know how to balance it out with what everyone else is going though. At least with the live action Addams Family, the villains kept trying to separate them, thus being more of a threat to their world.Though it's slightly hindered by a PG rating, it still does give us plenty of dark imagry and gives us a neat mansion to look at. In fact, if the story wasn't given enough attention, they at least put in enough jokes to give me some laughs. One of the better parts was that Wednesday was becoming more rebellious by acting...normal. That alone got some good ideas (including a joke about a unicorn I won't give away). I think that the movie needed more focus from the Addams point of view as the final message is fine (even funny from their perspective), but the it's something we've heard a lot before.I'll give this five Lurchs out of ten. At best, this might be a better Addams Family to show to kids, but even then, I would still pick the live action ones over this. At it's best, it's harmless. At it's worst, it's not as creative as it thinks. Take it for what it is, and see if this creepy and kooky story is for you.",The Addams Family
53,Anurag-Shetty,Reminded me of my childhood.,8,8 November 2019,"The Addams Family is based on the comic strip of the same name, created by Charles Addams, that spun-off into TV shows, cartoons & movies. Gomez Addams(Oscar Isaac), Morticia Addams(Charlize Theron), Wednesday Addams(Chloe Grace Moretz) & Pugsley Addams(Finn Wolfhard) move into a new neighborhood. Here the weird but lovable family, face some unexpected challenges.The Addams Family is a great film. Directors Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon have given us a movie that is filled with nostalgia for people who know the titular characters, while simultaneously introducing The Addams Family to a new generation. The animation is superb. The 3D is eye-popping. The humor is a bit hit-and-miss but that can be forgiven, because most of the jokes mainly appeal to kids. Oscar Isaac is outstanding as Gomez Addams. Charlize Theron is spectacular as Morticia Addams. Chloe Grace Moretz is mind-blowing as Wednesday Addams. Finn Wolfhard is fantastic as Pugsley Addams. Nick Kroll is hysterical as Uncle Fester. Allison Janney is perfect as Margaux Needler. Elsie Fisher is brilliant as Parker. The supporting cast is good. The Addams Family is worth a watch, with your entire family.

54,silvermistvio,A normal film with simple story.,4,18 February 2020,"I knew the Adams family from a Doctor Who episode where Clara mentioned about the hand from ""The Adams Family"". (She wanted the 12th Doctor to move the TARDIS with his hand like in The Adams Family.) At that time, I didn't know what the Adams family is. I just thought The Adams Family is a TV series. So, I didn't watch it. A few weeks ago, I found this film, so, because of the word ""The Adams Family"", I've chose to watch.The film is just a normal. It might be a good film to the others, but as for me, it doesn't have any different things. To be honest, I took a lot of days to finish this one because I wanted to watch the other films rather than this. Today morning, I thought I should finish unfinished film which is this one.What made me amazed is Chloe Grace Mortez which act as Wednesday. Her voice seemed to be different and she being like lack of any emotion is very different from those characters she was in.The story is simple, and it's the story we always see. Supporting characters are framing or making the lead ones look bad. And in the end, the truth gets out and everyone knows the leading role characters are not bad ones. So, I don't want to give any comment on it. That's why I said the story is simple and the film becomes so normal.As for conclusion of this review, the film is not that good and it's not that bad either.

Why do the normal humans in this movie look more like monsters than the actual monsters? The animation looks like it came from the late 2000's to the beginning 2010's It looks like it came out around the time of the first dispicable me?!! I think a lot of the problem was their decision to use the original character designs. These were characters designed solely to appear in single-panel woodblock-style artwork, usually in extremely ""arch"" key poses. They were never meant to be animated. And you can see it, in how janky they look in motion. We definitely didn't need an Addams family animated movie tbh. Especially one as bland and sterile as this. What a shame. I love the Adams and was looking forward to this being good. Guess it's too much to ask for good CGI huh? Bolt from 2008 looks better than this crap.

61,MrDHWong,A mildly entertaining update to the beloved kooky family but stumbles at being a coherent adaptation at the most crucial of times,6,9 April 2020,"The Addams Family is a CGI animated film based on the series of cartoons created by Charles Addams. Featuring the voices of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Finn Wolfhard, it is a mildly entertaining update to the beloved kooky family but stumbles at being a coherent adaptation at the most crucial of times.In New Jersey, the oddly ghoulish Addams family, consisting of patriarch Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac), his wife Morticia (voiced by Charlize Theron), daughter Wednesday (voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz), and son Pugsley (voiced by Finn Wolfhard) all make their home in an abandoned asylum on top of a hill far away from the rest of society. Blissfully unaware of the outside world, the family's idyllic, tight-knit existence is soon challenged by reality TV host Margaux Needler (voiced by Allison Janney), who plans to build a perfect happy community of ""normal"" people as a means to increase the ratings for her show. After the family refuses to conform to her standards, Margaux becomes determined to band her community together to run the Addams out of town once and for all, using the family's weird and frightening image as her main excuse.Even though I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do for today's audiences, this modernised take on The Addams Family feels too watered down to leave the impact it should. The main issue here is the light-hearted tone, which detracts strongly from the source material's dark nature and satirical elements. I understand that this film is primarily aimed at young children and too much darkness may end up scaring them, but previous adaptations, both live action and animated, were able to strike the correct balance between horror and humour to appease all ages, yet this one does not. A more appropriate director at the helm, like Tim Burton, would have been a better choice for a film like this. In fact, as I am typing, I'm surprised this match made in heaven hasn't already happened by now.Artwise, the film borrows heavily from the original Charles Addams cartoons, with the characters' proportions looking caricaturish and less human-like. Some viewers may be put off by this stylistic choice but I actually liked how the animators implemented it for the most part, as it shows respect to the material it has been adapted from. In addition to this, there is a nice use of juxtaposition of the bleak, drab appearance of each of the Addams family members with that of the brightly lit colours of the outside world, to further remind us of how much they stand out in a crowd.All of the voice actors were perfectly cast, with each of them adding the right amount of macabre fun to their performances. Out of all of them, I found that Chloe Grace Moretz stood out the most as Wednesday Addams, playing the role in all her deadpan glory. This may be due to Wednesday always being my personal favourite member of the Addams family and that I find much to enjoy in seeing how she interacts with the outside world. I have always admired the way she (and the rest of her family for that matter) stayed true to herself, unlike the other supposedly ""normal"" people she comes into contact with. I still think Christina Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday in the early 90s live action films is the definitive version of the character but I am confident that Chloe Grace Moretz's interpretation will be enough to please today's generation of moviegoers.Despite its obvious flaws, it's hard to truly hate this film due to some of the respectable care shown in bringing this gruesome family back to the big screen. There is certainly potential to iron out these problems in the upcoming sequel and return to the series' macabre roots. It happened with the live action films, with 1993's ""Addams Family Values"" proving to be stronger than its 1991 predecessor so it's reasonable to assume that the possibility will always be there.I rate it 6/10",The Addams Family

You've got a plethora of incredible voice talents involved in this movie, but it still didn't manage to live up to the fantastically bizarre, shocking humour of Raul Julia's films in the 90s. Those films weren't specifically targeted at children as this one is; there was always something sophisticated and grown up about the Addams Family and Addams Family Values.

Uncle Fester, that for me was always among all, the best one, does not let down: his jokes are funny, and he is so dumb, exactly what I was expecting from him. Good job by Charlize Theron that gave her voice to Morticia, an amazing characterization. Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing of Wednesday. The attempt to create an apathetic character, without any emotion, failed miserably on front of secondary characters such as Pugsley or Gomez Addams, for example. I would have pass on her, but she is the main character of the story, she's the real protagonist of this movie, but unfortunately Chloe Moretz cannot deliver a convincing performance. This was a big let down for me.The movie has the usual light-hearted plot, that delivers also a moral lesson, that can be useful in life, both for kids and for adults, considering how our society can be cruel with people that slightly different from the usual standards. The Addams Family is entertaining, and perfect to be watched with your family. It mix funny and creepy in a creative way and it delivers a nice and enjoyable plot.

PG
director: Greg Tiernan,Conrad Vernon
starring: Charleze Theron,Oscar Isaac,Chloe grace Moretz,Finn Wolfhard,Nick Kroll,Snoop dogg,Alison Jenney,Bette midler,Maggie Wheegleroverall rating 71/100This film is about a strange family called the addama who distance themselves from normal human lives. But during there preparation for there youngest son Pugsley ( Finn Wolfhard) when the Towns resident reality show host for houses Margaux needler ( Alsion Janney) wants to renovate there home due to it looking out of the ordinary. Things take a turn for the worse where the whole village turns against the Addams. Addams family was a lot of fun but i found it could of been a lot better.First of all the dark and strange tone was fantastic. The film didn't hold back with how strange the addams family is which i loved. As they could of easily watered it down for a more younger audience but due to its PG rating they didn't. I just loved the depth they went into showing how strange everyone was. Whether it was them as expected finding horrible things amazing or the way they wake up in the mornings. And one of my favourite scenes of the film showing this would largely be any scene with just Mortician( Charleze Theron) She drilled screws into her legs for trousers. Tightened her corset to make her waist slimmer. and used her parents ashes for eye make up. I just loved the creativity that went into the characters.Next due to there strangeness the film was also very funny. The script was very clever in creating humour. The strange actions of the Addams family clashing with the "" normal members"" of the village bought a lot of comedic moments. All the characters were funny in there own way which i loved as there wasn't any particular standouts they were all equal.Next i thought the animation and the character designs were fantastic. The film itself looked beautiful and the design of the Addams house and everything they come into contact with fitted in with the overall tone of the film which i loved. And i really enjoyed all the character designs of all of the addams family. I thought the creativity behind all the characters was fantastic and it also bought some humour to the film as some of Less frequently used addams look great. Including onions bushes and a tall grandma who was actually small so this just fitted in with tone of the film.Next however i really didn't like the villain. I just found her incredibly generic and simple. And her motivations for going against the addams was bland and poorly executed. She just bored me as a villain. And i also did get bored of some of the more key addams characters. Yes what they did around the house was funny and strange at first but it got fairly repetitive with the parents. Due to the kids largely being the main focus they didn't have any interesting arcs with Morticcia ( Charleze Theron and Gomez (Oscar Isaac) so they were just left doing the same thing which was a shame but they were still largely fun characters but they should of been more important within the film.Next i loved the films messages and themes portrayed to everyone were good. I love that the theme of being different can be a good thing and accepting everyone for themselves is a good message to spread to younger audiences watching as some can relate to being treated like outsiders. And the key character that portrayed this was Wednesday ( Chloe Grace Moretz) she was by far my favourite character. Her deadpan and blunt humour worked for me. And she had the most interesting arc with trying to be different in order to fit in with everyone else. So i feel as if her character is someone people can relate to the most.And for my final positive i have to say the obvious the soundtrack was fantastic. they had many instances of the famous clicking and theme tune that i loved. It bought out a lot of nostalgia for me and it was always executed perfectly and not overused which i loved.However time for my final negative unfortunately the film had very dull and slow pacing for a large majority of the run time. A large majority of the film was just repeated days at the house which despite there being fun parts to this i got bored in places. and even when they went into a high school i thought they executed that in a generic non interesting way apart from Wednesdays involvement. Yes it picked up in the final act which i loved but i would of liked them to make the films plot be consistently interesting and entertaining which i am afraid they were not able to do.
overall despite the film needing to be structured better and needing to have more fleshed out characters. Its still a fun ride and i am glad they have bought the addams family into the 21st century.",The Addams Family

I hardly think that's obvious kid's material. I also think they did a tremendous job with Wednesday, her design was perfect and she steels every scene she's in. Another standout was Lurch, again wonderfully brought to life by the studio. Obviously there were somethings I didn't love, like the animation, which was what put me off in the trailer, while not as bad as I feared it still is not up to the standards of Pixar or Disney, and the whole story with the villain was not very good resulting in a very unsatisfactory ending, but nevertheless I ended up really enjoying this movie.",The Addams Family
80,Hallelujah289,"Dark, spooky, brilliant!",9,9 October 2020,"Worthy of being called an Addams Family film. Really uses violence and terror in the most wholesome way. Has a message about conformity vs nonconformity and most uniquely, where the two overlap. A smart, edge of the blade, fascinating family film. Familiar but varied musical score, with lots of welcome pop songs I'll be listening to again. Not the usual character design-somewhat ugly, but beautifully rendered and textured and in high definition grotesque. A joy for family and adults alike.",The Addams Family
81,TheVictoriousV,I'mma say it: not my Addams Family,4,12 October 2019,"Let's make something clear from the get-go. Design-wise, there is little wrong with the new Addams Family movie, especially if you regard faithfulness. Yes, most of you may remember Gomez Addams as the romantic Raul Julia type, but in the original comics, he was, in fact, a stout and ghastly-looking fellow. This is a monstrous family, after all (but they aren't strictly supernatural creatures, mind; that would be the Munsters).What's truly wrong with the new Addams Family, outside of trying to make the Addamses into victims for freaking normies out (they've always been pretty unapologetic), is the same thing that's wrong with a lot of contemporary kiddie films, especially in terms of marketing. They have taken these timeless, old-school characters, universally amusing due to their backward ideas of what's nice and what's nasty, and tried to make them hip with the smartphone generation, which supplies quite enough cringe without your nauseating attempts at being cool and trendy with it. I laughed when I saw Uncle Fester's ""It's gonna be lit"" poster, although not for reasons intended by Universal.The cast, as per the norm of modern animated movies, is full of stars that are better for ticket sales than they are for voice work. Oscar Isaac plays Gomez (as he's wanted to do for some time), Charlize Theron is Morticia, Chloë Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard give the film extra Zillennial cred as Addams kiddies Wednesday and Pugsley, Nick Kroll does Fester, Bette Middler is a good fit as Grandmama, Snoop Dogg has absolutely no reason to be Cousin Itt, and Conrad Vernon vocalizes Lurch, the Frankensteinian butler. Nobody voices Thing, which is just as well.The plot: as I may have implied, it's the Addams family in the 21st century. A reality TV star (Allison Janney) becomes their enemy when they move into New Jersey and are seen as creepy and kooky. This unabashed ghastliness is what made them charming, but now, we're meant to pity them as unjustly cast out, which is pretty idiotic. Meanwhile, the grandparents from Morticia's side of the family (Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara) are coming to visit, among other relatives.Of course, the jokes that ensue are nothing surprising - ""the Addamses think horrific things are wonderful"" is the main premise, outside of some more low-brow gags - but there are few laughs to be had. And in spite of what I said, some of these A-listers do deliver the lines in a way that makes the jokes land, particularly Moretz as Wednesday. Is it enough to sit through the pandering bits? Not really, no.The movie is not produced by any of the big animation studios, even though the aforementioned eye-rolling moments may bring Illumination, Sony Imageworks, and even Dreamworks to mind. One of the production companies is MGM and I'm fairly certain it's not their animation division (which gave us sequels to The Secret of NIMH and All Dogs Go to Heaven), since that studio has been dormant since the end of the 20th century. So it could've been worse (although I admit to liking these particular designs better as 2D drawings, or perhaps if they were Nightmare Before Christmas-type puppets; they don't seem at home in this bright, Minions-esque style).Alas, it is still very much another ""hip with the kids"" 3D update that nobody begged Hollywood for and will probably be remembered by no-one (minus the neo-emos who will no doubt create gifs of Morticia Addams and go ""that is sooo me"") after said kids are done enjoying its gross humor, references, and eventual rap songs. Yes, there now exists a trap remix of the Addams Family theme tune and it is unironically included on the soundtrack. Why on Earth does that surprise you?",The Addams Family
82,gareth-75442,"Totally enjoyable kids film, ignore the moronic bad reviews",8,27 December 2019,"A really enjoyable animated movie of the addams family.
Let's face it between the original live action TV series, the 2 theatrical releases, the straight to video movie, the live action & animated TV series & the Broadway musical in 2009 there isn't a lot left that can be done with this franchise (given that it originated in the late 30s from about 150 unrelated single panel cartoons)
but this latest movie attempts that & I think it achieves it, its obvious it's aimed at a young generation & that's good because if a franchise like this is going to survive & eventually have new life then its going to be because a newer younger audience is going to want it.
To all you negative ninnys out there giving this less than 5 & adding your stupid contradicting reasons why this isn't to your liking, wise up its not for you.
The animation is excellent, the addams family characters look very similar to the original cartoon panel drawings & the fun & hilarity is in the character, actions & reactions of the family themselves, there's very little plot because after all this is the everyday story of the addams family, thankfully the writers stayed away from adding stupid inane jokes & decided to instead allow the comedy to flow through the story.",The Addams Family
83,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Snaps for Addams Family,8,12 October 2019,"I thought this was a horrifyingly good time. I thought it was funny and got some genuine laughs out of me. Yes, there are jokes that are going to be more geared towards kids like fart jokes for instance...it is a family movie afterall. But plenty little nods and winks for the adults to enjoy as well. It had nice message to it as well..embracing people for who they are and all, and there was some possible coding in the movie that I thought was interesting too. I didnt bring any kids with me but this was plenty of them in my theater and they seem to be quite engaged with the story and were laughing along with it. There were a couple of things - mostly character wise - that didnt always ring true. Like at one point (as Wednesday is going through a bit of rebellious phase) decides to run away...and you'd think the family would like that sort of thing considering how opposite they are to modern society. But they don't. That didnt really detract from my overall enjoyment though.Other things I liked, I thought the cast did a good job. Most notably Charlize Theron as Morticia and Chloe Grace Moretz as Wednesday. I really thought they had the essence of their characters down. If I had to pick a weak link, I'd say Finn Wolfhard. Its not that he's bad....but it felt like he could be voicing anyone, you know. There wasnt a moment where I felt ""Yes, that's Pugsley"".Overall, it was cute and I enjoyed it. And I think this will be a fun movie to re-visit.",The Addams Family

86,RhapsodyReviews,Unnecessary Take on a Beloved Story.,4,21 October 2019,"Review:
'The Addams Family' is an animated-comedy-horror directed by Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan. It is based on the comics of the same name by Charles Addams.
Upon watching this movie, the family and I sat down to watch the original film from 1991. I love that movie, and think it's really well done, so I was excited to see what they could do in an animated film. I knew they would expand the lore and make it fit into todays world, but what they did made for a boring plot line that just seemed to drag on.
The movie starts off with Gomes and Morticia (Oscar Isaac and Charlize Theron) getting married, but their wedding is interrupted by an angry mod making them flee from town and find a new home for their growing family. On the road they come across an abandoned asylum that seems to be haunted by an entity. Being the family we know they fall in love with the place and make it their new home to start a family. We jump 13-years and Wednesday and Pugsley (Chloë Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard) are teenagers and have never been outside of the premises. A TV crew for home makeovers show up and wants to kick them out of town so they can sell the houses they demoed in the town. The Addams family isn't going to be run out of town that easily again.
As I stated previously the plot itself was lacking big time, so the movie needed to be saved by the voice acting. I will say for the most part I enjoyed most of the characters, but there were a few characters that sounded way off to what we knew from previously renditions of this story. I love Finn Wolfhard and think he in an incredible actor, but his voice for Pugsley was just his regular voice, and it did not suit the character at all. Also, Nick Kroll voiced Uncle Fester and he was hit and miss sometimes, and in a movie telling a story as loved at 'The Addams Family' everybody needs to be on their A game.
Yes, the movie does have a few laughs here and there, mostly due to Lurch and Fester. There was also one side plot that I really enjoyed that has to do with Wednesday going to Public School which is a ot of fun.
Overall, other than the few funny scenes the movie as a whole is pretty forgettable and there is really no reason to watch it over the live action films from the 90's.

88,gilleliath,okay for the kids,6,26 April 2020,"Those of us who are uneasy about the current compulsory weekly public applause might well sympathise with the Addamses in their attempts to deal with the weirdly, aggressively positive world of chirpy 'normals'. But 'monsters are people too' is now a very a stale theme (in fact the plot is much the same as Hotel Transylvania) and, although the traditional quirky, macabre humour is there, this feels very much like the re-tread it is. The idea originated as a comic strip, and is difficult to turn into a feature film; this makes me realise what a good job the 90s version did, and it misses the charm of actual human leads like Anjelica Houston and Raul Julia.",The Addams Family
89,shoobe01-1,Not sure why I am supposed to hate this,8,16 May 2021,"My best guess is reflexive nostalgia.It's a new and different version of the classic and therefore people default hate it. Of course the nostalgia is all too often for the 1990s movies, or the 1964s TV show. Whereas I like all of them, all the way back to the Charles Addams single-frame cartoons. I think I have a collection of the cartoons around here.I am super judgemental about film and this was fine on first viewing, entirely engaging, honest to the characters and preserved much of the mythology developed over the various properties, instead of being a ""reboot"" and starting over or anything. I did appreciate the new-to-me origin story of how and why they moved, instead of just ""the old country"" being vaguely referenced.I suspect I will, over time, grow to love it as much as all the others, once I get used to it.",The Addams Family
90,snowfre,"Nicely packaged but the animation, neither the story, works all the way through",5,11 May 2020,"The creepy, gookey, and spooky Addams Family is back in an all CGI-animated feature film, that brings the laughs you'd expect but disappoints with a script thin as water, rather than thick as blood. Oscar Isaac and Charlize Theron make the cut for the family's patriarch and matriarch, the others are barely passable. The overall gruesome nature of the comedy which has become trademark for the stories about the Addams Family, is present but the film lacks a more solid antagonist and plot to lift the humor up. The mechanic animation doesn't help either.",The Addams Family

Can I shoot whoever drew up these characters? They're so insanely ugly looking. I mean the mom and the butler is somewhat okay but wednesday, gomez, pugsly, and fester look insanely horrible and it bugged me the whole movie. Everything else is okay but no where near as good as the likes of Pixar or Disney.Story:
This is what made the film so bad.. the plot was really really horrible and boring. Literally the whole story is about them moving to a house and being judged by neighbours.. that's it. There is no real danger and no real problem. There is so much pointless dialog as well with the occasional funny moment but pretty much dull and mundane story as you'll see.Summary:
So there is occasional funny moments/bits but they're very much over shadowed by mundane and boring plot direction with very ugly character design and what more some characters dont even feel like the original and lose their spunk.

93,Golden_Hope,Basic but Fine,4,17 June 2020,"I don't really have any nostalgic memories of The Addams Family movies from the 90s. I have seen them but only recently and i thought they were both great but i don't have that nostalgic love for them like others.People who loved the old movies seem to hate these movies and i can agree. It wa very very basic. I know its a children's film but so were the 90s ones but they were wrote great, the actors were fab and this is just chock full of things i hate about recent children's movies like stupid pop culture things, over use of phones and like social media. I get it these are big things for kids but it is so pandering and you can tell its like an adult writing it that's like ""You know what kids love Tock Tic and Twittergram so lets have people in the movie love social media and instead of people using an actual on fire touch in a mob scene lets have them have pictures of lit torches on their phones because kids will find that hilarious"".The other issue plaguing children's movies these days which this movies suffers from is stunt casting. I get it, it helps sell tickets but some of the voices just don't work. Finn Wolfhard just doesn't fit well as the voice of Puglsey and he isn't the only one i didn't enjoy Nick Kroll as Uncle Fester he was just annoying to me where as Christopher Lloyd makes him a loveable oaf-type.This movie was also very unfunny. I know i am not the target audience but the jokes were just like ??? i can't imagine that people thought that they would be funny even to a child.It is a children's film so i didn't expect much and its like fine. Your kids might like it especially if they have no reference for The Addams family prior. I do think people who like The Addams Family property will not like this film though as it removes the darkness and sarcastic nature of other incarnation and replaces it with a very basic story.",The Addams Family

The director missed the idea about Tish and Gom. They are hot, passionate, they are in love beyond all love stories, he is bit naive, she is sharp. That's the Tish and Gomez people want.

102,stefstars,Cute for the kids at least,4,14 October 2019,"What I really appreciate of this version of The Addams Family is how the character design is modeled after the original 1930's comic version. The other characters though (the ones that aren't related to The Addams Family) were given the Illumination studios treatment, in other words they're exaggerated and ugly looking, sorry to say. I suppose that made it easy to dislike them, especially the main antagonist.In terms of story, one plot line was more interesting than the other. That being the main one, which is the local ""world renowned"" interior designer trying to chase The Addams out of the small New Jersey town cos they don't fit her idea of perfection. The other storylines had to do with Pugsley following the family tradition of sword fighting or sword performing ? And Wednesday having a ""Little Mermaid"" phase by wanting to explore the small town at the bottom of the hill and rebel against her family's macabre aesthetic. The latter seemed very out of character, they could have thought up a better storyline for little Wednesday. As for the Pugsley story, it just wasn't interesting, even Gomez and Fester give up on continuing that one fairly quickly.Now the main plot line was obviously alluding to a real life situation we have going on. Even the character design of the main antagonist resembles a female version of a real life villain we're all familiar with, including her habit of ""tweeting"" lies about the Addams to instill fear within the other residents of her town. I appreciated this little allusion and can appreciate that they're teaching kids not to discriminate or let themselves be lead by one person's words on a group of people just because of the position that person is in. You can't accuse me of reading that deep into it because it's right there staring you in the face, from the setting in New Jersey (the home state of the real life villain they're alluding to) The main antagonist's character design (her exaggerated blonde hairdo looks awfully familiar) and Gomez dialogue with this character, specifically where he tells her how their family was mistreated in their home country and when his visiting relatives see the new houses that have been built they'll want to move in. Plus at the end, the rest of the residents put their prejudices behind them when they realize that The Addams are a family like any other regardless of how they dress or their taste for darker things - die mad that this movie blatantly instilled human decency or as some of the slower people call (P.C cUlTuRe) into an Addams family film. It wouldn't be the first time, lest we forget when Christina Ricci's Wednesday did her speech on Native American's mistreatment by the awful pilgrims.I appreciate the main message it got across but the way to getting there wasn't well executed. Things were rushed and as mentioned before the other two storylines were not as interesting. Also Finn Wolfhart's voice did not match Pugsley well, not sure what it was just seemed out of character. The ending recreation of the 1960's show opening credits was a nice little finishing touch though.",The Addams Family

The animation is so terrible, it actually looks like something you would find in a Walmart bargain bin. It's plastic and hard to look at. The writing and story is a joke in and of itself. It has a cliche and terribly predictable story with jokes that not only come off as cringe-worthy to adults and teens, but can't even entertain children who are, y'know, THE TARGET AUDIENCE. I s&!t you not, the cinema I was in had about six rows filled (had gaps of course but besides the point) and each had a at least three kids in them. Not a single person uttered a word during this film or laughed, in fact the only thing that came out of someone's mouth was a collective groan from multiple members of the audience, a GROAN.

Not only was it funny and entertaining, but they did a great job making tribute to the earlier movies, and the classic 1960's show. It's got similar humor to them, and with the animation, is able to make jokes and stunts that you wouldn't, and couldn't, see in a live action set.Granted, some jokes fall flat, and the first half is waaaaay better than the second. It sort of just peters out once we start reaching the climaxes of the main dilemmas for the characters. And there are some things that I wish they did differently, but don't let all that, or the spoutings of biased haters, or even the short runtime stop you from at least going to the theaters on discount-Tuesdays to have fun with the whole family.I definitely plan on buying this on Bluray when it comes out.And the bonus is, now my wife is more eager to see ""Joker.""

In this Addams Family adaptation Morticia and Gomez flee their old home after being chased out by the townspeople. Now thirteen years later, they have started a new life in New Jersey, but a psychotic home improvement tv host wants them out. I started to become a fan of the Addams Family ever since the live action adaptation and I also explored the show that came out in the 60s too. And ever since then, I've become a fan of the Addams Family. But this adaptation I wasn't crazy for. The animation style they used for creating this family just didn't feel right as the animation style they did back then, truly felt like the Addams Family. But this animation felt like it was ripped off of Coraline. And this had so much potential, however I felt like the creators took three episodes from the 60s and crammed it into a ninety minute movie. And I know the message this movie was trying to make, but sadly it didn't stick the landing. And that's what I loved about the live action is that they actually got the Addams Family right and made them feel like a regular family.

could be a Halloween classic!, it has also got a look suppose and that it's animated....., again, so it sounds great and it could work in that Hotel Transylvania kind of way, with it's silly yet cartoony style, along with spooky visuals and humour so I'm all lol so the film came out on the 25th of October after the US got it two weeks ago, which makes sense since Addams Family is more popular in the US then it is over here, so I went to see it and..... it's pretty meh...., something that is considered a mixed bag, not good but not terrible either so let's talk about it.The Addams Family are considered creepy and kooky, mysterious and spooky and all together ooky, but none of them has ever been outside of the house they live in, so they all decide to check out this small town called ""Assimilation"", where they meet a lot of people and TV Host Margaux Needler (Alison Jenny) who gives them a warm welcome to their town, but is secretly trying to get rid of this family, meanwhile, Wednesday (Chloë Grace Moretz) wants to go to public school so she can fit in, while Morticia (Charlize Theron) is concerned about her safety and she wants her to stay at their home where it's more safer, meanwhile Gomez (Oscar Issac) teaches Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) the tradition of Mazurka and for him to show to the rest of his family... and that's it and what Vernon and Tiernan do here is.... all over the place, the plot is poorly executed with lots of cliches, it's very predicable from start to finish and the humour is not very effective, since it's has nothing to offer of value, although i did get a few chuckles, but not any full on laughs, not only that but the film is kind of boring at times, it never picks up in pacing and it just goes on and on, along with a questionable third act and ending, however I'll admit the first fifteen minutes of this film started off great, it has humour, quirk, that Halloween feeling and so much more, this is what I wanted from a film like this, but no we need conflict with the Addams Family and the humans, the writing and the directing here feels lazy, clueless, awkward and cliched, I know it's not supposed to be a original film but come on!...., this could of been better, with it's strong opening and decent humour, but then it just grinds to a halt and just becomes well..... generic and bland.The animation is okay at best, the designs of the family itself look good, all these characters look very Identifiable, they look weird but charmingly spooky, their house looks haunting and the inside is creative, so that stuff I liked, reminded of Smurfs: The Lost Village where the style is pretty close to it's source material, Thing Addams is pretty memorable in terms of designs and visual gags along with Lurch, even their cousins are awesome in terms of their quirky designs, so those are the only positives I can say about the animation... with that said, this is one of the most blandest, lifeless and average looking animated films I have ever seen, the humans look more creepy then the family do, they have that ugly cheap look to them, i get why they look like that but it looks like they are from a different film, like Parker and Margaux's design looks unprofessional, the backgrounds and the town it self look very dull and average, overall?, the animation is some of the laziest I have seen, it's pretty bad with a basic and dull look to it when it comes to the humans and their town, however I'll admit the stuff with the Addams Family is quite creative and memorable, so I guess the animation is just.... passable enough...The characters are not very memorable at all, there are like two maybe three characters that I remember being quite entertaining, the ones I really enjoyed where Thing and Lurch Addams, they had the best comedy, even though it's visual gags and such, but they were memorable and funny at least, I also like Wednesday, with her bored, deviously charming personality, she also made me laugh also and I was interested in whatever she was doing, Gomez and Morticia are fine, they do have good lines and humour but that's not saying much, Pugsley is purely annoying and his subplot is one there for the message of ""Being yourself"", which makes it more preachy then ever before, Fester is amusing enough but was there mainly as a comic relief, the Grandma is kind of the same also, Cousin It (Snoop Dogg.... seriously) is mostly just odd and minor, the idea of a strange cousin who only speaks in reverse could work and it can be funny, but since he is in the film for like two/three minutes, the comedy coming from him never grabbed me at all, as for Margaux Needler, who is the main antagonist of the film, she is very forgettable, bland and even confusing, she reminds me of Lou from Uglydolls if you think about it, her plan and even her fate is very questionable, Parker (Elsie Fisher) who is Margaux's daughter who is equally forgettable, however she is boring, bland, unfunny and her point in the film as Wednesday's new friend really doesn't offer a lot, however I can't say the same about the voice acting, it is really great!, I think Oscar Issac, Charlize Theron, Chloë Grace Moretz and Nick Kroll fit their characters quite well with their charm, delivery and humour, as for Finn Wolfhard as Pugsley, he doesn't sound any different as he does in real life, he sounds exactly like Ritchie, Snoop Dogg as Cousin It is just strange, but I think he's just there for a celebrity cameo and it's just a odd choice, these characters won't leave any impact on you, expect for Thing, Lurch, Wednesday and maybe Gomez and Morticia, everyone else you can forget easily, but since the voice acting is mainly awesome, it's not really the cast's fault that most of these characters are annoying and bland.On a side note, the rap song ""My Family"" is catchy and is pretty dope, but also laughably bad, but the score of the movie is decent at best I suppose.For someone who hasn't seen anything related to the Addams Family, this could of been a great start... however, it was only a medicore start and that's not a good film, the 2019 animated adaptation of the Addams Family is just another dull, bland, cliched, cheap looking and not very funny animated kids film, it does ha be okay animation, a few chuckles here and there and I do like a few characters and the voice acting is great!, however it suffers from a poorly executed story, with not very effective humour, bland, ugly and unprofessional animation, characters that offer very little and are forgettable, that and Snoop Dogg as Cousin It is just there for a celebrity camo, if you have a family or kids and if they want to just see something related to Halloween and kills some time with something that the kids will enjoy, this is.... fine, however if your looking for a good film of the Addams Family, you won't find it here, but apparently it worked, it was successful and it's getting a sequel......, to be honest... I don't get it, maybe it could be better...., but hey what do I know?, sequels are mainly there because of success, not to continue a story or do new things, nope, just money, this isn't awful as Queen's Corgi or PlayMobil: the Movie granted, but even I take the Angry Birds Movie 2 and Wonder Park over this, just watch the Hotel Transylvania trilogy and or even the Book of Life, they are so much better then this, this is one animated film I will easily forget in a few days...., however there is a certain Disney animated sequel that is on it's way and hopefully it won't let my expectations go...I'm afraid I'm going to gives the Addams Family a 4.2/10.",The Addams Family

121,Blazehgehg,Entirely forgettable,2,1 November 2020,"I can't get over what an ugly movie this is. The core Addams cast looks... fine, for the most part, but everyone and everything else about this movie looks like there was fantastic concept art that got totally mangled in to the wrong kind of horror show when converted to work in 3D CGI.A lot of that can also be blamed on the movie's production quality. Some scenes look great, but most of this movie scrapes the edges of something that's direct-to-video. The technical merits of this movie are few and far between, with bland lighting and clumsy scene direction. Compared to the gorgeous visuals of movies from Pixar, Dreamworks, or even studios like Sony Pictures Animation and Illumination, The Addams Family looks low budget.The real problem, though, is the writing. This is the most basic, predictable interpretation of The Addams Family perhaps ever committed. The lyrics claim they're ""mysterious"" and ""kooky"" but this Addams Family is downright pedestrian, where all of the gags can be boiled down to the an utterly flat ""opposite day"" punchline. But they just aren't weird enough, and the more the movie struggles to make them seem weird, the more it feels like it's trying too hard and going nowhere. There are a couple of good goofs every now and then, but they are rare. Mostly it's softball stuff like ""isn't having a pet lion just SO weird???""There's a story in here somewhere about accepting people for being different, but the movie does an extremely poor job conveying that message. Crucial character moments are spread too thinly (or never come at all), and problems seem to magically resolve themselves automatically without anyone meaningfully growing, changing, or learning anything about themselves. One by one, every conflict conveniently evaporates in a puff of smoke until the movie just ends.It sucks, in other words.

To say that the film is ruined by these political undertones of acceptance would be too harsh. The theme that people should accept each other is the primary theme of the movie and was very evident, but the film still could have found a way to be more subtle about it. It seemed that every other line was something about being yourself or accepting others. These are positive themes, but ultimately take away from the film that is supposed to be The Addams Family.

130,thomasmitilis1995,DON'T FORGET TO KICK YOUR FATHER GOODNIGHT...,4,30 April 2020,"The film is a harmless but forgettable retelling of the beloved family. This version depicts a clear message about embracing individuality and not devaluing people who look and behave a little different. The plot isn't coherent enough and the movie overall doesn't know where to focus on. Despite the good voice acting by Charlize Theron and Oscar Isaak, Morticia and Gomez are pushed completely to the background and their usual, weird interaction is non-existent in this version. The most interesting subplot is the one of Wednesday (Chloe Grace Moretz) as the rebellious teenager and the sequence in the public school is entertaining. On the other hand, the storyline with Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) is boring and underdeveloped. The design of the family members is very close to the original incarnations -plus Wednesday's noose hair is amazing- but the animation of the other people looks lazy. Margaux Needler (Allison Janey) as the villain is so stereotypical and her motivation of riding Addams out of town and controlling the city is unrealistic. Her sublplot only exists to illustrate the influence of the media and she doesn't face the consequences of her actions in the end. The jokes are mostly aimed towards children and only the darker humor lands (and the scene where the hand is watching feet in a laptop). The original musical theme is fantastic but the modernization of it in some points is irritating.",The Addams Family

They show us that they are not only them but as 50 relatives that without quite bizarre and in general this whole world/universe.

The film gets straight into the action & wastes no time getting on with the story, i quickly understood what was going on & the vibe for the rest of the film was set. There was multiple funny bits throughout the film which were funny but not eye watering, jaw dropping, falling off your seat funny, its not meant to be like that as the kids will just find stuff funny rather than really funny.I liked all the characters as they all seemed to fit in well in the film, especially Uncle Fester's character, i loved how the kids kept shooting arrows at him yet it does not bother him one bit. Also cool to see Snoop Dogg voice one of the characters.This film is not scary at all if you think its going to be scary for kids, it is acceptable for everyone.Overall it weren't bad as it was a laugh but would not watch again & again & its not one of those films you would remember for years to come.Age - 25

140,imjaredross,A Very Forgettable but Not Terrible Film,5,19 October 2019,"Now, right from the start before seeing this film I found myself very unimpressed with what I saw from this new animated Addams Family. I didn't like the animation style. I didn't like the comedy I saw in the trailers. Overall, I just didn't think it looked very good. But, I wanted to give it a shot anyway. I'm a fan of The Addams Family from the old series that I would watch as reruns on TV Land to the famous incarnations from the 90s. I love the macabre nature of the world and I love the characters. For the most part this new Addams Family gets that right.The characters we know and love are all present here and they're as macabre as ever, if not clearly toned down for younger audiences. This makes the film very much feel like a kids film, which of course it is. However, it plays itself safe, but fails to add much new to the table.The animation was a complaint I had before I even saw the film. Now, I understand the designs for the Addams Family are based of the only comic designs for these characters however, just do not think it works with this animation. I found the animation ugly and not just for the main characters but the supporting cast as well. It felt so inconsistent with each other you could tell it was 2 styles clashing with each other.Most of the comedy I found perfectly fine a serviceable. There aren't any laugh out moments and there's not much here for adults either, unless you have nostalgia for this family like I do. The one moment the film does become kind of fun is with a subplot where Wednesday wishes to go into the normal world. It got some middles chuckles from me, but nothing more than that. I also enjoyed moments toward the end of the film with the Addams extended family. It's the one moment the film does something that feels creative.Overall, The Addams Family is mostly bland and forgettable. It barely does enough to justify its existence and the only thing it has going for it is nostalgia for these wonderful characters. It's not a terrible film, but it's just meh.",The Addams Family
141,annahudak-70828,A family-friendly fun commentary on minorities in America,6,27 July 2021,"I'm like how this film shows a more human side of The Addams Family than in the 90's live-action films. While those were more entertaining due to generally just being more twisted and deranged, this film takes a different approach. It shows how strange and and times twisted The Addams Family can be, but it shows that at the end of the day, they are human (while the 90's did everything to show that they're not human, but ""Addams'"" instead). It shows how judgemental they can be, and also how scared they are. They are terrified of the outside world because of how they were treated in the past. The outside world wants to kill them, and Morticia and Gomez want to protect their kids from that, but wow it backfires hard. This film really does a good job of expressing the feelings of minority groups in today's America: very worried, very much under attack, but also hoping that maybe society is finally becoming more accepting. The most important part of this is ""Assimilation,"" which in this film is a literal town right next door. For minorities, like me, people, who often live right next door often want to force minorities to be just like the majority. They want to force black people to ""act white"" or look whiter with their hairstyles and fashion. They want gay and trans people to just be straight and cis-gender. They promote literal torture such as conversion therapy in hopes it will assimilate minorities to be like the majority. They just want everyone to act and look the same, like Ms. Needler who ran ""Assimilation,"" not caring about the toll it takes on minorities (or in this case, the Addams). Then, if the minorities refuse to assimilate, they must be gotten rid of, like Needler tried to do. There is nothing worse than minorities not only living, which is horrible enough, but minorities unabashedly being themselves and not hiding it at all. It shows how bigots claim that minorities are an ""infestation"" and trying to destroy ""our community"". The film didn't stop there. It also serves as a critique of the policing within minority communities, the belief that there's only one way to be black or trans and how damaging it is to those in those communities. How assimilation is something that even happens in minority groups. Another thing that the movie showed decently well is how hatred and bigotry is pushed on social media and it slowly ramping up. I didn't like how the movie implies that bigots can be changed as long as they have exposure to minorities and see their humanity. This is often not the case, but I understand that this is a kids movie, so they had had to have a happy ending.Also, the ""Hag Network"" gag was hilarious.",The Addams Family

144,dpg-87522,A disappoiting remake.,4,1 December 2019,"The Adams family are undoubtedly a group of classic characters, that any adult with a little culture should know them. Unfortunately, this movie does not do justice to these characters, this brings us the typical adventure that one of the children wants to explore, there he urges and that his parents do not leave it, blah, blah, blah, I just say that he prefers to keep a quite mediocre and repetitive story, something we have seen many times. First I would like to talk about the good thing about the movie, this would be that it has the typical jokes that will probably make you laugh, and that really the appearance of several characters could be said to be something original, and the characters do not lack so much personality in my opinion, and you really feel that the scriptwriters understood who each of the characters is, but they didn't know how to get much potential out of it. Now that is really all that I have to say, now let's start with the animation, this is not very good to say, I say we are in a year where the animation looks almost real (Toy Story 4), but Los Locos Adamas fails in that sense, and certainly some character designs are simply horrible. Those extremely thin arm designs are horrible, and visually unpleasant. Now the story is mediocre, it offers you nothing new, and it brings us the repeated lesson that we are all equal and we have to accept it, please I have seen that many times, the villain is the worst, it is boring, it is ridiculous , it is annoying, it really has nothing good and I saw it as a totally unnecessary element in the film, the worst of all is that in the end they let you keep your work despite what you did and it seems that nobody has any problem with that . When I say that the movie is repetitive, I mean that it is not very different from movies like transylvania hotel, monsters that hide from humans, but in the end everything goes well and humans accept monsters, and so they both live together . That's what I mean that this doesn't offer us anything new, you could say that the movie falls short, although they will probably get a second part, and then a third, and so on until the sequel turns from bad to detestable, but well that's just a guess. Something that I did not like at all, is that many things are so lazily convenient, for example, that the adams run over someone, and that by chance that someone was a zombie, and that he casually agrees to work for them without any problem, or that They seek a home hidden from humans, and that just appears an abandoned asylum in the form of a house, and so on. Well and that's all I have to say, because there is not much to say about this movie, in a nutshell The crazy Adams is a bad adaptation made with the only purpose of making money, with a boring story, jokes that maybe you make them laugh, a pretty bad animation but in the end these characters are a classic so that's why I have to take pity, 4/10.",The Addams Family

I think it was done quite well, the story is very generic, but it's done in an interesting manner.This is definitely a one time watch, I don't know why people are very negative these days, bashing a film makes them feel superior about themselves, I enjoyed it for what it is.

Outsourced software developers in Far East rendering lovely cgi to tell a story that is just plain rubbish and not worth your time or money. I took my 7 and 6 year old to this and their verdict was that it was just ok and not fun. I concur. It is rather insulting to think that this leaves the Hollywood factory with a seal of approval. Film makers - shame on you for ripping off hard working families. Please hire some better writers and if you can't make it work then park it and rethink rather than ploughing on. Unacceptable really as it cost me £70 🤑to take the family out to watch this rubbish. I give this 3 stars on account of the hard working folk who sweat to produce some great animation otherwise just a rubbish. 👎👎👎,The Addams Family

However, as a young adult, I was not in the least bit entertained. The story line was definitely created for children, depicting the importance of inclusion/acceptance and family bond.

The original Addams Family films were funny, dark in places, and showed a loving family, happily killing eachother off in a gloomy way. But the new Addams Family is bright, colourful, and has acting that nobody likes. It is a children's animation film, so there is no sign of blood. The film surprisingly has no sex, but there is mention of the act. No swearing is including in the film, only words 5 year old children would watch. But the film is funny in places, and has some good scenes that save the film, but the characters have changed and that upsets me. 7/10.",The Addams Family

174,TwoWhiteGirlsAndYen,Who are the Addams',1,8 December 2020,"Imma be quite honest, I did not go into this movie expecting it to be good. However, I was not prepared for the dumpster fire that it was. In all honestly it is basically showcasing the year to follow its release. In the live action movies that came out in the 1990s, Morticia and Gomez are relationship goals, they are infatuated with each other. However, this movie shows them getting hitched but you do not see their extreme love for each other. Their relationship with their children throughout the movie also irritated me as they are not as supportive as they were in the live actions.
Don't even get me started on Fester, while he isn't the brightest in the most recent live action films, he still has a character arc and contributes to the plot. This movie does not do him any justice as he just has bad one liners throughout.
While I know this is technically a kids movie, the creators completely disregarded the dark humor of the original. There is no mystery or spooky, the characters are nothing like they have been in previous versions.
If you want the charm of the Addams Family, do not watch this movie, it has too many flaws from the original source to where they paint the house pink in the end. Also Thing shows no sass throughout the movie which is highly disappointing. Stick to the live actions unless you want an extremely childproof version of the family that probably used most of their budget paying for the music than decent writing. 10/10 would not recommend.
A positive would be Wednesday's noose braids.",The Addams Family

177,nickrichardson-16919,POPCORN EMPIRE: The Addams Family,5,2 November 2019,"""The Addams Family is... not a disaster, but a missed opportunity. 5.5/10""The Addams Family is an animated adaption of the 1930's comic of the same name, featuring the voice acting talents of Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Nick Kroll, and more. While the movie does a fine job of reviving the quirky characters and macabre humor, the film strains itself too much to update the material, rather than leaning on its original charms.Warning: Spoilers Ahead!On a technical level, The Addams Family is solid. It looks good, it sounds good, and it's style feels unique. The characters are entertaining, and the voice acting is decent all around. Unfortunately, the plot is the anchor that really drags this film down.Featuring two separate subplots, with neither being very interesting, the movie keeps afloat when it focuses on the Family and their crazy antics. There's some amusingly dark humor for a children's movie, and I laughed here and there. It strongly feels like the writers struggled to string together the gags with a coherent plot.One story involves a reality TV star who wants to assimilate the entirety of Westfield, New Jersey (even the new name of the town is Assimilation) for her own profit, including the Addams Family mansion. She also controls the population through social media, manipulating them to do her bidding. The second, less interesting subplot involves a coming-of-age ritual called a Mazurka, which Pugsley struggles to prepare for. These two stories clumsily come together in the final act, where the movie goes off the rails and becomes a mess.There's simply too much pandering to children in an attempt to be modern and relevant, including lots of references to smart phones and social media. By introducing ""regular people"" into the mix, the movie gets bogged down in pointing out the ways Addams Family are different, instead of enjoying those differences. There isn't much to be said for any deeper social commentary. The film does try to hammer home simple be-yourself and don't-judge-others-for-being-different type lessons, but it's all executed in a very obvious way, and you've seen the same stuff in countless other children's movies.For a movie that speaks so proudly about individualism and uniqueness, the Addams Family is a decidedly bland and sanitized children's movie. Had it let itself be free of the trappings of modern culture, and dug in more to the macabre, gothic weirdness of the source material, It would have been much more appealing. As it stands, it's not a disaster, but a missed opportunity.5.5/10",The Addams Family

180,sophialorraine19,Fun but definitely for children,7,3 October 2020,"I love the Addams Family. The original TV series, the 90's movie series, and the original 1930's comics. I know all there is to know about the Addams Family. Trivia, differences between series, movies, and other variations. So, I didn't not enjoy this version. I'll always enjoy something Addams Family.However, this is really made for children only. It's not even really for the entire family. I guess it can be but I feel most adults won't really be entertained. Honestly, most people above the age of 11 wouldn't really be entertained. I think younger children will 🖤 it and it may be a good gateway to the other adaptations. Especially cause you can show this movie to a much younger audience, like children under the age of 6. So, I still think it's worth watching.I also like the way they did the whole backstory of the old country and before the children were born. It varies from the series version but the 90's movie series changed so much of what the 60's TV series had originally set as backstories and family lines that I don't it really matters what they decided to change in this movie. It's their version of Addams Family and that's fine and fun for children. The best part of the movie was the visual aspect of the movie. The visual representation definitely reminded me a lot of the 1930's comics with modern twist. Because it was animated they were also able to pull off a lot that they would have never been able to do in a live action movie. So, that was something that made the movie more enjoyable.Watch and enjoy and if you have young monsters at home this is perfect for them.",The Addams Family

Don't expect political correctness from this film though. The sinister comic nature of the original cartoons are on full display in this hilarious movie. They may have pulled their punches on some of the material to make it acceptable for small children but in our less than perfect modern world it doesn't really show.The delightful scene when Wednesday resurrects the frogs in her biology class and then commands them to attack the irritating class queen bee with a pod people screech nearly had me falling on the floor in laughter.

192,libby-75255,The Lorax of The Addams Family,2,24 October 2019,"This movie reminded me so much of the 2012 version of The Lorax. It was a bland, uninspired rehashing of something we all know and love, created for the sole purpose of making money. With the same run of the mill ""family friendly"" animation we've all seen a hundred times. It even smashes you over the head with it's lesson in the same way.First of all, the characters are beyond ugly. Morticia and Lurch were the only ones who looked decent and Gomez was the worst of all. In a movie where everything else is bland and washed of originality seeing random characters who looks that gross and greasy is nothing less than a shock. At first I thought it was to contrast the pretty plastic people in town, but many of them look just as hideous as the Addams family,Second of all, the message. Honestly the fact that they took the ""be yourself"" message and included the Addams family themselves in it was a nice twist, instead of having the towns people be the only bad guys. However it's difficult to appreciate that when the only reason the towns people ever show up is to drill the point home, they literally sing a song with the lyrics ""why be yourself when you can be just like every body else!"" if you couldn't tell, subtly is not this movies strong point.Third, the jokes were boring, they were the exact same LOOK HOW WACKY THIS FAMILY IS which is alright but when it's the only joke the movie knows how to tell it gets boring. Also there was a really weird foot fetish joke thrown in that made no sense. I only laughed once in the whole movie and that was because they made a joke about divorce that came out of nowhere and it surprised me.Fourth, Snoop Dog. Who was in the movie as cousin IT however his voice is jumbled and pitched up, so you can't tell it's him unless you know already. That just makes it so much clearer that they only called him in to have his name on the box and make more money.And lastly, the song that played at the end credits was atrocious, it sounded like an old Pitbull song, which if you couldn't tell, doesn't exactly fit the Addams family too well.Overall the movie is harmless and if you need to shut a kid up for a couple hours this should do the trick.

It actually seems more appropriate as a movie pilot for a new children's show than it does for a movie.The people who created this obviously had a lot of love for the property, and seemed to have fun with it, which translates well to the screen. But coupled with the thin plot and less than stellar design, there is a lot to be desired.One bright spot was the first 10 minutes, which served as a sort of an origin story for the clan.

205,DanielNeil1237,Very average animated film with a few good moments,4,20 October 2019,"The Addams family 2019 is a very run of the mill animated film that ends up feeling very average.
Being a major fan of The Addams Family from the original films from the 90s I was really disappointed with the film. Our story follows the entire Addams family years after they have moved into their mansion being hidden there for years after being chased away by angry civilians. Now since to a new house flip tv show, they are discovered with the show host wanting to destroy their house to make it fit in with the neighborhood. On top of that Pugsly Addams is having to prepare to do a famous sword pattern that is a tradition to prove he is truly an Addams. In front of the entire Addams family and all their relatives. This subplot with Pugsly is one of many there is even another one about Wednesday Addams trying to fit in at school becoming an issue with the film having too many subplots. The main message of the film is one we have heard 100 times with accepting people in your town who are different because we are all unique in our own ways. This is a good message for kids but the message is shoved in way too much, and they don't reinvent the presentation of the message in any way, or try anything new to make it more interesting. I thought the film never fully did the characters justice especially the family relationship aspect. It had a few great performances that being Chole Grace Moretz as Wednesday Addams and Charlize Theron as Morticia Addams. Some of the imagery can be pretty cool with the house, using the character designs from the original comic strip and some scenes have good humor. Major issues with the film are in the story being extremely basic and not taking many risks. With like I mentioned earlier way too many subplots that can be extremely uninteresting. Overall The Addams family ends up being just okay with a few good moments sprinkled throughout but having an extremely basic story and not going all the way with the family's classic humor, dark style.",The Addams Family
206,cjfarley-65939,Changed my mind on this one.,8,6 January 2020,"I didn't like this movie at first. It's obviously a kid's movie, but I am a huge fan of the Addams Family. I grew up watching reruns of the original TV show, watched the animated series, had a couple of paperback reprints of the newspaper strip collections. I watched the live action movies as an adult and still watch them when I have the opportunity. At first, it seemed like this movie was missing the mark on the spirit of the Addams Family. I don't remember any of the other incarnations feeling they were different or odd. Initially it seemed this incarnation were aware they were considered monsters. This was toned down as the movie progressed. It also looked like it was going to be an origin story. Why is Hollywood so obsessed with erasing any mystery a character might have? I don't want to know Han Solo's back story and I don't want to know Gomez's either. Sometimes leaving someone mysterious is just more fun. Fortunately that was just a tiny piece of the movie. I almost stopped there, but decided to watch a little more. I am glad I did because the movie kind of smoothed out and to my surprise was funny and charming. I enjoyed it quiet a bit.",The Addams Family

211,taddycat,Dreadful,4,28 October 2019,"I love all things scary, strange and halloweeny. I was looking forward to this cartoon of The Addams Family. I liked the series. I loved the movies. We decided to take our son to this the day after it came out.About twenty omitted into the show, I was about ready to leave. I couldn't decipher what the plot was except for Pugsley's show he had to put on. The voices were off. Gomez went from a charismatic and likable man to an idiot with a Mexican accent. Not sure where they got that because Gomez wasn't Mexican. He was drawn terribly. Fester was a copy of Curly from The Three Stooges. His voice and mannerisms were the same. He was a babbling fool whose nose would jiggle. Just lazy drawing and writing.Morticia had zero personality. Her monotone voice was a bore. And how dare Charlize Theron, womens champion, ever play a role where the woman had to be submissive to a man!Wednesday wasn't cute, strange or morbid. Pugsley had more screen time than I would've anticipated. The beginning scenes of him trying to murder his father were contrasted by the loving relationship seen in the past mediums.I found the other characters to be stereotypical garbage not worth going into.The movie itself is a bit hard to follow. Every pun that is said gets its own little scene. These add up quickly and you're left swimming in a puddle of
Goo and trying to figure out what is the main plot of the movie. Too many tangents and side scenes complicate the already watered down storyline to basically nothing. What I was able to piece together was Pugsleys storyline and a woman who is selling real estate who wants the Addams' out.The Addams were always known as a likeable and somewhat relatable bunch. They had their quirks but they loved each other. This drivel doesn't really show that. It gets lost in itself while trying to be funny, didn't work though, and the side scenes.I wouldn't even rent this one on Redbox. And before you persecute me for tearing down a kids movie, look, lots of these movies are targeted to families and not just children. But to add, my son only found it remotely entertaining.Just junk.",The Addams Family
212,ihasnochille,Should have actually been a family film,6,5 December 2019,"If you ever wanted to see the difference between a kids film and a family film this is it.
Nothing inherently feels 'wrong' or 'bad' about the film, yet it just constantly felt off. I love the Addams family and was ready to get into it but it just never properly grabbed me. This is due to the films child focused approach.
The problem is a child's film can only really be enjoyed by a child while a family film can be enjoyed by all ages. And if i'm being quite frank they really should have gone the family route.
I feel the Addams family as a franchise thrives in the 'family friendly' genre, I mean family is in the name!
And yet here we are with a dumbed down children's film that almost none of the original fans of the Addams family can truly enjoy because of their age.
It feels like such a missed opportunity, it could have been so close to greatness but it just restricts itself to such a small demographic it falls short.
Really, only see this if you have a small child that you think might enjoy it, if you are and old fan, there is not much here for you.",The Addams Family

218,realchasek,"It wasn't the best, but it's manageable.",5,12 October 2019,"I was walking in not knowing what to think, because it got a lot of mixed reviews. I came out thinking both were right.
So there are kind of three plots. The main one is that there is a woman who wants to ""fix up"" The Addams Family house for her TV show, but The Addams don't want her to, so she makes up rumors about the Addams and tries to destroy their house.
The second one is that Wednesday starts to attend a normal Junior High school. When she starts to hang out with a girl named Parker, the daughter of the woman who has a TV show, she starts to want to be like a standard girl. And Parker wants to be emo and dark. They both sorta end up doing so.
The third plot is that Pugsley is old enough for an Addams family passing-of-age event involving swords, but he dosen't want to do it.
All three plots blend together pretty well. In the end Gomez (Pugsley and Wednesday's dad) accepts that Pugsley should do it his own way and not just by tradition. Wednesday decides to be herself again. The woman with the TV show tries to demolish their house but after everybody finds out how evil she is they cancel her TV show, and Parker decides to be an Addams? It was confusing, I'm not sure if she stayed with them or whatever, it wasn't specified.
That's the end.
The animation isn't great, most of the civilians are creepier than the Addams themselves. The story is generic, like I've seen it before but I can't recall where or when. The jokes are mostly unfunny, but a few of them got a laugh out of me.
Overall, if you're like me and haven't seen anything related to The Addams Family before this, probably give it a skip. But maybe a The Addams Family fan would appreciate it more than me.",The Addams Family

This is NOT one of those films. The Addams Family movie is definitely geared towards children up to about 12 years old. There is absolutely NOTHING clever or even remotely entertaining about the comedy in the movie; at least not for an adult audience. I'm sure my ten year old found it entertaining, as well as his group of six friends we also took to see the movie today, but I must admit, not a single one of them so much as even mentioned the movie after seeing it. Usually we leave the theater with them chatting about what they just saw. Not this time. As for me and my wife, we were both pretty disappointed. I mean, it's the Addams Family for goodness sake, but unfortunately it seemed as if it was not only written for ten year olds, but also written by ten year olds. All these positive reviews on here raving about what a great movie it is, must be paid to say such things.

229,ronaldnewmandierector,The Addams Family: Interesting,7,11 October 2021,"The Addams Family. Where to start? The casting was great. They got a number of stars from Oscar Isaac (Who did a great job with the accent), Finn Wolfhard, Snoop Dogg, Allison Janney and more. While I didn't find it extremely funny the humor used is more suited for younger children. While I did find some things funny like the Addams hiding out in New Jersey because ""nobody would dare to venture there"" the overall humor was mediocre. The plot was interesting. An evil real estate agent and neighborhood owner tries to steal the Addams house because it ruins the view of her ""perfect"" neighborhood where everyone is the exact same. The ending truly caps off an interesting story. Evil turns good, monsters and humans live in harmony (for now) and the Addams and their extended family find a way to live near each other and keep themselves busy. I haven't seen the original Addams family at the time of this being posted but I do plan on watching it. Good job to Matt Lieberman for the screenplay. The only reason it's seven stars for me is because the humor is lacking for some age groups, and it just doesn't get you in the Halloween mood.",The Addams Family

The whole accept-everyone-propaganda was terrible. They didn't even try to hide it. The villain's daughter, Parker, is terrible as well. I hated every minute of her screen time.

From the start, the movie captures the audience with a creepy, yet, fun and entertaining vibe. The characters are very stilized, and the movie is presented in a very artistic way, which I really liked. From what I remember of the original characters, the portrayal in this movie was parallel to the personalities we all know and love. I would recommend this movie to anyone, young or old, fan or not. Its a perfect movie to go watch on Halloween!!The jokes are funny, the characters really connect with you, and you cant help but feel like you want to help the Adams family fit in with society.

241,ashaleymorrison-58882,Not the Addams Family at all.,1,8 July 2020,"There was glimpses in the film that reminded me of the traditional Addams family. But truly the entirety of this film tried way too hard & completely missed the mark. It was extremely cringey & upsetting for anyone who grew up with the traditional Addams family. From the soundtrack to the film which was absurdly pop-y & so obviously forced into the film to reach the younger generation. To the voice actors chosen, Chloe Grace is too bubble gum & you could feel how awkward & forced it was for her to voice someone out of her range, Charlize Theron who constantly applied peaks & valleys during her lines that made Morticia seem stuck up & judgmental, Issac as Gomez was a plain flop, Finn as Pugsley was too ""leave it to beaver"", but Nick Kroll did fantastic as Uncle Fester. The voice actors chosen were sadly picked to be a star cast to bring in their large, mainstream fan base but they are typecast actors at their core. The plot of of the film being Wednesday wanting to go mingle & meet with the people in the city far below but couldn't because her parents are being controlling over her to never leave their home because their criticized for being monsters sounds too familiar. Because it is. This plot for an ""angsty"" teen girl to go against her parents has been over done & was most recently done in the first film of the Hotel Transylvania series. When in other Addams Family medias, they are portrayed as individuals who applaud differences & are confident in who they are that they don't want or need to hide. No Addams thinks they're above any other Addams, like the one ancestor judging Pugsley for his monster barmitzvah. Deeply disturbed by the Addams allowing their house to be painted pink because the most cited quote from Morticia is that black is such a happy color. If anything, instead of doing a played out children's theme for the movie, I would've enjoyed it more if they took a plot idea from one of the episodes from the original series to build a movie around. I appreciated the animation style to match Charles Addams original New Yorker style & grandmama being Gomez's mother like it was originally vs being Morticia's in later medias. I also appreciated the ending scene doing the exact intro sequence for the 1964 tv show, that was a good nod to the show. But the mark was sadly so missed, if they took more time to establish a better soundtrack that fit the Addams family, picked voice actors based on talent that properly suited the Addams family & what they stand for (not because of their fame or relevancy at the time), & created a plot that followed the morals & values of the Addams family that wasn't so cheesy, forced & absolutely incorrect with the Addams family nature, then they would've done great. And if you're questioning the validity or nature of the the reviewer, this is a review from a girl who as a child idolized Wednesday Addams & wanted to be her when she grew up, never a Disney princess.",The Addams Family

In the past, the Addams Family were this weird, 'opposite day' type of household, that would never hold up in real life. Or would it? There is only one factor that was never changed, and that stuck in the back on my head. In the middle of that chaos, of that muddy, dusty, creepy way of life, we had two incredibly charming characters: Gomez, a very handsome, athletic and well spoken husband, and Morticia, an incredible sight to look at, stylish, and also very intelligent. They were constantly absorbed by each other, and for good reasons. The way they were, made them a powerful influence in their universe, and thus, making sense for such a way of life to exist. And I never realized this until I saw the trailer for this new one. Everything seems ok, except the one detail that could've saved it (for me). Gomez looks like a short, fat businessman, a microwaved version of what he used to be, and Morticia looks like she smells of stale cigarette smoke and casino stools. In addition, Wednesday's head looks like she is Fester's daughter, instead of a young boy's dream.",The Addams Family

254,alisaadlerwl,"Funny cartoon, which calls to serious topics",10,3 December 2019,"Sorry If I have some mistakes in the text, English is not my native.Out of question, it's the best of films I've seen lately. A bunch of qualitative jokes, an excellent picture, unusual characters, a logical plotline. Megascopic textile and skin looks like real. Yeas, sometimes cartoon is naive, but it's a cartoon after all! Meanwhile, the important idea of freedom of choice is touched; the idea of courage to be yourself even if a family doesn't like it.So I was actually surprised having seen the pretty average rating of the film. The Russian Governmental newspaper has even published the slashing critique with a headline: 'About freaks and submen'. Judging by this heading, the author didn't like personages. Well, It's a matter of taste. For example, I'm getting sick of 'Interstate 60', even though many people adore it. Also I suspect, that people unconsciously compare the cartoon with the films about Addams family. Or the film, I don't know, how many of them exist. I watched only one, and don't remember much of it, so comparison couldn't spoil my impression.Claims like 'Humor there is childish' seem not clear to me. At the same time others tell humor was too adult, so this point looks controversial. As if there is some manual, which let's to distinguish 'adult' and 'childish' humour. I think it would be useful to consider an adult humor anything marked 18+. For example, with an obvious sexual connotation. 'Adams' actually doesn't have anything like that. And also there are no jokes with farting, like in the 'Interstate 60' There is a touching grotesque, unusual world-image of heroes, unusual context of common family problems, which are well-known to many of us. But we are serious adult people and want a serious humor in the cartoon, whatever it means.By the way, talking about family conflicts, there are several lines of them. So I would surely recommend to watch the film with a family. And besides family values and idea of freedom I liked one more hint of the film, which is not discussed there openly: we all are freaks a little. We all have thoughts and habits which can shock the person, who lives a different way. And it's foolish to reproach people who are not like everybody else.

It pays tribute to the Addams Family tv shows, movies, and comics of the past whilst bringing several new twists. Very well done. As a fan of the 1960's tv show I was concerned as to how it would go but I am pleasantly surprised. The animation style is based on the original comic strip. Wednesday is played similar to Christina Ricchi's version in the 90's movies. The rest of the family are exactly as the 60's black and white versions except for lurch who has a new spin to his character. I really appreciated the effort taken to pay tribute to all the renditions of the Addams Family. It was good to see it wasn't just a remake or a sequel but a good blend of old and new.",The Addams Family

271,amaescabusa,A Pleasant Surprise,8,16 October 2019,"If you have seen any previews for this movie, then you should know that it's a far more simple take on The Addams Family, and is clearly geared towards kids. The jokes in the trailer didn't quite land for me, but I was excited to see this movie anyway, because I love when new kid friendly Halloween movies come out. I wasn't expecting to love this movie, but I did! The plot was basic, predictable, and nothing to rave about. It has been done before. But the script was actually really well written, in my opinion! If you pay attention, there are lots of little nuggets that pay homage to other versions of The Addams Family. There are also so many fun jokes! Some are clearly geared more towards kids, and some are definitely for the adults. The script is basically joke after joke. Of course with that many jokes, they aren't all going to be winners, but the movie made me audibly chuckle... more than once! I rarely do that in a movie. If you want a fun, family friendly, ""spooky"" movie, with bits of great comedy, and a good moral message, then why not go see it?! It's not brilliant by any means, but I absolutely loved it anyway! Just appreciate it for what it is! Don't expect it to be an exact remake of an old take on it, or to be an award winning movie with a deep and twisted plot. Accept and embrace the simplicity, and I guarantee you will enjoy this movie. Ignore the critics! It's a fun movie for what it is!!!",The Addams Family

If you have never seen the Addams Family before I suppose it's entertaining but as somebody who grew up with the Charles Addams cartoons, the TV show and the movies I'd have to rate it as a good try but an over-all fail. The characters are (mostly) right out of the cartoons so first impression is it's going to be an animated version of them but that impression doesn't last too long. The reason is that suddenly they are doing scenes from the live movies. No, they are doing scenes from the TV Show. No, it's a goofy parody of scenes from other live-action movies. No. It's a rip-off of Pixar movies, No and so on. I don't know what it is!I want to be fair. If you have never seen the Addams Family before then I suppose it's a good entertaing and fun movie. If you *have* seen the TV show and movies then pretend you have never seen them before seeing this one.The closing scene was an excellent animation of the opening from the TV show using the animated characters. All they missed (I think) was that sweet little smirk that Morticia (Carolyn Jones) did during her second finger snap. That one section alone deserves 9.5 stars. Maybe she did make the smirk and I missed it so make that scene 10 stars instead.",The Addams Family

The gloom vs day-glow pink of the Adams vs Town theme is is visually arresting. But give me the pallid pallet of the Addams world any day. From Wednesdays pale visage to the mist shrouded skeletal trees of the the surrounding hillside... this is a gloomfest to die for.

I laughed at maybe two or three jokes, and it was more like a short snort than an actual laugh. My sister is 11 and she found the film tedious to say the least; halfway through it she asked me if we could leave. It was boring and it had way too much boomer humor for me or my sister to enjoy it.Despite all of that and some of the more awkward moments (there were cameras everywhere? and they decided to talk about how this lady uses her private toilet?), some characters are hard to dislike, even if they're written a little OOC (e.g.: Wednesday).All for all, I wouldn't watch it again but if your kid is around, I don't know, maybe five (and doesn't have the capacity to distinguish good and bad animations), they would.",The Addams Family

That even if your family is different they are still family. and the cookie cutter mom and the popular girl are the real monsters so worried about!
Let's talk about all the nods. The lion, the fact that they painted the house pancakes and not to the original series. The creators of the original black and white had to have the interior of the house entirely pink because it translated in black and white best.
I judged this movie you very harshly and honestly have nothing bad to say about it. As the weird goth girl myself I absolutely love this movie.

306,ultimateboredbrains,"Ignore you're looking for the Addams, don't watch this.",2,27 June 2020,"As much as I can say that I enjoy some aspects of this movie. I struggle connect it to the original two movies. (The Addams family, and the Addams family values) they're nothing alike aside from the rough idea of the characters. Odd balls in a normal society. But it feels so strange to see someone like Finn Wolfhard playing Pugsley. I know the actor from IT, in which he plays a very different character. Which I'll take into account that he can act. But seeing him play what I've always known as a mumbling idiot. (Nothing against Pugsley. He was one of my favourite characters in fact.) There's also Nick Kroll. Who, maybe it's me personally, I don't like in most of his roles. He was fantastic in his performance and he was also amazing in what we do in the shadows (2019) but seeing him play another one of his 'Man child' characters as uncle Fester just annoys me. Uncle Fester was always a bit of an idiot, I know that, but never was he used as only a comedic puppet. He actually did things that weren't comedic in some parts of the movies. Such as when he was arguing with his 'mother' in the original. He was actually angry. And not 'haha I'm annoyed' if that makes any sense.If we move on from my problems with the cast and onto one of my worst gripes about the movie, the idea. The original movie was about a family who were content with living in their house, knew about the outside world and stayed in their home by choice. In this film it's extremely obvious that they've got no knowledge of the outside. For gods sake, they didn't know what a balloon was! They weren't idiots, just odd. In this they're practically mouth breathing, dribbling babies. Then there's the scene where Uncle Fester is in the town square singing. I've got one question. How didn't he know that a flurry of bats would scare the townspeople? They've seen people before, they know that what they normally do scares people. So why didn't he choose anything else to do you might ask. Because it's a children's movie. And children's movies aren't supposed to make sense. Unless we count the original Addams family which, again, did everything this movie tried to do but better and without copying movies like 'Hotel Transylvania' and other such.Which swiftly brings us into my next point, and my final one. It copy's other movies. I'm sure if you've seen this movie you've seen hotel Transylvania. In which, a bunch of oddballs move to a secluded mansion just to find that one of their children is curious of the outer world and meets a 'normal' person. They get along very well. See anything familiar? I've just described the plot of The Addams family (2019) as well. How odd am I right? It's my personal opinion that the film makers saw the popularity of this movie and wanted to make their own. So took a classic from years ago, and warped it beyond what is respectful. Changing the plot to match Hotel Transylvania to an unreasonable level. This is not going to be a coincidence. And I will take that 'it's similar but quite different' but if someone tells me this is a coincidence I don't know what I'm supposed to say in response. Because that's just false.So in conclusion. If you're looking for The Addams family, don't watch this movie. But if you're looking for a kids movie that's will make young kids laugh, then go ahead. If not it's not worth a watch. Don't make the mistake I made, and don't watch this movie unless you've got actual reason to.",The Addams Family

310,emailaddress-61401,Not for me.,3,28 November 2020,"So this movie happened. I am not the biggest fan of this movie (my rating shows this). The animation is ugly. It could definitely be worse, but could also be much better. The story is partly focused around the ""Sabre Mazurka"". I am a fan of the original series, since I found it while scrolling through Prime. I do not recall it being in the original series, and played a smaller role in the old movie. Here, it is a huge event. Gomez tries to train Pugsley for it, but Pugsley fails. Then they decide to throw a random message about being who you are. This theme IS present throughout the older installments in the series. However, they had nowhere to put it, so they decided to throw it in, VERBALLY, I might add, in that scene. The ""villain"", is this lady that runs a tv show. She wants everyone to buy a house in a fake town that she built, which is located nearby the Addams. They are ruining her town by existing, so she tries to get the house destroyed. We find out that she more of a psychopath than we thought, and that she is spying on everyone in the town. Then everything's all cheery and happy again. Yay? Somethings really don't make an ounce of sense, like how her hair Just STANDS UP by itself (idk why this irritates me so much), how they built the houses in the swamp so quickly, why those NEW houses have doors that can only be locked/unlocked from the OUTSIDE, and how easily people are convinced. Yes, there are people like this, but it is GREATLY exaggerated.

311,rangerglenn,"Falls totally flat, horrible animation.",2,30 November 2020,"All I can figure is that whomever developed this film has never seen the TV Show or previous films. The Addams Family was a great group of individuals that lived in their home and were quite happy with who they were, often totally unaware that they were different. This adaptation ignores nearly all of what we know (and love) about the Addams' and instead depicts them as a poor family that only wants to fit in with the normals. No joke...I feel asleep twice and laughed maybe once.Gomez is a sloppy fat humpty dumpy looking fella that they attempted to pass off as the swave lanky father we know and love. Pugsley is the little nerdy outcast that plays with explosives and wants to be accepted by his family. Wednesday must have been the last one they animated, and it shows. Shes an egg shape on top of a couple cylinders. A first semester animation student could do better. Lurch is an escaped mental patient (???) who spends his time playing modern pop music and some how happens to create the familiar addams family tune. Morticia is perhaps the most recognizable but has tentacles for feet? (What the hell?)The whole story revolves around a psycho HOA president character that wants to provide interior design services to help make them more normal. An idea that the family actually entertains briefly. The fact that Gomez and Morticia are chased away from their wedding by pitchfork weilding townsfolk and flee to thier current home makes it all the more unbelievable that they would entertain ideas from this HOA freak. Speaking of their house....it isn't even theirs. Its an abandoned building that they just move into.Ugg....the whole film is just a nightmare.",The Addams Family

I recommend it to anyone whom is a fan of the series or enjoys spooky comedies. There's a couple of problems with it, as nothing is 100% perfect.The scenes that take place in the plasticy-looking town of Assimilation are barren save for areas directly around where the characters are in the setting. A few times we see cars in the background, but the place is desperately lacking in extras. The writing with the Addams parents & children relationships that serves as a portion of the story's conflicts is unfaithful to the characters & may piss off some fans.

Wednesday spends the movie trying to impress her friends, while Pugsly trains for some sort of ceremony involving swords. I'm not sure how children are expected to follow all of the storylines; I had trouble as an adult lol. The storylines don't intertwine much until the end where Wednesday's friend's mom turns the town against the family because they're too weird for her ideal town. Pugsly's storyline doesn't really serve a purpose other than character development between him and his father. Otherwise, Pugsly's character is made to be pretty unlikeable, consistently almost murdering his family members. This trope happens often throughout the movie. Along with having a messy, thrown-together storyline, the animation style is pretty ugly. The ""normal"" members of the town look freakier than the Addams family members because of the crazy proportions the animators chose to use. The main antagonist's hair is bigger than her body, and her daughter is scarier-looking than Wednesday. The main way that the movie separates the Addams family from the normies is by dressing normies in bright colors, while the Addams family wears all black. Overall, the movie seemed lazy. You can tell the writers were kinda just like ""it's for kids, so just write whatever"".",The Addams Family
315,KPlan,More Addams than previous Addamses,9,18 October 2019,"When critics all dislike a movie, it's usually because the film is simply not technically a well-made film. Poor structure, flat directing or choppy editing, perhaps stilted dialogue or performances. ADDAMS does *not* suffer from any of that. The film's 3 screenwriters EXPERTLY combined the original ""Chas"" Addams New Yorker cartoons w/the '60s TV series AND the live-action movies. And, unlike the live movies (which cheaped out on licensing fees), it uses the famous theme song (in full!) and even COMPLETELY & perfectly re-creates its famed opening.The story opens on the wedding of Gomez & Morticia, who soon find themselves on the run for being ""monsters""; this leads into them running into, and meeting for the first time, Lurch. We soon fast-forward a number of years where the main plot revolves around Pugsley reaching the age where he becomes a man (and, for Jewish audiences, you'll appreciate the joke that has him ""reading from the Terror!""). Having the plot revolve around Pugsley is not something we've seen yet, so that was a nice change of pace from previous Addams film incarnations.The movie is definitely kid-friendly, but in the theater I saw it in, while the MANY children present remained quiet throughout (a tell-tale sign of a good kids movie -- the same quiet did NOT happen when I saw Shazam or Spider-Man:FFH), it was the adults who were laughing the hardest. There are a LOT of jokes and gags that will pass you right by -- no, the theme of the movie (being different is OK!) is NOT subtle, but many of the jokes are. However, there are so many at such a rapid-fire pace, if you miss one, you'll get the next two. The film also manages to stay in character, something the Sonnenfeld live-action movies (which I also loved) could not manage to do (for example: Thing working at FedEx or many of the interactions with Fester and Gomez). Overall, it's a kid-friendly but still macabre take on the Addamses. Far, FAR superior to the Broadway incarnation, and a lovely ode to the cartoons and '60s series. Ignore the inexplicably angry reviews. Go see it.",The Addams Family

323,kpeter3205,Tim Burton......where are you?,3,26 January 2020,"This film have been much better received had Tim Burton direct. I grew up loving ""The Addams Family"", not so much the sitcom, but rather Charles Addams books. His creation has been watered down that it's hard the recognize, much less respect. I was very much looking forward to this film when it was announced because I thought it was going to be a throwback to the original illustrations, not only in style, but tone. The tone was completely lost. It might have been ok for a five year old, and most likely that was the target, but for characters that have a huge fan base, it's unwise to ignore and disregard the population that actually supports these films... the adults. I will NOT watch another one if these unless Burton is attached with creative control.",The Addams Family

327,daimon22,The Sleeping Family,1,9 January 2020,"The most boring and lame animated ""remake"" off all time . Isn't about how the actors performed giving voice to the characters , it is the script / plot itself .... cheap , lack of ideas , lack of inspiration and originality.... wasted 90 minutes for nothing , hoping that something will happen and I really struggled to stay awake in the meantime.",The Addams Family
328,fallenstar1225,Lacking heart and kook,3,14 October 2019,"This movie completely lacks the heart and spirit of the original movies and tv series. It's scarcely funny and the plot is just too complex for the target audience. In a movie theater full of children I heard more ""can we go home?""s than I heard laughter.Honestly. It's a no from me",The Addams Family
329,jdiazpimentel,Boring!!!,1,21 October 2019,"I loved Adams family but this movie version is very boring. I didn't like the flat storyline. The end was rushed and highly predictable.

330,tomgar-767-476756,"Horrible, awful, boring. Run.",1,8 December 2019,"I've got three kids and have sat through my fair share of mediocre movies throughout the years. Nothing prepared me for this. My seven year old had seen the trailer and, he said, wasn't motivated for Frozen 2, the only other kids movie showing. The cinema was full of eager patents and ready-to-laugh kids. But no laughter was to be heard. Nothing. An hour and a half of absolute boredom. Without a doubt it was the worst movie I have ever seen in a cinema in all categories. It was just worse than boring. It was painful. Please, if you are reading this, maybe sitting on the fence, save your money for something else. You have been warned. This was my first ever movie review - that's how horrible it was.",The Addams Family

334,zombiepooh666,"If only Tim Burton had made it,,,,",3,3 April 2020,"Focuses to much on fitting in! What made the Addams Family great was they didn't fit in & they didn't try to fit in with the 'Normals'! Some of the jokes are funny on a child level.
Would have been much much better if Tim Burton made it!
Maybe it's because I grew up watching reruns of the tv series & from the first time I watched it I loved it & wanted them to be my family. This just doesn't have the spooky,,kooky,,vibe that is the Addams Family!",The Addams Family
335,alvaromkt,An amazing revival of the Addams Family,9,31 October 2019,"Dont get confused. This is an amazing animated movie for all ages, especially for adults. I think people is so used to Disney and Pixar kind of animation that they don't really enjoy this film and have a really hard time trying to get it.
It's a different kind of story and humor, but it even has a message. The animation is amazing, there are details everywhere. It's genuinely smart, funny and entertaining.
Give it a chance, enjoy as a film and don't expect to see a classic animated story from princesses and fairy tale.",The Addams Family

339,jennysmassage,Not the Addams!,2,20 January 2020,They should have just gave them a new name considering this is an entirely new family! They are not like the old movies from the 90s or the tv show from the 60s. The characters kinda sucked too. Super let down. The voices were clear and the animation was good so it gets 2 stars.

345,igorneox,This didn't need to exist. Nobody needed it.,4,25 December 2019,"The animation overall is OK, but I didn't like any of the character designs (the Hand is fine, I guess) and the story is bad. Even as it's supposed to be a ""reboot"" or ""prequel"" or whatever you wanna call it, it still doesn't portray the characters as it should. If you haven't seen any of the previous movies, TV shows or cartoons (which are ALL PERFECT by the way), you would have no idea what's going on and why a certain character is as they are. Very poor character portrayal and storyline. The voice acting of the whole cast is probably the best thing about this one. I really hope there won't be any new live-action remake soon, because those first 2 movies are legendary and timeless and shouldn't be touched.",The Addams Family
