0,SnoopyStyle,should be mini-series,7,20 February 2020,"Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) leads a group with monstrous appetite for young children. They eat the shine from the few special children. One of those is Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) who survived the Overlook Hotel with his mother. He grows up hiding his Shining. Rose recruits Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) as the new pusher. Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) is a young girl with the Shining.I watched the director's cut which is three hours long. Even the shorter version is two and a half hours. It's rather long for a modern theatrical movie. This is really a Netflix mini-series. Otherwise, there are generally two major issues. The first is that the start stumbles a little. Wendy should be besides herself. Young Danny supposedly relieved her of her crazy anxiety due to the events and the movie needs to make a big show of it. Also the little girl needs to have the horrifying murder like Jacob Tremblay. A movie needs to jump off with both feet. A good start is Pennywise in the sewer eating a child. This movie's start should punch you in the face. The second is that Abra is too powerful. The only true threat comes from Crow. The Winnebago gang is inferior and it never feels that dangerous. Also why didn't Dan bring guns to the Overlook? They are not immune to bullets. It seems like a more effective weapon than an axe. Sure the axe has meaning but it is still an axe.There are some very compelling aspects in this movie. It's interesting to have this movie's versions of the old movie. McGregor is great and the girl is great. Rebecca Ferguson is very interesting as a villain. Again, the tension would be heightened if she's more powerful than the girl. Overall, it's an intriguing companion piece to the classic.",Doctor Sleep
1,claudio_carvalho,It Is not a Horror Film,7,31 January 2020,"Danny Torrance (from ""The Shining"") is a grownup alcoholic adult (Ewan McGregor) that has fought his demons along his life and used his abilities to lock them up in boxes in his brain. He joins an AA group, moves to another town and befriends Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis). Meanwhile a dangerous group of predator creatures led by Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) hunt down people that ""shine"" like Danny to feed with their steam and remain immortal. When Dan knows the powerful girl Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), he decides to protect her from the predators.""Doctor Sleep"" is a dramatic fantasy film that uses the adult life of Danny Torrance from Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""The Shining"" in a full of action story that slightly recalls ""Near Dark"". Rebecca Ferguson and her costumes with the hat is gorgeous and stylish. If the viewer expects a sequel of ""The Shining"" of even a horror movie, he or she will be disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Doutor Sono"" (""Doctor Sleep"")",Doctor Sleep
2,nogodnomasters,Pain Purifies the Steam,9,16 November 2019,"The film re-introduces Danny (Ewan McGregor) the little boy from ""The Shing."" The setting jumps 2011. We are also introduced to Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) who leads a group of people who consumes those with ""the Shining."" Abra (Kyliegh Curran) a young girl has the gift and is very strong. They could feed off of her for years.The opening of the film was riveting. Rebecca Ferguson was perfect in her role and I wish they had expanded the part of Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind ). Ewan McGregor didn't carry the part as well as I had hoped, but was acceptable.Guide: F-word. Nudity. Implied sex.",Doctor Sleep
3,kosmasp,Shining (a light),8,29 March 2020,"Now if you were not aware of the Original (don't be condescending if possible, not everyone can know all the movies), this is a good reason to (re)visit it - no pun intended! It will stay with you once seen and it will set the field for this sequel, which some might feel comes way too late, but than again, when should it have come out? The timing is quite good I'd say.I'd also say that the movie is quite good. I know some will disagree and will not like this at all for various reasons. Try not to expect a copy of the Shining. This is paying tribute, by also being differently when it comes to certain scares, to the story and more.I have not read the source material this is based on, but it does a good job for those who've seen the Shining and treads the story with enough respect. There are holes in the story and flaws in the telling - but overall this is entertaining and scary enough to be more than just a decent viewing",Doctor Sleep
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A remarkably good film.,9,18 October 2020,"Great job Mike Flanagan.I don't know what's going on with movies lately, I have high expectations and films suck, or in this case, my expectations were fairly low, and I was blown away.What a truly worthy follow up to The Shining this was. Almost forty years on, it captures the tone, spirit and vibe of that great film.You'd think at over two and a half hours it would be overlong, it isn't,that running time allows the complex story to be told, and for the characters to be fully developed.Young Kyleigh Curran is remarkably good, and in great company with Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson, very well acted.A great start, with that amazing music, and those glorious panoramic shots. It takes time before you arrive at that destination, the one we all waited for. The recreation is remarkable.All those involved, take a bow, this was outstanding, 9/10.",Doctor Sleep
5,classicsoncall,"""It seems to me you grew up fine, son, but you still owe a debt. Do it!""",8,5 November 2020,"With frequent flashbacks and timely references, ""Doctor Sleep"" tells the story of the adult Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who survived the horrific events of 1980's ""The Shining"". This film stands alone well enough, but having seen the original movie or read the book would probably add to a richer experience for the viewer. What's a little distracting is the replacement of characters from the older movie, as the stand-ins for Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers for example, don't resonate as well as the more celebrated actors. The new villains from The True Knot are formidable, and characters like Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), Crow Daddy (Zahn McClarnon) and Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) are quite charismatic, although it felt like they fell victim to the young Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) a bit too easily. While Colorado's Overlook Hotel took on the aspect of a character in and of itself in the original picture, here it was more of a place for Danny to return to in order to take care of unfinished business. The return of the denizens of the doomed hotel to defeat Rose was a nice touch, as well as the garden maze setting to set up the denouement. What I'd like to see now, and maybe someone could suggest it to Stephen King, is a full length novel or picture detailing the mysterious powers of Azzie the Cat. You would think the feline who played the part would have deserved a screen credit.",Doctor Sleep
6,lee_eisenberg,we all communicate,7,10 August 2020,"Without a doubt, Stanley Kubrick's adaption of ""The Shining"" was going to be a hard act to follow. It turns out that Mike Flanagan's adaptation of ""Doctor Sleep"" does a fair enough job. I read the book, and obviously the movie had to change some things to function more as a sequel to Kubrick's movie. With Danny an adult and now facing a new set of dangers, the movie has some gruesome scenes. The callbacks to the original movie were a little over-the-top, but they evoke nostalgia nonetheless. Worth seeing.",Doctor Sleep
7,jboothmillard,Doctor Sleep,6,4 November 2019,"The Shining is a masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, and one of the most renowned adaptations of a Stephen King novel (although King himself hates it), now almost forty years comes the sequel, based on the book from King, directed by Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush, Ouija: Origin of Evil). Basically, in 1980, sometime after escaping the Overlook Hotel, Danny Torrance (Roger Dale Floyd) and his mother Wendy (Alex Essoe) live in Florida. Danny is haunted by the ghost of the hideous old woman in the bath from the Overlook. The ghost of Dick Hallorann (Carl Lumbly) appears before him and teaches him to lock such ghosts in imaginary ""boxes"" in his mind. Meanwhile, a cult known as the True Knot, led by Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), feed on the psychic essence of young people with Shining abilities like Danny possesses to maintain their immortality. She recruits a teenage girl called Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) into the cult after observing her ability to telepathically control people. In 2011, grown up Danny, now ""Dan"" (Ewan McGregor) is still traumatized by the events at the Overlook, he has become an alcoholic to suppress his Shining. He moves to a small town and befriends Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis), who gets him a job and becomes his sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous. Dan begins to improve and soon finds a job at a hospice. Three he uses his Shine abilities to comfort dying patients, who give him the nickname ""Doctor Sleep"". He begins communicating telepathically with a young girl named Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), whose Shining abilities are even more powerful than his. In 2018, the True Knot are starving as their supply of essence is running low. They abduct young boy Bradley Trevor (Jacob Tremblay), who has a talent playing baseball, torturing him to death to extract as much of his essence as they can. A teenage Abra senses the event, and her distress alerts both Dan and Rose. Abra is now sought by Rose who wants to extract her essence to sustain the cult. Realising that she is in danger, Abra visits Dan, he insists that she should stay away and avoid drawing attention to herself. That night, Rose projects herself into Abra's mind, but she is stunned as the girl manages to trap her, and she briefly enters Rose's mind. Wounded, Rose returns to her body and sends the True Knot to capture Abra. Dan is surprised when the ghost of Hallorann returns to visit him, he instructs him to protect Abra. Abra tells Dan what happened with Rose and says she can track the cult if she can touch the glove of the ""baseball boy"". Dan tells Billy what is going on, and they travel to the murder scene and unearth the boy's body to retrieve the glove. They go to Abra's house, Abra psychically shows her father Dave (Zackary Momoh) everything, they recruit him and devise a plan. Abra psychically projects herself as bait to lure the cult, then Dan and Billy shoot most of them dead, though Snakebite Andi telepathically manipulates Billy into killing himself before dying. Rose's lover, Crow Daddy (Zahn McClarnon), kills Dave and abducts Abra, drugging her to suppress her abilities. Dan communicates with Abra, who allows him to possess her temporarily; they make Crow Daddy crash his car, killing him and freeing Abra. While Dan and Abra reunite, Rose consumes the cult's stockpile of essence, healing her wounds and vowing revenge for their deaths. Danny decides to return to the Overlook Hotel, which has since been abandoned, he believes it will be as dangerous for Rose as it is for him and Abra. He activates all power in the boiler room, ""awakening"" it in the process. Danny revisits the rooms where his father Jack, influenced by the spirits of the hotel, attempted to murder him and Wendy. At the hotel bar, Dan is offered alcohol by a bartender (Henry Thomas) who strongly resembles Jack. Rose arrives at the hotel. Dan fails as he and Abra his attempt to lock her in a box in Dan's mind. Abra flees as Danny tries to fend off Rose with an axe, but Rose overpowers him. As she drains Dan of his essence, all the boxes in mind are opened, releasing several of the Overlook's ghosts, who quickly surround and kill Rose. Dan is possessed by the ghosts and begins to hunt for Abra. When she manages to free him momentarily, he tells her to flee the hotel. Struggling with possession, Dan returns to the boiler room, which becomes engulfed in flames. In his last moment, Dan is transported back to his childhood to experience Wendy holding him. Abra watches helplessly as the hotel burns down. Later, Abra talks to the ghost of Dan, who comforts her before disappearing. In her bathroom, Abra sees the rotting woman from the Overlook, and goes to confront her. Also starring Bruce Greenwood as Dr. John, Chelsea Talmadge as Deenie, Catherine Parker as Silent Sarey, Jocelin Donahue as Lucy Stone and The Shining's Danny Lloyd as Spectator at Baseball Game. McGregor is terrific as the grown-up Danny using his Shining for good, Ferguson is splendid as the whimsical psycho, and Curran is a wonderful new talent as the young girl with a highly powerful Shining herself. This is a completely different experience to what came before, the supernatural material is as good as before, and the immortal cult plot adds a new dimension, there are the necessary and nostalgic returns to the original movie, it has stylish visual effects and is atmospheric in its own right, and there are tense moments that work well, a worthwhile psychological horror. Good!",Doctor Sleep
8,BA_Harrison,Don't overlook it.,8,19 February 2020,"If you're a fan of Stephen King's style of writing, then there's a good chance you'll really enjoy Doctor Sleep, which is one of the most King-ian (or is that 'King-esque'?) screen adaptations of his work that I have seen in a long time, the film brimming with atmosphere and memorable characters, with all the little idiosyncrasies that make King's books so special. Hell, it's even got a weak finalé (lifted from King's original novel of The Shining, but never featured Kubrick's film).Ewan McGregor (proving to me that he CAN still act after I had almost written him off) plays Dan Torrance, all grown up, womanising, getting wasted and doing his best not to 'shine'. Travelling to a small New Hampshire town, Dan meets Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis), who gives the 'lost soul' a chance to turn his life around, securing him a job at a local hospice. It is there that Dan earns the nickname Doctor Sleep because of his uncanny ability to comfort the patients at their moment of death. He must use the full range of his powers, however, after teenager Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) contacts him telepathically, warning him of a ancient tribe of people called The True Knot, who feed on those who shine, sucking up the 'steam' produced when their victims experience pain and suffering. Combining his abilities with those of Abra, Dan eventually confronts Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), leader of The True Knot, at his old 'haunt', The Overlook Hotel, where he introduces her to some familiar faces.Director Mike Flanagan (Gerald's Game) provides plenty of nods to the original Shining movie plus lots of impressively mounted scenes of his own devising (the murder of a little leaguer is genuinely disturbing and Rose's astral projection scene is stunningly executed), and he manages to hold the viewer's interest throughout despite a whopping three hour run-time and a measured pace. The build-up is so well-crafted that, when the final show-down arrives, it cannot help but feel a little anti-climactic (with the destruction of The Overlook being rather contrived). That said, as a whole this is a very admirable sequel to a much-loved horror classic and well worth checking out.",Doctor Sleep
9,paul_haakonsen,Somewhat disappointing actually...,4,16 December 2019,"Well, I was somewhat thrilled about sitting down to watch the 2019 movie ""Doctor Sleep"" from director Mike Flanagan, especially because this movie had a lot riding on it. How so? Well, I mean ""The Shining"" is such an iconic and mammoth of a horror movie that it left some massive footsteps for ""Doctor Sleep"" to fill out.And now that I've watched ""Doctor Sleep"", I must admit that I am left with an overwhelming sense of 'was that really it?' This movie was just a swing and a miss, especially in comparison to the legacy left by ""The Shining"", and the storyline told in ""Doctor Sleep"" was sort of pointless and essentially just felt like something left over on the cutting room table from the first movie.It should be said that they definitely had a great cast ensemble for the movie, with some interesting choices and good acting performances,
Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson definitely carried the movie quite well. However, it just felt like the characters were sort of bland and rather mundane. Especially Rose the Hat, as this character was never really given the full chance to be all it could, so much wasted potential there.Visually ""Doctor Sleep"" is a good treat, lots of nice effects. I was especially impressed with the make-up and effects on the members of the True Knot group. That was just amazing.However, the movie left way too many doors opened and questions unanswered, and it felt like an incomplete movie and a half-hearted attempt to make a proper sequel to a great predecessor. I have to say that I was disappointed with this outcome of this movie. Sure, it was watchable and entertaining enough if you aren't familiar with ""The Shining"", but if you are, then this was a shallow foray into the characters, events and locations.I will say that the last part of the movie at the Overlook hotel was the best part of the movie, surprise surprise! It was such a glorious visit to that familiar and dreaded place. That was actually the best part of the movie, but it was not enough to make up for an otherwise less than mediocre storyline.My rating of ""Doctor Sleep"" is a four out of ten stars. The movie just failed to deliver where it counted, and it wasn't able to step up to filling out the shoes of ""The Shining"".",Doctor Sleep

He has spent his whole life trying to ignore his powers and forget about those events. He has ended up in a small town in New Hampshire and is a recovering alcoholic turning his life around. Meanwhile a band of shining-endowed people are seeking out children with the gift, in order to feed off their shining. They meet their match in Abra, a teenage girl whose powers far exceed anyone else's. Danny and Abra team up to stop their murderous rampage.Great sequel to The Shining. I had low expectations for the film, figuring The Shining didn't need a sequel and this would not do it any justice. I needn't have worried.Writer-director Mike Flanagan does a good job at adapting Stephen King's novel to the silver screen. Stanley Kubrick he is not but Doctor Sleep does manage to stand on its own. Towards the end the film does rely on many scenes and settings from The Shining but for the most part it is good enough to exist on its own.Flanagan builds the intensity and intrigue well, making for riveting viewing. Despite its 2.5-hour length the film is never dull and the time seems to fly by.On the negative side, there are some aspects of the plot which seem thrown in just for complexity or twist's sake. The final few scenes feel a bit random at times due to the twists thrown in. These twists also make the plot less watertight.Overall, a great film.",Doctor Sleep
15,oscaralbert,It's even WORSE than we think . . .,8,19 November 2019,". . . the always eponymous Warner Bros. warn America with DOCTOR SLEEP. It turns out that one side of our current political divide are outright demons, DOCTOR SLEEP reveals. This film's characters such as ""Rose the Hat,"" ""Crow Daddy,"" ""Grandpa Flick,"" ""Snakebite Andy,"" ""Short Eddie,"" ""Diesel Doug,"" ""Silent Savoy,"" ""Apron Annie,"" and ""Barry the Chunk"" all correspond to their easily identifiable, prominent Real Life Pachyderm Party counterparts, as far as anyone with a passing familiarity for Current Events will attest. Obviously, Warner Bros. doesn't dare to make DOCTOR SLEEP's tots-under-the-scalpel tortures as horrible as the pernicious Pachyderms' ACTUAL atrocities against Immigrant Children of Color, Ukrainian civilians, our Kurdish hero\protectors, and poor working class Americans in general. However, the prophetic prognosticators working for Warner are spot-on with their depiction of baseball player ""Bradley Trevor's"" doom, foretelling the disaster awaiting the 21 Nationals sell-outs (along with their manager and coaches). It's not a pretty sight.. Perhaps the main takeaway of DOCTOR SLEEP is that we must destroy the demons walking among us with Extreme Prejudice.",Doctor Sleep
16,view_and_review,I Don't Listen to Box Office Numbers,8,2 December 2019,"I read that Doctor Sleep was a bomb in the box office. Good thing I don't listen to critics and box office figures. I thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep and I'm not ashamed to admit it.Doctor Sleep is essentially a sequel to The Shining. I haven't looked this up at all but I would venture a guess that after Mary Poppins Returns, Doctor Sleep is the longest gap for a sequel in cinematic history.The main character is Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who was the little boy in The Shining. We're treated to some early footage, some a remake and some original, which establishes just who Danny is. This movie sheds some light on the occurrences in The Shining, and furthermore we learn that this ""shining"" is a gift, almost like a superpower. There are people/creatures that feed on this gift-- that manifests itself in the form of steam-- by inhaling it; so there is a little bit of Sleepwalkers in Doctor Sleep (gotta love how the Steven King stuff ties together).The plot is cohesive and compelling. Plus, I was a fan of the little girl that starred opposite Ewan McGregor. Abra (Kyliegh Curran) was smart, bold, adorable, and powerful. You couldn't ask for better qualities. She was essentially a tiny superhero. The ""Overlookers"" or whatever they were called, desperately wanted Abra for her steam. They were led by a powerful woman named Rose (Rebecca Ferguson) and it was going to take a lot to fight her off.The movie was intense with some good imagery and graphic effects. And, for us older folks, a few nostalgic throwbacks in there for old time's sake.",Doctor Sleep
17,neil-476,The sequel which Kubrick's The Shining needed,9,7 November 2019,"When Dan Torrance was a boy, his psychic gift - his Shining - was so powerful that he became the target for evil forces which wished to consume it. Even after the family tragedy which should have ended things he had to develop defences to protect himself. As an adult he took refuge in alcohol, but something draws him to a small town in Maine where he joins Alcoholics Anonymous and gets a job in a hospice where he is able to use his gift to ease the suffering and fears of those on the point of death.Meanwhile a group of what one might call psychic vampires, headed by Rose the Hat, extend their lifespans by consuming the psychic lifeforces - which they call ""steam"" of psychically gifted individuals, particularly children. They encounter the prodigiously gifted 12-year old Abra who has already met Dan (albeit without them actually meeting each other). Can Dan protect Abra against a group of predators who have been successful for hundreds of years?Stephen King's book continues Danny Torrance's story, but is a sequel to The Shining only in the loosest sense. This film, however, is a direct sequel: the final third abandons the events of the book and takes up from the ending of Kubrick's film. I am one of those who loved King's book and therefore liked and loathed, in equal measure, Kubrick's film as it casually discarded the loving heart of the book and marched uncaringly into overstatement and overacting.This adaptation does a fine job of picking up Kubrick's hatchet job and restoring the heart which was missing from his film. I left the cinema very happy indeed.Ewan McGregor is a good Dan, Rebecca Ferguson is a better Rose the Hat, and Kyliegh Curran is stunningly good as Abra Stone.I loved this.",Doctor Sleep
18,morrison-dylan-fan,The Big Sleep.,10,21 November 2019,"One of my most memorable film viewings of the 2010's was when I decided to try a Horror at the cinema which I had heard nothing about it. From the opening moments of Oculus (2013-also reviewed), the stylisation by writer/editor/directing auteur Mike Flanagan instantly stood out from other Horror flicks I'd seen at that time, with the ""apple"" scene making me eager to see what Flanagan did next.Along with discovering fellow auteur Dario Argento at around the same time with The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970-also reviewed), I felt that like Dario, each new creation by Flanagan was building on the themes/ motifs of Oculus-leading to Flanagan becoming my top film maker of the 2010's.Having seen everything he has done this decade,I started to hope that like Dario's Opera (1987-also reviewed), that this would be a grand summery of all Flanagan has been building towards.
View on the film:Greeting an impending victim and the audience with ""Hi there!"" Rebecca Ferguson gives a chillingly mesmerising, layered performance as Rose, who when hanging out with her ""family"" has Ferguson bring out a acid hippy sting, where Rose's murderous streak is just under the skin of her free spirit appearance.In only her second credit, Kyliegh Curran's turn as Stone stands equal to those of the cast with far more credits, due to Curran capturing Stone's shock at becoming fully aware of her ""Shining"" skills,which she mixes with a seeping terror of Rose sniffing her out.Spending most of his adult life using any vice at hand to keep his childhood nightmares locked away, Ewan McGregor gives a terrific turn as Torrance,with McGregor bringing out the crustiness that has held him for years, which is shaved off by McGregor with a rush of blood to the head to keep Stone alive,along with a dread of confronting his past.Opening the shine following a child to her death at the hands of Rose and her family in a isolated countryside held with the same eerie silence as the remote locations of Hush and Gerald's Game (both also reviewed) editor/writer/directing auteur Mike Flanagan reunites with his regular cinematographer Michael Fimognari and shines a light on the motifs they have built across the decade.Reuniting with composers The Newton Brothers, Flanagan continues to masterfully use sparse sounds to twist the screws of the psychological chills, via the lone drumming sound of heartbeats pounding to the primal viciousness of Rose. Reflecting all Torrance has turned his back from, Flanagan superbly builds on his recurring mirrors motif with ultra-stylised whip-pans reaching out Rose's hands to Stone.Going back to where Torrance's childhood ended, Flanagan continues to build on his major theme of people facing the ghosts of their past, with a superb visualization of Torrance suppressing/ locking his traumas deep in the abyss. His second take on a Stephen King adaptation, Flanagan finely balances the fantastical of the ""family"" eating the ""Shine"" of kids, with the incredible brutality of child killers Rose and her gang.Bringing a fuller, psychologically unsettling side to Rose in her being a monster who actually makes mistakes,Flanagan brings everyone together for a excellent encounter in The Overlook Hotel, a location where Flanagan lights the major theme across his work, via Torrance becoming a whole person by opening the boxes to the suppressed ghostly nightmares from childhood horrors,which wake up Dr. Sleep.",Doctor Sleep

So I didn't know what this one could do to this flick. This is more fantasy then horror but still, on his own it was a rather good flick. Towards the end you will get the connections to The Shining.

20,mm-39,Strong film!,9,15 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is in the true spirit of Steve King stories. P C culture kills King movies with over baring social messages. Characters of certain backgrounds are bound by thin character development. Cut out characters where this character has to be weak and stupid, a women has to be this way, the guy has to be this way etc. P C story has everyone coming together (B B F) the audience gets a new hash tag s moment ending which destroys a good King film. When all the Hollywood social posturing is removed from a King story we get a great bare boned flawed character development story with character development that has continuity with older stories. What works for the horror is the reality and complications of character which reflects real life people. The character's mistakes flaws etc make the character believable. The audience relates better to a real life character. Well the Danny character has P T S D from the incidents with his father in the previous Shinning movie which leads the viewer into the previous movie. Doctor Sleep follow's Father Jack's fault of alcoholism are passed onto his son Dan, and the viewer is given a hint that Danny drinks to shut out this Shinning ability. We see faults, but a good side where the flawed character can redeem himself. There is the old cook (Hallorann) from the last film which needs a favor (who only Danny's see.) pushes the story along. Cut to a different town and their is this little black girl with the this huge Shinning ability. There is no empowerment, or any other hash tag moment with the little girl character, but good character continuity story development of her character. As director/actor Eastwood once says never insult the audience intelligence but hint the sub stories and let the audience decide. I was wondering, while watching, why does this teenage girl have so much power? Then I see Abra is black and the dead cook (Hallorann) is black and asked Danny for this favor and then oooo the girl is a family member of the dead cook, because the cook said the Shinning is passed onto family members in the last movie. Just brilliant! Cut to another area of the U S A, their is a evil tribe which feeds on the Shinning good Spirits and Danny and Abra Stone now teenager must face off against this evil. Woven into DR Sleeps' main story is a P T S D sub story about facing one past, and a visit to the infamous hotel. A re-creation of a meeting with the famous Bartender scene as the story repletes itself is movie genius. A classic scene. Many parts of Doctor Sleep has historical repetition in the true spirit of The Shinning theme recurrence. Dr Sleep brilliantly creates the recurrence theme melding Shinning and Doctor Sleep into a great film with flaws, twists and sub stories. I will not give away anymore of a great film 9 stars.",Doctor Sleep
21,deloudelouvain,Forty years to wait is a long time but totally worth it.,9,29 January 2020,"I'm always amazed by the weak arguments of some negative reviewers. How you can rate this movie with a low score is just a thing I can't understand. The Shining (1980) from Stanley Kubrick was/is a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that, so I get it that it is very difficult to have a sequel of the same quality but I think Mike Flanagan did a pretty good job with Doctor Sleep. We had to wait almost forty years to get this movie (I feel suddenly so old) but it was worth the wait. Doctor Sleep is a long movie but not once did I get bored as the story is just captivating from start till end. The cast was very good if not excellent. Ewan McGregor did a great job playing the now adult Danny Torrance. Rebecca Ferguson couldn't do a better job with her character. In fact nobody from the whole cast failed to deliver. I thought it was a great adaptation of Stephen Kings' novel, a worthy follow-up of The Shining, I will certainly watch this movie again. Like I watched The Shining at least five times I will now have the occasion to watch those two movies in a row in the future, that will be a great movie day.",Doctor Sleep
22,siderite,"It feels King and, even if it has little connection to The Shining, it's pretty good",8,17 June 2021,"The little boy in The Shining has grown and is trying to go on with his life while hungry ghosts are hunting him. Just as he was getting his life together he comes into contact with another ""shiner"", a little girl that is also hunted by hungry creatures, this time some sort of energetic vampires. As with many Stephen King adaptations, things are cruel and weird and a bit too long, but in the end there is a reckoning.I thought Ewan McGregor played his role well. He practically carrier the film on his shoulders because the little girl was annoying both as a character and as an actress. At least she has the excuse that she's young and has no agency of experience. However, who really got to shine (pardon the pun) was the leader of the vampires, played by Rebecca Ferguson. Beautiful and intense, you almost want her to survive at the end.I would say that the first part of the film was the most intriguing, followed by a way too long a stretch that could have been edited away and an ending that felt too short and lacking meaning. I liked the feel of the film, though. It felt like a Stephen King story and I didn't mind that the connection between The Shining and this film was strenuous. I guess I have to recommend it.",Doctor Sleep
23,thesar-2,Shining On...(Director's Cut),9,28 February 2021,"I am uncertain why I don't pull the trigger and grant this 5/5 stars. It's really that good. Well, the Director's Cut, anyways.Previously, I watched the theatrical cut from my one and only Redbox rental. I liked it, found the third act predictable and probably rated it 4/5 stars with no intention of seeing it again. But, thanks to my favorite YouTube channel: Dead Meat, who did a cut comparison between the theatrical and Director's cuts, I decided to revisit the Overlook Curse once more.Glad I did. This time, the movie was fantastic. Even at just under three hours minus credits, I couldn't take my eyes away. It's like it was a brand-new movie taking all the positives and multiplying them and making a more coherent story.This is one of those rare sequels that's worthy of being one, but at the same time almost completely different. Sure, it's a shadow of the original Shining, including the same locales, characters and while expanding, using the same mythos. But this one takes the original in so many different directions, I could see a series of these movies, but with each in yet another path.Danny & Mom, the original survivors of the Overlook mayhem in 1980, live on, but the baggage is always with them. Meanwhile, there are more Shiners out there than just special Danny. In fact, there's more kinds of special humans. Some dark and those who feed off of the lighter ones.Really, you need to see and absorb this great script and forget the theatrical cut all-together. No need. This is the definite vision and a fine companion to the masterpiece, The Shining.Before I forget...I don't know if I could be more in love with Rebecca Ferguson. To date, I haven't seen a performance from her I didn't like. And I especially like her Rose the Hat here. She was so delicious in the role, she should've been nominated for an Oscar and more people should be talking about her as one of the best villains in cinema.***Final thoughts: I know this might make me lose some steam from a group of people, but tonight's experience with this reminded me of the first time I saw Batman v Superman: The Ultimate Edition. While I really liked the BvS theatrical cut, the Ultimate Edition shot the movie up in my eyes tenfold. Like it was a brand-new experience and a much better one. Same here. To me, there's absolutely no reason to check out the theatrical cuts of either Doctor Sleep or Batman v Superman. Just set aside 3 hours for each and enjoy these fantastic movies.",Doctor Sleep

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Very impressive adaptation of King's sequel to The Shining,9,3 November 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOver thirty years after the events at The Overlook Hotel, Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is now a grown man, with various issues in his life as a result of the trauma he experienced as a child. However, he still possesses his 'shining' ability, and that may come in handy, when he connects with Abra Stone (Kyleigh Curran), a young girl who has become chillingly aware of the existence of a group called The True Knot, lead by the evil Rose the Hat (Rebecca Furguson), who prey on the steam of children who shine. Together, she and Danny must stop their evil once and for all.Thirty five years after the release of his novel The Shining, the pressure must have finally got to Stephen King, and after enormous pressure from his fans, in 2013 he released the novella Doctor Sleep, which I finally got round to reading earlier this year. After being impressed, it was all the better that this new filmic adaptation would arrive so soon afterwards, and that the hype would be so rewarding after a slew of modern King works that didn't fit the grade. Indeed, I can safely say Doctor Sleep is the most satisfying adaptation I have experienced in a very long time.It's a pleasant, and not so surprising surprise, that this arrives under the direction of Mike Flanagan, who was behind Netflix's equally impressive adaptation of King's other novel Gerald's Game. His most pleasing achievement is to deliver a strikingly faithful adaptation of the novel, staying true to the events in there and not leaving anything out. He allows the beauty of King's storytelling to naturally get under your skin, using a 'heartbeat' sound to signpost the scary, ominous moments, such as 'The Baseball Boy' scene (a scene as distressing and unpleasant onscreen as in the novel), much more effective than the overwhelming jump scares and constant loud thrashing about that marred It Chapter Two. He also has an eye for casting, and McGregor fits perfectly into the lead role, delivering an effective performance, along with the young Curran as Abra, and Ferguson, whose Rose the Hat will now make a perfect new costume at next years Halloween parties.Just as the fans of the novel demanded a follow up, so did the fans of the original film version, and in the finale in The Overlook Hotel, Flanagan seems to cater for them, abandoning the original story arc to allow for some subtle references to the 1980 Stanley Kubrick classic. This creates a kind of cut and shut feel to it, but doesn't spoil the experience overall.It's rare to get a King transition to screen that is this successful, and that should be pleasing in itself, an original and classy sequel, focusing on themes of being a persecuted minority and, a familiar trope King explored with It, how the seemingly innocent and friendly can be so callous and deceitful. ****",Doctor Sleep
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mister Sandman, show me your shine.",7,4 November 2019,"As a fan of 'The Shining (1980)', the very existence of 'Doctor Sleep (2019)' is annoying. However, as a fan of film, I can't deny that this is a pretty good effort. It's at its best whenever it isn't trying to tie into its predecessor. During these moments, it feels distinct. Its aesthetic, tone and narrative are a world away from their counterparts in Kubrick's masterpiece. The experience is definitely much less derivative than it could have been. It feels less a horror and more a dark fantasy - though, admittedly, these labels mean relatively little. It's, essentially, an exercise in adventure as opposed to terror. Of course, it does have its share of horrific moments. The stand-out of these is a brutal extended torture sequence involving a child, which is certainly disturbing. It has a generally downbeat tone and bursts of creepy imagery, but it isn't exactly scary - at least, not like its big brother. A fair amount of screen-time is dedicated to Danny's time at the Overlook, though. A few scenes from its first appearance are even recreated. These segments sometimes feel like 'fan-service', even if the decision to recast separates them somewhat. The finale makes a point of finishing the major conflict early so that the hotel can become the 'bad guy' again, which feels clunky and, even, entirely unnecessary. The tie-in stuff just tends to remind you of how good 'The Shining (1980)' is. This is particularly frustrating because, for the most part, Flanagan's film is its own thing. Sure, it's certainly a sequel, but it isn't just a narrative rehash. Instead, it's an exploration of modern-day Danny and the hidden world surrounding the 'shine'. It does expand on several purposefully ambiguous aspects of Kubrick's piece, widening its world and re-contextualising its events in an incredibly overt way but, if you take it for what it is, it works. The affair is far more overt than the first, anyway. This isn't necessarily bad, but the thing falls into a trap that 'Blade Runner 2049 (2017)' - a similar endeavour - managed to so deftly avoid. Even though it doesn't exactly tarnish the legacy of one of cinema's most enduring experiences, it does change the way it can be viewed and, in way, provides definitive answers for it. As I said up top, though, it's an entertaining affair in its own right. It's long, baggy and inconsistent but, when it's working, it's enjoyable and somewhat suspenseful. It's well-directed and well-acted (even if Ferguson really can't hold an Irish lilt), typically balancing its slightly silly elements with its deadly serious ones. Though the characters are all quite basic and, dare I say, dull, they're developed a decent amount and are compelling enough to keep you invested in their journey. It's always engaging and, sometimes, even surprisingly poignant. When the movie is being its own thing, it's entertaining and unique, the kind of horror that's not really made anymore. When it isn't, it just reminds you that it isn't a match for 'The Shining (1980)'. If I return to the Overlook hotel, I'll be arriving in 1980. 7/10",Doctor Sleep
27,dromasca,closer to King than to Kubrick,6,27 August 2020,"'Doctor Sleep', written and directed by Mike Flanagan in 2019 is a 'sequel'. It takes, I think, a significant dose of audacity (not to say chutzpah) to make a sequel to one of the most famous and best-made horror thrillers in the history of cinema - 'The Shining' created by Stanley Kubrick in 1980. The risk of comparisons with a high level standard is obvious. At the same time the film is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel, which is in turn a sequel to the book on which Kubrick's film was based. 'The Shining' was a summit meeting between Kubrick's creativity and Jack Nicholson's madness. Mike Flanagan did not have the courage to stray far enough from King's novel (who disliked the first movie) as Kubrick had done and to replace elements of popular culture with ambiguity and pure horror. Trying to combine too many genres, borrowing characters and sets from Kubrick's film, but remaining too faithful to the story in King's novel, Flanagan made a reasonable movie but one which is far from the depth and thrill of the original.Dan Torrance, the kid from 'The Shining', survived a childhood haunted by ghosts, but he seems to miss his life until he meets good people to lead him on the right path of a (too) normative existence. As a job, he uses his powers to soothe the last moments of the terminaly sick elders in a hospital. In his free time, he enters into telepathic communication with a teenager girl with similar powers and visions. When she notices the serial murders of a gang of - let us call them - vampires who prolong their lives by ritually and sadistically killing children with similar powers and absorbing their 'shining', the two have no choice but to meet and to act together to destroy the forces of darkness. The problem is that everything that was metaphoric at Kubrick (starting with 'the shining') becomes explicit graphics in Flanagan's film. From a well-constructed, deep but subtle horror world we are thrown into a film that would belong to the genre 'teenagers vs. vampires' if it was not populated with violent graphic scenes that restrict the audiences to whom I would recommend this film.Ewan McGregor is the right choice for the role of Dan Torrence 39 years after 'The Shining' and the too idealized elements of his character cannot be attributed to him but to the script. The two female characters are real revelations. Rebecca Ferguson is Rose the Hat, a character who at first seems out of Lewis Caroll's writings but who turns out to be one of the most successful incarnations of sexy and evil witches I've seen on screen lately. I don't like the roles of children or teenagers in movies that I wouldn't recommend to children and teenagers, but I can't help but notice the extraordinary role of Kyliegh Curran, a teenage actress with a remarkable personality and expressiveness, who I hope will grow into an outstanding mature actress. The last part of 'Doctor Sleep' recreates the sets and characters from 'The Shining' and from a visual point of view it looks very good. In general, the story has rhythm and fluency. I believe that the film will please many fans of the genres that Mike Flanagan mixed in the production pot, but Kubrick's admirers can't help but notice that it's closer to the popular culture of Stephen King's novels and to the scripts of most of the movies which they inspired rather than the subtlety and depth of Stanley Kubrick's films. Flanagan is not Kubrick, nor is the film industry of 2019 the same as in 1980.",Doctor Sleep
28,ThomasDrufke,"""Well, hi there""",6,8 November 2019,"It's hard to review a film that I'm not sure even the studio fully knows how they want the film to be perceived. For a long time, they were not calling this film a sequel to The Shining movie, but rather, the adaptation of the Doctor Sleep book (which is the sequel to the original Stephen King novel). But if I'm reviewing the film as is, it's both a sluggishly long horror film without a single scare and also a decently cool atmospheric thriller with very good lead performances. One of those performances comes from the always terrific Rebecca Ferguson playing Rose The Hat. If this were real life, I would find it very difficult to not succumb to Rose's powers, as brutal as they may be. She's like if Pennywise met Scarlett Johansson's voiceover AI character from Her, if that makes any sense. The first half of the film is difficult to get through as we're constantly jumping from city to city, and expected to care about people we barely know while also being hit over the head with references to The Shining (including some blatantly awkward ones). But I also really liked almost every performance, including some that were more or less extended cameos, but the film ultimately falls way short of my expectations.6.8/10",Doctor Sleep

That was trying too much to bring together 2 separate stories. And really, there's an ax right there waiting for Danny? Why didn't Danny just try to surprise Rose and shoot her like the others. Just attempt another setup. I liked how they showed Abra's powers. Having her ""talk"" to Danny , then meeting him, and them helping each other to beat the ""shining"" eaters. I also liked the introduction of the ""shining"" eaters in the woods creeping out the little girl.FINAL VERDICT: Ok, but 30 minutes too long. Did have several good creep out scenes.",Doctor Sleep
31,Cineanalyst,The Steaming,4,16 February 2021,"There are three or four kinds of movies. Most of them either don't shine--they merely exist and are nothing special at all--or shine so little that they don't know it and so only leverage it haphazardly. The rarest, most special kind shine so brightly that they illuminate the world far and wide, leaving an afterlife of residual effects upon generations: they exhale steam. Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980) was such a film. The last kind is a cannibalistic byproduct of that shining, a residual effect; they run on, feed off of the steam. It's the most insidious, threatening to supersede the magic of the original and redefine it as something lesser: the steam instead of the shine. ""Doctor Sleep"" is this kind of movie.I don't read Stephen King's novels, from which these pictures are based, but I've seen some of the adaptations, and I'm not very interested in starting on the reading. This is an author, after all, who is most notoriously dissatisfied with the most intelligent reworking of one of his books, ""The Shining."" Others have already suggested that ""Doctor Sleep"" and its inevitable adaptation as a reconciliation on King's part with Kubrick's classic. That's another bad indication, as ""Doctor Sleep"" takes a film that brilliantly imbued architecture with such character that it wrote its own story through the surrogate author, going mad behind his typewriter and caught up between a maze of the past, present, living and dead--the real shining of the film--and turns that into comic-book, superhero franchise installment (although the poor box office might put a hold on other adaptations) about competing magical powers. Banal detritus.It's bad enough that so many King adaptations feature the ""magical (African-American)"" (as IMDb censors insist on me calling it) trope (""The Shining"" included), this is a movie that obliviously recycles offensive stereotypes of nomadic gypsy kidnappers for their ""True Knot"" villains, cannibalistically feeding on children's souls and wearing funny hats.Otherwise, ""Doctor Sleep"" only gets around to reliving the architecture of the Overlook Hotel for part of the picture, and the typewriter becomes a mere prop. Apparently, the father of Abra (as in abracadabra, which if that's not enough on the nose, it's pointed out how obvious it is during a magic act for the birthday sequence) is an author (uninterestingly, of a book about dance, I gather), but his character is a throwaway compared to the reflexive authorial construction in ""The Shining"" or another King adaptation such as ""Misery"" (1990).It's the same thing with the many stylistic imitations of Kubrick's film in what is otherwise an unappealing photographed piece of digital cinema. The music, helicopter shots, the wide-angle hallway views, and dissolves are all ripped off at some point, but the sequel doesn't commit to imitating its predecessor's style fully or effectively. Ditto the look-alike impersonators of the actors of the prior film, which are mismatched further by glimpses of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall from the 1980 film. So much of this windbag could've been cut out, too. I can't believe there's a director's cut that pushes the runtime to three hours but adds nothing of value. Who wants to see Abra play the piano downstairs from her upstairs bedroom when there's already the spoons at the birthday party to establish that her shining freaks her parents out? And, I suppose all the alcoholism stuff adds character depth and may've been therapeutic for King, but what about all the afterlife gibberish? I had enough of King's cafeteria Christianity in ""The Stand"" (1994), ""The Green Mile"" (1999) and elsewhere already. Is the doctor from AA really only there to get him a job that advances the plot zilch? That they use these scenes for a cat to know when people are about to die should've been reason enough to excise the subplot. It's enough to put one to sleep. And why is ""Casablanca"" (1942) the film-within-the-film? It's all such a pointless waste of time.To be fair, it's not the most pathetic attempt to put on Kubrick airs. I've seen ""Room 237"" (2012), after all. Still, I'd rather rewatch Steven Spielberg Spielberg-ing of the Overlook Hotel in ""Ready Player One"" (2018). Speaking of more badly-remembered 80s nostalgia, it's like one of the gypsy stereotypes said, ""There used to be more shine in the world.... There's less shine out there, and it's weaker, too. I don't know if it's their cell phones, or diets, or Netflix, or what."" Tell me about it.",Doctor Sleep

He doesn't do that every day. Takes hubris. And cohones of steel. Then Hollywood stepped in, grabbed Ewen MacGregor and Rebecca Ferguson, and did a followup to The SHINING (1980), one of the most iconic hits of all time. And the critics just moaned and groaned and navel-gazed, as per usual. It might be too long. It might have flat spots and missed beats. And it might not pass Ebert's infamous ""watch test.""

34,851222,Amazing,10,13 November 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.I went to see ""Doctor Sleep"" (2019) without any expectations. I haven't seen any trailers, but new about this movie. After coming back from the screening i can only say one thing - this is one of the very best movies i have seen this year so far. ""Doctor Sleep"" is a monumental movie.I always liked ""The Shinning"", but never was a fan of it. Saw it few times, loved directors job and Jack's performance, settings and mood. But i never really understood the main plot of it, hey, but that is just me. Now here comes ""Doctor Sleep"" after seeing which i kinda understood why S.King was never a big fan of Kubric's masterpiece - because it was never about shinning itself - it was about place, Jack, mood and directors vision. Yet in this movie ""shinning"" comes front and center - and i loved the concept of it. And then there is a story in ""Doctor Sleep"" which is nothing short of amazing. I was so involved into this story, not knowing anything about it before seeing it, that even when Ewan's character in one scene recalls his father and talked about him, only after a minute of so i realized, hey that is Jack he was talking about! I mean literally even forgot the first film and was so captivated by this story.And then there is amazing storytelling, which at running time 2 h 22 min. was very fleshed out. You do get to know the characters, their motivation and etc. Directing by a very talented Mike Flanagan whose movies i enjoyed before was terrific - this without a doubt i think is his best work to date. Movie does not relay on jump scare moments and has only very few of them which i really liked. And even most of this movie isn't really a horror movie, but a very captivating story. But if you afraid that isn't not a horror film, at the last act you will get you money back.Overall, ""Doctor Sleep"" (2019) blew me away by its amazing story superbly told. This movie takes its time to tell it, and does this in a good old fashioned movie making way. It all serves to a plot. Great acting, amazing directing makes this an amazing sequel which i will be honest, liked even more then a first film. Great movie, one of the very best in 2019.",Doctor Sleep

36,tabuno,A Pale Imitation That Diverges Tremendously From The Original,5,8 June 2020,"Nothing much original. Alien (1979) mood music is actually copied into the movie. The blatant and supposedly super-creepy early scenes are so obvious and don't really smoothly connect. The audience is given this spoon-fed, stereotypical drunk, washed up man that is confusingly a huge departure from a few earlier scenes when he was a boy. There's the sudden, impulsive revelation of a soap dispenser that comes out of nowhere that's too much of a plot ploy. The origin of the movie's title - Doctor Sleep - in the movie while somewhat powerful, also seems to be introduced as a script-required element that ties one of the earlier beginning scenes together.
The inconsistent use editing of the movie is part of the problem. The early portions of the movie would have been better used as flashbacks so as to allow the more potent details of the here and now pacing of the movie enhanced by flashes from the past. But then later flashbacks are introduced that are excluded from the beginning of the movie that would have offered a better comprehensive backstory and flow to the plot and character development.
The character and tone of Doctor Sleep departs so drastically from its classic predecessor The Shining (1980) that this movie appears to have only erratically captured Stanley Kubrick's masterful original unable to follow in the same artful craftmanship Even the lengthy time duration over which this movie runs, eight years in addition to the beginning scenes of years earlier severely departs from the smooth, immediate continuity of The Shining itself. It would have been fascinating to see an early juxtaposition of this movie with more scenes from The Shining as a way of fusing the two movies together allowing them to build onto each other, making both stronger and connected.
Just as The Shining was indirect in a delicious way, Doctor Sleep seems to be directed and story boarded in a blunt and overly transparent approach, leaving little to the imagination or the mystery and magic of the unknown occult. Additionally, the Sleep Doctor incorporates the profusion of so many different characters unlike The Shining that it diffuses the intensity and focus of each character. With this many characters they become almost two-dimensional, flat stick figures without any depth of personality as with the young seemingly sweet, innocent woman in the first half of the movie, In many ways this movie would have been better suited to have been produced and written as a standalone movie based on its own stories and plot elements such as Clint Eastwood's Hereafter (2010) with Matt Damon.
Attempts to dazzle with special effects instead of story. It attempts to entice its audience with the ""lazy"" vehicle of heightened physical and malevolent violence that only serves to provide a typical horror movie motif instead of something more refined and sophisticated. Instead of black and white depiction of good and evil, the movie could have offered up the evil more in a tortured sympathetic way with the cult-like groupies offering up prays and sacrifice in return for power and strength.
The movie is also filled with inexplicable editing jumps, such as a scene suddenly reveals Dan getting up from the floor without any prefacing introducing to the scene after a series of other supposedly creepy events. There is evil woman, Rosie, saying ""We've got a problem..."" and then says counterintuitively, ""We have to have her."" In most other situations, the normal response would have been 'we need to get as far away as possible for the little girl.' The problem with this movie is imbalance in plot and storyline and a decision to not spend more time on creating a story that had some nuanced sensibility. There is an understandable and plausible depiction of reluctance on Dan's part to get involved and to just avoid and protect the little girl and yet the storyline unnaturally just won't allow for it to happen that way and thus a box is opened in an attempt to smooth over this odd conundrum that scriptwriter ended up with. And really why does the little girl even need Dan in this movie? There is the cliché of ""do you want to do this?"" ""I have to response"" even after discussing the need to try to locate the whereabouts of the groupie cult. In many ways, the movie could have used a much stronger central figure, someone who grew and matured as a result The Shining, coming from a position of power and confidence instead of some sort of hurt, redemptive reconciliation that took up more than a fourth of the movie that didn't do its character's elongated struggle justice.
Problems abound in this movie. There is even a shooting which really wasn't laid out well for cross fire again revealing a rather lazy, sloppy approach to script writing as well as aptly described as ""parlor tricks"" which seem to be beneath the dignity of the user demonstrated earlier and of all the characters to become ""sleepy"" is really an inconsistent choice. Then later the mother seems to go missing in the movie. There is observation that ""listening"" doesn't involve concentration and tightening of one's body and face, but relaxing and opening up. And there is a little girl that's directed by director who isn't able to bring out her masculine nature.
This is a rather gory, parody of vampiric movies that barely resembles the original Shining that results in an only dull imitation with flashes of potential.",Doctor Sleep
37,The-Sarkologist,What It Means to Shine,6,19 November 2019,"Well, there is one thing that I can say about this film - it made me go and watch The Shining. However, there is another thing that I can also say about this film - it isn't the Shining. Yeah, that may be stating the obvious (something that I am prone to do), but the thing is that even though it casts itself as the sequel (namely because the book upon which it is based is the sequel), it sort of pulls away from what Kubrick was trying to do in the original film.Mind you, the creators probably did have their hands tied somewhat, namely because of the contents of the book upon which it was based, and that is probably one of the reasons why it took so long for it to finally come out. However, the film certainly does seem to hark back to Kubrick's masterpiece in a number of instances, recalling some rather vivid scenes from the film (though of course they didn't actually show that scene - I'm sure you know the one that I am referring to), but in a way it just felt forced somewhat.Mind you, the film focuses much more upon Danny's abilities with the Shining - something that the original film really only treated as a side note. In this instance the film takes place a long time after the original, namely at a time when Danny has become an adult. It turns out that people with abilities like Danny's are in hot demand, by a group of people with similar abilities that have discovered a way of living for as long as possible.As such, it comes down to one of those cat and mouse games, particularly when Danny, despite having gone through the ringer and back, finds himself being approached by a young girl who also happens to shine. Basically, she wants his help, as an adult, to track these people down.Well, that is the crux of the film and I must admit that it was nowhere near as exhilarating, or as thrilling, as the original, but a part of me feels that it was never meant to actually be like that. Well, it might have been, but in my mind it was more of a modern fantasy flick as opposed to a horror film, but also it seemed to be intentional that the shining was supposed to be a much greater focus that it was in the original.Still, I did enjoy the film, but honestly, if you are expecting anything along the lines of the original film, well, I'm afraid that you are going to be a little disappointed.",Doctor Sleep

40,Thanos_Alfie,"Different than ""The Shining"" but still very good...",7,19 February 2020,"""Doctor Sleep"" is a Drama - Horror movie in which we are some years after ""The Shining"" and the young Danny is now an adult (Dan Torrance). We also watch a cult trying to capture a young girl who has powers in order to remain immortal and Dan Torrance who can communicate with her try to protect her from them.I liked this movie because of the great connection that makes between ""The Shining"" and ""Doctor Sleep"" and has many great scenes which reminds you not only what happened in the past but also makes you anxious of not knowing what to expect. The direction which was made by Mike Flanagan is very good and it's obvious the hard work he has done. Regarding the interpretations, Ewan McGregor who plays as Dan Torrance is simply amazing, Kyliegh Curran who played as Abra Stone is equally good, Rebecca Ferguson who played as Rose The Hat is simply outstanding and Cliff Curtis who played as Billy Freeman is very good and gives a different touch in the movie.Finally, I have to say that ""Doctor Sleep"" is a great movie to watch with many good scenes, a lot of suspense and many good interpretations made by its cast. I highly recommend this movie to everyone and especially to those who are fans of ""The Shining"" and Stanley Kubrick. Before you watch this movie I suggest you not to be ready to compare the two movies (""The Shining"" and ""Doctor Sleep""), they are two different movies.",Doctor Sleep
41,cruise01,"Thrilling, engaging, and a great follow up to the Shining.",9,5 February 2020,"Doctor Sleep (4.5 out of 5 stars).Doctor Sleep is just about what you can expect for a horror film that is a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining film. It is a very entertaining and really good that lives up to the original film. The Shining is a great classic horror film that had a wonderful and eerie direction. Doctor Sleep does just that with its direction. It is eerie. Creepy. And I love all the nostalgic visits that pays homage to the original. From its music score to the haunting ghosts that follows Danny to the climax that takes place at the Overlook Hotel.I never read the book. The plot is a successful follow up to The Shining. It follows Danny (Ewan McGregor) who tried to overcome his tragic past. Especially, after coming across the ghosts from Overlook. He is an alcoholic and worn down. Until, he senses someone else that has the shining ability Abra (Kyliegh Curran). While, it also raises the attention to a cult like group that feeds on people with psychic abilities that is lead by Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). Danny tries to aid Abra in facing this cult and believes that the only way to stop them. Would be going back to where his demons started at Overlook Hotel.The plot is good. I liked the beginning of the film that follows the aftermath as Danny and his mother are trying to live a normal life. Years go by, the film follows an adult Danny who is suffering from alcohol addiction. And is trying to overcome it from a guy that is trying to help him Billy (Cliff Curtis). The threat in the film played by Rose the Hat is creepy. They are a cult group that are feeding on people with psychic abilities. It gets a little intense with them hunting children. The cult has a group with everyone having their own specialty in abilities. Like one being able to control people. Rose senses someone that may be more powerful than her such as Abra.The film is creepy and does visit some haunting scenes. The direction by Mike Flanagan who wrote the script and edited the film did a great job in bringing this adaptation to life. There are some mind bending scenes with Abra trying to go into Rose's mind. Or going into Danny's was well done. Especially, the cinematography work that twists the set and camera around. The music score by the Newton Brothers is good. Some intense scenes had this heart thudding sound. Or revisiting the original music score is beautifully done.Ewan McGregor did a great job in delivering the role as Danny. Rebecca Ferguson is great as the villain Rose. She is menacing and creepy. Kyleigh Curran who is a stardom stealing the spotlight with her performance as Abra. Which she did a great job in delivering. Cliff Curtis is also good as Danny's mentor.Overall, Doctor Sleep is a really good horror film. The opening scene to the end really captured my attention and was hard to take eyes away from the screen. From its follow up plot that is opening up more about people with the shining ability. The hard themes about addiction and loss. The performances are great with the cast. The direction was good that built a story and creepy and thrilling scenes. I did find the film to be a little slow in parts but it was worth sitting through.",Doctor Sleep
42,zkonedog,A Masterclass In Adapting Tough Material,10,17 December 2019,"Adapting anything in relation to ""The Shining"" was always going to be an arduous task. You have the original novel by Stephen King, the landmark (if confusing) film from Stanley Kubrick--which King utterly hates--, and then King's 2011 novel ""Doctor Sleep"", which is a sequel to the book but NOT the movie. Phew. Remarkably, writer/Director Mike Flanagan creates an expertly-crafted sequel here that somehow manages to satisfy both sides of the coin.For a very basic overview, ""Doctor Sleep"" focuses on Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who was of course the young child roaming the halls of the Overlook Hotel. Now an alcoholic, Dan uses his ""shining"" power to help hospice patients pass on serenely, thus engendering the titular nickname. Out of the blue, however, Dan comes into mental contact with young Abra (Kyliegh Curran), a fellow shiner who becomes away of the True Knot, a group of vagabonds led by the enigmatic Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) who feed on such psychic powers. Together, Dan & Abra must decide whether to retreat and hide or stand and fight the True Knot.As I said in the opening, the film and novel versions of ""The Shining"" are almost their own unique properties. While King's ""Doctor Sleep"" ignores the former to focus on the latter (as is his ""right"" as original author), Flanagan doesn't make either choice and instead interweaves the two together. That is the true genius of this film, and it's greatest achievement.On one hand, Flanagan carefully handles King's 2011 material and gives it every opportunity to succeed. This certainly isn't simply an excuse to dig up nostalgia for ""The Shining"". Instead, it is first and foremost loyal to King's storytelling.On the other hand, though, it ret-cons things in one major one, that being that while the Overlook was destroyed at the end of King's Shining, it was not in Kubrick's vision. As such, the stretch run of ""Doctor Sleep"" takes place in the familiar hotel confines. While still holding true to King's overall vision, it allows a ""best of both worlds"" scenario to play out, as we are treated to some incredibly potent visuals that call back to Kubrick's cinematography.Only helping matters is solid acting all around. McGregor is a very capable lead, Curran is a fine Abra (if perhaps even a bit underutilized), and Ferguson practically steals every scene she is in. When everything comes to head in the closing moments, the acting truly had me mesmerized.To be honest, this is truly one of the best King novel adaptions I've ever seen, right up there with ""The Green Mile"". It faithfully captures the spirit of King's 2011 sequel, while also melding both ""Shining"" versions into the perfect mix of nostalgia and utilitarianism. It's disappointing and perplexing, to be honest, that ""Doctor Sleep"" did so poorly at the box office, but perhaps this is a film that can grow in stature as Flanagan continues to make a Hollywood name for himself.So, if you missed this one in theaters (as it seems most did, sadly), I can't recommend circling back to it highly enough. If you have any interest whatsoever in any aspect of the Shining, you'll find something enjoyable from all two and a half hours here.",Doctor Sleep
43,eddie_baggins,Rebecca Ferguson steals the show in this solid sequel,6,8 November 2019,"It's well documented just how much revered 1980 Stanley Kubrick classic The Shining deviated from Stephen King's source novel, so much so that King has practically dismissed the film altogether, but with sequel Doctor Sleep, King aficionado Mike Flanagan's sequel event, Flanagan ensures there's a healthy heeding to its source material whilst also balancing a hefty dosage of homage to Kubrick's beloved cinematic icon.Just as many suspected and many felt with King's sequel novel, Doctor Sleep most certainly was not a needful occurrence, we all could've live happily ever after not knowing what became of unfortunately gifted boy Danny Torrence after the events that took place with his family in the Overlook Hotel but Flanagan does enough with his faithfully established event that die-hard fans of The Shining will enjoy their time here, even if in direct comparison, this over-long feature pales when placed against Kubrick's original cinematic masterpiece.Establishing a name for himself with solid horror outings such as Oculus, Ouija: Origin of Evil and the rightfully praised Netflix series The Haunting of Hill House, Flanagan brings a steady hand to Doctor Sleep that helps ensure that it constantly feels polished and well-put together, with its surprisingly slowly paced and thoughtful beginnings a highlight, supported well by some neatly conjured up moments of terror and even some frighteningly well staged recreations of the Overlook Hotel.Those seeking genuine scares from Doctor Sleep will be left disappointed as Flanagan doesn't at all seem concerned about providing this, as he chooses to instead focus his attentions on creating an uneasy vibe throughout as he explores Danny's mental demons and battles with alcoholism, but this is a win for the film as it could've gone down the easy jump scare route to entertain mass audiences in a more commercially viable way.The tact Flanagan takes with this adaptation will be alienating to many however as it does veer more and more into self-indulgent territory as the runtime creeps along to 2 and a half hours and it's hard to suggest that Doctor Sleep fully warrants its long in the tooth runtime, that could've benefited from a solid 20 to 30 minute trim.In amongst the drawn out nature of the whole experience however is a fantastically manufactured supporting turn from Rebecca Ferguson as the film's leader of the big group The True Knot, Rose the Hat.Lighting up the screen whenever she's front and centre, other cast members like the solid Ewan McGregor and the impressive young actress Kyliegh Curran as the films new Danny Abra Stone are fine in their own rights but Ferguson is a deliciously devious delight and Flanagan finds great ways to use her and her trope of slowly aging hanger's on as they set about to extract the ""steam"" from the gifted Stone.Elevating the film to a higher level whenever she's allowed to, it's a massive bonus for the film to have Ferguson along for the ride and helps maintain the film throughout its more so-so/mediocre moments.Final Say -Very different in tone and delivery to The Shining, Doctor Sleep never comes close to matching the highs of its forefather and while this over-long film outstays its welcome as time wears on, there's enough here to warrant a viewing, especially with Ferguson creating one of 2019's most memorable villains along the way.3 seat-belts out of 5",Doctor Sleep

45,leonblackwood,"Brilliant movie, but the ending was a big let down! 7/10",7,11 March 2020,"Review:
When I heard that they were making a sequel to the Shining, I knew that it wouldn't be in the same class as Kubrick's classic, especially when I found out that Jack Nicholson wasn't involved in the project. The only saving grace was that it was based on the novel by Stephen King, so I thought that I should give it a chance. I opted to see the directors cut, which was 3 hours long, so I knew that I might be falling asleep at some point. Right from the beginning, I found the plot intriguing, and the different storylines were written to perfection. The 3 main characters, Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor), Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) and Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) was excellent, and I loved the way that their individual storylines intertwine, even though they came from completely different backgrounds. The intensity throughout the film was also brilliant, matched together with a great soundtrack that made the thrilling moments pretty scary. The only problem that I had with the film was the ending. As soon as the hotel came into play, the whole film went downhill, which was a shame because I couldn't wait for Dan & Abra to face Rose. Like the Joker, they could have easily made this a standalone movie, with nothing to do with the Shining, which would have made this a 10/10 in my eyes. Getting Henry Thomas (Elliott in E.T.) to play Jack Nicholson was a bad idea, but they did make the hotel look the same as the original, which did send chills down my spine. Although the Shining was an all-time classic, Stephen King wasn't happy with some of Kubrick's adaptations from the novel, like the ending being set in snow, which is why he worked closely with the director to get this movie right. There are a lot of questionable moments that happened in the hotel, which really let the movie down, but if you put the hotel out of your mind, the rest of the film is amazing. Personally, I think they promoted the film wrong, by calling it a sequel to the Shining because a majority of the film has nothing to do with it. Don't get me wrong, the concept is all based on the original, but you could easily watch all of the scenes before they reach the hotel, without seeing it. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this cleverly written thriller/horror, but the ending could do with a rewrite. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Mike Flanagan, who also brought you Makebelieve in 2000, Still Life, Ghosts of Hamilton Street, Absentia, Oculus, Hush, Before I Wake, Ouija: Origin of Evil and Gerald's Game. It has been reported that the underperformance of this film was due to the fact that the younger audience wasn't bothered about the Kubrick classic, and the elder audience didn't have high hopes for the film. Most of the people that saw the Shining, didn't leave the film thinking about what happened to the little boy on the bike. He was one of the film's least engaging characters, ranking somewhere between the ghostly twins and the withered hag in the bathtub. Another problem was the length of the movie, but if you watch the director's cut, it really doesn't seem that long while you're watching it. As the Shining was written while Stephen King was an alcoholic, he chose to portray his real-life feelings through Dan's character, of how he redeemed himself and became a better person. Anyway, I hope that more people will give this movie a chance, later on down the line because it's definitely worth a watch, even if you haven't seen the Shining.Budget: $45million

46,TheMovieDiorama,"Doctor Sleep may not diagnose you to the land of nod, but tediously drains your shining spirit.",6,1 November 2019,"Director Mike Flanagan had an unfathomable task. To both adapt a Stephen King novel, which is no easy achievement considering his uniquely descriptive writing style, and provide a sequel to what many describe as ""the greatest horror film of all-time"". Quenching the thirst of King's avid readers and cinephiles alike. So even without divulging my own opinion on Doctor Sleep, applause must be given for just producing this feature. That, unfortunately for Flanagan, doesn't result in myself excusing specific inexcusable filmmaking tendencies that taint, not just Doctor Sleep, but various decaying intellectual properties that have been unnecessarily drudged up again.An alcoholic scarred Dan Torrance, having endured the irrevocable dangers of the Overlook Hotel ('The Shining'), has his peace shattered when he encounters a young extrasensory girl whom is being hunted down by shine-draining monsters.First and foremost, I have not read the novel, although this should not come as a surprise. I have however, watched 'The Shining' multiple times. Now, what promotes the aforementioned horror as the best of its kind, is legendary Stanley Kubrick using the essence of King's novel and essentially making his own iteration of it. One that the renowned supernatural writer still, to this day, has mixed emotions for. So for Flanagan to introduce some faithful interpretations of Doctor Sleep, whilst maintaining the cinematic endeavour that Kubrick meticulously crafted, is as I said, unfathomable. And there's a perfectly valid reason for that. The overtly supernatural strands of the novels do not complement the genesis of terror from Kubrick's film. Which is why, with great regret, I have to report that Doctor Sleep does not work. It doesn't.A beastly behemoth that, whilst does stand on its own two legs, relies on heavy-handed storytelling techniques and nostalgia to tackle both mediums that inspired it. In tonality, they are irrefutably different from each other. But before the disappointing third act is tackled, let's address some positives first.Doctor Sleep is a shining example of depicting childhood trauma and how fragmented coping mechanisms are embedded throughout adulthood. Young Danny imaginatively designs mental traps so that he can hold the starving ghosts from the Overlook in captivity. Yet that wilful mentality does not prevent him from suffering with alcoholism, substance abuse and an insalubrious lifestyle that masquerades the trauma instead of curing it. Thematically, this is powerful, and grants the narrative a solid cohesion throughout. For the first two hours, you subconsciously warm to Danny due to the tormenting fears he has established throughout the two films. He's a pillar of ""the shining"". McGregor consistently captivated by depicting a fragile mentality through a physically demanding performance, maintaining the entranced demeanour of his younger character.The first hour, that heavily explained ""the shining"" and the intentions of the merciless antagonists The True Knot, experienced inconsistent tones due to the mass sprawl of locational change. One minute we're in a sleepy town, the next a woodland area, and then all of a sudden eight years have been and gone. The zippy nature of the editing and bloated exposition resulted in atmospheric terror being abolished. The tension was non-existent, and the imitation of Kubrick's directing style paled in comparison.Then, the second hour commenced, which is by far one of the strongest acts the year has yet to offer. Flanagan retained a surprisingly dark tone that, was so shocking, forced audience members to leave the auditorium. The mind-space of Abra, a precocious teenager who has ""shine"", produced a transcendental imaginative battle against Rose the Hat, leader of The True Knot. Ferguson, who portrayed the primary antagonist, was sensational. Equalling the likes of Pennywise as one of the most enthralling King villains ever depicted. Sinister, unrelenting and bordering on near-lunacy. Controlling every scene from just her eyes alone, she enhanced the palpable tension. She made the second act. In fact, she made the film. The interjecting gore and darkness throughout the middling act abruptly astonished me, and settled for a direction that I thought would control the underwhelming first act.The third act then arrives, and the entire story crumbles much like the Overlook itself. Plagued by an overshadowing sickness that 'The Shining' had produced. Nostalgia. Remember that time where Jack viciously chopped the bedroom door down with an axe? Or that moment where blood came hurtling through the hallways in slow motion? What about Room 237? The introductory swooping camera movement that Kubrick embraced whilst the Torrance's drove to the hotel? The typewriter? Slowly walking up the stairs in a confrontational manner? The snow-covered hedge maze? The twins? No? You don't remember? Flanagan has got you covered. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, yet it must be handled with delicacy. The difference between imitating and homaging is very fine, and unfortunately Flanagan settled for the former.So much of 'The Shining' is replicated in the third act, scene for scene, that it was a near-identical copy without the textual substance that accompanied them originally. The re-casting of the original actors, despite Essoe bettering Duvall's performance (although not difficult), felt unnecessary. Almost tarnishing 'The Shining' in itself. Danny walking through the dilapidated hallways for ten minutes whilst Flanagan incorporates identical sequences, had no purpose other than to forcefully remind you that this is the sequel. Literarily, it never progresses Danny's character or the plot. Rose the Hat staring at the blood-spewing elevators? Pointless. Danny staring at an axe encased in glass? A suitable nod to its predecessor. Do you see the difference? Between imitation and homage? The third act was littered with falsified copies, preying on the nostalgia of fans. It's uninspired. It's mundane. And it made me a dull boy.Creatively, Doctor Sleep managed to infuse the very best of its adapted novel and preceding feature, but embellished the very worst techniques when conveying the plot. Psychologically stimulating without installing dread. Extrasensory without testing the senses. Dimly shining amongst King's supernatural adaptations.",Doctor Sleep

49,digitalbeachbum,Meh,4,15 September 2021,"I think that part of my problem with not liking this movie is that The Shinning was a stand alone movie for so long. I didn't want to know all of this stuff. I was happy to have seen The Shinning, with nothing else added. I never read the books, so I was disconnected from the entire story.The casting is OK. They did as well as they could with replacing Jack Nicolson and Shelley Duvall, even the younger Danny was good, as well all the ghosts.The start of the movie, if you didn't read the books will be confusing because of the lack of connection to The Shinning. Slowly it starts to make little connections to the original movie, visuals, audio, dialog.Aside from this, there are many artistic licenses used to make this movie, which weren't in the book. Like the Overlook Hotel was already destroyed. I don't care for these types of changes. There are others, but it doesn't matter. What is done is done.The real meat of the movie starts around 1:40 to 1:50. It's the final 45 minutes of the movie which have the real entertainment even though it isn't in the book.I am glad I finally watched this movie, but it doesn't really work for me. I know there will be those who disagree with my review, but this is no master piece. A master piece has to be absolutely perfect, and with no flaws or mistakes.

52,southdavid,Shallow Grave,7,4 November 2019,"With Stephen King adaptations being very popular at the moment, and ""The Shining"" remaining the most critically adored version of one of his stories out there, a film version of his sequel novel was an obvious choice.Now grown up and having struggled with the ghosts of his past, both literally and metaphorically, for most of his life, Danny Torrence (Ewan McGregor) finally finds some peace in his troubled life. Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) is a young girl who, like Danny, exhibits strong psychic powers which brings her to the attention of the True Knot gang, who torture and kill children with these powers, to extend their own lives to unnatural lengths. Their leader, Rose The Hat, (Rebecca Ferguson) realises the power that Abra has and sets the gang to tracking her down.I was a big fan of Mike Flanaghan's Netflix series ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and a lot of the things I liked about that series appear here. It's a beautiful film, wonderfully shot and taking advantage of both CG and practical effects to create its atmosphere. Flanaghan's love for ""The Shining"" is apparent, in the recreation of the characters, set pieces and moments from the classic film. As a writer he pushes the story more to sequelise the film than the book did, rejigging the finale somewhat to that effect. Tonally, it's a lot more of a thriller than a straight horror film, though it certainly has its moments. Performances are excellent, particularly the children across the film and Rebecca Ferguson, who strikes the right balance between seductress and monster with her role.It is, however, a little bit too long and long for the sake of making a long film, rather than because the story beats necessarily required it. Looking back there are several scenes and moments that could be trimmed, or lost altogether, without negatively impacting on the core of the story. If you're there for a horror film, you will, as I suggested above, likely be disappointed. I'd also say, in retrospect, that the films isn't particularly deep - there doesn't appear to be much subtext to what happens, or if there is it passed me by.The positives outweigh the negatives on the whole though, and whilst I can't imagine myself revisiting ""Doctor Sleep"" any time soon, I would recommend the film.",Doctor Sleep

It follows up the life of an adult Dan Torrence(Ewan McGregor) who has somewhat followed his ways of his drunken father, Jack(Henry Thomas). He has the gift though, but he uses the alcohol to suppress it. He was living in Florida when a character named Rose the Hat meet a young girl then she and her following trap and feed on her essence. They are a group of energy vampires known as the True Knot who target young children who have the ""shining"" gift. They travel from state to state looking for them.
Dan left Florida to move up north following his mother's death, he remained connected with Dick Hallorann who was the victim of the Overlook Hotel massacre. When he goes to an AA meeting, he gets another encounter with a young shiner named Abra. The True Knot travel to Iowa and stalk an upcoming baseball player. Abra contacts Dan psychically, and considered him as her ""uncle"". He rebuffed hers at first because he knows about the True Knot, but Dick appears in the same room as the cat who knows the hospice patient is about to pass on. Abra, packs a psychic headache to Rose when she tries to reach in her head.
Stephen King really knows how to do it. He shows that Danny has become a man, and seek aide from another ""shiner"" to help him face his past, and protect Abra from seeing the same fate as he did.
Great flashbacks from ""The Shining"". It would be a disaster if this movie was any shorter. I enjoyed the part when Rose tried to enter Abra's mind and room only to fall into her trap. Well made, and well presented!

It felt like three movies at once with movie staring with a recap of what happen after the event of the shinning. Then we have a part where the movie goes over more what the shinning is. This part of the film acts like a Hollywood sequel as the adult version of Danny battles other people with the shinning in order or project a young girl who has it. It's almost like Stephen king's version of the X-Men. Then we have a part in the movie that brings us back to the original film and is the part with the most horror.

56,jtindahouse,"Long, dull and doesn't even feel like a 'Shining' sequel",4,3 April 2020,"As often as I can I like to see the Director's Cut of a movie over the original, because it makes sense to see what the director wanted to show you in full, rather than what he was forced to by the studio. In the case of 'Doctor Sleep' though it was a big mistake. It made an already overly long film that much longer (30 minutes longer to be exact). That might not sound like much, but when you're not enjoying a film - that is already 150 minutes long - it is an eternity.It's a bold move to call your film 'Doctor Sleep' (and yes I'm well aware this is based on a book) and then make a very dull three hour film. This is a forty year old sequel that I just don't think was needed. The original got it so right, so why tarnish that with a needless cash grab? Also, this doesn't feel like a sequel almost in any way. Sure the Shining is still present, but this feels more like a vampire story than anything else. It feels completely separate to anything that was previously created.I see that this film flopped pretty heavily at the box office and it's not hard to imagine why. A very unappealing title, Ewan McGregor - one of the dullest actors working today - in the lead role, overly long and with no clear audience to whom it was targeting. Horror fans aren't going to enjoy this - vampires were last decades thing and even that was only for emo teenagers, but drama fans aren't going to be interested either because the story isn't designed for them and also the plot is uninteresting.I can't help but feel if this weren't a sequel to 'The Shining' it would be getting absolutely savaged right now.

57,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,20 February 2021,"The problem here is that they made a sequel to the 1980 movie... and not a sequel to King's book.And, let's be honest, as good as Stanley's film was, it really had little to do with Kings novel. Almost The Shining in name only. So many changes were made, right down to the theme, that it barely resembled the book.So, when they made the sequel to the movie, and not the novel, a lot of the elements that made the Doctor Sleep compelling, a lot of the plot points, and a lot of the twists and turns that made the novel worth reading had to be changed in order to keep continuity with Kubrick's changes.The result is really kind of a mess. So much of what Doctor Sleep was referenced back to The Shining, the novel, that trying to adapt the script to the Kubrick film was, honestly, a mistake.In the end, it grasps at straws and never finds a footing, making Doctor Sleep even further removed from the story it was based on than Kubrick's film was... with far less talent directing it.",Doctor Sleep
58,Stevieboy666,Theatrical Version - very impressive,8,23 May 2020,"Long awaited follow up to the Stephen King horror classic ""The Shining"". The mixed reviews and long running time put me off watching Doctor Sleep at the cinema, but I have just enjoyed it in the comfort of my own home. I opted to go for the Theatrical Cut first, 152 minutes is a long time for a movie that fails to impress. However the time flew by, I was very impressed by the movie. Very well made and acted, plenty of horror action (I had heard people say that it's not really a horror movie, trust me it is!) and it looks great (wish I had seen it on the big screen). Ewan McGregor delivers another great performance, Rebecca Ferguson as steampunk Rose the Hat was marvellous and 14 year old Kyliegh Curran is surely a star in the making. The only slight niggle was the impersonation of Jack Nicholson in the bar tender scene, didn't quite convince.
I will certainly be giving the 3 hour Director's Cut a viewing in the near future.",Doctor Sleep
59,stevendbeard,Shining Vampires,8,9 November 2019,"I saw ""Doctor Sleep"", starring Ewan McGregor-A Million Ways to Die in the West, the Star Wars movies; Rebecca Ferguson-the Mission:Impossible movies, The Greatest Showman; Cliff Curtis-Fast & Furious Presents:Hobbs & Shaw, Live Free or Die Hard and Kyliegh Curran-this is her second movie with her first being an independent one called I Can I Will I Did.
This movie is based on a Stephen King novel that is a sequel to the 1980 The Shining. Ewan plays Danny-the son of Jack Nicholson in the Shining-as an adult. Ewan has become an alcoholic and travels aimlessly trying to forget what happened in the old hotel with his dad going a little nuts. He befriends Cliff in a small town and joins AA and gets a job working in a nursing home-that is where Ewan gets his nickname, Doctor Sleep. Meanwhile, Rebecca has been traveling with her cult like group called the True Knot across the country, in search of 'special' people that have the shine-extrasensory powers. Rebecca's group are sort of like 'Shining Vampires' that feed off their victims energy which makes them almost immortal-they have long lives but they can die if they don't feed or are killed. Kyliegh comes under their radar as a potential meal and that's when Ewan gets involved. The old hotel becomes a battlefield near the end of the film but it is not featured throughout the whole movie. FYI: Jack Nicholson's character does show up but there is someone else playing him-he is an actor you might recognize.
It's rated ""R"" for disturbing and violent content, bloody images, language, nudity and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 31 minutes-so make sure you hit the restroom before the movie.
I really liked it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Doctor Sleep
60,kevin_robbins,Wouldn't watch it a second time.,3,23 May 2021,We finally watched this today. Stephen King is out of his mind for saying this was better than The Shining. As an overall storyline it had potential. I did like the characters and acting...but the film was clumsy and bouncing all over the place. It's too bad because the special effects were solid. I'd score it a 3/10 and wouldn't watch it a second time.,Doctor Sleep

It's not a bad story but it's nor is it greatly original but it seems to have been put together with a lot of professionalism.This doesn't really feel like a sequel to the Shining which I suppose is a credit to it. It stands on its own two feet as its own story; a logical speculation on what became of Danny.I'm not a big fan of Kubrick's Shining. Just check my review...but this was OK in three viewings. Maybe in the theatre with friends or family I would have gotten immersed in it more but like i said: it's distracting enough, it's fairly well paced, it has a story to tell and at no point did I find it insulting or cheesy.I feel the antagonist could have been a lot more charismatic, original and, frankly, better acted but whatever.For all the fans of the original, yes, there is some total fanservice but you have to wait.

The cast are good, particularly Rebecca Ferguson as the nasty witch type leading the evil clan.

The story line was a little different then the original but at least we got to revisit the Overlook Hotel again.,Doctor Sleep
65,jimbo-53-186511,"Requires a bit of work, but has enough merit to make it worth the effort",6,4 November 2019,"Several years after the terrible events that took place at the Overlook Hotel Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is now an adult and is still plagued by the awful things that he witnessed their as a child (so much so that he now finds himself turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism). With the help of his neighbour Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis) Dan starts to clean up his act and gets a job at a nursing home. Things take a turn though when Dan starts communicating with Abra who, like him, also has the gift of being able to shine (only Abra is an incredibly powerful shiner) and when Dan learns about a group of drifters known as the True Knot whom are praying on fellow shiners to make themselves more powerful Abra and Dan finds themselves having to join forces to try to destroy this potentially dangerous group of people....The Shining is one of my favourite films and still remains a pretty terrifying film so clearly Doctor Sleep had a lot to live up to; it was always going to be a tall order to go toe to toe with its predecessor and the truth is that it is not as good, but in some ways it is its own beast which is the main reason its worth watching...The drawback with this film lies with the length of it and how drawn out it feels as a whole. The first half is painfully slow and at times needlessly confusing; once it did come together and I started to figure out what was happening my perception changed slightly, but it does require quite a bit of work and patience in the first half which tarnish some of the film's greatness.What is good about the film is how it develops the 'Shining' side of the story which was not really given much focus in the original. Whereas The Shining focused more on creating terror and fear, Doctor Sleep has more of a psychological feel to it allowing the viewer to get a greater understanding of 'Shining' and how powerful and dangerous it can be (in both the right and wrong hands). Whilst I liked the idea of developing 'Shining' and found it still gave the film a fairly creepy vibe I wasn't entirely sold on some elements that it brought along; some of the supernatural and body displacement scenes were a bit random and silly and other aspects were not explained too well.The final sequence of events were a mixed bag with some good and some not so good sequences; there were some scenes which felt like copycats of the original (only without the same level of terror), but as I said there were only some scenes that didn't work, but there were plenty that did.Flanagan's direction is a bit uneven; far too leisurely and drawn out in the first half, but better in the second half (even with his obvious attempts at trying to ape Kubrick at times). McGregor and Ferguson both shine (in the literal and metaphorical sense) and really do give the film a much needed lift.So overall then, it's not as good as The Shining, but as an expansion of the original story it is pretty good and as long as you're patient you should find it reasonably enjoyable.",Doctor Sleep
66,yusufpiskin,Flanagan,6,23 December 2019,"Very much 2010 to THE SHINING's 2001, a very sturdy straight-up genre sequel made by a solid, unpretentious craftsman, just about the best available version of a film nobody needed and that couldn't possibly live up to its legacy. Does a good job of reckoning with King's cornball voice and his sillier tendencies, mostly because Flanagan's formal echoes are for the most part purposeful and effective, only rarely dipping into nostalgic callbacks. I'll forgive it for not sticking the emotional landing. Rebecca Ferguson as Demon Vagabond Stevie Nicks is a hell of a mood.",Doctor Sleep

68,Pairic,Great Psychic Vampires!,9,7 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep: As a sequel this film will of course be compared to The Shining and while it might not reach those Olympian Heights it is a great film in it's own right. Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is 36 in 2011, an alcoholic, a bar room brawler, destroyed by his past, his Shining and the ghosts which haunt him. He flees to a small town where he builds a new life, working in a hospice he uses his Shining to help patients over the line. He has a cat assistant, Azzie, who knows when the patients are about to die. By 2019 his abilities also allow him to contact a young girl, Abra (Kyliegh Curran), whose even more powerful Shining has awakened. Bur Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), leader of the band of Psychic Vampires, The True Knot, also notices Abra and wants to consume her Shining (steam).Rose is a quite terrifying creature, her smile lulls her victims before she strikes, her sidekick Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind) can control peoples mind, looking like an innocent teenager. Some savage and disturbing scenes of the Vampires swooping on psychic children and literally sucking their Shining out. This Steam is also stored in flasks. Telepathic battles between Rose and Abra (and later Danny)showing their minds as filing drawers or memory palaces as they try to plunder each others memories. We also have battles where both sides use guns as well as psychic powers.Danny confronts his father's ghost in the guise of Lloyd the bartender at the Overlook Hotel. Some good effects especially the way Psychic Vampires die, the Steam rushing out of them as they vanish leaving empty clothes behind.Great performances by Ferguson and Lind but even more so by Curran who convinces when she is channeling Danny and in her battles with Rose.

Based on the Stephen King follow-up novel to his historic popular title is equal parts studio mandate & a filmmaker's slavish fealty to the Stanley Kubrick original from 1980. Taking place years after, we find Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is all grown up, a drunk & still not able to get a handle on the events that shaped his youth. Finding solace w/a friend (Cliff Curtis), he gets into an AA meeting which sorts him out for the time being until outside forces, namely a young girl, played by Kyliegh Curran, also w/a 'shine' starts reaching out to him while a cadre of vapor vampires (my friend coined that phrase) or beings that feed off the life essence of others (especially under the duress of fear) have sensed her out & being she's imbued w/a singular power, she's a force to be reckoned with & to feed on. So far so good but Flanagan gooses the proceedings by visually & aurally calling back to the iconic scenes from Kubrick's masterpiece which keeps the forward movement of the new story creeping at a halting pace. A homage is admirable but sooner or later a filmmaker will have to stand on his or her own feet to make a mark. Co-starring Bruce Greenwood (Gerald of Gerald's Game), Carel Struycken (also from Gerald's), Carl Lumbly (currently on Supergirl) & Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat.",Doctor Sleep

73,dworldeater,I like it,8,18 February 2020,"In my book Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is an untouchable masterpiece, to make a sequel(let alone 30 plus years later) to follow up on it is a fairly difficult task. Doctor Sleep is based on Steven King's follow up novel and is very different than the original film. While still remaining a horror movie, Doctor Sleep is far less terrifying than its predecessor, being Danny Torrence's story as an adult and coping with old ghosts that continue to haunt him through his life. This movie is more about his journey and the powers of The Shining which puts this somewhat in line with comic book superhero stuff that is all the rage these days. But the film is still quite dark and was put together well. I really appreciated Ewan McGregor's performance and I thought this was an interesting film that I feel was done well.",Doctor Sleep
74,s3276169,Doesn't shine.....,5,24 November 2019,"I'm really not sure why they made a shining spin off into a film. I read the book and personally found it bland. So its no surprise then, that even with a top notch cast, the cinematic spin off, would not amount to much.In my view its a trite, tedious tale of cannibalistic spirit eaters, who ensure their longevity by munching on those who shine. Why this is the case makes little sense and the link to the earlier events, found in the the first book, seems incoherent.In short, the original book and film were excellent. Doctor Sleep, by contrast, feels redundant and uninspired.I managed about 30 minutes and walked away.My advice watch and read The Shining instead. 5/10.",Doctor Sleep
75,questl-18592,Dr ZZZ,7,7 December 2019,"This is so almost a great movie. McGregor and Curran bring great performances, even though they are a bit overshadowed by Ferguson. There are some gorgeous and highly effective visuals, there's moments of pure tension and a few legitimately stunning scenes that remind me why we go to the movies.But...Maybe I need to watch it again but there was no sense of where anyone was. There's a lot of travel in this movie and there was rarely a sense of who is where or how far away things are from each other. Things like that bother me.Possibly a bigger issue though is that this movie is in a very difficult position. The Shining is oft regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best horror movies ever. Unfortunately, Doctor Sleep is haunted by that greatness and instead of just being its own thing it tries to merge the past into the presence and that just epically failed to me. Seeing the Overlook again was great, but it felt forced into a story that didn't really need it.The movie also revisits a lot of big moments from The Shining utilizing ""look-a-like"" actors instead of original footage. This was a mistake. The Shining is too well known, the original actors too unique and these new people trying to fill those shoes just feel awkward and wrong.Don't get me wrong. The good is really good and it outweighs the bad. It's just that the bad was really distracting.",Doctor Sleep
76,aidanratesmovies,Don't Miss It,10,25 February 2020,"An absolutely riveting, engaging, and spectacular thriller, Doctor Sleep makes the absolute best of its source material and is easily one of the best King adaptations in a very long time. The atmosphere is absolutely stunning, with Mike Flannagan's directing style matching perfectly with the feel and tone of the film. The cinematography also helps with this fact, by providing a beautiful somber and eerie tone that is simply breathtaking. Besides the technical achievements however, Doctor Sleep still has much to offer. The acting is quite off the charts, and impressive from all. Much to my surprise, Ewan McGregor is fantastic as Danny Torrance in the film, which is almost essential cause the film largely relies on him. McGregor has always been a great actor, but at first glance I had my doubts of him in the role, but he largely proved them wrong. Kyleigh Curran and Rebecca Ferguson are two other great standouts whose roles transcend the screen in ways we haven't seen till now. The film is quite long, with a 2hr 32min runtime, but it oddly leaves you wanting more and curious to fill the gaps cut due to the long screen time. This aside however, the film does a pretty well job at balancing those elements, and is certainly entertaining enough to let you hold on till the end. To be completely honest, I was blown away by the film in its entirety, expecting very little from it, and not being a huge fan of The Shining film itself. However, I am a huge King fan and I was absolutely delighted to see his work handled with such care and craftsmanship, so an absolute well done to those involved making the film, especially Haunting of Hill House director Mike Flanagan. In the end, Doctor Sleep is an absolutely refreshing and terrific ride that is unlike anything that has touched the screen before. The actors put their mark on these continuing and new characters in great new ways, and Flannagan's directing is simply brilliant. The film is largely entertaining for its runtime, and handles its pacing surprisingly well. It's an absolute blast, criminally underappreciated, and highly recommended as one King fan to the next.

77,truemythmedia,Better than I Ever Had Hoped,8,30 December 2019,"""DO NOT go into this movie expecting a sequel to Kubrick's ""The Shining""; that would be an incredibly foolish thing to do. You can't go into this film expecting anything close to Kubrick's level of filmmaking, because while Flanagan is a competent horror director (check out ""Oculus"" or Netflix's ""Haunting of Hill House"") , he doesn't hold a candle to Kubrick. This is not a perfect film; far from it. At the same time, this film still receives a 4/5 star rating from me because it managed to capture the spirit of the novel and replicate some of the atmosphere created by Kubrick, plus it did so in a way that was respectful to both storytellers. This isn't a great movie; it's not even the best Stephen King adaptation to come out in the past decade (I really liked ""It Chapter I""), but it is far better than I ever expected it to be.",Doctor Sleep

80,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Follow Up and Meshing of Classics,10,12 November 2019,"This was a film that when I heard it announced, I was stoked. I read the book when it came out and really dug what Stephen King did in continuing the story of Danny Torrance from his years after the events of The Shining. Casting of Ewan McGregor I thought was interesting as I know he's solid as an actor so that is definitely a perk as well. The first viewing was at the Gateway Film Center and for my second viewing, it was when I picked up the Blu-Ray pretty cheap and Jaime was interested in seeing it. The synopsis is now-adult Dan must protect a young girl with similar powers from a cult known as The True Knot, who prey on children with powers to remain immortal.We start this in Florida back in 1980. A young girl is with her mother and she goes to pick flowers. By the water she encounters Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). She shows her a magic trick and end up kidnapping her in the process. It then shifts to Danny (Roger Dale Floyd). He is terrified to go to the bathroom as he sees the woman from room 237 from the Overlook Hotel in there. This causes him to urinate in his pants. His mother, Wendy (Alex Essoe) through this talk and other interactions, we learn that he hasn't spoken since. She does comfort and get him cleaned up.Danny is visited by Dick Hallorann (Carl Lumbly), who shares a way to make these entities go away. He creates boxes in his mind and locks them inside. Danny then grows to be an adult and is much like his father. We see him on a bender where he wakes up next to a woman. She has vomited and he goes to leave. Before he can, he sees that she has a child. This doesn't stop him from taking money as he feels she took his. Danny boards a bus that takes him to New Hampshire. It is there that he meets Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis). He sees something in Danny and decides to help him.We also meet a special little girl, Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran). She is much like Danny was, just way more powerful. Her parents are shocked at a magic trick she does in the kitchen where she has all of their spoons stuck to the ceiling. Her parents are David (Zackary Momoh) and Lucy (Jocelin Donahue).8 years later, Dan is sober and working at a nursing home where he is dubbed Doctor Sleep. Along with their cat, they know the patients who are close to passing and helping to ease their fears. Dan also communicates with Abra through a wall in his room. It has been painted like a chalkboard. Things take a turn though when Abra picks up the energy of Rose the Hat and her convoy of people. She see first that they convert a trouble teen, Snakebite Andi (Emily Alyn Lind), to join them and then we see how they eat when they come after Bradley Trevor (Jacob Tremblay). Abra then seeks out Dan for his help, because she is the most powerful person who can use The Shine and that's what the True Knot wants.Now you already know that I was pretty excited to see this film from what I said. I heard some interesting things from people before I got the chance to see this and I actually have to agree. The first thing is that it is common knowledge that King didn't care for the Stanley Kubrick version of his story. What I find interesting about this film is that it seems like the perfect love letter meshing Kubrick's The Shining with King's 'Doctor Sleep' and then still putting his own touches on it for this movie.It really is an interesting story to have these villains in the True Knot as they search for children that can use The Shine. They call it Steam, as that's what it looks like when it is coming out of them. They're really stealing the soul and with the changes that are made in them, as long as they eat well, they can live much longer than rubes which are normal people. The things they do are pretty cruel so that really adds to the fear. They want the children to be in pain as it makes the Steam more pure for them, which is horrific.There's also some really interesting social commentary here, which if you know me, I love. We see that Dan's way of dealing with his father's alcoholism is drinking. It is interesting as his father died when he was a boy, but he still followed in the footsteps. He has a bit more of an excuse being that he has this mental ability that is scary so it's him dealing with that as well. His alcoholism did hide him from the True Knot in part as well. The traumatic events made him not use it so they missed him. This feels like something that anyone who lives into adulthood might end up as alcoholics because of the strain the Shine can have on them.This film also has some good heart. Seeing Dan recover from his issues with booze and what he does at this nursing home touched my heart. I'm not going to lie, I teared up for some of this as it is that heartfelt. It really does add an interesting touch and plays up later when he finally meets Abra as well.I want to shift gears to cover the pacing and editing of this film. As I said that this was a love letter to the film and book, there are so many good references throughout. We see scenes that were reshot for this film, but on top of that, we get ones that directly mirror. An example is when Dan interviews with Dr. John (Bruce Greenwood) are exactly like Jack's interview at the Overlook. It is things like this that were great. This film also runs 152 minutes, but I didn't mind it at all. I felt like that time was needed to introduce us to the characters and then build the tension to their eventual encounter. I love where it ends up and actually, I think using the Kubrick's ending makes more sense than the King ending as I really enjoy the encounter as they do here. How this all plays out in the end works for me.That will take me to the acting of this one. McGregor I think did an excellent job as the adult Dan. He really brings hurt and pain to the character from what happened in the original film and the repercussions after it. Ferguson was also amazing as Rose. There's an odd aspect that I found her really attractive, but also terrified of her at the same time. I could almost believe her at times which is weird since I know she's evil. Curran I thought was solid as well. She does some interesting things like pretending to be Dan. Despite her age, she holds her own with the performances around her. Seeing the True Knot how they operate converting Lind was solid and the rest of the group was good as the villains. I like the performances of Curtis, Greenwood, Essoe and Tremblay. They along with the rest of the cast rounded this film out for what was needed. I should also really shout out Essoe, Floyd, Thomas Downing and Henry Thomas amongst others. They took on roles from The Shining for reshoots here. They were definitely solid and it helped to build on the tension and back-story.As for the effects of this film, I thought they were on point. We get some really good practical ones. The blood we see looks good and writer/director Mike Flanagan seems to be a master of ripping the skin of wrist and hands, because we got a scene of that which made me cringe. Going even farther, the CGI in this film was really good as well. It was seamless and I know it was with computers because of what was done, but that's really the only way. I thought it was shot beautifully and I like the incorporation of seeing inside of the mind. It really sucked me in.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I love that Flanagan decided to use songs from the original film and then tweaked some of them here. It really helps to build tension. On top of that though, they also use this heartbeat that happens quite a bit. I could feel my anxiety going up when it would get more rapid and I thought that was genius thing to use. On top of that, Jaime specifically said the same thing that it was making her anxious and she felt like her breathing was syncing up to it.Now with that said, I was excited to see this, but was also nervous that my love of the original film and the source material from King would affect it. I can definitely say that it didn't. This film sucked me in and I think that Flanagan knocked it out of the park again. The story was some good social commentary of real life issues and then blends it well with the supernatural. Seeing how trauma changes people is interesting here and I think the acting helps bring that to life. Despite its long runtime, it doesn't feel like it and I think that it definitely was warranted. The effects were good and the soundtrack was amazing. There were just a few things that were off for me, but nothing to ruin it or the things that I liked. I think this is a great film and it is a contender for one of the best of the year for me. It really has gone up after this second viewing. For my third will be the director's cut as well.",Doctor Sleep
81,davidmvining,"Thematically weighty, involving, and a great watch",8,30 November 2019,"When these 30-40 year later sequels happen with intelligence by filmmakers who understand the original and how to continue the stories in new ways, good things can happen. Some prime early examples could be The Hustler's sequel The Color of Money and Scenes from a Marriage's sequel Saraband. Well, in a combination of hate and love we get Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining nearly forty years later, and I am quite pleased.If there was one event meant to screw up someone's life forever, it would be your father going mad, trying to kill you and your mother, all while ghosts tried to harm you in a haunted hotel in the middle of a blizzard in the middle of nowhere, and that's exactly what happened to Danny Torrance. Thirty years later, he's a mess of a man, finding the only way to deal with his psychic powers that played a part in the whole affair is to drown them with drink. Once he reaches rock bottom, he finds himself in a small town in New Hampshire where a good local named Billy helps him get back on his feet and sober.What makes this opening so fascinating for Danny is the parallel treatment of the shining ability Danny has and is trying to forget about as well as the trauma of that seminal event of his youth. This is where the thematic core of the movie resides. The piece of genre storytelling (the psychic ability) is a stand in for the human emotion (trauma), and the two mesh exceedingly well.On the other side of that theme is Rose the Hat and her gang, True Knot, who eat the shine of those they find in order to extend their own lives. There are hints that some of Rose's companions have lived for thousands of years doing this. Instead of standing to face their mortality, they constantly roam, looking for those with gifts to consume. Where Danny ends up finding ways to face the horrors of his past in order to live fully, Rose and True Knot consume the shine of others in order to simply continue existing. They have no real lives other than their search for the next bit of smoke that will give them some few more months of life.Caught between them is Abra, a young girl with extremely impression powers. She and Danny made a connection without ever meeting once Danny turned away from drink and let the shine back into his life in some limited way. Abra also makes a connection with Rose, but the connections are of strikingly different varieties. With Danny, Abra develops a familial and kind relationship where Danny helps Abra navigate her powers and the dangers that Rose the Hat represent. And Rose does represent a danger. When she first makes a connection with Abra, as Abra psychically witnesses Rose's murder of an 11 year old boy 1500 miles away, Rose knows that Abra is the whale of a catch. She will do anything to get Abra and her life force. It's the sort of well that Rose could mine for a very long time.So begins the struggle between the man, the woman, and the girl between. The chase extends from New Hampshire to Iowa back to New Hampshire to New York and finally to Colorado, a rather constant travelogue that bugged me ever so slightly. The parties get whittled down to just our core three characters before Danny decides that the final confrontation has to happen at the Overlook Hotel ruins.The very first scene of the movie introduces an idea, presented by a ghostly Mr. Hallorann to a young Danny Torrance, of trapping the ghosts that haunt Danny into mental boxes. By the time we meet him as an adult, he's trapped many of these ghosts who have followed him from the Overlook, and it's obvious that these boxes are going to open at some point. I have to say that I loved their use in the film. They represent Danny's trauma, and he uses them to fight Rose the Hat. It's a great and intelligent use of imagery.The whole final half hour or so is set in the Overlook, and it is so much more than mere fan service. I do think the reasoning for actually going feels a little thin, but once there, it's tightly plotted and contains both genre thrills and a fantastic scene between the adult Dan and the ghost of Jack, his father. Jack takes the place of Lloyd the bartender, and instead of merely offering Danny a drink, as Lloyd had done with Jack, this new Lloyd practically forces it upon Danny. However, Danny is too strong, having grown too strong, and the Overlook turns on him.The story is really Danny's and Ewan McGregor plays him well. He starts the film damaged and rather awful while full of self-hatred, but he becomes fatherly to Abra over time. Kyleigh Curran is quite good as Abra as well, but, in terms of acting, it's Rebecca Ferguson who steals the show as Rose the Hate. She is fantastically cold, smart, driven, and evil. She's wildly watchable.There are some bits that bugged me, though. The travelogue irritated me, and I can't give a great reason for that, but it's still there. I also feel like this is a sequel that leans really heavily on its predecessor to the point that if you don't know The Shining pretty well, there is a significant chunk of the film (most of the ending) that may end up falling kind of flat. It may not be a huge ask of the audience to be familiar with one of the most famous and iconic horror movies ever made, but I do wish it hadn't needed to rely on The Shining quite so much.Other than that, though, the movie's a very good time. It's smartly written, well structured, looks quite good (though over-relies on close ups, to be honest), and quite well acted (especially from Ferguson). While it may play more as a drama than a horror movie for most of its runtime, Doctor Sleep works really well.",Doctor Sleep
82,jadepietro,Fatigued,4,14 November 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A weak sequel that cannot come near its original inspired source.JIM'S REVIEW: Many ghosts and cinematic memories haunt Mike Flanagan's sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 classic horror film, The Shining, but not in a good way. Doctor Sleep, the disappointing supernatural thriller, pales by comparison. Kubrick he's not, but Mr. Flanagan sets the bar high, even if it is out of his reach.In this second installment, Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) has grown up from his traumatic childhood dealing with his gift of the ""shining"", the ability to see otherworldly worlds. As an adult, he has hit rock bottom. Now a loner and alcoholic, his psychic visions still remain intact as he drifts from one town to another. One day, Dan receives a telepathic message from a young girl named Abra (sans the ""cadabra""). No magic here, just bad news about a wandering vampire-like cult that kidnaps, tortures, and kills young children. Not a happy subject. This motley crew, known as the True Knot, is led by Rose the Hat, a truly evil and menacing villain (nicely played by Rebecca Ferguson). As this band of misfits literally sucks the life out of these young innocents, it all leads to a predictable finale of good versus evil at the infamous Overlook Hotel.As a director, Mr. Flanagan certainly has the skill and experience with the suspenseful horror genre. While his resume has an unevenness, he has previously scored very effectively in the past with sleeper hits like Hush and Gerald's Game, another Stephen King source. But this film meanders as it tries to bring plot strands together. The movie flatlines and clings to life support with barely a pulse, unless one can call the movie's overwrought music score by the Newton Brothers and an ominous and intrusive heart beat sound that acts as a non-stop foreboding danger signal. Annoying, absolutely...Contrived, yes...Scary, no! (And that goes to the cheesy CGI as well.)Mr. Flanagan creates some scenes that begin promisingly, but his script is bloated and in need of numerous rewrites. (In fact, the movie's 15 minute flashback prologue is slow and dull, only adding to the film's lengthy screen time.) All the subplots, flashbacks, and exposition are heavy-handed and take the narrative longer than necessary to come together.However, a fine cast of actors play their roles with a sense of commitment, such as the aforementioned Mr. McGregor (a usually underrated actor who delivers a strong portrayal) and the winning Ms. Ferguson. Plus Kyliegh Curran, Cliff Curtis, Carl Lumbly, Zach McClarnon, Jacob Tremblay, and an underused Emily Alyn Lind as Snakebite Andi, a sinister member of the True Knot work diligently to overcome their stock characters. But the material just doesn't merit their respective talents.Still the supporting characters remain sketchy and when the film tries to align its new performers by substituting Jack Nicholson / Shelley Duvall lookalikes, the overall effect at the Overlook is looking, well...overdone. (It also doesn't help to include a short image of a younger Jack Nicholson from Kubrick's original film. A very unwise directorial choice compromises the movie very quickly, making one yearn for the original source.) The constant references (and there are many) to Kubrick's far superior film undercut any tension, although the production design of the old decaying hotel with its maze-like hallways is well designed by Maher Ahmad.Succinctly put (unlike this film), Doctor Sleep is a yawn.",Doctor Sleep

Graphic Violence That is Haunting But DisturbingThe VERDICTI have to agree with my friends who saw the film, Doctor Sleep is one of the better novel interpretations that I have seen in quite a while. My favorite aspects of this film are how much like a book it plays out, yet never sacrifices the entertainment factors and visualization components that films need. A haunting atmosphere to play in, with great characters to bring out the solid story, I feel many King and horror films will be impressed with the presentation of this tale. While the run time is a little longer than expected, and the scares are at a minimum compared to the first film I watched a long time ago, the true component to warn people about is the graphic violence/torture that may haunt your memories for some time. It's true I would have liked a little more of the Shining aspect, but overall a solid story telling from King and company again. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely, as it has theater quality effects and good storytelling for most audience members to enjoy.My scores are:Drama/Fantasy/Horror: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0",Doctor Sleep
84,Kamurai25,"""To Prey, Perhaps to Dream""",9,7 August 2020,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.I honestly wasn't excited about this one, so my expectations were low. I didn't realize it was Stephen King, let alone a sequel to ""The Shining"" until I watched it. I'm also not a big fan of ""The Shining"", but I haven't watched it since I learned to watch a movie critically.After hearing about ""shining"" from everyone, I immediately got excited when I realize that was what this movie was all about. I've been waiting for this movie since ""Push"". This movie is honestly what ""Star Wars: Episode I"" should have been. This is how you give an explanation of how super powers work on a large scale: you tell a story that examples it, ""do not say"", it is how movies are supposed to work.This was wonderfully casted: Ewan McGregor, Kyliegh Curran, and Rebecca Ferguson are amazing. There deliveries have weight to them, and it really makes the movie.The production value is fantastic, they definitely didn't spare a cent to make this look as good or nostalgic as it needed to be.There are aspects of the story I think we could have done without, mostly just for time purposes, and there are portions of the story that are just gratuitously graphic, and some of those two things overlap, but I'm not going to say that any of the movie would actually be better for it. The story, whether it be the movie or from the book, is exceedingly well paced, and powerful, every step of the way.It has this wonderful theme of predators and prey, basically ""There's always a bigger fish"", but in a twisted, looping way.If you can stand horror at all and like psychic powers, then definitely give this a watch.",Doctor Sleep

Scenes are much longer, and there are chapter titles as well as an afterword by the film's director thanking the audience for watching the version.",Doctor Sleep
86,Kingslaay,Not too bad,7,8 November 2020,It is always difficult to do a follow up of a masterpiece. The Shining is easily one of the greatest films ever made. Some directors wouldn't touch such a film. However Stephen King did write a sequel and this presented an opportunity. The film is both interesting and intriguing. A universe or world has been built around the central character Danny and his ability to shine. Viewers of the classic will remember the Overlook Hotel and all its horrors. Doc's ability to Shine can be forgotten at times. But given the original film and book title 'The Shining' and this ability its logical and interesting to follow this storyline. It is for this reason why the Overlook was beside itself because of this sense. It is not a big hit on its own but Doctor Sleep has some merit and does well.,Doctor Sleep
87,vengeance20,Uh...,4,3 November 2019,"Seen The Shining years ago on DVD & found it to be pretty boring, slow & not really as great as many were saying.Now suddenly after 39 years, we get a sequel to the 1980 film & I have to say while it's slightly more entertaining, I can't help but feel like it still has the same dragging lethargic feel to it.The film centers around Dan Torrance who after 39 years is still tormented by the events of the Overlook hotel back in 1980. The villain in this film is The Hat Lady & while not a bad villain, still underwhelming to say the least & not exactly sinister.The story-line is hard to follow, while simple, the dragged out pacing & lethargic story telling made the story harder to understand. The visuals however, were great & sinister looking. But aside from that, the film dragged too much unfortunately & was more of a chore to watch.4/10 Not the greatest.",Doctor Sleep

I ended up liking it.It seemed a bit more explanatory than ""The Shinning"" but it didn't have the same sense of dread. It just wasn't as creepy but when I got to thinking about it, I kinda liked it this way. I liked that Danny had grown up, learned to overcome some of his fears and be able to do what he needed to do for the benefit of another.It's not perfect but I suppose some folks would still complain even if it was perfect. I'll probably recommend it to my friends and I will end up watching it again. It worked for me.",Doctor Sleep
91,Abdulxoxo,Darn impressive,8,11 January 2021,"This film's first half hour or so is quite slow and meandering. However, with the introductions of Abra and Rose the Hat into the main plot, things started to get interesting. I like Abra's character and the way in which she is a young girl with an extraordinary power that she didn't quite know what to do with. Her journey of self discovery throughout this film was a joy to watch. Ewan McGregor may be the lead actor in this film, and he is really good, but it's Rebecca Ferguson that steals the whole movie, who plays one of the best, most rounded, villains I've seen in recent years. The way she gleefully toys with her victims is horrendous, yet twistedly entertaining to watch. The other thing I enjoyed is the return to the Overlook Hotel, I thought they used the location perfectly to emphasize the story of the characters we have gotten to know over the first two hours of the film. The film also digs deeper into the lore of the shining, exploring what it is, what it can do and how it can sometimes be more of a detriment than a power.
All in all, I'm impressed by this movie, if I have to choose between Doctor Sleep and The shining, I'd surely pick the former without a hitch. The characters, performances, story and all the technical elements are darn impressive.",Doctor Sleep

93,arungeorge13,"A not-bad, not-great sequel to The Shining! [+53%]",5,25 January 2020,"Doctor Sleep is a partially entertaining sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror classic The Shining. Written and directed by Mike Flanagan (of Oculus, Gerald's Game, Ouija 2, and Hush), the film appears to be a weird blend of his atmospheric film-making style (which I love) and King's (mostly awkward) horror fantasies. I watched the 3-hour long director's cut of the film. As the run-time already reveals, it's a slow-burn psychological horror flick that doesn't rely too much on nostalgia from The Shining. Well, for the most part, it doesn't.Ewan Mcgregor plays the adult Danny Torrance, who in the present day, has tried his best to move on from the nightmarish incidents that took place at the Overlook Hotel. The film, according to King, stays faithful to the novel a lot more than Kubrick's version ever did. I think this has worked both in favor of and against it. For starters, even with all its eerie atmosphere amid the modern-day setting, it doesn't give you the chills that The Shining did. There's no Jack Nicholson-level savagery in the film that makes your pupils dilate or scares that make your hair stand up.That being said, I'm glad Flanagan didn't choose to add frequent jumpscares and water down the atmosphere he tries to build. On the other hand, it was really difficult for me to buy into Rebecca Ferguson's Rose the Hat as a compelling antagonist. She's ravishing in the initial scene where she lures a child into her witch-trap, but in the latter hours, her character ends up looking too vulnerable. I wasn't fond of that notion at all. I still stand by Hitchcock's rule that a stronger antagonist creates a stronger film.Kyliegh Curran is essentially the new Danny Torrance here, minus the daddy issues. She handles her role of Abra Stone, a little 'shiner', with ease. Being a sequel to the cult-classic, I enjoyed how Flanagan tackled the recreation of certain imagery from The Shining, including neat references to the source material as well as Kubrick's efforts. There are both older and newer demons for Dan to fight in Doctor Sleep, and Mcgregor's version of the character does have an intentionally restrained feel to it. The sudden bursts of shock and awe in the screenplay are when the film gets engaging; otherwise, the going is too slow to care.Doctor Sleep will not be considered a film that gives you many (or any) sleepless nights, but I was aghast on seeing how a victim of The True Knot cult (the one led by Rose the Hat) was subjected to a slow and painful death. Flanagan and King want you to understand how evil works here more than trying to scare you upfront. As a cinematic effort, Doctor Sleep falls somewhere in between. I think that look on the face of Shelley Duvall when being followed by a deranged, axe-wielding Jack Nicholson sends greater shivers down my spine as compared to anything that I witnessed in Doctor Sleep.",Doctor Sleep
94,martimusross,A Really Great And Gripping Movie,7,3 November 2019,"Doctor SleepThis was a really great movie and was quite capable of standing on its own even if you hadn't watched The Shining. The script was well thought out with the bad guys being kind of death eater vampires prolonging their long lives by living off ""steam"" the shine of supernatural powers.Ewan McGregor threw his all into the project with a detailed study of an ordinary man who sought to suppress his supernatural abilities with drink and drugs. He turned into our hero when a vulnerable young girl needed his help.The bad gang was led by Rose The Hat, Rebecca Ferguson who also gave a great performance.Overall everything was good, the music, the special effects, the directing, the plot.

102,one9eighty,Doctor drifting off but not quite feeling rewarded the next morning,6,25 November 2020,"In 1980 Stanley Kubrick adapted a 1977 Stephen King novel called ""The Shining"" into a successful horror film. Stephen King was never quite happy about how the film turned out, so in 1997 King wrote and produced a version of his novel into a TV miniseries. Fast forward to 2019 and Mike Flanagan brings us an adaptation of King's 2013 sequel to the original novel, ""Doctor Sleep"". Flanagan admitted that he had to do justice to King's 2013 novel, while using both the 1980 film, and the 1997 mini-series as source material for what he was directing in the 2019 release.Confused yet??After experiencing the events at the Outlook Hotel in 1980 Dan Torrance is still traumatised as an adult. Initially his various bad habits, such as alcohol dependency do not sate his visions and feelings, but he learns a new tactic from the spirit of Dick Halloran that allows him to imprison the spirits that haunt him. After reaching rock bottom the only way is up, and Danny (now going as Dan) follows an instinct which takes him to a new life in New Hampshire. He joins an AA group and slowly starts building his life back together, taking a job as a hospice orderly where he uses his powers to reassure the people dying - thus earning him the name ""Doctor Sleep"". One day he is contacted by somebody else who has powers too. While all this is going on, we meet Rose the Hat, who is part of a group called the 'True Knot'. They feed on the 'steam' of kids they torture who possess powers/a shining. Feeding on the steam keeps them young and allows them to live for longer than their bodies would normally allow. They have their sights on the stranger who has contacted Dan, a young girl called Abra. She tells Dan, who decides to help her escape the True Knot. Complications arise which mean Dan must think on his feet, and he eventually decides to take Abra to the Overlook hotel - a place which might be dangerous, but one where Dan knows the environment. A battle ensues pitting Dan and Abra against Rose the Hat, while the spirits at the Overlook hotel try to claim them too.Ewan McGregor plays the grown-up Dan Torrance (with the young Danny played by Roger Dale Flloyd), who was originally played by Danny Lloyd - who does make a small cameo in the film too. McGregor does well without ever really excelling, he is a great actor, but I prefer him in other films I have seen him in. Rebecca Ferguson plays Rose the Hat - for me she is the real standout in the film. She is a great villain and flips between warm and welcoming and maniacal and twisted superbly. Kyliegh Curran plays Abra Stone, with Dakota Hickman also playing her, albeit the younger version seen early on in the film. She does well for someone so young, but there are times where her delivery of the script felt a little forced. It was not a terrible thing and I only noticed it at times. I am sure she has a bright future ahead of her though. - I just wonder if there was a lot of pressure put on her to deliver things in a particular way. Carl Lumbly takes over from Scatman Crothers as Dick Halloran, which felt natural and did not feel out of place at all. The role of Wendy Torrance goes from Shelley Duvall to Alex Essoe. Henry Thomas plays the Overlook bartender called Lloyd who was originally played by Joe Turkel, who also has the face of Jack Torrance - who was Jack Nicholson in the first film. Other top talent is littered throughout too, all of whom do great jobs in their performances.Any less confused yet?This is a decent film, that kept me engaged throughout. It is less of a horror film and more of a drama pitting good versus evil, the acting is decent, and the imagery is good. I liked that new actors were cast in some of the reoccurring roles, using digital might have been a little off-putting. I watched this without expecting it to be as dark and gritty as the Kubrick 1980 film. With a low expectation I anticipated that I could only be surprised and enjoy the film, and that I did in parts. It was a little drawn out at times, and also a bit obvious in places, but that's the direction that modern films seem to have gone - signposting what is coming up rather than just springing it on the audience. The story telling is king here, which is reassuring as it is also written by a King too. Seeing how the Danny/Dan character had developed was strangely satisfying - turning out like his dad, only to try and change himself out of that mould as the film progressed. Watching Rose the Hat, and how that character developed was great too. Despite those two admissions I wonder if I should not have been more engaged in the Abra character, after all she is the new generation of power that could take things forward if future films were to be made.The gap between the novels and the previous film/TV series is bridged well under the helmsmanship of director Mike Flanagan and he gives us something which has the ability to stand on its own two feet. Will this be a classic in years to come like Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" though? Time will obviously tell but I doubt it. A good film which takes the audience on a decent journey that had me engaged for the 3 or so hours it was on, but not one that will haunt me like the original's did (both novel and film). A visually appealing film with some well-crafted dream-like sequences, but still not as memorable as what was experienced in the Overlook during Kubrick's time at the wheel. The first act sets the film up and explains things to the audience, it was decent but not brilliant. Then the second act sets up what this film was going to do and starts the ball rolling - and it was good enough. The third act which was supposed to be the big climax didn't fully deliver for me though, it felt like it was an overdose of nostalgia and did not really satisfy my need for a great conclusion to the film.Ultimately the film is decent without being outstanding. Some good performances, some decent imagery, a good enough story that differs from what the audience might have expected and cried out for in a sequel. This does bridge a gap between film, TV, and the novels quite well, but it for me it isn't going to be as celebrated in years to come as the work that came before it.",Doctor Sleep
103,educallejero,"Superb (even if for some, a bit slow)",10,14 December 2019,"An amazing construction of the story with every scene being essential, and not because they are full of needed exposition (which can make them dull). The amount of characters presented allowed the writer(s) to tell us what was necessary to understand the story in a natural way.

The script is the best part of the whole thing.The acting is pretty good too, especially the McGreggor and Kyliegh Curran.Maybe the weakest part are the references to the Stanley Kubrick version. At times it feels they are forced into the movie just to connect them and for marketing purposes.And yet, thanks to the excellent thid act, it all ends up feeling totally necessary and complementary to the story , which is where the King's novels based movies often fail.

104,aciessi,Overlooked Hotel,5,10 November 2019,"I'm not sure if this is going to make sense, but here we go. Doctor Sleep, as a standalone horror film is really good. But as a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, it is really bad. The trick to enjoying it is to see it purely as a Mike Flanagan film, which it quintessentially is. But Doctor Sleep, in so many scenes, attaches itself to the 1980 masterpiece. This was a MASSIVE mistake. It's disrespectful to the legacy of the Shining, and it simply wasn't needed.What works about the movie? The acting comes to mind. Ewan McGregor is a perfect casting decision to play adult Danny Torrance. Kyleigh Curran is a knockout as Abra Stone. Together, they pair up well as a team of Shiners, as they hunt down a wild hippy cult of spirit eaters. Doctor Sleep has many thrills, scares and creepy moments. They all pay off well. The story itself is investing for the entirety of it's 152 minutes. A long run time like that can feel like a punishment if the film is completely uninteresting, and Doctor Sleep isn't for a second. The writing flows gracefully. The visual effects are chilling. This is one of the rarer instances of a commercial horror film thats firing on all cylinders.But (sigh) we have to go back to Kubrick. We have to, only because Doctor Sleep insists on it. From the opening minutes, Kubrick is being invoked. Some scenes are archived straight from the original film, and some, shockingly, are recreated with new actors portraying the classic roles. That is just disgraceful, and unacceptable. I hated it. It took me out of a fairly good horror movie. Why couldn't they just leave it alone? The Shining didn't need to be touched up for a 2019 audience. Some movies are just too sacred. However, I can give them credit for flawlessly reconstructing the Overlook Hotel, right down the patterns on the wall. Well done on production design. Not to mention, they found an exact duplicate of Scatman Crothers to reprise Dick Hallormann.",Doctor Sleep
105,rockman182,Doctor Sleep (2019),8,10 November 2019,"I only found out a few months ago that Stephen King wrote a sequel to The Shining. Stanley Kubrick is one of my top three directors of all time, so it goes without saying that I loved The Shining. Its a really effective horror/thriller with imagery that has survived the decades of cinema that have followed. So, creating a sequel to one of the most celebrated horror films ever was going to be a daunting task for any filmmaker. Mike Flanagan who did quite a job with films like Oculus and Ouija: Origin of Evil took the reigns and its a good thing as well because I think he did a very good job with Doctor Sleep.The film takes places decades after the events of The Shining and the terrifying events in the Overlook hotel. Dan Torrance is now an adult on the path to sobriety. He has learned to lock away the demonic presences that plague his mind but is contacted by a young girl who can also ""shine."" They form a bond but the young girl is being chased by a cult of beings that murder children and feed on their psychic powers. Dan now finds himself using his powers to protect her from this new evil.As soon as the film opened with the infamous Shining theme I was in. The film is two and a half hours long yet it flew by for me, because I was purely invested in all of it. The performances are great and I loved Rebecca Ferguson's recent streak as a movie villain. The cult of murderers she leads are pretty terrifying in what they do. The imagery and effects in this film are eye popping, its a wonderful film to look at. The film has so much originality to it to work as a stand alone film but Mike Flanagan still chose to use set pieces and recreations from the original film. I am still mixed about this. While I don't feel like it was necessary to call back to the original film as much as he does, I still found a nostalgic element to it and was wondrously watching.I'm trying to think of things about the film I can nitpick about but I'm struggling to come up with anything. Flanagan tells a story and brings images to life in a very satisfying way, while creating a work that has the right to stand in this new Shining universe. I had reservations like many when a sequel was announced but Doctor Sleep works in every way I wanted it to. This is exactly where you would figure Dan Torrance would be as an adult, and I'm glad to have gotten more insight into the mythos of The Shining and the spirits associated.8/10",Doctor Sleep

The original ""Shining"" from 1980 was much better.",Doctor Sleep
107,RforFilm,"The tones may not always match, but Doctor Sleep is an entertaining sequel that should make ghost story fans happy",7,12 November 2019,"If your father went inside a hotel, went insane and tried to kill you, what are the odds your going to grow up normal? Certainly not in the world of Stephen King. Young Danny Torrance in The Shining may have had psychic powers, but certainty couldn't predict what would happen to his dad and even everything else that would happen afterward. I wouldn't matter for a while as The Shining only told the story in the moment and didn't see to find out what would happen to the child who went through an experience that no one, if any, have.People certainly know the classic novel and more know the famous Kubrick adaptation from 1980. It remains one of the greatest horror movies even though Stephen King himself didn't like it. His complaint was that the movie didn't explore enough of Jack's character enough and only made him out to be a psycho on the inside. It's a legitimate criticism, but we still have the novel. It was famous enough that Stephen King wrote a sequel that follows Danny Torrance in Doctor Sleep. Unlike the book which follows The Shining novel, Doctor Sleep incorporates the Kubrick movie in an attempt to bridge gaps.In the years since the traumatic experience at the hotel, Danny Torrance (played by Ewan McGregor) has become al alcoholic mess who still dwell with bad memories and the occasional ghost. The ghost of Dick Hallorann (played by Carl Lumbly) did teach him how to lock away the spirits with his shining. Still, Danny stumbles his way to New Hampshire where he not only stays, but also decides to get help for his problems. Cut to eight years later where Danny now works at a hospice caring for the patients, but also acquiring the nickname ""Doctor Sleep"" for his ability to ease them into death.At the same time, a woman named Rose the Hat (played by Rebecca Ferguson) runs a cult called the True Not, where she and her members find children with ""the shining"" and consume their ""steam"" in order to slow down their own aging. Though they've never known about Danny, they kidnap a boy in Iowa, when a girl Abra (played by Kyliegh Curran) seems to sense them, but can also sense Danny. She tracks him down and talks about the two of them taking out the True Not, even if this means returning to the abandoned Overlook Hotel.I've read Doctor Sleep and I can say the movie does a good job translating the story into something more cinematic. Stephen King stories are often troubled by that. In the case of Doctor Sleep, it does keep you interested in it's characters, both good and evil and how everything adds up (it helps as certain characters don't come across each other for a while). On it's own, it's entertaining and should please Stephen King fans. As a sequel to the Kubrick made The Shining, it still works even if the result is a tad awkward.What made The Shining so scary was it's ability to shows characters layers peeled away to reveal who they really were. There wasn't really a plot but more of a situation to get to know these characters. Doctor Sleep now has a plot, but a good one nonetheless. The movie does make attempts at recreating styles and shots from the Kubrick movie and director Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Gerald's Game) does a great job. It's just that some of the more Stephen King-like aspects such as the True Not, disappearing people and even Rose the Hat seem to be in different movies that don't fit The Shining of 1980.I can't say that Doctor Sleep is a scary movie, but I don't think that was the goal. I think it was always meant to be more of a supernatural thriller. It may throw off those that were expecting a follow up to the Kubrick movie, but Stephen King fans will love it. I myself think that had the movie stood on it's own, away from the 1980 movie, then this would have been amazing. As is, it's still entertaining and I do recommend it, even if you've never read or seen The Shining.I'll give this seven ""Redrum"" signs out of ten. While there are things that could have been structured and didn't need to make the connections, it makes up with great acting, a fun atmosphere and a story that seems like how you'd want to see an adult Danny Torrance. Return to the hotel and kill for it!",Doctor Sleep
108,petra_ste,As good as a Shining sequel could be,7,17 February 2020,"I love The Shining. It's one of my favorite films of all time, my favorite Stanley Kubrick movie adapting my favorite Stephen King book. Kudos to director Mike Flanagan: Doctor Sleep, while nowhere as great as Kubrick's visionary masterpiece, is a neat effort. The fact that this sequel stands next to one of cinema's greatest horror films without embarrassing itself is a testament to Flanagan's talent.Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), still scarred by his traumatic childhood experience at the Overlook Hotel, is now a recovering alcoholic and befriends young Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who, like Danny, has psychic powers. Danny and Abra face the True Knot, a band of vampire-like creatures led by Rose (Rebecca Ferguson), who track down and kill people who ""shine"" to feed on their powers.McGregor and Ferguson are great, aptly supported by a solid cast featuring newcomer Curran, Cliff Curtis and Bruce Greenwood. The actors playing the original protagonists of The Shining in flashbacks and visions all do a terrific job. Alex Essoe is uncannily on-target as she channels Shelley Duvall's Wendy. Carl Lumbly conveys Scatman Crothers' wisdom and pathos as Hallorann. And the brief scene with Dan confronting his father Jack (Henry Thomas in the Jack Nicholson role) is the best in the movie and the closest in tone to Kubrick's film. Jack Torrance here is not the flawed but redeemed man of the novel but a bitter ghost fagocitated by the Overlook Hotel. While at first he doesn't seem to recognize his son, he then taunts Dan by offering him a drink and talking about how his family ruined his life. It's a chilling scene, all the more effective because how coldly and casually Jack drops his hateful remarks, and may be the best acting ever done by McGregor, who is fantastic.Why does Doctor Sleep, while competent, not live up to the original? Short answer, Kubrick was a genius and Flanagan is not. Long answer... well, first of all the premise, while functional, is not as strong. There is nothing inherently silly about a man and his family trapped in a haunted hotel for the whole winter. On the other hand, a bunch of serial killer hippie vampires, some of whom with different powers, hunting down psychic teens and having mental duels with them... it's just goofier. Some things, no matter how intriguing on paper, come across as kooky on-screen. Consider how Kubrick cut the topiary animals from The Shining; while they were possibly the scariest part of the novel, on-screen they would have looked just silly.In fact, the movie does a clever job at adapting the Doctor Sleep novel (which is quite good, actually one of King's best recent books), condensing secondary characters and trimming subplots like one about measles and another concerning a family surprise. The movie ending, set in the Overlook, is also far more effective - in the novel it played very differently, as the hotel had been blown to smithereens at the end of The Shining book.Visually, Doctor Sleep has a certain flat look; the Overlook scenes, in particular, do a commendable job at replicating the sets but are just not as rich and eery as in The Shining. Kubrick's rendition of the Overlook, with the use of wide lenses and nightmarish sound design and soundtrack, felt like some kind of awakening eldritch abomination ready to swallow the people roaming through its maze-like corridors.Significantly, the conclusion to Kubrick's The Shining was creepy and existentially disquieting. Here it's safer and cozier; just like in King's books, the malevolent hotel is destroyed for good and evil is properly contained.Still, this is a competent effort, better than it had any right to be, although I really can't see it having the same staying power as The Shining. If Kubrick's masterpiece was the cinematic equivalent of an unforgettable honeymoon, this is a pleasant wedding anniversary.7/10",Doctor Sleep
109,eminkl,"""The Shining"" was a much better-made film.",6,7 November 2019,"A sequel to ""The Shining,"" ""Doctor Sleep"" incorporates elements of the movie ""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick - while author Stephen King dislikes it - in telling the story of the main character of that film. Danny was a kid who was able to ""shine,"" see the past, and telepathically communicate. Danny is now Dan, an adult who inherited both addiction and intentionality from his son. As the film opens, Dan (Ewan McGregor) is visited by his friend Hallorann's ghost (Scatman Crothers in ""The Shining,"" here Carl Lumbly), who suggests that just as Hallorann helped young Danny, Dan will soon be called upon to assist a brilliant young man. My favorite thing about ""Doctor Sleep"" is probably its structure, as classic as a triptych in the art world or the creation of four movements in a symphony. ""Doctor Sleep"" has three central characters with three separate story lines that, very obviously, will come together in a final set at a place of special significance to fans of ""The Shining."" There's Dan there. Abra (Kyliegh Curran) is there, whose parents are trying to curb her supernatural powers. And there's Rose (Rebecca Ferguson), who masterminds a roving group of free-loving hippie vampires traveling across the U.S. in search of torture for kids to feast on their fear and pain. Children's heavy involvement in ""Doctor Sleep"" sounds alarming and it's particularly because one of them is that sweet Jacob Tremblay from ""Space."" People who carry trauma from children's mistreatment should be warned that ""Doctor Sleep"" might be a cause. (And everyone should be warned that the film contains an incredible number of scenes of people blowing chunks.) Of the three main characters, Dan and Abra are the first to meet, and their relationship gives their heart to ""Doctor Sleep.""McGregor surrounds Dan with a deep well of suffering, and after Dan decides to go to AA meetings, it makes sense for him to reach out to support Abra when she continues to have hallucinations of tormented children. After all, he is one of the few people in the world who have witnessed what she is experiencing. Newcomer Curran is also fantastic, her Abra suggesting interesting ""Doctor Sleep"" sequels possibilities. This brings us to the one-third of ""Doctor Sleep,"" which is not working: the Rose of Rebecca Ferguson. In a performance that should be a showy, dazzling avatar of evil, Ferguson, who made a splash with a fun appearance in ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation."" Essentially, if they wanted a Cate Blanchett, an Elisabeth Moss, and, based on her performance in ""12 Years a Slave,"" an Alfre Woodard, the producers sent in a Rebecca Ferguson. The ""Shining"" references start to pile up as ""Doctor Sleep"" progresses towards its climax: the thunderous sounds of its musical score, the aerial shots of cars in the desert, that sort of thing. Such elements make ""Doctor Sleep"" unnerving, if never terrifying, but writer / director Mike Flanagan is mistaken when he re-creates classic shots from ""The Shining"" and asks Henry Thomas (yup, ""E.T.'s"" friend) to make the inimitable Jack Nicholson's eyebrow-heavy impression. It was always going to be a balancing act, figuring out how much ""The Shining"" to repurpose in this sequel of sins-of - the-father, but the more ""Doctor Sleep"" could actually replicate its predecessor, the more it reminds us that ""The Shining"" was a much better-made film.",Doctor Sleep
110,Anurag-Shetty,Slow-burn horror.,8,14 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name & is a sequel to The Shining(1980). Many years after the events of The Shining(1980), Dan Torrance(Ewan McGregor) is still traumatized, because of everything that happened at The Overlook Hotel. Now, he has to protect a girl named Abra Stone(Kyliegh Curran), who has the same abilities as him, from a cult called The True Knot, that goes after children with abilities, to stay immortal.Doctor Sleep is an excellent movie. Director Mike Flanagan has given us a worthy sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 cult classic. While The Shining(1980) focuses more on the horror elements, this film focuses more on character development. There are no jump scares as such but, the creepy vibe has been maintained throughout. There is a growing feeling of dread, some truly unnerving scenes & an unforgettable climax. The cinematography by Michael Fimognari is perfect. One flaw is that, some people might find this movie a tad bit dragging, at times. The performances are the highlight of the film. Ewan McGregor is spectacular as Dan Torrance. McGregor portrays a vast array of emotions, both subtle & not so subtle, effortlessly. Rebecca Ferguson is mind-blowing as Rose The Hat. Kyliegh Curran is outstanding as Abra Stone. Cliff Curtis is superb as Billy Freeman. Zahn McClarnon, Emily Alyn Lind & Robert Longstreet are brilliant as Crow Daddy, Snakebite Andi & Barry the Chunk, respectively. Zackary Momoh & Jocelin Donahue are good as David Stone & Lucy Stone, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Doctor Sleep is a must watch for The Shining(1980) fans.",Doctor Sleep
111,bankofmarquis,Better Than Expected,7,5 October 2020,"Over the years, there has been ""cash grab"" sequels thrown out onto an unsuspecting public years after the beloved original film has settled into the warm memories of time. Films like THE TWO JAKES (sequel to CHINATOWN), THE EVENING STAR (sequel to TERMS OF ENDEARMENT) and, most notably, THE GODFATHER III (sequel to the first two, terrific GODFATHER films) all were filmed more than 10 years after the original classic and quickly died at the box office.Thus, I steered very clear of the sequel to the great Stanley Kubrick film THE SHINING (based on the novel by Stephen King). This time it was Ewan MacGregor as a grown up Danny Torrance, otherwise known as DOCTOR SLEEP. True, this one was based on Stephen King's sequel novel, but still, I avoided it.Well...2020 being 2020...I was searching for something ""new"" to watch and tripped across this, so thought ""what the heck, I'll give it a go""...And...I was pleasantly surprised - Doctor Sleep is actually a pretty good flick, capturing the flavor of the original while becoming an entity of it's own.Doctor Sleep tells the tale of an adult Danny Torrance (Ewan MacGregor) the grown-up son of the Jack Nicholson character (Jack Torrance) in THE SHINING. Danny struggles to come to grips with what happened at the Overlook Hotel - and with his ability to ""Shine"".As written and directed by Mike Flanagan (GERALD'S GAME), Doctor Sleep serves as a creepy ""chase flick"" and a homage to The Shining at the same time. Flanagan does a decent job of giving us motivations and meanings to Danny's own personal journey while weaving in a plausible, effective use of the characters and locations of The Shining.Part of this success rests on the castings of actors to recreate the roles - and feelings - of characters from the original Stanley Kubrick film. Alex Essoe (Wendy Torrance), Carl Lumbly (Dick Halloran) and Henry Thomas - yes the kid from ET - (as ""the bartender"", who is clearly Jack Torrance) all bring the essence of the previous film's characters to the events while carving out their own versions of the characters. The same can be said for Flanagan's use (re-use?) of the Overlook Hotel locations and stylings. From the patterned carpet to the typewriter in the lobby to the elevators spewing blood to the hole in the bathroom door that the axe went through - all added to the creepy eeriness of ""I've been here before"".But, I think Flanagan was more interested in that part of the story/film than the other part, for faring less successfully is Danny's journey. Fault cannot be made of Ewan MacGregor's performance, he is very good, considering the clunky dialogue he is given, and he gives Danny a haunted feeling, simultaneously chasing and running from his past. But Flanagan really skims over this part of the film - why/how Danny becomes the titular ""Doctor Sleep"" is almost in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment. While I like the pacing of this film, I think it could have used a little more care and feeding on the front end, to help us understand/invest in Danny's journey more.Also not faring as well as it could have is the bad guys in this film - a group of characters called THE KNOT. Flanagan enlists a ""decent enough"" group of character actors for this group though, I think, this film pulls it's punches with these villains and it suffers from it. The leader of the group is ""Rose The Hat"", played by Rebecca Ferguson (THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN) and she is charismatic (as always) and draws you into her world, and her group. She is very seductive in this role - and that is really good. HOWEVER, when it is time for this ""spider"" to pounce on her prey, she just doesn't have the intimidation and fear factor, so I was never really scared or unnerved by her.But, as far as sequels go, this one holds up very well and does a very good job of being an homage to the original film while driving it's own story - and characters - along.Letter Grade: B+7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Doctor Sleep
112,fernandoschiavi,"With a narrative progression that does not give in to the false need to speed up the plot, Doctor Sleep has a story and make good references to the classic of Kubrick",8,2 November 2021,"Mike Flanagan (""Dangerous Game""), director and screenwriter, had the thankless mission of dealing with the ambiguity the film asked for. With a narrative progression that does not give in to the false need to speed up the most mundane stages of the plot, Doctor Sleep immerses the viewer by detailing, for almost 1 hour of his footage, the personal evolution of Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), now an alcoholic in seeking recovery and suppressing their telepathic gifts, referred to as ""enlightenment."" From the beginning, Flanagan's film deals with themes of alcoholism and trauma through the visual materialization of metaphors, like the boxes Danny creates in his mind to lock up literal ghosts from his past.Flanagan's montage, attentive to the individual planes of objects and economical in angles, incorporates these plot details as if we were going into the psychological of the characters. And it is ironic to think that, narratively, it is in the most direct connection with its predecessor that the main problem of this adaptation lies. While the tributes are visually beautiful, the final act is unnecessarily long, and could have been resolved more nimbly. Certainly, 20 minutes less would not be missed here, would leave the work with a more pleasant pace and could bring an ending for Dan closer to the book, bridging his character deviation in the first minutes and showing his redemption.Unfortunately for some the film becomes a little slow, but the construction of narrative, thriller and details is necessary, and believe me, no scene should be discarded. So much so, that scenes like the ""baseball boy"" (Jacob Tremblay) filled with horror and savagery is the opposite extreme of the hospital scenes for the terminally ill, which, sad as they are, make us reflect. Doctor Sleep's greatest asset is knowing how to unite in visual, concept, ambiance and soundtrack the references of O Illuminado. There is always a detail or a whole part of the prequel in this film, even more with the improvement of the narrative and loose ends or ""sort of no why"" scenes in Kubrick's film that are here tied and/or corrected.The production, however, gives up claustrophobia and takes a trip through the American countryside, a peculiar mark of Stephen King, to show that not only Danny, but the world is enlightened. The gift he believed to be restricted exists out there in other people and in different intensities; in the same way, just as he is one of the good guys, and even wants to distance himself from such powers, which only brought him disgrace, there are also those who use this force in different ways. For this very reason the story separates itself, in order to show the varied ways in which the Enlightened Ones deal with their own powers.Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) is a girl who, little by little, begins to take charge of her own gift and uses it to communicate, as well as receiving messages that make her nights not very peaceful. There is a connection between these people, after all, and being one of the most powerful, it ends up serving as a vector. The third pillar of this story joins her in the form of Rose (Rebecca Ferguson), leader of a group of outcasts who use this power in another way. The connection with the occult takes place in the form of maintaining one's power, with the consumption of what can be explained as the vital energy of the other Enlightened Ones, responsible for making not only her, but also her band, eternal and always beautiful. , active and alive.Thus, a plot is created that will shake the structures of all of them to a greater or lesser degree. Danny, as he leaves his past behind and builds his own life, discovers that he has yet to return to the darkest places in his own soul. Abra will see her comfortable world turning upside down in the worst possible way, while the same goes for Rose, only in the opposite direction. Of powerful shrew, she will realize that there are, yes, axes sharper than hers.After the introduction, it is also important to tell the initiates that Doctor Sleep is another film. Although we have all the spirit of the previous story, here we are going to leave a suffocating story for a plot that will mix thriller, horror, action and a good dose of paranormal powers. Doctor Sleep invests more than half of his 2h30 projection in the formation of this universe, showing each of these three elements in depth before putting them on a collision course. When it should be a horror movie, Doctor Sleep turns into a game of cat and mouse powered by the forces of the occult. As said, we are facing a universe built with caution, in order to be fixed in the viewers' minds and, logically, make sense, despite some slips like the bizarre break in the character Andi (Emily Alyn Lind), who introduced an interesting figure. In the initial moments, it ends up completely perverted without reason, completely losing its purpose.The biggest problem, however, are the moments when Doctor Sleep remembers that it needs to be, above all, a sequel to The Shining. The first few minutes, with a quick tour of the Overlook's celebrated and sinister corridors, as well as a brief look at the state of the Torrance family after those events, serve as a good continuity. They are interesting anecdotes about what came next and a reunion with old acquaintances, even if played by new actors. However, as more than an hour later demonstrates, Doctor Sleep is his own story.Flanagan's stylistic gifts, along with a sometimes minimalist and sometimes spare Newton Brothers soundtrack, are capable of sustaining Doctor Sleep not so much as a horror film, but a supernatural thriller full of discomfort. At certain moments, the virtuosity of his images challenges the fine lines between strangeness and pure tackiness, always fascinating. Amidst this, there are very few scares, and macabre images are less recurrent than expected, but a lugubrious feeling runs through much of the duration - the greenish palette chosen by director of photography Michael Fimognari gives an aspect of rottenness and disease to the images. The presence of death is evoked at almost every moment, whether to repel or move.This atmosphere is broken by the later decision to recreate iconic moments and images from the original film, in a reverence that even affects the direction of the narrative. Putting itself at odds with Kubrick's classic, it's not hard to imagine that Flanagan pales in comparison, limiting the impact of an outcome that can be controversial with both film and book fans. Returning to the Overlook Hotel is a nice feeling to see how everything turned out after years and remember some of the characters that have already appeared there and have already guaranteed us iconic cinema scenes. Although the reconstruction is very good, it is clear that most of them used digital resources. And it's at the Hotel Overlook that we'll have the most amazing scenes from the movie.In the narrative, if Kubrick ""had no sense of the emotional investment"" the original work placed on the family - in Stephen King's own words - Flanagan couldn't be the most perfect man for the job. The great strength of The Curse of the Hill Residence - a series that launched the director, screenwriter and producer in the eyes of the general public - is not the efficient suspense and scary setting, but the family drama. If in The Shining the villain was isolation and the figure of a Jack Nicholson maddened by his own demons and the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel, in Doctor Sleep the villain is alcoholism... And hungry ghosts of the past... And a group that vaporizes children's souls.Doctor Sleep's great virtue is his wisdom in the use of references. Yes, the disquieting musical theme of O Illuminado is present, and some scenes reproduce excerpts from that feature frame by frame. But all of this has a narrative function, it's not just there in the name of nostalgia. A clear example is when Dr. John Dalton (Bruce Greenwood) talks to Danny about a job opening at the local nursing home. The scenography of the doctor's office copies in minute detail (from the color of the wall to the paintings and objects on the desk) the office of the Overlook manager, who interviews Jack for the position of janitor in the first film. By mirroring the two moments, the intention is to contrast the son's fragility (which he recognizes as his last chance) with the father's arrogance (who ignores the warnings of the future boss). As a bonus, the resource also helps to reconcile the narratives - after all, the Jack in the book, more human and multidimensional, has a posture close to his son during the interview. The new feature still seeks to redeem the protagonist of The Shining by recovering the weight of drinking problems in his arc, during Danny's touching speech at the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.Doctor Sleep is everything The Shining has left open all these years, but forget what you saw and especially what you expect to see. Stephen King wisely used his own creation to expand the mythology around lighting without getting caught up in its origins, and the film manages to adapt this very well by creating a story whose focus is more human, albeit a continuation of a work known for focusing on the supernatural and in psychological terror. If cinema is currently saturated with remakes, reboots, revivals, among others, Doctor Sleep proves that Hollywood still knows how to surprise when it wants to and using very little, and that's what the film becomes: only with its great script, direction and acting performances. Lives up to the legacy left by Kubrick and even as an adaptation of Stephen King's work.",Doctor Sleep
113,joebloggscity,Doctor Sleep? You'll keep awake for it.,7,7 November 2020,"This film was stepping into a no mans land. The original is universally acknowledged as not only one of the greatest seminal movie masterpieces ever, not only in horror, but also as a perfectly contained movie. Going by others in the genre who have attempted sequel/cash-in many years, it could only fail. Anyone else who watched the abysmal sequel to The Wicker Man for example could attest to that.Yet this one doesn't fail at all. Granted it's not on the same plinth as it's illustrious predecessor, this film instead opts to concentrate on story alone and leave attempting to be a directional masterpiece. The story follows on ultimately a generation from the original, and really the film can be best taken as a story in the 'Shining' universe, and should be seen separate to the original.
If anything, this film is a respectful homage to the original one, heavily referencing the original in the opening to get that over with, but then allowing our now grown-up lead (Danny played by Ewan McGregor) to show how he is coping with the PTSD order.I won't bother repeating the story, but it is a different movie to the first. I still enjoyed it. I liked that it was in awe of the first, and is paying tribute without doing a copycat of the first movie.Ewan McGregor is excellent as the lead, as he most often is, and ably assisted by the rest. If anything, without Ewan McGregor this would have been a straight to cable TV type movie.This is NOT much of a scary movie. Few if any jump moments, but don't let that put you off. It's a nostalgia run for the Shining fans, and the more open-minded fans will enjoy this romp.I do hope this has closed the book on anymore films in this 'universe' but that's being naive.

The confidence and upper hand the 'good guys' had through out.Kyliegh Curran's performance was right in the zone, believable and strong.
I liked how Abra was keen to bring it on, not a cowering scared girl about her powers but proactive and bold. It turned what could have been a dark and depressing character arc into an interesting and relatable one. The one thing I was hoping for was she would take the piss out of rose's hat.

Ewan McGregor did a great non star turn as a burnt out alcoholic on the edge. Great homeless vibe. Kept it low key etc. Again I liked that he was in control of the demons keeping them boxed etc. The movie could have wasted lots of time on his battle with them, but that would have been depressing and predictable territory so it was great they moved along and dealt with other aspects of his journey.Rose the Hat. I didn't really like her character and didn't buy her or get a feeling for her backstory.

120,kuarinofu,I knew Mike Flanagan would not disappoint,8,8 December 2019,"I love both Stephen King and Mike Flanagan.King has written great stories (with all his tropes), he has lots of so-bad-it's-good adaptations (mostly mini-series) and some really good full feature adaptations I love (with my favorites being 1408, The Mist and Gerald's Game).Flanagan has done some quality work on his own: Oculus, Before I Wake and the aforementioned Gerald's Game).So when I heard that Flanagan is doing another King's story I knew he wouldn't let us down.Doctor Sleep is mostly good. It really feels like they had to drop big chunks of story and character development to fit everything in one full feature.I had no problem with the direction besides that some important emotional moments are sort of watered down and you don't feel the gravity of those. Some of them also don't work because we barely have time for the supporting characters.Story-wise it's faulty of over-explaining a lot, but I think this was done so people who didn't see Kubrick's classic would still enjoy this one. It was very straightforward and the mystery element was never really there. But the direction saved it from becoming a bore.Character-wise this would've worked much better if it was split into two parts, since they clearly had not enough run-time for all the characters, but it was mostly enough.The acting was good but nothing special, Ferguson was a pleasure to watch though. I was also surprised to see the kid from Before I Wake, seems like Flanagan is used to working with him and he does some good scary acting in a scene that gives you shivers.Overall, for me it felt like Doctor Sleep complements and reinforces the Shining, which was the original story's intent and so, I think I can call this movie a success. It feels like the best thing they could've done with all the limitations they were put into.",Doctor Sleep
121,springfieldrental,Interesting Follow-up of The Shining,8,14 November 2019,"When Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining was released, Stephen King hated it, so much so that he wrote a sequel to his novel, which Doctor Sleep became. In the movie that is based on King's later book, scriptwriter/director/editor Mike Flanagan does a fine job in translating King's work as well as paying homage to the Kubrick film.
In Gary Olsen's riveting and informative book on Kubrick as well as other film directors in his ""The 15 Geniuses Behind The Lens: How The Top Film Directors Shaped The Movies We See Today,"" he describes how much a perfectionist Kubrick was in directing The Shining. The movie was not an easy one to produce for the director, actors and crew members. But Stanley came out with one of the most interesting thrillers in the history of film.
Making a sequel to this iconic film would be tough, but Flanagan does achieve wonders by touching upon The Shining, yet coming out with his (and King's) version of what happened 40 years later. Enjoyable if you're into horror films.",Doctor Sleep
122,Movie-Misfit,Fantastic Film. Fantastic Sequel!!,8,1 November 2019,"Almost 40 years later, fans of the original horror classic The Shining finally get to see just what came after the madness...And for me - it was well worth the wait!While the first half may seemed dragged out and a slow burner, I - as a film maker - can understand why. For today's audience, many of whom have not seen The Shining or will want to if they are like my husband and kids (who don't really want to look at anything pre-2000ad), Doctor Sleep will have to hold its own as a standalone movie.And in knowing this when you watch the film, then it becomes a bit more understandable as to why things are taking their time. Saying that, there are still many moments of interest and surprise in that first half that carry the story to a faster paced, scare filled second!Replacing the actors from the first film (obviously), Doctor Sleep recreates a number of The Shining scenes (including a vital one, although keeping Shelly Duval in it strangely enough) and does it well. We eventually make our way back to the infamous location also, which was brilliant.The twist - there right from the start - is classic King and a welcome change of pace compared to the slow burning original. Performances from all involved are just fantastic and there was more than enough scares and jumps to have our cinema audience scream out loud!Doctor Sleep is well worth a second watch which will no doubt reveal so much more we may have missed in the initial viewing. I really enjoyed it, a lot, although I wish they had started with a remake of The Shining followed by this - much like they did with IT...But hey, I'm not complaining!",Doctor Sleep
123,tm-sheehan,Not a Classic but still Shiny,8,14 November 2019,"My Review Doctor Sleep- my rating 8/10Well before I begin ""Oh What a Horrifull Day I had today!First I can't talk about Dr Sleep before I confess I had never seen The Shining until today this 1980 Stanley Kubrick Classic horror movie starring the great Jack Nicholson had escaped my attention.
I was so impressed with The Shining and agree it's an ageless classic .
Doctor Sleep Directed Edited and wrote The screenplay for Doctor Sleep an adaptation of Stephen King's novel which I haven't read yet.Doctor Sleep in my opinion is a very very good horror movie not the classic that The Shining is for sure but it doesn't try to be.
If I hadn't seen The Shining today I would have missed the many homages that Dr Sleep gives us Movie goers , especially in the last 40 or so minutes.I read an article in the today interviewing Stephen King on the theme of Alcoholism in Doctor Sleep He said when asked by the interviewer . ""what happened to Danny Torrance, the boy from The Shining, he always found himself wondering. Specifically: what the story would have looked like if Danny's father - mad ""white-knuckle alcoholic"" Jack Torrance - had ""found AA. And I thought, well, let's find out.""
King has been sober for decades, ever since his family staged an intervention in the late 1980s. If he hesitated to write in this much depth about AA, it was only because he wanted to get it right. ""
He goes on ""Take Dan Torrance, who is the child of an alcoholic, child of a dysfunctional family, abusive father, and he says, as people do, 'I'm never going to be like my father; I'm never going to be like my mother.' And then you grow up and find yourself with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and maybe you're walking the kiddies around. And I wanted to see what would happen with that.""Well the opening scenes in Doctor Sleep Show answers the question on just what happens when Dan is at his lowest rock bottom waking up from a blackout with a naked woman he doesn't know a distressed baby an empty wallet and injuries from a bashing this makes him desperate enough to then to go to AA to seek recovery and our story begins to progress,no spoilers from me.Ewan Mc Gregor is excellent as Dan the vulnerable psychic and sensitive Dr Sleep ,a nickname for his comforting bedside manner the dying usually with a cat very much like our Ragdoll Bella on the deathbed ,I'll be nervous of Bella hoping on our bed for a while.I found the 2 female stars of this film more outstanding than Ewan we have 13 year old Kyleigh Curran as Abra Stone, she literally SHINES in this film and I hope gets a Best Supporting actress nomination also Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat I thought was almost as scary and frightening as Jack Nicholson in Shine.The difference I felt in Shine and Doctor Sleep was the music score in Shine was perfect the Bella Bartok Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta was perfect but the only music in Doctor Sleep I noticed was the repeat of music in the opening of Shine with the mountain drive back to the derelict ""Overlook Hotel.""
The other big difference to me was that Shine really only had 4 main characters this movie had a full ensemble cast and got a bit busy and muddy in plot at times.I found the Baseball boy scene horrible and it disturbed me greatly as mentioned I was the only person in the cinema so couldn't gauge audience reaction.
I flashed immediately to a very published child abduction in N.S.W. still unsolved and it did upset me but the horrible scene did set up the dreadful cult behaviour.
Summing up Doctor Sleep is a little like Twilight meets the Excorcist meets the
Shining and although Horror is not my favourite genre I'm starting to Shine a light on it's valuable contribution to Cinema as long as it's well done Dr Sleep and The Shining and IT are very good Winchester, Hereditary and The Happening are not.I missed the cameo role of Shine star Danny Lloyd who appears in the crowd during a baseball game in one of Doctor Sleep's scenes. Lloyd's cameo marks 41 years since he first appeared as the young Danny, though he hasn't pursued an acting career and works as a teacher in real life.",Doctor Sleep
124,DarthVoorhees,When it peaks out of Kubrick's shadow 'Doctor Sleep' is fantastic,8,30 September 2021,"Mike Flanagan has the unenviable task of making a sequel to 'The Shining'. He has both Kubrick and King on his shoulders and their interpretations of the material were often at odds with one another. The ultimate marriage is a little awkward. I was a little underwhelmed by the film when I saw it in theaters but it has been getting a lot of love since and so I gave it another chance. It's a movie that marinates with you and needs time. The things I liked least about it were when it tried to be ""horrific"" and Kubrickian. 'Doctor Sleep' successes lie with its character work and the brilliant performances from it's leads.It's a movie with outstanding individual moments. 'Doctor Sleep' is adapted from the King novel that has a great central idea that should have focused on both in print and on screen. The plot line of Dan Torrance becoming a depressed alcoholic like his father to mute ""the shining"" is inspired and it is perfect material for Ewan McGregor who gives it the perfect amount of sadness and pathos. He gives one of the best performances of his storied career here. There are some deviations from the book and one of the best is when Dan literally confronts the ghost of his father in the Overlook, a manifestation of the characters guilt and trauma. Rebecca Ferguson creates one of the most memorable horror antagonists in recent years with Rose the Hat. She is mysterious and totally in control. She brings a palpable edge when she is on screen, we know the character is always capable of terrible things.The problem with the rest of the movie that really keeps me from being as enthusiastic as some tend to be is no matter how hard you try emulating Kubrick never really works out for anyone. 'The Shining' is a perfect horror film and while 'Doctor Sleep' does an admirable job trying to pay tribute and exist in that world I just got bored with the second hand scares. It comes off as a tribute band playing greatest hits. We get all the classic ghosts and iconography but they are just doing what they did before. We have to believe that the Overlook which has a conduit to what scares us is the same as before. I read a review that said it makes the scary Overlook look like a one trick pony and it is kind of an accurate assessment.When 'Doctor Sleep' examines the subtext behind the ghouls I love it. I totally dig the scenes where Ewan McGregor's Dan discusses death with his hospice patients or when he is at the AA meetings. The Kubrick stuff? I'd much rather watch the original.",Doctor Sleep
125,Neptune165,Overrated to be honest,1,27 January 2020,"This movie clearly had a lot of thought put into it.If you like this movie you've obviously missed ""the shining"" this is a worst sequel and has nothing near the quality of ""the shining"" This Dr Sleep movie literally put me to sleep. Am i the only one who really hated this movie? The acting was so bad and it wasnt scary at all. All that it had was some good looking CGi and cheap jumpscares without a decent build up. This movie was such a waste of time, The movie make you feel like limited movie time is not enough to contain novel's feeling, atmosphere and vivid explanation. for example that causes absent of Abra's lost feeling of her father's death and many other scenes lacking of not-enough emotion . fast-passing scenes without common emotional level. This movie was horrible, i hated it. It was so messy, everything was all over the place, this is embarrassing Don't see whats so good about it way over hyped. I also felt some scenes could have been way better. I mean, the death of the main villain, how disappointing was that? It took about 7 seconds. They could have made it so much better. And for building up to the confrontation (= the whole movie), the fight leading up to the defeat was also very short and underwhelming. You get the hints about ""she is very powerful"", you don't wanna see her when she is angry"" etc... and than you get that ending scene.. It felt rushed.",Doctor Sleep
126,brankovranjkovic,Doctor Sleep - Sequel to 'The Shinning',8,7 November 2019,"Tense thriller horror based on a Stephen King novel.Takes place many years after the original. Three plot threads, Danny, the cult, and Abra all interweave and come together nicely at the end.Danny is now a traumatised alcoholic adult, he goes travelling and finds a small town to 'find himself', gets a job in a hospital and discovers he has a skill for comforting dying patients.The cult were supernatural beings a little like vampires, they killed their victims by sucking the 'steam' from their bodies, this is their food, similar to blood to a vampire.Abra has strong 'shinning' skills, is telepathic with a strong link to Danny. She witnesses the murder of a young boy by the cult.Fans of the first movie will easily see all the references to the original. I'm not a big fan or horror, but this could be described as a thriller as well and I enjoyed this more than I expected.",Doctor Sleep
127,Darkside-Reviewer,Time to take your medicine Doc,10,18 December 2019,I didn't have high expectations for this sequel to the 1980 original masterpiece made by Kubrick especially considering how it's been 39 years and the movie is considered a classic and seeing how sequels and remakes never do the original justice and fail all round but Doctor Sleep is a true sequel that follows kings book pretty well and the original movie very well while adding a new ideas of it's own many people have criticised the movie for not being very interesting storywise or not being faithful enough to the source material or that it isn't as violent as the original and so it's not how Kubrick would of done it but in my personal opinion Doctor Sleep is very good sequel that follows the events after what happened to Danny Torrance at the overlook hotel and how it affected his life how he grew up with his special gift and how it evolves and developed as he got older we know there are others like him out there but are they good bad do they experience things the same way he does the world is expanded upon more the boundaries pushed the shine is brighter but to have this unique gift puts you in danger from those who hunger for more than they get.The acting is superb from everyone involved there are many returning characters from the original played by different actors which is to be expected after almost 40 years I highly recommend watching this movie if you enjoy the original book and movie for what it truly is a unique story that plays with your mind making think and fear more than what can be seen by the naked eye a slow madness that builds over time from the torture of the dead who love nothing more than to haunt our characters before Danny Torrance was alone and afraid now he's older still afraid still tortured by his past never really moving on but like his old friend Dick Hollorann he helps others like him and discovers he's not alone.If your expecting anything violent then you will be disappointed but if your a fan of great storytelling a slow build up and deep character development then this is the Shining sequel you have been waiting for all these years.,Doctor Sleep
128,anselmdaniel,A slow thriller and worthy sequel,9,4 April 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Doctor Sleep is a horror movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is the sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 movie The Shining. The movie is directed by Mike Flanagan, and is based on the novel Doctor Sleep by Stephen King. The movie stars Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson, Kyliegh Curran, and Cliff Curtis. Danny Torence survives his encounter at the Overlook hotel but is still haunted by his experiences. He delves into alcoholism to stifle his shining abilities. As Danny attempts to recover he discovers another with his ability.Doctor Sleep is an excellent sequel to the 1980 movie The Shining. The movie is excellent overall and is a slow thriller with little to no jump scares. This movie is much more of a drama and character study that Danny Torence, played by Ewan McGregor, needing to deal with his alcoholism. The movie has Danny communicating with Abra played by Kyliegh Curran which enhances this dynamic further. The two are forced to make contact and help one another when The True Knot threatens their existence as individuals with the Shine. The story itself is incredibly enthralling and the movie takes its time to build up Danny Torence as a distinct character from how the audience saw him in The Shining.Doctor Sleep has a great antagonist in Rose the Hat played by Rebecca Ferguson. The antagonist does not seem contrived as the villains came from the same power as Abra and Danny Torence. The antagonists were played to great effect in discussing addiction when Danny Torence was concerned. The antagonists hurt many innocent members that were represented by children. All of the scenes with Rose the Hat were enrapturing to watch as she and the cult of The True Knot were explored. These scenes added a lot to the immersion into the world that Stephen King created and it reflected well on the screen.The casting and acting are perfect. I remember Ewan McGregor from his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequels. In this movie he portrays the initially weak Danny Torence incredibly well. As the movie heads to a climax, Danny Torence needs to confront his addictions and deep seated fears of the hotel. Ewan McGregor does a convincing job of portraying Danny Torence fighting these temptations and underlying fears. The main villainess in Rose the Hat does an intimidating job orchestrating all of the plots that The True Knot creates in order to secure a longer life. These events are played well by the supporting cast.I highly recommend 'Doctor Sleep'. This is a movie that has great themes and magnificent acting by the cast. The movie is less about horror and more of a personal introspection personified by Danny Torence.Grade: A",Doctor Sleep
129,virek213,"Reviisting THE SHINING And The Overlook Hotel, Four Decades Later",9,12 November 2019,"With the dearth of really good horror films in the 21st century, it is instructive to look back at the 1980 Stanley Kubrick-directed masterpiece THE SHINING, based on the 1977 novel (the third one) by Stephen King. But much of the initial controversy over it was in how much Kubrick's film diverged from the novel; indeed, King went out of his way to all but disown the film that Kubrick made, only to see it be hugely remembered in the long run while the 1997 ABC-TV miniseries of the same name that he personally adapted and sanctioned has for all intents and purposes been forgotten. To settle the matter, however, in 2013, he published ""Doctor Sleep"", which was more or less a sequel to both his novel and Kubrick's film. And then in 2019, writer/director Mike Flanagan took up the torch and made out of King's sequel novel what will, with time, be regarded as one of the better horror films of the 21st century.Ewam MacGregor stars as the adult Dan Torrance, almost four decades removed from the horrible events he and his mother experienced at the Overlook Hotel that resulted in his father going insane and eventually killing himself. After struggling for years with the same alcoholism and violent behavior that doomed his father's chances for succeeding, he finally finds meaning with his incredible but scary gift for ""shining"". Through an African-American teenager (Kyliegh Curran), he learns of a psychopathic cult known as The True Knot, whose members live off the ""steam"" of those like MacGregor and Curran who ""shine"". Indeed, several kids with that power have been abducted, and then either killed or possessed, by this cult and its deranged, witchy leader (Rebecca Ferguson). With a good friend (Cliff Curtis) from the New Hampshire hospice facility he works at, where his comforting of dying patients has earned him the name ""Doctor Sleep"", he and Curran track down the cult and manage to wipe out most of the cult in an isolated New Hampshire state park. But Ferguson somehow manages to get away, and thus remains a menace. In the end, MacGregor makes the only decision he possibly can to end the torment that he and Curran feel; and that is to confront Ferguson by returning to the scene of his former childhood trauma, the Overlook Hotel. And it is also at that now-condemned Overlook that he and Curran confront not only Ferguson, but also the demons and ghosts that still continue to haunt him.Flanagan, who was responsible for two exceptional horror films of this era, 2013's OCULUS and 2016's BEFORE I WAKE, very cagily crosses both of King's interrelated novels and the many merits of Kubrick's movie into a very sinister and suspenseful mix of the supernatural and psychological. MacGregor impresses in the role of Dan Torrance, essayed in Kubrick's film by Danny Lloyd (who has a cameo role in DOCTOR SLEEP), and Curran is equally fine in her role. Ferguson is about as scary a villain, or villainess in her case, as there has been in any horror film. Although the use of post-1980s horror film shock cliché shots by Flanagan is sometimes a bit irritating, the shocks and suspense that were part-and-parcel of Kubrick's film otherwise still remain. There are, inevitably, some fairly hair-raising moments of blood and gore, and some slightly graphic sex, but this is hardly the kind of SAW/HOSTEL-type ""torture porn"" that King himself has rightly condemned in the horror genre, and is in fact much closer in tone to not only THE SHINING, but also similar films like POLTERGEIST and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY.Equally significant to the impact of DOCTOR SLEEP are the brief uses of the ""Dies Irae"" theme that introduced Kubrick's original film, as well as the 1920s period music heard in the Gold Room sequences back in 1980. In the end, even if DOCTOR SLEEP is not quite on the level of its incredibly illustrious and disturbing predecessor, it is nevertheless about as worthy a horror film as Hollywood has had in decades; and like THE SHINING, it too is likely to achieve masterpiece status when all is said and done.",Doctor Sleep
130,strike-1995,One lime,8,17 November 2019,An affective thriller that pays homage to the original whilst Flanagan maintains his artistic style.,Doctor Sleep
131,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,31 October 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)There's this misconceived idea that ""scary movies"" are the ones with demons, monsters, or ghosts literally showing up in jump scare sequences, one after another, accompanied by an extremely loud sound. Granted, we're scared of what we're scared of. No debate here. However, one common complaint about this type of horror films is that they aren't ""scary enough"". I couldn't disagree more. These movies are the ones that truly get to us and stay with us for a while. If we watch a film with cyclical jump scares, we're going to forget about it as soon as we leave the theater. Movies with a horrific story, based on relatable themes, those are the ones that leave us uncomfortable and disturbed. I'm just writing this ""prologue"" to say that you shouldn't go in expecting a ""scary"" film. At least, not in a mainstream way. Moving on...As you probably know by now (if you don't, check out my The Shining's review), I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. It's a cult classic horror movie, one that influenced generations to come, especially regarding filmmaking techniques and equipment. With that said, Mike Flanagan had one of the toughest jobs of 2019. Not only did he need to deliver a sequel worthy of being associated with a beloved classic, but he had to deal with all the differences between the source material and Kubrick's changes. I'm going to leave a SPOILER WARNING for The Shining since the film came out 40 years ago, and I already wrote a review about it. Still, SPOILER-FREE for Doctor Sleep, don't worry.In case you don't know, the major difference between King's book and Kubrick's cinematic adaptation is the ending. In the book, Jack Torrance forgets to relieve the hotel boiler's pressure, and it explodes, destroying the hotel and killing Jack in the process. In Kubrick's movie, Jack freezes to death in the maze outside the hotel while chasing his son, while the hotel stands tall. Flanagan is able to do the impossible: he perfectly continues the story left by Kubrick while respecting King's ""demands"". Just don't go with a ""purist"" mentality, thinking that Flanagan doesn't have the right to explore and expand ""the shining"". It's a sequel, so expect things to be added to the story (nothing is removed or retconned, so relax). As long as it makes sense, be always open to new ideas.As the director, Flanagan proves once again he's a pretty talented guy by seamlessly recreating some of The Shining's most iconic scenes, but also by delivering some tricks of his own. With the help of his amazing cinematographer, Michael Fimognari, they are able to generate incredible levels of tension, characteristic of the original film. As the editor, he puts together everything remarkably well. The sequences inside someone's mind are wonderfully handled and provide some of the best moments of the entire movie. However, there's a massive difference when it comes to how the runtime flows in each film.Both cross the 140-minute mark, and both purposefully employ slow pacing. Nevertheless, The Shining feels like it goes by way faster than Doctor Sleep (and mathematically it does have less 5-10 minutes, but that's not the point). Why? Due to Kubrick's movie constantly having long takes and extense dialogues, while Flanagan's installment has a modern approach with regular cuts plus much more action. Audiences presumably won't think of this (it's not like the ""average Joe"" notices or even cares if a scene has been going for 5 minutes straight or pieced together with 50 cuts), and just assume that the latter is more boring than the first without really understanding why.People will probably blindly blame the story, but Doctor Sleep has a lot more ""blockbuster entertainment"" than The Shining. The latter is pretty much two hours spent inside a hotel where dialogue is the primary source of entertainment (things only go crazy in the last 15-20 minutes), and we all know that the general public usually doesn't fall for that. The sequel has a lot more action, subplots, and characters, so the runtime should go by faster than the original, right? No. This film is the number one proof that I'm going to use from now on to defend that uncut dialogue sequences and overall long takes are the best way of managing an extended runtime without it feeling too ""heavy"", especially in a psychological horror flick.I wrote all these last paragraphs not to complain about the movie's being too slow, too long, or too dull. I'm just trying to help everyone understand why the film might feel slower and (much) longer, while protecting its story because the screenplay is indeed extremely well-written. Like in the original, exposition is handled beautifully with scarce lazy displays, but it's the characters of Ewan McGregor and the debutant Kyliegh Curran that carry the narrative effortlessly. McGregor is the perfect casting as Danny Torrance, and he does a great job of embodying Dan's personality. However, it's Danny's journey through his young and adult years that impresses me.Exceptional character development! Danny's life after the events at the Overlook Hotel is as realistic and logical as it could be. Flanagan does a phenomenal job in handling this character and throwing just the right obstacles in his path. The way he deals with the aftermath of The Shining, how he grows up as a man, and even what he ends up doing for a living, everything is absolutely perfect. Furthermore, he's not alone. Abra is a badass young girl who wants to use her ""shine"" to protect others, but this time it's the actress that steals the spotlight from the character. Kyliegh Curran delivers one of the best young acting debuts I've ever witnessed. She's wonderful as Abra, and her range of emotions is already surprisingly vast.She has some of the best scenes of the movie, especially when she's ""fighting"" Rose the Hat, but here is where we get to my major issue with the film. Rebecca Ferguson gives an outstanding performance, no doubt about it. She elevates infinite sequences, giving 200% to her role. However, her character and The True Knot group are the only significant flaw of this sequel. When writing a villain, there are basically two paths for success: either make the ""bad guy"" a compelling character with whom the audience can create some sort of empathy with and understand where he/she comes from, or turn him/her into a menacing, powerful, scary force that makes us fear for our heroes.Flanagan apparently chooses the latter route, and unfortunately, it's his only misstep. I don't know if King didn't allow for changes to Rose or The True Knot cult, but they don't quite work when adapting to the big screen. Not only their history is never truly explored, but their motivations are too shallow, so I didn't care for a single character from the group, not even Rose. If she was the ""menacing, powerful, scary force"" that I wrote above, this wouldn't be so important, but the truth is she isn't. As the narrative progresses, there's a constant reminder that our heroes are in danger and that Rose is astonishingly strong, but the interactions between her and Abra prove the contrary. So, I never really felt frightened or overwhelmed by her.A decent portion of runtime is handed to Rose's group, but its development didn't work for me at all. They're not bad villains, and they're still more fleshed out that a lot of characters in horror movies. I just think something's missing. Nevertheless, that's the only major problem I have with the movie. For true fans of The Shining, the countless references and Easter Eggs are such a delight (there's good and bad fan-service, the one present in this sequel only appears after we are already invested in the story and its characters, demonstrating once more Flanagan's talent). From the haunting and addictive score that The Newton Brothers are able to seamlessly adapt to the sequel to the influential Kubrick's framing, Flanagan and his team produce something pretty extraordinary having in mind this is a sequel to one of the most beloved horror films of all-time.In the end, Doctor Sleep might be the first sequel/remake/reboot/whatever to a cult classic movie that doesn't diminish the original, disgracefully copies it or takes something away from it, while actually being an individually great film with a captivating narrative and compelling leads, plus the right amount of homages to the classic. Mike Flanagan took the impossible task of balancing both Stephen King's The Shining and Stanley Kubrick's cinematic adaptation, and successfully nailed pretty much everything regarding the connection between the main stories. In addition to the slow pacing not working as well as in the original, The True Knot group is the big stumble in an otherwise pretty consistent screenplay. However, the phenomenal cast (with a terrific debut performance from Kyliegh Curran) elevate every scene, ultimately driving the sequel to a nostalgia-full ending that will turn out to be divisive among fans. I stand on the good side. Therefore, I genuinely appreciate this movie. If you're a fan of the original, you can't miss this one!",Doctor Sleep
132,SoumikBanerjee25,"Worked as a Sequel, was craving for more though!",7,18 May 2020,"I saw the director's cut, 3 hours long journey of Mike Flanagan's world of horror. His expertise in this particular genre is easily noticeable! The Cinematography is filled with atmospheric brilliance as well as pays homage to the classic film. Great too see him using Old style transitions methods, reenactments of few famous sequences from the first part, and keeping the overlook hotel as the prior location where it all ends. It was like a Poetic justice, the story found it conclusion where it all began in the First place.The cinematography is brilliant, maybe not on the same level as ""The Shining""; bearing in mind it debuted in 80s! Still this new addition clutches on modern day horror perks pretty well. The Tonality being kept dark, most of the times. And I liked that. There is a scene, with a Little kid; that scene I won't Spoil obviously but I assure it would literally shake you from the core!
Beware, as it's not your typical dish of horror but a more intimate and raw cuisine that left a Delicious taste nonetheless.The performances are commendable. Especially from Kyliegh Curran as Abra and Rebecca Ferguson as Rosie. Ewan McGregor might not be as fluent as Jack Nicholson was in The Shining but it's a totally different character so I don't really mind. Although The characters are well performed, I still feel they all could have been written on a better note. They lacked certain depth that I was hugely expecting for. Some characters, the side ones to be specific; not all of them have been introduced properly and their individual abilities aren't being portrayed enough in my opinion. Some rapid succession of incidents consisting those same side characters, felt hurried and honestly didn't justify the claims about them being the evil ""Monsters"". The contradictory portrayal is confusing.The storyline indeed feels stretched in some moments, and usually takes a dip whenever there aren't much action on going. Whenever any face off happens between the good and the bad. It suddenly becomes attractive and showcases the true potential it has. But Alas! That hasn't stayed for the whole runtime. The consistency is lacking big time here. They should have put more scenes explaining various powers of those special childs rather than putting all the efforts in other non essential confrontations.Enough judgements, In short I really liked the movie. I admire what Mike did with the adaptation of Stephen King's Novel here. Having said that; I must state, this should have been better. Taking into consideration the amount of genuine potential it got in its helm. Sadly the wasn't to be. But that doesn't mean it's bad by any means. Definitely a Solid watch and a special treat for Horror Fans. Just don't expect something extraordinary and you may fall in love with it.",Doctor Sleep
133,0w0,"Made me a little sleepy, but still a good movie",7,24 January 2020,"The movie is obviously better if you recently watched The Shining (1980), because Doctor Sleep (2019) has many references from the previous film sprinkled in this 3hour long movie, but the movie is perfectly watchable if you haven't watched The Shining yet.I honestly liked the movie, but a few things bothered me:#1. like how anti-climactic the fight was between the entire evil-crew and the good guys
#2. also the final fight was very anti-climactic
#3. I don't get why the dude did what he did at the very end... I mean, the story could have ended very differently, but instead it ended THAT way? I'd have prefered a different ending.Anyway, it's a good movie, but could have been an easy 8/10 if the above points were addressed differently.",Doctor Sleep

His script was not good. But, I feel conflicted because I am glad they did something new with an old brand - instead of just a reboot, remake, or prequel. And I feel creative new ideas or risks should be encouraged. The bad guys were the weakest part and had far too much screen time. The film needed more with Danny and the girl. And it needed more Overlook ghosts. Best part was the actor who played the old man from The Shining.",Doctor Sleep
135,MrDHWong,A solid follow-up to the horror classic that respectfully continues the story with entertaining results,8,7 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is the sequel to both Stephen King's novel ""The Shining"" and Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of the same name. Starring Ewan McGregor in the lead role, it is a solid follow-up to the horror classic that respectfully continues the story with entertaining results.Decades after his father tried to murder him and his mother, Danny Torrence (Ewan McGregor) has since grown up and turned to alcohol as a means to suppress his Shining ability. One day, Danny discovers through telepathy that a young girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran) shares the same Shining as him and that she is being pursued by The True Knot, a dangerous cult who preserve their immortality by consuming the essence of those who can Shine like them. Determined to protect her at all costs, Danny forms a telepathic bond with Abra and the two come up with ways to take the cult out before it's too late.In spite of the long-lasting impact its predecessor has left on pop culture, Doctor Sleep still manages to hold its own as a worthy sequel that creates its own separate identity altogether. There are indeed allusions to Kubrick's film sprinkled throughout the story, but they are used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which in turn avoids unfavourable comparisons. I did feel that there were times at the beginning that confused me as to what they even had to do with ""The Shining"" in the first place, whether it involved a character acting the way they did or a situation happening that seemed weirdly out of place. However, as the film went on, things started to make more sense as all of these odd moments began to slot into place. I haven't read Stephen King's original novel of ""The Shining"" so I am unsure how accurately this film follows on from it but from what I have read, he holds it in a positive regard.Director Mike Flanagan, who appears to be emerging as something of a modern horror maestro, handles this film with the right amount of care needed when making a sequel to such a classic film, especially from one helmed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick. While Flanagan doesn't quite capture the same eerie atmosphere of the original, he at least succeeds in keeping that same haunting sense of foreboding emanating throughout the plot. His choices in editing and cinematography are more modern, feeling considerably less artistic, which was one of the best things about Kubrick's film in the first place. This may have been done to distinguish itself from the original, but I feel as though this won't age the film too well as a result.I enjoyed the way in which the adult Danny Torrence was depicted in this film, thanks especially to the ever reliable Ewan McGregor bringing that tragic element to his character. Like father like son, Danny confides in alcohol to repress his insecurities while struggling to actually face these problems head on. Danny's scenes with Abra, played wonderfully by newcomer Kyliegh Curran, were so nice to watch, and it was fascinating seeing how they use their Shining powers to interact with each other.In conclusion, making a sequel to such an iconic film by an equally iconic director was a tall order but for the most part, it all worked out in the end. This one may not stand the test of time like its predecessor, but there is still plenty to enjoy if you like the original film as much as I did.I rate it 8/10",Doctor Sleep

137,Alexander_Blanchett,See what happened to Danny Torrence,8,22 November 2019,"It was a good and worthy sequel to the Stanley Kubrick classic ""The Shining"" and to Stephen King's ""The Shining"" I mention both artists because Kubrick's adaptation differed from King's novel and Mike Flanagan stays honest to both as well as King's sequel ""Doctor Sleep"". The good thing is that this is one of the rare occasions that an adaptation is better than the source novel. The film was as expected not coming close to Kubrick's original but manages to be quite a fine movie of its own. The story brings the ""Shining"" topic much more forward and shows more facettes of the questionable gift. For fans of the film it offers many references to ""The Shining"" some obvious ones and many hidden ones too. We see a return of Danny Torrence who now is played by Ewan McGregor who was tolerable enough and delivered an adaquard performance. More exciting was Rebecca Ferguson's performance. The ironic thing is her character was much weaker written and McGregors. She really gave it life. Great performance. Also newcomer Kyliegh Curran was very good. Mike Flanagan is the new master of Horror in my eyes. He really knows how to do terrifying and tense moments. I missed some of the terrifying scenes that even Brough me to grounds as in ""The Haunting of Hill House"" or even ""Gerard's Game"" but he still does a very good job, especially bringing the Overlook Hotel back to life.",Doctor Sleep

139,TheTruthofItIs,"Better titled as ""Twilight, the Shining""",4,23 February 2020,"Ewan McGregor, apparently petrified of type-casting in Star Wars, takes the role of a grown up Danny Torrance in this loooooong drawn out movie-of-the-week sequel to the classic ""The Shining"". Just shy of 3-hrs, I fell asleep twice but powered through to the end. It's not a horrible film, just unnecessarily long with pacing that is better described by the title ""Doctor Sleep"", which btw was only a tiny part of the story that will pretty much be edited out when it comes to network tv in a few years. The basic plot of a roving band of soul-eaters that feed off of ""special kids"" isn't bad, it's just presented in subpar fashion. There are flashbacks to the original ""Shining"" but since that was 40 years ago (!) they used stand-ins for the actors in the original roles, that will disappoint a few million and won't even bother a few other million since they're too young to even have watched re-runs of the original. Anyway, this could've and should've been a far more interesting/exciting film than it was, and that's due to a lack of competent writing, direction, and film editing - and whatdayaknow, it's all the same guy, a relatively unaccomplished Mike Flanagan.

141,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,29 December 2019,"The stage curtains open ...I know that Stephen King was never too keen on the vision that Stanley Kubrick brought to the screen in 1980 with his adaptation of King's 1977 novel, ""The Shining"". Now we have this 2019 adaptation of ""Doctor Sleep"", also penned by King, which picks up the story of Danny Torrance, over thirty years later. The movie is a sequel of sorts to both King's novel and Kubrick's movie.Young Danny has grown up and now goes by Dan. After his life shaking events in the Overlook Hotel, Dan has turned to alcohol to suppress the shining inside him. Soon, he meets and befriends a man in a small town who, in turn, helps him attend AA meetings and clean up his life. Dan finds respite in helping people know peace in the final hours of their life, earning him the nickname, Doctor Sleep. But when Abra Stone, a girl gifted with a strong shining, reaches out to him to help her escape the clutches of a group of psychic vampires who feed off of children with the shining - his world is turned upside down, and he finds himself once more walking through the halls of the Overlook Hotel for one more final encounter.I haven't yet read the Stephen King novel, but I really enjoyed this film. Knowing that King himself was behind this project made me even more eager to watch it. It pays homage to the vision that Kubrick gave us, but it also satisfies King's story and plot direction, with an ending that he supported. That was important to me. I personally loved Kubrick's movie, so I was hoping for some sort of tie-in there, and there was.The casting was good, the acting up to par, the cinematography was sharp and spot on, the special effects fitting to the story, and the pacing was good. The film does run on a bit long, but to tell you the truth, I was so invested into the movie, I didn't really notice it that much. ""Doctor Sleep"" is a good movie. It is a sequel that doesn't rely on sentimentality to draw you in. It stands on its own, yet it does measure up to ""The Shining"". I highly recommend this one at a strong 8 out of 10 stars.",Doctor Sleep

The concept doesn't look very bad but the way it was made felt like a very old crappy ghost movie.
There was really a poor engagement, no huge surprises, no big game plans, no thrills even with so many ghosts' characters playing around which makes this movie feel like a crappy movie. Although not everything was bad in it, the protagonist and the powerful kid did and the beautiful villainous witch/bitch gave us a somewhat engaging performance which was the only satisfaction that people would get out of this film.",Doctor Sleep
145,elicopperman,Impressive Followup to Two Acclaimed Classics,8,31 October 2019,"With the popularity of Stephen King's acclaimed novel The Shining came a followup known as Doctor Sleep. Recently, modern horror movie director Mike Flanagan has come out with his own feature film adaptation on said book (or at least in early screenings as of now), although it seems to follow up on the Stanley Kubrick adaptation of The Shining more so than the book. All of that being said though, this actually benefits the feature as a solid continuation of the beloved classic.Set years after the first film, Dan Torrance tries to find peace within himself and his psychic ""shine"" powers That chance is ruined however when another special girl named Abra seeks him out to stop the merciless Rose the Hat and her True Knot clan, who obtain immortality by sucking the shine out of others. As a result, Dan and Abra engage in a bizarre battle with Rose with their powers, even if it means Dan has to reawaken some old ghouls of the past. The two best characters in the whole film are Dan and Abra, mainly because Dan is trying to live in spite of his ""gift"" yet has to come to terms with the severe consequences from having it, and Abra is a brave child who refuses to see the innocent taken away at the hands of evil. Ewan McGregor and Kyliegh Curran have wonderful chemistry with each other, seeing as how their characters are constantly communicating with each other on how to take the villains down.In terms of how the film emulates the Kubrick film in both continuation and in style, it does make several referential callbacks yet only sparingly and manages to tell a solid story about good triumphing over the wicked. As Dan develops his way through past tragedies and alcoholism, it gives his character more of an edge that comes from the scars his father and other disturbing beings left on him. The cinematography and shot composition is the most imitative of Kubrick's visual language, although the digital cinematography can't help but make the film lack that special glow that made Kubrick's movie so creepy (the dark shades and colors are effective enough though). The music score is quite haunting in its own right whenever a certain scene plays out, yet there may be a few too many jump scare key notes that it makes the loud shocking moments feel almost ridiculous.As for other notable characters, Rose herself could have been just another cliched malicious soul eater bent on consuming all of mankind, but her stoic presence and the conniving performance by Rebecca Ferguson make her subtly menacing and chilling. The same can be said for most of her group, as they're either blood thirsty psychopaths without much control or manipulative monsters who are great at tricking others into falling in their trap. A few key characters from The Shining do appear in small yet effective roles that help give proper context into Dan's frightening childhood and disturbed adulthood; their scenes are brief but convey so much within his psyche. Anyone else are either poor victims of the True Knot clan's tricks or minor leads that are only effective depending on what happens in the story, yet the film's lead duo are so engaging that one could forgive their appearances for being so abrupt.Doctor Sleep is a strong example of turning the horrific concepts of Stephen King's literature into moving pictures and getting it right thanks to two intriguing leads, haunting atmosphere and a good blend of the familiar with something more recent. Granted, the film may appeal more to fans of The Shining in both book and movie form, as you may feel confused going into this blind. Regardless, check this out on Halloween and see if you think it lives up to the hype.",Doctor Sleep
146,ronakkotian,A compelling watch despite the flaws.,7,16 November 2019,"Making a film like Doctor Sleep must have been hard. The Shining is one of the best horror films made so Mike Flanagan had to please Kubrick fans whilst also trying to please Stephen King, who hates Kubrick's version of The Shining and wrote the book this film's based on. I think he did a good job.Doctor Sleep follows a grown up Dan Torrence who has to save a girl with the same powers as him from a cult who prey on kids with that ability.Mike Flanagan had a lot on his shoulders when it came to Doctor Sleep but judging from his past films, I thought he could handle it and he did. Whilst the film did feel slow and boring at the beginning, it did start to pick up and became quite compelling.I thought the villains in this film were one of the best of the year. There is a lot of focus put on them so we could understand their nature and motivations. Rebecca Ferguson, the main antagonist, did a fantastic job as Rose the Hat. She felt really sinister but charming at the same time. Kyleigh Curran gave a good child performance which surprised me as child performances are usually really bad. Finally, I thought Ewan McGregor was a great choice to play Dan Torrence.The film may be too long but the story does become engaging as the pacing gets faster. The whole mood is very depressing with an ugly green tint that shows it and there are a couple of disturbing scenes, one including Jacob Tremblay which was the most effective. Mike Flanagan did a great job directing and tried to cater to both audiences as much as possible. Some of the Kubrick elements felt a bit forced, the jumpscares were overused and the 3rd act just seemed a tad thrown together but overall it didn't overpower the movie's strengths.Doctor Sleep is well made and I have to praise Mike Flanagan for taking on a difficult project like this with full confidence. The characters are well written and interesting to witness. The acting all around was good and there were some spooky and disturbing scenes which were executed well. I wouldn't say it's a must watch but if you're a fan of Flanagan's work then you may be impressed by this.",Doctor Sleep
147,garethcrook,So this is a stupid idea surely?...,6,2 February 2020,"....A sequel to The Shining. I know the book existed, but that doesn't mean we need the film. It is lovely to be back in the Overlook Hotel though, even if much of the opening scenes steal directly from the iconic original. It's a little off putting though, like a recap montage at the beginning of a serialised drama. What's more annoying is Alex Essoe's attempt at impersonating Shelley Duvall. It's well documented what Kubrick put Duvall through to get that performance, to even attempt what Essoe does is insulting. I'll the curb the criticism though for a minute, for what follows does have a little merit. We pick up with an adult Danny Torrance, played by Ewan McGregor revisiting his junkie screw-up days of Trainspotting, but with a beard and without the cool soundtrack. He now finds himself out in the world with many others who Shine and they're not all as nice as Scatman Crothers. I guess that's an inevitable story progression and that's a good word to summarise this, inevitability, but it does still have lots of suitably creepy moments. It lacks style though, with its bloated cast of characters, but McGregor does a decent job as he begins to find purpose, meaning, stability and how to be the good guy. It seems a little sad that this film puts a purpose to Shining, boiling it down to good vs evil, simplifying it, lifting its mystique and painting it as some sort of vampiric zombie derivative. Maybe that's all it ever was, but Kubrick's film had subtlety. This borrows so much, but doesn't repay it and I'm genuinely disgusted as the final act begins to unfold. The phrase 'Don't mess with the classics' was clearly never considered. Yet despite all this, I found this oddly enjoyable to a point, sacrilegious as it is. It's fun in places, but not really enough to make up for its lack of originality and I mean complete and utterly devoid of originality. Granted I suppose it's supposed to be a sequel and therefore should be allowed these assets to play with, but I was left shaking my head, rolling my eyes and laughing at the laziness. I was right, stupid idea.",Doctor Sleep
148,Azanspy,A decent movie as it's own.,7,23 January 2020,"Even though Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining, it should be considered as an individual movie. Because they haven't done anything similar to The Shining apart from the continuation of story and some homages. Doctor Sleep is a well made slow burn thriller. Even though it comes under the label of horror, there's nothing that keeps us scared. But the movie works as a good thriller. The overall tone of the movie is what I liked the most. The cinematography was really good and the movie is a visual spectacular. The background music was also intriguing with some small duel beats throughout the movie. Ewan McGregor did a good job along with the new vampires headed by an excellent Rebecca Ferguson. Overall, Doctor Sleep is a decent slow chiller with very good making.",Doctor Sleep
149,Aylmer,Doctor Woke,6,21 December 2020,"I have to first point out that this film is extremely well-crafted and mostly well-acted and almost all of its issues lie in its scripting and casting.This film does to THE SHINING what 2010 did to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in that it takes a pretty slow-going and obtuse first film and significantly spells things out and dumbs things down to bring us more action and more spelled out events. This is both good and bad, depending on your perspective as I found THE SHINING to be a bit plodding anyway. It did however succeed in bringing us a heavy creep factor because it had a single location, sparing use of superpowers and supernatural, and a unity of vision throughout. The tone here shifts from scene to scene, seeming like a mystery one moment, a vampire movie the next, and then an action movie the next... then back to horror. I appreciate the variety of experiences here but to me it feels unfocused and too bent on crowd-pleasing. At 3 hours in length, it does feel like they crammed in way too much for it to ever really breathe.It's also a lot like Marvel's recent LOGAN movie in that it follows a tired, world-wearing superhero who befriends and may possibly ""pass the torch"" to a young girl who is even more powerful than he is. What LOGAN had that this movie doesn't, was a significant degree of tension. Never once do we feel that the lady in the hat poses a significant threat to the heroes and they get involved in trying to stop her and her vampire posse purely by choice. The little girl is much too powerful, confident, and easily shakes off whatever setbacks come her way. She doesn't feel like a real person and (dare I say it?) a bit of a Mary Sue.The heavy emphasis on diversity in casting becomes distracting, especially in the vampire gang with equal representation of seemingly all creeds and ethnic groups among them. It's as though the diversity and inclusion police were standing off-screen checking off boxes all through the casting process... which you'll either admire or loathe depending on your level of wokeness.That said, as far as late sequels go, it doesn't tread too heavily on the original film (which I never really cared for anyway) and squeezes most of the annoying fan service into the beginning and end. Much like with the scenes from THE ROOM in THE DISASTER ARTIST, a lot of the fun comes in seeing how closely they're able to re-enact scenes from the original movie. There's some pretty successful laughs sprinkled out often coming from Ewen McGregor's conversation with imaginary friends even with people around him.",Doctor Sleep
150,davidgee,Spooky return to The Overlook,8,8 November 2019,"Stephen King was said to be unhappy with Stanley Kubrick's take on THE SHINING. I was too: key elements of the novel were excluded, and Jack Nicholson seemed completely manic from the outset, which diluted his transition to psychopathic under the influence of the hotel's ghostly residents. Hopefully Mr King is happier with the movie of his belated sequel; he co-wrote the screenplay with director Mike Flanagan.The 'cannibalization' of teenagers makes for a much nastier tale than a haunted hotel. This is a long picture (two and a half hours) but it rarely flags. The flashbacks to Danny's boyhood recreate very exactly highlights from the Kubrick movie. It's hard to say which is scarier, revisiting The Overlook or Rose the Hat and her gang of life-stealers, but I can say that this is a thriller-chiller that may haunt your dreams for longer than THE SHINING did.",Doctor Sleep

154,baileycrawly,A Bit of a Missed Opportunity,8,29 March 2020,"I'm a big Stephen King fan, but I hated his novel ""The Shining."" I'm also a big Stanley Kubrick fan, who thought that the changes made for his adaptation of King's novel were fine, if not strictly essential. The novel had a tendency to ramble (as does most of King's work, but The Shining was always unbearably so), and Kubrick really took the best of the book and left the rest behind.Fast forward to 2019. Kubrick has now passed away, King has produced a miniseries version of The Shining in 1997 that was a far too faithful reproduction of the book (much to the chagrin of the television-viewing public), and he has written a sequel to The Shining. As always happens with a Stephen King book, film rights were sent out almost as quickly as the publisher scooped up the novel in an attempt to cash in on the iconic status of The Shining.And then you have this. Doctor Sleep.You're making a sequel to one of the most famous and influential moments in horror history. You're making a sequel to a novel that told a very different story. And in the middle you have Stephen King, who, I'm sure, didn't want any of Kubrick's vision (or nods to it). What do you do?This movie is a nice enough compromise. The creative team managed to get King to relent a little bit and allow ties to Kubrick's work. This film wouldn't have made it without those.What you get at the end of the day is an all right product. A bit of a missed opportunity, however. I would've taken to this film much more favourably had they started with the original. Remake the movie in a loving homage to Stanley Kubrick AND Stephen King simultaneously (as this movie did), then use the cast from that to work with this story. Sure, the Danny Lloyd, Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall look-alikes were great in their roles, but I would've liked to have seen them assume the roles in the context of the original movie first.That being said, this movie was... fine. To sound like a broken record.There are three different plots here and there isn't a whole lot of of prevalence given to one or the other, making this movie feel a little unfocused. The characters, while extremely well acted, were a little under-developed, further proving the point that there's only so much you can do when you take something from one medium and try to replicate it in another.The ultimatum is that I don't hate this movie. I'm a huge Kubrick fan, as I stated, and I'll still be loyal to his creation. I like that this movie took some of the elements of the original book that Kubrick left out and adapted them in a way that didn't feel like it was kissing Stephen King's ass. It doesn't really have to exist, but I guess I'm kinda glad that it does. It doesn't offer any additional context or insight into the characters, but it gives a decent enough story to pass a few hours. Like the moment that inspired King to write the novel in the first place ,it's akin to spending time with old friends you haven't heard from in a while. It served its purpose well enough.I watched the Director's Cut.",Doctor Sleep

156,dfle3,"Doctor Sleep. Soporific title. You'd never guess that it was a sequel to ""The shining"". 72.5%",7,13 November 2019,"Firstly, you really should watch ""The shining"" before you consider watching this, as it is a continuation of the story of Dan Torrance from that film and so you will see massive spoilers in ""Doctor Sleep"" should you ever one day decided to see ""The shining"". That statement is by itself an unfortunate spoiler on my part!Secondly, I would definitely have been interested in watching a sequel to ""The shining"" but, unfortunately, this connection might be a tad obscure going on the title and the poster for the film! It would be easy to not notice (as I didn't) that the boy on the tricycle is a familiar looking image. Let's not even mention how dull a film called ""Doctor Sleep"" sounds. Maybe the filmmakers have hobbled their chances with this move? Dirty birdy!Thirdly, I can't say that I've ever pondered how ""The shining"" might have been continued...or ended after the events which transpired. Nor have I pondered whatever became of Danny Torrance. In any case, I was interested to see ""Doctor Sleep"" as soon as I found out about its connection to a film that I grew to appreciate much more than I did initially (my first impression of ""The shining"" was negative, as I was a teenage boy in high school hearing from his peers that this was some sort of horrific movie...which it definitely wasn't. i.e. it wasn't the gore-fest that I was expecting).In any case, ""Doctor Sleep"" sees Dan Torrance (played by Ewan McGregor) as a grown man now, in his mid-thirties. There are still bad things in the world which mean him and others like him harm. One person like him, who has ""the shine"" (""the shining"". This is a 'sixth' sense) is a little black girl, Abra Stone (played by Kyliegh Curran). There are some nasty things which are hungry for her. We get to see how this dramatic tension plays out.I did wonder how ""Doctor Sleep"" would play as cinema, as I grew to highly regard the visual/aural artistry of ""The shining"" (I also reviewed the earlier film here, too). You can't say that it brings any cinema magic of its own to the table but it does replay or redo those memorable moments from the first film. The best example of that cinema-as-art quality is where Danny, as a young boy, rides around on his tricycle at the Overlook Hotel. I got the impression that that scene from ""The shining"" is replayed in ""Doctor Sleep"" although they may have recreated it instead?Apart from being self-referential, this film did remind me of other films or TV shows, or have echoes of them. For instance, the scenes with 'the breath of life'/'dying breath' reminded me of some children's film, I think, which I can't remember the name of, perhaps because I never saw more than the scene which triggered this recollection. Perhaps it was a film which starred David Bowie? I don't know. Another connection that I made was to the classic TV series ""Buffy the vampire slayer"", as far as the 'monster of the week' goes. You could, perhaps, also throw in a classic TV show like ""The X-Files"", which also had a 'monster of the week'. These are visual cues which I picked up or just going on how certain characters are in this world.The film isn't particularly scary, or creepy, but if you are a parent, I think that one scene in it, involving a little boy, is enough to give you nightmares and haunt you. The actor, Jacob Tremblay, I believe, does a very believable (I would imagine!) scream of terror. It's quite a confronting scene for that reason, as well as the violence involved, which, to be fair, isn't extreme by horror movie standards. Just by the by, this element of film brought to mind that American moral panic concerning Satanic ritual abuse, which never really actually occurred. In a way, this film is a representation of something analogous to it actually being real (by the by, that Satanic ritual abuse topic was brought up in an interesting edition of Radio National's ""Big ideas"" programme yesterday, 12/11/2019. which is available online).In my review earlier today of ""Joker"", I mentioned ""dreamlike"" editing which made you not notice a slide from one context to another. That happened here too. Early on in the film, I thought that I was seeing young Danny only at the Overlook Hotel. I'm not sure if you can put that down to an effect that the filmmaker wanted to make (a dreamlike state) or...just bad editing, which ends up confusing the viewer.It should be noted that the world of ""Doctor Sleep"" is an extension of the world of ""The shining"", as in a new element is introduced, as far as the nature of the horror that Danny has to face. To be honest, I'm not sure that these two worlds properly gelled, but I warmed to the film in time and forgave its differences to the earlier film, hence my decent score for it. I'll have to assume that this new element is faithful to Stephen King's novel (I've only read ""The shining"" but may, 'one of these days' seek out ""Doctor Sleep"" to read) and, as it presents in this film, there is the sense that King wants to explain too much about the nature of the horror, removing some of the mystery. The problem with that move though, is that there is a danger that the thing which is supposed to be 'explained' by the author or filmmaker becomes merely incoherent (e.g. does this old line now work as it should in the sequel: ""Come and play with us...Forever""?). Maybe more work needed to be done to tie things together, but to me they don't seem to mix.Miscellaneous:* Interesting as far as employment opportunities in America goes. For Australia, such scenes relegate the film to the status of science fiction or magic realism!* Odd choice for the final shot of Danny and him mum together. Why is he that age at this time?* I've read that the author of ""The shining"", Stephen King, disliked the film version of it. He really likes this adaptation of ""Doctor Sleep"", even though it draws on parts of the film version of ""The shining"" (as well as differing from his own sequel, which he criticised Kubrick's film for doing for the original!). King's own adaptation of ""The shining"", a miniseries, was very poor, in my view but I saw that before I began writing reviews online. Avoid it.",Doctor Sleep

Then came Ready Player One, with a great tribute. Finally Stephen King himself wrote a very good sequel, and of course I hoped for a movie. A great cast, and some great callbacks to the Shining.

160,sunznc,"Starts out good, spirals into mediocrity",4,13 April 2020,"Doctor Sleep isn't a bad film but aside from a couple of scenes it feels like a made-for-TV film. It actually would be a better sequel to the made-for-TV The Shining that was made after the original theatrical film.We've seen this scenario before. A group of nomadic people sense and hunt down others who have a strength that either they need to strengthen their group or themselves individually. We saw something very similar in ""Near Dark"" with a lower budgeted group of vampires.And the last 45 minutes were so predictable that when they finally came into play it was rather a let down. We already knew what was going to happen. Very much lacking in originality. In fact, some of it very, very tired.",Doctor Sleep
161,TwistedContent,An Imaginative & Rich Sequel that Stands on its Own,8,22 November 2019,"Despite what You might hear about its box office failure and rumors cultivated by that, Mike Flanagan keeps doing his thing successfully & this time around it's even more impressive. Why? He nailed the challenge of respecting both King and Kubrick, because, as we know, the one movie Stephen King hated was ""The Shining"". You know, shame on everyone who didn't enjoy the 2 and a half hour long beautiful experience of ""Doctor Sleep"" on the big screen.
Of course, ""Doctor Sleep"" is not a masterpiece, not in my eyes, but it has great many things to offer. An eerie ghost story, a supernatural thriller, a creepy adult fairy tale - ""Doctor Sleep"" is more like that than a typical horror movie. The many qualities include pleasant performances - Ewan McGregor nailed the role of an adult Danny Torrance, Kyliegh Curran is a convincing as the new main hero & Rebecca Ferguson delivered a villain that actually exceeded my quite skeptical expectations. The first hour feels a little choppy story-wise, but all comes together nicely with time, however, I have to admit that it was a little too predictable. I agree with a lot of people that ""Doctor Sleep"" slightly overplayed the greatest hits of ""The Shining"", but in the moment of watching all of that I was nothing short of amazed. The production design, cinematography, sound design and original score were all top notch, can't pick on anything at all, bravo. There's at least one sequence that I will remember for a long time - and that's a huge compliment. A lot of people worry about pacing, understandably so because it's a pretty long movie, but I can in all honesty say that it felt like any other good movie just under 2 hours. So remains the question, how is ""Doctor Sleep"" as a sequel? And the answer is: Solid. Is it a better movie? No. Is it a great movie? Yes.
To be honest, I'm having a hard time reviewing this - it's been a week since I saw it. I could not pinpoint why it's an 8 and not more or less, but I can tell you that it's one of the top 10 horror movies of 2019, both indies and big screen movies included.",Doctor Sleep

Adapting Stephen King for the big screen is one thing, trying to follow up a Kubrick movie is another, and it's credit to Flanagans film that it does at least try to hold it's own for as long as possible before giving in to the itch and playing a few too many of the greatest hits from the original movie. Ewan McGregor is great as the grown up Danny Terrence, who ends up helping a young girl called Abra (Kyliegh Curran) who shares a similar gift to his own. Pursued by a relentless Vampire like cult called the True Knot led by the evil Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), who feed off the shine of innocent kids in a quest for immortality, Danny returns to the Overlook hotel from which he escaped with his mother, to ""wake it up."" Flanagan who had previously adapted Geralds Game (another King adaptation), brings a fresher sense of fun to the party than Kubrick did (Stephen King HATED his adaptation of The Shining). It's scary when it wants to be, but also features some pretty far out scenes such as astral projection.

165,ericrnolan,"""Doctor Sleep"" (2019) Was Absolutely Fabulous.",10,12 November 2019,"I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailer - yet it exceeded my expectations. I'd easily rate this a 10 out of 10.This is a story-driven horror film just brimming with blackly creative ideas and weird world-building - I haven't read Stephen King's source material, but I feel certain this was a loving adaptation of the 2013 novel. It is also genuinely touching at times. (I was trying to explain to a dear friend recently about how King's work can surprise the uninitiated - the monsters and devils typically occupy only a portion of his imaginary landscapes. The remainder is inhabited by good people who are bravely doing the right thing.)All of the movie's story elements are painted vibrantly by Mike Flanagan's beautiful screenwriting and nightmarishly trippy directing. The film's action and often incongruously bright visuals are reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's visions in ""The Shining"" (1980), to which this film is truly a worthy successor. (Flanagan was the director and screenwriter for last year's fantastic ""The Haunting of Hill House."" The qualities that you loved about the Netflix show can also be found in ""Doctor Sleep"" - in some ways, they are very similar stories.)Rebecca Ferguson is mesmerizing as the story's antagonist, Kyliegh Curran is pitch perfect as the young anti-hero, and Ewan McGregor is predictably terrific.The only quibbles I had were minor - there was one plot device (presumably from the novel) that didn't translate well to the screen. It concerns how the bad guys replenish themselves ... I'll bet it worked well in King's prose, but it seemed corny and cliche when visualized on film.You could also argue that ""Doctor Sleep's"" constant references to ""The Shining"" were pretty heavy-handed. But that didn't bother me too much ... I arrived at the conclusion that ""The Shining"" and ""Doctor Sleep"" were really two halves of an epic supernatural road trip. Your mileage may vary.One final caveat - this film does portray violence against children. It isn't extremely graphic, but it's still especially disturbing. (It technically isn't gratuitous, I suppose, because there is an in-universe reason why Ferguson's tribe of villains targets the young.)This is easily the best horror film that I've seen in years. Go see it.",Doctor Sleep
166,Mike_Devine,A new chapter of an old masterpiece,7,26 July 2020,"Stephen King's universe has proven to be one that has stood the test of time. There is no one else who has had more influence in the horror genre than he, and the film adaptation of his 'The Shining' follow-on was a bit different from others but still featured familiar undertones that make it unmistakably part of his franchise.In 'Doctor Sleep,' we see Ewan McGregor portray the adult Danny Torrance as he tries to put a stop to a cult of semi-immortals led by Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) who get their strength from the lives and shinings of children. Heavy stuff, for sure. In fact, there's one scene in particular that's so terrible and uncomfortable that it threatens the rest of the film - but it really underscores just how evil this traveling cruel circus is.Overall, the film is a well-paced (albeit long) journey that features plenty of frightening moments that are enough to satisfy those looking for a scare. While McGregor and Ferguson do respectable jobs here, it's clear that Kyliegh Curran's young prodigy Abra Stone is the highlight of 'Sleep"" - she should have a bright future in the industry.It's not the greatest King adaptation, sure. But alongside other recent efforts like the revamped 'It,' 'Doctor Sleep' is representative of what's possible in a new generation of thrillers based on classic novels from the storied author.",Doctor Sleep

I cannot express how much I loved ""Doctor Sleep"". A film that stays true to its source material and even pays homage to Kubrick's take on ""The Shining"". The scenes where you see a young Danny blew my mind. Ewan McGregor is terrific and newcomer Kyliegh Curran is sensational. The scene stealer has to be Rebecca Ferguson; she plays one of the most complex villains I've seen in a while. An incredible turn for the actress. Editor, writer and director Mike Flanagan continues his strive into the horror genre and doesn't disappoint. This is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever, so be sure not to Overlook ""Doctor Sleep"".

At a later point in the movie a Jack Nicholson impersonator also joins the proceedings (only it's an uncredited, in IMDB, actor playing Nicholson playing the barman Lloyd). These could, of course, have been terrible missteps but director Mike Flanagan adeptly carries it off, just.In fact the entire movie is a dangerous exercise in, just, getting away with it.It neatly explains some of the mysteries of the much cherished The Shining movie, but steps away from the mostly unspoken horror of Kubrick's classic to become a sort of Harry Potter fantasy.So, strangely the first 20 minutes and the last thirty (both truest to the original) are the most satisfying.In the middle lies a pretty stodgy lump of twaddle really (Flanagan both directs and edits, which contributes to the stodge) and centres on a curious interplay between Ewan MacGregor, as the whisky soaked but recovering alcoholic that Danny has turned into, another shiner, played well enough by 13 year old Kyleigh Curran (her character name Abra is a pretty clunky pun) and a radiant Rebecca Ferguson, as the arch villain and leader of gang of bad 'shiners',McGregor is tolerable, not something I'd often say, playing the part understatedly.It is what it is.This is not even a patch on its predecessor but there are just about enough pluses to keep you involved for its challenging 210 minute run time.A curiosity, I'd say, that committed Shining fans, like me, should on balance, go see.Just.",Doctor Sleep

The effects are not a dog and pony show instead they underline just in the right amount and intensity whenever needed.

I don't really know the answer, it's different for everyone. For me this was such a movie. The story continues from The Shinning (1980) with Danny the young boy from that movie later in life. How the story unfolds is in Chapters. So it could have been played out in a mini series with each chapter being an episode. Perhaps this is why it holds your interest. The pacing is relaxed but never ever drags. The characters each have a tail to tell. It's a movie quite unlike most others in this day and age.

During his rehabilitation, he encounters two new friends, one of which is a little girl who has similar abilities to him. All the while, there's a cult roaming around America on the prowl for souls to feed on, led by the charismatic Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). I absolutely love the moody atmosphere and creepy approach this film had; adapted for the screen by writer/Director Mike Flanagan, it was bound to have something special considering how masterful his adaptation of King's Gerald's Game was (please watch on Netflix if you haven't caught it yet!). Much like the iconic author, he has a deep understanding of how to realise nightmares through an art form. The amazing soundtrack composed by the Newton Brothers (The Haunting Of Hill House, Hush) is a massive factor also to the claustrophobic anxiety of the central character; there's a pulsing heartbeat to be heard throughout the film which is cleverly incorporated. McGregor is brilliantly cast as Danny who captures the downtrodden aspect of the past weighing big down on him so well as well as his new approach to life becoming a nurse and helping people. Kyliegh Curran and Cliff Curtis are also brilliant in their roles! There are certain scenes that will stay with me for a long time, such as Danny being haunted in his bed by a woman and her child and the conversations had between Danny and the patients in his workplace. Visually it's also a treat, with the inevitable journey back to the dreaded Overlook Hotel being a fantastic example. It's not without its flaws (the rendering of new actors in scene recreations of The Shining can be really distracting and Rose The Hat's greeting that becomes a bizarre catchphrase gets annoying quite fast) but the overall effect is incredible; it's genuinely unsettling, well written and it's a must watch in horror/thriller cinema right now",Doctor Sleep

director: Mike Flanagan
starring:Ewan Mcgregor,Rebecca Ferguson,Kyleigh Curan,Cliff Curtis, Zahn mcclaren,Emily Alyn Lynd etcoverall rating 83/100Doctor sleep follows the story of Danny ( Ewan Mcgregor) as he tries to rebuild his life after an alcohol addiction. And he discovers that there is a girl with shining powers like him. But a gang of shining stealers grow an obsession with finding Danny and Abra (Kyliegh Curan) due to there powers being the most powerful they have ever seen. This surprised me doctor sleep was fantastic with a key standout from Rebecca ferguson.First of all the film had a very tense tone and well executed jumpscares. The film didn't have to many jumpscares but for the first time since watching horror films i felt like this didnt need to. As the ones we got were so well executed that they genuinely caught you off guard which are the best form of jumpscares. And the film managed to have a very tense and uncomfortable tone. This is largely due to the actions of Rose the hat ( Rebecca ferguson) i would like to praise Mike flanagan for not being afraid to push the boundaries with the victimes of the gang. The fact that they targeted young children for better souls to take due to there innocence was interesting. And i have to praise the performance of Jacob tremblay who is fantastic in whatever he is in. It just really added impact to the scenes and made you dislike the antagonists even more which made there eventual defeat that bit more satisfying.Next i loved all the links to the shining. I loved that they bought back the hotel all the characters associated with the first film. It was just very nostalgic seeing the bath scene and the blood etc. And it was all executed well and mostly in a fresh way despite being overused in places.Next i thought the film could of been a bit more scary. I thought Doctor sleep could of pushed the boundaries slightly more to make it that bit more scary. I just thought they could of perhaps added more scenes involving Rose the hat and her gang and how many people they kill. And had more interesting scenes involving Abra and Rose the Hat which they dabbled in slightly with one of the best scenes in the film but they could of just gone that one step scarier.Next i thought the performances in the film were fantastic. In particular Ewan Mcgregor,Kyliegh Curan and rebecca ferguson. Ewan mcgregor was fantastic here. His performance really did show the conflict of alcohol abuse and fighting to overcome that addiction really well with a authentic and believable performance which further proves how underrated he is. Next Kyliegh Curan was fantastic. She showed tremendous talent for such a young actress here and her character was very interesting and clever. And it was interesting to see her relationship with Ewan. But for me the key standout performance was Rebecca ferguson. I personally thought her performance was terryfying. Just the way she introduced herself to everyone with her accent gave me shivers every time she talked. And her actions with killing made her a great villain to hate. One thing however that i have to say about Ewan Mcgregors charecter danny is that he felt more like a side character in his own movie. I just felt as if the focus was more on Abra and Rose and that the focus was taken off his character a bit to much. Therefore leading to me feeling like i was watching two separate movies in places.Now for my final two positives the script was fantastic and the final act was great. I thought the script for this was incredible. It made both the protagonists and antagonists stand out. And there was some key phrases about the world being a giant hospice and most of Rebecca fergusons lines were just fantastic. And it really made you think about what people were saying which is rare in films these days. And the whole concept of Danny being called doctor sleep was really heartfelt and clever as well. And plus the final act was fantastic. They bought it back to where it all started at the hotel. Despite some obviously familiar characters they still found a way to make it feel fresh and new as well as nostalgic. With Rose the Hat getting the advantage many times it kept you second guessing what was going to happen.Overall despite the film needing to have more links between the characters to make a more narratively coherent movie. Doctor sleep offers fantastic performances,clever scripts and terrifying chills.",Doctor Sleep

The imagery I had in my mind from the book, the moving shrubs, the maze, etc it all was portrayed so incredibly well in the movie.. it has to be one of the best book to movies ever in as far as making the movie like the bookI'd no idea this movie, the sequel had been made. I never read this book either but I'm going to now. But this movie was so great, the story, the progression from the Shining, it was perfect. That's all I can say.. it was perfect.While The Shining was as scary a movie as I've ever seen, this one was more cerebral and while there were plenty moments of Horror and I know for certain it takes much more to scare me at the age of 57 than it did at 16... this movie was still chilling. I had several spine shivering moments. I can't believe I'm just now watching it.One great movie...

185,WalkdenEntertainment,"Be at peace, it's a worthy sequel!",8,16 November 2019,"For those who are not aware, Doctor Sleep is based on a best selling novel by Stephen King. This film is also a sequel to the 1980s horror hit ""The Shining"". Those who are passionate about Stephen King's novels will be happy to find that unlike ""The Shining"", Doctor Sleep does in fact stick to the elements from the novel.Doctor Sleep is set many years after the tragic events that took place during ""The Shining"". Our sequel is now focused on Dan Torrance, Aka Little Danny, who is now a fully grown adult (played by Ewan McGregor). In the present day Dan spends his life keeping his Shining abilities to himself and enjoys staying drunk to avoid hearing voices. Dan soon cleans up and uses his ""Shining"" abilities to help others who are struggling in life. Dan also meets a young girl who appears to have similar (perhaps) the same powers to him. This little girl is wanted by a strange cult. It's now up to Dan to protect the young girl from those who hunt children and enjoy feeding on their powers. This cult calls themselves ""The True Knot"". The cult's leader is a mysterious, immortal woman who calls herself ""Rose The Hat"" (played by Rebecca Ferguson).Being a huge fan of the 1st instalment (recently reviewed with a perfect 10/10 score), I naturally was eager to see this new sequel.Ewan McGregor's performance as the grown up version of Dan/Danny is very good and his portrayal of the young boy we once knew is believable and convincing.As a plot, there's also a fresh story to tell. While the film enjoys giving nods to the original film, the film's main core and heart is a new story rather than a repeat of the old, even more so once Dan communicates with a young girl who may also have ""The Shining"". The relationship between these two is also positive. It didn't take me long as an audience member to get invested in this film and become eager to go on this new journey. I also found myself cheering Dan on as he goes into protection mode to save the girl from this creepy and unusual cult.As for the cult, it's also enjoyable to see them on screen and understand more about their world. Rebecca Fergusson also gives one of my favourite performance from her.Final praise points has to go the film's unique style of filming along with its audio tracks. Hearing the old ""The Shining"" theme track in the speakers lit my face up with a big grin. Sound effects also play a huge part in this film and honestly, it's just a perfect mix (especially when one's heart is beating fast...)Overall, while Doctor Sleep doesn't out do the original movie ""The Shining"", I'm still thankful to say that this is a solid sequel which will please many movie lovers. It's a new, exciting next chapter with a good story to tell and with a fantastic performance by Ewan McGregor and fellow cast members that welcomes audience members into engaging with the plot. I can easily recommend this film and it feels refreshing to see something new that ticks lots of boxes.8.3/10

186,movieman6-413-929510,Mike Flanagan tries to keep a balance for the book and film fans.,7,10 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is the almost 40-year continuation of horror classic The Shining. This sequel is directed and written by Mike Flanagan, the director of Oculus, Hush and Ouija: Origin of Evil.Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) has grown up in the film. He has left his traumatized childhood experiences behind and his gift of the Shining under control. In the state of New Hampshire, Dan reports to an AA community to control his alcohol addiction. He gets a job here at a nursing home where he knows how to use his gift for good purposes. In this way he seems to be able to live his life in a normal, calm way. When Dan gets a telepathic connection with the young girl Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) with his Shining gift, he learns that a cult called the True Knot led by Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson) hunts for people who also have a Shining gift. When the True Knot has spotted Abra and her gift and now come after her, Dan must learn to use his own gift again to help Abra. For this, he must again confront his childhood traumas.Mike Flanagan had a difficult task with this sequel to satisfy both the fans of the movie The Shining and the Stephen King book Doctor Sleep with this sequel. Stephen King is the author of both books, but was not satisfied with Stanley Kubrick's film version of The Shining. Mike Flanagan first had to convince Stephen King to use elements from the Shining film in this new film. With this film he tries to keep a balance between the different elements to both the fans of the books and the film. keep satisfied. Fans have to take into account that they will see both elements from the film and the book in this new film. This film really sounds like a film adaptation of a Stephen King book, but it also has some elements that you can see in a Stanley Kubrick film. Some elements from the Kubrick film have been placed a bit too repeatedly or exaggeratedly in this new film, such as the return of known places, events or characters. Mike Flanagan also tries to maintain a balance in the film between the different characters. This way you understand how characters with a Shining gift feel or behave, but you also get to see why characters from the True Knot now hunt people with a Shining gift. This way you as a viewer understand both sides of the story.
As a horror film, this film is fortunately not filled with too many simple jump scares, but Mike Flanagan, just like Stanley Kubrick, manages to keep the film exciting with an uncertain and horrible atmosphere. The film is more exciting than really scary.Ewan McGregor does good acting as an older version of Dan Torrance. He comes across as someone who tries to leave his traumatized past behind and with good deeds tries to help others. Kyliegh Curran also provides well-fitting work in this film for a young novice actress. Rebecca Ferguson also provides fun acting as the leader of the True Knot. She knows how to create some exciting moments, but is never as intense as Jack Nicholson was in The Shining.",Doctor Sleep
187,eskimosound,Urm... horrible subject matter...,6,31 March 2020,"Not sure what to make of this movie, it's brilliantly cast and acted but I think the subject matter is inappropriate. The Shining (of which this is the sequel) wasn't about child abduction and murder so why this took that turn I don't know.
So in that respect it is horrible....
So I don't know..it's a horror, it's sad but that's sort of glossed over..I dunno..:(",Doctor Sleep
188,theromanempire-1,A....Sequel to the shining ? I DON'T THINK SO....,1,9 November 2019,"First of all this mediocre movie has nothing to do with the shining.
in fact it's far worse and it alters everything we know about the shining.
cubric's masterpiece was about the powers the house had and drove jack nikolson mad.
now we get another twist. hungry evil creatures eat those with special powers.
a total different approach which has more to do with the .... supernatural series than with the shining movies.....(remember we had a remake also years ago).
Apart from that the movie was poor to say the least and it's at best an average film u may like it if u are in to supernatural world but I give it 1 star cause i'm pissed of they advertised it as the shining sequel when in all the things that matter.......IT'S NOT.
so in reality this gets like 4 out of 10 from me but cause they lured me in to thinking I will watch another......shining movie I will give it....1 out of 10 and that 1 bonus is cause I really love......THE GREAT STEVEN KING......LOL",Doctor Sleep

191,pranayjalvi,A sequel which is worthy,7,11 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep, releasing after 40 years of the original, was one of the anticipated movies of this year. I must say that it didn't disappoint. Mike Flanagan, known for his direction of horror movies like Oculus, The Haunting of Hill House was given the task and he ensured he did it right.I can't say it was better than the first one but yes it was indeed a to see Danny Torrance once again and this was more supernatural than being violent.I would go with 3.5/5 for Doctor Sleep",Doctor Sleep
192,chubarova,Amazing film.,9,12 June 2020,"Before watching this film I had some doubts about it, because ""The shining"" was great, and after all this time making sequel looked very strange. Fortunately, I was wrong. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it's busier and shows more places. Also it expands the main story about people with ""shining"". It looks like good thriller. Secondly, the cast is great, Ewan McGregor is amazing, but I'm a little bit disappointed because I didn't see Jack Nicholson.
So, it's awesome thriller that continues story of ""The shining"".",Doctor Sleep
193,Jerghal,Nice for Shining fans but not a classic,7,25 January 2020,"I wasn't sure in what way this movie was connected to The Shining to which it is the official sequel.
Well some scenes are recreated with other actors, so no CGI versions or altered images.
Doctor Sleep is about Danny (or Doc), the kid who's father went rather nuts in The Shining. He had a rough life but managed to contain the demons from the Overlook hotel and moves to another town to start again. But off course there are other evildoers at large...
It clocks in at 2,5 hours and actually feels a bit like a TV series. It's good entertainment and it keeps you interested and engaged but takes a decent while to get going.
McGregor does a decent job, but the star of the movie is Rebecca Furgusson as she makes for a charismatic antagonist.
As most movies these days it's not actually very scary but it has a good atmosphere and has good production values.
I guess it's a recommended watch for Shining fans but I won't be watching this again anytime soon, because of the length and also because it's far from a classic.
7,5/10 for me!",Doctor Sleep
194,Aly200,A worthy sequel to a classic Stephen King story,8,31 October 2019,"Little over three decades after penning the eerie ""The Shining"", Stephen King decided to write a sequel that follows Danny (now going by Dan) Torrance dealing with the trauma he once endured at the infamous Overlook. Now director Mike Flanagan set his directorial acumen on adapting this work two years after his success with ""Gerald's Game"" for Netflix. Thankfully the director didn't falter in bringing this King book to the big screen.The basic plot follows the tormented Dan as he is once again forced to confront danger when a murderous cult seeks a strongly gifted teenager. It's a race against time and a battle of wills as Dan must accept his gift once more in order to protect young Abra Stone and confront his demons.The casting in this King story is one of the greatest strengths as we get the talents of A-listers Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson and newcomer Kyliegh Curran.
First to focus on our Dan Torrance is the great Ewan McGregor who successfully flits between a traumatized, but still incredibly 'Shining' strong man. When we first meet Dan (post flashbacks) is a disheveled and hungover man that we could mistake for his late father, Jack. Dan abuses the drink just as his father had done previously, but in Dan's case it is to suppress his Shine and the trauma he endured at the age of five. He even thinks of stealing money, but his conscience gets the better of him in the form of his old ally, Dick Halloran. This lost soul wanders round the continental U.S. in order to keep beginning his life anew, but when he settle in New Hampshire, we soon get to see Ewan McGregor transform into a more confident man as we watch him become the titular 'Doctor Sleep' by helping patients in a hospice center. However it is his chemistry with Kyliegh Curran's Abra that makes the heart of the film as McGregor must communicate through writing on a chalkboard and eventually acting as a mentor to young Curran's Abra. He becomes the new Halloran to her Danny, but she is far more confident in their ability compared to Dan's current state. However watching McGregor grow into a fearless hero as the climax approaches is a cathartic journey especially as we watch him confront the trauma he once suffered and is able to redeem himself and protect the world he once shunned.
Newcomer Kyliegh Curran brings an earthliness to the potential victim of the evil True Knot. Abra Stone looks like an average teenager just like meeting little Danny in ""The Shining"", but she is even more powerful in the Shine compared to Dan at the start of the film. She is essentially reckless as a little girl with her power (at the age of five), but when Abra meets Dan and is warned about her powers though is told to stop using the Shine by Dan. However it is due to her ignoring his advice that actually helps her potential mentor open up to using his Shine again and how Dan and Abra are able to battle the True Knot. Abra does suffer terribly in one horrific scene, but throughout the narrative she remains strong and refuses to give in to the fear that the True Knot thrives on. She is afraid like a teenager can be, but Abra doe not let this fear rule her and stands besides Dan unafraid of their adversary.
Finally as the villainess of the piece we have the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson as the wicked Rose the Hat. For a character whose past is virtually unknown to the viewer, Ferguson plays Rose like an ancient evil who has been around for at least half of a century (due to some hints dropped in her dialogue). Rose leads the evil cult, the True Knot, who seek to steal the Shine from young children in order to maintain their life-force. However even though all the members to get have their share of the 'steam', Rose is always the first asserting her alpha female status and keeps the leftover canisters in her trailer to heighten her own selfish nature. Ferguson deftly toes the line of presenting a friendly-ish demeanor (as demonstrated in the opening scene) but quickly turning into a violent and vicious killer without any remorse for killing innocents. The role of Rose being one of the most powerful Shiners demands quite the physical prowess of an actress as she is thrown about psychologically and psychically affected when her members are attacked. Given that Rebecca Ferguson has been part of the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise since 2015, the English actress has the action movie skills that can meet the demand but Ferguson goes even deeper here. She is thin and flexible as she must react to psychological attacks and pantomime being held in place by her powerful adversary, Abra. She and Abra are almost a Holmes-Moriarty in their battle of wits as they work furiously to wear down the other until one gives up, but neither woman is willing to back down.With only one writer in the director, we get a helpful streamlined narrative. Flanagan devotes fair amounts of screen-time to his three leads in order to establish them, but the first act focuses on Dan and his journey to normalcy before the second act introduces him to Abra. We only see him and the True Knot for the first half, but we do get to meet Abra as a little girl when her Shine first surfaces, but she becomes a key player once she hits thirteen and the cult seeks her essence. This is actually for the benefit of the narrative so we can follow Dan first as he establishes his normal life and his friendship with the unseen Abra, keeping him the main focus before it becomes about him, Abra and their battle against the True Knot. Flanagan stays pretty faithful to the novel like he did with ""Gerald's Game"", but does change up moments during the story especially the ending which actually gives closure to Dan and has a cheeky implication if you've seen ""The Shining"".The cinematography and music in the film are also well crafted. The music by the Newton Brothers is quite minimalist similar to Ennio Morricone's score for ""The Thing"" in particular, using a heartbeat prominently in the majority of scenes. There is even use of the classic low brass theme from ""The Shining"" as we reach the climax and the cinematography echoes how Stanley Kubrick filmed the opening to his film. The landscapes are beautifully crafted due to its mainly rural locations in New Hampshire, Iowa and the finale in Colorado and the color contrasts are all unique to their location. We get mostly blue-gray as we follow Dan, green and pink with Abra's room and dying yellow with the True Knot during the daytime and we get darkness at night since the group is evil; Rose's wardrobe even reflects their nighttime evil as Rebecca Ferguson wears mostly gray, tan and her black hat and even a red skirt mixed with some white in one scene. Even the visual effects are decent due to how practical they look particularly in the eerie blue-white glow in the eyes of the True Knot when they perform their wicked ritual. However one thing I wish the visual effects team had done was use digital imposition for the climax when we see Dan confront his childhood trauma; I won't spoil too much of what I'm referring to, but when you see it I think you'll know what I mean.In summary, this is a worthy sequel to one of Stephen King's classic works. It is not perfect of course, but I found it more engaging than the cinematic adaptation of ""The Shining"".",Doctor Sleep
195,martinrobertson300482,Disappointing,4,22 November 2019,"I went into this thinking that it was way to late for a sequel to the Shining. But as long as it did it's own thing (with a few nods and winks here and there) it could be great.The Movie does actually start out that way and I was enjoying it to a point. But it soon goes the easy route and forgets to be it's own movie. Overdoing it with the lazy references and call backs.I was liking Doctor Sleep as a psychological thriller, but when it decides it's now a horror movie it fails miserably, so is unlikely to please many that give it a chance.",Doctor Sleep
196,bhernandez2216,"It's time to Shine, once again",9,8 November 2019,"Stephen King's ""Doctor Sleep"" is one of the best Stephen King's scariest movie of all time. Ewan McGregor played Danny Torrance really good, but Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat, she steals the show as she shines bright, as the greatest iconic supernatural villain of all time.

This one sneeked up on us",Doctor Sleep
198,youngcollind,Pays lip service to it's better half while putting no new quality ideas on the table,3,11 May 2021,"I'll admit that one of the principal problems with this film stems from a similar effect to if I were to randomly declare myself the sequel to Brad Pitt, then watch you keel over laughing as you compare the two of us side by side. However, I'll still maintain that this would be a weak movie were it not for it's ties to the 1980 classic. Rose The Hat is simply a lousy villain, and her ""steam"" stealing clan are basically just vampires, making this portion of the plot feel like a tossed off episode of Buffy. Then, in a half baked effort to reference the original, we're brought back to the Overlook Hotel, which is where things get really tacky. The back half of the movie plays out like some sort of Shinning cosplay, which would be an impressive comic-con display, but is downright embarrassing in this context.",Doctor Sleep
199,meathookcinema,An emotionally mature sequel to a classic,8,2 November 2019,"I read Stephen King's sequel to The Shining and thoroughly enjoyed it when it was first published. I was eager to see the film adaptation and if it was as satisfying as the book.It's always a brave move to write a sequel to a well known book that is now considered to be a classic within it's field. The film is seen as a true classic in the horror genre and is regularly in the Top 10 Horror Movies of All Time polls if not occupying the top spot in a number of instances. So, making a sequel to a film with such a lofty reputation was a brave move.The film starts in Florida in 1980 after the events of the first film and Danny is still haunted and having his life affected negatively by the spectres he saw from The Overlook Hotel which are now haunting and harming him wherever he is. Dick Halloran reappears to Danny to teach him a valuable life less on how to mentally deal with this. I noticed that some of the darker details Dick talked about in the book aren't here. Maybe the film wouldn't have been a 15 certificate if they had been.Taking the plot up again in 1980 is a brave move. It works wonderfully as the plot points that are raised are crucial to the plot. All actors who are filling the shoes of people who have become iconic since the first film's release do a great job. But it's Carl Lumbly (yes, Petrie from Cagney and Lacey!) who is a true revelation here. He is Scatman Crothers reincarnated! It's a performance that is eerily accurate and absolutely amazing to watch. Thankfully, Dick appears throughout the film to give Danny advice in the way as if he were Danny's conscience or inner voice.The film then comes forward to 2011. Danny is an alcoholic. An episode of how chaotic his life is is shown through an incident in bar were he gets drunk, gets into a fight with a fellow bar patron, beats him up and then hooks up with a woman. How chaotic his life is at this point is shown the morning after. We see him waking up next to a woman who has vomited in the bed they slept in, the memories of them doing coke the night before come flooding back and Danny running out on her (after maybe taking money from her to pay her back for her using his money to buy the coke with). Danny is then shown sleeping rough.Danny then makes his way to New Hampshire. Its here that he meets Billy who he instantly feels a bond with. Billy in return sees Danny as having problems and sets out to help Danny address some of his demons- namely, his alcoholism as this is something that Billy has had to face also. Danny starts to go to the Alcoholic Anonymous group with Billy.Whilst this is going on we get introduced to a new group of characters known as The True Knot, a cult led by Rose The Hat. They are a cult whose immortality depends on them feeding off and capturing the 'steam' given off by children who also possess the shining when they are tortured and killed. Yes, Doctor Sleep is extremely dark. The sequence when the baseball player who is only 10 is murdered made for difficult viewing. But I'm glad that the film dealt with issues that were this dark rather than feeling like a lightweight and whimsical quick cash-in.Danny starts working at an old people's home. The resident cat there will instinctively spend time with the resident who is next to die. Danny sees this and so uses his shining to make the resident's departure as painless as possible. He is using his shining again and as a force of good after years of forcing himself to repress and not use his gift.A young girl starts to communicate with Danny using her shining which is shown to be the most powerful example of the power that Danny (and later Rose) has ever experienced. She's only a child but is shown to have shining stronger and more potent than any adult. Abra tells Danny about the 10 year old baseball player who she has visions of being killed. Unfortunately, Rose psychically 'feels' that Abra is watching this murder through her own powers of shining/second sight and this alerts her to Abra's existence. Members of the cult haven't been exposed to any really strong 'steam' for quite some time and cult members have shown to be starting to suffer because of this (we see what happens to members of the cult when this happens during the film as the oldest True Knot member expires into a cloud of steam himself). This makes Abra a target for the group.And that's where I'm going to leave the synopsis. To give any more details away is to ruin the film for everyone!This is a great sequel. References to the past film are subtly placed here and there (one prime example- the overhead shots of cars driving along in the same style as those used by Kubrick in the opening scenes of the original) but they feel relevant and not tacky. If some fans feel that the references are too sparse they should rest assured. The references start to become more frequent as the film progresses. The final act of the movie then takes part at the Overlook Hotel! It would be impossible not to have past references come in thick and fast at this point. And they do and it feels like old friends coming out to play again rather than a desperate attempt to milk some more bucks from a trusted horror classic. Everything that happens at the hotel feels like it's being used in a plot that rightly calls for their use in progressing the story towards it's conclusion.Danny walking through The Overlook and seeing all of the old sites again sent shivers down my spine. There was even a scene that firstly made my jaw drop wide open and then almost reduced me to tears. I'm certainly not going to give it away but it's astounding in it's potency and power.There is plenty going on in the film as you can tell from the plotline. On top of all of this there's even an implied bromance between Danny and Billy which is as intriguing as it's subtle. Intelligent filmmaking is at play here. I predict that the kind of film analysis that was applied to the original film will also be generated from the material that lies within this film.Doctor Sleep is also visually stunning and feels genuinely innovative in some scenes. In fact at some points I thought of the hypnosis scenes from Get Out.Doctor Sleep is a film about addressing the past and confronting demons so that they can be laid to rest and people can progress forward. It's also a film about closure and making peace with your past, the relationships therein and the wounds that until then never seemed to heal.Doctor Sleep is a brilliant film and throughly deserves to be the sequel to such a revered and loved horror classic. And if Ewan McGregor doesn't get a tip of the hat from The Academy then theres something VERY wrong happening.Which makes me think. This years could have nominations for Joaquin Phoenix for The Joker, Zac Efron as Ted Bundy and Ewan McGregor as Danny Torrence. This years Oscars might be good for a change. Carl Lumbly definitely deserves to win plaudits for his extraordinary performance.",Doctor Sleep

201,gabriel_sanchez,"Long ride, first full or lore, then action!",10,5 April 2020,"I haven't read the book; this is a review of the actual movie, without taking into account if it is faithful to the books or not (keep that in mind).Long ride. Had to watch it in two segments, 90 minutes each (the director's cut). If you are not a fan of lore, than it might take a huge toll on you. It reminds me a lot of the first Lord of the Rings movie, though, not that tiresome (don't get me wrong here). So, in the first segment, we are getting along with the lore of this huge mythological universe. Slowly picking up the pace from the events of ""The Shining"" (1980) and improving on our encyclopedia. It's not completely quiet, of course, but most of it is actual lore, setting up for the second segment.I'd say some people would threw this off by now. Like in ""As Above, So Below"" (2014), it builds itself on gathering lore, information, to set the mood for what is to come (and I remember clearly most people in the room hating that). So, again, I'd say some people would just stop watching by the end of the first segment.If you are here up until now, the ride finally begins. The plans is set up, the information needed is acquired; time to execute it! And it was great! I loved everyone's acting and persona. The setting is so dark and eerie all the time. Now, it's not about fear, it's about hunting; and, at last, the movie starts to pick his pace and things get overly interesting. And the finalé is very nice!If you like this kind of lore-movies, with a bunch of fantasy enciclopedia and information, but also good action/thrill, I'd say this is a go; now, if you like things simple and not that complex, where things just happen with basic explanations, maybe skip it.",Doctor Sleep
202,MovieQween-33622,Loved second half but conflicted with beginning...,8,8 February 2020,"The first half of this movie gave me almost a sick feeling. The way this movie started off almost had me turning it off! For those of you who've seen this movie you know exactly what I mean. If you haven't seen this and don't want spoilers please skip ahead.
The way Doctor Sleep started was very confusing. First being introduced to 4 different locations immediately felt like too much. Then after all of the locations, then the most uncomfortable part came. The torture of the children, the extent to what they do to the children and how detailed it is, did not sit well with me. At all! It was too excessive and really was difficult to watch. I don't think they needed to show so much struggle with the children, they could have discussed it and still created a sense of terror.
The second half really picked up and I ended up mostly liking it. I'm a fan of Mike Flanagan, I loved Hush, Geralds Game (also SK book) and Haunting of Hill House. I just thought with him being a dad of several children, maybe he would have cut some of that down. Also the end felt a little rushed with Rosie dying so quickly. For someone so powerful her death felt too quick. I'm feeling a sequel coming on... Overall I did like the cinematography!!",Doctor Sleep

I'm not blaming McGregor/Ferguson, they were alright. The children are bad actors. The direction is pap.This film is what happens when you give an over-excited teenage boy far too much money and says 'See ""The Shining"", fry your synapses in acid, then repurpose everything you feel and have seen in the film.This is a horrifying experience because it made me yawn many times.

206,drunken_munki,Excellent production that respects Kubrick's masteries,9,8 October 2020,"After so many years, and yearning for more to Kubrick's masterpiece 'The Shining' I was so happy to find out that not only Dr. Sleep was in production, but it would follow Kubrick's creation and continue the story of his version of Danny and Jack's memory.This movie snuck into my top top movies and in the end I gave it a very well earned score from me. It is not only beautifully shot, and spans several areas now including creepy forests; beaches, some suburban towns, and of course the return to the Overlook hotel was so excellent.Just taking a beat here to complement the team who made this for respecting the source material and Kubrick's legacy so well. This movie doesn't try to outdo 'The Shining', it just merely accepts that it must compliment it, and they went about it perfectly in my view. The story follows Rose 'The Hat' and her gang of demonically possessed monsters who look like humans, but in reality roam the lands looking for victims to harvest thair essence/shine energy from. This is so creepy and several times turned my stomach watching these psychopathic monsters operate.On the other hand, Dan Torrence is now grown up; milling around and struggling to move on. I love the backstory that unfolds as moments of memories, to help us understand what happened to Danny after the events at the Overlook. In this film however, they are more overt with the happenings and spiritual matters of the demons, ghosts, life after death, etc. Kubrick was very subtle in his works, and here the contrast is noticeable -- but if I'm honest it was well presented in any case.The acting is excellent, and Ewan McGregor is wonderful throughout. A note on Rebecca Ferguson, she is also excellent and absolutely fits this role as not only a creepy and commanding leader, but very beautiful and seductive as her character is said to be. She not only manages the dwindling resources and size of the group, but has to bring more members in.Anyway, the cinematography is on point, and so is the audio and music. There are many throwbacks to the 'This Shining', to give a homage to Kubrick's work and show that really his version of the story is the better one (compared to King's book).Also a note on the representation of Jack Torrence in 'Dr. Sleep', as he is credited to Henry Thomas who is playing the character simply called 'The Bartender'. This was subtle and careful, and I highly respect it. Henry's performance should be applauded, because he didn't try to steal the show, he just stayed in excellent character and the interaction with him and grown up Danny was chilling. Danny, afraid of becoming his father, has to battle the literal demonic energies of the powerful hotel, as well as his alcohol addiction, as a nod to his father from the previous film.This was an excellent piece of work, that pairs handsomely with 'The Shining', and a seriously great job all around. 9/10.",Doctor Sleep
207,Lewis_Heather787,Who knew we needed a sequel? I'm very glad we have it !,8,9 November 2019,"There is always danger with doing a sequel to a much beloved cult classic, especially one that is so ingrained into popular culture and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Needless to say that this sequel has a lot to live up too, I am very happily and surprised to say that ""Doctor Sleep"" is very good, even better than I imagined it would be. Who knows, even Stephen King himself might like this one???I understand reading up about this film that it is based on a book written by King, I will admit that I have not read any books about it at all. I have only watch the films ""The Shining"" and ""Doctor Sleep"" so there is probably a lot I've missed out on or would have like this film to have incorporated. So just based on my familiarity of the source material.........I really really liked this film for many reasons.Firstly the story and the directing by Mike Flanagan, is new and fresh whilst still giving us some great nostalgia with connecting this film to its predecessor. The story for one is a really fascinating one, obviously adapted from the book, but I'm just taking this on face value I have no idea what Flanagan has changed from the book. To me the story has a clear flow to it, the film feels as if it has real purpose, as if there really is an connection to the original and that there is a story to be told. I love the idea of following Danny Torrance all these years later seeing how he has grown up. Whilst still being able to introduce us to all these new characters that feel so grounded into the world these films have created. Its compelling, suspenseful, tense and definitely keeps you guessing. From a directing standpoint I don't think you could have done any better, I love the fact that they re-shot some of the scenes from ""The Shining"". I did also hear that they did use some footage as well from the film, it works both ways.The cast overall is phenomenal however there are two standouts. Firstly Rebecca Ferguson, god she is just so good. Every time she is on screen she steals it, wickedly sexy..........but also incredibly unpredictable which makes her all the more terrifying. A different type of role for her but one that shows her range and that she is extremely good as a ""villain"". The other standout obviously is Ewan McGregor, with probably I'd say the best performance of his career, he seamlessly fits into the role of Danny Torrance. Accent throughout impeccable, he embodies the character so well that you relate to him immediately.........you are desperate for him and ""Abra"" to succeed. You definitely feel for the guy in the early parts of the film.........McGregor shows great arc in the character over the time periods its set in. Stellar work by both of them in particular !!!Now the one area of the film I think will have the most criticism is the final act which takes place at the Overlook Hotel. Now there are some almost direct copies of shots that we see in ""The Shining"". I completely understand why some people might think this is lazy or ripping off that film, however to me it acts as a love letter to the original film. I think the final act is fantastic.............it works for me.The last positive is the pacing..................even though this is a long long film in terms of runtime, the pacing is really good throughout. Its pretty much slow throughout but the film has a really good flow to it, doesn't actually feel as long as it is.Overall this film is very good 85% out of 100, considering the task that this film had to pull off...........pleasing a whole range of fans whilst still being faithful to the source material. I think this film has ticked as many boxes as it could, this is the closest we are going to get to a perfect sequel to ""The Shining"" in my opinion!! I really do wonder if Kubrick were alive today what he would think??? The one small minute fault I have is the fact that the original score from ""The Shining"" doesn't make an appearance, thought it really would have capped of everything in the final act.",Doctor Sleep
208,Dragonsouls,A great horror story that didn't have to be a Shining sequel.,7,20 November 2019,"The first words that came to mind when watching Doctor Sleep was that it was a great horror story that was turned into a Shining sequel. I say this because the the events from the Shining were not serving the plot of the story at all. It kinda felt as if Stephen King wanted to cash in on the success of the Shining and let it propel Doctor Sleep in the sales department.Doctor Sleep was a fantastic story, a tale of spiritual possession and psychic vampirism that Stephen King made into his own. It would have worked without the character of Danny Torrence, or the Overlook. The end of this film didn't have to take place inside the Overlook but it did, but it really didn't have to! I think the story would have been just as good without any connection to the Shining whatsoever.I'm not really complaining here, I'm just wondering if the Shining was used to get more people to read/watch Doctor Sleep at a time when fewer people are reading novels and fewer people are going to the movies. Gripes aside, I thought this film was wonderfully acted and it was overall very creepy. It really did get spine chilling at times and it brought King's vision to the screen in epic fashion, in terms of visual art direction, but no, it does not even come close to what Kubrick did with the first movie even though Doctor Sleep does have some scenes in it that mimic Kubrick's style.King fans and paranormal fans will love this story and Shining fans will as well, as long as you don't expect it to match Kubrick's masterpiece and take it for what it is.",Doctor Sleep
209,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Well it might be shining, but not too brightly.",6,16 May 2020,"I felt rather meh on this. Let me start off by saying I have not read the book so I dont know how it compares. I have of course seen the 1980 ""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick.This film is basically about a cult of evil people who hunt down children and suck the shine (or what they refer to as steam) out of them to essentially stop aging and live forever. Now, Im sure this is probably explained in the books, but its a bit jarring if all you know about the shine from the original movie is that its basically telepathy. And now you have people Mary Poppins style flying into people's minds and having the power to influence others. Its like straight up Charles Xavier's School for gifted youngsters up in here. Not too mention when Rose the Hat (yup thats her name) is ""flying"" into Abra's mind it straight up looked goofy as heck. Also hurting people in their mind's also manifests in the real world....apparently. Also the sucking out of the shine raises questions. I mean....if all you need to do is be in a lot of pain or be very scared or die....then why does none of this happen in the 1980 movie. Of course the real reason is because this story wasnt written then. But, the thing is....I would be totally be fine with this version if events if the film was just being its own thing. But it so clearly wants to be a sequel to the 1980 version. Down to the point where they straight up re-create scenes from that film and use the score.I also feel like the film failed on making Abra likable. I get you're not supposed to root for the villains...but its weird having this young girl smile at the bad guys and tell them how much she hopes they feel pain and what not. I mean she sounds like a future serial killer. I dont think its fault of the actress though. And all in all, I thought the cast was good.I should also note...the film is long....and boy does it feel like it. There are plenty of parts that drag. For instance, I think you could have cut at least ONE of the scenes of Dan with the old men on their death beds. I get its where the title comes from, which is why Im saying at least cut out one. That easily shaves off some time and it doesnt change the plot of the movie in any way. I also think you could cut out the whole recruition of Snakebite Andi. Just have her already be part of a team. If you really need to explain why shes suddenly in the group and not back in 1980...you could easily do some throwaway line like ""We havent blah blah blahed since we recruited Andi in blah"". But again, this would shave down some time and doesnt change the plot in any way.Also the third act decides to literally do The Shining again. Because this movie cant be its own thing, apparently.I mean...the movie isnt totally bad. There are some decent scares and creepy shots and what not. And as I said, I think the cast is good. But like...The Shining it aint.",Doctor Sleep
210,dussaultjulien,"Except for the re-shot scnes from the original, not half bad",7,6 February 2020,"I really don't understand why they thought that they needed to reshoot scenes from the original Shining, But other than that this movie was actually entertaining and surprised me because I didn't know if it was going to be good or not, but I ended up actually liking it in the end.The only truly annoying things were the fact that wherever they shot the Outlook Hotel, was not really the Outlook hotel and the actors and actresses that they chose to use instead of footage from the original Shining for Mr. & Mrs. Torrance looked and sounded nothing like the original actors and actresses.",Doctor Sleep
211,Jared_Andrews,Entertaining and Satisfying Sequel,7,23 November 2019,"""Doctor Sleep"" is the decades-later sequel to the horror classic, ""The Shining,"" set primarily many years after the events at the Outlook Hotel that left young Danny Torrance scarred. Danny (Ewan McGregor) is now an alcoholic adult who battles with inner demons who manifest because of his ""shine."" He also faces real-world demons of sort in the form of vampire-like creatures who steal the souls of children who shine. Dan and a particularly powerful young girl cross paths and team up to battle a group of the creatures, who call themselves the True Knot.In the film's best moments, it really shines (sorry). Mike Flanagan (who has steadily been building his reputation as the most reliable working horror director) performs a challenging dance of honoring both Stanley Kubrick's film and Stephen King's novel sequel. This task becomes all the more difficult when we realize that the follow-up novel paid no mind to the changes between the first book and movie. Certain characters are in different places and key landmarks, like the hotel, faced different fates. Fortunately, Flanagan pulls it off.At times we can also sense a struggle between calling back to the original and pushing forward with a new vision. Fortunately, Flanagan pulls that off too.One scene in particular that displays Flanagan skill and vision features True Knot leader, Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), leaving her body and floating across the country in search of the powerful young girl. I would've enjoyed seeing more moments like this and fewer obvious homages to the original movie. There's plenty to this story to more than stand on its own. The film would have benefitted from further breaking away from ""The Shining.""Blood and violence are kept relatively tame aside from one brutally unsettling scene that gives a sense of how vicious and unfeeling the True Knot group members truly are. Ferguson owns this scene, displaying equal parts menace and alluring charisma. Her performance is the best in the film, with respect to McGregor, who does fine work as well.Ultimately, the film works well thanks to the strong performances and skill of Flanagan, remaining entertaining throughout the lengthy 152-minute runtime.",Doctor Sleep
212,fccs23521,7.5,7,14 December 2019,"I haven't seen the book this is based on, so the film to me is like an homage to Kubrik's The Shining.
At times, this was a 9/10, superbly capturing the feelings of dreams and projection. Especially good was the traveling by the main female character whose every movement I felt exactly. Gorgeously done.
Macgregor has just the tiniest hint of Jack Nicholson in his voice, exactly as a son would pick up his father's inflections and cadence, so subtle. The other characters are perfectly cast, too.
The Shining is one of the all time great horror films imo, and Doctor Sleep is a very good epilogue. I think The Shining fans will appreciate it.",Doctor Sleep

The film could do just as good if not better franchised as its own story. The links, eventually at the end, to the earlier film was a little forced and felt a little like they were clutching at straws to link the two films. Steam and shiners etc.... yup. Locking the original 'ghosts/threats/visions from the first film, in boxes, hmmmm.

219,MickeyTheConstant,Really enjoyable,8,18 May 2020,"I was not suspecting you enjoy this so much. I love King books and often like adaptations of his novels. I s as m a big fan of the 1980s and 90s made gor TV movies and mini series and often feel quite nostalgic when they are on a TV again. I like some of the low budget movies also. Strangely I was never a big fan of The Shining. I do get why people love it and the hotel is proper scary and Nicholson's performance was and still is iconic, I just didn't warm to it or have much affection for it. When I watched Dr Sleep I thought it would just be a rip off of The Shining, with the movie studios just trying to make a few extra bucks. I couldn't be more wrong. I really got into the story, it had a nostalgic feel to it. It kind of created its own universe with the 'shine' greater explained and the introduction of 'steam' and I really enjoyed the gang of scary baddies. It had a feel of a super hero movie at times, people with powers, good vs evil etc. Ferguson was superb as the main evil baddie 'Rosa The Hat' and lit up the screen whenever she was on. McGregor was fine in the lead, not a big fan of his, but he did ok. I just found it all really interesting, more than The Shining ever did for me. At times I felt it would have been better as a tv series and after watching The Outsider recently I stand by that and feel they missed a trick. All in all though a surprisingly enjoyable watch which left me wanting to read the book and hoping they expand the universe so I can find out more about the 'shine'.",Doctor Sleep
220,Slarkshark,Doctor Sleep Shines!,9,3 November 2020,"Not sure why I put this one off for almost a year. It really is too bad it did not do that well box office wise, or get the attention it deserves. I was blown away at how it grabbed my attention so firmly, making the long run time fly by.I'm clearly a fan of the sequels that come decades later, as I can't really think of one I did not enjoy. Usually they're a sequel to an iconic movie, such as this was to 'The Shining'. For that reason, I believe they get special attention because whoever is doing the sequel does not want to mess it up. Mike Flanagan did not screw it up, not one bit. He did an amazing job. It has just the perfect amount of nostalgia, mostly in the third act, but it doesn't rely on it at all. There's a different atmosphere to this one compared to 'The Shining', and that's fine because it can truly stand on its own as its own masterpiece, as a companion to its predecessor; not just something that is trying to be superior or just meet a certain expectation.Ewan McGregor nailed the part as an older Danny Torrance that is finally able to overcome his demons from all those years ago. The young actress, Kyleigh Curran was wonderful as well, and I'm sure will reap some new gigs from her performance. The villains were all despicable, but of course their leader, Rebecca Ferguson was exceptional. I would not have thought she could have pulled off a role that would make me loathe her that much. Very well done, and one of the more interesting villains that I can remember in recent memory.I'm aware that Stephen King is not a fan of Kubrick's film, but I hope he was able to enjoy this adaptation, and even possibly help him appreciate 'The Shining' a bit more.

Hence, it goes without saying that Doctor Sleep is not Shining 2; it is not even in the same league as the horror masterpiece and expectations must be set accordingly. However, this does not stop it from being a terrific film and one of the finest Stephen King adaptations.While The Shining was mostly hints and theories, Doctor Sleep lays out its cards right at the start by showing who the villains are and what they are capable of. The film starts of a bit slow by gradually developing both the protagonists and antagonists until their paths begin to intertwine and this is where it all gets interesting. The dark sequences feel truly harrowing as the actors are able to capture their dementia and project a distressing feeling to the audience thanks to well executed special effects.Doctor Sleep has a constant sensation of negativity hanging in the air putting us in Danny's shoes who has know nothing but pain all his life. The cinematography and music fortify this gloomy atmosphere and give this film its own style instead of simply being a build up to the finale. What slightly stained this movie for me is one unsuccessfully done character and certain moments where it poorly tries to imitate the original instead of being its own film.

I like how Ewan McGregor does the grown up Danny - decades later and a full alcoholic who tries to clean up his life and thereby does the experience that there are more people who have the shining. That's a point I always missed at the first part from Kubrick. It was a little too inconceivable how other people would live with the shining and why they have no club house to do something together. Here some of these questions got answered. I like this movie so much, I rated it 8/10. I would recommend it for people who have seen the Kubrick movie and did like it.

The film's running length is a problem, as it feels like they've crammed too many unnecessary, repetitive scenes; 30 minutes could easily be cut. McGregor and Curran are carrying the film forward with splendid acting and vibrant chemistry, making it easy to overlook the shallowness of the film's main antagonist played by Rebecca Ferguson. The wait for the return of the Overlook Hotel is long but pays off as it is perfectly reconstructed. Also Henry Thomas makes an astonishing impression of Jack Nicholson's Danny Torrence.

234,bastille-852-731547,"A tedious ""Shining"" sequel deficient in real tension and dread",4,9 November 2019,"Almost four decades ago, Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" not only terrorized audiences, but also sparked plenty of unique reflection and analysis on its remarkable use of suspense as both a cinematic device and a tool for fostering character development of its protagonist, Jack Torrance. The film's impeccable attention to detail has also ensured that it is still studied and well-respected today. As a huge fan of the Kubrick film as well as Ewan McGregor, I was really excited for ""Doctor Sleep,"" but unfortunately, I found it to be a huge letdown.The plot of this sequel centers around an adult Danny Torrance (McGregor,) working in a clinic in New England while also trying to deal with a severe drinking problem. He must work to defeat an evil cult called the True Knot, led by ""Rose the Hat,"" after a 12-year-old girl who also has the powers of ""the shining"" gets in its crosshairs. I was never expecting this film to top the genius of Kubrick, but Mike Flanagan seems like a talented director who wanted to really honor the source material, so I was hoping for it to at least try to be meaningful.The first major problem with the film is its tedium. While the pace of ""The Shining"" was slow, it was slow in a great way, as in ""slow-burn to build up maximum suspense and dramatic tension."" On the other hand, ""Doctor Sleep"" just feels tedious. Large stretches of the film pass by with virtually no keyp lot or character development not explored in other scenes, and the film feels repetitive and like it's going nowhere after a while until we get close to the climax. The film also lacks the genuine suspense and tension of the original, since this tediousness impedes on any sense of impending dread. I also feel that the more sprawling narrative of this story as opposed to ""The Shining"" may have been somewhat detrimental to its sense of tension. It also lacks the psychological fear of ""The Shining."" Even though the True Knot and its followers are creepy, attempts to build up a real sense of terror around them generally fall flat. Ewan McGregor tried his best, but his performance is unfortunately rather bland and very limited in range. The only real positive of the movie is that it's fun to see the Overlook Hotel again, but the climax still doesn't feel fully satisfying. Not recommended. 4/10",Doctor Sleep

The Shining,8,29 January 2020,"Although it did not follow the novel, I did not mind: This way Overlook Hotel could be visited again, which gave me goosebumps. The movie is really well made, albeit maybe a tad too long, and the actors are all doing a wonderful job. I would really love to see Rebecca Ferguson as a ""true"" vampire with long fangs and, preferably, a very skimpy outfit. It also dawned on me that Ewan McGregor would be perfect in a werewolf role..And thanks for the music in the end.",Doctor Sleep
239,dopefishie,Mixed bag,7,8 May 2021,"Tonally, the beginning is uneven. In this way, it follows the book which feels more like an adventure story than a horror story. However, half-way through, it takes a detour and paves its own path forward in a distinctly more horrific way than the book. Some of the deviations and additions work really well, and I was happier with the changes than I thought I'd be! However, it spends too much time revisiting the Overlook in a manner that doesn't serve the plot. They didn't have to slowly take us through every room - it was too much fan service. So, it was an odd mix of retreading old stuff with a mix of some new ideas that often worked. Definitely worth seeing.",Doctor Sleep

Following up on the Shining is hard and to be totally honest, I am not sure that this movie needed to tie into the Shining. It could have stood on its own but I suppose tying it into a famous film increased ticket sales so it was likely a business decision.Acting was good. Characters were well played albeit the villains were sort of a yawn and might have needed more background. I like the addition of Abra to the story and although she was a bit over the top, it was fairly satisfying to watch things unfold. I liked the way the old story was woven in completely demolish the original lore and they added just enough to make me want to see more.The bad... unfortunately the premise of this film takes us in a direction that is pretty far separated from the original. This is why I said it would be fine as a stand alone film because honestly, the connection was contrived. Not that it was bad, but it does change the tone of the original in some ways.

I didn't understand what was the use of the witch's followers? They had no powers except for that one pusher, and they died so stupidly. Matter of fact, they all died stupidly without much thought.

244,theredsky,Doctor Sleep Review,4,13 November 2019,"The Stanley Kubrick version of The Shining is awesome. They had so much potential to make a sequel to The Shining and they executed it like this. It was a huge disappointment for me. This movie does have a talented cast but they are put into such a disappointing movie. I thought that Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson did a great job and bring some enjoyment to this film but their characters are incredibly weak. I don't how it was possible to make an already existing and developed character weak but they did that to Danny Torrance in this movie. His only character trait is that he wants to help people but that's it. Rebecca Ferguson's character is pretty weak too. Her only motivation is that she wants to live for a while which is fine but she has no character to back it up. Although, there are sequences with her character that are visually interesting and peaked my interest a little bit. I thought the story was fine I guess. I have never read the Doctor Sleep novel so I can't say whether it was faithful or not. The 3rd act was dreadful though. All it was was hey do you remember how great The Shining was over and over again. It recreated a bunch of scenes from the original and somehow managed to make them worse. It's solely relying on if you remember The Shining or not instead of being interesting. There are only two aspects of the 3rd act I appreciated. I thought that the score rendition of The Shining theme was good albeit not as iconic as the original theme and there is a Jack Nicholson look alike that does a pretty good job at looking and sounding like Jack Nicholson. I can't say that for all of the look alikes though. Instead of finding people who looked like Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd, they just completely recast them and it's terrible. Doctor Sleep is 2 and a half hours long and it does not deserve that runtime. They should have just cut it down to just about 2 hours. The added time just makes parts of the film flat out boring. There are some other technical aspects that I thought were bad. There is this stupid heartbeat sound effect they use at least 30-40 times throughout the film and it is incredibly annoying and some of the visuals later in the film looked pretty bad. Overall, Doctor Sleep may have some good performances but it's over reliance on being related to The Shining, being much longer than it should, and weak characters make this one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me.",Doctor Sleep

251,jacksisjax,sleepy doctor,8,8 August 2020,"Yeah I liked this movie quite a bit, it was rather entrancing. It was very engaging the entire movie. It was cosmic, mend bending and hypnotic. Really had you keyed in from beginning to end.I read the shining book and watched the movie and have loved them both. I started to read Doctor Sleep and stopped because it was unnecessarily sexual... one of Stephen Kings major faults. I kind of wish that I had finished the book though because it seems to me like it would have rounded out some rather questionable plot points in this movie.I think this movie was STELLAR on many accounts. Awesome crisp feel to it, amazing performances, very cool cinematography, and it just has an awesome creative story going for it. Like Stephen king or not, the guy is an amazing storyteller. Where this movie didn't ""shine"" (no pun intended) is the script. The dialogue is rather lacking often, and not enough backstory is given for certain events. For example; I really have a hard time understanding why they even needed to go to the overlook hotel. Why lead her there when it seemed rather easy to kill her friends? Some pivotal plot points like this are a weee lacking in information, which is why I wish I read the book, so I could have better understood these things.
I also feel that the scenes in the hotel were rather try hard. They tried to hard to connect to the shining. Trying to bring back that original vibe. Which is a HARD thing to do considering nobody has that subtle creepy Kubrick touch. This movie just wasn't in the place for call backs to that kind of horror. I still enjoyed it, but it lacked the ""nostalgia"" that they were going from from the original film.

256,paulijcalderon,Surprisingly a neat little companion piece to the classic! That doesn't just rely on nostalgia to tell their story,8,1 November 2019,"What a surprise... That wasn't so bad actually! Now, hear me out. When I first saw the previews for this I felt disappointed by the visual look of the film, as it was all too green-tinted and lacked the Kubrick-esque framing I want from a film like this (it being a sequel to ""The Shining"" after all). Remember, I care too much about the visual aesthetics of these things sometimes. Especially when it was clearly supposed to connect right to the iconic classic. The green tint stays throughout the film, much to my displeasure. Worked great in ""Joker"" though. But once I got what the story was and paid attention I realized I was getting invested. This is a different type of film while still remembering to pay huge amounts of respect to the legacy of the original. Once you do get to the elements that carry over from Kubrick's film it felt well earned. Interestingly enough they kind of blend well together too eventually. We delve into the supernatural aspects of what Stephen King was going after in his book, and that's completely fine. I don't mind a chilling spookie once in a while. Recently I've felt done with most of the modern day horror film tropes, so it's such a shock for me to say that I had a good time with ""Doctor Sleep"".The progression of where Danny Torrance's character goes to is a natural right step. They go for the 'father like son' kind of thing, and I was completely onboard with it. The ghost of Jack Nicholson's presence looms strongly over the story too, with Danny fearing not to follow his father's footsteps. The new story elements were able to grab my attention as well. Again, as soon as it clicked what type of plot/movie this was, then it worked. It's its own thing, and that's great. No ""Shining"" remake - except for some re-created imagery (handled with nice respect) - But most importantly: The story and characters moved forwards. Loved what they did with the character Rose the Hat. What a sinister yet oddly charming antagonist portrayed hypnotically by Rebecca Ferguson. Hope she gets the deserved credit. Ewan McGregor will always be Obi-Wan to me, but he was a fantastic choice to play Danny. He can convincingly make me believe that he's got the 'shine'. It surprises me how positive I feel about the movie! It's a neat little companion piece to the classic. Again, big props for them to go for their own thing. This is no ""Force Awakens"", if you know what I mean. You'll walk though memory lane here for sure. The difference is that it doesn't rely on the nostalgia to tell their story. It actually stands on its own. I'll say that if you're a big fan of the original, then it's worth taking a looksie",Doctor Sleep
257,rcolgan,All talk and no scares makes Doctor Sleep a dull film,5,4 November 2019,"Stanley Kurbrick's The Shining is my all time favourite horror movie. Through a mixture of Kurbrick's meticulous attention to detail and the films haunting score, it had this feeling of constant dread that loomed over every scene. Across the film it builds up the history and mythology of Overlook hotel in a way that constantly made us raise questions, but without ever offering us any clear answers. Instead it condensed this history into a story of spousal abuse and combined it with some iconic performances from Nicholson and Duvall to achieve the ideal of what all horror films should strive to achieve.Needless to say this sets a high bar for any film to live up to. But with King himself writing his own sequel novel in 2013 and the current trend for studios to cash in on as many nostalgic properties as they can, it was only a matter of time before Doctor Sleep got made into a film. We now get a loose adaptation of King's novel following a grown up Danny Torrance after the events of the first film (and not the vastly different book) as he attempts to deal with his dark past and the horrors of the supernatural world.It's a pretty strong setup for a continuation and at first the film seems to do a decent job at exploring this potential. We see a washed up Danny trapped in a bottle and struggling with the ghosts of the Overlook hotel in a precariously similar situation to his own father. This aspect of the film is definitely elevated by McGreggors performance who really channels his own history with alcoholism in a way where you can see how worn down he's become through a constant battle with his inner demons.But unfortunately we don't get to explore this side of Danny in too much detail, as just when Danny appears to be getting his life back on track a girl who also has the ability to shine named Abra, played by Kyliegh Curran, approaches him. She needs help dealing with a cult known as the true knot. They're an ancient organisation who preys on ""gifted"" children to absorb their life in an attempt to gain immortality and are led by a woman named Rose, played by Rebecca Ferguson, who takes sinister joy in creating fear and pain for the young children she kidnaps since she says that it makes them taste better.Though whilst Ferguson's performance is entertaining, the surrounding history doesn't carry the same weight as that of the Overlook hotel. You would expect that the idea of these characters who have lived potentially millenia would carry some interesting backstories, but there's little depth with most members of the group hardly even getting any dialogue.They also end up being taken care off so easily that it left me wondering why they should have ever been considered a threat to begin with. And it's a big problem when the monsters of a horror film are neither scary nor interesting.Also whilst the idea of Danny mentoring a young girl just like dick Hallorann did for him seems like it could be interesting, they seem to waste this potential since the girl never seems to need his help. Unlike Danny she doesn't seem detached from the world due to her powers and she's already seems more powerful than Danny so we don't see this dynamic explored.Then of course there's the return of the Overlook hotel which was teased ever since the first teaser. The original Shining didn't try to rely on jump scares alone to create the Overlooks terrifying presence, instead it slowly built up the structure of the hotel through tracking shots and a dreadful sense of complete isolation. Then when it got to the end with all the spirits revealing themselves it's a hectic explosion of chaos delivering on some horrifying imagery. But here the hotel is just treated like a fun house only appearing in the last act of the film and having appearances of all the spirits crammed into the film without ever delivering on any actual scares.Unfortunately the only element in the film which really comes close The Shining is the films score, which does a decent job of capturing the tone of the original theme. But outside of this the film just ends up feeling too scattered to be effective. There's not enough suspense to make for a good horror and there's not enough depth to provide us with a good character study. And in terms of capturing the spirit of the original film, unfortunately Ready Player One ended up being the more loyal portrayal.",Doctor Sleep

263,just_in_case,"Condensed, but solid. (directors cut)",7,26 January 2020,"Doctor Sleep, book and film is weird because its a sequel to the shining story but not the tone. Stephen King disliked the original movie and I suspect its largely because the book was mostly about alcoholism not focused on horror. So his sequel book is about dannys descent into alcoholism and redemption as a child of an alcoholic. If you're expecting horror you're going to be at least mildly disappointed. This is pretty strictly a long form supernatural thriller/drama. That said I enjoyed it. Its very entertaining for the very long run time. I recommend ignoring the theatrical release. I've only seen the directors cut which is almost 30 minutes longer and I still felt like it was missing some important plotpoints from the book. They could have spent more time expanding on Dannys youth and what led to him following in his Dads footsteps.This isn't a spoiler, if you've read the book or followed the synopsis, the movie jumps multiple times after something like 30 years.

267,BeanieCore,Another masterpiece from Flanagan; a film that will satisfy devotees of both the novel and the Kubrick adaptation.,9,25 November 2020,"I'm not at all a fan of ""The Shining"", so one may ask why I'm bothering to watch what basically amounts to it's sequel. The answer is Mike Flanagan. I've been following Flanagan's career since his debut film, ""Absentia"", and he has remained my favorite horror director of this decade, and one whose imagination and skill is seemingly endless. I'll watch anything this man puts out, and this film was to be no exception. And just like any of his other films, this one was well worth the watch. It works as both a homage to the Kubrick film, and to the King novel. Thusly, it will satisfy both those who preferred either the film or book version. A knowledge of the prior film is not needed, although it greatly helps to magnify one's appreciation of the story and the scenes that Flanagan so lovingly recreates.Meanwhile, the story of a full grown Danny Torrance coming to terms with his psychic abilities and fighting a band of soul sucking vampires also works wonderfully. Ewan McGregor is as good as expected in the lead role, but Rebecca Ferguson and young Kyleigh Curran steal the screen. Ferguson is fiendish and stylish as the main villain and is a pure joy to watch and Curran shows great depth and range for such a young actress. The film doesn't always work as a straight forward horror picture, containing elements of fantasy as much as anything else, but when the film does kick into the horror bits, it doesn't hold back. And the end is an especially stunning tribute to the source material, focusing at once on the visuals of Kubrick's film and the complex emotional core of King's novel, and felt epic to me, even as someone who isn't a fan of the 1980 film. It's a strange film, and one that almost feels like it shouldn't work as well as it does, but I'll be damned if it isn't incredibly creative, full of heart and exceptionally directed.

It's just different.Cast is great and Ewan McGregor plays the role of recovering alcoholic transforming into regular citizen and then into a hero fairly well. Cliff Curtis helps greatly well with all aspects of the character.I don't particularly like the ending, seemed a bit underwhelming after the build up.There seems to be a room for part 3, but there's no novel by King.

This just goes to show that Mike Flanagan was the best choice to adapt the sequel to The Shining.
Although I've read Doctor Sleep, I've forgotten parts of it, but the things I remember, Flanagan brought them all to life in this masterful adaptation. It's a long movie, but it's never boring or too long. His screenplay and directing are basically flawless, which makes him one of the best modern horror directors.

Expanding the fantastic world of The Shining and adding new characters and myths to the inner universe of the film, he manages to create a dreamy and brilliant world full of mystery and brutality. Dr. Sleep manages to create his own story without having to rely too much on the original. It's an entertaining film with excellent scenes and an intriguingly bloody story.

West of Iowa, Danny Torrance(Danny Lloyd) meets the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers), who takes this scared boy under his wing, giving the supernatural power he is cursed with, a name. ""Doctor Sleep"", directed by Mike Flanagan, the follow-up to ""The Shining"", opens with a child murder near a Floridian lake concurrent to Danny's timeline. ""Doctor Sleep"" explains a lot, much like how Peter Hyams' ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" took the mystery out of the monoliths from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", also directed by Kubrick, when the audience learns, retrospectively, that the ghosts bedeviled Danny Lloyd from yesteryear because he was full of ""steam"", food to sustain the dead, a comestible called ""soul"". People with the shining are soul food. While Danny and his mother Wendy(Shelly Duvall) were running for their lives from an ax-wielding maniac, husband/father Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson), Violet(Violet McGraw) was being devoured by The True Knot, a vampire cult led by Rose the Hat(Rebecca Ferguson). The little girl not only provided cover for Danny Lloyd, but in an extra-diegetic sense, she protected Ray Kinsella, as well. Imagine the steam in that farmer. Not only does he bring ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson(Ray Liotta) back from the great beyond, but all of the disgraced Chicago White Sox players, sentenced to lifetime bans after being charged with throwing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, an incident which was dubbed the Black Sox Scandal. Most importantly, in Phil Alden Robinson's ""Field of Dreams"", Ray, much like Danny Lloyd(Ewan McGregor) as an adult, has unresolved issues with his father, John Kinsella, a failed baseball player, whom the son was often at odds with as a teen and adult to the bitter end. Ray shines so hard, he resurrects his father, the minor league farmhand who finally gets called up to the majors. Iowa is heaven for John Kinsella(Dwier Brown). It's a post-mortem baseball fantasy camp of sorts. For Terrence Mann(James Earl Jones), a retired writer, who returns to the Hawkeye State with Ray after he shares this possessed man's vision, Iowa is heaven on earth; pure fiction. The counterculture hero-turned-recluse saw the career stats of Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham on the Fenway Park scoreboard; one game, no at-bats. He became Dr. Graham(Burt Lancaster), a general practitioner in Minnesota. En route to Iowa, Ray picks up a hitchhiker, the doctor as a young man, Archie(Frank Whaley), another benevolent ghost, but nevertheless, another dead person he had the power to reanimate.Iowa is a field of nightmares for Bradley Trevor(Jacob Tremblay), a Little League slugger who steals interior confirmations from the pitcher, not outward signals that the catcher lays down with splayed fingers. Bradley has the shining, too, not eyes in the back of his head. Barry the Chunk(Robert Longstreet) scouts the midwestern ""hayseed"", but he's neither a representative from some prep school or college; he's a Rose the Hat surrogate, a scout for The True Knot, here to kidnap, murder, and feed on the boy's soul with the rest of his undead team. The (un)natural lives up to the hype. First pitch swinging, Bradley's stroke delivers the ball over the center-field wall, and then some. He's ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson as a boy. Unlike Ray Kinsella, the voice in Danny's head is no enigma; it's known from the outset, a teenage girl named Abra Stone(Kyliegh Curran), a Generation Z shiner, who tells Danny Lloyd, a recovering alcoholic, that in Iowa, a field of nightmares, a decomposing body is available for digging at a makeshift grave near an abandoned ethanol plant. Danny makes the road trip with Billy Freeman(Cliff Curtis), his AA sponsor(along for the ride like Terrance Mann), a man of science who somehow intuits that the man behind the wheel is no charlatan. Abra saw it all. Rose, the looker, isn't accustomed to being looked at; she turned around, sensing Abra, a witness to the ritual murder, while the other cultists inhale the young baseball player's soul like pigs at a troth. ""Doctor Sleep"", a forerunner to Leigh Whannell's ""The Invisible Man"", translates technology into an insentient language. ""Murder,"" Abra writes telekinetically on a chalkboard that doubles as a wall in the New Hampshire loft where Danny and the girl had established their intermittent communique throughout her girlhood. The chalkboard acts as a computer screen whose words take on the form of primitive text messages with each person writing something brief and ephemeral. Abra is the embodiment of every computer user who wishes they had the ability to fight back. Rose the Hat is the computer. Abra has strength, unlike Cecilia Kass(Elisabeth Moss), bullied by surveillance, at the outset of ""The Invisible Man"", who is stricken with the fear of being found, when she uses liquid paper to block the camera eye in her laptop. Adrian Griffin(Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is Cecilia's own Rose the Hat, a coded manifestation of Silicon Valley, a high-tech peeping tom. Rose uses astral projection; her hologram scouring earth for Abra Stone's whereabouts from outer space. Whereas Adrian, metaphorically speaking, is a ghost in the machine who escaped into the corporeal world, Rose the Hat is that human icon in Google Maps come to life, when she touches ground on Abra's street and home residence. Inside the girl's house, the eternal woman acts as a data broker, going through folders containing personal information stored in filing cabinets, an abstraction of a brain. ""My mind is a cathedral,"" Rose brags, just before Abra turns the tables and enters the data broker's head, the church of a poisoned consciousness, stealing information in return; it's the revenge fantasy of every vulnerable person who has ever gone online. Abra speed-reads what looks to be entries in a card catalog. It's the right metaphor; we're analog, after all; we're libraries. A library, in ""Field of Dreams"", set well-before The Information Age is an edifice; literal, real world, a town called Chisholm, the place where Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham died in 1972. Ray's shining is like a typewriter. The ghost in his backseat, the end-products of keys from a Smith-Corona striking paper. Ray Kinsella, in a sense, wrote the baseball field by electromechanical means.The Overlook Hotel that the filmmaker uses is wholly lifted from ""The Shining"". Danny Torrance roams the corridors of his old haunts, uncannily looking like a cipher in Stanley Kubrick's virtual reality. Dick Halloran(Carl Lumbly), the former caretaker, had described to Danny the ghosts as nothing more than ""pictures in a book"", which the boy neutralized, one after another over the intervening years, just like somebody who achieved mastery over a video game. ""Doctor Sleep"" owes a debt to the William Gibson novel ""Neuromancer"", because it reconfigures the Overlook Hotel as cyberspace, whereas ""The Invisible Man"" tweaks the horror trope of devil(or ghost) possession by making the antagonist invisible. ""Doctor Sleep"" turns into a sort of computer game, in which the objective is to bring Jack, his father, back from the dead for a long overdue reconciliation; a catharsis. The game begins when Danny takes a seat at the bar, the same stool where Jack Torrance sat in the Kubrick film. For years, Danny's supposition about his father's attempt to murder the family was due to alcoholism. Jack, five months sober before their Colorado relocation, simply went off the wagon, aided by the ghost of a historical caretaker, inflicted with cabin fever. Deep down inside, Jack loved his wife and son. A recovering dipsomaniac himself, the bartender serves Danny a shot of whiskey. The bartender identified himself as Lloyd(Joe Turkel), when he poured for his father, and in ""Doctor Sleep"", Lloyd it is, still, but he has Jack Torrance's face. The son, not wanting the spell to break, makes allowances for his father's transparent disguise as the Overlook Hotel bartender, before he uses direct address. The reunion is not dissimilar to Ray Kinsella, in ""Field of Dreams"", when his father materializes in Iowa as a catcher. Instead of a ""wanna have a catch"" moment once the two men acknowledge their familial relationship, Jack tells his son the horrible truth; how the responsibilities of being a family man drove him to drink, a nightmare, aggravated by writer's block. What goes unsaid in ""Field of Dreams"" is the reality of lowered expectations; the framework that entrapped father and son. John Kinsella, had he made it as a big leaguer, would have a different and better life. Ray is his child, by default. As a teen, Ray stopped playing organized baseball after reading Terrence Mann's book, ""The Boat Rocker"", realizing, perhaps, that John loved the game more than him; loving him only when he donned the pinstripes. In this case, the shining game ends in a tie; a win-win. The son helps John realize his dream of being a professional baseball player, and in return, the father never tells Ray that living a second-rate life was a nightmare.The son wins, the father loses in ""Doctor Sleep"". He defeats not only the ghosts in the machine, but the machine itself, including Rose the Hat, an extension of the machine, like how Cecilia overcomes Adrian's persistence of vision.Danny Torrance, in essence, burns down the Internet.""Doctor Sleep"" imagines the possibility of a girl like Abra Moore, a modern-day teenager, living a more organic life, free from the tyranny of Silicon Valley.",Doctor Sleep
273,TerribleKatherine,You should watch this,8,27 June 2021,"I am a King fan but never been particularly a Shining fan, so I was hesitant to watch this, but damn did I enjoy this movie a lot. The cast, including the kids, was great. Ewan McGregor never disappoints me. The plot was simple but interesting and entertaining and there was actual gore, which was pleasant surprise. Wow, I have enjoyed Mike Flanagan's previous work and yet again he delivers. Also, oh my god did they do amazing job recreating the original hotel and casting ""the original family"".",Doctor Sleep
274,mitchell5954,A Worthy Sequel To A Horror Classic,9,17 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is the long awaited adaptation of the sequel novel to The Shining by Stephen King, as well as the movie sequel to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Does this film live up to that hype? For the most part yes. Is it as good as Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece? No. It was never going to be. The Shining is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It's a horror classic. However, this is a certainly a worthy sequel.Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is one of my favorite horror movies ever. However, it was also a film I didn't like when I first saw it. The film terrified me as a kid; so much so that I avoided the film for years upon years until I saw it again recently. When I saw it again, now an adult, I love it. It really is a film you need to watch multiple times to appreciate it.I think it was a wise decision to make this a sequel to Kubrick's film, despite having to change things from the original novel. I haven't read the book. I started it, but never finished. However, I know the book is quite different from the movie, especially the ending. As such this movie, as a sequel to that, I'm sure takes some liberties with the source material, especially in the third act. The director could've easily made this a direct adaptation and have it be a sequel to the miniseries. But it was smarter the way he did it, as most people are familiar with Kubrick's film, and it's a much more highly acclaimed piece. I'm not a fan of the miniseries at all. I know it's more in line with the book, but I found it very boring, silly, not scary or atmospheric, and with horrible effects.However, I also like that this isn't a straightforward sequel to the Shining. Up until the third act this film is a completely different story with the same lead character. The film is about Danny facing his demons and finally putting them to rest, quite literally in the third act. You also have these people, essentially soul vampires, hunting down people with shining abilities and killing them. They don't go too in-depth with them but give you just enough information for you to know what they're all about.I liked how this film delved much more into the shining itself. Despite being called the Shining, neither the film nor miniseries really delved into the shining ability that much. It focused much more on the hotel and jack going insane. This film actually revolves around shining and people who have it.The film looks great. It has a good atmosphere to it, and is well directed. All the actors do a great job, especially Ewan McGregor. I think this might now be my favorite performance of his. I've always known him as Obi Wan from Star Wars, and always will, but this might be his best role to date. The music is great. I will say when I heard the classic Shining theme in the third act I got excited. It was playing on nostalgia in the right way.If there's a weakest link in this film it would be the last third. I get why they did it like that. It was a fitting end to Danny's character arc, and they wanted to recapture some of the essence of Kubrick's movie for the fans. They also wanted to give complete closure to the hotel story. The director tried to do three things at once in this film. He tried to make an adaptation of King's novel, a sequel to Kubrick's classic film, and do a close adaptation of the ending of the novel. For the most part he pulled it off.I'm not saying the third act is bad by any stretch. It was just the least interesting bit for me. What I liked about the first two-thirds of the film is that it felt like a totally different experience, and not simply retreading and trying to recapture what made the first film great again.Overall, Doctor Sleep is a great sequel to the Shining. It has great acting, great atmosphere, great suspense, and a great story. It has a great first and second act, with a solid, but weaker third act. As an adaptation I don't know how this fares, but as a standalone movie it's one of the best Stephen King films thus far.",Doctor Sleep
275,Matin_Shwany,Worth The Time!,8,11 March 2020,"Doctor Sleep gives life back to the 1980 original movie, at the same time both movies are different from each other but they have things in common, i don't know if this is the best sequel for the shining movie but what can we do it's based on the novel by (Stephen King), i am gald that i have watched the director's cut (3 hour) version as long as the movie is but it doesn't disappoint you even if it's bad to you, i didn't care how long the movie was i just wanted to be with it and have a look back into the (Overlook Hotel), at first i was just thinking Where does this movie want to take me? Is it gonna shock me? No Is something surprising gonna be revealed? No, Well i didn't find anything horrific in it but i like it how they made it as a Fantasy/Horror, i was relieved when ever we had flashbacks to the old one, everything is good in this movie but the story isn't a big deal, i enjoyed this movie to fullest i forgot what the word boring is, (Ewan McGregor) and (Rebecca Ferguson) are shining for their roles i was also surprised to see (Cliff Curtis) in it, Fun fact: 1- throughout the movie being 3 hours long i paused the movie for 15 seconds 2- i was sticked to my place just stood one time at the beginning, in total this is worth it if you were a fan of the first one, highly recommended 7.5/10⭐",Doctor Sleep
276,Derache,This was not a sequel.,5,16 November 2019,"This movie introduces itself as a sequel to the shining, but the truth is, that this movie is not. It does carry characters and sometimes the setting, but the whole movies plot, universal laws, tone and theme does not at all match the original. Do not go into it expecting it to resemble a sequel. If you put the fact that it is basically a stand-alone movie, the movie was at best a 5/10. The actors in the movie were not amazing, especially the kid and the shining group, which really just took away from my immersion into the movie. The script writing did not help this either, a lot of the time it seemed so useless. An example would be that they often went into these long winded conversations that were set up to seem like they connect with reality, but they're only purpose is to progress the movie. The camera work was mediocre, nothing special. The cgi was okay, but often distracted me from the movie and took away from my immersion. The plot itself seemed pretty useless, there was no developed internal conflicts, the closest we got was dan's drinking problem, but even that was weak. This movie felt like nothing more than some weak supernatural horror movie but without jump-scares or suspense. It was painfully mediocre, I am
Being very generous with a 5/10, I would recommend anyone to not watch it if they can.",Doctor Sleep
277,ccamp89,Weak 1.5 // Side Show,3,22 November 2019,"Listen. I wasn't expecting Doctor Sleep to approach Kubrick's towering horror masterpiece. But what I also didn't expect was the film would manage to fall far, far below my severely tempered expectations. Having been a fan of Gerald's Game though unconvinced by the Netflix series The Haunting of Hill House, I was curious to see what Mike Flanagan could accomplish with this adaptation. The novel is no masterpiece and the tone strays significantly from King's original The Shining, but it's a solid enough story that could certainly have made for a compelling film with the right direction.Unfortunately, as with The Haunting of Hill House, the direction seems to be the weak link as this film is plagued with a similar sense of dullness and inertia. Simply put, the film just plain fails at generating compelling and visceral sequences so crucial to a good horror film. It does have its moments, particularly the ""baseball boy"" scene, but so much of the film is populated with flatly-lensed, stilted dialogue sequences that kill any developing momentum. The script calls attention to itself far too frequently, perhaps most hilariously at the atrocious climax where our main villain and protagonist threaten to make each other scream in a manner befitting of a hammy C action movie. And the stilted dialogue and flat execution severely hinder investment in the characters who ultimately come off as underdeveloped and nebulous, the only exception being Rose who at least has a personality despite her non-threatening goofiness.The thing that drags Doctor Sleep down from being an uninspired horror film to borderline offensive, though, is the absolutely shameless capitalization on the iconic imagery of Kubrick's film. The final act of the story has been completely re-written from the novel, and the purpose couldn't be more crystal clear: show us all the things we remember from the original film! It's so blatant that the film's narrative comes to a screeching halt so that adult Danny can slowly walk around the Overlook Hotel fun house to give the audience a chance to look at the things we've all seen before. The rich subtext, surrealism, and ambiguity of the original film is reduced to what feels like a cheap side show attraction where you pay a nickle to see some mannequins jut out at you via air-compressed pistons. It feels like a mockery, and King (who famously despises the original film) appears to have been heavily involved in constructing the ending which retcons Kubrick's haunting modifications into something similar to his somewhat overblown and cheesy final act of the original novel.I probably sound more angry than I really am. At the end of the day, the legacy of Kubrick's film will live on unscathed, leaving Doctor Sleep to function as a disconnected diversion for the straight-to-Netflix crowd. Or at least that's what I'll keep telling myself.",Doctor Sleep

Different story shot in a different way and i like that it try not to copy Stanley and be it's own thing. I'm a massive Shining fan and i loved the little callbacks to the first movie they were quick fun aha! i remember that! moments but nothing too intrusive to the story.

The only thing I didn't like about the film were the actors who would ""replace"" Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, I didn't buy a word they said and I thought they were horrible.Rebecca Fergurson is amazing as the villain, and I think it's her best role since the Mission Impossible saga. Ewan McGregor was also very good, but I think Kyliegh Curran steals the show with his incredible performance as Abra Stone. The other vampire cult actors were good, but there is not much more to say, there are references to Kubrick that were excellent and others that were not.But in conclusion this is a good film with great cast and worth seeing to conclude with The Shining (1980) by Stanley Kubrick.",Doctor Sleep

285,Benslie,A good sequel to The Shining,8,10 November 2019,"First of all, the editing in this film is just weird in the first half of it. I get it the movie has to tell three different stories but it would jump to the next scene so awkwardly. There were some really cool shots in this film that I wish I could talk about but trust me when I saw there are some shots that are brilliant in how they look. Now, the acting in this film was good from everybody and there was really only one-person who slightly blew me away and that was Ewan McGregor. He took everybody on a journey with this character. From the beginning of the film to the end you always feel bad for Dan and just want the best for him. Kyliegh Curran, I can see her doing great work in the future. Rebecca Ferguson did an okay job as Rose the hat but she doesn't really become a standout until the end of the movie. The pacing in this film is definitely slow in the beginning and picks up the pace towards the end. I have to applaud the set designers for what they did to the Overlook Hotel. The musical score, done by the Newton Brothers, may not be as iconic as the original movie but you can hear elements from that movie. In the end, this movie is a good sequel to The Shining but if you want to watch this movie, I would recommend not watching the trailer because, in my opinion, it gave away a lot of the good parts of this movie.

Abra through her evanescent abilities tracks down a terrifying cult by the name of True Knot, whose gang is responsible for tracking, hunting, and eating shines, killing the host. The group has been at it for hundreds a years who use their unsuspecting appearances to prey on the innocent and most times the targets are young children proving to me the most despicable part. Using Abra's seemingly super-powered abilities and Dan's knowledge of eradicating benevolent beings the two join forces heading to where it all started, The Overlook Hotel, reigniting the demons Dan fought so hard to escape his whole life in an attempt to free Abra from a life of torment, the life he lived. The battle of Good vs. evil set on a grand stage for an unforgettable finish.An amazing tribute to one of the greatest horror films of all time, The Shining(1980). Showing plenty of nods to the original, this is continuing the story while also injecting enough original ideas to make this film still it's own. We see some standout performances in this one and several terrific sequences, the run time is long but once you get pulled in it the length is unnoticeable, every scene and moment is not for nothing and usually captivating in it's own right. This is one of the few sequels that really has enough originality you can enjoy knowing nothing of the first film but also plenty of flashbacks that help you understand some events from the original that tie into the sequel. Having the immense challenge of being an effective sequel to Stephen King's novel and an effective sequel to Stanley Kubrick's adaptation, a test Doctor Sleep passed with flying colors!

292,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A Solid Follow-up To The Shining. A Supernatural Thriller With a Beating Heart.,8,17 September 2020,"Following the events after The Shining, a now-adult Danny Torrance, traumatized from what happened at the Overlook Hotel and the burden of his abilities, has resorted to alcoholism. He moves in a small town to start life anew, working at a hospice where he comforts dying patients, earning him the nickname ""Doctor Sleep"".Through a telepathic connection, Danny befriends a teenage girl named Abra Stone, who possesses shine abilities that outshine his own. Abra is targeted by The True Knot, an immortal cult that preys on the dying breath of people (called ""steam"") with shine abilities for eternal life. Abra's endangerment forces Danny out of hiding to protect her from the True Knot.Director Mike Flanagan worked up the ranks first as a video editor and it is evident here. At 152 minutes, Doctor Sleep is one for the long haul but it is incredibly well-paced. Stories in films do not unfold anymore like they used to. These days when A is happening and before it resolves, B cuts in and further kicks things into action. The plotting in Aquaman comes to mind as a major example.The story unfolding gave the film a sense of grandeur which made it feel like a proper movie that was confident with how it used its sweet time. There are things happening beneath what we see and we get to ruminate and understand why they all matter to the characters as things are revealed. The payoffs are well worth the wait.The extensive length is not what a screenwriting teacher would teach you to do as the story is not portioned in perfect thirds. Instead, the story structure adopts a novel-like approach and succeeds at what IT: Chapter Two failed to do at adapting its lengthy source material. The storytelling here had me hooked and pulled me in slowly into its expanding world.Ewan McGregor delivers a subdued reflective performance as an adult Danny Torrance. It's nothing high-octane in the range of Jack Nicholson or Shelley Duvall in The Shining. Danny walks like he's carrying a weight on his body all the time; Ewan McGregor sold the trauma well. Rebecca Ferguson steals the show as Rose the Hat, bringing mystique and guilty pleasure fun to a memorable villain. She is no longer Elsa Faust from Mission: Impossible anymore; Rose the Hat is so much cooler.Kyliegh Curran was also a scene-stealer as Abra Stone. Her acting was natural and it didn't feel pre-conceived. The scenes between Abra and Danny were engaging as we never have seen one shiner interacting with another this extended amount of time beyond sharing an ice cream. Their interactions lend for a much deeper dive into the world. Cliff Curtis and Emily Alyn Lind gave fine supporting performances as Billy Freeman, a friend of Danny's, and Snakebite Andi, a shiner who is the new recent member of the True Knot.In a world of de-aging special effects, it was such a relief seeing the characters from The Shining were actually age-accurate actors from 2019 doing an impersonation of the original cast. I wanted to high-five the movie going, ""Thank you! We don't need to see a computerized face of the original actor to recognize the character! Thanks for letting my mind make the connection, movie!""Doctor Sleep is not strictly a horror film, but rather a supernatural thriller about ghosts. 'Ghosts"" in the supernatural sense, yes. But also ""ghosts"" in the ""ghosts in the attic"" sense, which it's a story about dealing with past pain, making the decision to heal from it, and moving forward. Flanagan creates its scares with mood and atmosphere and there were very little jump scares if any. The terror doesn't come from shock or surprise but from the feeling of evil intentions.Mike Flanagan does a great balancing act of servicing the fans of Stephen King's novel and Stanley Kubrick's movie; there are many Easter eggs that will please fans and all the best stuff is brilliantly saved until the end. In an ideal world, I almost want the story to be bolder and go to places we haven't seen yet. It's almost there. This is where Doctor Sleep falls short of being great and just being really good. But it is pretty darn good.There's been a lot of death in my life this year. A number of people have passed in my social circle including a family member. I've attended two funerals within the past month. It's gotten me thinking about what people go through at the moment of death; a topic which I started Googling and reading about this on Reddit to ensure that people leave in peace, which seems to be the case usually. The image of an adult Danny Torrance comforting bedridden patients in their last moments in a movie was an accidental comfort that I didn't know I needed, but it helped tremendously. On a personal level, the hospice scenes were my favorite.Stephen King's criticism of how Kubrick's film being cold and cynical is clear to me now. The themes that Doctor Sleep brought up about the nature of addiction and rehabilitation were well-handled with a beating heart. You could feel that Stephen King has empathy for anyone struggling with an addiction and is trying to encourage them with, ""It's okay. You can do it. One step at a time.""It's unfortunate the film is not succeeding at the box office. I cannot even contemplate why that is. Do young people these days not know about The Shining? Maybe it's a marketing thing? Who knows? Hopefully, the film will find its audience later, because it deserves much better.",Doctor Sleep

Right before the half way mark it picked up and became very entertaining and creepy. Dose a good job being it's own thing and not a sequal. McGregor is a very good adult Danny. Had a nice ending as well. Overall even better than shining. Although shining had great performances and very good cinematography, and was well made, this kept me more entertained, and was creepier. Very good enjoyable follow up. You don't need to have seen shining to see this.",Doctor Sleep

295,WooderIce64,"Different, but Good",7,29 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining, which is one of the all-time classic horror films. The Shining isn't exactly a movie that demanded a sequel, but the demand was there for Stephen King to write a book sequel, which got made into this. It's also directed by Mike Flannagan, who directed Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House, which is an excellent show. It follows the adventures of a grown-up Danny and a girl named Abra Stone, who shines. Abra is hunted by Rose the Hat and the True Knot, a group of semi-immortal beings who feed on people, particularly kids, who shine. She seeks the help of Danny Torrance, who now works in hospice care. Ewan McGregor was great as Danny, but with the beard he just looks like Obi-Wan. The kid playing Abra also did well, which is good for such a young actress.The main difference between the Stanley Kubrick movie and this is that in The Shining, it's as psychological as it is supernatural. There's a very thin line between the result of being alone in a hotel in the mountains for months and there literally being ghosts in the original. Doctor Sleep is all about the supernatural. It has telepathy, astral projection, mind control, soul-sucking creatures, and the shining is essentially treated as a superpower, not too far off from Doctor Strange. The experiences Abra has with her shining is drastically different from Danny's in the original. Where in the Kubrick movie it was mostly just seeing disturbing things, here we see Abra interact with Rose the Hat and essentially psychically battle her. It's not bad, but it could definitely be off-putting to fans of the original. It's known that Stephen King hates Kubrick's Shining, so it makes you wonder what a version more faithful to the book would be like.Rose the Hat was a great villain. While it may be easy to compare her to Pennywise, they are different villains. She does feed on kids the way Pennywise does and employs many of the same tactics, but she's different because she is still a person, rather than a straight up evil demon. We see her leading the True Knot, her meditating, and a closer look at how she uses her powers. The scene where they eat the baseball kid was excessive, though. However, the True Knot is far from immortal. In fact, most of them get shot by Danny and his friend. Fantasy villains who die when shot are automatically lame.The last third of the movie is set at the Overlook Hotel, which is both a blessing and a curse. All the classic imagery from The Shining appears; the Grady Sisters, the blood in the elevator, the ""here's Johnny"" hole, ""redrum"" written on the door, Room 237, the hedge maze in the snow, and Midnight, the Stars, and You. On one hand, it's nice to see this stuff on the big screen, but most of it just feels forced. There's no reason to go to Room 237 and there's no reason for Midnight, The Stars, and You to play. It's good to see them, but they serve little purpose. There are good scenes in this sequence. Seeing Danny return to the places important to him was nice, making the things we know about character development rather than story tools. The scene where he meets Jack, who has essentially become Lloyd, was very well done.It is also appreciated that in an age where sequels to movies from a long time ago come out exactly the same as the previous one, this one manages to be distinctly different. If you took Danny and the Overlook out of this and replaced them with new stuff, it would still be a good movie.",Doctor Sleep
296,Opinion02122,Just plain awful,2,2 July 2020,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It seemed to have great potential, but it was just plain awful! I love good horror movies. I even enjoy mediocre horror movies. This doesn't even rise to the level mediocre. The story was boring! The characters were boring. The story line was choppy, jumping around. Why would they kill some people with the ""shine,"" but accept another? No explanation. LOTS of holes. A total waste of time! I DID want to see if tge Director's Cut was any better, so I watched it, too. If you have a choice, go for tge Director's Cut. It is longer, and set up in sections, has much better continuity!

I must say I enjoyed it especially since I decided to view this as its' own film, not a Shining sequel. It was by no means perfect, I'm still slightly confused about the entire steam situation and why they sought children.

It has mediocre to weak acting, a very confusing plot and horror elements that are losely tied together without making any sense. I must admit I gave the film more than an hour to grow on me but all that grew was my desire to fall asleep. It is boring and bad.

Acting is great, pacing is great. Enjoyable.It does reference the Kubrick Movie - some lines, events, cinematography and scoring, but it's more based on the Kind source material and mini-series - which BTW is excellent if you haven't seen it. Doesn't have nickelson's OTT and memorable performance, but the other characters are much deeper, the situation more grounded, and the lore more explained.If you haven't watched the mini-series, it might be good to watch that first.

During the first half of the movie moved completely well and was good. Some scenes like soul harvesting and the old guy with a story on surviving many centuries did give me chills but for a couple of mins. I actually felt bad that baddies managed to live and survive that long but ended up completely wiped out in a gun battle taking Danny's best friend obviously away from the equation which is completely predicted.Danny trapping rose in his old mansion and

The young Curran plays a girl with the shining, and she does not withhold her psychic powers which lead her to confrontation with a group of lifesuckers that calls itself the True Knot. Besides Curran, other members of the cast that impress include Rebecca Ferguson as a menacing Rose the Hat, Carl Lumbly in two scenes as Dick Hallorann and Ewan McGregor in top form as the adult Danny Torrance. Forget the nonsensical story and watch without overthinking or asking too many questions. The movie itself is entertaining because of the action, suspense, special effects and of course, superb cast.

Starring Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson and Kyliegh Curran.""Doctor Sleep"" is the continuation of Danny Torrance's story 40 years after the terrifying events of Stephen King's The Shining. Still irrevocably scarred by the trauma he endured as a child at the Overlook, Dan Torrance has fought to find some semblance of peace. But that peace is shattered when he encounters Abra, a courageous teenager with her own powerful extrasensory gift, known as the ""shine."" Instinctively recognizing that Dan shares her power, Abra has sought him out, desperate for his help against the merciless Rose the Hat and her followers, The True Knot, who feed off the shine of innocents in their quest for immortality. Forming an unlikely alliance, Dan and Abra engage in a brutal life-or-death battle with Rose. Abra's innocence and fearless embrace of her shine compel Dan to call upon his own powers as never before-at once facing his fears and reawakening the ghosts of the past.The Shining is a great psychological horror movie, I think it's one of the best horror movie, though it suffers from Shelley Duvall's bad performance and Danny Lloyd's mediocre performance.I loved The Shining and I was highly anticipating Doctor Sleep, based on Stephen King's novel with the same name, and thankfully, Doctor Sleep didn't disappoint.. at all! I think Doctor Sleep is one of the best movie of 2019, and of course it's the best horror movie of 2019, though we didn't get that much of compelling horror movies this year, Doctor Sleep is actually is the best horror movie we got in years, and I could see people arguing about that, fans are kinda nitpicky some stuff about the movie, and critics too, but still, thankfully, people do still appreciate this movie!There're so many reasons why do I love this movie, and why do I think it's such a perfect movie, and only thing that I could think of now is Mike Flanagan, this guy has a great history of horror movies, and a TV-show too, he's creative and innovative, he made good horror movies, he has a great way of building tension and suspense, which this movie is full of. Doctor Sleep is beautifully shot and written, he did an amazing job filming this movie, and he didn't play on the nostalgic feelings more than creating his own masterpiece, and that's what Kubrick did too in The Shining, but Flanagan did an amazing job with the cinematography, and the editing too, I think Doctor Sleep is one of the best -if not the best- directed movies of 2019! He also respected Kubrick's The Shining with some tributes to The Shining, the water and the island, the car driving on the mountain road, the blood from the elevator, one character approaching the other on the stairs and the hitting with the axes.. some other shots too.Everything Flanagan did with this movie was amazing, the angles that he used, the movement of the camera, the close-ups, the long-takes.. everything he did was jaw-dropping, even the use of slow-motion, which wan't used often thankfully, was so earned! And I was so happy to see those tributes with The Shining theme!There are also some scenes from the past, which he had to use the same characters, but he didn't use CGI to show the same actors who was in The Shining, he used other actors to do so, and there're some scenes that was in the first movie that he used in this movie, but he didn't use the same scenes, he used the same angles of shotting, but he changes the actors, and that felt earned, because if he used the same scenes with the same actors of the previous movie, that would definitely take us away from the movie, he built the movie with these actors as those characters in the beginning, so he had to do the same at the end, and he did!Everything behind the camera was made perfectly, so was everything in front of the camera, Ewan McGregor was mesmerizing as the older version of Danny, he did an amazing job capturing that guy who's having a hard time adjusting in his life, with that power that only brings him fear, he also uses it to comfort elder people, and that's what makes his character so investing, with McGregor's amazing performance, my favorite part of the movie, it's an undoubtedly one of the best performances of the year!Speaking of amazing performances, Rebecca Ferguson did an amazing job as the main villain of this movie, Rose the Hat, which's one of the best villains of this year, and it's not only that Ferguson portrayed her flawlessly, it's because of the characterization of the whole group of hers, it's really hard to find a villain that you love and hate nowadays, and The True Knot of course is one that you hate and love, you love because of the performances and the motivations, because you understand why they're doing what they're doing, even if it's wrong, and you hate that, and that's why you hate them, because they do terrible things to achieve what they want to achieve, and this's why they're so compelling, not because of the villainous things they do, it's because they're doing this for a very good reason.Kyliegh Curran is also amazing in this movie, she gave us the best child-performance of this year, she's so great in this movie, and compelling too!Everything behind and in front of the camera was perfect, let's now talk about the movie itself, how was it as a horror movie, and well, this is a great horror movie, for the fans of Kubrick's The Shining it might disappoint them a little, well I'm a fan of The Shining but I keep an open-mind when I watch movie, this movie relies a little bit on jump scares more than psychological horror, and people who loved how psychologically disturbing The Shining and wanted to see the same in the sequel will get disappointed, yeah the movie doesn't rely on that too much, but it's not as psychological as The Shinning was, but it has some very disturbing moments too, but, for the sake of comparison, The Shining is a better psychological horror movie, but Doctor Sleep is a better modern horror movie, because Flanagan had to upgrade the sequel to live in 2019, he could rely on what Kubrick relied on in 1980, you see where I'm getting there? It's the matter of time differences.Doctor Sleep is definitely a scary movie, it's so scary, it works very much as a horror movie, but not like how The Shining was, and that's kinda a thing that I like, I like seeing upgrades over the original, and Doctor Sleep is scary, but differently, so don't take that as a flaw, but as a filmmaker trying to make his own movie.The movie is also amazing at studying alcoholic people, and depression, it was a little bit of a drama movie, and it showed that in a couple of dialogues, and that was amazing to see in this movie, because The Shining also had some marriage drama too, and Doctor Sleep did that but in a different kind of drama too, and it did that amazingly!Doctor Sleep is an amazing movie, I think it's the best horror movie of 2019, and it's the fourth movie this year that I'm gonna give an A+!Does that mean that I liked it more than The Shining? Well, sometimes yeah, and sometimes no, I would just say that it's makes a good equation!Thank you as always for reading my review, look forward for more reviews very soon.",Doctor Sleep
305,rowanmaillot,Heerree's Part 2!,10,25 January 2020,"SPOILERS: The flashback sequences in this film are exactly on point to the original, such as when it shows when Jack is chasing Danny through the hedge maze, but there is much more to the story than that. Danny is an alcoholic struggling with his past, his mother had just recently passed away, and still struggled with his father's death at the Overlook hotel. So he signs up to a program where you release all your feelings, he claims he is an alcohol addict. And then the story moves on to a girl who also had what Danny has, the shining, she has lots of powers (spoiler her dad dies). The story may not be as intriguing and breathtaking as The Shining, but it is still a solid experience and deserves a watch. Grade: A+",Doctor Sleep
306,A_Llama_Drama,Entertaining fluff but suffers the same troubles as the book,5,24 September 2020,"Doctor Sleep is a fun continuation of King's ""Shining."" Except this time, Dan is now a sabotaging alcoholic doing what he can to keep the shining at bay. Meeting Abra, a child who shines strong, he reluctantly learns to care again and save the life of gifted youngster from monsters.Its all so terribly simple, yet King managed to find some energy to it all with a nasty cast of villains and a scary return to Danny's horrors. Flanagan does keep it going strong despite it being one hell of a long horror (with little to actually do) runtime but he makes the same mistakes King made in the book, and adds more.First, young Abra. Abra is a child, it's true, and kids arent that interesting, but at least in the book, Abra carries an innocence that gets twisted into menace after witnessing a brutal murder. Shes giddy with power and ignorant. Movie Abra is far too old. She just appears to be a sociopath. The actress, miscast, plays Abra with omniscience, making it even harder to understand why Danny is with her. She'll be fine alone, it would seem. The villains, terrifying for all of half an hour, begin to look like lambs once Abra finds them. Its a shame, when Flanagan showed promise in his earlier movies (and his heightened adaptation of ""Gerald's Game"") that he wasn't able to elevate the work here to something better.My biggest gripe is the return to the hotel. Danny in the book had to witness his father butcher himself, his last selfless act before succumbing completely to the hotel. Dan returning is a moment of catharsis and confrontation of a place that has consumed him jnto his adult life, horrors of a life wasted passed down a generation. But Kubrick's ""Shining"" was not the same beast. So for Flanagan to stage the finale in a place that, while historically in cinema means something, it doesnt mean the same for movie Dan. It just feels likw poor fan service. And to be attached to a story as simple as ""young girl must be saved from old woman who wants to eat her,"" it feels like a waste of potential.Overall, its fun, and Rebecca Ferguson and Ewan McGregor are great at going loggerheads, but it trips up the same places as the book and then some.",Doctor Sleep
307,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Doctor Sleep is a Dream Not a Nightmare,7,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Not scary at all and far too longThe Big Screen: Visually there are some very cool tricks and a nice stroll down memory Shining road.The Final Bill: If you're looking to be scared, this isn't the movie for you; but, if you want to be entertained and stuck in the movie magic (for 2 hours), try your luck.-S2S: Movie ReviewWelcome back to Stream to Big Screen. This week we are glad to have before you a movie adaptation of Stephen King's thriller, Doctor Sleep. The book, Doctor Sleep, was published in 2013 and filmmakers moved quickly to give the masses the sequel to The Shining they've been waiting for. So let's dive deep into this thriller.First, the movie is beautiful visually. I did have some qualms with the younger versions of characters used, but that's not important. Nevertheless, there are some really cool flying/floating/Dr. Strange-like sequences in the movie. The movie has some good CGI technology, but there could have been even more. The storyline is cool even though I got annoyed with the interchangeable nature of their use of the word shining and steam. PICK ONE ALREADY! Sorry for that outburst.Next, I would've appreciated more depth into the explanation of shining, steam, and the individual new characters. This explanation is something that I'm sure, in the novel, Stephen King got into thoroughly. Even without the full look into each character, individually all of the actors did a solid job. Rebecca Ferguson, as Rose The Hat, is simply enchanting. I really enjoyed her performance of the character. Ewan as Danny... not so much. I can't tell if he did a bad job or the writing and directing was that poor. Either way Ewan needed a do over.Unfortunately, Doctor Sleep was more of a walk down memory lane than a hotly anticipated horror classic sequel. Nothing is truly creepy about this movie, compared to The Shining, but the viewer does get 2 or 3 eerie or tough moments to view. Mainly, we got some of the classic movie scenes from The Shining, with further detail bringing us to the present, mixed with a completely different storyline. The director relied too much upon the strength of The Shining rather than fully embracing what is cool and creepy about the Doctor Sleep book. In reality, the Doctor Sleep storyline could be way more creepy and enthralling than was displayed. The movie does an okay job giving us to the idea but is far too shallow. The viewer needs more depth and I'm sure the book fans would agree. Flanagan failed to make us dive deep into the movie/pages of the book. What the viewer got was a slightly creepier version of Darkest Minds, Twilight and Hocus Pocus. On top of that, the horror fans would be left wanting by the end of the movie.Long story short, Doctor Sleep failed in the ways of a horror movie but succeeded in the ways of a teen coming of age superhero origin story. If you're looking to be scared like The Shining, you will be disappointed but if you come to be entertained and held in suspense, this may be a the movie for you. Horror/Shining fans, I would recommend just catching this on netflix but everyone else I'd recommend a matinee showing, if you have a free 2 hours and 20 minutes on this chilly Veteran's Day weekend.",Doctor Sleep

The acting was quite good, it was just a poor storyline. I found it overly simplistic, almost as if geared towards children or slow-witted teens (note, I would not recommend this for children). It could have been much more. However, it was mildly entertaining, albeit slow. Not a bad watch, but had so much potential.",Doctor Sleep

""Doctor Sleep""???... there were like 30 seconds of the title that made sense, the rest of the nearly 2 1/2 hour movie was spent trying to reach back to The Shining, which by the way, the recreated bar scene was awful. (Sorry Henry Thomas). Some things in Hollywood legend need to be left alone. But I digress. I couldn't get the ""weirdos"" who chased and preyed on children while driving a Winnebago Camper. Their whole group led by the capable and very sexy Rebecca Ferguson was all a waste of time. They had nothing to do with the Overlook Hotel and no connection to Danny Torrence. And speaking of Danny, or ""Dan"" for this movie, Ewan MacGregor was completely miscast. No way a grown up Danny would resemble or act in any way, shape or form to EM. No way. If Stephen King or anyone else wanted to pay a homage to The Shining, this wasn't it. Grade: C Minus.",Doctor Sleep
310,helenbassett,Doctor Sleep Film Review - Mike Flanagan Directs Ewan McGregor Along The Snowy Road Towards The Overlook Hotel,10,4 December 2019,"Still traumatised by the events of his youth, Danny Torrance has reached adulthood as an emotional husk. Now in Mike Flanagan's Doctor Sleep, and played by Ewan McGregor, he was encouraged as a child to lock away his demons from The Overlook Hotel by his friend Dick, played by Carl Lumbly, and hide his shine. The same shine that the long dead ghosts were attracted to all those years ago. And maybe Danny has doused his in alcohol as he winds up in 2011 in a Stephen King New Hampshire town. But he is not his father and finds a purpose; a new home, the AA and even some friends. Although one of them only communicates via the blackboard in his loft.And with good reason to hide his shine, for unknown to Danny there are a group of travellers led by Rebecca Ferguson as Rose The Hat, beautiful and deadly, what is she hiding under there? Her group called The True Knot are, let's say vampire travellers through time, feasting on the fear and pain of those children who shine. Just like Danny.With their last can of shine almost gone, the group need a fresh kill. Especially with a new member to feed and an ageing skeleton who appears to have been there since the dawn of time. Carel Struycken plays Grampa Flick, he was Lurch in The Addams Family, and there could be no greater role for him. But he is fading fast. Zahn McClarnon's Crow Daddy has been watching out for those who shine. And Jacob Tremblay using his, as potential star baseball player Bradley Trevor, has been spotted. The True Knot can take a child and use them all up, or torture them over time, feeding gradually. This is probably the hardest part of the film.But Rose and the True Knot have been seen by Danny's blackboard friend. And Rose is determined that they will have her shine. Perhaps keeping her alive so they can feed on her tremendous power over the coming centuries.And Doctor Sleep has its chills. It's not scary, but after the laughably awful fun house horror of It: Chapter Two, there is a psychic horror present here. With the True Knots lighting up when they feed, and the gruesomeness of their crimes. But not when Danny, or Doctor Sleep, with his job in a hospice over the last eight years, helping those taking their last breaths to prepare for death. Such beautiful calming moments at our most vulnerable time. And a cat that knows when it's time.But when his blackboard friend turns up in town one day to tell him what has happened to Bradley, Danny turns away from what the magical Abra has seen. Unwilling to open those long closed boxes again. But young Kyleigh Curran carries a heavy burden as she is on the True Knot's radar now. Her and Rose are astral projecting into each other's minds, in amazing CGI with unexpected results, and only Dick, returning to Danny one last time, persuades him to help her. Good sport and friend Billy goes along for the ride, this will also take a hell of a lot of explaining to the authorities though. And poor Cliff Curtis isn't sure where this mad story is taking him.But we know that Mike Flanagan is directing us through the snowy roads to the Overlook Hotel. To the sleeping source of evil. Stephen King's follow up to The Shining takes the Stanley Kubrick classic scenes from the beloved film to find its own rhythm, while it fans the flames of the past to devour the present.Although the film ran to just over 150 minutes it kept the attention with an active storyline and terrific acting. I have questions which I guess are explained in the books. Although they are both perfectly watchable without having read them. I came to The Shining late given I was too young for the original film, but why is the hotel so evil? Is it built on an old Indian burial ground?? And is Johnny in a time loop in The Shining? He's still there but now he's ET's Henry Thomas. Does evil ever really die?, because if not then I am already looking forward to Doctor Sleep 2. And we know all the characters will be back for round two. With iconic cinematography by Michael Fimognari it was a great journey back.",Doctor Sleep
311,pazu7,What was the fuss about?,5,11 February 2020,"What was the fuss all about? I mean, it was OK... but just OK. Rather generic, actually, for the supposed follow-up to Kubrick's classic. I've read King's criticism of Kubrick's interpretation, and I get it. I actually agree with much of his complaint. But there's a big difference between how a story unfolds on the page and on the screen. Dr Sleep goes way too far in the direction opposite of what Kubrick took. I can see how much of this would work in the novel (which I have not read) where King is free to narrate introspection and history. But in the film it comes off as clunky exposition. There's no sense of realism. Huge chunks of this story could have been snipped and they would have had a much tighter, and much scarier, product. There are a few great films from King's work. This isn't one. Some good scenes, I admit. But overall, meh. I heard there is a directors cut. Maybe I'll give that a shot.",Doctor Sleep
312,monberger,As good as reading Stephen King's books!!!,9,12 November 2019,"What a suspenseful and terrifying film. It is that good!!! I don't know what critics want to see in a movie.

313,Schuriken,Doctor Boring,1,4 November 2019,"2.5 hours of a sequel to The Lost Boys with a bunch of ghosts from The Shining at the end. I think Stephen King is just plain boring and should just leave us in peace and take John Carpenter with him. Im not impressed by these crapiolas anymore, 40 years for a sequel and Halloween sequels and reboots no more.Story mediocre but movie adaptations were ok. Rebootings wont make them any better. It's just the same boring movie again and staying true to the book just isn't working at all.This movie isn't a horror movie its more like a psycho thriller, to be honest it should have been a horror movie and 1 hour shorter too with more Vampires.Just put it out of it's Misery, let us be.

314,suprabhattacharya,Shining originality,8,11 November 2019,"**SPOILERS**The film though claims it to be a sequel of ""The shining"",honestly it is not.The film must be recognised as a standalone adaptation of a Stephen King novel.The originality of Flanagan make it a quite enjoyable watch.The best seller king novel ""Doctor Sleep"" in 2013 is forcefully related to "" The Shining"" as the film both for attraction.
The film manages to deliver a unsettling experience of two and a half hours.Flanegan as Kubrick has also been unfaithful to the novel.The novel has more insights to the character of Danny Torrance and his hereditary rage and drinkings but the film potrays Dan as a vulnerable man getting over the death of her wife and son.He is gentle,weak and searching for solace.The ghosts of overlook hotel lurks him all the time jeopardizing his life.The other characters has also been somewhat altered in the adaptation.
""The shining"" was vividly psychic and atmospheric whereas ""Dr sleep"" relies mainly on supernatural elements,satanic groups and focuses more on meaning of the word shining(as defined in Kubrick film).The creepiness works well enough to keep the audience engaged.Mike Flanagan has no doubt made one of the better Stephen King novel based films in recent times.The film takes some time to build the characters . The film has potrayed the supernatural elements in the most natural ways ,in that way the film is not a 'horror' film.It is more a film about fear ,a film about greed.The film works brilliantly around the first two acts with It's competent screenplay and direction.But the film when turns to Overlook hotel,it becomes just like a theme park visit.The ghosts of ""The shinning"" just appears there as nostalgia or a tribute.They don't scare or disturb you anymore and forcibly make you realize that Dr sleep is a sequel to The Shining which seems quite unoriginal and blunt.
Kyleigh Curran is convincing on her role and his scenes with Ewan mcGregor works well establishing a effortless and soothing chemistry.The role of Rosie is played to perfection by Rebecca Ferguson,her take as a flirting antagonist works well.Well ,you cannot compare Nicholson with McGregor .The roles played by them are completely opposite.Mcgregor has shined with his rusty persona which just fits in the role written for him.The editing has been commendable for a horror (fear) flick.
The background score is chilling enough to make the film more darker than horrific.Except the theme park visit to overlook hotel and bluntly unoriginal vfx sometimes,the film works well as a standalone film.",Doctor Sleep
315,Mike_O_Dwyer,Dr Sleep is a Dull Snore,3,10 December 2019,"When Stephen King hit the bookstands in the 70s he was a breath of fresh air. Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining, The Stand, and The Dead Zone made him a name to look forward to for any teenager wanting thrills and scares between the pages of a book.Then came Cujo, the stupidest book I'd ever read, to that point. Soon after came Christine (Cujo with wheels) and Pet Sematary (Cujo with a cat) and that was it. As far as I was concerned King had turned into a hack churning out muck not worth spending money on. There was no going back. I'm sure he was gutted, desperately looking for solace in his increasing popularity and fortunes. I caved when Dr Sleep came out, the first King book I'd read in decades, and it was a waste - a book full of barely realised characters hitting plot-points with the dull thudding regularity of a fading heartbeat.To take that anemic story and drop it into the hands of Mike Flanagan is a surefire way to make the plodding at least look pretty. King himself might not have much time for Kubrick's film, but it's one of the few times his stories catch fire on screen and by far the most stylish and disconcerting. Flanagan has a visual style that's quite distinctive, but it's alway pretty, well lit, and vibrant, which doesn't necessarily sit well within the scare genres. There's also a surprising lack of tension and pacing to his films, as if you're watching storyboard panels being displayed, all of them equally sized and displayed at regularly spaced intervals - when things should be speeded up like a runaway train to deliver a punch they come at you like a slow moving wheelchair. There are no shocks or scares. Nothing surprises.Worst of all the story and characters feel dated, and silly. Bad guys needing to bottle the screams of children to survive, isn't that Monsters Inc?",Doctor Sleep
316,Exiled_Universe,A weird yet very good movie.,8,18 February 2020,"So this movie is either slightly better than expected of as expected, i dont really know which one to go under but i might just say it was slightly better than expected. Anyway before i saw this i was pretty surprised and excited that this was gonna be a sequel to the shining so that made me pretty happy and made me really wanna see it. So now after seeing it, it was OK. I mean there was a lot of references and things that happened in the original shining but i feel like there wasn't enough, i mean there was even a lookalike of Jack Nickleson which was a little weird but it was OK. There was also some cool scenes that weren't in the trailer like the shootout scene, who would have thought there wold have been a shootout with rifles in a forest shooting at crazy magic people, who thought that would have anything to do with the shining, i guess the original shining is deeper than you thought. So is it scary, at some points it gets scary and weird but i personally didnt really get scared . The acting and stuff was great. Also in the trailer i saw the part where it was like he was looking through the door like jack was in the shining. Also there is a lot of moments in the movie where they copy moments from the original and it looks cool and i was like wow like the scene on the stairs. Overall it was OK and a good film!",Doctor Sleep
317,MK_Ultra_,"I came, I saw...",3,4 February 2020,"And left shaking my head.As much as I can appreciate a well-made sequel of sorts, they are---at the same time---rare (keywords well-made)This one tries to hard, right out of the gate, to ape the atmospheres and cinematography of the original. So much so, it pushes the whole ""homage"" right out of the way, and looks laughable in it's attempts to emulate Kubrick.They went as far, in this one, to 'blend' and re-shoot and inject Kubick's scenes into this film with clunky casting of similar looking and sounding actors from the original in the first act which was eye-rolling and nothing more than gimmick.The film plods along in it's quasi green filter/pseudo noir that feels out of place here, for a timeline of a story that is now in the future from the original. Why not just make your own film instead of inferior filming techniques to copy the feel of, arguably, one of the best sub-genre films of all time? This was what I was up against as a viewer.The higher ratings are what they are, opinions. If we all liked the same things and held the same opinion on films, there would be no need to even review or cast an opinion---but being a Kubrick nut, as well as being a fan of horror, this one is weighed down by gimmicks and bad writing.

Most Stephen King book adaptions to film are usually pretty weak, including The Shining, but I have always read to book first and we all know its extremely hard to like the movie anywhere near the book. Since I have not read Doctor Sleep yet, I had absolutely no idea what was coming and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much this movie creeped me out. There is a scene that will probably haunt my dreams because it was very disturbing. The movie is very dark, unpredictable, well acted, and tense.At over 2 1/2 hours, it was a bit longer than it needed to be, but it really was not an issue at making this movie completely watchable and it was better than The Shining.",Doctor Sleep

Its fairly decent as a more gore fest horror with a supernatural twist, more Evil Dead than a psychological horror which was what the original story was.
Its long at 2hr 30 mins but it does keep you watching.
Trouble is the first story/movie was very original with iconic acting and scenes. Dr Sleep doesn't have that apart from copying the scenes from the original.

330,e-m-hobo,A sequel to the first MOVIE with cheap mistakes,4,26 July 2021,"Not even close to Stephen King kind of fare. The characters weren't dug out the way they should, but instead like with the first movie it focused mostly on the main plot without offering room to develop subplots for as far as they could be avoided. The subplots, for as far as there were any, were only touched upon lightly, showing how Dan could console a soul or two, but not showing the true struggle he had that in the end was briefly mentioned in resolving the story.And then they unresolved the story, because they wanted to have a bookend? I mean, really? Purified in the first few sentences of the last scene and to close off the scene what was purified is foul and present as ever? Self-contradictory. The ending was a major mistake with the usual Hollywood handshake making it even worse.They also used footage of the first movie even though they had new actors playing these characters in this movie, meaning they should have reshot the scenes, but they didn't bother to.In all honesty, as soon as the Warner Brothers logo at the beginning was shown the way it looked in the eighties and they played the same soundtrack the first movie used to hook us in, they sunk the ship. No line could save them.The actors were magnificent, ravishing in their roles, but in the end they couldn't save the ""let's make a cheap buck""-feel the movie had. The director or Warner Brothers or whoever made the decision also made the mistake of switching from one directing style to the one used in the first movie here and there, which broke me out of the movie, because it ripped scenes straight off the narrative, putting them in a disintegrated collage.They also didn't bother to match cut in the maze between the girl and the hat, introducing a mild jump, which felt really unbalanced. It felt rushed, cheap, and careless.A complete waste of talent considering all of the promise it showed in many places also in terms of much of the excellent videography. A lot of people with many great skills were involved only for a cheap bandit to stick it together. A waste, a waste, a waste... Just a waste of talent.",Doctor Sleep

Shout out to Mike Flanagan for being so bold executing one of the most disturbing scene in my history of watching movies, which he paid by bringing a satisfying and painful end for a bunch of gypsies who just want to live forever, which is the highlight of the entire story, at least for me. Love the dynamics between Danny (Ewan Mcgregor) and Abra (uuhhhh, what's the actress' name? Nevermind, I like her very much here), as if we are looking at the journey of two veteran and a much younger but more talented mutants before being recruited by the X-Men. For those of you who are the fans of Flanagan's previous work, The Haunting of Hill House, do not hope to be entertained by the horror tone he brought there. Like Warner Bros' previous project, IT Chapter 2, the power of this movie doesn't not lies with being frightened by the terror of evil devils/demons/ghosts/phantoms/souls/evil forces, but by his handling of nostalgic moments, and how our two main characters devise their revenge plot against the real devils in flesh.",Doctor Sleep

Although this film is lengthy at 2 and a half hours, some pieces were left out, especially in the final confrontation scene and some changes were just random details (e.g. white cat instead of black cat). instead of a regular movie review I decided to write this in a from of questions and answers:
Q: Should I watch this movie? - Yes, it is a fun and enjoyable slasher.
Q: Should I watch the original ""The Shining"" first - Yes, aside from the fact that some flashbacks will make no sense without seeing ""The Shining"" first, it is a classic and has much bigger psychological effect than this one. In fact, if you have to choose just one of these movies, there is no doubt you should not choose this one.
Q: Is it really gory? - There is quite some of that, but it really tamed, I would let a mature 13 yr old watch this, it's not that bad. Even people that die evaporate into smoke, there is almost no blood and no nudity other than ""the old lady in the tub""

Doctor Sleep literally just lazy compilation of others King's work, and like not horror at all. Its very close to The Lost Boys and similar modern days vampire films, its just urban fantasy! And overall, I always remember how King loves take a massive load of crap at Kubricks version, and YET! he agree to reference in his new film to that like he said ""abomination"", it was very liberal decision, in really most worst meaning.

This story doesn't feel like it the sequel to The Shining. King should've done better than this. First of all, the movie is long and boring. Ewan McGregor is somewhat miscast as Danny this version of Danny come off as a sad and mild man. The little girl who play Abra can't act but she only act better when she with McGregor, when she was possessed by him and near the end of the movie.

Those are the major differences to mention besides some minor ones but even with the differences it's still really good. So I finished the book and the differences between the ending are pretty major but I'm neutral about it cause instead of making it a happy ending like the book dave, billy and Dan die which is the total opposite of what everything else is in today's world, rose dies by abra pushing her off of a roof while in the movie Dan releases all the monsters in his lock boxes in his mind to kill rose and ends with abra going into the bathroom to trap one of the monsters that's in there and in the book it focuses on more members of the true knot but in the movie it mainly focuses on rose, the crow and andi.

Where do I even start with this amazing movie.First of all, let's talk about Rebecca Ferguson's performance..... OUTSTANDING to say the least. Her portrayal of Rose the Hat was just so sly, seductive, intimidating, and horrific all at the same time, this role really solidified her as one of my favorite actors.Next, the storyline/plot. In an age of the same old sh*t being done again and again, this one was different, in the best way. So much goes on and so many storylines eventually interlink seamlessly. Alot of homage to The Shining is paid here, yet it seems like it's own story entirely, while also being an acceptable sequal.And finally, the music/cinematography/atmosphere is breathtaking, the visuals in this movie alone make it worth watching.9 out of 10... Only because I felt there was alot left to the imagination about the origins of 'the shine' and 'The true Knot' that I felt could've been explained.

None of the characters were developed, the plot was predictable and by the numbers and, perhaps due to the writing, the actors were forgettable. I'm not sure Ewan McGregor was the right actor for the lead either here.The Shining connection really feels superfluous and a cash grab. Take off the flashback at the beginning and the location of the scene at the end and the movie would've worked just as well, and it might've been easier to give it a pass as just another average Stephen King story with kooky villans. We never saw all this 'steam' in the original movie, the Overlook doesn't feel at all ominous and the only actor who seemed close to any of the characters in the original was Carl Lumbly, the rest all seemed awkward.The worst part of it all though was that the film is neither scary, suspenseful or even unsettling at any point.",Doctor Sleep

346,rustonreviews,Doctor Sleep is a great film for fans of both King and Kubrick.,8,9 November 2019,"Although considered a timeless horror classic by both critics and audiences alike, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) remains famously loathed by Stephen King to this day. Despite the authors widely recognised disappointment with Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, the film has stood the test of time as one of horror cinema's greatest achievements. In 2013, King released a follow-up novel, Doctor Sleep, which provides the basis for Flanagan's latest King adaptation (his second following 2017's Gerald's Game) starring McGregor as a middle-aged Danny Torrance, still haunted by the traumatic events that took place at the malevolent Overlook Hotel decades ago. While regularly attending AA meetings, Danny secures a job at a hospice where he comforts dying patients with a little help from his supernatural abilities, soon acquiring the title of Doctor Sleep as a result of his unorthodox methods. Meanwhile, a group of quasi-immortals operating under the moniker True Knot seek to drain the steam from within supernaturally gifted children who 'shine', just like Danny, in order to retain their youth.Enter Mike Flanagan (Oculus (2011), The Haunting of Hill House (2018)) who was burdened with the insurmountable task of not only crafting an adaptation that King himself would be proud of, but also a sequel that would impress fans of Kubrick's acclaimed original. Flanagan, who stands as one of modern horror's most prominent writer/directors right now, strikes a perfect balance with Doctor Sleep. It is a film that establishes itself as a completely different beast to Kubrick's film, while also drawing just enough influence from what's come before to please die-hard fans of what Kubrick established with his own vision. Ewan McGregor is well cast as a damaged Danny Torrance, but it's Rebecca Ferguson's captivating performance as Rose the Hat, the enigmatic leader of the True Knot, that steals the show. Fuelled with malevolence, Ferguson's deranged antagonist serves as one of Doctor Sleep's most exciting performances, and she's an absolute joy to watch. Kyliegh Curran also turns in a solid performance as Abra, a gifted young girl who shares a telepathic connection with Danny.As is often the case with Flanagan's work, jump scares are practically non-existent. Instead, Flanagan focuses on atmosphere and tension to elevate the sequences of terror. During a grueling sequence that displays the True Knot's ability to drain children of their shine, Flanagan chooses not to hold back from depicting a scenario that will undoubtedly unease the most hardened of viewers. Stylistically speaking, Flanagan often channels Kubrick's visionary flairs to replicate certain shots that pay homage to the original film. Although both films are totally different from one another, Doctor Sleep serves as a terrific companion piece to the 1980 classic that fans of both Kubrick and King can appreciate. It's certainly an exciting journey with instances of some amazing cinematography (a sequence involving Rose scouring the night sky is a particularly captivating, dream-like moment), and Flanagan's screenplay is brilliantly paced, completely engrossing, and never dull. Doctor Sleep stands as the best Stephen King adaptation to be released this year, and one of the better horror efforts, too. Simply put, Doctor Sleep truly shines.",Doctor Sleep

He really got that the things we don't understand are what scare us the most. Doctor Sleep is not the Shining. Dr. Sleep is a suspense tale and a tale of redemption of a low man turned hero. Dr. Sleep doesn't leave a lot of unanswered questions. Its a good story, and the acting is fine. I like Ewan McGregor very much as an actor, but I have to say it was an odd choice here. He just doesn't seem to fit the roll. Many call backs to Kubricks Shining and a few less subtle ones to Kings novel the Shining. - 1 star because the Shining is flawless and -1 start for the choice of McGregor even though he's watchable.",Doctor Sleep
348,theterminator-92378,A Return To The Overlook And The Terrifying story of Stephen King,9,10 November 2019,"Following the release of the book by the same name a movie following the story of Danny Torrence dealing with addiction and his own personal demons from his past, and trying to protect a girl with the same ability from people who consume those who have the shinning ability.
Doctor sleep really dives deep into Danny and his problems with his life post 1980's The Shinning and it deals with the alcoholism and also Danny repressing his shinning ability, which I really like and you understand just how harshly life was for Danny and also how he was affected by what happend when he was a kid. The sinister Rose the hat is someone who is literally has to be one of the best villians of the stephen king universe. Every moment that she has on screen she has the most likeable demeanour and has some very evil intensions and her and her whole group of friends who end up being better and better and the cult is terrifying. Abra is great as well and she really must be as strong if not stronger than Danny, and she probably would have followed the same past as Danny but she you can see is someone who imbraces the shinning ability, which when the story picks up with her when she is grown up you understand why the cult is after her.
The cast is so great Ewen Mcgregor is so great as Danny he has done trainspotting before this movie and you know that he's really good at playing, someone who has addiction problems like that and he really does a great job and he should get recognition for this role he really does a amazing job in this role.Rebbeca Ferguson is amazing as Rose the hat I have said it before she is so creepy and great and I think she was made for this role, and she really is so great. Kyliegh Curran again I have said that she is really good as Abra Stone, and she works so well with Ewen Mcgregor and their dynamic is so great and is really a drving force of the movie.
Also in the cast is Cliff Curtis,Zahn McClarnon,Emily Alyn Lind,Selena Anduze,Robert Longstreet,Carel Struycken,Catherine Parker,Zackary Momoh,Jocelin Donahue and Jacob Tremblay.
I really liked Doctor Sleep it blends spine tingling chills and blends the nostaglia of the original Kubrick film and honestly, it's for me up there for the greatest movie of the year and the only problem I have is when they go inbetween the moments of the orginal they just don't feel authentic to the orginal, I don't know why but it really just akes me out of the movie but it is a minor thing in a other wise great movie.",Doctor Sleep
349,jayroscoe,Okay,5,22 February 2020,"Rarely does a sequel equal or surpass the original- and this one did not.
Rose Hat looks amazingly like Sandra Bullock and did a very good job.
But the writing overall just wasn't that good. Also still not sure why Hollywood is obsessed with over-representing Black people and yet Hispanics are pretty much absent in most movies.
I guess they must be trying to make up for years of their discrimination against Blacks.
This is also definitely NOT a movie for children !",Doctor Sleep

This was visually appealing , well acted and true to the feeling of the original .The cinematography was so well done . Especially once the arrive back to Colorado . The scenes back in the hotel matched the camera angles and filters from the first movie and brought the same vibe . The characters were distinct , the use of color was incredible throughout.All the characters were extremely well acted . The casted well and there was great character development . Danny was played well and his characteristics were tied well from the child of the Shining .Overall I really really liked this . I was intrigued and on the edge of my seat start to finish . I would recommend this , I would suggest rewatching or maybe watching the Shining for the first time before trying this . Worth the time and worth the 2.5 hours .",Doctor Sleep

354,asd29,"Despite some character development flaws, this is the best horror sequel since psycho 2 in 1983.",7,29 August 2020,"This very belated sequel is the follow up to stanley kubricks the shining (1980) danny torrance (doc) is now an adult and is still coming to terms with the trauma he endured at the overlook hotel when he was five years old, his mother wendy has passed away and now he is a chronic alcoholic , he finds a job as an orderly after attending AA meetings and gets back on the straight and narrow, meanwhile theres an evil cult in the midst called the ""true knot"" headed by a modern day witch called rose the hat played brilliantly by rebecca ferguson, this cult feeds off gifted childrens souls after abducting and murdering them, rose the hat discovers a girl with the shining gift and been relentless tries to persue her , the girl makes a connection with the adult doc as they have the same gift, danny is then lured into protecting the girl and with there powers combined they pick off members of the cult one by one, with rose still in pursuit of the girl, knowing the dangers danny takes the girl to the abandoned overlook hotel to lure the witch into a cauldron of evil.The movie does have certain flaws mainly character development ,we dont know much about the cult or the girl with the shine, and although ewan mcgregor is miscast in this as danny his performance is adequate, a good story with some intense horror scenes and the nostalgia at the end is quite exciting, you get see the evil spirits that graced the original in all its glory in a stunning blueprint of the overlook, the actors who play jack and wendy torrance and dick o halloran are excellent and mimic the original actors to aplomb, but the highlight is rebbecca ferguson as rose that hat, an excellent performance and probably the sexiest movie witch since michelle pfeiffer in the witches of eastwick.
The shining was always going to be an hard act to follow, and stephen king didnt like the original very much so this sequel had a lot to live up to and it pulls through compared to recent stephen king adaptations and other recent horror flicks, it has originality and nostalgia if nothing else.
Probably as good an effort as a horror sequel as was psycho 2 to hitchcocks 1960 classic !",Doctor Sleep
355,sme3,Two Films in One,6,3 December 2019,"Doctor Sleep attempts to adapt the novel that is a sequel to the novel The Shining, but it is also a sequel to the well-known 1980 Stanley Kubrick film adaptation of The Shining. Doctor Sleep, the film delivers a plot and tone more consistent with Stephen King's original intentions while while still attempting to be a sequel to a film significantly different from the novel. About two-thirds of this film feels like a serviceable adaptation of King's work while the other third is an adaptation of Kubrick's film. Depending on one's taste one part or the other is likely to be more effective. Enjoyment of this film may rest heavily on one's familiarity with a film that is almost 40 years old.",Doctor Sleep

It just felt too tame, like the script was only scratching the surface of something that could have been amazing if explored on a deeper level. When the film finished I felt really underwhelmed.
It did have some really nice moments though: I enjoyed the last 20 minutes or so when the film returned to the infamous ""Overlook Hotel"" and revisited the horrors from ""The Shining,"" was really nice to see it all again in a modern light; that alone, for me, made the film worth watching all the way through.",Doctor Sleep

What I did like though, was that the book extended the shining story through Dan Torrence and his shining and spinning the story a different way from the original. For the first two thirds the film absolutely covers that, and the feel of the book really comes through, despite some minor changes. Then the last third goes out on its own. In principle i didn't have an issue with that but turning into a retread of the shiningwas a mistake as it doesn't haveJack Nicholson or the terror of the original movie. Overall for the most part though this is a good adaptation of an interesting book..",Doctor Sleep

A beautifully shot masterpiece of fresh horror that was entertaining to watch.I will say that upon writing this review I have never seen The Shining. But nevertheless as a stand alone movie this was captivating from start to finish.With a very strong a well rounded cast such as the lead antagonist Rebecca Ferguson as Rose (Vikings) who In my opinion is the reason this movie is so successful with her performance one that could propel her into the Hollywood elite. Zahn McClarnon (Fargo, Bone Tomahawk) seems to always play a cool level headed baddie, a stereotype he fittingly is just born to play as Crow Daddy. And we get another strong performance from an A grade actor in Ewan McGregor who plays the lead protagonist Dan (The Island, Star Wars) who struggles to overcome his alcoholism and finally accept his gift. Also with promising performances from up and comers Emily Alyn Lind as Snakebite and Cliff Curtis as Billy.The movie is intriguing and fresh. We follow a cult called The Knot who seek out and hunt children with a special gift called the shine in the pursuit for eternal life.Overall a captivating film that I would highly recommend to those who love thrillers with horror elements and enjoy a good story to keep them thoroughly entertained .8/10",Doctor Sleep

While it does pay homage to Kubrick in a number of ways, such as in the color palette and the original music, it devolves into a super hero movie for most of its bloated nearly 2.5 hours. With that much time, why isn't the Doctor Sleep character thoughtfully built up? Why don't we learn more about the young girl who is really the lead protagonist? And what is the reason for the group of villains to exist in the first place? This film is not nearly as deep or artistic as The Shining, but it does provide for a fairly entertaining action experience.",Doctor Sleep
364,Raptorclaw155,More of a Supernatural Thriller than a Horror,7,11 November 2019,"As a film calling itself a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' most people would probably assume that it is a horror film. As it turns out, however it isn't a horror film as much as it is a Supernatural Thriller than a Horror film.This film attempts to recreate certain shots from Kubrick's 'The Shining' and some might see it as pandering to nostalgia while others not quite as much.What makes this film not a horror film is that there is a significantly higher amount of emphasis put on the powers that someone who ""shines"" have and what they are able to do with those powers. In an odd way, it is quite similar to the way the force is handled in the Star Wars prequels. The tone of this film is completely incongruent with 'The Shining' because of this. This might come from the Stephen King influence more than Kubrick, but I'm not sure.By far, the weakest aspect of this film is the first act. It has a lot of characters to establish and the way it does so can be a bit tonally confusing and difficult to follow with the surprising number of leaps through time it makes. I was worried during this part of the film as it began to seem like it was meandering. Luckily, the second act comes in and the film starts to pick up and start getting somewhere.The performances by the cast were well-done and they do a really good job at portraying their characters. This was especially true for Rebecca Ferguson's depiction of Rose the Hat. Her presence was always intimidating and sinister whenever she was on screen. Her performance was brilliant in this film. Ewan McGregor and Kyleigh Curran also put on great performances.Reflecting on this film, it does seem like it was written around the ending. I think the first act suffers because of this since so much of it is spent hastily establishing characters. But the thing I found interesting about the film was that, even though it did have its fair share of jump scares, I didn't come out of it thinking it was a horror film, but more so an action film. I found myself waiting in anticipation for the final showdown at the end of the film in the same way I would a Marvel movie. I don't think this is inherently a bad thing but I think if people are going into this film expecting a horror movie like The Shining, they will come out feeling incredibly dissatisfied.Aside from the first act and a couple of moments that felt unintentionally goofy, I was pleasantly surprised with how this film turned out. Some people might not be very big fans of the finale- especially those expecting this to be a horror film, but I thought the ending was strong within the context of a supernatural action film.",Doctor Sleep
365,peter7991,Entertaining horror flick,6,3 April 2021,"With the right expectations, this is an entertaining horror flick with nice throwbacks to Kubrick's original, while being unmistakably a Stephen King adaptation.

366,soundoflight,Kubrick it ain't,4,10 October 2020,"One of the most popular reviews here gushes about how this film pays homage to Kubrick, which I find to be quite strange because my own predominant thought while watching this was that it kind of backed up a dump-truck over the memory of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and proceeded to drive back and forth over it for over 2 hours. Everything that Kubrick brought to him film - style, artistry, visual mastery, an overall vision, was everything missing from ""Doctor Sleep.""Perhaps you consider it unfair to compare this film to ""The Shining,"" but they literally asked for it by melding the world of this film with the original, going as far as to re-shoot scenes from the original with the new, present-day actors. This is rarely an advisable strategy and it doesn't work here either.You have two basic options in a situation like this: (1) you can do a straight out re-make of the original or (2) you can make full blown sequel, something that might borrow something from the original, but also moves on from the original to create something new. I would argue that ""Doctor Sleep"" does neither and ends up in some kind of middling no-man's land.",Doctor Sleep
367,botrytis,Surprisingly good addition to the original where probably the worst parts were the nostalgia service ones,8,2 February 2020,"Shining isn't my favorite horror movie that's for sure but I appreciate all the effort put in making something gripping, haunting, psychedelic production, that wasn't about the cheap jumpscares and bland slasher movie solutions, not to mention its emphasis on ambiguity will keep it on the top tier horror movie list.This same ambiguity is represented here in the sequel, but also has the guts to explain some aspect of it that still keeps the whole concept in the mist making us ramble in unsureness with a bit of a direction.The tone, atmosphere resonates with the original, the visuals are haunting and well executed overall, yet there are some aspects of the cinematography that kinda had that B movie vibe to it compared to the Kubrick's wide, rennaissance-like perfection where every image seemed like a painting, an art.Acting is great, nothing to complain about, probably the girl protagonist was a bit wooden and reacted to really shocking happenings minimally.The 2/3 is a really powerful buildup to a not so satisfying climax. The last 20 minutes of the movie is more of a nostalgia/fan service where the well built up 2/3 of the film was kinda cheapened, betrayed. It seemed like the closer the creators got to the old, familiar places of the original movie the less sure they were about what they really want to do there, which is unfortunate as this should have been the moment of awesomeness, the answer to this story, but it got dragged down by the direction being out of focus.Overall it feels mostly a worthy sequel that builds on its predecessor and has many good ways to extend the story further, however some of the places where it really should have been powerful it wasn't unfortunately. Nonetheless it's a good installment that definitely needed to be seen by The Shining fans.",Doctor Sleep

I've never read either of the books (nor anything by Stephen King, egad), so am not privy to the decades-long foofaraw about King being unhappy with Kubrick's movie. I do know that Mike Flanagan (most recently of ""Haunting of Hill House"" on Netflix), who wrote, directed, and edited this one, really knows how to spin a spooky and suspenseful yarn. The run-time was 2.5 hours, but you never felt the time drag; it was engaging and engrossing the entire time and I never had to watch through my splayed fingers once. Ewan McGregor is great, as is Kyliegh Curran in her first role, and I'm in love with Rebecca Ferguson, who is fantastic here and who I mainly know through some small parts and will now need to seek out more.

The actor who portrayed jack nicholson is this movie didn't look anything like ""Johnny"" wish they could have used cgi instead. And for the woman who was supposed to be Wendy she did have some similarities but still the whole vibe throughout the entire film was pretty flat and boring. Chapter six was were I began to feel that this film however was related to the shining. The whole cult ""soul-sucking"" plot was boring and pretty much ruined the story for me.

Now the movie for me was kind of weird in the begining for me and was nothing at al as the shining was, but they had my intressed going as i wanted to se every peace put together.As for the final act everything comes together in an amazing conclusion with some reference from ""the shining"" that didn't make it like a follow up.. no but something new and at the same time it all mades sense for it's ""predecessor"", with a conclusion that i loved and i hope you as a non fan or fan of the shining Will do.This movie to me was better than the
shining and not by comparing them cause the shining was need to be for this film to even work, but how this movie created a something new to the genre and also solving the question we all had after ""the shining"" and much more!It was also just not some lame horror flick when dumb people do dumb decision and then later get's killed no this felt real and more like a psycological thriller!

377,Her-Excellency,"Surprisingly, better than expected.",8,4 November 2019,"The ever-beautiful Rebecca Ferguson and a favorite from the Fargo series, Zahn McClarnon team up to bring us some somewhat scary, but more so eerie/creepy moments in this adaptation of King's Doctor Sleep. For the most part, and with the help of Ewan McGregor who plays an alcoholic, grown-up version of The Shining's Danny Torrence, they pull it off.While Doctor Sleep is a rather drawn-out and, mostly, slowish-moving film, it still has enough to it, to not lose one's attention. The story-line is solid and engaging, although those unfamiliar with the book and looking for outright horror and gore, will find little satisfaction. There are a couple of scenes which can be construed as ""horrific"", but in my opinion, Doctor Sleep is not really a ""horror flick"" by definition. To me, it is more like an intense drama about good vs evil, with a couple of well-done 'end-of-life' scenes thrown in. :)What I most enjoyed about it, is that in this day and age where practically every story ever has already been made into a movie, this one's plot was just a bit off the beaten path and came across as slightly new and original in its approach, while still pretty seamlessly tying it in to the well-known classic: The Shining.If I had to add one con, it would be a somewhat minor one, in that, at times, the girl who plays Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who also possesses 'the shining', and who can communicate with Danny, delivers her lines in almost a stone-like manner, and at other times as if she is rapidly reading. It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.While good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle. In short, like the entire film itself, it is satisfying-enough to where one can feel as if watching it, was time well spent.",Doctor Sleep

Ewan McGregor is convincing, and the main vampire is a great actress too.However...after most of psychic vampires are defeated, there is almost nothing left to do. The scenario crumbles and this is just a guided visit of the Overlook hostel. The movie adds a lot of Shining references, and even recreates shots of Shining, and even includes some original Shining shots.

The Shining was a perfect film, the idea of a sequel didn't appeal to me in any way. However, just judging this movie on its own merit, it's very good. Despite the scary runtime I watched it in one sitting and it never really lost my attention. I must say though, all of The Shining movie references detracted from Doctor Sleep. One because you never want to make people think of a better movie while they're watching yours and two it didn't add anything to movie you're watching. I haven't read either of the books, but The Shining movie was about the overlook hotel, the ghost that inhabit it along with a possible curse on the caretaker. While the Doctor Sleep movie is about those with the shining powers and people who hunt them. So, to watch a good movie world build on its own to then climax using the lure and rules of another movie just felt forced, unnecessary and unsatisfying. It would have been much better staying in its own world and never including the overlook hotel. Also, the main child actor gave a good performance, but was written too much like a Mary Sue, there are some questionable character motivations that I wish was further explored and the two main protagonists each have someone close to them die and they just casually shrug it off like someone got their fast food order wrong.

This is the sequel to the film, not the book, just so you're aware. I read the sequel and this is similar, but definitely not exactly like the written sequel itself. The only aspect that I did not like was that there was much of the book story line left out in this movie, which would have helped it make more sense, had it been added. And that ""Rose The Hat"" character was just plain annoying the way it was portrayed. Toward the end of the film it becomes irritatingly predictable. However, if you loved The Shining, you'll love this too. There was this overhanging aura of ""horror cheese"" that one would expect in 80's campy horror films or the likes of 'Ouija' and 1987's 'Dolls' which were just plain stupid. I'm not knocking the director, because I loved 'Hush,' 'Oculus' and Flanagan's other work but this did have an overhanging aura of ""campy cheese."" I'm not sure this cheese had anything to do with him because Flanagan is great. I think it had to do with the musical score (or lack thereof) and a lack of atmospheric presence. The atmosphere in this film changes like the wind. In other words, 'The Shining' was dated yet timeless and atmospheric (think: The USA's versions of 'The Ring' and 'The Ring Two' as compared with 'Rings,' the third, extremely lacking installment. Two were atmospheric and stayed with the original characters and story line with a top notch score and the third installment was like a let down.

Clue from dreams. Finally i watched a good movie after almost 2 months. I went in to see this movie, mind you i had not read any reviews much less have seen any trailers. I was shocked by how good the movie was.This movie is really amazing. Great cinematograpy, great acting performance with great cgi effects. Thanks Mike Flanagan & Stephen King for making this kind of movie. I strongly suggest you guys to go watch it on the biggest screen you can get. I am sure that you wont regret what you pay for. I really liked it. Shine on Abra Stone !! Shine on !!",Doctor Sleep
391,jcullen_s,Doctor sleep,7,14 February 2020,I'm a bit disappointed but to be fair this movie was following the shining whatcha are hard shoes to fill but I was mostly happy with the finished product I mostly thought some of the characters were stale like Abra in this movie no offence to the actress was annoying and I didint like her character Ewan Is pretty soulless but it probably makes sense from all the stuff that poor Danny Torrence went through in his childhood I also didint really like the discount Danny Wendy and Jack Torrences in the flashback scenes and the part where both old Danny and jack meet could have been more emotional if you ask me alright now to the good stuff I felt interested in the story and I was never disinterested there was always something going on and I never felt like it needed to pick up the pace in some scenes and I felt the TrueKnots were really well adapted from the book and I found Rose intimidating that's something I really like another Steven King movie IT chapter 2 had some scenes like the ritual of chud that was normal in the book but to mainstream audiences was just stupid I felt they handèles all the wired Steven King stuff well the directing was also great thanks to Mike Flanagan who I've been rooting for ever sense I saw haunting of hill house and geralds game another Steven King adapted book I like the shots he does like when Danny's room is moving and it looks real trippy overall I thought the movie was good and servicable it could have been better but it could have been a lot worse this is a good recommendation for those who've seen the shining or like mike Flanagan horror or Steven King..... also where was that Bear thing when all those boxes opened up what's the deal with that,Doctor Sleep

""Doctor Sleep"" is certainly very stylish and well-directed; but it's length and attempt to cover so much ground left me exhausted. Based on the reviews, I was really looking forward to this one. However, in the rear-view mirror it strikes me as one of those films that successfully skipped like a rock across a large pond, but never left much of a ripple for this viewer.

Pretty pathetic.Then it's just a hodgepodge of ideas from other similar horror movies, poorly done. That might be kind of fun to watch, but it's just all so unpleasant, especially the scenes with children.Really this movie doesn't even deserve to be reviewed. It is beyond me why these good actors like Ewen McGregor and Bruce Green would in be a sorry, just to make money, crappy movie like this, much less how it got such good reviews.If you want to watch some good horror movies, try The Shining, A Quiet Place, Alien, Wolfen, The Thing ...",Doctor Sleep

But what really suprised me about doctor sleep is how unique it is, this movie doesn't rely on jump scare after jump scare or even shining call backs, but what makes this movie so unique is how it does it's own thing, yes the shining call backs are there and the 3rd act is definitely a full sequel to the shining and has the most call backs to the shining but for the rest of the movie it does it's own thing and it's own thing is just amazing and mind blowing and just fantastic.

398,Rifat_Rock_Don,Doctor Sleep - 👺👹,9,15 March 2020,"I didn't have a ton of expectations going into this movie but I thoroughly enjoyed The Shining (like much of the human population) so I was expecting a good continuation of the original story line. Overall I think Mike Flanagan was able to deliver. The way the movie was filmed and edited really exemplified a ty pical horror movie. Doctor sleep includes a constant mist in the settings, there are a lot of dramatic slow panoramic shots, and the music is eerie and impactful. T he acting is pretty decent but in my opinion Rebecca Ferguson absolutely shined as Rose the Hat. Ferguson put in so much emotion into her character and her expressions throughout the movie were just so unsettling, it was pure perfection. I didn't find Doctor Sleep to be very scary I might classify it as more thriller, there were a few jump scares and a few shots disgusted me but nothing really shook me to my core, which is fine. Overall as an avid fan of horror movies and King I enjoyed this movie a lot and might even say it's one of the best horror movies of the year.",Doctor Sleep

400,chilversedward,Very Pleasantly surprised,9,12 March 2020,"When I heard there was a film being made as a sequel or related film to the shining I couldn't really imagine it as being a good idea or possibly being any good. Other than Danny and the final scene there is no real connection to the shining. I was personally happy about that as the shining didn't need a sequel or could really have one imho.
I thought this film was great and seeing Danny as a grown up and expanding the concept of the shine worked really well and was all the reference it needed to the shining. I really enjoyed this film and I think fans of the shining won't feel any animosity to the film as it didn't mess with the shining at all. The story, the actors, the filming and the revisit to the overlook all made a good coherent entertaining movie and I would recommend this to anyone.
I haven't read the book so don't know how much it followed it or if the adaptation was faithful and to it. I think I read that Steven king rated it. I definitely want to read the book now after watching the film.",Doctor Sleep
401,kelvynchin,A well made and worthy sequel,8,9 November 2019,"Just caught this at the local cineplex. Wasn't expecting too much; sequels rarely do well, especially to a classic like Kubrick's. But this is indeed a worthy sequel to the original. After having made a couple of neat little horror films, this is a significant step up for director Mike Flanagan - a bona fide large scale Hollywood blockbuster. He uses all the Kubrickian tricks from the original - screeching and thumping score and ominous sound design , lots of overhead shots of cars on solitary roads, etc - to create a very atmospheric and malevolent mood, in service of a very different narrative to the original. This is not really a horror film per se, rather a solid thriller with supernatural overtones. I couldn't help feel a frisson of excitement as the movie slowly builds up to the climax which returns Danny Torrance to the now abandoned Overlook hotel. Typical Stephen King devices (like the boxes in the mind) are handled very well. Rebecca Ferguson is superb as the chief antagonist; Ewan McGregor is suitably mournful as the grown up Danny - bringing a strong sense of decency and emotional weight to the character. I really enjoyed this film - it was much better than the recent IT adaptations. Amazingly, this 2 1/2 hour film has very little slow spots - it moves briskly along, covers a lot of ground, and you can feel the malevolence of the atmosphere in every scene. Also nice to see the Twin Peaks ""Giant"" on the big screen again.",Doctor Sleep

It's almost like a parallel universe, one that has an amount of gifted beings, a bit like the Unbreakable/Split/Glass world, but this one follows on from one of the creepiest/classic horror's of all time.There are a few upsetting scenes in the film and it definitely captures the modern type of horror without so many 'scary' scenes. Visions, nightmares, anticipation, these all things that are linked between this and the King/Cubrick classic. When I seen there was a modern sequel to The Shining I didn't hold out much hope but this is definitely up there with the best horror films that have been made over recent years.The film is very well thought out and I really enjoyed it.The cat knows that it's time to go to sleep.

I actually watched 'The Shining' & 'Pet Cemetery,' on the same day as a kid, so needless to say, I was traumatized. 'Dr. Sleep,' is a slow burn that definitely is worth the wait. It doesn't get any deeper into what the 'Shining' is or how it develops, or even how these ""cannibals,"" started their mission of consumption, which is unfortunate. Compared to other recent horrors, this is a solid piece. You won't be blown away but, you won't be disappointed. The acting is top notch but when it comes to horror, sci-fiction in general, taking some over the top chances is what I love.

411,huntersmithx,Worthy of being the next Horror classic for this decade.,10,12 November 2019,"""Doctor Sleep"" is a terrific and satisfying film that works on its' own and as a follow-up to Stephen Kings' book ""The Shining"", which inspired the 1980 adaptation that has since been registered as a landmark Horror classic (don't go in expecting a straight forward sequel to the original).Director Mike Flanagan directs this film to near perfection, utilizing techniques that made his films prior Horror efforts successful while channeling Stanley Kubrick's old fashioned editing techniques and slow oozing tension. There's also award worthy cinematography from Michael Fimognari that might sadly go unnoticed.The whole cast is a sight to behold; including Ewan McGregor as adult Danny Torrance, and Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat sizzles the screen with charisma and humanity while being a frightening match for our leads. Not to be overlooked is newcomer Kyliegh Curran in a mature and profound performance as Abra Stone, makes for one of the best young protagonists I've ever seen in a Horror film.For those who've been burnt out on unwanted sequels and uninspired concepts from the Horror genre; there's no need to fear since Mike Flanagan and company resort to inspiration, emotion and tension to drive the story rather than just relying on cheap scares and nostalgia from the 1980 film to make a quick buck.

The villain is played extremely well and is also a difficult one to adapt in that it could easily have come off as silly but she did a wonderful job with being so inviting yet so completely evil at the same time. I thought early on that the child actor would be terrible but she was decent overall. My only issue was the heavily changed ending. I didn't see the need for the drastic change and it completely changes the nature of the story for me. But if you can look past the changes the movie overall was quite good.

How many more films do we need to see using a loud heart beat as a scare devise. The sadism here is so over the top ,especially where children are concerned.

The Family, the job interview, the tour at the hotel, the stories, so many it is hard to count. This one has a connection because Dani is here but the story is quite far away from what I thought it would be, I enjoyed the movie but again, it vould have been so mucch better if the producers had made more connections and a better background than what was shown on this one.I like it, no doubt, I would recommend fans to watch this one but do not rise your expectations so much, the original one is not to be beat by any movie soon.

Making a movie that's on the same quality as a Kubrick movie is a high bar to cross, I get it. But they could still try and get at least the atmosphere right. But this movie doesn't even try. Instead it is actually a cheap spin off with more of supernatural thriller stuff than horror. I wouldn't have been surprised if this one was made by marvel studio.The scenes are hastily shown, unlike the Shining where they took time to set up a scene and show stuff rather than tell directly. There's no ambiguity. The dialogues suck. It's just spoon feeding. 'Steam'. Seriously, 'steam'? Couldn't they at least put in some other name for that thing other than this corny name, 'steam'. Glad, they didn't call it water vapour. It's like they didn't edit the name after the first draft.They were trying to put in so much of stuff into the movie that the movie ends up being too long. They didn't have an idea what all to leave out from the book. So many scenes like the one where the Hat lady recruits the new girl could've been cut out. Some scenes that tell us about Danny's alcoholism could've been reduced.They just tried to turn this into a superhero franchise.What's with casting some lookalikes in the iconic characters of Shining? Why even bother bringing those characters back. Only Dick Holloran's character has some importance. But then, even his presence is for too long. His lines, acting, dialogue delivery, all these things are not even close to what we saw in Shining. Was there even a point with Danny talking with his father in the Overlook? That was nothing but fan service. Coming to fan service, the third act is one big unneeded fan service.The plot was somewhat interesting in the second act. But then soon it went into a generic path.Don't believe the hype. This is just like the countless franchise attempts they are doing nowadays that caters to a younger audience.",Doctor Sleep

425,Deathstryke,"Childish, simplistic and daft - not made for adults.",3,3 November 2019,"It makes sense that Stephen King was more happy about this film than the original. Tonally and aesthetically it has more in common with 'It' and the recent crappy sequel than Kubrick's film. In other words, it looks like most of King's writing reads - CGI laden pop-ghoul fantasy for tweens.It follows Danny as a middle-aged man plagued by horrific memories of The Overlook hotel, who discovers others with the gift of 'the shining', and those who would use it with nefarious intent...In my opinion, Kubrick's direction greatly elevated the source material of The Shining and gave it a psychological gravity and intense foreboding that is just not present in Doctor Sleep, where the simplistic dialogue, snappy pacing, bright colour palette and over-used CGI effects made me feel like I was watching an episode of Supernatural, but with a bigger budget, Goosebumps, but with cuss words and gore.If The Shining could be criticized for being too vague and open-ended, then Doctor Sleep is guilty of infantilizing its audience with wide-eyed 'here comes the aeroplane' spoon-feeding. Characters finish every sentence by spelling out exactly what they're feeling and what they plan to do. There's no room for the audience to use their brains, or interpret things at any stage.One can argue that it is wrong and unfair to compare the two films given the uniqueness of Kubrick's vision, but Doctor Sleep invites these comparisons by constantly referencing The Shining in flashbacks, in musical motif and by also relying on much of Kubrick's imagery to pedal its cheap scares.
In the finale, The Overlook hotel is revisited, but the manner in which this happens turns the entire thing into a crass theme park ride, with familiar ghosts popping up here and there like cardboard cutouts waiting to be knocked down with pellet gun. There is also a ridiculous 'Buffy-esque' fight sequence where a supernaturally charged Rebecca Ferguson takes out an axe-wielding Ewen McGregor with martial arts.It's risible stuff.",Doctor Sleep

It followed the book pretty much, which I liked but what disappointed me was at the end of the movie when they killed Danny Torrance in The Overlook in the fire. Seems to me that this movie and the Shining kinda followed the books and yet they didn't, because it was at the end of the Shining where the Overlook exploded and caught fire and in the book Doctor Sleep, Danny lived and he learned that he and Abra's mother were brother and sister but they didn't do that in this movie.

Also, it wasn't frightening or horrific, really, at least compared to modern horror classics. But that's totally ok! Like, the scares are on par with something like True Blood or an HBO mini-series. But again, that's totally okay; not everything has to be crazy terrifying.Now onto the good: the acting is great, especially from McGreggor, and Ferguson holds her own and is a layered and complex bad guy. They did great. But the biggest surprise was how good of a direct sequel to The Shining this was. Now, right off the bat, you NEED to see The Shining before this (if you haven't) for it to make sense. These two movies are glued together, especially this one. You won't see catch the brilliance if you haven't seen the original Kubrick film. Helps if you've read the book, but that's not necessary.

430,nooshie-33142,Emotional and heartfelt - best King adaptation for years!,9,26 January 2020,"The Shining is probably one of my favourite books and Kubricks film, one of my favourite all time movies. I was really worried when I heard a movie was being made of another great King novel, Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining. I shouldn't have worried as this is an emotional and heartfelt telling of a fantastical dark tale with strong acting and wonderful special effects. Not too much h CGI, just enough to take you into magical world of good v evil. Kudos to Ewan McGregot who plays little Danny from The Shining all grown up. This is probably his best ever role. Believable, heart tugging performance which is the centre of this tale. It's not a straight up horror film. I would say it's a fantasy drama of the highest quality and one of the best cinematic imaginings of Kings work. All the cast are good and give sold support but McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson as the good and evil around which the plot revolves are both excellent. As an homage to the book and the original Kubrick classic, this ticks all the boxes. The final hour set in the most scary building ever to be written about, is truly chilling. The Overlook Hotel comes alive as our protagonists enter the spooky halls, in one of the most striking scenes I've seen for years. It send shivers up your spine, literally! Special note to the cameo role by Henry Thomas who fills Jack Nicholson's shoes very well in one of the most unnerving performances I've seen for quite a while. He's not on screen long, but he makes it count! Highly recommended for all fans of King, fans of the original movie and anyone who wants to see an engrossing story, beautifully told. I would yet again say that if you're expecting gore and jump scares, this is not for you. The onky complaint I had was the casting of Kyleigh Curran as Abra Stone. She's such a prominent character in the movie, but the little actress, although very pretty to look at, delivered her lines like someone reading from a script - a more experienced child actor with a better emotional range would have fitted the bill better. Also Abra in the book is Danny's real niece and is blonde and blue eyed. In the movie, Abra is mixed race and no relation to Danny. I'm a purist, and like actors to be cast with reference to their appearance and relationship in the book. Small gripe in an otherwise fantastic movie.",Doctor Sleep

432,HardLight,Self-pleasure by a bitter author who doesn't like that someone made his material better.,4,30 October 2021,"Said to myself a while back that I wouldn't watch this again until after I'd read the Shining and I finished the Shining yesterday, so I spent this evening watching Dr Sleep and there's really a lot to talk about in this so hitting the spoiler tag now so I can say it without a problem.This film is an insult to the idea of the Shining by Kuberick and it's the last gasp by an author who has become so old and bitter at not being seen as the genius he thinks he is that he has taken it out on the person who made the best piece of adaptation of his work ever put to screen. (Yes I'm saying the Shinings better than Greel Mile and Shawshank, I'll explain later)For years now Stephen King has gone on and on about how Stanley Kuberick's The Shining is an insult, how the portrayals of the characters are horrible and how it's racist sexist misogynistic tripe that shouldn't be seen by anyone.Because Kubericks' the Shining does something that the book version doesn't, it makes the story impressively interesting and a look into the mind of psychosis and isolation.For those who don't know or won't read the book (don't it's not worth your time) King's Shining is about a haunted hotel that gets a guy drinking again and then everything blows up, I'm not kidding, ghosts get Jack to drink again and he gets possessed by ghosts who then hunt and try and kill people, that's the masterpiece that King is upset over being ""ruined"".Why am I saying this in the review of Dr Sleep?Well unlike the book version of story, this version sits neatly in the universe of Stanley Kuberick and it takes the story of Stanley's Shining and says ""gonna just remove that heart and put in a glass of whiskey instead.""Almost all of this movie is window dressing for the final part, which is set at the Overlook again and meant to ""course correct"" the ""mistakes"" in the other movie.As in Stanley Kuberick's the Shining there's no proof that anything supernatural is actually going on, no proof that Danny Shines, no proof that there's ghosts, no proof that anything is happening.Except that 3 people are losing their minds in a hotel over the winter because they're isolated and alone.But now with King's written version of this movie (of which he appears in - strange too as the Shining is the only movie King doesn't cameo in) all of that has been white washed. There WERE Ghosts in the overlook, the True Knot were eaten by them, the REAL THREAT is Alcohol and not isolation and moving away from other people so you lose your mind.This film is an insult and it's a tacky thing to do for a man who got more famous because of a better writer seeing the outline for his stupid story and making something better out of it.Don't watch this, stay away from it as it's a bad joke.(funniest thing is that King embodies every element of Sober Jack Torrance with how he has taken the success of a better writer)",Doctor Sleep

I understand that its impossible to recast the original actors but with CGI etc they could have superimposed faces and used voice actors etc better than how it's done in Doctor Sleep. Instead the film feels like a very good story wrapped in a TV quality recast.

But having finally seen ""Doctor Sleep"" I'm won over: this movie is an absolute blast. It isn't perfect by any means - it's maybe 20 minutes too long and the ending didn't fully work. But I was blown away by the incredible performances (especially from Ewan McGregor and Kyliegh Curran), engaging story, and the flawless incorporation of Kubrick's visual style into a fresh and enjoyable sequel.""Doctor Sleep"" does what every follow-up needs to do: it builds upon the world established by the first movie and goes off in new directions while staying true to the spirit of its predecessor. So much effort was put into developing the original characters while updating them for a new generation without becoming a retread of old material. By the end, I truly cared about Dan Torrance even more than I did while watching the original, and I came to love new characters just as much. In particular, Rebecca Ferguson plays a great villain who's menacing without going over the top like many horror antagonists. Also, look for Henry Thomas (Eliot from ""E.T."") in a surprise role that I won't dare spoil.""Doctor Sleep"" shouldn't have been this good. But it is.

As a result I did not go and see it at the Cinema. Biggest mistake I ever made.This is an amazing movie. And really does feel like it warrants being called a sequel to Kubricks The Shining and a film on par with one he would have made if still around.The only thing I would possibly change was I loved the start with Young Danny and Wendy.

The last Stephen King movie The Dark Tower was horrible but Stephen King said he liked it. The way to adopt a Stephen King book is to take the core material and then make it better. Like Shawshank. Stephen King's earlier works were better, like Christine, Cujo, etc. At some point all his horror novels began to feel the same so I stopped reading his books. I might be wrong. I'm referring to his 90's novels.Haunting of Hill House was sooo bad and directed by this same director Mike Flanagan.",Doctor Sleep

I wouldn't consider it a direct sequel, rather as something that stands on its own, while referencing the classic here and there. Rebecca Ferguson is captivating as a villain and a worthy adversary to all those who shine.

442,abcizdaman,A Great Follow Up... but Very Different,9,14 July 2020,"Just to get this out of the way I would've rated this a 10 but didn't much appreciate them showing a boy getting killed like they did. Very distasteful in my opinion. They should've just made it play as a 'known' instead of showing the scenes and sounds all the way through.
Anyway, this movie was very different from the original in 1980 and not just because it was 40 years later. If it wasn't for the playback scenes of the old hotel and the end being in the hotel, you would've thought it was it's own movie. It did have the special abilities and the old cook from the hotel too... and of course Danny. The movie just felt VERY different from the original in story. Not that that was bad, just different. Anyway aside from the boy being killed like he was this movie had you very intrigued and wondering what was going to happen next. It mostly triggered around a band of 'shining' soul stealers. Great special effects and 'shining' skills as well as others' skills too. I could've done without the heartbeat sounds though. Think there were at least 1,000. I don't recall the original being as annoying with that. It does set the mood though. I like how they found an actress to sound just like the old Mrs. Torrance. And the skill Danny had to lock up the old ghosts was interesting. I personally think Danny died in the fire at the end and was tagging along with the girl like the old cook did for him. That's just my opinion. Wow, 40 years in between. They did good though. There's been other Stephen King part 2s that weren't so great. Anyway this is a definite must see in a day and age where movies seem to have lost their touch and imagination.",Doctor Sleep

445,Millennialprince,Doctor Sleep,8,18 February 2020,"Wow, this felt more like an X-Men movie than Dark Phoenix. This movie feels less like a horror film and feels more like a dark superhero movie and I dug that about it. The only chilling moment for me is when the True Knot killed Bradley Trevor. Everything else is standard horror scenes you've seen in countless other horror movies. This movie works best when it's trying to be its own thing as opposed to a sequel to The Shining. Although the Shining homages are nice, it feels more like fan service. This movie is also elevated by strong performances in the cast. Ewan McGregor makes for a great hero as Dan Torrance and Kyleigh Curran is great as his ally Abra Stone. Rebecca Ferguson is also great as Rosie the hat who makes for a very detestable villain. Now that I think about it, you can almost look at this as the modern day retelling of Dracula with Dan Torrance as Van Helsing and Rosie the Hat as Dracula. And you know for a 45 million dollar budget, this film feels very epic in places. Probably the most awe inspiring sequence for me is when Rosie astral projects over the city to find Abra. That sequence was visually impressive and I tip my hat off to Mike Flanagan for pulling that scene off. The subsequent mental battle between Abra and Rosie was also fun to watch. And trust me when I say Rosie's comeuppance in the third act was fun to watch. So in conclusion, if you want to see Dan Torrance and Abra Stone battle energy vampires, Doctor Sleep is the movie for you.",Doctor Sleep
446,henferdeline,Apt sequel to 'The Shining'!,6,26 January 2020,"I must confess I had awful expectations regarding this movie.
The Shining is to date one of the best books by Stephen King and by far the best adaptation to the big screen any of his works ever had - so the sequel was bound to come short of it, given King isn't anywhere as good as he once was and that the times now forbid certain scenes to be shown...The movie turned out ok despite all that!The 'empty ones' are a conceivable addition to the environment (though they should have been less conspicuous, of course), the big shiner black girl was a nice touch.
Danny being a recovering alcoholic was perhaps a bit too forceful - and they didn't truly need it to bring them all back to the Outlook Hotel.

453,mulcahyj-07545,Stunning adaptation of a book I thought impossible to adapt to screen..,9,28 December 2020,"The first thing people may ask before viewing is complicated. Do you need to have seen The Shining? Do you need to have read The Shining? Is it a good option to read Doctor Sleep first? A quick answer is I think no to all. You may still find this film stunning. To totally appreciate it? Well these are from my personal thoughts. But if you walked in with little or no knowledge of the latter options you would probably find it a disturbing and frightening film with a tight plot. It has a long running time but there is a lot to cram in to the film but it doesn't feel that way as the story moves fast and genuinely surprising and frightening? Like horror movies? That is enough in my opinion. Ewan MacGregor is very good and holds the movie together. The child actress is perfect, she could have a massive film career ahead. Rebecca Ferguson is stunning. She manages to pull off being beautiful and in her own way some how a caring one but obviously deep down outright evil and vile. A stunning performance. Book adaptations can be a mess. This is not in anyway. It's compressed content in a long running time is still gripping. And as I say disturbing, frightening and gripping. A 9/10 pushing seriously to a 10/10 and does not require any previous watching of The Shining or having to read The Shining or Doctor Sleep. This is a horror movie. And a damned good one.For me I read The Shining before I watched the film. I remember feeling incredibly disappointed but still appreciated Kubrick's loose interpretation. If I had watched The Shining first I would have appreciated Kubrick's work more. It is well known King didn't like the film. I understand why. But his book as brilliant as it was would have been almost impossible to put to film then. Or now really. You could try watching the TV movie mini series. If you do give me your impression of it. I watched thirty minutes and switched it off. But apparently King was happy of it as it put more of his story to screen. But there should be no real debate on this. The Shining move is one of Stanley Kubricks best pieces of work. A true classic. The Stephen King book as a true classic piece of horror literature. Can I advise you which to experience first. No. The both great pieces of work which will give you a great piece of work. I was disappointed reading the book first then viewing the film second. But they are my opinions. We all appreciate art differently. You may unlike me like reading the book first? We all take things in a similar manner or completely different. So don't follow my opinion. Just consider it. For those who have already experienced it in the same way as I you may and a lot of you feel totally differently.
Such is life.As for Doctor Sleep I read the book first. I thought it was one of King's classics. I didn't think it could be put to film. But they have brilliantly here. The film is not a carbon copy. Just brilliant in its own way. It manages to reference the film version and the book version of The Stand and the core of the book version of Doctor Sleep to create a unique piece of work. It does have a long running time but the story displayed needs it. A rushed version would have been awful. It mixes slow and fast pacing and the references unique between the book and film version excellently. Depending on whether you have only watched or read the movie version of The Shining it doesn't matter as they just blend in beautifully. The advantage of read both sources of books and film version of The Shining as nice as they are, I loved those, are not a prequisite in any combination to viewing this. I found it so disturbing and unsettling I watched it in two halves. Not because it was too long but I found the content hard to take.So there you go. No matter of your knowledge or non at all of The Shining you would find this an outstanding horror film. I would even find the writer/director taking on a version of The Stand safe in his hands and I can not give it a higher recommendation by me!",Doctor Sleep

Some scenes are made very upsetting and intense by effective background music. For example, the movie managed to keep the night scenes eerie, foggy, yet still bright enough for audience to follow what's going on, with the smart use of car headlights.I'm happy that the director avoided the 2 most common pitfalls of horror flicks: bad editing/ shaky camera/ poor lighting, and overdone audio visual shocks.Inevitably, the hotel is featured in the movie as suggested by trailers, but the director kept the flashbacks minimal, and remained focused on this movie's characters, so I didn't feel like watching The Shining all over again.",Doctor Sleep

The movie's cinematography is outstanding. Although it doesn't get close to rivialing it, the fact that it's a sequel to a movie with the best cinematography in history and still stands on its own as a beautiful looking movie is incredible. Doctor Sleep serves as a fantastic love letter to its predecessor, if you're a fan of Stanley Kubrick's classic, this movie will make you very happy. Finally, I have to mention the ending.

(Not saying it is a bad movie but for me OTT at times and the leads were totally miscast). The mini series tried to address that and be more faithful to the book and worked, at times. Doctor Sleep straddles between the two and in some ways tries to please the movie fans (who have may not read the book) and that's where it disappoints. The movie is moving along and building then suddenly we begin to get reenactments from the movie (like a SNL / James Corden moment(s) ) and they just don't work.

471,Don_Falone1985,Outstanding,10,14 November 2020,"Dark, disturbing and a truly brilliant adaption from Mike Flanagan, who's beginning to develop a reputation as one of the best horror directors around. It's a sequel to the superb masterpiece The Shining and based once again on the Stephen King novel. It features the now adult Danny Torrance played brilliantly by Ewan Mcgregror. Whilst, this film is very different to The Shining, it does provide some excellent nostalgic moments and throwbacks to the original, which is done superbly by the director. It's a different take on the 1st film though, so if you go into this film with that mindset, you will truly appreciate what Flanagan is trying to achieve her. Shout out to Rebecca Ferguson who plays the main villain in the movie and is absolutely terrifying as The hat. A truly mesmerising performance, but equally terrifying to boot. She nails that role and despite her beautiful looks, it actually really works. All in all, a brilliant horror movie, with a touch of nostalgic undertones and an excellent cast make this a really good standalone film, let alone a sequel. Highly recommended to any fan of The Shining.",Doctor Sleep

476,burkholdermicah,From IT: Chapter Two now... THIS Movie!!,10,31 October 2019,"The tragedy of the Torrance family is one of the most beloved horror stories ever told. The Shining is one of Stephen King's biggest hits and Stanley Kubrick's adaptation has beguiled viewers for decades. But these two versions of the story have always been seen as very different sides of the same coin, as Kubrick's film deviates majorly from King's novel. That's what made the prospect of adapting Doctor Sleep, King's 2013 sequel to The Shining, so tricky - how do you stay true to one without betraying the other? It turns out, you get Mike Flanagan (The Haunting of Hill House, Ouija: Origin of Evil), a modern master of ghost stories; combined with a great cast, and a whole heap of cool psychic set-pieces, and it just works. Most of Doctor Sleep delights with the new material it brings to this chapter of Torrance family history - its only real moments of weakness come when overindulging in Kubrick's vision of the story.After a prologue dealing with the direct aftermath of The Shining, Doctor Sleep picks up with an adult Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor), an alcoholic drifter who uses booze to dull both his horrific memories and his powers. We see flashes of his life back when he was drinking, but the story quickly moves on to follow a years-sober Dan, using his shine in a limited way to help hospice patients pass on peacefully to the after-life. Early on in his journey to sobriety, Dan becomes aware of Abra Stone (Kyleigh Curran), a young girl who shines even more powerfully than him. Dan's not the only one to notice this talent, though: The True Knot, a cult of quasi-immortal hunters that feed on people who shine, pick up on Abra's power as well. The story, which spans decades and focuses on multiple characters, is a total departure from The Shining's claustrophobic setting. That narrative breathing room gives Doctor Sleep a lot of opportunities to do its own thing and when it's forging its own path, the movie rarely falters.Doctor Sleep is one of the scariest Stephen King adaptations in years, thanks in large part to the formidable True Knot. In contrast to The Shining's villain, which despite working through Jack was really the Overlook Hotel itself, Doctor Sleep benefits and stands apart by having physical antagonists with more concrete goals and methods for Dan and Abra to battle. And it is clear that they will do anything to win, brutally murdering children in the film's most hard-to-watch scenes. One of these minor characters is actually played by a surprisingly high-profile child actor, his presence distracting until he's tasked with believably screaming his way through a very R-rated death.Writer/director Mike Flanagan's eye for bringing metaphysicality to life on film has long been one of his greatest assets and it serves him well again here. Doctor Sleep doesn't quite approach the singular sense of unreality in Kubrick's film, but Flanagan's methods of visually communicating what the Shining is and how it can work through its various hosts provide a source of constant unease and danger. The twists and turns Flanagan mines out of that power both deepen our understanding of what it means to shine and keep the film interesting throughout its considerable 2 hours and 33 minutes.Through its lofty scenes of psychic warfare and intense character beats, Doctor Sleep is anchored by a wealth of strong performances. Ewan McGregor's Dan Torrance is a heartbreakingly damaged man, torn between helping Abra fight the True Knot and keeping the ghosts of his past locked away. The weight of Dan's trauma is especially easy to sympathize with here because we know exactly how horrific those ghosts are. Kyliegh Curran holds her own as gifted teen Abra, at her most effective in her confrontations with the True Knot, when she's tasked with flipping between scared kid and supernatural warrior in the blink of a creepy, milky eye. The standout of the cast is Rebecca Ferguson's villain, Rose the Hat. As the leader of the True Knot, Ferguson imbues Rose with a malice and ferocity that make her a terrifying foe. In her best moments, Ferguson rivals the unhinged madness Jack Nicholson brought to Jack Torrance.It's when Doctor Sleep drifts away from evocation to straight-up recreation that Flanagan starts to overplay his hand. To be clear, not all of Doctor Sleep's Shining love goes amiss. Scenes in which shot composition, edits, and sound cues are reused feel like rewarding nods to Kubrick's Shining. Even Carl Lumbly's brief appearance as Dick Hallorann ends up being effective, with Lumbly giving us just enough Scatman Crothers to make this feel like the kindly Hallorann we know without feeling like a full-on impersonation. The same can't be said about Alex Essoe's Wendy Torrance. Essoe doesn't quite pull off the physical or vocal qualities of Shelley Duvall's iconic performance, so visions of her ordeal at the Overlook, itself staggeringly recreated, have a bizarre quality of documentary re-enactment.Yes, The Overlook has a part to play here, and again, it's a mixed bag. The artistry of these scenes is undeniable, with the sets painstakingly recreating Kubrick's Overlook, and often being similarly photographed too. But the scenes which take place at the hotel suffer from some egregious moments of incongruity, like when a character not present for The Shining's events witnesses an iconic scare from that film with bemusement rather than horror. That dissonance continues when one of the Overlook's familiar minions appears in a scene that alternately serves an important thematic function while also being one of Doctor Sleep's least successful recreations of the past. While it goes a little overboard, Doctor Sleep's third act does deserve credit for how it reconciles King's novel and Kubrick's film. It's clear throughout that Flanagan has an equal respect for both versions, evident in his clever repurposing of beats from King's Shining that Kubrick changed.When it's focusing on the new things it brings to the table, Doctor Sleep is consistently terrifying, visually impressive, and soulful in equal measure. Though it may get a little heavy-handed and tonally confused in its reverence for Stanley Kubrick's Shining in the homestretch, the vast majority of the film succeeds in using the Torrance family's pain to tell a story of coming to terms with the past. No matter which version of The Shining you prefer, fans of both will be finding things to enjoy about Doctor Sleep forever. And ever. And ever. And ever.",Doctor Sleep
477,maidwell-45616,The perfect book adaptation,9,17 December 2019,"I can understand some people not getting this movie or wanting a paint by numbers shining sequel but for those who go in with an open mind (and for those who aren't squeemish) this movie is astonishing.

478,kaneeddy,A decent but somewhat unnecessary sequel,7,14 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is a strange film to me, there are elements that it nails and then there are parts when i'm questioning why make a film that follows up a horror classic in the shining. Ewan Mcgregor gives a solid performance in the film, answering the question of what Danny Torrance is like when hes older after the events of the shining. The film does an excellent job of not just appreciating Kubrick's work but instead enhances it making you fully appreciate how great of a director he was and how good the shining actually is. This movie to me was a little more scarier then what the shining was to me which some would see as a positive, and you can see a lot of effort has gone into this film and it really tries hard to not just be a cash grab ripping off the name to make money.However, Doctor Sleep falls into some traps that a modern blockbuster type of film does by spelling everything out for you which in a lot of movies that's fine but the shining was a film that left things up to your interpretation, that to me is why it is considered a classic because people find new things to find in that film to this day because of Kubrick's directing. This feels more by the numbers and I was a little disappointed that it spells everything out. Also the shining is full of iconic moments and some masterful cinematography. When this film tries to do the same its just replaying those old shots that Kubrick used, and doesn't bring anything new to the table in that regard, and makes me wonder why make a shining sequel film and play it so safe. It also has a kind of superhero element to it with villains which I found really weird for this type of film. We see a storyline between an antagonist vs the protagonist so many times a year which feels like a shame because the shining was such a innovative film.Overall I did enjoy doctor sleep and the experience that it brought but I think if you're going to follow up a Kubrick film you need to take some risks of your own and i think how safe it is holds the film back a little and makes this film forgettable compared to the shining.",Doctor Sleep

Don't go in expecting jump scares, it's not that kind of film but it's one of those films that hook you in right from the get go. The cast is amazing, especially Rebecca Ferguson and the child actors. There is also a lot of Shining homage in this film, for fans of the original. There is one particular scene that I can never forget which is about a character entering a building by flying into the window, I have never seen anything like that before, but boy was that effective! Hats off to Mile Flanagan, you did it again. This is easily the best films I've seen this year and immensely satisfying too, like a good buffet if sorts. Don't miss it watch it on the big screen.

482,greggwager,Monster Mashup,10,23 November 2019,"Writer, director, and editor Mike Flanagan obviously had a whim in his head that bothered him. Thankfully, he didn't shoo it away like the rest of us might've and kept developing it before courageously committing it to film. Add typical mechanisms of movie sequels that may make the final plot for Doctor Sleep sturdier than its premise, but what prevails is unchartered territory in slow-cooking terror and remarkably intelligent acting for such a modestly budgeted horror film.Flanagan probably surmised that making a sequel to a Kubrick film can't ever be the best of ideas. There's an unflappable sense of ""we are not worthy."" After all, filmmakers doting on their master end up doing downright dumb things (such as bending over backwards in a sequel to exonerate Hal the computer).Less sequel than new concoction borrowing from both King and Kubrick, Doctor Sleep introduces diverse characters that wonderfully keep us on our toes. Lookalikes represent the old characters reduced here to still compelling cameos.Praise for Ewan McGregor for taking on an acting project such as this, which requires insightful acceptance of all its bizarre premises. His adult version of Danny Torrance requires him to immediately recognize what ""shining"" can and can't do, while not upstaging all the tricky and creepy goings-on he encounters. He stoically conveys the hodgepodge without ever confusing us.I also thoroughly enjoyed Kyliegh Curran as psychic savant Abra Stone, who confidently balances teen ingénue with intrepid magic warrior. Above all, Rebecca Ferguson's character, billed as ""Rose The Hat,"" ranks up there with all the legendary movie monsters I have ever seen: beautifully seductive, but never a doubt as to her evil (i.e., all the makings of a popular action figure).Aside from these lead roles, the acting support from many of the lesser roles was downright astonishing: ever-reliable Cliff Curtis gives us a sweet and humble version of Danny's loyal buddy; Emily Alyn Lind sizzles in her own combination of beauty and evil, not to mention angry youth; Zahn McClarnon meticulously works his ghoulish persona and trimmed beard into the menacing ""Crow Daddy""; while Carl Lumbly channels Scatman Crothers with eerie but fascinating mimicry (or perhaps a little help from CGI).Scary movie aficionados know who they are and have a high tolerance for violence and gore. Doctor Sleep has painful moments to watch, but in our own twisted way, we have to admire something that makes us think this way and works ideas until they are just right--or marvelously wrong.",Doctor Sleep
483,abhijith-alpha,Doctor Sleep is neither a compelling drama nor a Hollywood horror movie,6,13 December 2019,"Doctor Sleep feels like an attempt to ride on the coattails of Stanley Kubrick's classic The Shining (1980). That feeling is the big problem with this movie.A research on Google shows that Doctor Sleep is based on author Stephen King's novel of the same name, released in 2013. The intention of the director was to create a faithful adaptation of the book. Apparently, King did not like Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining. But cinematically, it was a masterpiece and rightly has its place in movie history. So the director has to pay attention to the fans of the movie as well, which creates conflict in the direction and toe of the movie. The movie moves slowly, building characters, but this happens in fits and spurts, with a time jump in between. The two time jumps, in my opinion, were done slightly erratically, especially the second one. The development of some characters fell by the wayside, which is an issue with such jumps. The final act of the movie, which occurs in the infamous Overlook Hotel from The Shining, is everything falls apart, where the director finally loses his grip on the threads. In the end, it's a movie caught between being a sequel to The Shining, a faithful adaptation of the novel and the director's effort to balance both.The acting is good, overall. Ewan McGregor does some acting after a long time, putting in a sympathetic performance as a man trying to recover from the deep trauma of spending time as a kid in the Overlook Hotel. Kyleigh Curran shows some range as Abra, someone who 'shines' brighter than anyone so far, and has to learn to cope with her abilities. Some of her character development has been cut down in the film, for narrative speed. The same goes for Emily Alyn Lynd, whose Snakebite Andi starts off as promising, yet the development never takes off. Rebecca Ferguson plays a character that should be menacing on paper, yet the onscreen version never portrays this woman's danger. Zahn McClarnon, who was the MVP of season 2 of Westworld, plays Crow Daddy, who extracts enough from his character with the limited screen time.The music is minimal; the direction is muted, only coming to life in the big, supernatural moments, which was a nice touch. Otherwise, this is half a commercial Hollywood horror movie, and half a supernatural drama.RATING 6.5/10",Doctor Sleep
484,Yvie81,Vampires sniff 'life steam' these days??,3,26 January 2020,"At first I thought how could they make something that's thát far away from the quality of The Shining movie, but then I read it's actually an adaptation from another Stephen King novel he wrote in 2013. Well I just read the summary of that book, and I don't know what's worse...his bookversion (some things were changed in the movie, especially the ending) or this film adaptation! I hold Mike Flanagan very high but he should have left this book the way it was: a book. The amount of subtility and tension he managed to create in The Haunting of Hill House is in serious contrast to what he pulled off in this film. I felt like I was watching a weird mixture of a vampire film (except the vampires in this one sniff up the 'steam' of dying paranormal kids as if they're totally getting high on drugs...which in itself looked pretty ridiculous I have to say!), X-Men (their abilities more reminded me of the mutants in X-Men), and some elements of Hill House and The Shining movie. But those elements of The Shining only seem to have been added to sort of try to give some sense to the story...which just doesn't seem to work out at all really!
As for the cast: I felt Rebecca Ferguson was totally miscasted as the 'evil queen'. She's not a bad actress, but she just doesn't look evil enough. She kind of reminded me of a 70's hippy that was desperately looking for a good joint! Ewan McGregor was meh in this movie. Definitely not his best role, but decent enough for the script he had to work with. The only one that made a real impression on me was the lead actress Kyliegh Curran who played Abra.
Oh and who the hell thought it was a good idea to make Henry Thomas look like Jack Nicholson for this film??
I read Stephen King was happier with this film adaptation than with Kubrick' s version of The Shining...which basically only proves to me his best days are definitely over!
Anyway, I just really hope Flanagan will find his mojo back for the second season of the 'the haunting of' series!",Doctor Sleep
485,davidjaldred,It ain't Kubrick but...,8,13 March 2020,"The plot is good - and it's pretty grim; Every single one of the actors gives top-notch performances, and the actors playing 'heritage' characters were integrated quite flawlessly but not slavishly. Even the kids were great little actors, meaning full marks all round to the casting director. I think the most onerous tasks befell the actors who were meant to fill the shoes worn by those original actors, but they did really well, avoiding impersonation whilst still acting convincingly and continuing those character's stories. The score is effective, yet it remains suitably background music apart from when it utilises the old familiar theme. The storytelling is a bit loose because it's a different kind of story; there could have been half as much exposition in my opinion but some people like that, I suppose. I prefer minimal exposition and lots of flavour. Both Production Design and Art Direction were impeccable and reverent to the original film, whilst not trying to recreate all the old sets just for the sake of it. I liked it but it ain't Kubrick - which is a good thing really, because Mike Flanagan directed it. And Kubrick wouldn't have directed this anyway: it's much more sprawling than The Shining: it's more episodic - which isn't a negative criticism: there's just a lot more characters involved. In fact it's a different kind of cinema to Kubrick's. It all looks a little bit TV, but I guess most cinema looks a little bit TV nowadays. And who am I to criticise anyway?

With most sequels to a very popular classic, where they go wrong is they either rehash for use most of the things right from the first film and use it in the sequel, sort of relying on it, whereas in Doctor Sleep, the plot is all about a deeper look into Danny's abilities, called the shining, and I wider look around the world where other people posses the same ability.No recalls back to The Shining feels forced, it is all used in the correct amount, only when necessary.

Making a film that was the continuation of a masterpiece by one of the greatest masters of cinema in the twentieth century, would initially be an ungrateful task, certainly the target of criticism and censorship from purists and those who have a stricter view of the seventh art. I am convinced that I am not part of that group but I was not expecting a film as pathetic and childlike as this Doctor Sleep. The foolishness and narrative simplicity typical of a youth film, span the two and a half hours of film, from beginning to end we can watch a tedious series of cliches very close to titles like ""Twilight"" or even ""Lord of the Rings"". Those who remember the subtle complexity of ""Shining"", are faced with a vampire adventure in which there is no shortage of final fights between good and bad, futuristic gadgets, caricatures from the Kubrick film, very good people and evil-laden monsters, for that everyone understands the story well. The comparison between the 1980 and 2019 film could easily lead us to sociological considerations, differences between generations, extreme simplification of the cinematic language, etc., etc. What I think is important to mention is that this thing is a shameful little story that does not honor Stanley Kubrick's memory and artistic heritage and that was certainly unnecessary.",Doctor Sleep

The mind behind is King's.

A genuine horror story without silly jump scare, it unfortunately lacks a sense of dread that the story builds up to in its third act but still manages to be satisfying. Going back to the overlook was worth the ticket price alone.
Solid performances from all the cast but a noticeable missed opportunity establishing Danny's life long torment of his childhood steals from the overall story. It is definitely worth checking out the tv adaptation of the shining that follows the book much more closely, so much so that King is in it.",Doctor Sleep

We have had so many disasters in the past that you would wonder why they keep trying.
Going into this Movie I had very low expectations so I was astonished that it was so good.
Rebecca Ferguson for me steals the movie as Rose The Hat.
I had no idea how they were going to portray her but Ferguson does an amazing job.
They didn't over do it with the effects and relied on acting to tell the story.",Doctor Sleep
506,scandinavianmail,Never got going,4,11 November 2019,"It's probably King's fault, but the bland story never seems to find its footing while slowly building up an excuse to go visit the Overlook Hotel.Ewan Mcgregor feels oddly miscast, barely moved by anything that happens and so making us not care about anything either. While most of the cast is there just to stand and talk (there's an awkward amount of standing in this movie), the lonely highlight Rebecca Ferguson is very animated, throwing everything and the kitchen sink to elevate the dull proceedings. But she only gets so far.When the action eventually returns to the Hotel, the last act barely connects to anything that happened earlier as it apparently was only there so that they could recreate the sets and scenes from the Shining. But everything is so poorly written that the Shining throwbacks come across dumb and pointless, draining the original story rather than taking it further.",Doctor Sleep
507,Metal_Robots,The title would make sense if this was sold as a sleeping,2,19 February 2020,"Just watched Doctor Sleep which is 'related' to The Shining (in the loosest possible sense). I haven't read the book, but I strongly believe that book adaptations should stand up on their own merits regardless of the source material, and i'm no Stephen King expert, but as a stand alone film Dr Sleep is terrible, completely un-scary with the nonsensical cliches and zero charisma of the hordes of modern generic bad-CGI filled bargain bin horrors that get 5/10 on IMDB and were made as filler for streaming services.It drags on for 2.5 hours with very little that actually happens aside from a couple so-bad-they're-funny scenes. It's more like a super-rubbish reboot of The Lost Boys than anything to do with The Shining, so, not quite as good as that film then....The acting is OK from Ewan McGregor but phoned-in from everyone else, the dialogue is terrible and the plot progression points were either lazy, nonsensical or predictable. Hardly any effort is made in the character's back-stories except McGregor's (which is minimal) so you really can't empathise or care about any of them. It's one of those films where all the character's behaviour is constantly stupid and un-convincing, until you realise it's because that's the easiest laziest way to to get from one scene to the next. After that point you just watch in order to laugh at how bad it can get.There are no stakes and no exciting climaxes. The two and a half hour run time feels like 5 hours. I could go into a lot more detail here but I don't think spoilers are fair even for bad films. Only watch it if you want to see how bad it is. That's the best I can say.",Doctor Sleep

Almost wanted to leave the cinema. (Hope murdering young white boys isn't going to be the norm in Hollywood? - Terminator Dark Fate had the same, released in the same week). But after all that things got much better. Once back at Overlook this movie got really good and I enjoyed it. The soundtrack helped a lot there.McGregor great. Really hated the Rebecca Ferguson character so she probably did her job well as the main villain. Supporting cast all good as was the lead young actress.Worthy sequel to The Shining but it can never be quite as good as some of the isolated atmosphere just isn't there, it gets very close though.Mike Flanagan is a good horror story teller (loved the House on Haunted Hill series) but maybe drop the disturbing stuff with kids I think and his stuff would be timeless.",Doctor Sleep

Movie starts with WB logo and classic the shining background score and now... You expect more of the shining and you get it like tracking shots, top angle with tracking shots and dissolve and overlook hotel and it's guests.
Doctor sleep has a very perfect balance of fantasy and nostalgia factor but most fascinating thing about it that it never looses its own existence.
Just like first part it is not a complete horror, it is more of a fantasy drama with scary elements.
Acting wise all did good job but Rebecca ferguson steals the show.

516,grantpaulsen,One of the Most Disappointing Films of 2019,3,15 November 2019,"This was quite frankly one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me, because I absolutely loved Mike Flanagan's previous project, The Haunting of Hill House. And honestly I think this film could've benefited from being a lot more like Hill House in the sense of it's style. What I'm trying to say is that this film should've been a 10 hour mini series, because that's the amount of time that I think was required to tell such a big story like this one. It felt like a 10 hour story crammed into a 2 and a half hour movie, so the story felt rushed, the characters (while competently acted) were very bland and forgettable. They almost start giving some of the main ones proper development, but then their arcs are completely dropped. There are story arcs in this film for the characters that go absolutely nowhere and they don't get a payoff. And then for some reason in the third act, the writers decided to do a complete 180 and decided to stop being faithful to the book, and basically devolved into a nostalgia film. Basically the entire third act was just, ""Hey remember The Shining!"" It was pretty jarring. One of the biggest killers for this movie is that it just wasn't scary. There were a couple of moments that were well executed and they felt like they came from the same guy who made The Haunting of Hill House, but other than a few moments I just did not find the film scary. And since the story arcs and themes didn't go anywhere, I found the film to be incredibly boring despite how rushed the story felt. Very rarely do I find pacing within a film to be an issue, so you have to do quite a lot in order for me to give a film that kind of criticism. I still love Mike Flanagan and I can't wait to see what he does next, but for me this film was one of the biggest disappointments of the year.",Doctor Sleep
517,alesisqs61,Close to perfect,8,31 October 2019,"This was better than I expected but nothing will live up to Kubrick's vision. As much as I love pretty much all of Mike Flanagan's movies he seems like he held back on certain aspects of his unique style like in Hill House for example. The first 80% or so of the film actually stands alone as a great flick and it does deviate to my dismay from King's ending which would have served better simply because the issues that didn't work for me was recasting Jack and Wendy Torrence for no name actors. No one can live up to that, PERIOD!
My theory, which may or may not be true, is that King agreed to do this movie based on the fact on how it ends and not because he wanted a sequel to the movie version of The Shining. We all know he hated Kubrick's version so then why did he green light this movie? Well... it's simply because I think he wanted to shove that ending into Kubrick's film without actually travelling back in time. He succeeded to take a dump on Kubrick's ending even though Doctor Sleep doesn't even end like that. So... Mike and King talked about why this film should be an adaptation of not only the new book, but also a true sequel to Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece right? Right? Wrong.... I see the Overlook as a gimmick in this film that served no true purpose. It's one thing to do a full adaptation like Kubrick but it's a whole different ball game when you take that same masterpiece which was not King's vision anyways and turn it upside down to get movie goers excited to see the film based on that alone. The reason I gave it 8/10 is simply because the ending did not feel like a nod to the Shining at all, but it felt disingenuous whether it was or not. I don't think Mike felt that way but I can only imagine King was super excited to see his Shining ending finally see the light of day on the big screen and not the absolute crap-fest that was the TV mini-series. Of course that's just the way I look at it whether or not it's true and if it was true I highly doubt King would ever admit to it. The new girl and Rose the hat characters were excellent as was everything that built up to the mini climax of the film. It's certainly worth seeing in a good theater. The use of surround channels was great so if you don't hear them, you're theater sucks.
Acting - 10
Style - 9
Sound - 8 - It got repetitive after awhile which is a shame because they had the right idea by using cues from The Shining but then it seemed like they used the heart beat score WAY too much and that's a fact, not opinion. Kubrick's version had an untouchable score.",Doctor Sleep

521,brent-27849,Genius versus hack,1,29 March 2021,"Doctor Sleep is not built off King's novel, the Shining, it's built off of Kubrick's brilliant movie vision. Thus, it is perfectly fair to compare the two and say why one is the work of a genius while the other is the work of a complete hack. It also begs the question why exactly King thought Doctor Sleep was good, since it cribs and pretty much rips off entire scenes from Kubrick's movie. Maybe it's supposed to be poke in the eye to the director, that see, anyone can do what he did. Well, no, not anyone can, as Doctor Sleep more than illustrates.Doctor Sleep can rip off the original score, the heartbeat, but it doesn't make any difference, doesn't make it interesting or scary, merely pathetic; where Kubrick used it to create mood and tension that fit the scenes and the characters, Flanagan uses it as a cheap stunt because he doesn't have anything else to do. Case in point, he uses the heartbeat while Danny is working a menial job and uses the music for Abra getting on and off a fricking bus. Hackdom at its best.Then there is the pathetic attempt to re-create scenes from the Shining. Well, hello there, go ahead, re-create all the scenes, like Danny riding his little wheeler through the hotel and stopping at room 237, all it proves is that just because you can shoot the same scene doesn't mean you have a clue. I'm reminded of Gus Van Sant doing a shot by shot re-make of Hitchcock's Psycho. Another amazingly bad idea, but at least there was some reason behind trying what ended up being an exercise in futility; it wasn't simply because he was trying to rip someone off with far greater talent. (At least I hope not).Then there is the pathetic attempt to re-create some of the characters from the original. All I can say is the acting ranged from laughable to downright offensive. Just because you get some people who kind of look or sound like the originals doesn't make them any less fake. Wendy, nope, young Danny, nope, Halloran, nope. Not even close. The worst is some guy who was supposed to be playing Jack. First of all, was he actually supposed to look like Jack Nicholson, even from the side? Because I got news for you, he sure didn't. I can't even go into how bad it is from there. It's just bad. Really bad.Not only that but again to use them to try and re-create iconic scenes from the Shining, like Wendy swinging the bat, Jack chasing Danny with the axe, like why don't you try coming up with your own ideas instead of ripping off Kubrick? Even the bathroom scene. I got news for you, by the time Jack had finished using the axe, both panels of the bathroom door had been chopped in. If you're going to rip it off, at least do it right. Same as Jack suddenly being the bartender, Lloyd, like what the hell is that about? If Jack was anything, he was Grady, the caretaker of the Overlook. And no, he's not every other character in the Shining, from the twins girls on down, they all existed in real life at one point. And by the way, Jack drinks bourbon with a little ice, not Daniels neat - a small thing perhaps, but again, if you're going to do a rip off, at least do it right.Speaking of the Overlook. Let's get something straight, that is where all the ghosts reside. They don't reside anywhere else in the world, the lady taking a bath does so in room 237, not in an apartment in Florida for crying out loud. They don't follow people and they don't reside in Danny's mind in little boxes. Understand something, Danny is important, of course, but he is not the first and he is not the only one. This has been going on since before 1910 when the Overlook was built. The entire concept of the Shining is that the ghosts reside at the Overlook forever, just as Jack has always been the caretaker of the Overlook, forever. Because the people who stayed there left a trace, and because a lot of things have happened at the hotel over the years, some of them not very good. Just as Jack also had interaction with the ghosts, the lady in the tub, the real bartender of the Overlook, Lloyd. Just as Wendy has interactions with the ghosts, or at least sees them all, she's the one who sees all the corpses in the Gold room, she's the one who the guy with the split forehead says to, 'Great party, isn't it?' Neither of them have the Shine, maybe Danny sees them first because of that, but the ghosts, such as they are, are real. As evidenced by the lady in the tub trying to strangle Danny. But more than physical reality, they have psychological reality. Their power is to drive people insane. But here's an important point, not by entering them, as in Doctor Sleep; not by having the wicked little twin girls, along with the rest, suddenly turn and go after Danny. It's not a frickin' possession story, as evidenced by Danny supposedly taken over and ready to kill Abra. If Flanagan understood that, then he would be Kubrick, instead of what he is. A hack.Now to be fair, I suppose I should look at the parts of the film that aren't complete and obvious rip-offs. Ok, that part of the movie is pretty much a waste of time. Again I'll start with Danny, played by Ewan McGregor, who to be honest, I never for a second felt was actually Danny all grown up. Maybe it's unfair because I guess we all have our own ideas of how Danny would turn out as an adult. I actually thought he would turn out mostly okay, maybe with a family of his own, so the fact that he's portrayed as a drunk loner was a little unexpected, though rather obvious. Still, not including the Shining rip-offs, I have to say if his name was Bob and the entire rest of the movie had absolutely no connection to the original, I don't think I would have noticed the difference. It would still be bad mind you, just not so odious.Maybe because it's not particularly scary for one thing. I mean Abra, who was average at best, never seemed like she was in real danger for a second. As soon as Hat Lady ever came around, she blew her right out of the water anyway. And as for Hat Lady, all I can say is that must have been one of the real drawing factors for Rebecca Ferguson - hey, you get to wear a cool hat for the entire movie. Cool.I guess the best way to describe the bad guys is that they were a bunch of vampires, only instead of drinking blood, they drink steam. What? Again what is this doing in a sequel to the Shining? But not just that, they had to be the most pathetic vampires ever. I mean, here I am thinking they have all of these super powers, ability to eat well and live long, well, yeah, as long as they make sure to wear their seatbelts and never get into an accident. And don't get your hand caught in card a catalogue, that must really smart. Oh, and don't get shot either, in some stupid gunfight. Again, what a hodgepodge of hackdom. What else? Well, I guess you better watch both ways before crossing the street too and don't stick your finger in a light socket and don't drink milk past its expiration date. I mean, if this was all that was required to kill them, how the heck did any of them survive this long anyway?Now I said the movie wasn't scary, but that doesn't mean it wasn't absolutely disgusting. Starting out with a little girl getting swarmed by a bunch of adults. Then watching a little boy get tied down, tortured and murdered. Again, hack Flanagan might wish to learn the difference between scary and disgusting and that not only do the two not go together, they are actually the opposite of each other. Perhaps worst is the blond chick, who starts out showing the wrongness of child luring. Okay, fair enough. Except then suddenly she's part of the group kidnapping, torturing and murdering little children. I don't know what message that's supposed to convey but from where I am, that's about as disgusting as you can get. Victimizing bad, unless you're the one making someone else the victim? That's just gross.But is it fair to review Doctor Sleep as two different movies, one a rip of the Shining and the other not? Oh, I absolutely agree. The most pathetic part is when the two are put together, when Hat Lady shows up at the Overlook. First they rip off another iconic scene of the Shining in the maze. Then they rip it off again on the staircase, only this time it's Danny backing up with an axe and Hat Lady getting ready to perform some kung fu on him - again, is there anything Flanagan won't rip off? But then, to make it worst of all, Hat Lady is destroyed because Danny supposedly lets all the ghosts of the Overlook out of their little boxes in his mind and they devour her because they're starving. One more time, Flanagan doesn't have a clue about the Shining and had no business making this movie. The ghosts are not vampires, pal. They don't devour people physically, they devour people's hearts and minds and souls. They're not starving, they simply wait for the next innocent to come. You see, crappy vampires, Flanagan, are something you created, not Kubrick, get it straight. And for you to shoehorn the brilliance of the Shining movie into your Doctor Sleep junk is beyond pathetic. I mean, bad enough when you're trying to.to shoehorn it the other way to try and give your lousy movie more value than it deserves, but to reduce Kubrick's masterpiece to something that is there simply to serve your movie is not just bad, it's offensive.Still, I do have to give credit where credit is due. There is one thing Doctor Sleep made me think about and reconsider. It's the bath lady in room 237. I used to think how awful and evil she must be. Thanks to this movie, I realized something, it's everyone else who keeps walking in on her. First Danny and Jack in the original Shining, then Danny and Abra in Doctor Sleep. I mean, she was just minding her own business, trying to take a bath in her own privacy, and everyone keeps coming in and bothering her. Guess I would be a little annoyed too after a while. How rude.",Doctor Sleep

There's only a few that are worth mentioning! THE SHINING is definitely the No. 1 next to Carrie! I was sooo excited for this movie, and although I knew it would never be as good as the shining I was hoping to at least be close to it. But what did I just watch? It took me two days to finish this movie, I fell asleep and had to continue the next day. I didn't even feel like continuing cuz I was so bored and disappointed. The only reason why I kept watching was to know the end and when the last 30 min were on I had to rewind bc I feel asleep again! This movie is so chaotic by the way it's made...there's no connection.. it just jumps in scenes ... way too long... absolutely not scary and all in all just plain stupid from beginning to end! The initial idea of a grown up Danny Torrance struggling is great but why the weird supernatural stuff was a part I have no idea. Yes he has a gift I get it but it was not portrayed well. It seemed ridiculous not like in the original one where it was just so very scary and disturbing! This could have been so cool if it was kept more simple. I'm not blaming the director much. If that was the story ( I have never read the book) then there's not much you can change as a director. Filming was decent. Acting was ok! I'm a Ewan McGregor fan and he def was the best part of the movie but the story was so boring and pointless - I don't understand why it was written like that! Why not just have a grown up Danny struggling with addiction going back to the town or hotel and experiencing things there. Why all these weird Gypsy ppl and the other little girl and this and that and too much for my taste!

527,MCMCMLXX,Most probably like the book - and that's a problem ...,6,4 November 2019,"Some books are good, some books are bad. I've read only some Stephen King novels, and overall I am underwhelmed by them. He's very descriptive which drags his novels along only to have pockets of horror. I also think most of his novels turned into films are flimsy (Christine, Cujo, It). For me, This was evident of Doctor Sleep.Now I haven't read the book because I've surpassed his novels. But you can tell King's taste in stories and movies. Doctor Sleep was not a good film because of the story.I give it credit for the willingness the director related the obvious original material for the film (not the novel) to Kubrick's The Shining; a movie we are told King disliked. And for good reason- it wasn't his story.And that's why I loved The Shining. Kubrick was visionary, and his movie was full of dread.And you really miss the dread in Doctor Sleep, because King cannot write dread. And he doesn't have to. He's a very successful writer. I don't find his writing compelling but I would say he has brilliant ideas, but for movies of his work, he's better off leaving it to the experts in their field to ""base"" the movie on his books. Mostly they do a far better job in telling a story of his.Doctor Sleep has its good points particularly Kyliegh Curran who plays a great role as Shining's child protégé to this story, and she has brilliant ways of portraying an innocent merging into a horror of her own reckoning. She's gonna be the one to watch in future out of this.Rose the Hat character (as with all of the other types of monsters in this film) is not needed to be added to the original story. It's too busy enough of a story without these others coming into it. I didn't get them at all. It was more than one story. Perhaps King was on cocaine when he wrote this story as well (he admits to his drug abuse that he does write about in his horror). It certainly has an element of wtf.I'm not comparing it to Kubrick - how could you? It is just a flawed story that the director had to take us on because he had to appease the over inflated author's rights of King.Can I say without spoiler: the main ""horror"" in The Shining movie truly horrifies you when you first see it. You cannot take your eyes off it even when it comes at Jack slowly. But in Doctor Sleep, that same character is overdone so much, that it has taken out all of the horror it truly has on your senses.Again - no dread.Shame.

You have sympathy for him with his performance as the tormented Danny. Rebecca Ferguson is top notch as Rose the Hat as she senses Danny's Psychic correspondence is interrupted by a Gifted young girl. Abre Stone, (Kyleigh Curran) who the True Knot is after. Now, since Kubrick's THE SHINING is such an iconic classic Film. And as many times I've watched this film any fan should know the story by now. Flanagan stays true to the story and he combines elements with Kubrick's which I respect and I was satisfied with. The Film stands on it's own. Really it does. As for the critics, You judge the Film yourself. They were so quick to negatively bash IT CHAPTER TWO which I enjoyed as well that they must know that film was actually well and sufficient.
Honestly, I've never read a Stephen King novel and I have no desire to do so. Yes again, it is a worthy satisfying Sequel to Kubrick's Classic that Flows through out. My rating: 8.0",Doctor Sleep
531,iamMarkPrice,Pop horror junk with a twist of made for TV,3,30 January 2020,"It's no secret that Stephen King hated what Stanley Kubrick did to his story in The Shining (1980), something King was clearly resolute in not allowing to happen with it's apparent sequel Doctor Sleep. This is a film about the life of Danny Torrance (Roger Dale Floyd/Ewan McGregor) in the years after The Shining. Released almost 40 years after the original Stanley Kubrick film, Doctor Sleep tries to make up for this gap by setting itself across 3 time periods, 1980, 2011 & 2019.A lot has changed in those 40 years, including key plot points like how Shining works. Dick Hallorann (Carl Lumbly) now pops in and out of scenes from beyond the grave as if he's Obi Wan from Star Wars, redirecting Danny with ambiguous advice seemingly for no other reason than to drive the plot before spoofing out of existence again.Alex Essoe (playing Wendy Torrance), throws everything she has at an attempt to match Shelley Duvall; unfortunately she's not up to task and fails miserably. This still is a highlight of the films acting, as the rest of the cast is down hill from there failing to engage with the story or drive audience participation. Kyliegh Curran does the best she can with the script, but has little to play off from Ewan McGregor's Danny or Rebecca Ferguson's Rose the Hat.Unlike Kubrick's The Shining, with Doctor Sleep what you see is what you get and no more depth than that. There's no suspense here, no slow creep or heightening stakes. No emotional devastation, no off tilt feeling and definitely no abstract meanings to be debated for decades to come. With no clear vision, Doctor Sleep draws clear colour pallet influence from the likes of James Wan's Insidious and art direction from Twilight, with the $45M 3 hour long film feeling like a cheap made for TV tween thriller. At times it feels like writer/director Mike Flanagan's poorly written love letter to Kubrick that entirely missed the point, only to be interrupted by King's hackery.The reality is that while the marketing team would have you believe this is a sequel to Kubrick's 1980 film, in reality it lines up far better both in plot and style to Stephen King's 1997 TV mini-series version of The Shining. But given how much of a departure from King's book by the same name Kubrick took, that really shouldn't be a surprise. The truth is, audiences were hoodwinked at the box office by this one thinking they were getting , and it only goes to further show how much of the timeless brilliance of Kubrick's version came from his alterations, and how big a hack Stephen King truly is.Nothing saves this film, not the easter eggs, not the trivial attempt to recreate scenes from the overlook (that get the layout of the hotel wrong) and not it's Marvel style camera effects. It's simply an empty, lifeless husk and that's great news because it means there's still room for someone else to come along and make a true Kubrick style sequel. Now that's something worth getting excited about.",Doctor Sleep

534,mrnomore,"It's not a great movie, but it's a good ride",6,30 January 2020,"I'll just write the pros and cons because it feels like that's why i gave it 6/10Cons:
Too many elements and stories in one single movie. It was like looking at a photo with several different focal points.Unfinished stories. Several character related stories just disappeared into nothingness. It felt like you begin to eat and good meal and suddenly a waiter takes your plate away and gives you new one.Finished stories. There were couple of stories that build up this movie, but finished earlier then expected. A house with four legs suddenly has only three.Pros:
It's well made. Feels like most of the production was well planed and executed.Well played. Actors did a good job. Kyliegh Curran was pretty perfect for the role.Connections. The story's ""roots"" are well entangled. Both the shiny parts and the predator parts.Conclusion:
I really like this movie, but the script(storytelling made it hard. They could have skipped some of those minor (yet very prominent) stories and made it about a half hour shorter. Still, well done and worth a watch.",Doctor Sleep
535,Hopedoesnotdie,Truly awful,2,16 November 2019,"Took a great cinematic film and made a sequel that is like a generic rip off of a Black Mirror episode. I almost walked out after the satanic cult stabbed the little boy and tortured him, truly bad taste and on top of that the whole movie was like a PC -neo feminist- trying to be Hollywood woke JOKE of a movie. I'm not suprised this movie bombed, Hollywood suits right now truly have their heads up their you know what! Inept, shallow, bad writing and ruining great art. The actress in the goofy hat was awful and the costume designer should be fired. The actors they cast to stand in for the young Danny and his mom took me out of it, they should have invested in using CGI to bring back Shelley and the original child Danny. The direction and the weird terminator like possessed eyes were cheesy. Overall cliche and predictable and probably one of the worst movies I've seen this year. The only thing that got me through it is that I had a hot date holding my hand and leaning on me. I'm truly convinced critics only gave it a high rating because of the DIVERSITY!

536,faisalisat,Better than The Shining!?!,7,9 November 2019,"Controversial title?! I watched The Shining a week before Doctor Sleep. A movie ahead of its time with weird but great storytelling let down by its ending (I'm with Stephen King on this). I gave it 7/10 on IMDb, 7.5/10 is more accurate.Fast forward to this. It benefits from not being stuck in The Overlook hotel which gets purposely claustrophobic. The premise is we pick up on Danny Torrance's journey after the events of The Shining.When I saw that this was nearly 2 hours 30 minutes long, I felt like it might be a struggle to watch, I was wrong. The cat and mouse main story of the child and Rebecca Ferguson's villainous character keeps you on the edge of the seat.Credit to the actors because Rebecca Ferguson was brilliant, the new kid too! Jacob Tremblay's performance I can't really describe without spoiling but once again proving what a great talent he is. Ewan McGregor does a good job too.If you're a fan of The Shining then I don't think you'll be disappointed. I do recommend that you do what I did if you've not seen The Shining and watch that first, it'll make Doctor Sleep make more sense.",Doctor Sleep

539,screenotes,Doctoring Kubrick in service of King,6,7 August 2020,"Director and Screenwriter Mike Flanagan's film Doctor Sleep, an adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling 2013 novel of the same name sees a middle-aged Danny (son of Jack) Torrance seeking to start a new life in a new town yet being drawn into battling a troupe of steam-addicted, child-killing near immortals by a young girl rich with magic (which is possibly the same thing as The Shining power that Danny possesses and both may be the same thing as the aforementioned 'Steam'). Yes, it's The Shining Part II and apart from Danny (now Dan) we're introduced to a whole new cast of characters.Adapting a novel to screen is challenging at the best times, yet when the source material is a sequel to a much-loved original novel, which in turn was adapted into an undeniable classic of cinema, the challenge rises. But here's the real rub, many fans of the original The Shining actively loathe Kubrick's adaptation for being too far removed from its source material, including Mr King himself.I can empathise with Mike Flanagan. As a Critic striving for perfection at all times, satisfying disparate groups of avid and let's face it, 'rabid' fans across the world can be a challenge. Particularly when the art of Criticism is one which is so dependent on its source material - the films which one is charged with reviewing - as Critics don't have the luxury afforded to novelists of plucking any old idea from the ether and putting it to the page.The dearth of successful book to screen adaptations, let alone adaptations of King's own work is evidence enough of the proportional relationship between degrees of removal from the source material and the increase in difficulty. That is, the job of the Screenwriter who must deconstruct a novel before reconstructing its remaining parts for the visual medium is more difficult than that of the novelist and the job of the Director who must deconstruct the screenplay and then effectively communicate a vision to a cast and crew is harder still. Readers should then therefore draw their own conclusion as to whether the job of the Critic - or to spell it out, the job of deconstructing a visual work which has itself been deconstructed from an original written work, in order to effectively communicate the key question of how viewers should spend their valuable time- is vastly underappreciated.I'm not saying Stephen King couldn't do what I do (that's for the reader to decide), I'm merely pointing out the enormity of the task befalling Mike Flanagan as Director and Screenwriter of a work which is an adapted sequel to not one but two, disparate, iconic works.So how well did Mr Flanagan do? Perhaps damningly, Mr King himself is on record as being a fan of the adaptation. Though let's not hold Mr King's hereto-proven lack of judgement against Mr Flanagan, for even a stopped clock gives the right time twice a day. In defence of both parties, The Author has also been effusive in his praise of Flanagan's previous adaptation of His work, Gerald's Game, and I agree with King that Flanagan did as good a job as anyone could have hoped to, considering the source novel is widely regarded as one of King's worst and had previously been considered 'unfilmable'.Despite what Mr King would say, when it comes to film adaptations of his work, less has always proven to be more. Films such as IT: Chapter Two and The Dark Tower failed to resonate with filmgoers due largely to the fact that they tried to pack in so much story as to leave little room for the creation of suspense. This was not true of Kubrick's The Shining, which eschewed exposition for iconic moments and created suspense through lack of action.Doctor Sleep is a more enjoyable ride than either the aforementioned flops. The acting is strong with the ever-watchable Ewan McGregor believable as an adult Danny and Rebecca Ferguson brings a charm and charisma to the murderous big bad, Rose the Hat. The plot has some interesting turns but there is just too much going on, leading to a total lack of suspense.In the end, in trying to please everyone, the film ends up falling short on too many fronts. While two thirds of the film seem to slavishly hew to King's source material, struggling to balance exposition and plot propulsion, the final third feels like fan service for Kubrick's film. This has the effect of feeling like two different movies mashed together. Speaking as a fan of Kubrick's film, the final third is especially underwhelming as watching a re-creation of iconic scenes by different actors served less as the intended nostalgia trip than a reminder that I was not watching the work of Kubrick.As sure as Stephen King will not accept that the Review is the highest form of Art - nor reply to my numerous emails on the matter - Mike Flanagan will lose no fans for Doctor Sleep. Yet for fans of Kubrick's The Shining, his legacy is more prevalent in Flanagan's Oculus (2013).",Doctor Sleep

The Shining is one of my all-time favorite movies and Doctor Sleep is a worthy sequel. It may not have Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Stanley Kubrick or any of the original crew, but the new characters and actors bring their own life into the film.

If you haven't seen Stanley Kubrick's film version of Stephen King's book ""The Shining"" - a masterpiece despite King apparently not liking it - you're going to be behind the eight ball here, particularly during the fabulous last half hour where we return to The Overlook Hotel for a sumptuous homage to Kubrick's film. I'll say no more!
At close to three hours, it's quite a journey to get to the good stuff but the payoff is there in spades.
There were times I wondered 'where is this going?', having not read the book but I'm glad I hung in there.

547,janjeltes,A perspective from a person who avoids most horror films,7,23 November 2019,"I have mixed feelings about this film. There are powerful scenes in the first 2/3 of the film, especially a very confronting scene which is performed superbly.
Most of the acting is solid. Rose the Hat, Danny & Abra are interesting characters. However, the execution of Abra's performance was inconsistent and she frequently left me wanting to see more of Rose or Danny. Abra was also a ""Mary Sue"" which will irritate me as the best of times and challenge any decent actor.
At one point, there is a change in the focus to select cast. This is the point where the story stumbled and never recovered. The focus characters couldn't hold the story together. Abbey's character was too simplistic, Rose was far less interesting without her colleagues in the scene and Danny was a character who responded rather than did anything and I lacked true investment in Danny.
The film does an excellent job of avoiding cliched scares. The lighting and camerawork was excellent. There were many Easter eggs throughout the film.
However, the end of the film was jarring in too many ways. The characters didn't work for a good ending. Also, the shoe-horning of threads across both films was unsatisfying.
If it wasn't for solid acting from Fergusson and McGregor, this film would have received a 5 or lower from me. Abra was very difficult to pull off and her delivery just didn't consistently deliver.
I can accept dialled in performances in a comic book adaptation but not a psychological thriller.",Doctor Sleep

552,edenney01,"Not The Shining by any means, but a decent movie in its own right.",7,28 June 2020,"I was very reluctant to watch this from the moment I heard they were making the movie, and I wouldn't have paid to see it in theaters, but I watched it on cable last night and it wasn't entirely bad. It's only loosely connected to The Shining, and honestly could've been a stand alone movie with no connection whatsoever with a modest re-writing of the script. In fact it kind of felt like a completely separate movie that just cashed in on the name of the original, and wove a little bit of that plot into this one.Rebecca Ferguson did a great job in the lead role as Rose the Hat, Ewan McGregor was okay in the role of the adult Danny, and the girl who played Abra was fine. The other roles were all pretty forgettable imo. What I didn't like about the movie was the recasting of so many of the principle roles from The Shining with actors you just couldn't accept as replacements for such a legendary movie. There's only one Jack Nicholson, and nobody is like Shelly Duvall (though this actress did her best) or Scatman Cruthers. Also didn't like the boy they cast as the young Danny. Even the smaller roles from The Shining, such as the twin girls, Grady, the crazy decomposing woman in the bathtub, are all so ingrained in our heads after seeing The Shining so many times over the years, it's just impossible to replace them and make it feel right. Apparently they didn't have the budget needed to replace those actors faces digitally. If they had at least done it with Jack and he'd lent his voice for the movie in the brief scene that he had, it would've helped a lot.Because of all of those things, and the lack of dread and suspense that the original movie brought so well, I can't give Doctor Sleep more than 7 stars. It is worth watching though imo, if you can try not to focus too much on comparing it to The Shining.",Doctor Sleep

Blade Runner did a slightly better job of bridging a similar gap.All this aside, I didn't find my attention levels dropping off when watching the film. Some good performances and it was interesting to see the Outlook Hotel being used at the end. Not sure it quite worked, but nice idea.I thought Rebecca Ferguson played her part well.

One part in particular where they kidnap a young boy was very difficult to watch.The movie falls a little flat in the third act when they arrive at the Overlook. It started to feel like one of those made-for-Youtube fan made sequels. I get that they had to reference the movie since more people are familiar with it than the novel, but they could've just done it with brief flashbacks.

565,josephbrewster-88279,"True to source material, but...",8,20 November 2019,"I'm a fan of King's writing, having read most of his novels over the years. His movies, however, not so much. When I read Doctor Sleep, I thought ""this one won't make it to the big screen"", so I was surprised when the trailers landed. It didn't seem like a story anyone was begging for on film and certainly didn't strike me as a bankable piece of IP for a studio.More often than not, King's vision is better suited for book than big screen, and the adaptations have largely failed to impress me, with some notable exceptions. However, with decent casting and a healthy budget (especially for a horror movie), I was willing to give it a try.The movie was a solid drama/horror with strong acting, plenty of character development, some no-holds-barred ugly horror moments like only King provides, and enough nods to the original to please any Shining fan. With a two and a half hour plus runtime, the director took his time to get it right, and the result is an adaptation shockingly in line with the source (far more than the recent Pet Semetary).But...
The theater was nearly empty, which didn't surprise me. Almost none of my friends have ever read the book or are devoted enough either to Kubrick's previous attempt or The Shining book to care about a sequel, and it seems that is a common sentiment. It doesn't surprise me that this movie will land largely under the radar due to its IP and niche target audience. What surprises me is that the studio thought otherwise and seemed confident enough to plan a sequel.In conclusion, this is an excellent movie which more than does Justice to the source. If you've read the book you will enjoy it; if you haven't, you may find yourself a bit lost and struggling to recall the original Shining for context. Much like Blade Runner 2049, this is a brilliant piece of film that is most likely too long and too obscure to be palatable to the average moviegoer, but I for one will accept this financial misstep by the studio as the beautiful piece of adapted material it is. No complaints!",Doctor Sleep
566,jacobywarner,Surprised by an Incredibly Well Done Movie,8,26 November 2019,"So before I start I must say, I was very scared to watch this film and I recall being extremely upset when I found out that they were creating a sequel to arguably the most iconic work of Stanley Kubrick. But when I sat down in the theater and they rolled the movie I found myself hooked, clutching the arm rests of my seat.Going in to this movie I was not aware that it was 2hrs and 32mins but even after the credits rolled I found myself wanting more, the world that Mike Flanagan created was amazing. His use of camera movement created an amazing weightless feeling throwing the audience face first into a magical world ruled by several succubus spirits who prey on people with incredible powers. His framing was second to only Kubrick allowing for several stagnant shots to be reminiscent of paintings with incredible blocking furthering the depth of his storytelling.Now despite all the good, I still found it hard to watch the recreated scenes without the likes of Jack Nicholson and It is because of this that I am only giving it an 8/10. I understand that he was probably too expensive plus his current age would have created more issues I filming but I would have rather had the filmmaker just cut the flashbacks using different methods of storytelling to further the movie. I am happy that they didn't try and Ang Lee a new face on top of a stand in for Jack Nicholson but the reshoots just pulled me out of the film and it saddens me that this is the only thing that has brought down my rating.",Doctor Sleep

If this movie didn't use Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece to create some buzz, the ratings would be very different.",Doctor Sleep
568,flopezgraziano,Boring,4,22 July 2020,"The film takes place years after the events of ""The Shining"", and stars an adult Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), who lives a messy and chaotic life, always drinking and escaping from a trauma he has not been able to overcome. However, one day he is ""rescued"" by the gentle Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis), who helps him by taking him to therapy, and giving him a job. So things seem to be going well for Danny... until, thanks to his ""power"" (the ""glow""), he begins to make a connection with a girl named Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran).It turns out that, despite having abilities very similar to Danny's, Abra is particularly powerful, so she is being pursued by a cult led by Rose The Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). The cult members want to live forever - or at least longer than the average human being - which is why they kidnap children to steal their ""glow"" - or soul, or power, or as they call it in the movie, ""steam"". So Danny will have to try to protect Abra from these dark forces, as he tries to deal with his own inner demons, and a power he has not wanted to use since the famous incident at the Overlook Hotel.A film over two hours long, like ""Sleep Doctor"", has to find some way to justify such an extension - it has to have a plot complicated enough to require such a long film, or at least characters that deserve more time than usual to be presented or developed. Unfortunately, that's not the case with ""Dream Doctor"". The pace at which the film moves is slow, lethargic, but unlike The Shining, in Sleepy Doctor it feels free and unnecessary. In fact, in structural terms, the film does not work at all - one could take away about twenty minutes from the first act - unnecessarily dependent on flashbacks and full of irrelevant information - and the final product would be much better. Flanagan should have had a more ruthless editor to build the film; the problem is that he did the work himself.
However, even if the film was a little shorter and more agile, the final result would not be entirely satisfactory. As mentioned above, ""Dream Doctor"" suffers from an identity problem; it contradicts in some ways what was revealed in Kubrick's film, and it has a tone more similar to that of King's novels, introducing dozens of new characters, and abusing explanatory dialogues. However, he also refers to the film ""The Shining"", even recreating some of its most famous scenes, replicating some of its most famous shots, and reconstructing some of its most iconic locations. I understand Flanagan's intention, but this ends up making ""Doctor Dream"" feel like an erratic, even contradictory, film.In fact, the recreations of the scenes in ""The Shining"" are inserted at the least necessary moments, taking the viewer out of the fiction, making him realize that he is seeing something very different from Kubrick's work - which wouldn't be such a bad thing, if Flanagan didn't constantly refer to it during the third act of his film. The fact that he doesn't include the classic scenes themselves, but rather has hired new actors to do them again, certainly doesn't help - they don't look anything like the protagonists of ""The Shining,"" and instead make his scenes feel like promotional cosplay videos. ""Dream Doctor"" is not a cheap film and, in general, it doesn't feel like one... except during these moments.It is worth noting, however, that ""Doctor Dream"" is elegantly directed, and very well photographed. The film makes the most of its locations, and even uses novel resources during its darkest scenes - especially when we see Abra make a remote connection with Rose The Hat. The fades between scenes give the film a very classic quality - to develop a connection",Doctor Sleep

579,ecvoid,Outstanding! So the downvotes were the doing of...,10,22 January 2020,"...older fans maybe? ""Back in my day horror was artistic, abstract nothingness culminating in an underwhelming ending"". That was The Shining... The best thing since sliced bread...
Doctor Sleep however employs more clear supernatural aspects. The antagonists are also clearly discernible. Probably that's why the low rating: old fans of The Shining were expecting more of the same slow burning, undefined psychological bad trip. Doctor Sleep is not lacking in refinement though. The depictions of astral projection and mindscapes were truly awe inspiring.
And here lies the problem: The Shining and Doctor Sleep have a few points of intersection; before and after those, they continue to be pretty much independent films placed at a considerable distance to each other on the horror spectrum. The first is a psychological thriller with almost indiscernible supernatural elements. The latter is a full blown supernatural horror.
The one thing I can't express an opinion is how faithful any Stephen King films/shows are to his novels. When Mr. King became a sensation, I'm sad to say, his works weren't widely available in my country. But based only on the cinematographic aspects, Doctor Sleep is a perfect balance of entertainment and artistic value.",Doctor Sleep

And all of the actors gave top notch performances. Needless to say I was very impressed with the movie as a whole. The ending wasn't my favorite but it wasn't bad in the scheme of things.

601,yv_es,"Ok film, poor sequel to Kubrick's Shining",6,28 June 2020,"Dr. Sleep isn't a bad film. I'd happily watch it on an airplane. Well actually, maybe not on an airplane given that this film does contain some surprisingly gruesome scenes, but you get the idea.However, is Dr. Sleep a good sequel to The Shining? Well, although the film certainly pays homage to the original, I must admit that, in this regard, Dr. Sleep does not fare nearly as well. That's a problem given that a key reason anyone is going to watch Dr. Sleep is that it is a sequel to The Shining.Let me pause here to once more remind myself that Dr. Sleep is actually an adaptation of a Stephen King novel of the same name. That novel is a sequel to King's original Shining story. In this light, some of the creative decisions taken with in the Dr. Sleep film start to make a lot more sense. Why are there pseudo-vampires and a weird cult family for example? Stephen King, that's why.But let's not kid ourselves. Dr. Sleep was advertised as a sequel to Kubrick's The Shining. The filmmakers certainly thought they were making a sequel at least, since they make callbacks to the film all the time.Thankfully Dr. Sleep isn't some Bambi II or Phantom Menace. Instead, it's more of a ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"". 2010 is decent enough, but it's saddled with being the sequel to one of the greatest films of all time.If nothing else, I'm thankful that Dr. Sleep didn't go full Jack Torrance on Kubrick's masterpiece. It's respectful, even though it feels more like your standard Halloween blockbuster. I miss the atmosphere from the original, the creeping psychological horror, the slow burn.So no, Dr. Sleep isn't a bad film at all. But it's also not a worthy sequel to The Shining. Kubrick's take on The Shining famously strayed from Stephen King's source material. Perhaps Dr. Sleep needed to do more of this as well",Doctor Sleep

A must see for fans of King's The Shining, but also fans of Kubrick's The Shining. Since King was not a fan of Kubrick's version, it's interesting to see how faithful Flanagan remains to the novel. There are a few standout scenes that are meant to feel iconic and reminiscent. Some of these work well, but after awhile it feels like they are there for the sake of Kubrick's version. This film has that definite melancholy feel. The Newton Brothers soundtrack is the real standout here. They reprised the original score's feel, but make it modern at the same time. Their use of various instruments and sounds are both effective and recognizable, making it truly significant to the story. The film runs a little long at 152 minutes, some of which feels lagged compared to The Shining's 144 minutes.",Doctor Sleep

I think for my generation, The Shining is one of those movies that is etched into your memory. Much like Blade Runner, a sequel to such a revered and influential classic, is surely frought with danger.Despite the trepidation, I had confidence that the creators behind Doctor Sleep would surely recognise this and rise to the challenge. And rise they did. Though my anticipation of this movie was as much to do with nostalgia as it was for the sheer entertainment, I'm pleased that much of the movie is a stand-alone story; introducing sinister and disturbing characters and a plot that makes you forget about your anticipation of the Overlook.The pacing is spot on, a couple of truly harrowing and impactful scenes and stunning visuals throughout.My only gripe.. a small one in the grand scheme of the story, but a significant one if you're anticipating it, is when the ghosts of the Overlook eventually do make their appearance. The twins were rather cheesy and unconvincing. Delivering the same creepy lines, but not exactly the same cadence. The sound and look of them from the original are just so particular, that this movie would've done better to keep them distant; not so prominent on screen, if they couldn't absolutely nail it. And I don't think they did nail that aspect. A couple of the other original ghosts were a little unconvincing also.But all that said, it was an excellent and compelling story, with much original content and an appropriate dash of Kubrick to complete the experience.",Doctor Sleep

616,RobertWhitebrow,A homeopathic version of The Shining,3,6 December 2020,"I do not believe I have been this disappointed in a long time by a movie. If this was a stand-alone movie I'd actually consider it pretty decent, but as a sequel you are not allowed to spit on everything that made the original great and expect people to be happy about it. And yes, I know it's based on King's sequel book. What I do not know is whether the book itself was a flop or just the movie adaptation messed up.So, if you are expecting the same tense psychological mystery-thriller you're in for a hell of a disappointment as it has been diluted so much it might as well be homeopathic The Shining. Oh the characters are there, but it's like this was targeted at a much younger audience, meaning there have to be pointless gun fights, car chases and of course vampires, since they're kinda popular now.Remember how people talked about ""shining"" in vague and uncertain terms? Well forget about that. Now you have a clan of soul-sucking vampires that use shine-fu with specific techniques. You have your astral projection, your possession, your mind control, your illusion, etc. etc. It is no longer an intuition about things unseen, but it is more akin to a power from the X-men. And where would a movie like that be without the ultra powerful but untrained McGuffin child prodigy. Remember how The Shining had a handful of cast that contributed to the feeling of loneliness and isolation? Well this one has a whole tribe of the aforementioned ""vampires"" and a plethora of side characters most of which shine. I call them vampires because they die in the same manner every vampire put to screen over the past 30 years has died - shrivel up, burn, twitch and dissolve into fine mist. Then there's your obligatory gun fight, despite everyone involved apparently having shining powers that can Akira you into oblivion or just Jedi mind trick you into a stupor, but hey, guns are popular with the kids.I can keep tearing this apart as the movie is 3 hours long and provides plenty of cringy material and only a few actually fun callbacks to the source material, but it would be a waste of time. If it was not a sequel the gem it might be a 7/10 but as a sequel it does not fulfill the expectations of the real fans so it cannot be more than a 3/10.Imagine if you took Silence of the Lambs...made a sequel...and in it the Transformers jump in to fight the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park.

The plot is solid, and the last twenty minutes are a great callback for shining fans, but it wastes too much time on unnecessary scenes. A portion of the film focuses on the recruitment of Andi, who then plays no major part in the plot later on and dies unceremoniously, and frankly the movie would have lost nothing if it was cut.Every single transition shot dissolved into the next one, sometimes it was done beautifully, such as when it played on the architecture of the Overlook towards the end, but mostly it did nothing and just added minutes to an already exhausting run time.I feel like the plot could have been two separate movies, one with all the detail about Rose the hat and her friends travelling America eating people with powers, and one movie about an adult Dan Torrance who has to overcome his past trauma and even return to the place that caused it. Trying to cram it all into one film just didn't work.",Doctor Sleep

621,kevinthecritic-15200,Doctor Sleep Prescribes 2.5 Hours of Terror,8,15 November 2019,"4.5 out of 5 stars (one of the best I've seen in a long time)Note: Doctor Sleep contains scenes of alcoholism, child murder, and suicide.Doctor Sleep is one of the best sequels I've ever seen. Like its iconic predecessor The Shining, it's a purposefully slow-paced supernatural horror film more concerned with character development and building an intense atmosphere than it is with jump scares (though they are chillingly effective when present). Add great performances and a script that respects its audience, and Doctor Sleep shines brighter than I ever imagined.Psychic Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) has spent his life attempting to move on from the events of The Shining and overcome alcoholism. Elsewhere, similarly gifted teen Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curren) senses malevolent beings led by Rose the Hat (a star-making turn by Rebecca Ferguson) with insidious plans for powered children. When their paths cross, our heroes must fight to survive and face their inner demons head-on.Doctor Sleep is an absolute classic. Director Mike Flanagan carries over much of the pacing, camerawork, and atmosphere of The Shining while taking the story in new and terrifying directions. If you've never seen the original, stop reading this review and rent it immediately unless you enjoy wallowing in utter confusion. Rebecca Ferguson gives a performance as intimidating, unpredictable, and malicious as Heath Ledger's Joker and McGregor and Curren provide an emotional core around the supernatural craziness. The film has some distracting product placement and less-than-stellar acting in flashbacks, but is otherwise a terrifying gem.Doctor Sleep has an engaging story, reverence for its predecessor, and strong performances that assure its future as one of the great horror classics.

622,JTReviewsPlus,Mike Flanagan Was The Perfect Director For Doctor Sleep,9,12 November 2019,"If Haunting of Hill House wasn't enough to cement this director as one of the best in the genre then Doctor Sleep definitely will. It manages to balance the right amount callbacks, scares, and storytelling. Doctor Sleep does an amazing job staying true to the book while at the same time paying homage to the movie. The story is interesting and can stand out on its own but the easter eggs just add to an already great film. On top of that all the actors do an outstanding jobs at their roles. Don't expect Doctor Sleep to be exactly like The Shining because it isn't. However it is a worthy and entertaining sequel with a modernized interpretation.",Doctor Sleep

And hold up well as a sequel. Excellent casting and pacing. Im happy with the casting. EM was very convincing and didn't overshadow the plot. The supporting cast was excellent. My only negatives are the run time...could have been a bit shorter (10-15 minutes) and the ending for me at least felt underwhelming and failed to deliver the payoff.",Doctor Sleep

626,johnnyutah31,Perfect Balance,9,31 October 2019,"Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I'm happy to tell you it's everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of ""The Shining"" (1980) a cinematic sequel.
Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. ""The Shining"" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.
Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from. Everything struck a balance for me that I was tremendously pleased with, top horror film of the year.",Doctor Sleep

628,ashley-kleynhans,Poor casting of Ewan McGregor but otherwise great,6,1 November 2019,"This would have otherwise been a great film if not for the casting of Ewan McGregor as the now adult Danny Torrance. As much as he tries to put on an American accent, he fails dismally and I found it to be a big put off, since Danny was born and raised by an American family in America, so his out of place accent makes no sense whatsoever. Gerard Butler does a much better job of pulling off the accent than what he does.The rest of the actors do an amazing job, but Ewan McGregor basically ruins the entire movie. They should have found an American actor or one who could at least pull off the accent to be Danny Torrance. Overall his acting isn't bad, I just don't like his accent shining through.",Doctor Sleep

And nostalgia. It was so good. If you are a Shinning fan you must see it. The little details like a bar scene and chasing with an axe makes this movie marvelous. It will take you to the past. It will give you that experience you were craving for. It is not shinning and it will never be good as that masterpiece. But this movie will get under your skin if you are a fan.,Doctor Sleep

Way better then the shining but it carries on from the shining I suppose it's a different generation it is going to be different but it's more about Danny and his shining. Which explains a lot about the shining movie to me. I want to go watch this again. 10/10 for me and my husband. It had gore it had horror, it was so clever written I really hope there is more because I diddnt want this film to end. Can't wait to watch again and again",Doctor Sleep

I have to say the director tried his best and he was pretty successful to make this movie a presentable one . IMDb gave 7.4 out of 10. I will give 9 out of 10. Ewan McGregor we all know a good actor but what Rebecca Ferguson did was great . As she is getting mature she is flourishing more and more . Give her a positive role or a negative role she will make you impressed. Everyone played their characters well but there are two teenage actresses, have impressed me a lot namely Kyliegh Curran and Emily alyn lind . And Cliff Curtis always justified his roles . We all know about the story so I would not like to say anything. Lastly Mike Flanagan is not Stanley Kubrick but he did an excellent work. I wish to see his work more .",Doctor Sleep
633,priyadarshanmaity98,Worthy successor and a great standalone sequel,8,17 March 2020,Doctor sleep - this movie shines pun intended if you want to Learn how to balance two source materials into one and make a respectfull movie which will respect the two auteurs and fans than you got mike Flanagan to teach you this is a visually stunning piece of filmmaking. Mind you this is not your run of the mill horror film with jump scares and all that it is much pshycological and bravely talks about childhood trauma and alcoholism our lead character is battling with these both terms and this is where it belongs to Stephen king and now talking about the direction I think Warner brothers chose the right director to helm this film cause Mike Flanagan has impeccable eye for attention to detail and that he is not imitating Stanley Kubrick he is much more like him because he respects his films where shining is vague and ambiguous here he is answering our questions but again leaving something for us too this is much more accessible approach Mike Flanagan has and I bet If you like shining as much as I do you will love doctor sleep this is the best companion piece any director and his crew has put it on celluloid and the final few minutes are pure nostalgia it is not fan service it is the gradual movement of the story it is not money grabbing tactic it is a smart filmmaking approach and Evan McGregor gives his career best performance and the child actor is also badass and this is the type of horror film where the world building matters every non playable characters has its own development and finally Rebecca Ferguson stole the show from the minute she is on the screen.

Shame on you, IMDB.Since I can come back and edit this, let me just say this for now - You can wait to stream this film. It's not worth a trip to the cinema unless you're a huge SK fan or really got into the novels ""The Shining"" and ""Doctor Sleep"" because this one is both true to the latter to a significant albeit different degree, and a disservice to the former in terms of cinematic accomplishment.I honestly cannot understand any ratings for this lower than 5 or higher than 8 - it just wasn't a polarizing movie in any typical way.

635,athawolsux,"All over the place, and quite a bit stupid",4,22 November 2019,"This movie is pretty much a mess. While it is based on Stephen King's own follow-up to The Shining, the link with the previous movie is not made successfully or compellingly at all. The plot manages to make it so that the sequel nature of the film is largely meaningless and also that viewers who don't know anything about The Shining will end up confused.Apart from the scattershot and rushed feeling of the plot, the most important problem is that while The Shining the movie downplayed the supernatural as opposed to the novel, suddenly in Doctor Sleep there is a huge mythology - one that is not explored or explained very well. In The Shining there were just ghosts who were attracted to ""the shine."" Now there is suddenly a whole lot else, and the links to The Shining quickly devolve into little more than ""hey, remember that scene/thing from The Shining?""The production is akin more to a mid-budget TV series than a movie, and especially the sound effects and visuals accompanying supernatural scenes look and sound really cheap and cheesy. Apart from Ewan McGregor - who does a great job - the acting is quite weak. The main antagonist is not menacing at all and, plus, wears a stupid hat for some reason.

I am still puzzeled by understanding what my worst impression of this visual atrocity is.Is it the especially heinous homicide of Kubrick's cult classic, which has absoluetly no meaningful connection to the original? Is it the transformation of the movie from a mysterious b-grade thriller starring unispired Ewan McGregor, into a garbage superhero movie with absolute trash script and screenplay? Is it the wannabe art cinematography with unrealistic, unexpected and unnecesary CGI scenes?Is it perhaps the pathetically unconvincing performance of Rebecca Ferguson, comparable to a first-timer selling insurance? Or maybe the fact that the idea of a steam-worshiping cult is not the stupidest part of the movie?The sharpest part of the movie was the insanely V-shaped jawline of Emily Alyn Lind, and that speaks for itself.

651,sugar_n_spice_makes_ever,A slow burn of psychological disfigurements,10,11 November 2019,"Well my my my, Doctor Sleep, what a thrilling return to the overlook you were. THIS movie is what you call the proper rights to a slow burn psychological thriller! If you are one who enjoys more jump scares and fast paced, non complicated storylines, then this, my friend, is definitely not for you. So, let's begin; first off, the soundtrack - I've never felt a cinema echo so much in my life. The eerie music that played in the most perfect parts of its scenes sent shivers down my spine! It definitely holds a big part in the movie. Rebecca Ferguson who portrays 'Rose The Hat' is a revelation on so many accounts. She had many different faces and played each one out magnificently. She completely absorbed her role. If she existed, petrified wouldn't even cut it. Her manipulation through her beauty and her ""easy go lucky"" gypsy personality traits deceive her from the innocent eyes; I was in true awe at her scenes of madness and horrific actions. As she, being the villainess, I loved how the writers showed snippets of emotion in her too, we learn that she isn't a completely hollow person and still carries some form of human in her. I haven't seen Rebecca Ferguson play anything out of her depth before, keeping in mind she is already a fab actress but this role, being Rose The Hat, it's gonna make some big changes to her career & she's forever going to be known as this character. The director, Mike Flanagan, brings 'The Shining' right back around in the most incredible way; he finds a way to continue the story and mythology of it all but by keeping its own identity. Ewan McGregor isn't as off the charts and charismatic as Nicholson BUT that's absolutely fine, because the writers were NOT trying to bring Jack back through any other character and I for one am an appreciator of that. This movie, in my eyes, was spun off a different web but still kept to its origins. They made something bigger and better, and both stories collided beautifully.",Doctor Sleep

Also, a great thriller shouldn't rely on sound effects to scare people, they seem excessive in this movie.",Doctor Sleep
655,jeffreyoliverrock,"Different Experience Than The Shining, But Still Worth Watching",8,11 November 2019,"While I don't consider it a masterpiece, I did enjoy the classic Kubrick rendition of The Shining, and I understand why it has the fan base it does. Seeing the trailer for Doctor Sleep and discovering Ewan McGregor was playing an adult Danny Torrance, I thought the concept might be interesting.Everyone acts fantastic in this film. I thought Ewan McGregor built a very nice character. If I had imagined how Danny might have turned out after the first film ended, I don't think I would have predicted it much different. There are a few intense moments with the villains (Primarily Rose the Hat and Snakebite Andi) that made me absolutely hate them (which is a good thing). I think the things they do in the film would make anyone want them to see a terrible fate.I found myself smiling at the call-backs to the classic movie, and when Danny returns to the Overlook Hotel. It's been a while since I've said to myself ""Oh wow, there it is"" that many times at a film. I will say there are a couple scenes at the Overlook that feel like they were written in to make the fan base happy rather than be part of the story, but nothing that drags on too long.As far as it being a scary film, you may jump a few times, and some scenes are a little disturbing, but by Stephen King standards, it's more of a suspense film.An advantage I'll give this film over The Shining is that even though the film is two and a half hours, it doesn't get boring. Not that The Shining was boring, but it is a very slow film. Stanley Kubrick loved to throw in very long shots in his films, and while I personally think they worked sometimes, other times they were excessive, and in The Shining, they were excessive to me.I think this film is at least worth a watch whether you're a fan of the Kubrick film or not, because it's sort of it's own film in a way. It shows enough of the classic film to have a connection, but also has a story different enough and good enough to hold it's own.",Doctor Sleep

The issue isn't with the performance just with the character itself.Rebecca Fergusson was excellent. The rest of the cast also gave good performances but I have an issue with the Jack Torrance replacement.

Her movement, voice, beauty, calm fury are all rich and believable. The child murders committed by her and her family are truly horrific and effectively done.Abra's character is a little too self-assured for a 13 year old, even a smart and powerful one, but I have few complaints about the movie and the characters have stayed with me days after watching.",Doctor Sleep

Rebecca Ferguson carried her own as the sadistic Rose the Hat, but the new actress in the film Kyliegh Curran struggled to keep up with her older cohorts. Her lack of acting ability brought down the film, especially during the third act. The cinematography was decent, with an older-time feel reminiscent of the original. Some great special effects were offset by some suspect ones. The part of the film that worked the most, was in Danny Torrance's (Ewan McGregor) character arc and his moving struggle with addiction. This heartfelt theme saved the movie from being simply another horrible sequel. There were only a few half-hearted scares in the movie, and it was more disturbing than anything else. All in all, I'll give it 6.5 stars out of 10.",Doctor Sleep
672,rowens-38622,WELL DONE!!!,9,2 November 2019,"Even if you only have a brief remembrance of ""The Shining"" this movie stands so well on it's own, and I'm not a big Stephen King fan.",Doctor Sleep

9/10 👭🎩🌬""Doctor Sleep never tries to outdo what Kubrick brought forth in The Shining, however does more than enough to stand it's ground as a worthy sequel with a trusted Mike Flanagan direction.""Fair skepticisms arose when a sequel (Doctor Sleep) to Kubrick's terrifying vision, The Shining, was announced. Stephen King wrote a follow up sequel to his novel, therefore the film adaptation was inevitable because Hollywood. At this point, the only question that stood was would Doctor Sleep be able to live up to the Kubrick level of expectations. As a die hard fan of The Shining, I have this to say: HELL YES IT DID! Man, oh man did Doctor Sleep blow it out of the water. It's easier to say that this movie does just as good as it's own film than just being reliant on Kubrick's movie. Doctor Sleep has a purposeful task on expanding the universe of the known superpower known as ""Shine"". We are presented with the fact that Danny Torrance isn't the only special one this time around as countless others are shown to have this ""Shine"". Unfortunately, to every pro there is a con; in this case The True Knot. The True Knot is quite the not so intimidating sounding group but don't let the name fool you as their intentions are beyond dire. They feed on this ""Shine"" using gruesome and torturous methods that no one could dare stomach. This almost sounds like a type of superhero movie with some horror content because well it kinda is, but don't let that discourage you! Mike Flanagan, the man who brought you Gerald's Game and Haunting of Hill House, knows what he's doing by blending horror into the mix of this situation by masterfully creating an atmosphere, with some of the best cinematography and that classic blue lighting, that could compare to Kubrick's movie. At his advantage, the musical score is a great sidekick once again to further add some anxiety build up for the audience to salivate at. Not only does the film work well with it's atmosphere but uses it's cast quite effectively. Ewan McGregor is an excellent adult Dan Torrance by portraying the paranoid and traumatized character that cannot rid himself of the past. Then there's the wonderful Rebecca Ferguson who portrays the villainous ""Rose the Hat"" as a ruthless character who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. What I also found fascinating about the cast was the recasting for the older characters instead of the previous actors from The Shining as they obviously could not recreate their roles nearly 40 years later (there is a cameo you'll spot quick if you know). They may not be the same faces and voices we are familiarized with however their efforts are noticed at the hand of delivery. All the old and new blends well together in this extravagant follow up and, forgive my inner fan girl, may just be not only my favorite horror movie of the year, but my favorite horror sequel of all time.Verdict: Doctor Sleep does exactly what we all wanted it to do, and isn't what we feared it would be. As worthy sequels go, Mike Flanagan has gifted us with a true horror gem that you for sure will not hate, but either like or love forever and ever and ever.",Doctor Sleep
674,NukeHollywood,"Why? Millennials can't make modern classics, they just can't",5,29 November 2019,"This director, forgot his name, was never going to come anywhere to Stanley Kubrick's standard. And the Dr. Sleep novel was itself not such a great tale but it could have been made into a far better film than this.Even minor Stephen King films like Sleepwalkers or Maximum Overdrive had more genuine appeal than this. Film making has suffered even compared to the drab 90s. It's better than the IT remake though!I did like some of the cinematography, the best point of the film. But the story and acting are not worth repeat watches. It's laughable to think this is a worthy sequel to The Shining.",Doctor Sleep
675,sarahkaye-30024,Perfect follow on from the film-not the book.,8,2 November 2019,"Deviates from the book plot to a huge degree, but it follows on from Kubricks adaptation perfectly.I was not expecting the film to be as grim as it was, there was about five minutes where I literally had to turn away from the screen. Anyone familiar with the book might be wondering if 'baseball boy' will feature in the film-he does. Not the whole storyline, but his own demise. In the book it's only touched upon and no real description of his death is mentioned. In the film they show the young boy being cut apart and tortured, which was too much for me. His screams were horrific and I just didn't need to see a child being torn to pieces-this is the one part of the film I think they got horribly wrong.
Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat was perfect casting, she played the part beautifully. Rose is supposed to be an incredibly beautiful woman, which Rebecca is-but she also plays sinister so well that it's quite unnerving.
I can't say anymore without revealing more spoilers, but I will say, aside from IT, this is probably one of my favourite King adaptations. It's different enough from the book to leave King fans wondering what's going to happen next, but it's got enough of the important points to keep the story essentially the same",Doctor Sleep
676,whineycracker2000,Doctor falls asleep in last act,7,2 December 2019,"Dr. Sleep is a tough movie to recommend without caveat, mainly because of its 3rd act, which seems to have already divided viewers: those who saw it as the director merely reveling in nostalgia when he should have been focusing more on the story, and those who felt that it served a larger purpose beyond that (this reviewer's sentiment). However, the 3rd act *is* problematic, but for other reasons, which I will eventually address.At 3 hours, the film moves steadily enough, even if the slow and hypnotic pacing of Kubrick's film is lacking (although should we really be comparing this to Kubrick at all?). Considering the film's running length, I am inclined to say Doctor Sleep might have made a better mini-series, but all the same, Flannigan makes some very wise, calculated choices to avoid any possible risks common with book adaptations.The actors and performances range from excellent to hit-or-miss. McGregor does a commendable job of showing us the pain accumulated from all of Danny's past trauma, and a lot of the film hinges on his commitment to the role. Newcomer Klieg Curran is excellent in the first two acts but then, like McGregor, loses steam in the 3rd, which makes me wonder if Flannigan was too sidetracked with overseeing the elaborate set-piece recreations of the Overlook and lapsed in his directorial duties. However, it's clear that Curran is going to go on and do great things, especially considering how much the film required her to go to such dark places. And of course, I can't sing enough praise for Rebecca Ferguson's performance, one that she nails effortlessly and practically makes up for any of the film's shortcomings.As I mentioned at the start, the third act is the film's Achille's heel, but not because the story is taken back to the Overlook-again, a common criticism. This aspect works well, as it is merely a way to get us distinctly back inside Danny's head- giving him (and the viewers) the appropriate context and setting to tackle his present demons by venturing into the arena where they originated. The Overlook Hotel is the perfect visual representation for audiences to go on that journey with him. It puts both in that psychological space, and it immediately triggers Pavlovian associations that reveal newer meanings (the bartender scene a great example ). I do not agree with those who insist that this choice was a pointless exercise in nostalgia.No, what breaks the film's stride is the rushed pace and the sudden lack of energy and chemistry between McGregor and Curran's character. For example, there is one moment during a car drive towards the Overlook, where the two are discussing the fate of their loved ones (""I'm sorry about your dad."" ""I'm sorry about your friend"".......really, that's it?) where both actors are so checked out, so devoid of emotion or reflection, I initially thought it was supposed to be a dream sequence. In another moment, Mcgregor asks Curran's character why she is smiling, but her reaction shot reveals she is actually sobbing (!) and yet this is never clarified or addressed. In yet another moment Curran tells her mother (Jocelyn Donahue) that people do go on after death and that her dad is ok. Instead of responding with any kind of acknowledgment of this statement, or any emotion whatsoever, Donahue's facial expression reads something to the effect of ""right on, let's go eat, eh?""These flaws aside, and as long as one does not let the shadow of Kubrick's film hover over them at every turn, Doctor Sleep delivers (Flannigan is easily one of the most reliable writer/directors working in horror today). My reaction to the film can best be summed up by a quote from Roger Ebert's review of Psycho 2 (a movie I consider one of the best sequels ever made), where he stated that the film ""continues the story but not the spell.""",Doctor Sleep

She's one of those child actresses that doesn't make the movie cringy and really did well on her job. The only problem I have is regarding the villians of the movie, I don't know if it's the novel's fault or the writing of the movies.

684,mesaxi,An Awful Cash Grab,3,9 December 2019,"The filmmakers adapted this book for one reason: to cash in on Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"". I emphasize Stanley Kubrick because his movie was NOT a proper adaption of Stephen King's ""The Shining"". The problem with that is the novel Doctor Sleep was a sequel to Stephen King's ""The Shining"", not the Kubrick film. This created a handful of continuity gaps that were very clumsily explained away. The amount of time they spent in this movie saying ""Hey, remember THIS from the Kubrick movie? eh?"" was just nauseating, and told me they had zero faith in the book they were adapting so they had to keep referencing the Kubrick film.Doctor Sleep was an okay novel, not great, and had a classically bad Stephen King ending. When you adapt a flawed novel that gives you the opportunity to smooth over some of the rough edges, correct some of the mistakes. Instead this film just doubled down on the major problems of the novel. Particularly the already bad ending.Something that's common with Stephen King adaptations is the filmmakers saying ""Well this is a Stephen King movie, so it must be a horror"". I don't understand why people think that about King, if you read his books he's not really a horror writer. He has a few, sure, but his genre is Supernatural Thrillers. The need to turn this into a horror lead to some unnecessarily gruesome scenes, as well as erasing some of the lighter-hearted parts of the book. I have a feeling if it weren't for the explanation of the name ""Doctor Sleep"", they would have eliminated the hospital altogether.It wasn't all bad. I feel like the nailed the casting of the members of The True Knot, and they all did what they could with their characters. On the other hand, they cast random people to play Wendy and Jack who looked nothing like Shelley Duvalle or Jack Nicolson and had them do impressions. That was just an awful idea. I don't know if they meant to CGI their faces and forgot or something, but what was left in the movie didn't work at all. The guy who played Dick Hallorann looked good though, he worked.A very forgettable movie.",Doctor Sleep

Movie does rely (a lot) on previous events, meaning you should watch The Shining first, but it is not as half as good, it's not even the same genre.
Dr Sleep is more like an action movie with Marvel-like villains and rushed conversations (especially the one in The Gold Room).They try to recreate many scenes from The Shining but they do not deliver the same feeling nor ambiance. Everything feels rushed, it's like they don't think viewers will have enough patience to sit through this movie.
The main difference, for me, is the villain. While The Shining has that mystery/thriller kinda villain and a creepy, mysterious vibe overall; Doctor Sleep has comic kinda villain.This movie ceirtanly has some modern vibes, unlike the old movies where they knew the story is good and relied on the story. This is like a mix of everything, like Liam Neeson from Taken VS Hela from Thor Ragnarok. It also has strong (lame) vampire vibes and much more.

It seemed more like a fantasy superhero movie than a horror and that's why I give it a big thumbs up.It doesnt go for scare.it didn't care about creeping you out with gory images or any of those sorts. It went straight for the its business of trying to keep the audience's attention for the whole 3 hours and on that,I would say it succeeded because i'm a very difficult person to please.Just ignore all the negative reviews but still go into d movie with low expectations and you'll be glad you did.",Doctor Sleep

Doctor Sleep stands well on its own as a movie, but as a sequel it's amazing. The roles are perfectly cast and it keeps you interested the entire time.

Until the jumpcut to adulthood. After that, it started to feel very different and I didn't feel like I'm watching a movie of the same series.Though, it started to draw me in as it's own experience. With it's own style and merits. That was actually a welcome and unexpected thing; It wasn't riding along just with ""being The Shining sequel"".Though now that I think about it, the movie's feel was a tiny bit all over the place. It went from The Shining, to gritty down-on-his-luck traumatized-character-study, to Sabrina The Teen witch, to Heroes/Supernatural to crime investigation, back to Shining again but this time with a more adventurey vibe ...But even still, I'm not sure if I can fault it for that. The tone changes didn't feel detached from one another and still flowed coherently, so I suppose it's not a mess, but a rollercoaster ride?Right before we get to the very end, I was impressed with how invested it had got me. When the movie got to the part where they arrive at the Outlook hotel, I liked very much seeing the old places again.. but then it started to kinda falter. It had been headed towards a more tongue-in-cheek type of flick that - like one other reviewer said - had this untraditional superhero movie feel to it. Or that I was watching Dr. Strange or something, approaching the final ""boss battle"" scene. Not entirely a bad thing, but at the same time, I was left desiring this ""grit"" I had hoped from The Shining sequel, but instead it kept being sprinkled with this hollywood humor vibe. After all, having just watched Kubric's awesome work with the original, I hoped for that grit.. that style etc. And DEFINITELY left me expecting a horror movie a whole lot more than a ... monster/ghost movie.I haven't however read the book, so I can only compare it to the original if anything and/or rate it as a standalone movie.Had the ending been stronger and less cliché feel-good-ish, I would've given this an 8 - and first did.

695,nunocharles75,A Classic Hijacking,6,2 August 2020,"Getting the obvious out of the way; The original was much better done. Although ""The Shining"" referred to the power to see beyond and communicate telepathicly, Kubrick was skillful and mindful enough not to put this front and center of the movie. The spirit of the original was more psychological and suspenseful, focusing on Jack losing his mind due to isolation and succumbing to the negative energy of the hotel. Using the ghosts of the hotel more as an outside influence than the actual plot.
""Doctor Sleep"" is just a standalone horror flick borrowing aspects of the original to avoid having to fill in gaps, which could make an already long movie even longer. It's not a terrible movie. I'd probably put it close to the same pace of the movie ""It"". Not terrible, but has a tendency to get cheesy at times. The original never got cheesy. It stayed dark. Very dark.

Many people already know that Stephen King isn't a fan of Kubrick's adaptation of his work, so this movie not only had to please the fan base of the book but also had an impossible task of being a sequel to one of the best horror movies ever made, sounds quite agitating, right? With them recreating some of the scenes and recasting some of the characters I thought it'd throw me off, but it didn't and I gotta say everyone knocked it out of the park.The director does a brilliant job of maintaining an engaging narrative and making his mark on the film while paying homage to its predecessor.Mike Flanagan is undoubtedly one of the best horror movie directors working today. Those who are following his career would know that he has a unique way of story-telling. Unlike other directors in this particular genre, he doesn't heavily rely on jump scares rather focuses on the characters. This one is also no different than his other work. Doctor Sleep focuses on psychological aspects of Dan Torrance played by Ewan McGregor, who is still traumatized by his childhood experience and the young girl Abra Stone played by Kyliegh Curran, who also possesses psychic powers called ""the shining"" like Dany. And there's a cult of psychic vampires called the True Knot, led by Rose the Hat played by Rebecca Ferguson that feeds on people with psychic powers. The interesting thing here is the story doesn't forget to show the side of the villain, which horror movies usually don't.I saw the director's cut which is about 3 hours long. The run time may seem too long for many people, but it didn't bother me that much. The first half is a bit slow which I do think is necessary and gives us some time with the characters and chance to know them better. Everyone in this movie does an outstanding job, especially the young girl Abra Stone. Kyliegh Curran is such a brilliant actress and she really shines in this movie. Ewan McGregor managed to capture the troubles of having a traumatized childhood and what can lead to that. Rebecca Ferguson with her menacing charisma gives a terrifying performance.The movie deals with addiction and overcoming past trauma. It has a riveting storyline with a lot of layers in it and amazing cast and their performances and a talented director behind helped it to become one of the best horror movies of 2019 and a worthy successor to The Shining.

706,storyteller-69195,"Very well done, but undone by a terrible ending",6,26 January 2020,"This is the rare film that has a worse ending than the source Stephen King novel.One of the real problems with many of Mr. King's longer novels is that the power of his imagination exceeds his ability to pay off the story he created. (SPOILERS) The most egregious example can be found with ""IT"" (GIANT SPIDER FROM SPACE) and the longest shaggy dog joke known to man, ""The Dark Tower""(""you wasted your time coming this far because the wheel of ka turns and turns and everything you went through with the characters was for nothing!"").The novel Dr. Sleep was one of King's more solid efforts of the last 20 years, and as noted in the headlines, had a far more successful, exciting, and satisfying ending than the film.The film itself, overall, was solid. Very nice performances (esp by Rebecca Fergueson and Cliff Curtis), the scares were more creepy than gross and much of the awfulness happened off screen. The throw-backs to the Kubrick film ""The Shining"" were well done (see the actress playing Wendy Torrence).But the ending was junk, cobbled together from the novel The Shining, and it made the hero Danny Torrence kind of a putz, as if they channeling the weakest of King's own endings.Worth a watch since the Director is so talented, but, damn, what a disappointment at the end.",Doctor Sleep
707,cameratagirl,Wakey Wakey,9,8 March 2020,I was a little hesitant to spend close to 3 hours with this movie but....Wow. This was an absolutely fabulous film. I like a good horror but it needs more content than just cheap scares. Which leads us to....DOCTOR SLEEP. A story. A real kick-ass story with plenty of twists along the way.

This doesn't rise to crimes against humanity levels. But is bitterly disappointing nevertheless. Hoped for better.",Doctor Sleep
712,trevorchamberlain-63352,the problem of the the burning hotel,3,12 March 2020,"You could not expect to find a better example of craftsmanship in Hollywood today then Doctor Sleep. It is in every aspect a very well made and more then decently acted horror film and that is what is wrong with it.Doctor sleep is based on a Novel by Stephen King which is sequel to his novel The Shining which was made into a film by Stanly Kubrick and their is the problem. While Mike Flanagan's film is a vary good film it's a perfectly ordinary one. Kubrick was an extraordinary director and The Shining is amongst his most extraordinary works.There are other problems, very serious ones, firstly king hated the original Shining intensely. He particularly hated Kubrick's interpretation of the books central character Jack Torrence. By the end of the original novel Torrence has found redemption by trying to refuse the hotel's evil plans and being unable to stop it burning down. In Kubrick's film he does no such thing and the possibility of redemption is not granted. King in his main criticism of the film likened it a shiny new machine with no engine inside. The engine in the book is Jack Torrence's moral struggle. Jack is a writer who has yet to have a publishing career. Working in the Overlook hotel for the winter will give him the opportunity to write and to take advantage of the fascinating history of the place for inspiration. He is also a a violent alcoholic who's actions has got him fired from his previous post of English teacher. His violent behavior when drunk has affected his marriage, he has even harmed his own son Danny in an uncontrollable moment. He is still a man able to make correct rational choices and the Overlook hotel will be he believes a turning point for the better. The hotel has other plans of course but in Stephen Kings Novel Torrence is a man who could go ether way. What really pains the novelist is that Kubrick never gives Torrance the possibility of that chance and that is particularly painful because King has over identified with his central character. The Shinning was published in 1977 when king was himself having problems with alcohol and substance abuse. He could certainly remember being a struggling writer even if Carrie was a best seller and a successful film. The past and to close. King had put a lot into the shining and Kubrick torn it up and taken over the story.So Torrence is king and Kubrick's interpretation of his character was a stinging slap in the face because it was a judgment upon his own self worth. It still is a slap in the face because Kubrick's film, even after forty year is still the best and the most critically valued and for audiences the most memorable of all the interpretations of his work. The book and the film of Doctor Sleep was seen by King as a chance to diminish the Kubrick's film and to take control back from it and to steer popular public perception back towards his own.Kings own view of Jack Torrance has changed over the years. This has not been King's first attempt to readjust the novel's film history, he has been extremely vocal about his distaste for the Kubrick film. The wrote the script for a television version of The Shining in 1997, he approved of the director Mick Garis who had worked with king before and he even appeared in the production. The result was disastrous. Limited in every way by a smaller budget and by having to closely follow king's own script. Director and Script writer working in unison made all the wrong decisions about how to adapt a book to the screen. Seen together they show how superior Kubrick's vision of cinema is. Kings own view of Torrence had changed in the twenty years between the book and the TV series. In the novel Jack is gifted one final moment of lucidity at the end when he warns Danny to flee the hotel because he can no longer control his murderous impulses. Danny doesn't go and his fate appears to be sealed when the Hotel regains control, until Danny reminds Jack and the hotel that the boilers are about to blow in it's basement. The hotel burns to the ground destroying it's power and Jack dies in the blaze still under it's will but helpless to change events. In the television series Jack, now in control of himself at the end, allows the boilers to explode destroying the Hotel and himself in a final act of redemption.Compare this with the end of Doctor Sleep, in fact take another look at how the film deals with Danny's alcoholism. Doctor Sleep is mainly set in the present day. Dan was grown up and turned into Ewan McGregor. He has hidden away the individual horrors of the hotel in a series of imaginary boxes but he has lived a life of alcoholism and substance abase until the last eight years. Having settled down and joined alcoholics anonymous just as king did. We see Dan clean Shaven and smartly dressed, declare his lengthly sobriety to the group as King must have done. As the plot darkens we see Dan reject temptation with a bottle of spirits in his hand and to labor the point, Flanagan and king who I suspect in having some influence on the rewrites, has Dan walking into the Gold room of the Outlook hotel no less, to be served and consistently reject a drink from his father now serving as the hotel's bartender, devils advocate and inner voice of alcoholic dependency. Like his father Dan has a past to regret, turning his back on the young boy of an female addict while emptying her purse, he is redeemed by his mentoring and protecting of a young padwan, I'm sorry, of Abra, a super shining young girl.The last chapter has all the remaining characters returning to the grounds of the hotel, in original book this has burnt down taking Jack with it, in the original film jack is left in the maze while the hotel stands. The film of Doctor sleep, follows the film of the shining. But it borrows it's ending from first the book because the possessed and Axe wielding Dan ruining though the hotels corridors in pursuit of Abra has a moment of clarity in which to tell Abra to run away before being taken over again. Abra like Danny before her reminds the hotel that Dan left the boiler ofull on but unattended. By the time Dan makes it to the boiler room he has enough self precession to allow the hotel to burn down, which is following not the book but the television series. Creatively Kubrick's film after all these years is still a burning fire inside his own head. The Dan of the film gets to tie up everything Stanley has undone, he gets to redeem himself and his father at the same time. There for hopefully canceling Kubrick's influence with the public who have for the last forty years read Kings written word though Kubrick's visual experience.In spite of a career writing horror stories Stephen King does describe himself as a warm hearted man, something that he clams extends to his feelings towards the characters that he invents. He describes Kubrick as being to cold and analytical as a personality and as a film maker unable to connect emotionally with the characters in his work and unable to believe in the ghosts that haunt the hotel. Doctor sleep ends with Dan and Abra discussing their future together and with Abra reassuring her mum that death is not final and we do go on. But the icy chill that emanates form every moment of Kubrick's film is the very key to it's success. What ever is there in the hotel is very frightening, very real and still very present. Nothing is resolved at the end, the hotel simply absorbs back into its self, waiting. Perhaps that is why when to the tune of Berlioz's symphony we wind our way up the mountain again, the film aways seems to be waiting for us.""What will it be today Mr Torrance""
""Hair of the dog that bit me Loyd,""No expense has been spared to expertly copy the look of the hotel to the smallest detail but absolutely nothing has been done to engage with the intellect that conceived of it. Doctor Sleep is among a growing number of films that seem content to exist with the shell of another. I am not thinking of free ranging parodies like Spielberg's Ready Player One which takes us around the hotel set and main hall. That's simply another 80's reference, we observe it and move on. The latest Star war films, the newest Terminator and Blade Runner films are a different matter. They exist primary to engage with our sense of nostalgia for a product, not an era. There is nothing new about a squeal, of course but these latest films seem to be more obsessive. They are born of the television age, when for the first time, the whole history of cinema is available to the viewer; the video age when films can be stopped and started and watched again and again and the DVD age when films can be viewed in excruciating detail and never ending perfection. The Millennium falcon has been copied to the smallest rivet and we, or our surrogate can go flying of with Han Solo and Chewbacca again. To boldly do nothing that hasn't been done before. What little warmth these projects have is created almost purely from our own recognition.This is not the first time it has happened to Kubrick. In his own life time he saw it happen to 2001. When the studio made 2010 a vastly inferior film that takes us right into the set of the Discovery and finds Dave Bowman just a little bit older then his former self and oscillating back and forth from youth, old age and fetus but not really doing anything he hasn't done before because all these films are on permanent recycle.
The first part of Doctor Sleep is very much it's own thing and Ewan McGregor performance is very far from anything Nicholson was asked to do. Then we travel up the mountain road and arrive in a video game called Overlook, wonder were you will around this immaculate facsimile but don't expect it to have the same charge as the original.In the end king lost out, not many people came to see Doctor Sleep, but the original lives on and haunts our imagination.",Doctor Sleep
713,gsumpterfl,Good but...,6,17 December 2019,"It was a great premise. However, I felt like it could go a bit deeper. It seemed like the story was wading in shallow waters of a kiddy pool but the story was so good so I kept expecting a slip into the deep end that didn't come.

My biggest complaint would be the movie is too long, and it feels that way. Not that it's not well acted or written, but that it is a very dialogue heavy film and their isnt much pace change to really break up the first few hours. I think anyone familiar with the material though will appreciate how it ends.",Doctor Sleep

716,rubellan,"A stone cold classic, and on par with The Shining",10,13 November 2019,"I don't know what it is with people. They just want the same Marvel Comics story told over and over again. Oh, how boring. Hearing Doctor Sleep wasn't the box office hit it was expected wasn't surprising to me. Why? Because it's a great film! Regardless of the movie's running time, I was never bored. While the story is its own entity, it ties in very nicely with The Shining. Although I do agree with some others that one particular death scene was just too brutal and disturbing, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.The ending of the film kind of choked me up. As I mentioned to who I saw the film with, I saw The Shining in the theater when I was 10 years old in 1980, and have seen it countless times over the years. So to see it wrapped up as it was, it was kind of bitter sweet but completely logical, and I felt it elevated the movie even further. It sort of felt like a friend or family member was passing on.The movie stuck with me and will no doubt be a classic for years to come as people who don't see it in the theater discover it on their chosen home video platform. It wasn't about jump scares, it was about atmosphere and storyline, and unfortunately that appears to be too cerebral for most average viewers.I researched what the differences were between the book and the movie, and they are significant. I can say after reading, I think all of the changes in the movie were for the better. Stephen King like's to have some sort of rose-colored slant to a lot of his themes but I personally feel it cheapens the scare factor. I'm grateful to Mike Flanagan for making this movie the way he did. I was impressed with it and cannot wait to see it again. Put down those silly comic book movies and go see something that took some real effort and creativity.",Doctor Sleep

718,Ilovemoviesalot,"Captured the look, but not quite the feel of the book",7,3 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep has been my most favourite book of the last few years. So I was very excited to see the big screen version. Just like It part 1, this movie has captured the look of the Stephen King world beautifully. Casting has been good, Ewan McGregor as the understated tortured soul, Ferguson suitably enigmatic, looking both beautiful and dangerous. Though i enjoyed the movie, I did not quite get the same thrills as I experienced from the book. I have slight issues with the following -
1. Adult Ewan McGregor's character development was a little rushed - the book I felt did this very nicely.
2. The baddies looked suitably bad, but never really looked supernaturally bad. They sort of looked like ordinary villains, I sensed no aura of danger from them.
3. While I understand why the director felt compelled to follow some scenes from Cubrick, I think he could have explored new angles and approaches in the final part of the movie.
4. The music felt a little put upon in places.
That's my moaning complete :). Overall a solid 7/10. It is nice to see that King books are attracting good directors and actors and are being made into decent movies at last.",Doctor Sleep

720,thomasheaney,Not what you might think as a sequel from Shining,7,12 June 2020,"Lets start with the basics - Originally written for my Dad.This is a Stephen King book adaptation that was a sequel to the Shining, it follows the son from the original film/book now being an adult. He has had to deal with a fair few issues, trying to deal with his ""shine"". After moving away to escape his issues, he is thrown into a series of events that are stranger than you might think, even considering it is a sequel to the Shining.
The cinematography is shot in a consistent and powerful style, with a hypnotising yet forgettable soundtrack. That is apart from the recurring sound of a heartbeat, that successfully adds to the tension of the film. Towards the end, the imagery is slightly too repetitive, trying to link it with the original.
This film lends itself to the supernatural side, following more closely to the book, so do not expect the ""grounded"" level of the original film. It is reasonably fun to watch, with a range of ""light"" gruesome aspects and a decently good story.
Towards the end of the film you see its strengths and weaknesses, leaning heavily on nostalgia from the original. Still it is a useful and nostalgic trick that just about fits, give or take.Overall 6.9/10",Doctor Sleep

And Rose the hat and Abra had a connection through telepathy to meet each other ??? I really wanted to see that scene.Another detail: In the book, Billy was stunned in his pick-up truck by Crow and should be unconscious in the car with Abra during the abduction.

I understand that it is difficult to input this book into 2 and a half hours but you'd better not do it at all if the result is crippling the the whole story. Missing major characters and major events is not acceptable.Second, typically for Hollywood the cast is very inappropriate. Except from Rose the Hat none of the others is suppose to be extremely good looking. It shouldn't be a fashion show.Third, I understand that Hollywood is trying to fight racism with changing some characters which originally are white to be black. In my opinion it is contra-productive and the only lead to loosing some of the story's elements.Fourth, smoothing some of the sexual and violence parts is making it a children's movie.

It feels like Blade meets Interview with a Vampire meets The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus meets Stranger Things meets Twilight. It's too commercial: a ramped up teen movie that has a splash too much of horror to be for teens, and an insufficient grown up movie that lacks the depth and realism of what movie fans crave. It also feels like there are 2 movies going at the same time, one is good, one is childish.It's a 3hr movie that fails to hook from the start, however extensive the scene decors look like, and fails to deliver a plausible well-delivered story, however supernatural it might be.It's a movie to watch to say you have watched it, and a movie to suggest to friends that have nothing else to watch, so they can say they watched it.",Doctor Sleep

I think what I'm picking up on is that there is someone quite smart deliberately making money, but they're not making it by targeting me; they're targeting people a lot younger.Maybe as a child I could have appreciated this and thought it was wonderful, but even then I'm not so sure. I still think I wouldn't like it.This is a new trend in movies, particularly Stephen King movies, where everything is targeted at teenagers.

Mike Flanagan, a great director, should have shown the same restraint in this film. It wasn't necessary.

743,sallyannandrew,Good but conflicting,7,13 November 2019,"This was a very conflicting film for me. I have read both 'The Shining' and 'Doctor Sleep' and loved both books for different reasons. I also count Kubrick's 'The Shining' as one of my favourite films. I had heard though that, given the enormous popularity of Kubrick's film, and the fact that more people would be familiar with that than the original book, this was to be a sequel more in line with the original film, than with the original story. So based on that (although I had to see it because I am a completist) I didn't walk into this expecting to enjoy it. Good film adaptations of Stephen King's books are few and far between.Perhaps because my expectations were so low, I then ended up being pleasantly surprised and really quite enjoying this. Doctor Sleep is a big book, with lots of characters, quite a few consecutive narratives and a lot of detail. Those who wrote the screenplay did a good job I thought of 'trimming the fat'. For most of the film, the basic structure of the original story is held together but not tampered with significantly which I appreciated, I could get nerdy and whinge about a few things but I won't. I don't mind when things are left out, it's a necessity - books are considerably longer than films. I DO hate it when things are changed though, which is why I did not love the ending of this film.As we get towards the end, things go off on a bit of a tangent in order to follow on from Kubrick's film. The proper ending of Doctor Sleep is abandoned in favour of a final showdown at and with the Overlook. I have all kinds of problems with this and how it was handled. I suppose if I was coming to this film as a fan of Kubrick's film and not having read either book, I might have appreciated the ending more. However I have read the books, and I would have done things differently.Ultimately, this is pretty good, the cast is great (even if Rose the Hat and Crow Daddy are just a little bit younger in the film than they should be). I found the ending disappointing, but it's certainly one of the better adaptations of a King book I have seen. If you are going to watch this having no connection to any of the source material or have just seen Kubrick's film, this is probably a very good high-brow horror film.",Doctor Sleep

745,Pielola,Different. Great Story,8,31 October 2019,"Just came back from the prescreening. This sequel went in a totally new direction but still had elements that tied it to The Shining. Starts out a little bit of everywhere and wasn't sure where it was headed but it definitely starts to pick up in a whole new direction. For a sequel to one of the best classic films, it did great. I had high expectations because of Mike Flanagan but was unsure cause it's living up to The Shining and it was better than that. I'd say watch it, it was refreshing but familiar !",Doctor Sleep
746,darkolazicbg,"Not Shining, not Kubrick",10,4 November 2019,"As for story, it follows the book well. It is NOT shining and those who didnt read the book will not like it.It is NOT a HORROR.

747,karenevers-49804,An Absolute Masterpiece!,9,15 November 2019,"Did we need a sequel to The Shining? Mike Flanagan's Doctor Sleep sure makes a great case for one.Doctor Sleep follows Danny Torrance after the events of the original film as he tries to lock his fears away with heavy drinking. He gets his life in order thanks to a kindly new friend and that's right when the terror starts to return. Danny isn't the only one with the gift of ""the shining"" and there are tons of wicked people who are always on the prowl for such people so that they can suck the life force out of them to sustain themselves and live longer than the average mortal.Soon, Danny begins having a telepathic link to a young girl with similar abilities and they band together to solve a murder and figure out who's responsible.If you're wondering what this has to do with The Shining, I can't blame you. Tonally, it's so different that you might be wondering where it's going, but the climax at the Overlook Hotel will make it well worth waiting for as several memorable ghosts and ghouls return to wreak havoc.Performances are fantastic across the board with Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson making the biggest impact as Danny and the wicked Rose the Hat. New actors have been brought in to bring Wendy, Jack, and Halloran back to life for a few moments and the results are downright uncanny.If you're expecting a masterpiece of extended dread like the original, you might leave disappointed, but if you're willing to throw away any expectations, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. Doctor Sleep feels less like another chapter in The Shining and more like another chapter in Danny's life complete with new characters, new settings, and new obstacles. In that way, it's an awful lot like life.",Doctor Sleep

The Director's cut clocks in at over 3 hours and is a beautiful slow burn horror epic that fans of both Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick will applaud.Be warned... There are some pretty harrowing scenes in this movie, so it might be everyone's cup of tea.That said, the acting is fantastic, especially from Ewan McGregor, and the production and attention to detail is top notch. It's not perfect, there are a few scenes that are less impactful than others, and perhaps some editing issues here and there. The ending is not quite as satisfying as I would have liked it to be.It isn't a Stanley Kubrick movie by any stretch, but it does succeed in evoking the essence of The Shining without pandering too much. The fan service is all here, but it doesn't detract from the wholly new elements that have been introduced. Highly recommended!",Doctor Sleep
754,wongcalvin,Great And Fantastic Sequel,9,11 November 2019,"Comparing to this and its predecessor, it kinda live up to the hype well in terms of style, the set design, the eerie atmosphere, casting and its score. This movie is had practically less jump scare compared to other horror movies in this decade and it uses the art direction of the camera, atmosphere and music itself to create a sense of tension and it sucks you in right into the movie. Also pay attention to its colour scheme matching and most of the times the actors and actress wears teal green colour clothing and match with the background and environment which is mostly orange and it is found throughout the whole movie. Feels kinda satisfying they matched up all the colours with the moods.This movie felt absolutely terrifying and immersive at some point and its exactly what horror movie these days lacks of, which mostly just jump scares to throw you off your chair and its just cheap movie. But this adaptation just blends everything well and on top with Stephen King's story line its just made a pretty darn good movie. The story line had more depth and more immersive compared to the first one and I love the few camera trick shot used in this film its fantastic!Overall, its a great movie, fun, intriguing, interesting, eerie and terrifying in many ways!",Doctor Sleep

The story from The Shinning (1980). Well, have you ever thought what happened to Danny & His Mom after The Shinning (1980). It may seems like a spoiler actually it isn't cause this movie based on different storyline. And IMDb mentioned it in the storyline.Trust me I watched 1 hour 54 minutes without giving any pause or break whatsoever. This movie entirely got me, it was a joy ride. The storyline and acting was very strong, didn't find any glitch. Before watching I checked IMDb storyline and I was sanguine that this movie won't be a disappointment. Finally after watching I can ensure you one thing that you won't regret about it.#Storyline: This movie is about a boy called Danny. He was born with a gift ; he can see what other people thinking about him moreover what is going to happen near in the future especially if someone is dying. Hopefully there is another girl call 'Adra'who has the same gift. She can go to other people's head. But things went wrong when their hunter found them. Now they are coming to get the girl. What will happen to the girl?There's some beautiful things I enjoyed about this movie like when someone is dying a Cat can sense it. The Cat was looking at the victim's eye without a blink, it's not scary but it was something different i found in this movie.Rose (Rebecca Ferguson) oh she was marvellous in this movie, can't believe she is 36 but she looked like 21. Her acting was very appealing, she made every action perfectly. Danny aka Ewan McGregor (protagonist) was wonderful. I Don't want to say more about him cause he was the life of this movie. That little girl Adra was pretty astonishing. She acted very well.The vfx aka visual effects was very good. Every scene of this movie seemed perfect could can't deny it. I was pleased with every thrilling step of this movie. It's a thriller movie so you will know everything after watching the full film.A movie you shouldn't miss.

I watched the director's cut and the story for me was just not engaging enough. This 3 hour version has its moments but as a whole movie I will use just one word, boring.The cinematography is pretty good and actually made the movie bearable. Rebecca Ferguson was also nice.

758,fryguy-88668,Solid but not great,7,25 November 2019,"First, some positives. Ewen McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson were stellar. As others have said, the ending differs radically from the book but was quite good in its own right. The not so good...the Abra character fell flat. Not going to criticize a young actress. I think this falls on the director. The performance was on the stiff side but I think that was due more to how the character was developed than to the actress. The actor that played Dick Hallorann was eerie in physical resemblance and voice to Scatman Crothers yet none of the compassion of the original character came through. Overall a solid adaptation with some hits and misses.
SPOILERS AHEAD
If you haven't read the book and plan to...stop now. First let me say this is my favorite Stephen King book since It. Very difficult to adapt Stephen King as so much of his writing involves characters' inner thoughts and feelings. Two thumbs up on Danny and Rose the Hat. Abra was a miss. The movie did not capture her warmth and passion. In a book this long, cuts have to be made. Some made sense and some things would have made it better. Sad that Momo wasn't in it but that probably had to go for time. Same with combining Danny's friend Billy and his sponsor character. The True Knot could have been better developed very simply...1-2 brief scenes to show how connected they are rather than Danny's one line of dialogue. Should have had a few more members as well. I also thought Dr John could have been in a couple more scenes without lengthening the movie. Two final details that diminished it...the story of ""the baseball boy"" having measles, thus putting the True Knot in desperation mode. And Danny's haunting memory of Deenie and her baby. The way that gnawed at him in the book gave him depth and could have been simply included. So, as always with the book, I thought it could have been better...but still it was solid mostly due to Ewen McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson, and a pretty good original ending.",Doctor Sleep
759,Tony-Alexander125,Too Many Things Going On,4,4 November 2019,With no actual clear 'hero' goal and absoultely too much 'power' bestowed upon the young prodigy this film for what is two and a half hours is too confusing.

In an excess of caution, I marked this review as containing spoilers because I'm revealing that fact, although I don't think it really counts as a ""spoiler"" because the scene I'm referring to happens in the first half the film and doesn't affect the ending. It will be unacceptable to some viewers, though -- parents in particular -- and I'm concerned to see that mainstream Hollywood movies have crossed over into material like this. It's gratuitous and kind of sick, even if it's accurately drawn from the novel.That aside, the film is an interesting attempt to recall and expand on ""The Shining,"" and by that I mean mostly Kubrick's film, not King's original story, which apparently can no longer be visualized apart from Kubrick's deathlessly striking images. There is one particularly sad scene that was obviously written to be performed by Jack Nicholson, which would have been great, but apparently they couldn't get him or couldn't meet his price. So it's just kind of sad. Basically, the whole movie is a backhanded tribute Kubrick in that it reminds us what a genius he was by comparison with these filmmakers.",Doctor Sleep
761,silvijapalosek,Watch it for Rebecca Ferguson and Rebecca Ferguson alone,6,31 January 2020,"To be honest, I was interested in this because Ferguson is one of my favourite actresses and she was charismatic in this one indeed. Not really scary, but charismatic. Well done for her.Now, I don't like horror films at all. They scare the living hell out of me, but even I was shocked at how un-scary this movie was. It was more on a psychollogical thriller/fantasy side, it tried so very hard to be suspensful and it managed that a few times. But nothing terrifying really. Only the woman in the bathtub and one nasty scene involving a child actor were somewhat disturbing. Sometimes even parodic.For me it wasn't the length of the film that was bothersome. I like slow films but literally nothing happened in this one. It was so bland and emotionless, I couldn't care less for the characters. The point of this film is beyond my comperhension. Memorable things are : villains, cinematography, few dialogue lines. McGregor is just okay.

A victim to a whole slew of vices, he finds a reason for redemption upon discovering a kid who has similar powers. Unfortunately, the new kid is a complete Mary Sue.
The film begins with much promise and the villains play their part quite well (except when up against the Mary Sue, whereupon they become clueless buffoons). You know she's always going to win... because plot armor.

From there on, the little boy who could 'Shine' went through all trauma & paranormal experiences one could possibly experience and they have not stopped haunting him till date. As the next and final chapter of Stephen King's novel, comes Doctor Sleep, set up in today's world with more evil forces around!Danny (Ewan McGregor) after receiving the settlements from the Overlook Hotel, spends his days with Alcohol for long. With the help of a friend he manages to find a place to live and a job at a Hospice care. Due to his abilities, he gets fondly called as Doctor Sleep. He incidentally is being contacted by Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), a girl with psychic powers. Abra is able to discover a group of cult called the True Knot who prey on people with such special powers. Abra seeks Danny's help to put an end to that group. Meanwhile, a member of the group, Rose (Rebecca Ferguson) finds out about Abra and her abilities and the cult group is in pursuit of Abra. Whether Danny is able to help Abra and stop Rose is the plot.What makes Doctor Sleep stand out from the rest of the horror movies released this year is its ability to keep the audience glued at the 'cat and mouse' game between The True Knot and Abra. Also this movie is high on the thriller quotient which makes it even more interesting to watch. While one would expect the little girl to give up, she in turn terrorises the cult group. Kyliegh Curran portraying Abra Stone steals the show hands down. The last few minutes shot at the Overlook Hotel bringing in the nostalgia of The Shining is captured so well. Room 237, the broken bathroom door, the twin girls, the old lady, the maze garden, the bar etc have been recreated with Danny as the focus. The deepfake of Jack Nicholson is a bonus for the audience.Totally worth a theatrical watch.",Doctor Sleep

772,thefreneticist,Surprisingly impressive,8,27 January 2020,"I am one of those weirdos who actually likes Stephen King movies (partly because I have been reading his novels since my friends were reading Fear Street), but even I know to keep my expectations open, generally speaking.
But honestly, Doctor Sleep stunned me, as it moved from scene to scene; well directed, well scripted, well acted and making fantastic use of location (including returning us to the now long closed, distinctly dilapidated but no less dangerous Overlook Hotel, which has lost none of its menace or iconic impact), as well as including that mainstay of Stephen King's works, a middle-aged man shadowboxing with an unhealthy crutch, this film felt like undeniably one of cinema's better passes at his work.Almost no-one is going to admit that it's a worthy successor to The Shining, but that's because that parent film has become so seminal a figure on the landscape of modern horror that it has taken on mythic status that is even more than the indisputably admirable sum of its parts. No new film is ever going to live up to the shadow cast by a cultural icon, no matter how technically good it is.
It's an unfair burden to put on Doctor Sleep.But is it accurate to say that this movie is far, far, far better than it had any real right to be, or than almost anyone expected of it? Absolutely.
The story is compelling, the horror is...well, horrific. The violence elicits that visceral wrench that is the kneejerk response of truly well-executed cinematic pain - and all done with comparitively little gore. The threat presented by the villain element is genuinely nightmarish, tapping into multiple primal human fears simultaneously, while the main characters - particularly young deuteragonist Abra - are engaging, while maintaining sufficient nuance and weaknesses to keep them feeling like potentially real people.
If Doctor Sleep has one big failing that keeps me from giving it a 9-star rating, it is this; that for all the sinister nature that our Big Bad is portrayed as representing, in the end, the showdown between unstoppable force and immovable object can't live up to the hype, and concludes somewhat quickly, and arguably anticlimatically. The villain story feels somewhat rushed - though they get more screentime than most, and the unexplained dramatic potential is undeniable; one can't help but feel that with more questions raised than answered, Doctor Sleep should really have been given the added working room of a TV series run, at least one season's worth.That aside, it's pretty damn good. I'd call it a solid B+. If you enjoyed The Shining, and found the premise of this sequel piqued your interest, or even if you were just stirred by the trailer, I encourage you to give it a chance on your next Friday night in or lazy Sunday.

They reuse original footage from The Shining and touch it up with cgi snow and hotel damage. The soundtrack and sound design is ripped straight from the film. It constantly uses dissolve edits without understanding why and when Kubrick would.

STOP EXPOSING THE ANTAGONIST TOO MUCH IT TAKES THE SCARY OUT OF THEM. One of the best parts of shining is the dad. Jack, is scary in the movie with the way he acts. But THE HAT LADY IS NOT SCARY. This is due to exposing the true knot too much and well, you can't put Rebecca Ferguson in a movie and call it scary. You need to have someone who is capable of that. Other then that, the little girl was fine, except the wig scene. WTF. This is probably Mike Flanagan's weakest film after Before I wake. Ouija and Haunting of Hill House is more than recommended.

788,lbc-46835,Excellent film!!,10,14 November 2019,"I loved this movie. It has big shoes to fill being not just a sequel but an adaptation of a really good book. It was also impressive because it managed to successfully reconcile the difference between the book, The Shining and the film and stay true to both.
The sets for the Overlook Hotel were meticulously reconstructed and characters recast from the original film were portrayed in such a way that one would think it was the original actor starring in Doctor Sleep.
I really liked the young actress that plays Abra as well as Ewan McGregor and Rachel Ferguson as Danny and Rose the Hat.
Great film and I can't wait to see it again.",Doctor Sleep

790,trailer_trashed89,Some Films Don't Need Sequels,6,2 November 2019,"If you go into this film expecting it to be anything like Stanley Kubrick's 1980s masterpiece of horror, you will leave disappointed. Let's just start there.Little Danny Torrence is now a grown man, and still haunted by the things that happened to him at the Overlook Hotel when he was a kid (understandably). Most days he drinks his hours away to silence the voices in his head. On a whim he travels to a new town and wile there, gets his life together, and meets a young girl Abra, who 'Shines' just like he does. Against his will he ends up protecting her from a group of powerful psychics, lead by Rose the Hat, who hunt young children with psychic powers in order to feed on them to make themselves live forever. In order to keep Abra safe Danny is forced to return to the overlook hotel and face his ghosts, in ore ways than one.Generally, this isn't a BAD film. It's entertaining enough. The problem is, it's following one of the most iconic horror movies ever made and it hard to forget that. There are a few great nods to the original, using both cinematography and sets and props to jog the memory of anyone who ever saw the original movie, so that's fun. But the plot is a little slow for me and lacked punch.Sadly most of this film was just...meh. It lacked the nail biting atmosphere that 'The Shining' had in spades. It lacked a lot of fear of any kind really. The recurring visuals (The naked Lady in the Bathtub for example) that were meant to be scary, by the end just induced eye rolls form me and while the acts of Rebecca Ferguson and her group of cannibalistic psychics were horrific, they weren't really scary. After the amazing experience of watching 'The Shining' last week in the theatre, watching 'Doctor Sleep' was just disappointing. I expected more.You do wait the whole film to see Danny return to the Overlook, and then when we finally get there, its anti-climactic and not really worth waiting for. Everything they do there to try and scare you has already bee done, you aren't shocked by anything you see. You can tell the director was trying to incorporate things from the first film, but his just comes off as a cheap imitation.But hey, don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself and leave a comment below.",Doctor Sleep
791,silven-87129,Cool,8,9 November 2019,"At the box office, the sequel to ""the Shining"" is an adaptation of Stephen king's novel ""Doctor Dream"" from Director Mike Flanagan. Promos of the film did not make it clear until the end what exactly Flanagan continues-a novel by king or a film by Kubrick. The author generously scatters references to both the first and the second, but still the state of the overlook hotel tells us that it is the film that continues.Grown-up Danny Torrence (Ewen McGregor) first follows in the footsteps of his father-becomes an alcoholic, and then ties. After that, he becomes an orderly in a hospice, where with the help of his ""radiance"" he helps people to go to the other world with peace in their souls. Danny meets a young Abra (Kylie Curran), ""shining"" brighter than anyone, who is hunted by a group of ""glow-eating"" vampires.",Doctor Sleep

This is probably more an issue of my own high expectations. Maybe I should have read the book first to know where the mythology was headed. Again, entertaining, if underwhelming. And not at all scary. But still a cool story if you can wrench it (mostly) free from its Shining roots. Horror fans are real sticklers for maintaining the sanctity of THE CLASSICS, so I come to this with a lot of baggage. I felt much the same way about Prometheus, but that's a rant for another day.",Doctor Sleep

795,dreamyguy79,loved every bit of this movie,10,8 November 2019,"This movie feels like a typical Stephen King story, and that is the highest amount of praise that I can give it. Typical as in it is brilliant, genius, awesome. This movie has Great suspense, thrill, feel good moments, and Stephen King's typical story telling prowess. This movie is a journey, it builds up slowly, tying ends and locations from the first book or movie. In order to fully appreciate the references to the original and give you better perspective, I highly recommend reading the first book and/or watching the original movie by Stanley Kubrick(which in my opinion doesn't stick as close to the book), the tv series is much closer to the original story, but you should watch both, and once you watch doctor sleep you'll see why.
This movie is one of the much better Stephen King adaptations, and is very close to the source material. The ride, is amazing. Watch it in Imax. Also. I thought this movie was definitely scarier than IT. Creepier. In 2 hours and 32 minutes of the run time, the director actually took the time to do justice to the book. Highly, Highly recommended to fans of horror, suspense, and just plain good story telling in general!!!!",Doctor Sleep

Well Mike Flanagan, hats off to you, you did it and Ewan produced a superb performance (oscar nominee?) . Just to get the slightly negative bits out out the way, the bits I didn't like and I think many others have said this, are scenes invlolving the new young Danny (thankfully few); though it really highlighted what an amazing performance Danny Lloyd gave in the original film. The bits with Jack in were always going to be difficult for any actor following in the steps of the mighty Jack Nicholson and the same for Wendy, Shelly Duvall was outstanding in the original, anyone portraying either of those charachters were never going to be popular. Back to the film, no spoilers here, the bad guys are beliveable, they genuinly look like the people there portaying and the story gets very dark. Rebecca Ferguson superbly leads the band of bad guys and for the first time ever had me genuinly scared whilst watching a film. Ewan McGregor delivers a great role, I am a big fan of his movies and to me this is his greatest performance since Trainspotting. The movie is 2.5 hours and and apart from maybe a couple of early scenes had me gripped thoughout, my advice to anyone would be to go and see it..though make sure you have seen the Shinning first!",Doctor Sleep

If you're not going to stay true to the book, at least make good decisions for the movie. I'm at a loss for words at how they thought what they did for this movie was good. Then they try way too hard to pay homage to the og Shining (1980) and it just FLOPS. Wtf did I just watch. Not a huge fan of the shining movie, honestly, but hey it is a classic and was cool for the time. I've read both books and neither movie their respective books justice.

Everything I imagined reading the book is transferred to the movie just right, especially Rose. Ending is the thing I was not happy with. I know that this movie supposed to be direct sequel to The Shining movie, and changes were necessary, so the last quarter of this movie goes it's own way, different from the book. From that point the problems start to emerge. In Kubrics movie walking through the Overlook Hotel is chilling, you're just waiting to see (and at the same time you don't wan to see) what's arround that corner, behind that door... In this one, there no suspense, we know what's there. You can't make the same thing again, just to make a raw connection with the first movie, even Kubrick couldn't do it (he wouldn't even try). This movie should stick to the book and it would be just fine. Sometimes even King has problems ending his stories, but this time he did good, so why spoile it? Why, why, why???",Doctor Sleep

If you're a Kubrick fan as I am I can say you'll be satisfied to a certain point with how much homage this movie pays to The Shining, apart from that the movie itself it's something much more different and it stands alone as a worthy sequel to a movie we thought we would never get.",Doctor Sleep
803,mnadias,Good movie but I had to cut the score in half,4,18 April 2020,"Overall The movie was great. If i had to describe it in one sentence it was like scary stories we would tell at night when we were little. Spooky, magical, scary tale. I have to give props for making a horror movie without jump scares, that i could actually watch without getting heart attacks every 5 minutes. Anyway what turned me off in the movie- there was one atrocious scene where I believe the producer went too far: The torture of a little boy. It went on for too long and they made us see too much in my opinion, which could have been avoided sincerely. As a mom, to me that scene was heart-breaking and really made me angry as to what mental illness one who shot it has to have. Too much and could have been made shorter really. Agonizing 5 minutes of torture. A lot of parents I think would agree with me.",Doctor Sleep
804,GalaxyJoe,Welcome to the Shining Multiverse,2,15 February 2020,"Stephen King wasn't a big fan of Kubrick's The Shining. I don't really blame him, Kubrick created his own Torrance universe adjusting a couple essential elements of the book, but this book takes that Torrance Universe and turns it on its head.If you've read the book, don't bother with this film. Mike Flanagan, director and writer, basically threw out the book and destroyed the Torrance universe. While Kubrick changed it up a bit, Flanagan somehow thought he was a better writer than King. He's not. I don't see how anyone who read the book could enjoy this movie. There were over a dozen essential plot points that Flanagan completely ignored or altered and every single one of them was for the worse.As a huge fan of the book, I need to go back to King, reread Doctor Sleep, and try to forget that Flanagan created a multiverse that no fan of the book would want to visit.",Doctor Sleep
805,cmkeller75,Long time fan of The Shining - Was NOT disappointed.,9,29 June 2020,"I am a fan of the original ""The Shining"" so much that we spent our honeymoon at The Stanley Hotel - where Stephen King was inspired to write ""The Shining"".
Only an hour and 45 minutes away from our home, but truly felt like a trip into another time, in another world.
We had a blast, but I digress.
The choice the casting directors did in making Ewan McGregor the adult Danny, was perfect. And if I'm honest, as much of a diehard fan I am of Ewan McGregor, this was not a role that I felt he would ""Shine"" in.
I was super happy to be wrong.
He was PERFECT.
Acting was not either over the top unbelievably dramatic, yet not dull and under-enthused. He played the role absolutely perfectly balanced and realistic - about a man who has spent his entire life trying to dull his shine and the consequences it brings.
Nothing ever truly shocked him to the bone, which would be expected for a man who has dealt with shocking encounters since he was a child ... yet also did not act feelingless towards new encounters.
The little girl (forgive me as I do not know her yet, seeing this as the only movie I've seen her in) was AMAZING. Lovable and empathetic and powerful and determined.
I could absolutely see this turning into more sequels. I'm not a purist - but I do like stories to stay true to the original and this one did.
The AA speech about his father was dead on, to connect perfectly to the timeline of the original, as we can remember that ""Jack"" was ""on the wagon"" when they first entered that damned hotel. Little details like these MATTER when entering into the sequels world.
If they continued to use the same care and attention to detail that they did with Doctor Sleep, they could theoretically create more sequels and spinoff from this point on. Perhaps featuring new characters and even continuing on where the young girl left off.
I really enjoyed this movie. And 2 and a half hours went by super quickly, because it was never dull. And constantly moving at a steady pace, never turning into a dull moment - for even a minute.
Well done! I'm very very pleased with this movie that I honestly was very skeptical of, when I first learned it was released.",Doctor Sleep

First it spends the first part getting to know the villains, understanding their motives. Yes they need to survive by doing some unspeakable acts. At one point i was squirming in my chair.The relationship between ""uncle""dan and Abra was a great one, i loved he was a scared of his powers and wanted nothing to do with them, where Abra wasnt a namby pamby 13 year old, she was strong and confident. Instead of her running away screaming, she stood and fought,Also some of the visuals blew me away.I watch alot of films and this i would have to say is one of the best films ive ever seen.

To even place this in the same league of Stanley Kubrik is just very incorrect. This is a different movie entirely.

I avoided going to see Dr sleep, when I saw the trailer as it made it look like a cheap homage to the Shining. I thought seeing his aesthetic and ideas being reused might ruin it a bit. However, i got curious today and watched it. My first impression is it's a very good movie. It stands on its own exploring new territory while evoking some the themes from the original. The director manages to bring his own take on king's novel while using kubrick's work as a visual platform. Yes in some areas it moves into a nostalgia but its all done in a way that explores a different vision.

822,Kyle_Eason,Worthwhile Effort Falls Short of Greatness,6,17 November 2019,"Flanagan's film needed to be made, and Shining fans will applaud the effort. We really wanted this one to blow us away. At many times in the film, however, I felt the project would have benefited from having a strong and independent story and script editor cut out the too frequent fluff and veering off into language and timing best left in King's book. Too many of the characters were simple devices and lacked depth. In fact, the film, as a whole, too often seemed flat.Rebecca Ferguson's ""Rose The Hat"" character seemed to, again, lack depth and often appears to be a fanboy's forbidden crush complete with dangerous curves, a magic hat and colorful braids rather than a nearly immortal, child-killing, soul-sucking banshee. Her minions seem oddly cliche. Kyleigh Curran held her own, but seemed a bit out of her depth - not surprising for a child - but this is what director's and coaches are for. Ewan McGregor was fine - but not particularly compelling, and who could expect him to carry the whole picture?It's difficult - nearly impossible one could say - to create a successful sequel when significant portions of the sequel recast the original roles and try to recreate original scenes. My advice would have been - for the sake of a moving picture show - to avoid those visual mine fields altogether no matter now much Stephen King asked for it. Pick up the story with adolescent, then adult Danny and let mother, father and the original film be classic misty memories that stand alone. Build on them as they lay.Overall, good effort that had potential, but you should have re-edited and ""killed your darlings"" before the final cut.",Doctor Sleep

Lets start with the amazing director Mike Flanagan, who, in my opinion, may have pulled of a task that many - including me thought was impossible. Make a worthy sequel to the shining.The casting is seriously great, i loved Ewan Mcgregor as Dan.Lets get to the bits where i did think it falls short though. It would have needed to be a tiny bit longer. The ending felt like it became a bit rushed, mostly with the climax with the villain. Also, instead of recreating scenes from the shining, why not use the real deal? I didnt see a bigger reason for any of the scenes that DIDNT feature a recreation of the shining for them to be in there at all. I think that could have been done differently, but i understand that the filmmakers wanted to flourish some nostalgia. Otherwise then that - Mike Flanagan, you goddamn genius.

My girlfriend and I went to a test screening for this late 2019 and by now I have watched at least 5 or 6 times. This movie is beyond great to me and that is a serious understatement. If you are a fan of The Shining let me tell you that you are MISSING OUT if you pass on this movie. I advise you to at least look up the original story however because it is based more off of the book. Even if you are unfamiliar with the Shining though I promise this movie will still deliver simply due to the fact that it does many different genres well all at once. A true masterpiece.,Doctor Sleep
851,haydentheroadhogmain,An exeptional follow-up to a cult classic,9,1 April 2020,"Doctor Sleep is the next chapter in the horrifying The Shining universe, based on the novel by Stephen King. It tells the story of Danny Torrence many years later, he is now an alcoholic and is still traumatized by the past events, he doesn't use his shining anymore, and he's trying to recover from being an alcoholic, 8 years later he succeds and meets a young Abra who has interfered with the work of an evil cult, that kills kids with the shining ability in order to try and make themselves immortal, he must now help keep her safe against the cult. Now before I get started, I have watched the director's cut of the film, and the difference between it is that it's 3 hours and 17 seconds, while the threatrical cut is only 2 hours and 32 minutes. I think this might be the better version as the threatrical cut has cut some parts, and it may have missed a couple of details here and there, but the director's cut is this full on everything version, then again I have not seen the threatrical cut, so there's that, but honestly I don't think it matters which version you have seen that much. As they both convey the movie for what it is. Doctor sleep is a amazing horror fiction movie that has great character development, tons of nostalgia from the original The shining, a lot of character development, a solid lead, and a very interesting premise. It tries to be it's own film for as much as possible, as sometimes Danny Torrence is sidelined for the Abra story arc, but that doesn't hold it back one bit, this movie is well rounded and is an awesome sequal to the original beloved cult classic.PROS:
-The story is very interesting and is executed very well
-Amazing cinematography
-Has a very dark atmosphere, and for the first hour of it's runtime it was pretty disturbing for me, the second and third hour was more of the fiction coming through
-The cast performed well and delivered some good performances
-Has plenty of nostalgia and fanservice from The Shining
-Is very entertaining got me hooked from start to finish
-Is able to blend in the genres it has pretty well, despite them being pretty easy since, these genres are kinda related
-This movie is different and tries to make itself its own movie as much as it can, this isn't a haunted house movie, it isn't about the overlook hotel, it isn't a prequel, it's something new and brilliant
-Rose the hat is a pretty good main antagonistCONS:
-The overlook hotel could have been portrayed much better than it did
-Some arcs are overaching the main arcs
-The runtime for the director's cut is too long, and some scenes do linger on for a while, now some of these scenes could have been taken out, like the random interactions between the cult, but those scenes are genuinely fine for me, this is in the cons section because some people may be bugged out because of the runtime of this movieOverall Doctor Sleep is a really good well rounded horror fiction film, that has a very interesting premise, great execution, great chapter arcs, amazing performance from the cast, and a standout villain in Rose the hat. This movie was really enjoyable and got me hooked from beginning to the end. I have to give Doctor Sleep a 9/10 a damn near perfect movie, that's geniuely scary and full of tension, yet has a taste of different genres here and there while being able to juggle them all really well throughout it's runtime.",Doctor Sleep

The girl playing Abra (Kyliegh Curran) is AMAZING and does a wonderful job creating her character, oftentimes out-Shining (pun intended) A-Lister Ewan McGregor.

Dan Torrance did not come out of The Overlook Hotel unscathed. Which would seem odd if a person only watched the Kubrick's mess. Which seems to be what all the reviewers praising Kubrick's version. did. This film has plot development, a story arc. a lead character that can be sympathized with, an ending rather than the film just stopping. Kubrick could have made his own movie about a Haunted Hotel as his Shining did not share anything with the Novel except a few excerpts. But he wanted to steal the title for box office recognition. You will come away satisfied after watching Doctor Sleep. If you want to watch a screen version of the Shining the TV movie was a far superior adaption.

868,romkevdv17,A very competent sequel to book and movie until the third act,6,9 November 2019,"Sticking mostly to the Stephen King book of the same name, focusing on the True Knot cult and Rose the Hat was a decision that payed off well for director Mike Flanigan, providing the movie's best scenes and a coherent well-paced plot. This holds up and delights its viewers, with eccentric performances from Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson, Dan Torrance and Rose the Hat respectively, until the third act rolls around. This deviates from the book heavily, which decided for a more lengthy battle that ultimately defeats the True Knot gang/cult. In the movie it results in a shootout sequence poorly placed in a movie that has up to that point only shown horiffic gore or battles of the mind. This shooutout seems better fit in modern action blockbusters like Fast and Furious or an Ang Lee film. This kills 90% of the cult, leaving only Crow Daddy and Rose The Hat, with the crow being killed in a car crash a few minutes later.This leaves a lot of questions for the ending of the movie, how are you going to have a satisfactory ending the like of Shining (1980) or at least one that doesn't end with a single gunshot or axe swing. The movie doesn't seem to know that either, dragging out the third act for far too long than is necessary. As expected, we are brought back to the Overlook Hotel and it plays up tropes far too cringeworthy when compared to the way the movie has played out beforehand. It is almost entirely predictable and much of the inherently scary aspects of the hotel or the original film are played up to such an extent that it becomes hilariously ridiculous. This is done in a mostly accurate recreation of the original set, now aged and decrepid but not any more scary.They also attempt at recreating scenes from the original movie but avoiding using original footage, instead actors that look or sound only slightly like the iconic actors who portrayed them. Only Wendy and Dick Hallorann are done well for the most part, with Wendy's accent recreated perfectly and Dick Hallorann's look done justice. The actor portraying Jack is goofy, but not in the fun way, even when trying to be serious. Their failure at recreating scenes was clear when the audience laughed out loud in a recreation of the scene of Wendy defending herself in the bathroom and when Jack pretends to be Lloyd, which until this fact was revealed I really thought he WAS Lloyd. This is even more frustrating when Ready Player One, a year before, blended original footage and cgi to give us a chilling and fun sequence. And when the credits roll, you find yourself let down, because the last few minutes were all too predictable and boring and contrasting to the tension built up for the majority of the movie.Mike Flanagan wanted to honour fans of both The Shining book and movie, but ended up dissapointing both of them.",Doctor Sleep

Now, there's a lot of good things you can explore here and maybe if this film was in better hands, that would've been the case.

875,vitnamee,I liked it,7,29 March 2020,"I've seen ""The Shining"". Never read the books. I enjoyed it. It is a supernatural film with a splash of horror elements. It gives some heebee jeebies but its not a horror film like the first movie or in another vein ""nightmare on elm street"". There is a disturbing scenes with a child having his spirits consumed but that turned up my antagonism towards the antagonists even more.Casting seemed cool to me. I liked Ewan Mcgregor (but he always be Obi-Wan to me). The actress who plays the Rose the Hat is awesome and charming even though she is clearly the evil one. Reminds me of Captain Barbossa in Pirates of Carribean. Clearly the bad guy but hard to hate the character. The kid was cool too. Dick Halloran looks like he aged only a day.Since it's an adaptation of a book, I think character development was changed/cut short that may be a detriment. I looked up the books synopsis because the movie engaging enough for me to check it out. It's not the same as reading the book but I understand some significant changes that was made for time purposes. The last half of the last act, I did not like. I think I would of liked the ending from the book (again didn't read it but seen the synopsis so just a thought).Seems like some other reviewers are angry about the Overlook return, but my understanding is that it was there in the book as well. Some easter eggs (that's what im calling it) were great but it felt like it goes overboard. In a related point, the ghost of Jack does come back but for different reasons (book to movie). I think the movie traded for nostalgia than a satisfying ending. Character development may have suffered for this last part.",Doctor Sleep
876,adamnixonsmiley,Kubrick was better than King's novel. Flanagan was not.,6,18 January 2020,"There's Kubrick's 'The Shining' and King's 'The Shining.' That Kubrick outshone, by some degree, King's novel incensed King so much to the point a remake of 'the Shining' was done in 1997. Kubrick's version is completely different and much better. He achieved a level of artistic creation that King could and can never reach(yet gets credit for.) They should be treated as totally unconnected. Therein lay the problem for Flanagan. The film uses Kubrick's version as canon which is fine, but King's novel Doctor Sleep, could have been much more closely followed without violating Kubrick's version. McGregor is horribly miscast. He's not Danny Torrance. There is little to no character development with regards The True Knot. Snakebite Andi for instance is not the one dimensional man-hating character she appears in the film. Crow Daddy is completely different. And while Ferguson gives an adequate performance of Rose the Hat, the novel's Rose is far more menacing with a much different personality and relationship to her clan. The Stone family is where there is an infuriating disregard for the novel. Abra's mother and grandmother are far more formidable and involved. Her father and the Doctor who goes to the AA meetings, in King's novel, are real heroes. This is completely ignored by Flanagan. The use of the Overlook makes sense in the novel. It is tacked on in the film. It's one of the best bits in King's novel while it makes not sense in the film. There is no logical reasoning to this in the film, while the novel's connection to the original is crystal clear. Again, Flanagan did not need to violate Kubrick's masterpiece to align the film and the novel. For once, sticking to King's novel would have made this better.

880,liberalareblowhacks,"""The Shining"" has no sequel",4,11 November 2019,"I tried to be fair going into this, which I felt I was. Honestly though, while watching the original movie from 1980 just a couple weeks ago it dawned on me that any sequel that tries to touch this sacred material is doomed to fail. I don't think the movie ever had much of a chance in terms of plot. I didn't care for the book, which I had read several years ago. A group of traveling steam vampires seemed a bit juvenile, especially when you compare it to the quality of unspecified horror in Kubrick's movie. The two don't compare because they're not even in the same league. The Shining was one of those stories that I never felt could be done justice in terms of a sequel and that's exactly what transpired onscreen before my very eyes.The movie had a rather slow start in my opinion, picking up a little energy as we're reintroduced to a now-adult Dan Torrance who, not surprisingly, developed an alcohol problem of his own. Yes I know, research proves that alcoholism runs in families, but it seems a bit uneventful and even forced in this case that this is what ultimately becomes of the little boy on the tricycle that we all remember from Kubrick's movie. Isn't this the 400th time that one of King's characters has some type of addiction problem? The shining power that Dan possesses, along with the messages scrawled on the wall day after day, would leave anyone in confusion who hasn't read the book or watched the original film. The actor playing Dan has some relatable onscreen chemistry with the child actress who has the same power, but the two of them meeting up like they did and traveling physically and cognitively from place to place and situation to situation to battle the villains is a little tough to swallow. I will give the movie a speck of credit for wandering off into very risky territory with the inclusion of a pretty disturbing scene involving a child. It was the first time I'd ever heard people in a theater express actual verbal disgust at what they were watching. So there was definitely some impact, to what degree good or bad is your own perception.So the movie him-haws along, as Dan loses his homeless beard and begins to communicate more and more with the little girl. Some scenes do carry a bit of suspense, no doubt. The problem I had with them was that much of it was overshadowed by some confusion on what was actually happening and what was occurring in someone's mind as a result of the shining power. Then we get a scene where the villains are ambushed out in the woods by Dan, his AA buddy and the little girl. Dan, who up until this point came off as more of a solemn and reflective type of individual, now goes full-on Rambo and starts picking off the villains from the trees, maybe not even entirely convinced of who he's actually shooting at. This happens, that happens, blah, blah, blah, until we arrive at the movie's finale in the Overlook Hotel, which is what I would guess attracted about 98% of the viewers. I admit that at first I was having chills going through that place again. The corridors looked convincing and the sets themselves were very nicely recreated. What axed (no pun intended) it for me was the inclusion of several classic scenes from Kubrick's movie that were reshot with new actors and actresses. Have you ever heard that old expression about some things having more impact when they're not shown? That would've applied perfectly here, as we're forced to relive those moments in our minds as Dan walks through hallway after hallway. A scene that I found quite laughable (not to the movie's credit) occurs at the bar in the Gold Room, where Jack and Lloyd chatted many years ago over straight-up bourbon. Instead of letting the viewers delve into their imaginations to feel Jack's menace and influence they decide to give us Henry Thomas (yup, the ET kid) as a replacement for Jack Nicholson. He refers to himself as ""Lloyd"" in the movie, but we all know who it's supposed to be. This scene and one a little bit later with all of the Overlook ghosts (new actors and actresses, mind you) swarming the villain on the ground for her steam had me putting my face into my palm. How can any sensible director think this would be effective, as opposed to just plain goofy? Kubrick's ghosts all had a quiet menace to them, with much of what they were conveying coming not from what they said but how they moved and their body language in general. Think of the 1980 version of Lloyd or Delbert Grady in particular. Grady's eyes and expressions changed slowly as he talked with Jack in the bathroom, gradually presenting to us a demon of a man who had committed unspeakable acts against his family. His terror didn't come from a flat-out, in-your-face approach to scare you. It was a combination of his slow, yet calculated style of interaction. Here we get the dollar store version of Grady who is haplessly scrambling for his spot on the floor in his desperate quest for...steam? No thank you.Fans who love and appreciate Kubrick's film from 1980 will want to see this, if for nothing else, just to see what the Overlook now looks like. It must've been a humbling day for King to have to agree with the director and use Kubrick's visuals instead of his own lost and uninspired version of The Shining, which was a made-for-TV production back in 1997 I believe. On a quick side note, I recommend giving that a shot on a quiet Sunday. You'll definitely be laughing at it and not with it. As for this Doctor Sleep movie, it turned out to be very, very average. I've always said that a movie's quality is assessed by how long it stays with you afterward. I'm still reanalyzing portions of Kubrick's movie in my head after having watched it for the 80th time a couple weeks ago. This movie leaves no such thing to be desired. Everything is spoon-fed to you from beginning to end. The high marks for me were hearing the ballroom music from the original being used in various scenes. It was wonderful to hear again, but it was also a sad reminder of the reality that it's not 1980 anymore and films will never have the same quality again. Doctor Sleep is just another Hollywood drone like so many these days. Film schools still use Kubrick's movie for curriculum. Trust me, in three months everyone will have completely forgotten about this one, if they haven't already.",Doctor Sleep
881,vladalexa-57122,Good sequel,8,6 November 2019,"I didn't expect it to be good at all after the disappointing IT 2, but the movie was actually really good. Still it's not nowhere near Shining so don't expect a masterpiece.
The biggest disappointment was Jack Nicholson himself, because it's not actually him, the new actor or cgi or whatever they used doesn't look like Nicholson at all, it's horrible. Next time maybe they should ask for help to that guy on YouTube who does deepfakes all by himself and are 100 times better.
I recommend this to everyone, but I feel it's necessary to watch Shining before (something everyone should do in any case).",Doctor Sleep

I almost turned it off a couple of times but I love Rebecca Ferguson and was curious to see how it would end. The very worst part of the movie is when the monsters kidnap a boy and torture him to death. I had to fast forward it because the boys screams were so unnerving. It was an extreamly upsetting scene. Other movies skip over the part where a kid is being tortured and/or murdered; this movie zoomed in on it. The movie has great actors in it. It is creative but also pays homage to Steven Kings book. Over all, I shouldn't have watched it.",Doctor Sleep

It captured the audience from the very beginning with its suspension and managed to build it up until the very end. Doctor Sleep felt like a ridiculous B-level horror film next to it.What strikes me is how on earth has this film earned such a good score? The story was oddly kinky, the visual effects were hilarious and the acting was mediocre at best. How they managed to recruit Ewan McGregor for this I will never understand.I will, however, give props to the reincarnation of the scenes from the original Shining.

The fact that when I wrote this comment the movie was rated 7,3/10 stars is an even bigger mistery.Everything is wrong : the plot, the dialogs, the horrible color grading, it does not even look like a real cinema movie (just a cheap telemovie). I spent half the movie face-palming myself.To sum it up without spoiling it, the movie could be best described as a fantastic teenage telemovie, with a team of good guys trying to destroy a team of bad guys.

Before that act the movie was just really long and nothing really happened. The acting from Rebecca Furguson and Ewan McGregor was ofc good, but imo Kyliegh Curran overdid the acting so much and it was just sooo bad.Overall the movie was just boring and I wanted it to end after less than an hour.",Doctor Sleep
900,brandonjeffreyarmstrong,They didn't (spoiler) and I love it!,9,31 October 2019,"Lately in film, one of the biggest things we see get neglected is characters that we can care about. That is not a problem at all in Doctor Sleep. The three lead actors all do fantastic jobs with a terrific script and story, making us care about who they are, and why they're doing what they're doing. It was a thrill to see what is sure to be a star-making performance from Kyleigh Curran. Rebecca Ferguson chews the scenery in every one of her scenes, and it doesn't feel out of place or distracting here. There is an action scene that seemed kind of sudden and unjustified, but out of the entire movie, one out-of-place scene did not ruin it at all.
Now, this should be far enough down that if you're reading it, you've actually made the effort to find the spoilers that I have. Here they are. First, I'm over the moon happy that they chose not to digitally recreate the faces of the four main actors from The Shining, opting instead to use lookalike actors, all of whom did a fantastic job in supporting roles as the classic characters from almost 40 years ago. This makes Danny's conversation with Lloyd/Jack one that still draws you in, one that is not encumbered by distracting CGI work.
The other spoiler-filled praise I have for this movie is the character of the Overlook Hotel, because let's face it, that was one of the most interesting characters in the first movie. This one spends 2 hours being its own compelling supernatural thriller before we even see a hint of the Overlook returning, so it doesn't rely on fan service to keep you engaged or interested, but instead uses fan service as a reward at the end of an already-excellent film.",Doctor Sleep

907,carolbrewer,Not Even the Title Makes Sense,1,10 August 2020,"My son, knowing of my hatred for all remakes and decades-later ""sequels"", pushed me into watching this with him. I will not soon forget that either. But I don't know what's more the travesty...this film, or some of the reviews about it. Anyone suggesting this thing is on par with Kubrick's adaptation of the Shining is way, way off.First off, child torture or murder is not edgy. It's a turn off. I know it's not a Stephen King novel unless some kid gets killed, but very few directors can pull it off on film. Frank Darabont is one of them. This guy isn't. After 2 child murders, our roving caravan of soul-suckers still couldn't get me to care about seeing them get their just desserts. That's bad. Really bad. Darabont had me wanting to see brutal retribution over a MOUSE. So that's my first argument to anyone suggesting that this is some kind of masterpiece on par with Kubrick (or anyone else for that matter). If the characters were so thin that killing little children (in ways that would make you puke at the theater), didn't leave you wanting to see bloody retribution, then this movie stunk.I almost have to congratulate the director for being so self-aware about this project that, while these soul-suckers had apparently been wreaking havoc for centuries, they were all taken out by ONE SHOT with a box store hunting rifle. Apparently even he knew that none of his characters had garnered enough heat for anyone to care how they died.Everything we knew about the ""shine"" was also turned on its head. While it was portrayed as ESP in the Shining, something widely discussed during the '70s, it has now become a super power worthy of Xmen status in this film. Complete with tons of CGI. And I love the boxes Danny was able to put (and apparently keep) the Overlook entities in. Couldn't Hallorann have done that before the first movie ever happened? I mean, he IS the guy who told Danny to do it, so it's not like he didn't know it could be done. So, you either can't keep the entities in a box, or Hallorann just left them wandering around for poor Danny (and others) to have to deal with. He'd be responsible for the deaths of Jack and the Grady family. That's how little sense ALL of this makes! None.I also loved how King complained about ""character development"" in Kubrick's adaptation of the Shining. That's rich given how precious little there was for anyone in this film. I've already discussed how the most heinous of acts created little to no real animosity towards the film's antagonists, but Abra's parents could have been replaced with cardboard cutouts. Her father, who is viciously murdered, is gotten over immediately by his young daughter. Then, when she tells her mother she still talks to him, her mother basically says, ""that's nice, dear"" and leaves! Would you not want to know what your dead spouse talked about? Would you not have a message for him? Or if you don't believe a word of it, are you not on the phone with the kid's pediatrician? Just horrible. Just atrocious. That's the direction and script that poor actress was given.Last, and least, is the Overlook...because every character (even the house) has to be completely neutered by the time this film ends. Even Jack, for that matter, who ""was ALWAYS the caretaker"", is now the friggen bartender. Why? Lloyd was the bartender, and he's just as dead now as he ever was, so why isn't he the bartender? But no, the guy who was ""always the caretaker"" has to be the Shining trope bartender, because that makes so much sense. But if we're going to have a Jack/Danny moment, then let's get some resolution out of it. Nope. While every other ghost remembered who the hell they were, Jack's got no idea who he is. Grady knew. He knew about his wife and kids, and his ""correction"" of them, but once again this director acts like he's never seen the original film other than the iconic visuals he grabbed from it.And finally the main antagonist is killed by the house entities that Danny was able to lock in boxes, that Dick Hallorann never bothered to. And then the house bursts into flames. Don't ask me how. I know Danny was in the boiler room. He also managed to turn all the lights on, which was pretty special after the Overlook had been abandoned decades earlier. Did anyone see him grab some gas for those generators? I sure didn't, and gas doesn't last in generators for decades, so.... And does anyone think that outdoor maze would keep its shape after the Overlook was abandoned? Maybe Lloyd was out cutting the grass and trimming those hedges? I've seen cheap straight to DVD movies with more logic.This was a long one, but the unbelievably positive reviews deserved a proper rebuttal. The film made the fatal error of constantly reminding the audience of a BETTER movie. It made the other critical error of depicting heinous acts by characters so thin, that the audience was mad at the film makers instead of the antagonists! That's how detached we were. And lastly it made no sense and had no logic. Soul/Shine suckers depicted as terrified of dying, meet long dead soul/shine suckers who exist ""forever and ever and ever"". What?This was a completely different story, shoehorned (badly) into the Shining to cash in on a successful book & film from decades ago. And it's too bad. The Shining is an awesome ghost story. Its references to the Donner Party are perfect, and that true story is unsettling enough to convince any viewer of the evil that could lurk in those mountains, and in that hotel. Dozens died, (36 of them, children) and some were sacrificed for the purpose of eating their flesh. And all because 2 con men talked them into taking that route, and then hid all the letters of warning sent from other parties NOT to take that shortcut. It was a betrayal beyond all betrayals, and they should salt the earth where it happened. That's truly terrifying, and just the mere mention of it was and is more than enough to get me invested in the timeless story that is, the Shining. With a LOT of work, Doctor Sleep might succeed as a standalone, but it has no place in the Shining lore.",Doctor Sleep

Though The one scene involving baseball boy is disturbing in nature In my opinion.In Particular, The stand ins for the characters from The Shining, excluding maybe Shelley Duvall, were not enough for me. Though the film was so engaging that it covered the cost.And what I fully enjoyed with no hesitation:Favorite visual part was when Rose The Hat Astral Projects to find Abra. The way they showed her floating split screen between the Starry Sky and Lit Earth was awesome.The Way McGregor play Danny felt right for the story. It was subtle and let the elements of film take a hold as they should.Everyone is mentioning Rebecca Ferguson's performance as Rose The Hat, and she is great, but, I actually felt the sinister performance of the film came from Emily Alyn Lind. Every time she turned on the evil, I was scared about what would happen.Finally, at the end when Danny says goodbye and tells Abra to Shine on, that was a good ending to me. Felt like closure to the events. And thinking about how everyone says what type of film this was, being more of a thriller with horror elements, I think closure is the right thing.

The original Shining is a classic and cannot be compared. However, this film stands on it's own. It had the perfect balance of horror and fantasy and great acting, soundtrack, camera work and the writing was imaginative. There were plenty of homage scenes but it did not feel like a sequel. A must see for the fans of the original film and anyone who likes fantasy/horror. I love the lead actress, Kylie Curran and Ewan McGregor was fantastic as always. Loved this film.",Doctor Sleep

930,benjaminlupton,"Potential was there, but bellyflopped",3,23 February 2021,"I feel Ewan tried his best, and was let down by the director not connecting the emotion he displayed to the viewer. The friend was a great actor. The tortured boy was fantastic in that scene. Everything else just felt rushed and mediocre. Nothing registered, everything was monotone, the girl jogs from room to room while she is being chased by an axe; which is the metaphor for this movie. It jogs along to another and another room of licking vampires, sucking any ability to feel anything for the movie, as they just move from scene to scene without emotion, doing only what seems the first take every time. It seemed it had potential, but the director made some poor casting decisions and never brought any life out of the characters except the tortured boy. Just seems it is made for early teenagers who haven't experienced enough realness in life to recognise it. However, then again, apparently this is a netflix movie, and nothing on there seems real at all. Bring back movies where the characters were real. Don't just bring them back from the dead as zombies for our enjoyment as this movie did. Martyrs did a way better job, they should have got that director for this movie, that would have connected some real trauma to this story.",Doctor Sleep
931,dlmslp1,Almost great,7,25 November 2019,"Since I love Kubrick's version of The Shining, I was excited and apprehensive for this sequel. As I watched I was surprised by how much I liked it. I was good with the characters and casting. Particularly Rose the Hat who was excellent. This part of the movie was very solid. I was fine with the early references to the Kubrick version until it became too much. The ghosts and the presence of the Overlook were absolutely terrifying in The Shining and here they fell short for me. Just not scary out of context when forced into Danny and Abra's new world. Even Rose the Hat gives it all a smirk. To me it felt unnecessary to incorporate so much of The Shining. The more you see of something, the less scary it becomes. Less is more and that would've held true here for me. Further, I never viewed the Overlook ghosts/hotel as feeding off the shine/steam but more of just a classic haunting of the place itself collecting new souls.As much as I love The Shining, I would've preferred less of it in Doctor Sleep because it had a solid story to tell on its own.",Doctor Sleep
932,whatutalkinaboot,Fundamentally flawed.,5,13 November 2019,"I went into this movie with high hopes. Being a big Shining fan and lifelong Stephen King reader, this was something that I had eagerly anticipated for some time. Unfortunately, the film was largely disappointing. It's not that this is a bad movie - it isn't - but neither can it be considered a highly rated one. Frustratingly, it languished somewhere in between, with some very good parts to it, but as a whole the film is let down by some poor casting, editing and clunky direction. Such flaws, unfortunately, impact the flow of the plot and keep pulling the viewer back from becoming totally absorbed by the story.The film's pacing is uneven, particularly in the opening half of the movie. There is no sense of dread or atmosphere for large sections and thereafter, the rest of the movie clearly struggles to raise the tension level sufficiently. In truth, it never really recovers.The casting/direction of Rose is fatal to entire movie. How can one forgive the plot's primary foil being so lacking in any sort of sinister threat? The part is poorly casted, acted and directed. The rest of her gang were also, for the most part, afflicted with a similar lack of effectiveness. They're just not scary. It's a huge problem.The baseball boy scene didn't fit with the overall story. It felt unnecessarily gratuitous - its effect was to introduce a level of grim violence that was fatally lacking in the necessary scariness/fright that one might hope for and expect. It felt more like something from Breaking Bad than Stephen King - again, the scene was infected with a lack of fright.Finally, the use of lookalikes for the original Shining characters doesn't work at all. The use of a Jack Nicholson doppleganger, in particular, was something that yanked the whole movie theatre from its engagement with the story. The scene at the bar was a poorly performed and utterly misguided addition to the script. They should have considered using nicholson himself for that part, even though that may have presented its own problems. At least the acting would have been better.To be fair, it wasn't all bad. McGregor and Curran are excellent. The nods to the original movie/book are well handled. However, the positives do not come close to offsetting the negatives and ultimately the general sense in the movie theatre was one of disappointment. A decent handful of people actually walked out at various stages. Never a great sign but in truth one could hardly blame them. The flaws are so apparent early on in the film, that one quickly realises that they won't be overcome.Disappointingly average.",Doctor Sleep

The references to the shining felt forced in a lot of places, and didn't particularly add much to the story. It felt like this was shoehorned into a rather disturbing story about children being abducted. And I really do wonder about the choice to include that scene with the child being tortured and murdered. It was completely unnecessary to show to that extent and it disturbed me that somebody decided to include it to this extent. Child abduction and torture is not ""entertainment"" to me.",Doctor Sleep

When the movie moves forward without relying on the previous movie ""it shines"", it is when it tries to emulate what Kubrick did when the panorama is clouded. It is appreciated to see the inventiveness of Flanagan in the different sequences of ""astral travel"", and especially in the way he guided Mc Gregor and Ferguson who perform very convincing performances.In general it is very enjoyable, although I think it was left over half an hour.My favorite part: The baseball boy.",Doctor Sleep

The subdued and ambivalent nature of the original storytelling is enticing and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was truly a movie that's worth studying.Doctor Sleep, however, cannot find a place for itself. As a Shining sequel, it has literal vampire people with ridiculous hats sucking vapors and took all the ambiguity & suspense out. As a standalone movie, it cheapens itself by frequently (esp. in the second half) re-creating scenes from the Shining & nostalgia-bating.Doctor Sleep, no matter how it markets itself, is NOT a sequel to the Shining (if I knew that before going in I would probably like the movie better). It is a supernatural fantasy movie targeting age 5-15, like Stephen King's book originally intended. That made it a faithful adaptation, but not great cinema.Even though the movie is thematically atrocious, I can say that it is still well-made. I can see someone who was not a huge fan of the Shining actually enjoy this - which is probably most of the 5-15 year-old demographic. Yet for me, it is a complete abandonment of Kubrick's vision, adds no new cinematic or artistic value, disrespects legacy for commercial value, and a huge let down.",Doctor Sleep

This film uses osmosis to get into you. It has many themes to engage your mind but will also creep over your skin. When it isn't being disturbing or philosophical it's honouring a cinematic classic in a fascinating way.Sometimes I was distracted by the balancing act the director was performing to please the King/Kubrick teams but he's done it well. The Shining film doesn't need a sequel of course though maybe King's book does. To use the Kubrick film to help the King story could have been a completely disrespectful disaster but it isn't. The film ultimately has its own identity & a week later it's still brewing inside me.This is a good film.,Doctor Sleep

956,Motion-Picture_Maven,Doctor Sleep Shines!,8,10 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep debuts with a modern flair, abounding with a fresh and unique story-line, compliments of our world-renowned, celebrated Stephen King.I believe that King cultivated this film's title of Doctor Sleep, partially from the nickname that young Danny Torrance was given from his parents who often referred to their son as ""Doc,"" was an intelligent and astute linkage to its' original film, The Shining.Ewan McGregor's character portrayal of the adult Danny Torrance was committed and rigorous, seemingly deriving his newest nickname of ""Doctor Sleep"" through his employment at a hospital for the affirmed, where Danny was compelled to use his ""shine gift"" shockingly, unofficially and spontaneously assisting with the peaceful transition of the sick.To me, the amazement of the picture was its in-depth focus of the range, capability and usage of the gift by its recipients. Stephen King methodically reveled in the exhibition of the array of ways the gift manifested itself for good and for evilness throughout the story.It appears that King has taken on-the-mantle and decided to end this 40 year hiatus of this epic, by continuing the story with the creation of a much younger cast including newcomer, dynamo actress Kyliegh Curran whose character portrayal of Abra Stone emerges with quite the energy and vitality.Rose the Hat played by the illustrious Rebecca Ferguson was highly imaginative, inventive and powerful. I believe this is her most exceptional role to date.Great replacement characters for Wendy Torrance played by Alex Essoe, was beyond acceptable.A pleasant appreciation would have been for Doctor Sleep to have contained more original footage, characterizations and general connection to The Shining, as The Shining was truly an enigmatic and inexplicably distressing film that stays with you.",Doctor Sleep

The characters make very little sense & appear to simply be invented conveniently to support a half story.

It is not good, instead, to make a film as a sequel to a masterpiece, because the comparison is inevitable and it already starts badly. And indeed, it gets worse. If it wasn't for the sound of the popcorn muncher sitting at a couple of rows from me, I would have fallen asleep several times. Ah yes, some jump scares have helped me stay awake too, especially for the good quality and the very high volume of the speakers in the theatre. Most of the acting, including Ewan McGregor, who does not revive the lackluster character, is certainly not very bright. Rebecca Ferguson is good and animates a credible and powerful Rose the Hat; Mike Flanagan's direction is undoubtedly very good.",Doctor Sleep
959,Richie-JG,Dr Z,4,24 November 2019,"I must be living in a parallel universe here. The bulk of the reviews are describing an original and creative masterpiece whereas I witnessed a generic teen/superhero fantasy film with no tangible narrative.The tenuous links to The Shining were cringeworthy, as were the look-a-likies in the form of Dick Hallaran, young Danny and Jack Torrance. The 'cult' characters, lead by the woman in the hat, could've been written in to any old horror/fantasy film script, and Ewan McGregor's mock American alcoholic wasn't very convincing, especially when he looked 8 years younger, 8 years later, after a shave and hair trim.The crescendo, predictably set in the Overlook Hotel, ended up in a farce of 'who's who' from the original Shining, resulting in a group ghoul wrestle on the 'baseball bat' stairs.No notable performances throughout, far too long and if this is rated as a credible 'sequel' to the Shining, then we're all in trouble.

960,totorototoro,"So, So. A bit rused a time. No real horror vibe.",6,2 September 2020,"The movie is decent. However, since I have read the book, It felt like the movie in the beginning just checked all the major boxes that were in the book in order for the story to rush forward. I have a hard time to belive that people not having the book feel much for the characters at the beginning. Some ""scary"" stuff placed here and there but they are not really scary. Not horrible by all means though.The pushers were portrayed badly. Women (and some of the men) were supposed to be cool, and they talked in a whisperish seductive voices that made me think they would fit very well in a twilight movie as some sexy vampire or something like that. I was hoping for a bit menacing feeling, but when they also added some soft music to their scene it felt very off....The ending was ok, they took their time with some of those scenes which was nice.Decent movie if you have nothing else to watch. But it could have been pretty damn good if several aspects were improved a bit. The Knot gang did not work for me at all, and i would have prefered they have taken their time on some of the scenes and maybe cut some out. Maybe better music score (apart from the ones that were actually reused ofc :)",Doctor Sleep
961,reggieltd,My First Review - Excellent Film!!,8,4 May 2020,"Before I sat down to watch this film the question I kept asking myself was 'how will this film compare to The Shining?' I watched The Shining in my teens and it scared me to my core and was one of the most psychologically disturbing films I had seen and still is today. The Shining is a masterpiece and to make a sequel to it was always going to be a very daunting task............but a task well completed.First the run time of both films are at the 2 and a half hour mark, The Shining managed to make this quite long run time go by at a nice steady past, as does Doctor Sleep. At no point watching this film did I think scenes were overrun, that the pace was beginning to drop, in fact the polar opposite. Every scene had its purpose which is in great credit to the director Mike Flanagan.Along with great pacing and direction one of the key elements that make this film so watchable is the cast. Ewan McGregor is cast as a now grown up Dan Torrance and strikes the perfect balance of a traumatised Dan who then turns his life around. Rebecca Ferguson is superb as Rose The Hat and is an example of casting at its most finest. Her beauty is as incredible as her savagery in once scene in particular. The stand out performance however must go to the young and brilliant Kyliegh Curran who plays Abra Stone, for such a young actress she shows years beyond her youth and in a cast of already excellent talent she more than holds her own and probably steals the show.If you are looking for a direct comparison to The Shining then don't, this film stands alone as a fantastic horror come thriller. There are no jump scares or masses amount of gore but what you do have is a very well thought out, directed and acted film which develops steadily and builds to an excellent and at times jaw dropping climax.",Doctor Sleep

With the exception of IT 2, production kept going down and down the spiral... and now they all float...Just like Dark Towers, Doctor Sleep movie killed the magic of the book and made it a lengthy tasteless film that looks more like a late bad 90's TV show than a featured movie.Stop that massacre please!!!",Doctor Sleep

971,bryancheong96,Horror Thriller That Leans More Toward the Thriller side,6,9 April 2020,"'Doctor Sleep' is personally a disappointing sequel to the iconic cult classic 'The Shining', that sways toward being an superhero-eque action thriller rather than a psychological horror, and yet drags on way more than it should have, filled with unfulfilled build-up and directionless dialogue that poorly attempts to convey a deeper meaning. The plot of the film, although comparatively broader than that of 'The Shining', opts for a more shallow and straight-forward storytelling style. The acting was also rather dull and fails to evoke any sense of fear or desperation in the otherwise horrendous situations that the characters find themselves in. The set and costume/makeup design of the film's rendition of the Hotel and its ghostly residents is certainly nostalgic but fails to bring anything new to the table despite being almost 40 years apart from the original film; the same goes for the movie's run-of-the-mill cinematography and bland sound design. The visual effects of a certain astral projection scene were promising and actually entertaining to behold but the film detracts from that later on in the film and we are left with sloppy CGI scenes later on. All-in-all, the film is still an interesting watch for those who enjoy thrillers and those who are fond of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but don't expect anything that would evoke anywhere close to the same level of disturbance or terror as the classic film did back in 1980. 'Doctor Sleep' scores a 6.25/10.",Doctor Sleep
972,tiagokern17,Turning the Shining into a modern-day superhero movie,4,23 November 2019,"Regardless of what Stephen King thinks about the Kubrick adaptation of The Shining, it is still fondly remembered by movie lovers everywhere. This new movie, however praised by King as being a worthy adaptation of his novel, manages to fail where Kubrick succeeded. It's more of a slightly serious take on a superhero movie than a horror movie.There is absolutely nothing scary about this movie, not even the few jumpscares it tries to pull are successful, and worst of all: everything that seemed enigmatic or mysterious in Kubrick's The Shining is quickly explained away and dealt with.In the end, it's a very in-your-face movie about learning to deal with your own fears, traumas and even issues inherited/caused by one's family, rather than a horror movie that will leave you puzzling over the meaning of things or human nature. Every single horror element is fully explained, every mystery is revealed, every (simple) analogy is spelled out for you. Nothing is left to the imagination. Even the very ""Shining"" from the first movie, an otherworldly awareness that very few people had, is turned into X-men mutant-superhero-like powers in this one. And, oh, the reason that some people have the Shining? TO FIGHT EVIL. The whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" thing. Again. It's laughable.

And every time they died I rolled my eyes (like why did snakebite Andy turn into an old women, she would have been 23, and also why did Grampa have to die? There was a life time supply of steam in the trailer.) Then when Rose the hat finally gets hers...it's so anticlimactic. All the bad asses that Danny had locked up in the box just looked like a bunch of extras in the wrong movie.

984,alienheresure,One of 2019's Finest,8,11 January 2020,"I've waited a little bit to review this movie because I really didn't know what to say that hadn't already been said. Obviously it's got a fantastic cast and director. But as a follow up to one of the greatest pop culture icons in cinema history...does it really compare. My answer is simple: no, and you shouldn't compare it to 'The Shining'. I think it is a great disservice to this film if you try to compare these two because you'll have an apples and oranges scenario. 'Doctor Sleep' is a very different kind of movie than 'The Shining' and I think you could reason it as it's a continuation of a story already set up 40 years ago with Kubrick's masterpiece but told from a very different perspective. 'The Shining' is told almost exclusively from Jack Torrence's point of view, the view of a father who pretty much hates his family and is driven insane. But 'Doctor Sleep' is equally exclusively from Danny Torrence's point of view and though they are father and son they couldn't be any more different from each other. Danny, played spectacularly by Ewan McGregor, is a troubled man who has hit bottom. He suffers from ptsd (who wouldn't?) from what his father put him through. What I loved most in this movie was showing Danny be nothing like his dad. Sure, you get that scene in the third act where he's got the limp swinging an axe around, but this is due to what this hotel can do to a person. It's not who Danny is at heart. Jack was always that guy, just a case where it was only a matter of time before he went insane. What I'm getting at was it was nice to see someone not be overcome be evil, that good will triumph. It's hard to get that in a movie anymore without it feeling incredibly sappy. But this one pulled it off. I only had one flaw and that was with the scene where Danny and his friend (played by Cliff Curtis) gun down some of Rose the Hat's followers. It was so very out of place and character for Danny, someone who's probably never held a gun in his life. But overall I think of this film as a masterpiece in its own right. It's not trying to be 'The Shining' all over again (though there are some incredible tributes to it). It is very much it's own film with director Mike Flanagan's thumbprint just as the original classic has Kubrick's. I give 'Doctor Sleep' an A.I just learned that there will be a three hour extended cut on the blu ray release of 'Doctor Sleep' so I can't wait to see what that will contribute to already a very great film.",Doctor Sleep

I say surprisingly because I had a decently high hope with Ewan as lead but the idea of, what the trailer made it seem like, someone sucking out souls had me worried BUT it worked pretty dang well!The visuals of everything looked great and 95% of acting was flawless. I'm happy they made their idea work in such a fun and interesting way.SPOILERS BELOW:
I loved that they finally made an out of body outer space floating scene work without it being cheesy and easy to see it was green screen. Going back to the hotel and showing such cared for details really brought this all together.My few complaints was that we didn't a cameo from Jack Nicholson at least at the very end or somewhere even if it was for a couple seconds. My other complaint was how they did the scenes of breathing in the steam of the people - it just kinda felt unreal and almost cheesy.I'd see it again. 8.3/10",Doctor Sleep

I didn't get the sense of a typical three act structure. I laughed way to much for this being a horror movie. Rose the Hat and her ""cult"", if you want to call it that, were not scary whatsoever. They were almost comical, maybe that was done on purpose. The only things that got to me were the annoying jump scares. The dialogue and script were the worst part, I think. Our two mains are not terrible, yet not great either. Ewan McGregor really tries with what he is given. Not a fantastic or memorable score. Mike Flanagan had a tough job following The Shining, nearly forty years after its release. Especially in the last scenes, it depends to much on the previous work. I kept thinking that I would rather be at home watching The Shining on VHS with some microwave popcorn. I wasn't expecting that much from Doctor Sleep, but it didn't live up to the hype that Stephen King built up on Twitter.

And contrary to popular belief/opinion, Kubrick's The Shining film is absolutely terrible compared King's The Shining Novel. The Shining belongs to Stephen King, not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's 1980 film is not scary at all, has aged terribly, the acting in that movie is some of the worst I've ever seen, it's an absolutely horrible adaptation of King's Novel, and I can see why it was Nominated for ""Worst Director"" and ""Worst Actress"" at the Golden Raspberry Awards aka the Razzies in 1980 and why Stephen King hated it. The only good thing about it is that it is shot/filmed very very well technically, beautifully even, aesthetics wise. That's it though. Rest in peace to Stanley Kubrick, he was a great and very influential Director overall but his The Shining film really is one of the most overrated films of all time and is nowhere close to being as good as other Stephen King film adaptation like The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, Misery, and now Doctor Sleep and most of his fans are as obnoxious as it gets and if this film gets a low/lower rating, it's overly obsessed Kubrick fans, I'd bet money on it.Now onto Doctor Sleep. It is a great film. It's a great sequel to King's The Shining Novel and Kubrick's The Shining film while still being a good film adaptation of King's Doctor Sleep Novel. The acting is superb. Mike Flanagan is a damn great Director. Ewan McGregor delivers a great performance (as usual) as Dan Torrance. Kyliegh Curran gives a great performance as Abra Stone as well. That being said though, Rebecca Ferguson absolutely steals the show as Rose the Hat. Every single time she is on screen, she absolutely owns it and is, without a doubt, one of the very best villains in the Stephen King Universe..probably slightly behind IT/Pennywise, Randall Flagg, The Crimson King and Kurt Barlow but that's absolutely it though. She's definitely makes the top 5 of Stephen King villains. The character in the book was great but Rebecca Ferguson really gives an absolutely amazing, cool, creepy, scary, and really great performance as Rose the Hat. Very very evil. The cinematography in this film is brilliant. The writing/dialogue is great. The character development is great. The screenplay is excellent. Even the actors who played minor characters and such did a great job. This movie is the best Stephen King adaptation since either The Green Mile or The Shawshank Redemption. It's a great film in general as well. All of that said though, it's not perfect, but it'll still get a perfect score for me. 10/10.",Doctor Sleep

1. It is quite enjoyable and managed to keep me interest throughout even if it was 2 and a half hours long.
2. Cinematography and color grading. Even if this ones may seem un important they what make a film memorable from a visual point of view and it did a good jobCons:
1. Doesn't feel like a horror movie anymore. I say this because when I walked out of the theater I felt more like I just watched a Fantasy/adventure film than a horror movie. In The Shinning the ""action"" scenes were there because they represented his madness which end up being terrifying but in this the action scenes just feel like the classic bad guy vs good guy parts of a blockbuster.
2. Whats wrong with the girl? I think that their representation of a girl of a little girls is extremely inacurate because, I mean, what kind of little boy/girl acts like that, by the end of the movie she was just this heroine kind of existence that is super mature and can handle everything better than the adults around her. I seriously don't think thats how children would react to that kind of situations in real life",Doctor Sleep

Due his inner fight with his 6th sense (The Shining) and the ghosts from his past, Dani tries to drink away his past....this is where the story begins.....While i was a bit tired, the movie managed to make me fall asleep 2 times.
I felt left out of the center of the terror which grips me so strong in The Shining.
Seemly with newer effects en new story elements, this movie falls short by having way to much anticipation and build up to a climax which ultimatly is an anti climax.The music is way to good for the weaker story elements which tries to be mysterious but as soon as the movie starts, the plot it already opened up wide.
This movie isn't a true horror, it's not a thriller either.
This is more like a ghost story which you tell little kids before bed time.
Driven by overdone phantasmal voodoo type of magic.
It just doesn't hit the spot where it needs to hit.What makes this movie watchable is the Cast which all plays very wel in the role given.
The music and sound 7.1 whips you like cream inside your mind but makes expectation higher then what is actually displayed on screen.Stil giving this a solid 7 out of 10.ps: I have no idea why in God's name they gave this title Doctor Sleep....it makes no sense.

King is the biggest critic of Kubrick's version of The Shining, and I knew this was going to tie into that, but also had the goal of pleasing King himself, and I felt it manahed both of those. The first two-thirds of the movie stayed decently faithful to the novel, while the final third was much more of a connection to Kubrick's film, which, while normally would have bothered me, worked here.
A few parts felt rushed and a bit unnatural, but overall it was a very well done movie that gave a slightly altered story to the novel while holding its purpose.

1013,feelgooodinc,All work and no Kubrick makes King a good boy,6,10 June 2020,"Doctor Sleep (Director's Cut)Cliche Alert!!! Touching an old classic may have serious consequences to both past and present (hell, even future) timelines if not done carefully. Luckily, Warner Bros did find director Mike Flanagan who has a bit of a taste for the horror genre (see: Oculus, Hush, Ouija to name a few) and seems to have a peculiar fervour about both Stanley Kubrick's and Stephen King's 'The Shining' as he decided to single-handedly land this one by adapting the novel to the big screen before editing it together while, of course, overseeing directorial duties all along. Doing so that the end product would ideally satisfy fans of both the movie and the book.We are in present days. Smart phones and CGI poke us in the eye. Little Danny has grown up (now played by Ewan McGregor) and desperate to put old ghosts behind him. Still haunted by the traumatizing events at the Overlook Hotel and running away from his past he finds shelter as well as friends in a small town. Gets to know little girl, Abra (Kyliegh Curran) who also has the shining. We soon find out there are waaay more people around with the supernatural power who intend to use it for bad things. What's more they are sort of a cult, led by the charming Rose (Rebecca Ferguson) and call themselves 'The True Knot'. They hunt people with the shine in them (have been doing so for milennia in fact, as this not so decent habit grants them longer lives) only to suck the 'steam' out of them while torturing and eventually killing their prey. Hence the board is set. It's grown up Danny and little Abra against the baddies.Fortunately, we are to experience a sequel that doesn't dwell on its predecessor but slowly and carefully builds up a new world (the three-hour runtime of the director's cut certainly leaves enough time for that) with a compelling narrative that registers a few new exciting as well as some less exciting characters while paying homage to the original movie and unsurprisingly climaxing within those gloomy blood-filled corridors where it all made its way out from introducing a few clever twists on a classic.Now, we could be pulling our hair out on why certain things are played as they are and why would the filmmakers decide to use unnecessary CGI and fix glowing eyes on villains or create fake steam coming out of people not to mention the irritating death of 'The True Knot' members turning into rotting corpses in a blink of an eye before evaporating into thin air. Thankfully, it only takes seconds per deaths.Instead, we can appreciate all the hard work put into this one and as long as we are willing to overlook (haha) the lack of genius from the creators both behind and front of the camera (with a few exceptions I might swiftly add) and stop comparing it with Kubrick's eerie masterpiece it can easily become a rather enjoyable but terrifying popcorn-flick.Flanagan's work is, without a doubt, truly remarkable. He is also making the right decisions by recasting certain roles instead of going to de-aging territory as well as not relying on banal jump scares. Wittily hiding hundreds of trivial references to King's other works - implying that this one takes place in the same universe as many other stories by the master of horror - will amuse the fans. The director also teases us with glimpses of the eminent helicopter shot nicely re-edited as this time Danny is driving up into the mountains which would be nowhere near as effective without including the spine-chilling score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind that still continues to haunt us after 40 years.
Oh, and the twins! The twins are also back...dare you to look!Verdict:6/10
While Doctor Sleep is certainly entertaining and Mike Flanagan does his very best at pulling the strings it can never live up to its predecessor due to the lack of shine around the production which is more like an appraisal of the former than a criticism of the follow-up.",Doctor Sleep
1014,dar_k_ling,A thrilling return to the Overlook,10,30 October 2019,"Having previously adapted the source material of Stephen King, with the chilling 'Gerald's Game', Mike Flanagan had the impossible task of following up Stanley Kubrick's iconic adaptation of 'the Shining'. Almost 40 years later, Flanagan succeeded in seamlessly picking up directly where Kubrick left off; a team effort from the direction, performances of the cast, the score and cinematography.
The ensemble of Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson, Emily Alyn Lynd, Dick Hallorann, Cliff Curtis, Bruce Greenwood and Alex Essoe worked together tremendously to deliver powerhouse performances with many humorous moments.
It would be unfair not to highlight Kyliegh Curran, for her standout portrayal of Abe's Stone; this generations Danny Torrance.
While Kubrick's original infamously came across as misogynistic, Flanagan does a complete 360, with many strong female characters present in this film.
As with 'the Shining', there is a lot of King's symbolism of the impact of alcoholism and recovery.
'Doctor Sleep' is an exciting and fast paced thriller, with plenty of scares, thrills and moments of laughter. While not as slow and dreary as 'the Shining', it still holds up to the original and will be sure to remain a classic of the horror genre and fans of Stephen King.",Doctor Sleep

1019,samtruby,Poor writing,4,18 March 2020,"Mike Flanagan is a great horror director, and that is what he should stick to instead of writing. The haunting of Hill House was great in parts but the writing was truly awful and doctor sleep follows suit which is a shame. There is an overabundance of melodrama which makes everything feel a little naff.",Doctor Sleep

1021,theninjew-626-629752,What a Movie Should Be,9,17 June 2020,"This movie, like it's namesake, seems to be a sleeper hit for me as well as the public's reception to it. It wasn't until a week or so after I watched it that I realized I kept thinking back to moments in the movie, and how impactful they were. Re-watching it again, I've come to realize that this movie does what a good movie should: It shows, and doesn't tell. Doesn't force a feeling or perspective on you.And because of that, the drama that takes shape is somehow a bit personal because we've filled in the details ourselves. Even setting by the wayside the incredible job they did in re-creating the tone and feel of the Overlook in the 3rd act, this movie is a masterpiece in it's understated way.It's a testament to the filmmakers that they were able to not only make a sequel to a Kubrick movie, but create a powerful and sometimes very frightening world of their own without borrowing anything more from it's predecessor more than the world.",Doctor Sleep
1022,Deep-Space,I very much enjoyed this BUT...,9,1 August 2020,I very much enjoyed this BUT...It was shot more like a *series* than a movie.It SHOULD have been an 8 - 10 episode *series* rather than a 2.5 hour movie.There was SO much to explore that could have been fleshed out in a series format rather than sloppily cramming everything in a movie-length project.I bet I'm not the only one who picked-up on that...,Doctor Sleep
1023,aocorzo,Boring and basic,4,18 January 2020,"I am not going to compare this movie to The Shining. Having read the book, I have always been a bit disappointed by Kubrick's take on it. I have also read Doctor Sleep, not King's best work, definitely not as gripping as the Shining but entertaining enough. Now the movie although it tries its best for the first half, falls very flat the rest of the movie. Even without reading the book you can feel that some scenes do not make sense, the characters for the most part are shallow and ephemeral. Most disappointing of all is that the book has been rewritten to accommodate the Overlook scenes, most likely for marketing purposes. Doctor Sleep did not try to stand on its own legs or find its own identity with just the right amount of homage to The Shining, it tried to copy it. As a result, it feels forced, nonsensical and far from an horror movie. The only scary thing about this movie is McGregor dull performance.",Doctor Sleep
1024,rockstar1226,Better than the shinning,10,5 July 2020,"Ignore the low ratings unless you don't have a brain . I guess people need gore for a horror movie to be good , or a movie that Doesn't actually has a story to tell .
I had heard from a friend , with a brain , lol, it was good . A boy was it ! Great storyline , awesome acting , one of kings best !
The shining had some very memorable scenes , but other than that , I never thought it was that great . Never really understood the movie , nor did it ever rate high on the horror scale for me .

1025,descriptive_wall,Doctor Sleep is Rose the Hat,10,18 July 2020,"I'm a massive fan of Stanley Kubrick's pictures, especially The Shining. I was very excited to see another director attempt to tread on such hallowed ground. And then to have it be Stephen King's words. Those are big shoes to fill.. But I wasn't disappointed. It just took me a few months and a few watches. Over two hours Is rough for some of us!Score was perfect. Not jumpy. Most importantly, the tonality I felt like it was on point. Especially with certain actors. For me, the one that held and kept my attention the most was Rose the Hat. Best Stephen King villain easily. A true dichotomy. Attractive, charming, comforting, yet very violent and deviant. Extremely riveting to watch.Rebecca Ferguson brought it all to life. It's mesmerizing to watch her. If anyone is channeling the incomparable Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance, even Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange, she is vibrating right on that frequency.",Doctor Sleep
1026,RaveyDaveyGravy,"Pretty good, but was it intended as a sequel?",7,3 November 2019,"I grew up with The Shining as my favourite horror film, and still love it today. Can anything live up to that masterpiece? Well, no. But Dr Sleep is a good attempt.However, I think you can almost spot the points in the narrative where this has been re-moulded into a Shining sequel. It feels to me that someone, somewhere, looked over Stephen Kings shoulder, and spotted the opportunity to change a character to Danny Torrance, and slide the Overlook Hotel in for maximum recognition. Hey presto, it's the Shining 2!So, the bits that work best are the non Shiningy bits. When Danny IS Dr Sleep, helping people pass happily. When he's communicating through his blackboard. His friendships. Here the film is lovely, spookily, but lovely. Where it struggles is when it feels the need to be a Shining sequel.Rebecca Ferguson is brill, even if her accent is all over the UK at times, and Ewan McGregor is better than he's been in years. Oh and in the age of de-aging CGI, the use of look-alikes took me out of the story.Cracking film, lots of fun, beautifully shot, but for me should have been kept separate to truly shine.",Doctor Sleep

1029,hotrican1976,Watch it...,8,11 November 2019,Mysterious and terrifyingly beautiful is all I can say about this film. If you're a King fan you most definitely watch this movie. The action can drag at times making this a long movie at times but no more than the average block buster.,Doctor Sleep
1030,shard66,Utterly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.,9,12 June 2021,"I held off on watching this film for nearly two years because of so many bad reviews when it came out in 2019. But due to spending the past sixteen months in relative isolation due to the problems brought on by the 2020 pandemic, I was finally running out of new shows or movies to stream that I had any interest in seeing. Then ""Doctor Sleep"" popped up in a ""recommended viewing"" list and I figured ,""What the heck? I'll give it a shot.""I'm very glad I did. I was a teenager when Kubrick's ""The Shining"" came out and, already having been a huge fan of Kubrick by then, I enjoyed the hell out of ""The Shining"". I was never a Stephen King fan and hadn't ever read the book that was the inspiration for the movie. I've watched it countless times since then and it still holds up. Well, zoom up to present day and I found that ""Doctor Sleep"" played very well off of the storyline of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". It not only offered a reasonable display of the affect that the experience from the first movie had on one of its surviving characters but it also played up on it and evolved the character tremendously. I'm being careful here to not have any spoilers, of course.As a sequel, a film should meet certain criteria. It should build upon the original film's storyline. It should show a progression of the remaining characters, story, or locations. And it should also include something new to the overall tale and not just be a rehash of the same plot all over again (I'm looking at you ""Lethal Weapon"" movies). ""Doctor Sleep"" hit on all three points with a bullet.The homage to the first film was not only done very well but with almost a love letter to Kubrick's vision. You can tell that Mike Flanagan tried hard to offer up at least a touch of Kubrick and in some scenes, you almost feel that you're back at Kubrick's Overlook Hotel back in the 70's all over again. There is that constant sense of dread throughout which is very core of the essence of anything having to do with ""The Shining"". There are no moments where the audience is given a break from the intensity of the tale by laughing at some casual moment in the film. No, the pacing is smooth and steady all the way to the build-up when the story takes an unexpected, yet fantastic, sudden turn to carry things through to the finale. I honestly found myself rooting and cheering on the inside while firmly affixed to the images playing out before my widened eyes.If you are a true fan of the original film and can approach this sequel with an open mind and eyes of wonder, then don't put it off any longer - watch this movie now!And a special kudos to Kyliegh Curran for her portrayal of Abra. When Abra first appeared on the screen, I thought, ""Oh great, we're about to drop back into the 80's where nearly every on-screen hero has a 'cute, wise-crackin', little kiddie' as a sidekick."" Kyliegh proved me wrong and I thoroughly enjoyed her performance! Every actor delivers in this film. And Flanagan got every ounce of story out of them and on the silver screen.In a word, ""Excellent!""",Doctor Sleep
1031,levi_hartline,A great sequel to Kubrick's shining as well as a fitting adaptation of Kings novel.,8,22 January 2020,"I have read both the shining and doctor sleep and while its often tedious work, adapting a 600+ ppage novel, this film not only captures the magic of the book but also bridges both kings and kubricks very different shining's. McGregor nails his performance and Flanagan continues to show he is a force to be beckoned with in the horror genre.Most of the criticism ive read is about Stepehen King's weird little nuances which leads me to believe most of them are more fans of cinema horror than S.

But don't think that this film is like The Shining, because it is not.

1041,Curmudgeonist,Not perfect but you won't care!,9,31 October 2019,"Spoilers ahead. A little slow at the beginning in the same style as the original movie. Once it gets going though it was great. Loved the villains. Definitely made me hate them. Loved the new character, Abra. Loved the ghost mentor and Danny turning the tables on the hotel ghosts with the boxes.
Loved the Dark Tower references.Some minor stuff wasn't perfect which is why a 9/10. Danny's friend/sponsor seemed thrown away without much emotional affect or logic. He and Danny were approaching the RV together. The girl comes out and lucky for her Danny is out of ammo but doesn't notice? Then his friend is nowhere to be found while she is about to kill him until the cliché close eyes gunshot, bad guy gets shot scene. Wtf was he doing behind the car all of a sudden??
The scene in the hotel with taking her into the hedge. Cool but why didn't the leg cuts carry over to when she came out. And a better plan would be get her into Danny's head and while she's running around a maze in her mind, Abra runs up and kills or incapacitates her back in real life. The scenes of Danny turning into bad and chasing Abra around the hotel were not great. She looked like she was barely jogging for one. And it was just kinda cheesy and in service to a callback.With all that being said I was sorry to lose Danny but I like the passing of the torch and that he lives on as an Obi Wan force/shine/steam ghost for Abra. Great stuff and I hope they make more with more Stephen King connected universe villains for her to fight and different Shine users to discover.Not perfect but with the minor exceptions I mentioned, I loved it! Definitely recommend!",Doctor Sleep

The question from the first movie that is still stuck in my mind is that weird bear scene with two guys towards the end. Such a weird and out of it scene.

It's shot really well, but instead of being a thought provoking horror film like it's predecessor, it's basically spooky Suicide Squad. The villains are so one-dimensional and silly, and the whole thing feels like fan fiction set in the world of The Shining. Ewan McGregor does a great job, as always, but almost everything else feels really goofy and forced. It's hardly even scary, save for one or two good jump scares. Beyond that it's a bad superhero movie with The Shining nostalgia thrown in.",Doctor Sleep

This sets off a chain of events in which Danny becomes something of a mentor and eventually it leads us back to the Overlook Hotel. This movie, although a direct sequel, feels separate from The Shining and while it was an entertaining and sometimes even an emotional watch, I left the theatre somewhat dissatisfied.",Doctor Sleep

It has no real suspense and the buildup leads to nothing, its plot is cliche as they come akin to any superhero film and the whole highlight of the films seems to be references to the original movie, not even references but 1:1 remake shots of the original film, just why? why is this a thing? Great, danny is on his father footsteps, but whats the point and why should i care? you expect it to all come together but after 3 hours there is no payoff, you waster the time and money, the whole message is ""yeah, the kubrick film is cool"". Scenes drag on forever, it tries to use some of kubricks techniques but it lacks any sense of pacing and weight to it. I don't care about any of the characters, everyone is a placeholder to move the weak plot forward and you basically now how is going to play out 30 minutes in.But yeah, cool you got a jack Nicholson impersonator to remake the entire bar sequence , cool, danny is the one with the axe in the stair sequence, cool, some random character i don't care about is on the maze.

The story is quite good actually and how they involve shinning scenes makes it overall good connection of both movies. How they introduce some characters to the movie like they're going to be the center of the movie and turns out they're just some characters to make it interesting is great to some people and to others it will be big downside on story making. It isn't some scary movie that gonna make you scream so if you're looking for some scary movies then this isn't for you.

1053,vnewton-77136,Real potential but a big disappointment...,4,11 July 2020,"I felt, like many, that despite Jack Nicholson's over the top performance, the film of The Shining didn't do the book justice. Dr. Sleep is guilty of this as well. Adding numerous scenes & characters from the previous film seemed downright lazy & really took away from the tense plot line of the book. No spoiler alert here but how did the director fail to recall that the Overlook Hotel burned down?! Just asking, but why on earth did he eliminate almost all the adversaries before the climax? From that point on Dr. Sleep nearly lulled me out. As to the casting, Ewan McGregor was an excellent choice but Kyliegh Curran as Abra was very wooden & one dimensional (Millie Bobbie not available?). Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat lacked any real depth & never seemed like a truly ancient, evil monster. The director resorted to glowing eyeballs right out of Children of the Damned...so cheesy! He should have used good old fashioned dramatic lighting & sound effects to portray torture rather than gratuitous (Shaun of the Dead) realism. Apparently they don't teach that in film school any more. Again, much of this (overly long) film seemed just plain lazy & a real shame it didn't do a great read any justice.",Doctor Sleep
1054,jenisedong,Enjoyed it a little more than I thought,8,10 November 2019,"I didn't have a ton of expectations going into this movie but I thoroughly enjoyed The Shining (like much of the human population) so I was expecting a good continuation of the original story line. Overall I think Mike Flanagan was able to deliver.
The way the movie was filmed and edited really exemplified a typical horror movie. Doctor sleep includes a constant mist in the settings, there are a lot of dramatic slow panoramic shots, and the music is eerie and impactful.
The acting is pretty decent but in my opinion Rebecca Ferguson absolutely shined as Rose the Hat. Ferguson put in so much emotion into her character and her expressions throughout the movie were just so unsettling, it was pure perfection.
I didn't find Doctor Sleep to be very scary I might classify it as more thriller, there were a few jump scares and a few shots disgusted me but nothing really shook me to my core, which is fine.
Overall as an avid fan of horror movies and King I enjoyed this movie a lot and might even say it's one of the best horror movies of the year.",Doctor Sleep

1059,augustdraper,A Brilliant Sequel,9,11 November 2019,"An amazing sequel and the perfect homage to both Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick. Almost everything feels right in this film. From the brilliant actors to the unsettling score, everything falls into place. I have often times had trouble with sequels being made almost forty years after their originals (i.e. Star Wars, Blade Runner), but this felt like a sequel. It felt like it was placed in the same universe as The Shining. Mike Flanagan was the perfect choice for writing and directing this film, and in my opinion the only choice. Mike is quite good at making this kind of horror (If you have watched The Haunting of Hill House, you will get what I mean). He understands it. He has made a film that caters to both King's and Kubrick's vision while adding the mike flanagan style to it with his distinct shots and color correcting. The part that really blew me away was the return to the Overlook Hotel. The recreation of the iconic shots of The Shining just... blew me away. I don't know how else to describe it, but here comes my one critique of the film. I wish there was more time spent at the Overlook because it is the staple of both films. It is what makes The Shining The Shining. It would have been nice to see Danny confronting his demons more because to me, that is the more riveting part of the story. The scene where Danny talks to Jack as the bartender (this scene surprised me in the best way) was moving and kept me on the edge of my seat. This film is about Danny confronting the things he has repressed and pushed away for years and years, so that should be the focus. I wanted more of those scenes, confronting the spirits from The Shining. Otherwise, I couldn't have asked for anything more. Everything that I didn't mention in this review was phenomenal and I feel bad for not mentioning them. Therefore, I'm concluding this review by saying go watch this movie for yourself, if you liked The Shining and are skeptical to see if this sequel will live up to it. Mike Flanagan has created a work of art and deserves more than 7.7 . So please, go see this film and give it the attention it deserves.",Doctor Sleep
1060,mandyinman,The new Halloween 3: The Season of the Witch.,2,18 November 2019,"Well ok I'm sorry if this is a long message but here goes...so to start I'm biased a bit I must admit. Because the shining, is one of my favorite films. And to follow something so good and suspenseful and those masterful shots of Kubrick, would be near impossible regardless if I thought the movie was good or not. Take terminator for example, the first one was great. The second one was a masterpiece. Because they had more to add that was needed. Time Paradox explanations, switching the terminators to add the extra is don't trust you' factor between two good guys with Sarah and Arnold, they added a MUCH needed, cooler, better terminator. Then explained there are many types. Then explained how all this is possible and why it was done. Not to mention the story to action ratio was spot on. Now back to doctor sleep. I feel that the shining was so good, that it needed no improvements. And adding ANYTHING unless it's needed for a story like this just doesn't seem right to me. The whole reason I feel they added the 'steam' aspect, is because they needed a reason as to why a girl would even care to chase down Danny; into what we all waited for (being seeing the old hotel one last time). I was confused as to how those things in his mind could kill the lady and not him, but only inhabit him. I didn't see the need for the little girl, or the other kids, or the other characters other then Danny. To put it in a way that is simple and pure. 'They're characters who have no character' totally boring people with what seems to be loose motivation. I was hoping it would be more a story of how he grew up afterwards. showing shots every so often of like say 'ok here's a bit of him immediately after the shining, here's him at 12, now 16, now 18, now a young adult of 20-25.' Then showing his troubles of coping, what was his life like while he was being tourtured, how he must triumph over his fear; less he become like his father and join the darkness instead of conquering it, then him going to face his fear of the hotel alone for one last night of scares and haunting memories come to life. :) instead the movie was about a bunch of mutants who had telepathy and could make peoples will bend at will. And ALOT of talking. They ended up instead of adding anything new or exciting to it, they just copied things. Like the encounter on the stairs, and the ballroom gag, and the boiler room reunion. Nothing new. Everything that was added was just a copy in my opinion. A callback if you will. However it's just my opinion and I apologize for lack of grammar skills. so yeah my personal rating 2/10 not scary. Just...a movie.",Doctor Sleep

It did, it was just scary enough and got me with a few jump scares. There was only one hard to watch scene and I was so involved with the characters. Ten out of Ten, when this movie comes out on disc; it's going on my shelf.",Doctor Sleep

And, the director's cut..",10,17 January 2021,"A fantastic story on it's own, is a mesmerizing continuation of the events in ""The Shining.""So well crafted and nuanced in the storytelling, that after multiple viewings, still begets the feeling, ""blown away.""I discovered the Director's cut just days after a second viewing with a friend (her first time) and as soon as we came upon it, we looked at each other and nodded. Damn right we wanted more. This world is immersive, and terrifying, and the delivery, powerful.Gives a solid nod to Stanley Kubrick while remaining faithful to the original story, I found this to be one of the very few film experiences that will give me chills, a full range of emotions, and more chills, with every single viewing.Bravo.The director's cut adds a few extra additions to the story, that i found to be for a more enveloping story than the theatrical release. Both by any standard were phenomenal in my eyes.So inspired was i to go back into Flanagan's other films, which have been very enthralling as well. I guess you could call me a fan now.",Doctor Sleep
1066,sherm44,I liked this more than I thought I would,9,9 February 2020,I was prepared to hate this movie. I'm a huge fan of both novels and a huge Stephen King fan. I'm accustomed to seeing horrible SK movie adaptations but I always watch them with high hopes. I was surprised by this. It held pretty tight to the novel while still respecting Kubrick's vision of The Shining. I'm guessing that was a difficult tightrope to walk for the screenwriter. I think he pulled it off pretty well and I think the acting and effects were excellent.,Doctor Sleep
1067,woofinstien-43254,Good but not that different.,8,13 November 2019,"Doctor sleep is one of the best Stephen King movies created this year, especially after the disappointing IT Chapter 2. The movie succeeds in telling a chilling story, but nothing too different then what you've seen before. The most surprising part which impressed me was the amount of characters that reappeared from ""The Shining"", including the crazy Jack Torrence, Danny Torrence, Wendy Torrence, Dick Halloran and the ghosts of the Overlook. The recasting was also done well of these characters, but seeing Jack Nicholson come back would have probably been better. The rest of the cast does a good job, especially Danny played by Ewan McGregor and Rose played by Rebecca Ferguson. The plot is a bit disturbing, probably because it's about a cult who hints and tortures children. It does get a bit slow in the middle but the movie overall is pretty good, nothing too special but if you really enjoyed the shining, you should watch this.",Doctor Sleep

The overwhelming feeling when watching was one of coming close to the source of evil. Watching Doctor Sleep, all I felt was, that this was a pretty typical Stephen King story. Stanley must have removed the silly and unnecessary elements, only presenting us with the essence of coming close to elemental evil. I now realise, that's why he was a true great and that Doctor Sleep is nothing more than a silly attempt at a horror movie , following all of the authors story , without using any creative discretion. The occasional reference to The Shining really only offended because this was the most blatant example of a pigmy standing on the shoulders of a genius.",Doctor Sleep

But other than that, this movie is really forgettable. I wouldve gave it a 1. Nothing new or interesting is done here.

But if you ask whether he succeeded, I say no. It would be more accurate to look at this movie as a decent Stephen King adaptation rather than a sequel to The Shining.On the other hand, the whole movie seems like a tribute to Kubrick. For example, the camera angles used when Danny was interviewing for a job, driving or navigating the hotel, the famous theme music played on the way to the Overlook hotel... All of this was a homage to Kubrick.I wish the fantasy part had been reduced a little (especially towards the end) and focused on the tension.

1083,sohailkulkarni,Doctor sleep keeps the 'Shine' intact !!!,7,19 July 2020,"Doctor sleeps version was pretty much doing justice by depicting that it is actually a sequel to the orginal 'The shining' the movie preceded by the novel,
There's no shade of a doubt that THE SHINING was the best supernatural horrors that shook entire America by the sheer chills and epic spooky thrills it had, needless to mention Jack Nickolsons performance was phenomenal the way he naturally portrayed Mr.Torrances transformation throughout the movieDoc Sleep entails the same version of the father-son legacy which continues here as well after 40 years of the prequel, ofcourse apart from the slow paced plot and lesser horror chills this one does completely keep you glued towards the storyline
The first 40 minutes of the movie are pretty abrupt with the protagonists journey and few references to the past, but once you are through it latter part serves complete experience you expect from a perfect thriller sequel

Since it came out in fact but I could never get myself to watch it out of fear that it will only live to disappoint. And it did, in my eyes. The feeling that The Shining left me with cannot be found here. This was just an action movie with a pinch of mystery/thriller flavour added to it. The suspense feeling was nowhere to be found. I believe that it should have been the other way 'round, and I would have given it more than the 7 that I am giving it now but It ain't a 6 nor an 8 so 7 feels just right.

King had some issues with the Kubrick's movie because he finds Kubrick's version cold,stripped of its primary purpose which was to tell the story. Shinings movie adaptation also ends differently from the book.However King read the script of this movie beforehand and said 'Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of 'The Shining' is redeemed for me here."" You will be watching the grown up version of the Danny from the Shining, new characters and a much different plot which is not exaclty what you expect if you didn't read the book.It's defineitly not a horror movie, rather a thrill with some action to the end. Some death happens so sudden and quick that you can't even find time to feel sorry as the characters moves over so fast about what happens. It has some cliches that makes you not fully enjoy the plot. It's typical bad guys lose good guys win situtation with some casualties on the way.All in all not a bad movie considering how much effort has been put on this film, nice acting and cinematography saves a lot from how low it would've scored. Nice thriller which puts you in a chilling mood in the evening.",Doctor Sleep
1103,inceneritoreintrepido,Blasphemously based on The Shining but still good,6,21 August 2020,"I have mixed feelings. On one side I think every sane person who has seen The Shining should take deep offense on how the basement of novel was used to build towards a vampire-like stereotype plot. In this movie the Shining, which was something enigmatic in the Kubrick's take, becomes basically simple cliche' Holliwoodian superpowers. Even the reminders of the old movie seem forcibly placed without too much narrative logic.
The movie could really have been better off by NOT claiming to be based on S. King's The Shining and that also means it's actually not a bad movie. If, not without effort, I forget the attempt to be based on the King's novel (I really can't understand King's approval of this), I can say I enjoyed it. There are some memorable moments. Acting has ups and (tolerable) downs.

A juxtaposition to movies like The Terminator and Star Wars sequels by not trying to desperately reincorporate old cast members and characters nostalgic purposes.Ewan McGregor is one of the most underrated actors working today in my opinion and he's at his best here.

It is an amazing adaptation of the book, very faithful except for some shocking deaths that I wasn't expecting. In order to connect more with The Shining, the last third differs from the book and returns to the Overlook Hotel, but what a payoff ! By burning the hotel just like in the original book, Stephen King has earned his revenge on Kubrick. Even though Dan doesn't die in the book, I think the ending fits perfectly the spirit of the movie.
Mike Flanagan did a very good job directing (see also The Haunting of Hill House), and the actors are all exceptional (especially Rebecca Ferguson and Kyliegh Curran). I hope that Mike Flanagan will continue to adapt Stephen King's books, he always does a great job !",Doctor Sleep

No. As you've read in other reviews this is not going to work for you if you expect a sequel to The Shining. On its own the movie stands fairly well. I had to cringe when they tried re-casting actors that appear to be Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, & Scatman Crothers. Why? Why would you do this and in my opinion super cheesy and instant rating loss from me. There are a number of nods to Kubrick; the aerial view of the road to The Overlook (albeit at night), trying to revive Wendy Carlos synths throughout, and they use the same office that the interview took place in The Shining for Danny's chat with the Doc from AA. All cute but cringe-worthy and delivered in poor form. Sorry but copying Kubrick does not make you Kubrick. So where does this go right? The Knot. Hate the film or love it you want to know more about The Knot. It is one of the most intriguing villainous entities. What is their history? Who are they? You didn't tell me and I love you for doing that! There nothing worse than a mystery that is revealed. I want to be kept up trying to figure out who the characters in The Knot are, and I was... and despite your complaints and the film's flaws so were you!

1118,lemmonsherbets,A worthy continuation to its predecessor,8,2 November 2019,"I first watched The Shining 2 years ago on the eve of my Dad's wedding night. All I can say is that I was mightily impressed at how Stanley Kubrick had made a film of the horror genre that still stood strong amongst others of the 21st and 20th centuries. I was left wondering at what the chaotic and threatening childhood of Danny Torrance would lead to; and it was announced earlier this year, along with a trailer, of the 40 year awaited sequel: Doctor Sleep.It's safe to say that I left the cinema feeling fulfilled. Ewan McGregor stars as the recovering alcoholic and homeless Danny, with which he executes the role superbly; he steals every scene, and plays to the written character with a strong sense of reality. The scenes in which he is known as ""Doctor Sleep"" should hopefully tug at one's heartstrings, and I felt almost proud that a power of someone so strong (still referred to as ""The Shining"") could be used for such a humanitarian-based theme of making someone's last breaths feel belonging and comfort. The cinematography is also beautifully crafted and shot, much like other recent Stephen King adaptations such as IT and Pet Sematary. As for the film's plot, I was satisfied throughout and felt the narrative structure was directed with style, however, I couldn't quite take the idea seriously of a hippie style villain and her cronies sucking children's ""steam"" away. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Rebecca Ferguson's performance as 'Rose the Hat', although I felt she did slice the ham too thick. The homage to the film's prequel was truly a work of art, especially one scene which is shot-for-shot of the opening to The Shining, giving fans a strong dose of nostalgia, especially with the original soundtrack! As for the film's ending, it may indeed choke you up with held-back tears of sorrow, yet feeling happy at how the story of Danny Torrance and the world of The Shining has come to its conclusion.Doctor Sleep is a perfect sequel to its near 40 year-old predecessor, and a tense, emotive and informative tale at how a carefully crafted horror can represent many of our species' deepest thoughts and fears.",Doctor Sleep

1129,jamesmgarand,Fantastic sequel to The Shining.,10,7 November 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. It's a very different type of film than The Shining. I will say this though and I don't care who disagrees with me.....the acting is much better overall in this film than in The Shining. This was also a great way for Mike Flanagan to pay homage to the best writer of the past 50+ years, or at least since he came into the game, at the very least (Stephen King...yes, Stephen King is better than Dean Koontz, Anne Rice, Clive Barker, etc) and Stanley Kubrick, one of the best Directors and certainly one of the most influential Directors of all time. Mike Flanagan did a great job with this film. Doctor Sleep is at it's best when it's being it's own movie. It didn't need The Shining to be really good. It did that on it's own and I wish it would've been like that the whole film. At the same time though, it was cool, nostalgic, and still fun to go back and visit The Shining at times. Lol. I'm trying to be careful with my words and not spoil anything. I also thought Mike Flanagan did a masterful job at making an overall faithful (for the most part) adaptation of the Doctor Sleep Novel by Stephen King and making a sequel to both Stephen King's The Shining Novel and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining film. That had to be an incredibly difficult thing to do but Mike Flanagan pulled it off very well. Kudos to him for that. A job well done.I think King/the novel fans and Kubrick/the movie fans will like Doctor Sleep. Heck, I've always preferred The Shining Novel by Stephen King over Stanley Kubrick's The Shining movie and even I enjoyed this Doctor Sleep film as not just a sequel to The Shining Novel but also as a sequel to The Shining movie. Great job, Flanagan. Great job to everyone involved. I liked IT Chapter Two. I thought it was overall good or at least had more good things about it than bad. I also liked a couple of other Stephen King adaptations from this year and I think they're good as well but I do believe Doctor Sleep is the best of the bunch.PS, don't believe all of the negative reviews of this film. Only a couple of them (that I've read) make a couple of valid criticisms. The rest just come off as Internet trolls or extreme Stanley Kubrick/The Shining movie fans or just don't like Stephen King the person, maybe due to his open political views or the fact that he hates Kubrick's The Shining movie or whatever. Just go see this film if you truly want to know whether you'll like it or not. I give it a 9/10 and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was really good.",Doctor Sleep

The fact that this worked so well, considering that huge obstacle, is remarkable in my book.I think this movie is quite brilliant and Mike Flanagan is the cream of the crop of suspense scary stories- (I don't want to call them horror, because his story telling is way to sophisticated to be lumped in with today's horror movie jump scares and one dimensional characters).This film is very impressive and the creepy atmosphere that runs through the story leaves you on the edge of your seat just as much as a good jump scare will. The use of current actors remaking scenes that originally had Jack Nicholas, Shelley Duvall and Scatman Crothers was tastefully done, and did not feel like a parody of their acting styles, but more of an impression of the actual characters and their appearance in the Shining.I hope Flanagan does a sequel to Abra Stone's story, which he's spoken with Stephen King about making.

1137,michaelwelch016,"A slow-burn return to Danny and the gift he calls ""The Shining""",8,10 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep, although not perfect, is a well-done return to the world of The Shining. I've heard this film be considered more of a dark fantasy than horror and I would to an extent agree. This film does not hold the slow building tension of The Shining, nor does it have scares placed evenly throughout as many modern horrors often do. The film is a slow burn, using horror and action elements sparingly with purpose as it builds the narrative. It follows Dan Torrance in the aftermath of the traumatizing events that unfolded at the Overlook Hotel. He, a drifter, soon cleans himself up and finds purpose aiding young fellow shiner Abra in surviving villain Rose the Hat and the True Knot's pursuit of her. During which, we learn the true extent of ""shining"" and what this power both is and can do. The film spends a considerable amount of time rotating between Dan, Abra, and Rose, as well as exploring their abilities. Following a fantastic beginning, the movie slows down as we get to know our characters... but perhaps a little too much at times given the general small amount of interesting events taking place. Despite knowing I'd be bored on a second watch, it serves as a necessary lag allowing us to deeply know who and what we're dealing with, which in turn makes the following acts of the narrative more impactful. These characters then get mixed up with one another and the plot excitingly moves forward until it reaches the climax where it all began- The Overlook Hotel. There are a fair share of great moments and strong development in the new ground of Doctor Sleep, but the highlight is undoubtedly what unfolds in the familiar setting of The Shining.This movie really stands on it's own in terms of story. Being a sucker for lore and world building, the expansion on the concept of ""shining"" and what it entails really kept me intrigued while the characters and conflict kept me entertained, save for a half hour or so. The way this film is crafted as a slow burn is precisely what I expected from director Mike Flanagan, known for The Haunting of Hill House. Despite some sequences venturing into boredom...the conflict, characters, surreal moments, uncomfortable moments, and finale are enough to make this one of my favorite Stephen King adaptations.",Doctor Sleep
1138,oyasuna,We all keep shining on,8,9 November 2019,"""You'd be surprised what a person can deal with.""
Dan TorranceWell hi there 🌹🎩✨For all we know, the movie is surely what it says on the poster, a sequel to The Shining. It is originally from a novel then made into a film adaption by Stanley Kubrick in 1980 which starred Jack Nicholson as the father wielding axe in it's second act.I just watched this two days ago with my boyfriend at a theatre in a mall located at the top floor at 6:15. We sat on row C on numbers 10 and 11 where we also had our drinks to fuel us during its runtime.The movie sets up with Dan Torrance brilliantly played by Ewan Mcgregor, who is still suffering trauma concerning his past. He is all grown up now and is trying his best to surpress his Shine abilities by resorting to heavy booze. He then chooses to move to a small town where he finds a place to stay and befriends Billy Freeman. Then and there, Dan rehabilitates and soon finds a job at the hospital where he is referred to as ""Doctor Sleep"" because of utilizing his Shine abilities to comfort dying patients.While all this is happening, Rose The Hat played by Rebecca Ferguson is the leader of a cult called the True Knot formed by the people with the Shine abilities nearing to their
edge, and so they abduct innocent children who possesses the same abilities to suck out steam to prolong their age. There is also Abra Stone played by Kyliegh Curren in her film debut as a young girl who eventually becomes their target and befriends Dan throughout the movie.The movie is two and a half hours long, though i did not feel that during its runtime. It did an impeccable job on making me grip at the edge of my seat fearful for all these characters as well as inserting the feeling of uncomfort throughout every scene. It also has great acting, in particular for Abra Stone and Rose The Hat. Both pull off each other well even though they're both from opposite sides of the spectrum. Honestly, i hope i get to see the two in more movies.In addition, it also does an excellent job in both adapting and pleasing the fans of Kubrick. Although yes, King himself despised it however it has to be taken account that numerous said otherwise going as far to say that it's a magnificent piece of modern horror.
Furthermore, they also did an excellent job in presenting its nostalgia overload nearing its finale. My god, everything seems all so in place when you see it and yes, like it or hate it, it also affects the story as it does not entirely follow it source material at times.Anyways, those were the highs, and now on to the lows. It's simple, the problem lies with its characters, why you ask? 🤔
Well there are certain decisions or actions a character take that could've been improved upon. However, whether audiences and critics like it or hate it, it is an inevitable trope that has been in a great amount of horrors and thrillers which comes to my ultimate conclusion. Doctor Sleep is a great sequel to an all time classic and deserves to be looked, and frankly i prefer this than its predecessor.Also, just a small note, i'm pretty sure the movie was extremely tough to make for the director because he has to adapt two people's work and still has to successfully make it into a cohesive and understanding narrative. He makes everyone seem so human and that is what makes it horrifying. It inserts a sense of dread in viewers because it does not pull any punches. It is riveting as it is realistic, it's the best way to describe its tone.Hence why i choose to rate this film at a pretty high score, thank you for listening and please see the movie if you have not. You certainly won't be disappointed in this faithful adaption 🌟",Doctor Sleep

I mean, do you same geriatric critics who swear by ""The Shining"" of 1980, think that ""The Mummy's Hand"" from 1940 is great just because it's old? Sure, it's a classic because it was great to the people in that era. But by today's standards, and the standards of 1980, ""The Mummy's Hand"" from 1940 sucks! Similarly, you won't find too many people younger than 40 who think ""The Shining"" is that good. It's only you elderly folks with your nostalgic mindsets that believe so. ""The Shining"" is just a crazed man chasing his family around an empty hotel with an ax. The only things that makes ""The Shining"" more than a simple ""slasher"" movie are the hints of supernatural aspects that leave the viewer to question if there really are ghosts in the hotel, or if the characters in the movie are simply psychotic and experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. ""The Shining"" doesn't even make sense unless you watch this movie after. ""The Shining"" is just another ""slasher"" movie with a few ghost scenes at best, without this movie redefining it, and giving viewers a deeper meaning to the story. ""Doctor Sleep"" is the perfect sequel for ""The Shining,"" because the evolution of the storyline, coincides with the evolution of our time. ""Doctor Sleep"" picks up right where ""The Shining"" left off, and then gives the painful past experiences of the little boy ""Dan,"" real justification many years later. The viewer comes to realize that Dan's childhood horrors and tragedies prepared him for his role in life as a man years later, as he helps other ""shining"" children escape those who prey on them, torment them, and kill them.

1154,karstenschmieder,Must-see performances in a solid Horror debased by too much nostalgia,8,18 December 2020,"Doctor Sleep is the 2019 adaptation of Stephen King's follow-up to the legendary novel The Shining which itself was turned into a landmark horror by Stanley Kubrick in 1980 - a film that is seen by many as the quintessential Horror Movie. So does Doctor Sleep come close to the inventiveness and quality of the original The Shining? Does it even matter? Yes and no.This film really angers me. It angers me because it is a competent Horror with fantastic performances, serious suspense and a tight script that leaves just enough room for the actors to breathe. Why is that angering? Because when you have such a great overall package, you dont need that extra bit of crowd-pleasing shoved down your throat. There are constant visual references throughout the movie, reminding us at every step that we are not only watching a gripping tale of Horror, no, we are watching the actual sequel to this iconic movie, from which you bought a t-shirt once and that you see on each Top-Whatever-List on Youtube. Seriously, there is nothing wrong with nostalgia and me personally, I too love The Shining, but damn, let those movies do their own thing. The ending (which was changed from the book) takes one step too far and basically shows us the original film on a meta level which actually made me downgrade Doctor Sleep. I know that many viewers enjoyed those throwbacks and while they were decent on a technical level, they never worked for me.Now that I have that out of my system, I can tell you about Rebecca Ferguson. Ferguson plays Rose The Hat, the leader of the villainous cult The True Knot and she single-handedly lifts Doctor Sleep from good to great with her cunning and magnetic performance. The story of The True Knot is the most fascinating part of the novel and director Mike Flanagan makes the right choice to give them enough room (I watched the Directors Cut) and show them as evil, yes, but also as people who are always forced to hunt, always on the edge of survival themselves. You really despise those people, but you are drawn to them, too. I also applaud the decision to cast lauded actor Jacob Tremblay in a cameo for the books most notorious scene that was adapted every bit as intense as it reads on the written page.So while those scenes work the best, there are also good things to say about our actual protagonists. While I struggled to see how exactly Ewan McGregors Danny Torrance earns the nickname Doctor Sleep, his performance is competent and likeable. The movie is just not that interested in his character. Kyliegh Currans Abra is engaging and her chemistry with McGregor and Ferguson is what lifts the second half of the movie. Her scenes of mind control and floating could have easily come across as laughable, but her earnestness makes them work.All in all, Doctor Sleep is very enjoyable. While the nostalgia overflow and Jump-Scare-factor are a bit high for my taste, the performances more than make up for those flaws. Mike Flanagan manages to sew together a sprawling story, applying his glossy visual touch to great effect and leaves us with one of the best Stephen King-adaptations in recent years.",Doctor Sleep

I'm sure there's an internet site that contains the count of the children's ages 5-14 graphic and detailed death.So it's a well known fact he hated the film version of ""The Shining"" and my guess is the only way he wouldn't publicly crap on this film, Doctor Sleep, is if they included the graphic death of the group of life suckers brutally murdering the little boy they kidnapped with the sole purpose of killing him. The filmmakers could have implied his death like they did with the first girl at the start.I'll admit is was so disturbing that it added to the evil and terror behind the motivation of the group to find the shining people. It doesn't help that the kid murdered is a fantastic actor and was absolutely amazing.Outside of that this movie was perfect!

First of all, to create a sequel to ""The Shining""is a foolish proposition and one cannot compare this pretentious dross to the original masterpiece.
Secondly, will someone please tell me why Rebecca Ferguson is so acclaimed as an actress when her performance is so mannered, her lines whispered like a wet fairy princess, like so many other members of the cast? This seems to be the new norm, breathlessly mutter a line of script and everyone assumes your acting is so wonderful.
Thirdly, at the first sign of CGI(breathing effects), you know you're watching the beginnings of a stinker.
Nobody today can match the meticulousness of Kubrick, whether they are trying to or not. There isn't one actor who is the equal of anyone from the original so please don't reshoot scenes from ""The Shining"" with different actors..........just don't bother.
It disturbs me that American cinema is still pushing out this type of film on a regular basis. Make it confusing, add an air of mystery or danger but for good ness sake, do it well.
I would couple this movie with Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" as a big insult to your average but intelligent movie-goer.

What a mistake that would have been. Yes, Kubrick would probably hate it, but for many fans of the original this is a very special quasi-sequel.While the main part of the new plot is hardly very original, it is the attention to detail in the sequences linking back to the first movie that will blow fans of that film away. From the re-created shots of a young Danny cycling around the halls of the Overlook, through to the older Danny making his way back through the modern wreck, and everything in between, the attention to detail by the film's art design team is exceptional.Personally I think anyone contemplating watching this film should see the original before viewing Doctor Sleep, as it will make much more sense when viewed in context, but overall I rate it very highly as sequels go.",Doctor Sleep

1177,dpacker207,WB Sequel Series Coming Soon?,3,2 July 2020,"I'm not going to bore you by telling you the synopsis of the movie. And while I believe myself to be a good judge of movies, this is just my opinion. This movie could've easily been a TV pilot on the WB, except for the one gory scene in which a child is brutally tortured and killed. Personally, I don't like gore, especially involving children, but I understand that horror movies have to have some gore or it's not a Horror movie. However, since the rest of the movie is so mild, why throw torture into the murder scene? Maybe to get it labeled Horror, along with the labels of Fantasy, Drama, and Thriller? Without that one scene this should have been labeled as a Fantasy/Drama because it's not thrilling at all. By the way, I'm not comparing this Doctor Sleep to The Shining because that's in a league of it's own. Here, the evil people look like circus performers and are not in the least bit scary. Speaking about them, Dan (the main character) said that they were ""rich and connected"". Hearing this I laughed out loud! They were just a small group of loners that traveled around in old RVs! RICH & POWERFUL?! LOL!
I hate loose ends, and this movie had some stupid one's. The stupidest one is the black top hat. It was implied that it held some mysterious power but it came to nothing. Ugh! Now about the acting. I couldn't muster any empathy, or sympathy, for any of the characters, or their relationships to one another, because they weren't believable. In fact, Violet calling Dan ""Uncle Dan"" throughout the entire movie was more annoying than fingernails on a chalkboard! Regrettably, I continue to endure this corny movie, not because I thought it was going to get better, but because I'm stubborn and just had to see it all the way to the (sequel implied)lackluster ending. When it finally did end I thought to myself, ""What a waste of time"". Now that I've written all this negative stuff I need to say this; The fault for this bland movie has to lie with the writing and directing of it because I've seen some of these actors in other performances and really liked them. The premise of this movie was good, the execution of it was not.

1185,Bsandergaard,Great.. But would have benefited without Kubrick's adaptation.,8,9 November 2019,"Whether you prefer Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" or Stephen King's ""The Shining"" and ""Doctor Sleep"" books, you leave feeling a bit disappointed. King fans will leave sad that they got a film full of inconsistencies and a completely different ending. While Kubrick fans will leave disappointed that they got only 20 minutes of fan service to the masterpiece of a film. Because of Kubrick's choice to change his adaption drastically and flip the story on its head, he made it extremely hard to continue the series flawlessly. His choices caused a divide that makes it hard for the future big screen sequels to please the complete fanbase. The fight between Kubrick fans and King fans has been rampant since 1980. I prefer Kubrick's Shining film over the Shining book written by King, but the film really did this Doctor Sleep film dirty. Doctor Sleep as a film on it's own was pretty good. The acting from Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson and Kyliegh Curran was the stand out element of the film. They gave their all and it ""shines"" during the whole duration of the film. The Directing, Cinematography, and Editing was done really well, thanks to Mike Flanagan. He has proved himself as a talented director/editor in the past, and this film continues that streak in those territories. The writing felt natural and flowed throughout the film. The place where this film fails though, is when they try to please both fans of the Kubrick film and the fans of Stephen King's two novels. The two sides of the metaphorical coin are so different, that trying to satisfy both sides is impossible. Fans of the Kubrick film leave Doctor Sleep wishing the film had more than just 20 minutes in the Overlook Hotel. Fans of the two Stephen King novels on the other hand wish that Doctor Sleep was was more faithful to the Doctor Sleep book. They leave hating the inconsistencies and the completely different ending. Doctor Sleep on its own as a psychological thriller is a super strong film, but as an adaption the film falls flat. Because of Kubrick's choices in 1980, this film could never fully please the entire ""Shining"" fanbase completely. As a stand alone film, ""Doctor Sleep"" is pretty well made. As an adaption on the other hand, this film lacks heavily. This film is pretty good on it's own, but if the adaption side was way stronger, this film would have been a masterpiece.",Doctor Sleep

So...this movie is very well done, but there are a handful of things that do disservice to the original. For one, the recasting of original cast members for scenes is ridiculous and immediately pull you out of the movie. I get the cast is old / dead but none of the scenes actually needed to be in the film. The decision to not use old footage or  of / Jack Nicholson was also a mistake. The misuses of the overlook and the spirits within is also a misstep. My last big issue is the lack of world building, they throw a large number of new abilities and situations revolving around those who ""shine"" but theres no explanation as to what is what and how they function. There are a few scenes that come out of left field and you are just left to scratch your head and try to piece the situation together yourself.That said the movie is paced very well, slow burn that builds all the way to the last 20 min or so then kinda stumbles over into the original film for no reason. The shinings shadow must be larger than i thought.

There were no character. No one was acting. The costume and set designs that weren't cribbed directly from another film were boring. The plot was directionless and bad. At points you just watched worse actors reenact shot for shot reshoots of the shining. Why would anyone think this is a good idea? There was no atmosphere, no rising tension. The entire first hour of the movie didn't have anything to do with what the plot was. That being said the plot was so messy it didn't really matter. The last scenes were just watching people in Halloween costumes of shining characters show up and say their iconic lines and then leave.

1203,tjwb84,A great story well told. And a little bit of pandering to sit through.,8,12 November 2019,"When I first read that Stephen King was writing a sequel to The Shining, my instincts said it was probably a bad idea. Happily, sometimes my instincts suck. I thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep. The book had me hooked with excellent characters and a small-scale narrative that actually had little to do with the events in The Shining, and certainly didn't pander to the reader in the way Hollywood loves to do (see South Park's ""Memberberries"" for more on that). I admire the way in which King handled this difficult sequel.I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this movie as well, and highly recommend it. It is mostly true to the book, the acting is great, and the pandering is confined to the ending (the least impressive part, more on that later).The characters seemed as true to the book as should be expected. In particular, I thought Rose, Abra, Crow Daddy, and Danny Torrance were all bloody fantastic. Rose is an interesting character, presented in great yet mysterious detail in the book, and not easy to bring to life. But for me Rebecca Ferguson was flawless. Ewan McGregor makes for an excellent, likable-but-flawed Danny Torrance, and in one particular shot, I thought he channeled Jack Nicholson's acting very effectively, a startling moment.The movie contains some beautiful and haunting shots. Two highlights for me were Rose flying through the sky, looking for steam, and a certain shot of Grandpa Flick savoring the steam he's just consumed, looking like something out of Bloodborne. (The only thing I really missed was Rose's one-toothed face! Wish they had included that.) The Baseball Boy's torture scene was incredibly gruesome and hard to watch - but that, of course, is precisely its intended effect.The score is effective, frequently using the 'heartbeat' effect from Kubrick's The Shining, which produces an instant atmosphere of tension.
Now, in my opinion, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a masterpiece of art, and in my experience, no modern film comes close to the quality of its shots, audio, or filmcraft, including this one. But that doesn't mean that Doctor Sleep's cinematography and soundtrack aren't excellent in their own right.There are some interesting differences and similarities among the two books and films. Doctor Sleep (the movie) omits some interesting aspects of the book, such as Danny's sponsor and the love affair between Rose and Snakebite Andy. But that probably makes sense in terms of the screenplay.
More crucially, in the films' universe, The Overlook was never destroyed, thus giving the movie adaptation of Doctor Sleep the opportunity to.... Go back to the hotel.This takes us to the ending, which is the film's weakest part (the same is probably also true for the book). Going back to the Overlook and touring its key locations did nothing for me, and at that point I began to feel the movie's considerable length.But at that point I was already a satisfied customer. I got to see an excellent novel brought to life in an excellent way. Go check it out.",Doctor Sleep

But, if you are bored and can get through the first half you may like it.",Doctor Sleep
1206,lcastellan-34438,"""mAyBe iT's nEtFLix oR sOmEtHing""",1,9 November 2019,"Oh yes, you got that right, mr. Movie!Maybe it is Netflix's fault that this movie is rated so high, I mean, with the amount of garbage we are used to watching nowadays, it is natural that a movie like this has a very high rating. Or, you know, maybe Netflix proves a point that you can make big bucks producing mediocre and below average content, where horror equals to shock value and the story can have as many plot holes as you like, because, hey, here's a couple of ghosts getting shot in the head. Don't think too much, it could ruin the experience.As for the baddies in this movie: ""They are not people...they are not humans"" and 20 minutes later we get a scene of a couple of main characters simply UNLOADING on a bunch of the so-called ""entities""... PRETTY SCARY, RIGHT? I mean, how could these...ahem...entities...have survived for so many DECADES? No one thought of blasting one of them with a goddamn rifle or something, at one point in time, during so many years? I mean, it would be SO easy, right? Also, imagine if in the middle of The Shining, Jack's wife got an Ak-47 and started blasting through all the Overlook Hotel's ghosts. Pretty HORRIFYING if you ask me. The TENSION would be going through the roof!
I'm sorry for being so harshly ironic with this, but my God, during this scene I couldn't help myself but thinking that I was watching a mock live action version of Grand Theft Auto called GTA: Ghost Edition.Oh, and HOW IN THE NAME OF JACK TORRANCE are we not supposed to compare this movie with the previous one, if not only your ENTIRE FINAL ACT takes place in Overlook Hotel but you also MAKE SURE TO IMITATE EVERY SINGLE MAJOR SCARE FROM THE SHINING, like a goddamn Disney Ride (as very well pointed out by another reviewer).And another thing. Overlook Hotel's entities were trapped inside Danny's mind, so when they are released from his mind they go back to the real world?! I mean what the hell, this doesn't make sense at all. ""OH but in The Shining Jack Torrance was shown in a photo taken in the twenties and that doesn't make sense too"" well yeah, but that was more like an open ending than anything else, it makes you wonder if Jack was a ghost all along, and it adds up to the mystery. It's like when we ask ourselves if SPOILER ALERT FOR BLADE RUNNER Deckard was a replicant all along in the first Blade Runner movie.In the previous movie, the horror was very organic to the movie. It manifested itself very naturally, and we got a very strong sensation of dread and anxiety throughout the entire film. The helplessness of the characters facing this unstoppable and somewhat unknown menace manifesting itself through ghosts was very discomforting and therefore it was very effective as a horror movie. In Doctor Sleep, however, we have an ultra-powered shining child, so we never really get a sense that the good guys are actually in danger, which therefore doesn't trigger this feeling of dread/anxiety, so it didn't work for me as a horror movie. It was more like an action/adventure/fantasy movie.Oh, and the child killing scene was very gratuitous. You don't need the ultra shock value to make the audience scared. In fact, we don't get scared, we get disgusted. Those are completely different feelings. I guess the director didn't care much for that. He should watch The Shining to get to know what true horror is all about. Oh, but he watched it, right? I mean, the final act clearly confirms that. So I don't know what happened. Maybe it's Netflix or something.",Doctor Sleep

The climax does feel a bit tagged on for me and makes the film feel as though it has 4 acts. But all around the final act is very entertaining. ( Especially for the shining movie & book fans)But overall I found the story engaging, Rebecca ferguson gives a performance as rose the hat and is the stand out but the preformances all around were solid.
Not a movie to go to if your looking to get scared but there are many very disturbing scenes.Its worth a see, especially for the shining fans",Doctor Sleep
1218,xamiell,Always look at the big picture.,9,26 August 2020,"When judging the film, the script, the story and its development, the performances and the CGI must be kept in mind. There is always a sin, nothing is perfect.The script was solid, the dialogues, the natural confusion about the term ""the shining"" where some say ""steam"" and others say ""magic"" that is something very realistic since none of the characters has a connection with the others until a time to convey that idea. Each of the facets of the characters and how much it is necessary to know about them.The story went well. To be able to talk about the story, you must first understand that it is not a superhero movie, it is not powers that the characters have but supernatural abilities that are at the metaphysical level of the soul, so you have to keep that in mind. You have to do a little research to understand what the story is about. In the story of The Shinning movie, Danny has this ability so, aren't there more children with this ability? We even see that in The Shinning movie that Dick Hallorann also has these abilities because it is a strong connection with the supernatural world that some people have, so that's where those spirits that consume said ability come in.The performances were neither exaggerated nor overrated. Good performances from Ewan McGregor, Kyliegh Curran, Rebecca Ferguson and the entire cast. Very fine-tuned performances, like the scene of Jacob Tremblay being consumed or the scenes in which Rose is afraid of Abra.Very good CGI, the astral travel scene was very good and how the houses turn was out of the box. Very goodTo look at the great image of this movie is to be aware that in this modern era this movie brings something new where most horror movies have become clichés such as: there is always a curse, there are always mystical symbols, there is always revenge from someone evil spirit, etc. In this movie despite touching the supernatural there are no symbols, there is no such curse or some vengeful spirit, etc. This is good.",Doctor Sleep

Ewan McGregor is great as Dan Torrance, conveying the guilt, regret, and shame that should've been his father's.
Jack Torrance is The Shining epitomized. Cold. Unfeeling. Almost not even human. His son, Dan, is Doctor Sleep. Compassionate. Hopeful. In this way, Doctor Sleep compliments The Shining, as when the two films are out together they show humanity at its best and worst.
Kyleigh Curran is amazing as Abra, giving the audience a smart, level headed heroine to root for.

The original Shining was brilliant, and the creators of this movie had a chance to do something spectacular. I should have known that sequels are usually bad, and this was no exception! Kubrick's genius in the original was in the quiet moments and what _wasn't_ said and what _wasn't_ explained. This was a cheap-looking monster movie with a monsters that weren't frightening, a few low-grade special effects and no scares - at all. Jack Nicholson was terrifying in the original. Sorry, but Rose the Hat wasn't even remotely creepy!This played like a bad made-for-TV movie that ran for over 2 hours. I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt knowing that it wasn't supposed to be like the original. However, this is the second time (the other being Quentin Tarantino's recent time-waster) recently that I left to go to the toilet and found myself thinking ""when is this going to end?"". I got my hopes up when they finally went back to the Overlook and I thought ...maybe... there will be some real scares. Nope.. Just flashbacks to the original great movie that left me wishing for more. I had to watch to the end so that I could give an honest review, but the end was no better than the rest of this.

1228,rexytherexdude,"A worthy sequel, adaptation, and film.",9,5 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep is a 2019 horror film directed by Mike Flanagan, is an adaptation of Stephen King's 2013 novel of the same name, and the film stars Ewan McGregor as Danny Torrance, Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat, and Kyliegh Curran as Abra Stone, plus many more fantastic actors/actresses portraying fantastic characters. Years following the events of The Shining, Dan Torrance, now in his 40s, is a struggling alcoholic who moves to a new town and receives the help he needs. Meanwhile a group of quasi-immortals known as The True Knot travel across the states in search of those who shine, then torture them for their steam, which gives them sustenance, like a drug or alcoholic drink. When the leader of the group, Rose the Hat, learns of Abra's immense power, she begins the hunt for the girl, while Abra herself contacts Dan for his help. Though in the town he lives in, he works at a hospice, and there he uses his abilities to comfort patients in their last moments, which he eventually gets the nickname, ""Doctor Sleep"", hence the title of the novel and the film. Meanwhile in Dan's mind, the spirits which had loomed at the Overlook hotel are now trapped in lockboxes he formed after learning how to by Dick Holloran. In a thrilling set of events, Dan protects Abra from The True Knot until the third act when he faces Rose the Hat. Mike Flanagan continues to show his skills as a horror movie director, as he relies on suspense and tension rather than constant, in-your-face jumpscares that a lot of horror films tend to have within the past few years. While Doctor Sleep does have a couple jumpscares, the film was not plagued with them, and the jumpscares themselves worked really well to the film's advantage. Doctor Sleep is a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of The Shining, and thus story elements in the film are different compared to the novel, but director Mike Flanagan makes it work with his expert storytelling skills. The actors within the film are very fantastic, and they do their best with the excellent script they were given. Rebecca Ferguson especially stands out as Rose the Hat, because while she isn't a terrifying villain, she can be very intimidating, and even disturbing at times, which was expected since the character was the same way in the book. While the rest of the actors or actresses are excellent in the film, Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson and Kyliegh Curran are the best in the film, and it works to the film's advantage as they are the stars of it. The film itself is paced very well, and has amazing cinematography, using large camera lenses that Stanley Kubrick did for The Shining, especially when Dan Torrance attacks Rose the Hat with the axe that Jack had once tried to kill Dan and his mother Wendy with all those years ago. Now for the soundtrack, The Newton Brothers bring a sense of heavy weight and uneasiness with their composition, and what adds to that effect is the sound effect of heartbeats. This works very well to the film's advantage of being a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's film since the soundtrack for that film had a weight of uneasiness and tension to it, which filled the films with serious tension and uneasiness, and even terrifying. Now as for Doctor Sleep itself, the film also works as a standalone film, because even if you haven't seen The Shining, Doctor Sleep reminds you of the horrific events which took place at the Overlook hotel. Obviously since it is a sequel to that film, Doctor Sleep has fan service for those who have seen The Shining. Though the way it works is that the film establishes its story in an intriguing, compelling way before delivering fan service, which came in the form of the classic theme from The Shining, which played when Dan took Abra to the Overlook hotel for the final showdown with Rose the Hat. A couple characters from the first film return, as we see Wendy Torrance in the film, along with Jack in a couple scenes. The biggest surprise was seeing Dick Holloran, because seeing as he had been killed by Jack in the first film, he comes back in the form of a ghost for Danny to talk to, who gives him advice and somewhat helps him on his journey throughout the film, only when it's important though. Given that Dick is mostly important to Danny, his presence in the film does not plague or slow the plot, as he shows up when it's most important. Now as for being an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, it works really well as an adaption and a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's film, and the film has as an advantage is that King himself is a producer for it. Though one surprise to me in the film were the elements it used from The Shining novel. A good example of this is that in the novel, the hotel had burned down and was later turned into a campground owned by The True Knot, and that the film ends with Danny burning down the hotel so that Abra can escape and live safely without the dark secrets of the hotel plaguing Abra as she lives her life. Overall, the film was very well directed, acted, shot and composed, and it is definitely the best film of 2019. Is it worth the watch? Yes, yes it is. My score for it is 9/10.",Doctor Sleep

Even with this film being a mix of an adaptation and sequel to the Stephen King's Doctor Sleep and The Shining Novels as well as a sequel to Kubrick's ""The Shining"" 1980 film, it's still a better film adaptation of Stephen King's book ""Doctor Sleep"" than Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is to Stephen King's The Shining Novel (which I find better than Kubrick's film in pretty much every way), and rather easily as well. I find Kubrick's The Shining to be one of the most overrated films of all time and a terrible adaptation to the book, not very scary at all, and very worthy of it's Razzle Nominations in 1980. This has been a year full of decent to good Stephen King movie adaptations but Doctor Sleep is the best one of the year, without a doubt. Doctor Sleep is actually one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made and the best since The Green Mile in 1999..20 years ago. The Shawshank Redemption still being the best though, in my opinion. Doctor Sleep is a great film. Definitely worth a watch or two in the cinemas.",Doctor Sleep

1237,tompence,"A strange blend of King and Kubric, that ultimately works",8,8 November 2019,"Having been a fan of Kubrics interpretation of The Shining, I was immediately cautiously optimistic when I heard they would be making a sort of sequel. After an average trailer, I expected very little of the film to deliver. I was in for a shock.The films main protagonist is Danny Torrence, a now morally grey, depressed alcoholic. It could have so easily come across as a cliche, but the writing really nails how the literal demons in Jack's life are what drove him to this state. A scene towards the end of the film set in the hotels bar, is extremely powerful, as we see Danny confront his inner demons, which in this case are his father's influence over him as well as his alcoholism. Danny's story in this film is poignant, and was most certainly the highlight of the film for me. You can tell the creators really wanted to give him a satisfying redemption arc.The new elements of the film are where things were a bit less strong. The villainess, Rose the hat, was fantastic, and was portrayed with an enticing, evil energy. The same could be said for all the newcomers, performances were generally strong across the board. However, the film falters when it loses focus on Danny. The antagonists themselves arent very interesting, and the fact that the new girl is shown to be so powerful really eases the tension, as you can ultimately tell she will end up completely unscathed (she almost beats Rose in their first fight?!). However, I feel as though no villain introduced would be able to beat the Overlook Hotel, so at the very least we got some good performances.A couple of side notes. The soundtrack was fantastic, if not sounding a little too similar to the original film.
Some of the visuals were incredible and creative, especially during shining sequences.
I have no issue with them recreating scenes from the original. It wouldnt work reusing old footage and mishmashing it with new ones.Overall, I'm happy with how the film turned out. You could tell passion for the source material and Kubrics vision were poured into this film, and the result is a worthy successor to the shining and a faithful adaptation to the novel.",Doctor Sleep

The film's first act is arguably the best act of the film. I thought some parts in the film it lost it's tempo in the second act, but the nostalgic third act got my attention again, the overlook in this movie has been painfully recreated to a T. And the overlook felt scarier than ever, it really felt like a old reunion with a place we always wanted to visit again. Acting in this film was really good, Ewan McGregor as Danny Torrance was a match made in heaven, he really nails this part. You genuinely believe this is the same person who had those gruesome experience's in the 1980 shinning. The young girl Abra was a scene stealer, she really was fantastic In this role, she's a character the audience rooted for. She somehow makes the audience have an attachment with her. And last of all the villain rose played by Rebecca Ferguson, was a satisfying villain and a character you grow to hate. My biggest plus the soundtrack and the suspense is nailed in this movie, there truly is some great scares, intense heartbeats very Similar to those in Kubrick's masterpiece.

McGregor's character was acted well.The idea of this being a sequel to The Shining is more marketing then truth.

1246,rickinthenorthguitar,"Schizophrenic due to conflicting sources, but ultimately satisfying",7,31 January 2020,"Doctor Sleep as a novel is not one of my favourite King books, so I had my reservations about this film adaptation but a lot of that was assuaged by the director, who is an affirmed King fan and GETS a lot of King's work better than several other adaptorsThe film has a challenge right from the start, which is trying to link both to Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Stephen King's novel ""The Shining"" - two stories which, whilst obviously sharing setting and basic plot, are massively different in their character execution and general themes. Kubrick's The Shining is undoubtedly a masterpiece of film making, but it's not a good adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Shining"" - which leaves ""Doctor Sleep"" in a precarious position, trying to draw on emotional connections between the deceased Jack Torrance and Danny that just aren't present in Kubrick's film.It's further challenged by the public's assumption that it will be a horror. I maintain that Stephen King isn't a horror writer - he's a fantasy writer and character builder whose characters often undergo horrific things. Again, with this loss of character development in Kubrick's film and the emphasis on tension and terror, this being marketed as a direct sequel was a massive mistake, given that it's basically a sci-fi / fantasy flick with a few horrific momentsBUT. All that aside, I think Doctor Sleep handles the content very well. There are some fantastic sequences that perfectly encapsulate King's hyper-metaphorical style in a way that I haven't seen done to such great effect before (rummaging through the drawers is a particular highlight). And whilst the ending differs massively from the book, it nearly brought me to tears in the way it tried to do justice to the ending of ""The Shining"" - the book - which never made it to the screen.I can see why people who've only experienced the film of The Shining would find this a lacklustre sequel. Aside from the penultimate 10 minutes (which just tries to tour all of the buzz-spots from Kubrick's film) it references King's book far more than Kubrick's film, and this is going to be confusing and disconnecting for people not familiar with the source material. But as an avid fan of the film and the book of the Shining - and NOT a massive fan of the book ""Doctor Sleep"" - I thought it was done very, very well.",Doctor Sleep

I cannot even imagine the pressure Mike Flannigan was under while shooting this thing. In my mind, he did a great job directing this movie, while it may not be perfect it is pretty damn good. There are certain points of the movie feels more like a superhero movie than a horror movie, particularly near the end. That part, I don't like, but the rest of the movie is pretty good.

It's very difficult to portray on film the imagination that Stephen King so effortlessly displays in his novels, yet Mike Flanagan brings this film to life on screen in a way I think both Kubrick and King would be proud of.
Brilliant performances from the young cast and fantastic acting from the main protagonists.

Though it doesn't capture the same 'cabin fever-ish' vibe from the original, it's a great sequel that successfully manages to picture the shining universe as a whole, as well as having some great callbacks to the first movie and pretty great acting. As for the cons, the movie sometimes does get a bit repetitive and has a couple side plots that didn't really have any direction. Overall, though, that didn't really distract me or pull me out of the movie in any way.

For a fan of the original Kubrick classic this movie falls apart at the end very fast. The Shining had an incredibly slow build up that would lead into the nail biting horror atmosphere that is the second and third acts. However while this new film keeps most of the originals slow dragged out plot building elements that results in a nearly three hour run time, it lands on a laughably bad ending sequence that recreates the finale of the original film. The horror elements are very few and far between, and the reuse of the lady in the bathtub at the end put the final nail in the coffin. As a standalone superhero film it's a very solid movie, but as a sequel to one of the greatest horror films ever made it's incredibly disappointing.",Doctor Sleep

I watched the 1980 Shining right before this and it's one if my all time favorite movies, but this literally has nothing to do with any if that and it's a little weird that it tries too.There are things I don't hate. Everyone's acting is fine and if it was a stand alone movie, it'd be ok. It's an uncomfortable blend of brutally harsh and teenie bop. It reminds me a lot of the recent Sabrina series on Netflix. It's not psychological at all like the other movie, there's no intense build up. Its trying to be edgy without being edgy. But I love Ewan McGregor and like I said everyone's acting was good. The storyline just doesn't make sense at all to me, sequal or not. I don't regret those 3 hours of my life, but won't revisit them either.",Doctor Sleep

1274,furious_olive,Wut.,5,3 March 2020,"Wow. I don't know what happened here. I read the book and was very curious about the film. I wondered if it would be possible to translate such an extensive story into film. Conclusion: it failed. Not miserably, but still. I understand very well that details are lost in converting to film. I also understand that things are being adjusted to make the story logical for film. What I don't understand is that things are being invented that have not happened in the book and that I believe are totally unnecessary. The word ""wut?"" Has come out of my mouth several times while watching.The film starts just fine. It's all a bit boring, but okay, some things have to be explained. The middle part suddenly passes, which had me wondering what the hell is happening and why. The end is (besides that it is completely different than the book) unnecessary, frayed and it is made very easy for Dan and Abra.I miss a lot in the film. I miss character. I miss main characters from the book. I miss an explanation, it all makes no sense. You don't really build a ""relationship"" with the characters. In the book you will even sympathize a little with the True Knot, however strange. You just don't care that the main characters die (which they don't do in the book).In addition: Kyliegh Curran, the girl who plays Abra has so little facial expression, that during the film it seems as if she is constantly bored or that she simply does not care. Even the unnecessary death of her father made up by Mike Flanagan seems to have zero impact on her.Stephen King says Mike Flanagan has made a number of adjustments to the film that he believes work. I do not agree with that.Just read the book, that's a much better story than the film. Or watch the film and do not read the book. But don't do both, because then you will be annoyed.",Doctor Sleep
1275,e-man1996,Disappointed,6,19 December 2019,"The entire support for the 1980 ""The Shinning"" was the fact that the house being haunted, made it a cat and mouse thrilling escape adventure, for Danny and his mother to escape, a mother protecting her child from her husband is the peak of human emotion and an incredibly interesting scenario. Yet this film somehow takes out the cat and mouse, replaces it with a cat and cat. It turns a psycological thriller into an X-Men action movie.A lot of the scenes were just incredibly done, Rose Astro-Traveling. The back and forth spiritual battle between Abra and Rose. The dream battle of Abra was so incredibly memorable it was so well done. But other than a few more scenes from the movie, everything felt flat and bland. Missing the purpose of the storyline.It had the direction of a great psycho thriller movie, but I feel most of my personal issues with the movie came from the writing, as it focused completely on Abra and her brawl with Rose, not Danny and his mental struggles and psychological trauma of the Shinning.The movie could've been an incredible blend of The Joker, The sixth sense and the Shinning all packed together in the focus of Danny. But instead a quarter way through it turned into a superhero movie with a generic bad guy.
Here's my rant:What happened to the baseball kid? Was he found at all after they dug him up?
No one gave a damn about him as soon as they got the baseball gloveWhat was the purpose of Rose inhaling all those canisters? From that point she literally used 0% of her powers, instead she brawled Danny in hand to hand disarming him down the stairs.What could've been for a mental mind game against Danny:Danny walks into the hotel and all he hears are the loud presses of a typewriter, and he gets to the hall and he sees the back of Jack his father typing as it slowly pans in. Jack stops typing when he hears Danny enter and slowly stands up.*Jack Nicholson voice*""Danny, how long has it bin (been)? You and your b*** mother never cease to PES-ter me like a leach in my ear cannal, I've said it once to your mother, and I'll say it again to you!.""*Jack picks up his type writer and throws it smashing it to bits*""I TOLD YOU NOT TO BOTHER ME WHILE I WORK!""Honestly it would've been better if the powerful girl Abra was fighting Rose in a mental mind game, while Danny was trying to resist the hotel and trying to survive, resisting his father who now lives in the hotel as apart of it, running through the halls. Resisting using sheer will! Flashing back to him as a kid.
He could've had nostalgic cutbacks to his mother earlier on, then end with Jack cutting through the boiler room door and Danny crying while looking at Jack as the place burns down and he turns to see his mother as it was in the end. (So Bittersweet)Why tf couldn't they add in Jack Nicholsons voice? Or add him in and use CGI to make him younger? ( No one would care if it didn't work well they want Jack Nicholson)",Doctor Sleep

The connection to the base film is so louse it would make more sense not to bind them at all. Definitely it would not worsen the film. Moreover, it seems that the movie follows the King's crappy books rather than the excellent Kubrick's movie.What else has left me wondering is the question if it at all necessary to depicture the torturing and killing of a 10 yo boy.

It's ultimately a story of replicas, of things (and people, and places, and emotions) that aren't what they seem-a description that very much applies to the movie itself.

GOOD: the fact that it is a sequel to ""The Shining"", music, visual impression, performances by Rebecca Ferguson and Jacob Tremblay
NOT GOOD: other acting performances, illogical or implausible narrative, too long, no scares, predictive, very poor psychological and social characterization, abnormal emotional responses by the characters, abundance of Hollywood blockbuster narrative patterns",Doctor Sleep
1305,marmitejim,Do you not know when you are watching something that is sick?,1,19 March 2020,"Just saw the scene in this movie where the young boy gets tortured. Its very well acted (by him anyway), very graphic and if you are a relatively normal person its quite disturbing.Thing is though that this breaks the rules for horror movies; horror is entertainment and fantasy. It might be legitimate (not sure in what instance but it might be) to show child torture if it were a true story and you needed to make a point but in a horror story what is the point and what is the motive?Why would anyone want to see a child getting tortured? What would be the reason for that?So I wonder why Stephen King endorsed the film - what is he trying to achieve by writing scenes like this?Apparently the director Mike Flanagan, in an interview admitted he knew the scene was disturbing and yet put it in the film anyway. Apparently the actors were disturbed by it, some brought to tears. What was he trying to achieve?Why are good actors like Ewan Mcgregor and Rebecca Ferguson doing in a film with a scene like this in it? Are they not ashamed to be associated with it?Why have over 85,000 users given this film a high rating of 7.4 when its got a scene like this in it? Do you all like watching child torture?Its a fantasy horror film - what are you enjoying by watching this?

It's ok as a movie even if one has not seen The Shining or did not know this was a Sequel, but there is one scene that for me crosses the line - the graphic torture and killiing of a child. If this were a cat or a dog would it be allowed? I doubt it but somehow this was deemed OK? It was sickening to watch and as you may no there are some things that you can't unsee.

1312,mudblood477,One of the Very Best King Adaptations.,8,14 November 2019,"I had virtually no expectations coming into this film. Doctor Sleep is one of King's books that I haven't read and The Shining is a pretty substantial film to try to follow after 40 years. It seemed like an ill-advised late sequel. Boy was I wrong. You know that feeling of genuine surprise and delight when you realize you're watching something great for the first time? I got that feeling about twenty or so minutes into this film.Though it takes some setup to really find its footing, methodically setting all of the various pieces in motion. Once it gets going it grabs you and doesn't let go until the end.Mike Flanagan absolutely killed it with this sequel to one of the horrors most beloved films. His film is not only respectful of what came before but it's actively reflecting on the themes of that film and carrying them through to this one.I should say that this is in no way a horror film in the same way The Shining is, there are scares here and there and they are very well done but this isn't a film that's trying to creep you out at every turn. The film is more interested in exploring the trauma caused by the events at the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, and in finding peace for Danny Torrance. Danny has isolated himself through his behaviors into a tiny little box of existence. The film forces him to face the world once more. It wants to acknowledge that evil doesn't just lurk in isolated hotels in the mountains, it's everywhere, and it preys on the most vulnerable amongst us while we turn a blind eye.The horror of this film isn't as primal as The Shining but nevertheless it'll seep into your bones, and make you feel the weight of its terror and pain. Those aren't horror movie screams meant to excite and titillate you, those are screams of real human suffering.I've no idea how faithful this film is to the novel, but I do know it's damn effective at what it's trying to do. If you're up for it, Doctor Sleep is one of the best horror/thrillers to come out this year.8/10 Shine on.",Doctor Sleep

The movie is too long for modern day audience. But it was nostalgic and fun to revisit the location and scenes from The Shining. And its always nice to see Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson.

Where the original was a master-class in narrative, cinematography and acting, DS just feels drawn out and uninspired.DS is an adaptation of Stephen King's own novel, so the source material comes from the mind of it's original creator. However, the movie we ended up with resembles more a series of gimmicks and misplaced fan-service than a new meaningful chapter in Danny Torrance's life.When blatantly recreating Kubrick's scenes, DS is rather grotesque and when it follows its own narrative, it is dully unconvincing.",Doctor Sleep

1325,alfiepinahoblyn,A good movie but not a very good shining movie,7,3 December 2019,"First of, I would like to point out the pros of this movieThis movie is surprisingly terrifying for a modern horror movie (although not to the level of the original) and satisfyingly doesn't include jump scares it's cheap tricks. It's use of a slow burn throughout the antagonists hunt for more victims is honestly terrifying and the oblivious nature of the protagonist is less annoying and more of nerve racking. In a sense of tone, it is very consistent, never being too serious but also never too silly. Fan service was a problem that I anticipated might be distracting in a film like this but it was kept to a minimum which was nice. The old characters were excellently built upon and the new characters I also started rooted for. The plot was relatively decent, it was what you would expect for a shining sequel. The cinematography was outstanding and really showed both inspiration from Kubrick meticulous craft and Flanagan's own talent. Editing was also crafted in an appealing way, and was a surprise to see that the director also edited this film as well, knowing that their was more creative control is somewhat comforting.But of course their were cons. The biggest problem with this movie is over-explanatory lore. Not only is the danger of the overlook hotel demeaned by the introduction of Danny's boxes showing that these ghosts have an easy weakness (not to say that it also shows a flaw in hallorans character for not just simply introducing this idea in the original film) but also the shining itself is made to be like the force from Star Wars. Another problem I had with this film was the colour grading, it's overly saturated on the blue tinge, making it very distracting at times though it did fit sometimes, sometimes. Some lines of dialogue were a bit iffy and the disconnect between Stephen king's original and Kubrick masterpiece proved to have made the film seem split into 2, worrying not to upset fans of each other.Overall, the film capture the filmmaking talent of the shining but dives way to deep into the lore, making the scary part of it, less scary. 7/10",Doctor Sleep

1331,vjsivasankar,Profoundness!!,8,8 November 2019,"I was heavily attached to a well known, a truly classic movie named "" The Shining"". This movie is so important to me and it influenced me in a lot of ways, which then changed as habits. after seeing Kubrick's flick, I decided to read the book. it is the first book that I read with curiosity. The movie has many differences compared to the book and it leaves us with multiple interpretations. And now after many years, the sequel to the movie was released today. I was impressed by the linkage between the prequel and sequel which was shown in the trailer.Mike Flanagan did his job very well and he writes a love letter to the prequel via the making with stunning visuals and the connectivity. It's more than a horror flick; it was an intense drama where the good and evil are on the stage to play their part slowly but engaged us greatly.
Especially, the last 50mins were amazing and showed his brilliance in direction and as well as writing.The overlook hotel, it's always a place where the evil was allowed to grasp everyone. And the readers of shining will surely know about the boilers from there and how it controls everything!!
The girl who shines more than Danny was witty and brave as Danny in their childhood. Abra, I was surprised to see her shine powers are more powerful than Danny. The mystical battle between the true knot and herself was enthralling.Their entrance to the overlook hotel, there I was emotionally connected to see something that was going to happen.
The twin girls; the snow hedged maze; the typewriter; Jack's axe; room no: 237; the old rotten lady; the nostalgia strikes us!!
And yet, the overlook hotel ghosts are still in starvation.Overall, it's a good one and it burns slowly but engages us deeply!!",Doctor Sleep

Great casting and it's almost 3hrs long, which isn't a bad thing at all when it's based on a 600pg novel and is this well done... It doesn't feel like they cut too much out of a great story like they usually do in order to squeeze the book into an hour n' change... Like with The Shining, the ending was COMPLETELY different from the book, but not in a bad way. For fans of the books, it was another surprise alternate ending, and a good one. One that tied both movies together VERY nicely... Bravo to Stephen King and everyone who worked on this film. They did a great job!! My only gripe was that they didn't get Jack Nicholson to play his characters ghost at The Overlook. Not having any of the original cast after decades TOTALLY makes sense, and I think most of them would've hurt the quality of the film. That was the right decision for sure.. However, I think he would've been the one exception well worth making there. Especially considering the small role he would've played in this story...

Terrible acting, terrible script, messy and nonsensical all over the place narrative... and was in no way connected to the tone and feel of the original Kubrick masterpiece in any way other than the few visuals recreated from the original.The repeated overuse of the corpse lady from rm 237 in this film also has in a way almost tainted the original scene for me and how terrifying I found it... but the absolute worst thing about this film is that it includes a graphic and salacious scene of a screaming terrified child being physically tortured and then brutally and horribly murdered.

That creepy lady in the bath was used in too many scenes, it was like the film was trying to use her to get the fright to the audience, it failed ""Oh her again!""

It was much more of an action movie with sparse references to horror, mostly involving bloody gruesomeness. The main source of conflict was between the troupe of psychic monster-humans and good psychic humans, and this plays out just as your regular action films with villians and good guys. I'd even say the film is a bit comic book like, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it handles all the new characters quite well, but it was far from what I expected and I was mostly disappointed in the lack of any scares. It also had quite a bit of well-executed humour throughout the first half and I did enjoy the dialogue in the bartender scene.

Faith that payed off.While I thought the film started off a little messy, it quickly became very interesting and unsettling. It also has a very rich story with interesting characters. A few elements are very Stephen King such as alcoholism and a psychic child, that could be a good or bad thing for some people but Flanagan used them all in a very refreshing way.The performances are exceptional in this film, I had an absolute blast watching Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat. She's charismatic, cunning, and has a sense of humanity despite doing some truly awful (and I mean really awful) things. One particular scene really got under my skin and unsettled me just by how morbid it was.The most surprising and impressive thing this film manages to do though is combine both elements of King's novel as well as Kubrick's film, and be its own film at the same time. It's something that sounds nearly impossible but this film managed to pull it off brilliantly. No it's obviously not as good as The Shining, but it's definitely a worthy sequel",Doctor Sleep

And they try and kill a very strong magic girl. Ewan McGregor (who is still one of my favorite actors) is the grown up boy (Danny) from shining, and wants to protect the girl by killing these evil guys. He has hidden his superpower (the ability to ""shine""), but now goes back to the Overlook Hotel where confronts the evil female hat-woman. What? Seriously? It is more funny and cliche than scary, and very predictable. Philosophically dull and somehow involves a lot of unnecessary characters and dull acting. Disappointed.",Doctor Sleep

1367,kathleenbaird-50701,"Almost perfect, until the end",6,3 December 2019,"Kubrick spoiled ""The Shining"" by having Wendy & Danny Torrance drive sedately away on a snowmobile at the end, instead of using Stephen King's apocalyptic destruction of the Overlook.
Mike Flanagan, director & screenwriter, spoiled King's novel, ""Dr. Sleep"" by killing off THREE important characters at the end, for no good reason. It did not promote the storyline at all! The movie, although not exactly like the book, gave the same feelings generated by the book, until then. Was overjoyed to see one of King's stories be as compellingly portrayed as his original story, . The book is one of King's best, and the story was not served well by these deaths.

1371,tomlinnestad,Doctor Sleep - A Worthy Sequel,9,12 November 2019,"Being a huge fan of Kubrick's 'The Shining', as well as Mike Flanagan's previous work, I was truly excited to see the new live action adaption of Stephen King's sequel 'Doctor Sleep'. Having now seen the film, I am happy to say that it exceeded my expectations (that is not to say the film isn't flawed, these flaws however are spoilers, which I will discuss below).The story & script are brilliant, engaging and executed perfectly - expanding on the characters we know and love whilst simultaneously introducing us to new ones equally fantastic. The acting in is also on point; Ewan McGreggor as Danny Torrence is perfect, as is Kyliegh Curran as Abra - a breathe of fresh air. Rose the Hat is a by far a standout in the film as well as her sinister crew. Both Cliff Curtis and Carl Lumbly were also fantastic in their roles. The cinematography in conjunction with it's colour palette is visual stunning and immersive. The film blends old style editing with modern techniques ingeniously, making the film feel new, original and refreshing. There is an emotional pull, tension and thrill - although it is not similar to it's predecessor - it is not attempting to do so, which is why it succeeds. In it's fleeting moments it does try to imitate the first, that is where it ultimately fails. Overall, a spectacularly layered film definitely worth seeing and a worthy sequel.SPOILERSDisclaimer: I honestly thought, aside from the following, the film was perfect. The negatives did not outweigh the many, many positives. One thing I must say I was skeptical about going into the film, were the changes and scenes it recreated from the original...Having seen 'Doctor Sleep', I understand why they had to include a new Danny and Wendy, for if they were to blend the original footage with the new it would have been inconsistent and jarring, HOWEVER, a very MINOR nitpick I noticed was the fact they had changed Danny's eyes from brown to blue - I thought this was done in order to match that of Ewan McGreggors eyes, although I later thought, 'why couldn't he have simply worn contacts' - I believe this was done for the simple wow factor of having Abra's eyes turn from brown to blue when Danny possesses her, which was undeniably very creative and equally effective.Leading up to the visit to the Overlook, I was beyond excited - the music, the aerial shots, everything. Now, I was able to overlook the recasts as it was obviously a logical decision, up until they showed us Jack Torrence. Although this was integral to the plot, it was a major mistake and a MAJOR distraction - I don't like being overly critical (especially seeing how brilliant the film is), but it was almost too cringe-worthy to watch, cheesy even. It disrupted the tone of the film and detracted from the importance of the scene. I believe the scene would have been far more effective if the camera perhaps circled around both Danny and Jack, showing us nothing but the character from behind and maybe out of focus. This could have been topped off with Jack Nicholson lending his voice. Maybe even having an older Jack Nicholson make out he had been searching for Danny in the Overlook for all these years. In my opinion, ANYTHING would have been better and perhaps more impactful than what we got. Even the scenes recreated of Jack with the axe were simply too much, as well as the scares with the other members of the Overlook. The film lacked subtlety in this area. I would have preferred they used original footage from the 4k remaster of Jack running down the hallways, or AT THE VERY LEAST shot new footage without explicitly showing his face. I do not mean to ramble on about the negative aspects - I am simply doing so as it was a key-point in the film.Regardless of the slightly embarrassing recreation of certain shots - the film was hypnotic and dream-like in the best possible way throughout the entire runtime, and handled various character's and their deaths flawlessly. Ultimately the film ended on a beautiful note with Danny reuniting with his Mother, and is a more than worthy sequel to Kubrick's original.",Doctor Sleep
1372,officialakirajredking,"Shine, Shine brighter",8,28 January 2020,"This is probably the best movie I've seen in the mystery genre. 8/10
And also this is a rare film whose time, 2.5 hours pass in one go. For example, the film ""Shine"", I could pause and go for sandwiches. The same film does not want to be interrupted for a second all 2.5 hours. Perhaps because he is probably closer to reality than for me than his first part. I mean, such circles that feed on the vitality of children are likely to actually exist. And in ancient times they were called Kanduki, Lemboys, Klohtuns and so on, depending on the rank in their hierarchy. And also in antiquity there were forces, good ones, which were called by the Heliar and who opposed them, and judging by some sources, on both sides they died in packs during their skirmishes. And their battles were about the same astral and deadly as shown in this film. So this film also carries a historical connotation, which is probably why in some it will respond very strongly inside. I think the film is like a litmus test for you to live or exist, people will not perceive popcorn level, and those who value the life of those will catch those who are still alive in them.",Doctor Sleep

Just about everybody does a phenomenal job, acting-wise, and the cinematography is flawless, especially during the VERY Kubrick-esque Shining scenes.My only complaint about the entire film is that Henry Thomas does the absolute worst possible Jack Nicholson impression I've ever seen/heard.

I must say it's like I was in a trance from beginning to end and was very well pleased.

The movie's not particulary scary, but it's still pretty damn entertaining, so 150 minutes didn't seem that long. It's great that Flanagan didn't try to copy Cubrick (because no one can beat his brilliant adaption of ""The Shining""), but instead he made this movie his own. All the performances in this movie were amazing (especially young Kyliegh Curran). I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who liked the original ,but don't expect something similar to the Cubrick's vision, because it's really different.

The original has so many layers and I have watched hours and hours of analysis of this movie, it is pure intelligence on steroids. I therefore had high expectations towards Doctor Sleep and was really looking forward to watching it with a positive mindset. Unfortunately I think Buffy the vampire slayer got into it. Ridiculous evil eyes effects. No suspence. No deep psychological insanity, just superficial. The two stars is a reward for having the courage to go near The Shining.",Doctor Sleep

Loved so many things about it, and that Flanagan made his own film, staying true to most of Doctor Sleep, while revisiting the Kubrick film.However, Flanagan dropped the ball at the very end. Flanagan focused so much on trying to reconcile the ending to The Shining novel, I think he completely lost the ending to Doctor Sleep. Doctor Sleep is Danny's story, not Jack's. A major theme of the novel is the reconciliation of the bonds of ""family."" Without spoiling, Danny's fate is necessary for his family's redemption, and should have paralelled Abra's.I hope they shot an alternate ending. An easy fix, with one reshoot. They could easily have Dan projecting from a hospital bed, and more or less kept the same exact ending with Abra, if that's the closing he or Warner Bros. wanted.

1386,cmcphoto,Not a worthy sequel,1,9 November 2019,"This film could have worked without its connection to Kubricks 'The Shining'. It's so misleading with people saying that you shouldn't think of it as the direct sequel but it's own production. I have no idea why the promotion of the film has 'The Shining' written everywhere on the adverts then.There were moments within the film that felt very unnecessary which included the scene with the baseball boy. It wasn't needed and made me feel very uncomfortable, almost like there needed to be some gore just so it could fit into the horror genre.It was pointless bringing back characters such as Wendy and Jack as they weren't acted that well and came across as laughable. Someone even got up and left the screening once 'Jack' appeared. If King hated 'The Shining' so much then why would he approve of these characters coming back - he even called Duvall's Wendy 'misogynistic'. It would have worked better if they used Kings 'blonde Wendy' who he clearly adores.The bathroom scene and bat scene were recreated and weren't needed as if you had seen The Shining then you would clearly know the most iconic moments. I had no idea what was happening at the end when all the cgi characters were trying to strangle Dan. The ending wasn't even memorable.The director clearly went to a lot of effort recreating the gold room and the Colorado lounge for nothing. The whole film had a weird filter and allowed these sets to look cgi heavy. The details such as the colour of the overlook carpets and the 'redrum' detail on the door were off. It almost felt like Kubricks film was metaphorically at the top of the stairs and Flanagan couldn't quite reach it so had to go for the second-hand version.Didn't understand Rose the hat. The name sounds stupid anyway and her accent was all over the place. What was with the use of guns and the fact that these steam people would turn into zombies then disintegrate.This film was so promising and I really looked forward to see doctor sleep but I hated it. Go to see it if you want a laugh and be prepared to cringe throughout. The only good part for fans of The Shining was when Dan Lloyd appeared.When the credits rolled I realised that this film made me love The Shining so much more and how it shouldn't be touched. I thought that both Flanagan and King would learn from Kings own 1997 remake which is awful.",Doctor Sleep

Regardless, I enjoyed Dr Sleep, I didn't think I would because the movie industry cranks out so many nostalgic movies now days just for a quick cash grab and not for quality, and they choke the artists creativity to sell people whatever's trendy instead of letting the artists just make a good product, but I don't feel this way about Dr Sleep. I love the shining and I feel Dr Sleep does it justice, I don't think they spent enough advertising it, and I think Stephen Kings choice of title name doesn't grab you, but the title is fitting, also I'm glad they used the Stanley Kubrick adaptation to build upon, Stephen King is a genius when it comes to writing, but Stephen didn't like the Stanley's version of the shining so he made his own, thank god they built upon the master Stanly's video version and not Stephen's video version.",Doctor Sleep

1397,bellsmail-38959,No... Leave Kubrick's Work Out of This,5,16 November 2019,"About 10 minutes into this disappointment I felt like I was waiting for the opening credits for a made for Netflix series. The characters were generic, the cinematography was bland and while I understand following up Kubrick is an impossible feat, this just felt like it was meant to be a sequel to King's terrible ""made for TV"" version of The Shining, as it too had a more ""spooky ghosts do spooky stuff"", CGI, goofy feeling to it. Not a sequel to one of the most studied and well loved psychological horror movies of all time.I know, it's an actual sequel to King's book. I know, Kubrick changed alot of the book for the film. But that is exactly why they should keep ""Kubrick's the Shining"" as far away from ""King's The Shining"" as possible. King may have done it first, but Kubrick, to me, did it better. King has spent so much time talking openly about how much he hates Kubrick's version. Yet has no problem exploiting Kubrick's work, shots, soundtrack etc. and offers it as audience nostalgia candy to those who pay to see this.I understand that fans of the book may like this more because I presume it is most likely somewhat faithful to the story from that book. That's fair. But as someone who adores Kubrick's version, I just wasn't buying the meshing of Kubrick's version of the characters existing in King's version of The Shining world. It was like watching Jack Torrance in a ""Supernatural"" or ""The Haunting of Hillhouse"" episode and far removed from feeling anything like a ""sequel"" to the original. Other than the names, cringe worthy likeness and the ""Overlook envisioned by Kubrick."" Right down to the wall positions, shots, versions and likeness of ""ghosts"" and even wallpaper. Nostalgia sells.So many theories surround the original Shining. So many scholars praise it's artistry and Kubrick's uncanny ability to show and not tell. This ""sequel"", like a toddler, spoon feeds you like your average crap Hollywood, run of the mill, cash grab ghost story. Then, as a harsher insult, they sprinkle Kubrick's work and versions of the characters into the mix for good measure to prey on your fond memories for one of the greatest horror movies of all time in order to distract you from how cringe worthy this actually is when compared to it's predecessor.One of the greatest triumphs of the original was it's ambiguity. Different people will take different things from the movie and can interpret it in different ways. Were the ghosts real or was Jack simply going insane? Was Danny projecting these horrors or was Jack, unknowingly, projecting them? Is the house really haunted, or is this a case of cabin fever? Here, in this movie, they're like ""um, not only were the ghosts real, but they're shine sucking ghost fiends who all get together to randomly say the same lines they're famous for from the original... yay nostalgia!"" I honestly can't stress enough how much I cringed during this movie.As far as story, it's a Supernatural cat and mouse story. That's about it. Here's a razor thin, brief description of who the antagonists are, now on with the show! Look everyone it's... Not Jack Nicholson, but some dude trying to dress and act like Nicholson? Look, it's ""Not Wendy""...Wendy? I really tried, but it just didn't work for me. I found myself either cringing or rolling my eyes over how obvious they're being with their exploitation of Kubrick's work.I gave it a 5 out of ten due to Ewan McGregor, who I think would play a great adult Danny from Kubrick's version, and for, I admit, the feeling of joy I felt while watching their trip back up to the Overlook. But I guess if you like storylines that would work just as well if not better in a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, than you may love this. 5/10 at best.I'm sorry... but I'm not a fan.",Doctor Sleep

1402,yourfilmbuddy-1980,"Doctor Sleep shines as an amazing sequel full of terror, emotions, and honor for The Shining",9,22 November 2019,"I'm going to say it immediately; Doctor Sleep is one of the best films I've seen this year and maybe the best.The star of this show is writer, director and Editor Mike Flanagan. The screenplay was really good. Since I've read the book I will go over this part now: unlike many adaptations, this one gets the spirit of Stephen King's writing: horror, terror, gore, emotions, and humanity. There are many changes, the main one is following Kubrick's adaptation which largely diverges from the novel (The Shining) hence changing many locations and events from Doctor Sleep. Personally, I wasn't annoyed by that change. And there are other ones that I won't talk about except for one which did piss me off but from a certain angle is poetic. Flanagan borrowed many elements from The Shining novel which was a nice nod for book lovers. Doctor Sleep's plot is very different from The Shining's yet it heavily relies on elements established in the 1980 classic - Doctor Sleep is best enjoyed after viewing The Shining. The plot follows Danny Torrance, now grown up, into his life post-The Shining as a young girl, Abra Stone, discovers the True Knot, a band of immortal beings who feed on kids with The Shine. It is a different plot and a whole different story which I personally loved and found refreshing. The film's runtime is 2 hours and 31 minutes, and it can be really felt. The film is long and slow paced but does it bore? No! I was completely sucked into the film after the first act which was slightly trippy.
When it comes to the characters, Dan Torrance has a great arc. He was portrayed by Ewan McGregor which did a good job. Kyliegh Curran was the star of the show. She did a very accurate performance of Abra from the book and her overall acting was solid and she did truly Shine. Rebecca Ferguson as Rose The Hat was terrifying. Carl Lumbly wasn't good enough as Dick Hallorann nor Roger Dale Floyd as Young Danny. However, Alexandra Essoe did accurately capture Shelley Duvall's performance as Wendy Torrance. And Emily Alyn Lind as Snakebite Andi was a pleasure to be seen on screen. The remaining cast members did a great job.The production design was fascinating. The recreation of The Overlook Hotel was (creepily) nostalgic. The cinematography was captivating. The Visual Effects were really well-done. The score by The Newton Brothers was breathtaking and really put Wendy Carlos' score for The Shining into great use which gave the film a deep and scary atmosphere.Mike Flanagan fascinatingly directed the film. The shots he took, the angles he chose and the scene were mesmerizing. There were many scenes from the book that can be deemed hard to film, yet he executed them in a clear way. In fact, the atmosphere he created resembled Kubrick's. Even though he replicated Kubrick in many places (editing and directing), he still did make the film his own: very different, unique and stunning. There were many jump scares but they were the same type that Kubrick used in The Shining. He even replicated scenes from The Shining with different characters, which was a delight. In addition, the scenes recreated from The Shining were also well-done and I hoped there was more. Mike Flanagan also edited the film. The editing had nods to the 1980 classic, and was masterfully done. We have a true horror film that knows how to scare and deeply disturb.As a horror film, it is scary. It rarely relies on jump-scares and the scary parts are in the unfolding events, music, and directing. What surprised me most and I loved, was emotion. This film almost made me cry at a few points and it doesn't feel empty. It is fueled by feelings and emotions.Doctor Sleep really honors Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and adds humanity to it. It pays The Shining homage and continues the story. The sequel was unnecessary, yes. But was it bad? Absolutely not. I am glad it did not interfere with the mystery left in The Shining's ending and avoided explaining it.In the end, this may be the longest review I've ever written, but that's because I loved Doctor Sleep. It was everything I hoped it would be. At a few scenes I was close to crying, others i was smiling because of references to The Shining.I hope you enjoy it, and shine on dear moviegoer.",Doctor Sleep

Everything about this film is bad - sloppy editing, inconsistent script and therefore weak and unoriginal characters, low quality of visual effects and so on and so on... If you are an admirer of Kubrik's film do not watch Doctor Sleep, you will waste your time. Doctor Sleep is Stranger Things on low budget, not more.",Doctor Sleep

The same cannot be said about this movie. It's a total dissapointment. Not a slightest effort to at least try and to stick to the storyline, or the basic, important facts and twists even though it claims to be based on the novel. Ferguson's acting is the highlight.
There are things that can be excused in book movie adaptions, but this movie is unfortunately not the case.

1418,deanandbarb,Disney?,1,8 March 2020,"I barely made it to the end, but stubborned through (self harm). Loved ""shining"". I was doubtful anything could measure up, but was not ready for how far this fell short. It generated zero psychological or emotional response. It was more on par with Disney's ""Witch Mountain"" than ""The Shining"". Perhaps if I was ten years old it would have some impact. Not really though, I watched Trilogy of horror over Disney at that age. The true sleep doctor is the director along with most of the characters in this movie. I feel that this movie was aimed more at appeasing current trends rather than to produce the type of artistry exhibited in ""The Shining.""",Doctor Sleep
1419,hendricksmd,Missing Key Elements From Novel,8,26 May 2020,"As a massive fan of The Shining, both novel and film, and having thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep the novel, I feel like the film fell slightly flat. Despite quite obviously being made with love, the film missed the mark in several key areas.I greatly appreciated that the filmmakers tried to appease both Kubrick and King fans alike. However, the entire exclusion of the Torrence bloodline that was present in the novel left the ending feeling rushed. ""Dan is okay."" Abra explains to Lucy in the final moments. While it is assumed that Abra explained everything off-screen, Lucy was still likely given zero context on why she would care that Dan was alright. To Lucy, Dan was just some guy that kinda sorta kidnapped her daughter (regardless if it was to protect her or not) and was indirectly involved with her husband's murder. Despite the off-screen assumption, the fact that Dan and Lucy are half-brother-and-sister as stated by the novel would've seriously strengthened the notion that Lucy does indeed care about Dan. Not only this but its inclusion would've solidified why Abra calls Dan, ""Uncle Dan"". She didn't ""know"" until later in the novel but via the Shine, Abra knew perhaps on a subconscious level and thus felt comfortable calling Dan by this title of endearment. The blood-tie also explains why Abra and Dan Shine so significantly due to their grandfather and father respectively; Jack. Lastly, the tie gives more context as to how and why Abra was able to reach out to Dan. Aside from being metaphorical lighthouses in regards to their Shine, the blood tie inclusion would've solidified why those two specifically, rather than just random strangers.",Doctor Sleep

1424,emilianotca,Better than The Shining,8,13 June 2020,"Being a huge fan of SKs work, I was quite disappointed with The Shining for not sticking to several of the author's original ideas. This movie is not 100% equal to the book either; in fact, the ending is totally different... however, the main ideas are kept unchanged: the supernatural touch, Dan's connection to Abra and Dick Hallorann and his fight against alcoholism, to say the least. Speaking of the ending again, I must admit that it's even BETTER than the originals. I was going to give it a 7, maybe a 6 after Billy and Dave's death and the 30sec appearance of John Dalton.... but the ending was so amazing (they even fixed the original The Shining's mistake of not burning the Overlook down!) that I changed my mind.
VERY nice. I'd totally see it again and recommend it.",Doctor Sleep

In those areas it is fantastic. What I disliked was the wonky ending, where, for whatever reason, the director and screenwriters decide 'Let's give it an entirely different ending.' I guess this was the attempt to please the Kubric fans out there. Ah yes, there are plenty of Kubric Easter eggs. And the cinematography itself was very well done althroughout. But honestly, I would have been much more content if we just dealt openly with the elephant in the room, which is that while Kubric's film was a masterpiece in horror, it ABSOLUTELY SUCKED as an adaptation of the novel. I would have preferred an ending here that just loved the original enough to not try to copy Kubric. Yes, the Kubric fans who never read the book would have been upset, but it would have been more honest. And truthfully the novel here has a MUCH more satisfying ending than the film.",Doctor Sleep

I hadn't read this book but I read The Shining several times since jr high. Loved it!! Many don't appreciate the Kubrick version but I grew up with it and have seen it at least 100 times 😝
This story of Doctor Sleep is an entirely different story. The first story was about confinement and after escape and moving on, this movie introduces a bigger picture of the power known to some, as the Shining.
You can kind of think of this movie like XMen.... people, mostly children have a variety of psychic abilities that they use in everyday life. Friends and family adjust or ignore their gifts, but it just so happens that some beings find that delicious.
After years of trying to forget, Danny Torrence is beckoned as people that share his gift, children, are falling victim to a gang of energy feeders, desperate for their next meal.

Having read the book I knew what was coming to some extent but the adaption for the screen ruined it. OMFG they recreated the Jack Torrance role with another actor who looks nothing like Jack Nicholson! The same goes for some of the other actors re-cast from the original. Just utterly ruined it for me.There are actually some good scenes and scares and up until the final quarter it is an ok film and much as the book but the last quarter was a shambles and I could hardly watch.At least the consulted Stephen King got the ending he always wanted.To sum up, this film will suit the noobs but sadly not the purists.

That is why I didn't give it a 10.For a 2 1/2 hour movie, where it got the job done in telling a great tale... it left me kind of empty, but that could also mean a future movie or TV series so I am not complaining.I do love the fact that they brought in old elements from The Shinning and wished that they would have done it a bit more. I can't go into detail without spoiling anything but, I think it might have to do with the budget of the film. All in all I wasn't truly disappointed.

It provides nostalgia, countless Easter eggs, on point casting for every character, and most importantly the terror and suspense which define the very multiverse The Shining was built into. Ewan McGregor provides an incredible portrayal of Danny Torrance grown-up, through all the struggles that come with post-Overlook life. Rebecca Ferguson's amazing performance as the erratic Rose the Hat makes you cringe, and on edge every time she is on screen. The biggest surprise though was, relatively new actress, Kyliegh Curran who absolutely kills it as Abra Stone. Her confidence on screen just radiates and provides not only a compelling character, but one that is able to match both Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson. I plan on rewatching this film multiple times after it's release and you should as well.",Doctor Sleep

The list of reasons for disliking it is long but nothing about It grabs you at all, characters are dull, the dialogue is dry, Ewan Mcgregor hardly delivers a convincing line and am unsure why he was cast as an older Danny Torrance at all. Flip flopping locations while not really explaining much. Felt like a cheap made for tv spin off cash in which had more resemblance to a darker X-Men chapter instead of a Shining follow up. The first attempt at watching this i was so bored by half way i had no idea who was who or what the hell was going on. Everyone raves about it but this one has clearly beaten me intellectually because the 2 hours of what i saw must have gone way over my head as I don't see the point in it at all!

1482,toontjevanboxstael,An improvement from the (2d part of the) book... but that ain't saying much.,6,26 May 2021,"THE GOOD
+ The Dick Halloran solution. In the start, it's not clear if Dick is dead or if he's simply talking with Danny from a distance. This was an exceptionally clever way to reconcile his diverging storylines in the first book and movie.+ The camerawork. Flanagan has watched Kubrick's movie attentively, and in this regard it really pays off. Especially the bird's view shots of the Knot, combined with their choreographic movements, invoke the image of a pack of undead hyenas. Goosebumps.+ The effects. Overall, the use of special effects was effective and not too overdone. I was especially impressed with the cycling of the Knot, and their eyes were very creepy.+ The Snakebite Andi (and Billy) pay-off. In the book, Andi was set up as an important character, only to die without leaving the slightest impact. At the same time, Billy, while a great character, clearly has nothing to do anymore in the final chapters. By making Andi use her power on key moments, including killing Billy, she becomes a relevant character with a satisfying impact. Bravo.+ The Italian grandma plotline got ditched. Thank God. Everything about that plotline, from the forced italian tropes to granny's affair and its implications, and ESPECIALLY the whole cancer breath thing, were plain stupid and single-handedly destroyed the book.+ The Overlook Hotel Story Hook. In the book, the reasons for ending up at the Overlook's location were nonsensical. The reasoning of Danny in the movie was so simple, so elegant, and so solid that my mouth fell open. Of course! The Overlook feeds on the 'magical' shining, and is thus a huge threat to people with the shining. But in that case, an even more 'magical' creature as Rose must be even more attractive to the Hotel, and she'd be even more in danger. What a beautiful set-up to make the heroes bring themself into danger, and progress the plot at the same time!+ The rework of characters. Combining Billy and the AA guy, giving the doctor a different role, making Abra's dad both more and less important, they're all intelligent choices. Special props for the Knot, again: they're fewer in number, but with more defined powers and characters, making them seem more threatening (at least for a while).+ Related to that, the killing of characters. No less than three important characters die who didn't in the book, and all three are intelligent, brave decisions that made the story better.THE BAD
The Knot. While they're depicted much more effectively than in the book, they're still terribly incompetent, and never seem to get a break. As a result, they're simply not threatening enough to be a good antagonist in a scary movie. There were some redeeming changes from the book, like Andi killing Billy, Rose breaking Dan's enchantment, and Crow not being an utter retard, but in the end they still seem pathetic bad guys.The guns. Seriously, if Dan had just waited for Rose to show up and shot her, the movie had been done half an hour later.The power level. Another sin from the book that Flanagan could simply not do anything about, but which ruins the mood like none other. At times, this feels like a superhero movie. At no time, it feels like horror.The parents at the ending. Don't get me wrong, Jack's 'saving' appearance in the book was even worse and incredibly cheesy. But, in an odd way, this movie set him up well as the bartender, and COULD have pulled off what the book tried to do, but then totally didn't. When the ghosts were done with Rose and turned to Dannny, I was rooting with all my heart for Jack to appear and have one moment of redemption, much like he had in the first book, by keeping the Hotel at bay for just a few seconds so Danny could escape. Instead, he never shows up anymore... instead we have a scene that's possibly even cheesier. I enjoyed Shelley Duval's Wendy at much as anyone else, but the mother's ghost had absolutely no business being there.The acting. Jeeeezus, what's going on with the acting? It feels like a t.v. Soap opera at times, but less overacted (and thus less fun).Speaking of less fun, the movie is boring at times. I believe it's the acting combined with the rather shallow characters. I didn't feel for anyone in this movie, except briefly for Abra's dad and a little bit for Crow Daddy.THE UGLY
* The diversity quota. I've read and heard quite some people who were annoyed by 'black Abra' and Cliff Curtis' Billy. Personally, I wasn't really bothered by it. Kyliegh Curran didn't do a bad job as Abra (She didn't 'shine' by any means either, mind you), and there was no reason for her to be white, so why not? I actually liked Zackary Momoh as her father. The guy had a mere two scenes, and still I felt more when he died than for any other character. And it's true that the novel was strangely short on non-white characters. Still, it did feel very heavy handed, and I can't shake the feeling that 'good' Billy is a maori now only to serve as some weird counterweight to 'evul' Crow Daddy.* The use of Shining imagery. I understand it, it was well done and overall it felt respectful. But at times, especially in the end, it became terribly tedious and overdone. Someone else compared it to a Disney ride, and that's about right. Especially the contiuous use of Mrs. Massey really didn't do that character any good. That being said, where the hell was the guy in the bear costume? He scared the hell out of me as a kid, I was astonished to see he was the only one left out of the party!* The lack of sex. Don't get me wrong, I don't think 'sexing up' a story is ever a good idea. But this movie was surprisingly tame. To come back to Mrs. Massey, the reason she worked so well as a monster in the first movie, was because she appeared as a beautiful woman first. Rosie too, uses glamour to charm and enthrall people - she literally uses sex as a tool. Rebecca Ferguson is a beautiful woman, but at no moment in the movie did I get 'sexual' vibes from her, and in this case I think it did a disservice to the character and the tone of the story.Actually, there's a good example of how sexiness can help to set the tone early on in this movie: when a young Danny wakes up after a night out, we first see the beautiful naked woman next to him. Then we notice with him that she'd puked all over the bed, and things go downhill from there fast. This scene first 'seduces' us to the party lifestyle, only to immediately pull the rug from underneath us as we realise the state of Danny's existence. That's some effective film making right there.* The rushed first part. Of the book, I mean. This is a personal one. I absolutely loved the first half of Doctor Sleep. It was high-end King writing. And the movie raced through it. Do I think that's a bad thing? Not really, I understand they didn't want to make a drama about a struggling psychic alcoholic, no matter how much I'd like to see that. The problem is that the second half of the book, starting somewhere around the time Abra and Dan meet each other irl, isn't a horror book material either. It's teen fantasy garbage, and I still can't believe King wrote this himself. So making a horror out of this is... challenging at best, and it shows.* (last point, I promise). A note on Baseball boy. A lot of reviews complain about the torture scene. This confuses me. It's a movie based on a Stephen King book. Of course there's going to be some horrible things happening. Moreover, it's an important part of the plot, so it's not like Flanagan could just write around it. If anything, I was once again surprised about how 'tame' the scene was, but overall I thought it was well done, chilling without tasteless gore.CONCLUSION
Yes, there's some cheesy swooning over Kubricks film, and the acting is at moments so bad it's almost good again, but overall this movie is an improvement over the second half of the book that it's based on. Flanagan is clearly capable of turnign a good book into a good movie. The problem is that the second half of Doctor Sleep is not a good book. And as they say, no matter how much you 'shine' (heh) up a turd, in the end it's still a turd.",Doctor Sleep
1483,marysidley,True Stephen King,9,20 November 2019,"At nearly 40, I've been reading Stephen King since my Elementary school days. In fact, my Eight Grade Writing project was on one of his books. I've always been a fan of his vivid imagery and how well he's able to draw your imagination into the story and you can lose yourself in the world he's created. This is no different and to say that they've finally made a big screen version that stayed true to his vision and honored the full story in all it glory. I was initially concerned, after the recent failure with The Dark Tower. A-list actors who could have taken the most epic of all of his novels, one that actually tied most of his novels together in some way, and turned it into the most lucrative franchise anyone has seen since Harry Potter. Instead they butchered the story completed and condensed an altered version into one movie. 20+ years of story line down the toilet.
Not with this. This movie....Probably the best movie I've seen in the theater all year. Hands down, I got so sucked into the story that I forgot where I was, I was IN the story. I actually yelled at the character on scream (Dan) before I realized I'd done it aloud 🤦‍♀️🤣 It only has a few more days in theater but if you get the chance, GO!

It was scary because a husband and a father suddenly turned against his beloved. You never knew what was going through his mind or if it was something supernatural going on. ""Dr Sleep"" throws all the mysteries out the window and makes everything obvious instead. There is supernatural, there is ghosts, there is monsters.The worst and scariest things in life are the things we can't explain or do not understand. Where our minds starts imagining instead of knowing what is going on. ""The Shining"" could play with that part of our consciousness. ""Dr Sleep"" ditches all of that and tries to explain and ground our imagination into something concrete. Doing so it just falls flat. Nothing is scary in this movie.

The movie does as good a job as it can trying to constrain the book into a movie experience while staying true to the spirit of the book. The themes of addiction, family, mental illness, etc. are still expressed really well. The alterations made to the movie are understandable and do a good job of not detracting too much from the book. Also, I think they did a great homage to the ending that King wanted from the original film. All around great performances with some definite standouts: Rose the Hat, Crow Daddy, Abba, Snakebite Andi, and Dan. I definitely enjoyed those portrayals.

The film itself is beautifully done but a beautifully done anticlimax.
Although the 'Vampire' type characters are a real tangent to the Shining universe, trying to tie them into the backdrop (late in the film) to the Hotel was just as contrived as it was lame.

Well crafted were the early scenes that took place in 1980 at the time of The Shining and were off shoots of when that story was taking place. The acting and story are impeccable. It was a slow burn in terms of horror, but moreso and importantly great story and how its intertwined within itself over the last 30-35 years. No cheap trick ""gotcha"" moments. Rebecca Ferguson was amazing , and a very enticing seductive villain who you were enchanted to despise.

Plenty of references to the Kubrick film (overlook hotel, tracking shots above cars, soundtrack, shots fading into each other, actors playing weak versions of characters from the Kubrick film etc) but with little impact and actually just serve to remind the viewer how superior the Kubrick original was in comparison, as a film and overall experience. Finally, rose the hat (really King, that's some kiddy story right there!) has an accent crossing from Irish to American all the time and it's seriously distracting.
Save yourself a few hours and just rewatch kubricks the shining, a superior film in every sense, and you get to see the the real Jack Nicholson performance rather than a cheap washed-out lookalike.",Doctor Sleep

1537,me-1108,Even worse than I feared,2,28 July 2021,"I love the Kubrick Adaption ""The Shining"" and seeing this ""sequel"" made me love the Kubrick film even more. By repeating so many iconic scenes from The Shining, Doctor Sleep lessens itself. It seems to me they where doing a checklist: the twins, the tricycle in the corridor, the lady in the bathtub, the scene in the ballroom at the bar, etc., etc.It could have been much more. When you do a sequel, people don't want to see the stuff they already love and have fond memories of. (Just watch the new trailer from the ""new"" Ghostbuster movies - same problem)There is no magic in Doctor Sleep and the storyline with the cult seemed very cheap, more fitting for a tv series. And the conclusion being ""nobody really dies - so it's all good"" that's just cheesy.The actors were good and the camera work too. But as always: that can't save a weak plot.",Doctor Sleep

I enjoyed the original, the character development, locations and overall feel of the movie. So going into this sequel I was hoping for a continuation of that thrill of the first movie. While I did enjoy the comparison with the original, I think the first half of the movie was too drawn out. There were too many scenes that could have been shortened or even omitted to give the ending a better conclusion. I also agree with others that they could have used CGI for important characters than using another actor in comparison. I feel like the ending could have been so much better. It was okay, but disappointing on some things.",Doctor Sleep

1543,dahurts,"Good film overall, but falls short of its potential.",6,11 November 2019,"Doctor Sleep delivers some powerful scenes, one that may be upsetting to sensitive viewers, and does a pretty good job of being a mixture of The Shining novel and film (Kubrick's, of course).Rose the Hat came across much as I pictured her from the novel. The other True Knit villains, with maybe the exception of Snakebite Andi, could have been better developed, but of course all novels have to be trimmed down for pacing and time.I love Ewen McGregor, but I believe John Cusack or maybe Jeremy Renner would have made a much better adult Danny Torrance. But kudos to the portrayal of Abra Stone, especially her cockiness and intensity when facing off with Rose.Visually, the film was way too blue filtered. Think of The Shining film's vivid, true colors that gave us such chills with their contrasting harshness to the blanketing white snow. When I'm watching a movie and ""noticing"" the color filtering being done, then it loses its effect on me.And while I enjoyed the movie for the most part, I would've liked to have seen Momo, Silent Sarey, and the Overlook history from the novel rather than the film, with the corresponding ending more faithful to the Doctor Sleep novel than the twists put into the film that seemed to me just a bit too much trying to appease the Kubrick fans (of which, I'm most certainly one!).Popcorn was good, too. ;-)",Doctor Sleep

1545,ganuke,WTF!!!???,1,19 February 2020,"I'd looked forward to seeing this movie since I heard is was being made. It started off well enough. I thought it was cutting a fair amount of the book, but that can be expected when a less than great director gets his hands on a movie based on a book. But then when it progressed and the makers of this film decided that they knew plot and storyline better than Stephen King things went all to ****. Not only did they decide to rewrite Doctor Sleep,they also decided to rewrite The Shining. What? Were they counting on the fact that reading a book has become a lost art, especially amongst their target audience that nobody would notice that the end product had very little to do with the excellent novel they stole the title from? Non-readers wouldn't know this, but towards the end of the Shining, the Overlook hotel was blown all to ****, leaving nothing but the smoking ruins. That fact was integral to both The Shining and Doctor Sleep. Non-readers will never know that during the book, that Danny was in actuality Abra's uncle and that her mom was Danny's half sister, with Jack Torrance being both of their father. They also won't know that the last battle against the Knot was fought in their home campgrounds on the grounds of the former Overlook Hotel in Colorado and not in some woods back east. They will also not know that neither Billy nor Abra's father nor Danny died but shared a happy life back home after the Knot's demise. And most of all they will never know that Jack Torrance's spirit intervened between Rose and Danny in the final confrontation or that her neck was broken and she wasn't consumed by a pack of cannibalistic ghouls from the hotel's past. And she sure wasn't killed in the Overlook Hotel because it had been been blown to **** and left in smoking rubble 40 years before the events in Doctor Sleep. I gave this movie a 4 and that's far too lenient. I will change that.",Doctor Sleep

1553,JulezTheFiend,This movie is not that...,5,13 November 2019,"Before getting into this, I must warn you of 2 things, this post contains spoilers and I have never read a Stephen King book (not a reader).
That being said - I won't discuss the rewriting of the lore of The Shining.
So, the trailers definitely imply that this would be a sequel to The Shining staring the well-loved MrGregor.
This movie is not that...
What it is, is a superhero flick with a frik ton of cheesy lines and a weird amount of blatant references from the shinning.
Yes, yes, I get that it's the story of lil' Danny all grown-up using alcohol to deal with his problems. C'mon it's 2019 everyone is using opiates now. But addiction is serious, and AA wants you to take this film they've sponsored seriously. Mkaaay.
Also, please note that big Danny is not the protagonist of this film - it's an omnipotent teenager that I'm very sure didn't need any help from this random bum she met on the ""outternet"".
Who seems very apathetic about the death of her father? Hmmm possible undiscussed daddy issues? Whatever.
The bad-guys in this film are a child-murdering gang of weirdly dressed... Yeah, they're basically gypsies... Yeah, they're definitely the definition of gypsies.
And even though they have all sorts of super-powers (like telling people what to do and other powers that aren't really mentioned or displayed in the movie) they seem to be pretty vulnerable to bullets and sharp objects. Possibly even more so than regular people.
After all of these characters are introduced and there's not much boring things to throw at your face, 45 year old Danny decides it would be a great idea to go on a 20 hour road trip with a teenage girl to an abandoned, haunted hotel to fight a gypsy woman, with a funky hat (that you would think would have meaning because of her reaction to people touching it but it doesn't ), without any of the 10 guns they had available. What the actual... Sigh. That's when the scenes and references from the shining get puked all over you like a drunk fan-girl shouting here's Johnny as loud as they can.
AND to defeat this magic fiend, that so badly wants to have sex with Danny that she basically dry humps him in mid-fight, Danny must unbox all of the demons he's encountered throughout his entire life.
Bruh that's like Goku going Super Saiyan on Hercule (Mr. Satan).
I could go on but I won't - This review is completely subjective
Doctor Sleep could've and should've been a masterpiece.
But it's not - it sucks (my opinion - mkay)",Doctor Sleep
1554,amerika-39615,A gorgeous fan service for Stephen King readers,8,9 November 2019,"By itslef it's a little above the average of the hundred of thriller movies in the industry. Yet if you red The Shinning Novel or Doctor Sleep, the movie will get you on the edge of your seat until the last frame.
It fixes certain diferences between the book and the original movie, and it's kinda dissapointing not to see some scenes for the original movie, in moments where those would fit like a puzzle piece; however, elements such as the original music pieces or the ""easter eggs"" are everything a Stephen King fan would love.",Doctor Sleep
1555,Lougoshi,A Stellar Sequel,8,27 November 2019,"This was an excellent sequel to ""The Shining"". The film expertly shows the continuation of addiction passed from father to son.

That said, the cast was brilliantly chosen, including Rebecca Ferguson as walking that line between alluring and deadly. Ewan McGregor is excellent in portraying Dan as constantly on the edge between his addiction and the fear that got him there. Kyleigh Curran steals the show in the scenes inside Abra's mind and every scene with Abra and Rose squaring off against each other sizzles with anger. While it isn't quite the adaptation of the book, it does serve as a worthy sequel to the movie for The Shining, and a good thriller.",Doctor Sleep

1562,stungunmilli,Could have been so much better...,2,23 July 2020,"I am of the Stephen King fandom section that believes Stanley Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" was a disgraceful portrayal of a masterful work of horror fiction. I am well-aware that books dont always translate perfectly to screen, but i have seen some amazing attempts. I was so hopeful when i saw that ""Dr. Sleep"" had become a motion picture, especially with the incredible Ewan McGregor taking on the role of the adult ""Dan Torrence"".
The source material of ""Dr. Sleep"" - Stephen King's sequel to ""The Shinning - portrayed a beautiful and redemptive story to the horrific events of ""The Shinning"". Dan Torrence seeing, accepting, and conquering the alcoholism that served his father up to the Overlook, Dan accepting that he has a gift and learning to use that gift to help others, seeing that Halloran was right and that Dan did in fact guide another alone the ""Shine"" path.... eh, all that to say, if you're looking to see an incredible story honestly portrayed on screen - especially if you're looking for a Steven King novel to receive it's due as a feature film - this is not the film for you. And i suspect that if you dont have the background of the Stephen King novel going in to this, it's going to be a lot for you to swallow in one move's worth of time.

It wasn't excellent but it wasn't bad. Doctor Sleep is the sequel to Stephen King's NOVEL The Shining and to be fair it was a pretty good sequel to the story. Now the movie on the other hand was a bit ""meh"". It really felt like a Netflix movie and a bit too teenager-esqe. The story was good, decent acting and characters, I just wished they hadn't changed the ending from the one in the book. Also, the movie would've been 110x better if it was directed by Jordan Peele or Ari Aster because that would've added a bit more thriller, mystery and some element of horror and that would've at least lived up to Stanley's in some way.

I had read the shining and seen the film, and a huge fan of both, but doctor sleep takes the story of the shining and tries to create some strange supernatural story taking aspects of the original film and making it into some strange universe where the shining is some common trait that people inherit and they all are connected. In the shining it was a special trait that tony and dick had but in this film it's been normalized and holds no suspense, nonetheless there is this strange hat lady that is apparently the protagonist who is trying to take control of tony and this black girl. It defeats the purpose of the shining where jack goes mad due to the evil nature of the hotel. I'm extremely dissecting and upset in this film, it's nothing like the shining, steering down some strange road. If you love the shining and admire it for how special of a film and story it is, then don't take dr strange to heart, it's TRASH.",Doctor Sleep
