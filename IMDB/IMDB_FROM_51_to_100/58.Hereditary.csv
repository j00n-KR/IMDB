0,TheLittleSongbird,Fear in the family,8,28 July 2018,"Have always had a lot of appreciation for horror, even though it isn't my favourite genre, and 'Hereditary' was a film that immediately held my interest in seeing it with such an arresting concept. Although more polarising with audiences it was very positively received films critically, having more than once seen and heard it described as one of the year's best.Despite reviewing it only now, 'Hereditary' was another film viewed weeks ago but with so many commitments and such a big to watch and review list it's taken a long time to get round to reviewing it. While the polarisation is understandable, count me in as another person who was really impressed by 'Hereditary', very nearly loving it even. Of my recent 2018 viewings, it definitely stands out as one of the better ones and it is not hard to see whether it is considered in as high regard as it is. Can also see why it has been compared to 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining', having just as much the same amount of dread and hellish atmosphere, and also couldn't help thinking of another slow-burn horror from this year that divided opinion but was also critically acclaimed 'A Quiet Place'. Not in concept and they're different films, but in that they're polarising but mostly positively regarded and both films that were very well made, well acted and unnerving.It is hard to know where to begin praising something with so many positives. 'Hereditary' is incredibly well made visually, one of the most audacious and best-looking films in the genre in recent years. The photography is both dream-like and nightmarish, while the film is slickly edited, atmospherically lit and the spacious house, with a mix of the audacious and the ghoulish, is like its own character.The music is haunting and adds to the unnerving atmosphere as does some of the most effective sound editing and design of the year, never being obvious or cheap and providing a lot of eeriness. The writing flows well and never becomes corny or overly-wordy, sometimes even thought-provoking in particularly in what it has to say about grief and trauma.While a deliberate slow-burn for me 'Hereditary' was not dull at all, helped enormously by the atmosphere and the near-perfect balance of family drama, which was often very poignant and packs a powerful emotional wallop, and horror, where there is not any over-reliance on predictable horror tropes and cheap scare tactics and actually was frightening and suspenseful. It always is interesting seeing film debuts and there are some fine ones out there, Ari Astor's directing is remarkably well accomplished with a fine eye for detail and an adeptness for how to pace such an atmosphere.Characterisation-wise, 'Hereditary' is quite compelling and there is a realism to it. The performances are near-perfect, with Gabriel Byrne occasionally slightly under-playing but generally it is one of his best performances in a while. The star here is Toni Collette in a truly marvellous and often moving turn that calls for a mix of grief and terror, Collette grieves with pathos and conveys terror with intensity. Alex Woolf is the other standout for similar reasons though Milly Shapiro is not to be neglected.It is a shame that the ending is rushed and that plausibility loses its way at this point, instead coming over as silly and like the film had run out of steam.Otherwise, a very good film that was very nearly excellent. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Hereditary
1,Leofwine_draca,"Good scares, but needed more story",6,16 February 2019,"HEREDITARY is a deadly serious, slow-burning horror movie that comes across as a mixed bag overall. I admire it for being more focused and scary than pap like the INSIDIOUS or CONJURING movies, but at the same time the writing is a little bit weak, with a lot of built-up mystery and little in the way of satisfactory explanation and natural storytelling. Toni Collette leads the cast and delivers a strong performance (although the younger actors are better), playing a grieving mother beset by family tragedy and frequently strange events. The running time is overlong but there are some good scare sequences here, especially in the second half, shocking twists, and some surprisingly gruesome interludes.",Hereditary
2,SnoopyStyle,intriguing,6,1 September 2018,"Annie Graham (Toni Collette) delivers the eulogy at her mother's funeral. She makes scaled miniature models. She has her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), son Peter (Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). She befriends Joan (Ann Dowd) from her support group. Her family has issues which come to a head after a deadly accident.This horror sets a solid sullen mood and then it turns crazy supernatural. The first half slightly bores me. I find it hard to get invested in these characters. Toni is acting her butt off and I almost don't care. I really need to get involved with Peter but his weirdness doesn't intrigue me. I wonder if I could connect with him if he isn't shot in such an ugly manner. I totally understand the descent into hell but it's not as harrowing with a character that I'm only marginally invested. This has potential. It actually took me two attempts to watch this. I had to abandon the first attempt after a half hour because my attention was just drifting. I knew I needed to give it my best effort and it paid off with an intriguing movie.",Hereditary
3,Horst_In_Translation,Makes good use of established formulas,6,18 June 2018,"""Hereditary"" is a new American movie from 2018 and maybe, at least at this point, considered the defining horror film of the year. It runs for comfortably over 2 hours, which is unexpectedly long for the genre and the most known cast member here is Oscar nominee Toni Collette who of course has a history of strong horror films and this one adds further quality to her body of work in this field. Writer and director is Ari Aster and this is his very first full feature movie. Nice way to start a career if we ignore his short film works for a little moment. As for the cast, we also have Gabriel Byrne in here who was probably the one cast member that is the biggest reason to watch the film. He does not have Collette's material, probably not even Wolfe's material in terms of awards bait, but he is as quietly convincing as I hoped he would be. Now for the film itself, it was handled pretty convincingly. Some scenes stay in the head really while, for the most part, the film also works as a whole. The one scene that stayed in the head the most was of course the fatal party and everything that resulted from it as well as the chase for the teenage boy at the very end. Interestingly enough, he is at the core of my favorite scenes it seems. The very final scene with the diabolical references and the evil deity parts was not really to my liking. Maybe there the movie tried to be too much for its own good, but it seems critics disagree, so watch for yourself. Jump scares are okay as a whole, executed profoundly as everything else about the film really.Apparitions of the old lady add their fair share too as do the parts with scene stealer Ann Dowd and her talking with spirits. But this also resulted in maybe the weakest part story-wise as seeing how scared Collette's character is after this particular scene, I just cannot believe she is all for talking to her own daughter immediately only one or two scenes later. But of course there are some flaws for a film with this running time. Taking this into account, it still went by pretty quickly and you could see the creativity and wit attached to the project. For people who love horror movies more than I do, maybe really adore them, this is close to a must-see. For everybody else who does not hate the genre, it's a good watch nonetheless I assume. There are really many strengths to it, sometimes also fairly simple aspects like the young daughter's physical looks or the many references about severed heads and even if they are pretty gross like the one with the pigeon, you just cannot look away. Other moments like the many dollhouse references did not work that well for me, but it is also all subjective here what you will like and what you won't like. Maybe these parts are exactly what some others will appreciate. So overall, there is no need to hesitate for me in what I give this movie, namely a positive recommendation. The highs were higher than how low the lows were if you know what I mean. And also the positive sides were more frequent than the negative parts in terms of the story. Shame they messed things up a bit at the end. Still go watch it, at best when it's dark outside (or inside) of course. Thumbs-up.",Hereditary
4,nogodnomasters,I never wanted to be your mother,5,24 June 2018,"The story centers on Anne (Toni Collette) the mom of the family. We discover her recently deceased mother had a private circle of friends and performed private rituals. We also find out that mental instability runs in the family. When another family member passes things begin to unravel as Annie turns to seances. The film was too long and too slow building up. It held my interest, but only by a thread. They killed off the character that held my interest. Guide: f-word. No sex or nudity.",Hereditary
5,kosmasp,(re?)Born this way,9,23 November 2018,"There was quite some buzz around this. As much buzz as last years ""It comes at night"" had or this years ""Quiet Place"" (which I have not seen yet). Now this buzz that build up, might be harmful to some. Especially if you are looking for a horror movie that has jump scare after jump scare. A movie that moves along fast and leaves you no room to breathe.Because this is not what this movie is about. It may not even be about what you first think it is about (or it mght as well be). The mystery around it, the slow moving pace, the dreadfulness surrounding it, make it (or as I stated above break it for some). Overall the quality of acting, cinematography, set design, directing is just amazing. If you care about all those things more than just entertainment (and I'm not bashing the latter or whatever preference you may have), than this movie will have you on the edge of your seat ... guessing away, how and where this will take you ...",Hereditary
6,lee_eisenberg,drama horror,6,2 May 2019,"Ari Aster considers his ""Hereditary"" more of a family drama than a horror movie. I can see that. It does focus more on grief than on jump scares. It's no comparison to ""The Shining"" in creating terror (but what movie is?).There were certainly a few scenes that shocked me. The downsides are the uneven performances and a few things that look kind of silly. But that dollhouse and a couple of tricks that rival Hitchcock in using non-verbal ways to tell the story make for one fine movie. I hope that Aster makes more movies like this.",Hereditary
7,jboothmillard,Hereditary,4,21 June 2018,"The dictionary definition of ""hereditary"" is: passing, or capable of passing, naturally from parent to offspring through the genes, this was advertised and hyped up as ""the most terrifying film of the year"", I was certainly hoping it would be, especially after seeing the unnerving A Quiet Place only two months before. Basically Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is a miniaturist artist, she lives with her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), their teenage son Peter (Alex Wolff), and their thirteen-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Her mother Ellen has passed away, at the funeral Annie delivers a eulogy explaining her fraught relationship with her mother, who was extremely secretive. Annie thinks she sees the ghost of Ellen in her workshop, soon after she attends a support group for those who have lost loved ones, she reveals that many of her family, including Ellen, suffered from mental illnesses. Days later, Charlie is at school not focusing on a quiz in class, a pigeon suddenly flies into a window startling the class, during break she takes a pair of scissors and cuts the head off the pigeon, taking the head with her. Meanwhile, Peter is struggling in high school and is more interested in girls and pot smoking than his classes. Later, Peter is invited to a party, he lies to Annie that it is a school event, she forces him to take Charlie with him. Charlie is allergic to nuts, during the party she eats a piece of chocolate cake, not realizing it contains nuts, she goes into anaphylactic shock, Peter is high on marijuana and attempts to rush her to hospital. On the way, Charlie opens the window and partially climbs out to get some air, when Peter swerves to avoid a dead animal in the road, Charlie is decapitated when she collides with a telephone pole, it has a symbol written in blood on it. Peter drives home in shock without informing the parents, they discover Charlie's body in the morning. The family grieves terribly, and tensions build between Annie and Peter, it seems Peter is suffering from some form of PTSD, he begins hallucinating Charlie's ghost in the house. Annie returns to the support group, she is approached by mysterious fellow member Joan (The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd). Visiting Joan's apartment, Annie reveals she used to sleepwalk and recounts an incident where she woke up in Peter's bedroom, he was covered in paint thinner and she was holding matches, this is why he no longer trusts her. Joan tells Annie that she has learned to communicate with her deceased grandson through a séance, she convinces Annie to participate, showing her that the connection is real, she teaches her how to do it herself. Annie has a nightmare in which she revealed to Peter she purposely attempted to miscarry him while she was pregnant, after this she convinces her family to attempt a séance. But the séance goes wrong when a glass cabinet is smashed, and Annie is seemingly possessed by Charlie, Steve throws a glass of water on her and the possession ends. Annie suspects Charlie's spirit has become malevolent, so she throws her daughter's sketchbook into the fireplace, only for her arm to catch fire, she takes it off. Annie later goes to see Joan for advice, who is not at her apartment, so she next goes through her mother's belongings, finding a book Ellen highlighted with a section about the demon Paimon, a ""king of Hell"" who inhabits the bodies of vulnerable males. Annie next looks in the attic, she finds a decapitated corpse she believes to be Ellen, with a symbol written in blood, like what appeared on the telephone pole that killed Charlie. Meanwhile, Peter sees Joan calling to him across the street during lunch, he appears to become possessed during class, smashing his own head on the desk. Annie shows Steve her mother's body and the sketchbook, she begs him to burn it, he refuses and believes she has lost her mind, she throws the sketchbook onto the fire herself, only for Steve to immediately catch fire and burn to death. Annie is then seemingly possessed by Paimon, Peter awakens, finds his father's dead body, and is chased by a possessed Annie into the attic. A group of Ellen's followers confront Peter, then Annie appears in the rafters, beheading herself with wire garrotte, then many naked cult members flash up in the darkness. Unable to take anymore, Peter throws himself out of the window, he is knocked unconscious, a pulsing light appears to enter Peter's body and he wakes. Peter follows Annie's 's levitating corpse into the family tree house, where he finds Charlie's crowned, decapitated head resting atop a hand-made statue while Joan, other members of the coven, and the headless corpses of his mother and grandmother bow to him. Joan greets him as both Charlie and Paimon, declaring him as their ruler, Peter stares despondently after being crowned by Joan and the people around are worshipping him, and the final shot sees this scene in miniature model form. Also starring Christy Summerhays as Charlie's Teacher, Morgan Lund as Mr. Davis, Mallory Bechtel as Bridget and Jake Brown as Brendan. Collette is good looking despondent and scared, Byrne doesn't do as much apart from looked concerned sometimes, Wolff gets many of the memorable moments, and Shapiro is good at looking creepy. There is certainly a feeling of creepiness and some tension throughout the film, with some good scary music by Colin Stetson, but there were no real jump scares, just bizarre over-the-top moments, bloody and some just plain weird moments, I was hoping to be more thrilled, but by the end I was like ""what was all that about?"", I don't know why critics are giving such high praise, an average but watchable supernatural horror. Okay, in my opinion!",Hereditary
8,BA_Harrison,I couldn't relate.,3,7 October 2018,"Horror films are supposed to create a sense of dread, deliver scares or gross the viewer out: Hereditary did none of these things for me. I spent over two hours watching a simple tale play out at a snail's pace and became very bored in the process. Save for the 'accident' that sees little girl Charlie (Milly Shapiro) losing her head, there's very little of note that happens until the big reveal at the end, which really doesn't come as that much of a surprise (watch Rosemary's Baby, The Wicker Man, and Race With the Devil to see how to do this kind of thing properly).Judging by the reviews here on IMDb, Hereditary is very much a Marmite movie, but I fail to understand what its supporters are so fascinated by. Several questionable plot points alone make this a failure in my book (seriously, who would drive off leaving their sister's head on the roadside?). I put it on a par with production company A24's other slow-burn horror The Witch, which also left me scratching my head wondering what all the fuss was about (at least I could understand what they were talking about in Hereditary, which is something I suppose).",Hereditary
9,BandSAboutMovies,Disappointment has a new name.,2,9 June 2018,"When I was a kid, my parents often discussed a movie that they had seen when they first started dating: The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. People had been talking about how amazing the film was and when they went, they sat there confused and upset in the theater. For years, any time they rated a movie as boring, too strange or overly hyped, they would reference Argento's film. I always wondered if it upsets them that I grew up loving horror and giallo films so much.One day, I explained what I thought that movie was about to my parents. There's gender reversal, as well as being a foreigner and the isolation of modern life, filtered through the lens of an auteur. Maybe it didn't all make sense to him, but I think my explanation made them get a little more of why I liked it so much.My wife and I are planning on having kids some day. If one of them ever sits me down and explains why this movie is good to me, I'm going to disown them.If you thought movies like The Witch moved slowly, the glacial pace of this film makes that film seem like a slam-bang Honk Kong action pic. It takes forever to decide on what the movie is even about, smashing our expectations and killing off a major character - again, let me reinforce that spoiler warning - when Charlie goes to a party, has an allergic reaction and is beheaded while her brother races to get her to the hospital.That was the one true surprise of the film, one that made me think that it was getting ready to gear up and deliver on its promise to be the scariest movie of our generation.Look - I'm not going to deny the talent of the people involved in the film. Toni Collette is an amazing actress and she imbues the mother of this film with true emotion. It's as if her parts of this film seem to be a drama about dealing with loss and never truly understanding our parents and the gnarled roots of our family tree.While I was watching this film, a man snored loudly to my left and I wondered what magical dreams that he was having and how I could experience them instead of what was on the screen. I was jealous of the fact that his girlfriend allowed him the pleasures of dreamland while my wife continually poked me in the ribs to keep me awake during the slow opening of this film that then ground its gears to move even slower.Let's be perfectly frank. I hated this movie. It doesn't matter to me how many people love it or proclaim it as high art or say that it's the scariest movie they've seen and how much it haunts them. That's great - I'm happy that they had such a reaction to it. My reaction differs and I'm willing to sit down and ponder for nearly three times the length of this film exactly what I have to say about it. And that, I guess, is something of a success for this movie. Films should make you think and consider and examine. And this movie certainly did that. It also made me wonder exactly what I'd chose to watch when I got home to exorcise its stink from consciousness.This movie is style over substance, an effort that tries to tell a story that has no character to root for or care about. We have no idea what they are battling against so we have no way to figure out how they can avoid the outcome. I feel like I wasted money on this film, which is rough yet I can get it back, but I also wasted so much time caring about it and watching it, which is something that I can never get back. It needs an editor that could have trimmed its various narratives into a better collective whole. It's like steak on steak on steak, covered with 19 kinds of steak sauce, all eaten slowly through a straw after someone else has methodically chewed it for you. And after all that, it tastes like offal.",Hereditary
10,Coventry,Scary? Tense? Even my six-year-old begs to differ...,3,8 November 2021,"I am really skeptical and wary towards (new) horror movies that are world-widely acclaimed and hyped as super-scary, genuinely disturbing and groundbreakingly original. From experience, I know they are usually none of that. I'd rather not watch these films, ever, but generally always end up seeing them because they just keep popping up in alleged ""best of"" lists, or in recommendations from friends (who obviously don't know anything about horror).""Hereditary"" truly is an embarrassment. The cover of the DVD-box is chock-full of (fake?) quotes from festivals and genre magazines, claiming this is the scariest horror movie in decades, but it's all humbug. Writer/director Ari Aster, as well as his entire cast and crew, seems honestly convinced he was making a genius and convoluted tale of the occult, but I've rarely seen such a slow-moving, derivative, dreadfully boring, and predictable snoozer. And what the plot? The plot isn't half as innovative or smart as it likes to believe. Recently I saw the obscure Aussie flick ""Alison's Birthday"", which handles more or less the same premise a lot more effectively. Anyone who has seen his/her share of 70s horror will know exactly where Ari Aster is heading towards to.If allowed, I would also like to rant a bit about the so-called genuine scariness of ""Hereditary"". This film is utterly weak in the suspense and shocks departments, and I can illustrate this via an anecdote. My six-year-old daughter walked in when I was watching, and she joined for the rest of the film because the girl Charlie (Milly Shapiro) caught her attention for looking ""weird"". Nothing that happened caused her to get upset, including the burning man or the possession in the classroom. Only the scene with the bizarre car accident, involving that same girl Charlie, evoked a slight ""Wow!"" from the lips of my six-year-old. Imagine the boredom her father went through.I'm definitely removing Ari Aster's name from my list of ""interesting directors to follow"". ""Midsommar"" looked good and had style, but ended up being an overlong and boring wannabe ""The Wicker Man"". Still, though, it was at least five times better than the giant ""Hereditary"" disappointment.",Hereditary
11,michaelRokeefe,Emotional terrorism,8,24 September 2018,"Creepy, taut and gripping. An emotional and comprehension rescue may be in order if you let yourself get deep in this traumatic thriller.

Reclusive in life, she haunts her clan in death with more than just occasional, vague unease.

12,Hey_Sweden,An interesting horror film. A cut above the norm for modern fright fare.,7,23 June 2021,"The death of a family matriarch serves as the catalyst for strained occurrences within a highly dysfunctional family. Annie (an excellent Toni Collette) is a professional diorama creator and outsider in her own family. She's clearly a troubled individual, and becomes even more so when an unspeakable tragedy takes place. After a seance, she becomes determined to contact her loved one, and she eventually learns that there's some sort of sinister plot afoot involving her late mother.Right from the start, it's clear that this won't be to all tastes. Debuting writer / director Ari Aster goes for an uncommon thing in this day and age: the ""slow burn"". His pace is so measured that impatient viewers will likely tune out of this one early on. Some people may also find Collettes' histrionics a bit much, but there's no denying that she commits 100% to this character she's playing. ""Hereditary"", on the whole, has a *very* grim, oppressive atmosphere; after that devastating turn of events around the 34 minute mark, things just keep getting darker and darker.Aster gives his film some fairly potent visual gimmicks and imagery, and parcels out bits of gore here and there. But this film, which goes on quite long for this sort of thing (clocking in at two hours and eight minutes) adds some depth to what might have been a familiar set-up by making its first half a character study / heavy drama, detailing how people either cope or can't cope after a tragedy.Shapiro is well cast, and Wolff does a decent job although he really isn't the greatest at screaming or fake-crying. At first, the film seems like an egregious waste of able veteran Gabriel Byrne, but he gets more to do as the story plays out, portraying a husband / father who keeps getting faced with insanity within his family. Ann Dowd is good as a new friend who introduces Annie to the supernatural in order to kick off the films' second half.The resolution, however, may come as a disappointment to some people given how effective all the set-up is; this can unfortunately sometimes happen with films that take this approach. But this viewer wasn't really bothered by it.Seven out of 10.",Hereditary

14,neil-476,Disturbing rather than horrifying,8,18 June 2018,"Annie, who lives with husband Steve, dope smoking son Pete and weird 13-year old daughter Charlie, finds her life goes to pieces after her secretive mother dies. But in amongst the rel-life tragedy, how much is grief, how much is mental problems, and how much is something else entirely.This horror film isn't really very horrifying at all. However, some horrible things happen in, and it is genuinely disturbing which, in my book, makes it rather better than loud sound cues to make you jump.All the cast are good, with Toni Collette outstanding. Alex Wolff (Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle) does well with the troubled Pete, and Mille Shapiro as Charlie adds to the sense of unease by having a look about her of being not quite right. Only Gabriel Byrne draws the short straw in the necessary but rather thankless role of Steve.Giving any further information would spoiler the crawling sense of something indefinable being wrong. This is a good contribution to the genre, and worth your time if you have a taste for the macabre and unsettling.",Hereditary
15,view_and_review,Slow build up then BAM!,8,8 July 2018,"This movie was triiiiiiipy. I went into this movie totally blind--I didn't know what it was about, who was in it, or even the genre. I don't want to say I was confused, but I did have questions about where the movie was going in the beginning. The movie begins with Annie (Toni Collette) quasi-grieving the loss of her mother. It's clear they didn't have the best relationship and it's clear that her mother had some skeletons in the closet. Annie's husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), is a supportive good husband. Her son, Peter (Alex Wolff), seems OK except he likes to get stoned. Her daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), is truly the odd duck. It's enough for her to be considered strange that she's thirteen and looks like she just lost her front tooth and she likes to cluck like a hen; except it doesn't end with that.For the first hour of the movie all you know is that something is not right with the family. In that first hour a few key things occur--important and shocking enough to keep you in-tuned but still not informational enough to let you know what's coming next. Then, in the last hour is when I was at the edge of my seat, then gripping the armrests, then mentally preparing myself to be spooked to death. The last hour was a rollercoaster. This little sleeper of a movie was terrific, a great addition to the horror genre.",Hereditary
16,evanston_dad,Give Toni Collette an Oscar Please,8,10 October 2018,"Toni Collette, one of the best actresses currently in the business, is giving one of the best performances of the year in this high-strung horror movie.She plays the deeply troubled matriarch of a disintegrating family, struggling against a legacy of possibly inherited mental illness as well as her own unresolved feelings about the death of her mother and her maternal inadequacies. Things are already looking fairly bleak for this family when an unimaginable tragedy occurs, hastening the downward spiral of Collette's character. But she finds solace when she's befriended by a woman who's into spiritualism and who teaches Collette how to commune with the dead. That's when the proverbial poop really hits the fan.""Hereditary"" belongs to that sub-genre of horror movies currently in vogue and that includes films like ""The Babadook,"" ""The Witch,"" and ""It Follows,"" where the scares can all be accepted at face value or viewed as stand ins for bigger emotions and themes. In ""Hereditary,"" the horror that unfolds is as much about grief and the ever-present fear mothers have that they're failing their families in some way as it is about any of the literal things happening on screen. Indeed, as the movie gets closer to its conclusion, and the filmmakers feel more obligated to explain all the mystery, the film gets less scary. No, for me the two scariest moments in the film are monologues delivered by Toni Collette, one to a grief support group in which she elaborates on the history of her family, and the other a confession she makes to a friend about her feelings about her children. Both are bone chilling, and far scarier than the more traditionally scary things that occur later in the film. The unexplored terrain of the human mind will always be more frightening to me than any supernatural oogie boogies.And shout out to Ann Dowd as the spiritualist friend, who's friendly as can be in all of her scenes but nevertheless leaves the impression of having been terrifying. She's hot on your heels, Ruth Gordon.Grade: A-",Hereditary
17,ferguson-6,clever storytelling for a horror film,7,2 July 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. I will forever carry this flame of hope for quality horror films since they were such a part of my childhood movie watching. It's such an odd genre because the really good ones are quite rare, but the category in general is quite profitable. We enjoy being frightened and stressed ... in the safety of a dark movie theatre with a few dozen fellow movie goers. This debut feature film from writer/director Ari Aster is filled with foreboding and dread - key elements to a successful horror film.The clever filmmaker spends the first portion of the movie tricking/manipulating us into thinking this is going to be a ""normal"" ghost story - one we've seen before, albeit with a stronger than usual cast. Time and again I found myself thinking ""this poor family"". Toni Collette plays Annie, mother of son Peter (Alex Wolff, brother to Nat and son of Polly Draper) and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and wife of Steve (Gabriel Byrne). Some scenes are loaded with realistic family banter - the kind that's a bit passive-aggressive and judgmental in tone. This adds to the unsettling mood of dread that cloaks most of the characters and most every scene.Annie is an artist who creates miniature settings, and once she unloads her family history on an unsuspecting group therapy session, we are provided a big clue, as well as confirmation that the bad times aren't over. When tragedy strikes again, the family seems beyond repair, as do the individuals. Peter is a seemingly normal teenage boy who likes to smoke weed, and dutifully lets his little (and slightly disturbed) sister Charlie tag along to a party since his mother asked. Ms. Shapiro is a revolution in the role - somehow simultaneously both creepy and sympathetic. Father and husband Steve is very patient, a trait that rarely pays off in horror films. The family house makes for a terrific setting, especially considering the impressive treehouse that seems to always require a space heater. Ms. Collette fully commits to the role with all its grief and terror. It's really her performance combined with a creative story that harkens back to THE EXORCIST and ROSEMARY'S BABY, that allow the film to click. By the end, this family only wishes they were in a ""normal"" ghost story. And as a reminder, if you are born into a family where one member has a sleep-walking incident similar to what's described here, you have every right to lock your door before going to sleep - that is, assuming you could ever sleep again.",Hereditary
18,trashgang,nothing scary,7,3 July 2018,"And so I fell into the trap laid by promotion about people running out of theaters and people vomiting. I mean, I have seen over thousands of horrors so this one better be good to give me the creeps. And even in my country it was stated as the flick were people were fainting and crew of theaters had to be aware and had to say to attend the people watching. Once the flick was over I had a ripped-off feeling. Nothing is scary by ways that you would vomit. There's no gore at all, okay, there's a severed head and decapitations and so on but overall on part of a bloody mess it never shows. It's a slow starter and it takes almost over an hour before the horror comes in. Being compared and stated as the new Exorcist I'll be fare, no Exorcist (1973) is more scary. On the other hand I found it better than the overhyped Insidious franchise. What the movie does by using industrial sounds as score is giving it a rare feeling, and on that part the movie works. Still, there were teens attending the movie and they did scream loud. well promoted, mediocre horror flick. And if you want to vomit and being iritated by a uncomfortable feeling go watch Irreversible (2002) were people really ran out due the 9 minute rape scene and the notorious head smashing or go one step further with A Serbian Film (2010).

19,deloudelouvain,I'm still waiting for the disturbing scenes.,6,4 January 2020,"If I have to be absolutely honest I'm a bit disappointed by Hereditary. Just because it's another horror movie that has been overhyped, telling us that people had to leave the theater because it was too much for them, reading reviews it's the scariest and most disturbing horror movie ever etc... Let's just be honest, disturbing movies are A Serbian Movie, Hostel or The Human Centipede for exemple, those are all disturbing movies and hard to watch. Hereditary on the other hand is just a normal horror movie, not a bad one, but certainly not one I will think about in the future when somebody asks me what movie was sickening to watch. I like Toni Collette, she's perfect for her character. Overall the cast was good, the suspense building was maybe a bit too long without anything happening, certainly if you promote this movie like almost unwatchable because of the disturbing horror. Hereditary isn't a bad movie, I would probably have scored it a seven if there was not all that false advertisement.",Hereditary
20,christopher-underwood,This is fairly engaging,7,2 May 2019,"This is fairly engaging but the rather drawn out beginning and first half with its stop/start manner had me thinking I was watching some multi part TV series where the writers were only too aware this was something they needed to spin out. The kids are okay, the mother far too manic and Gabriel Byrne as the laid back and largely irrelevant father, far too lethargic and inexpressive. I was struck, however, having coincidently only seen him in the night before in Miller's Crossing in his prime, he maybe always had the feeling that one expression would probably do. Here he appears more dead than some of the actual dead but perhaps that is intended. All is not overly explained and on IMDb where there are usually one or two questions posed apropos certain films, for Hereditary there are dozens. Someone has gone to a lot of trouble dealing with them all but surely the film itself should take some responsibility for clarity. As it happens, for me, the overlong first half or so was engaging enough but as the 'happenings' began to take place I felt somewhat let down considering how long the build up had been.",Hereditary
21,Hellmant,So well made that it will leave you creeped out and disturbed for days!,10,15 June 2018,"'HEREDITARY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed horror flick about a family that begins to experience supernatural hauntings, after the death of their estranged grandmother. The film was written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Ari Aster, and it stars Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Milly Shapiro and Ann Dowd. The movie is a modest hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics. I absolutely loved it!After the death of their reclusive grandmother, the Graham family begins having disturbing (and quite terrifying) experiences. They also learn more about their mysterious ancestry, as depression sets more and more in for some. Severe mental illness also begins to cause havoc for the Graham family, especially for the mother, Annie Graham (Collette). The shocking death of yet another family member soon leaves Annie at a mental breaking point too, and the rest of the family begins feeling haunted as well.The film is one of those hauntingly memorable horror flicks, that's so well made that it will leave you creeped out and disturbed for days after you leave the theater (at least if you're someone that's sensitive like me). I love horror films, and I really respect a movie that can make me feel this way. The climax and the ending of the film are so classic, and masterfully effective, that I ultimately had to give the movie the highest rating possible as well. Collette also gives one of the best performances of the year so far too. The film truly is a must see for any die-hard horror fan, or just a movie lover in general as well!",Hereditary
22,thesar-2,Going in Cold,9,3 September 2018,"Do as I did: If you haven't seen this, stop now, rent/buy this movie and watch it as cold as possible. Can't ask for a much better movie-going experience.Well, and then, come back and enjoy my review. :-)Yep, one of my favorite ways to go into a movie is: COMPLETELY COLD. Not hearing anything, not who stars in the movie, the basic plot, hell, not even the subgenre, if it's divided. Someone recommended this to me months ago and now that it's available for home viewing, I finally got to see it.These past few months haven't been easy to live in the dark surrounding the movie because...people like to talk. What they don't see as a spoiler is darn well a spoiler for someone like me that doesn't ever want to see trailers because, again, I like to go in stone cold and just on a recommendation from someone.Whew! I severely digress. Back to the movie. Since I already gave the disclaimer up front, I can freely talk about the movie. Though, with as little revealed as possible.As the title suggests, things are passed on in this overly melancholy family. In the beginning, the grandmother dies and leaves the Mom/Dad, Daughter/Son family the main focus, and actually two more than others. But, bam! Just when you thought it was safe to go down the path of normal horror, the tides shift and more misery emerges.Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this movie for the majority of it. I thought the performances were too over the top, the family was obscenely creepy and the drama was thick enough to cut with a knife. And then...Things began to open my eyes and more and more revealed to drop my jaw. And sadly, it's only then that you realize that they've given you so many clues in this supposedly slow-burn mystery that you almost feel stupid for not picking up on everything. And then we have the climax.I loved it and it tied in everything so joyfully, this is definitely one of my favorite horror movies in a while and probably for 2018 for sure. It demands repeat viewings and I sure as HELL can't wait to see it again. IF you took my warning up front seriously and managed to avoid the hype, the spoilers, the reviews including this one, and watched and enjoyed it, bravo. I hope you had such an incredible experience as I did and wish they made more horror movies like this and not the cookie-cutter-conjuring ghost stories of late. THIS IS ORIGINALITY and I crave it more than any sh]t-storm Hollywood spits out just to make a buck.***Final thoughts: I was actually going to rewatch the entire movie a second time (and will do so, anyways) before writing my review. But, I watched enough ""Ending/Movie explained"" and ""Movie Review"" YouTube videos that I pretty much saw the movie a second time anyways. If you missed anything in the movie or felt this isn't as great as I'm portraying it to be, feel free to watch said YouTube videos. They'll probably convince you: You're Wrong, This Movie is GREAT!",Hereditary

24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Well made, acted and fairly unnerving, but a tough one to get your head around",7,20 June 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAnnie (Toni Collette) has recently lost her mother, a cold, distant woman who seemed to have something to hide. After attending a session for those struggling with loss, she reveals a long history of tragedy that has plagued her family line, only to then suffer one of the worst tragedies imaginable. After becoming friends with a lady at the sessions, Annie becomes obsessed with channelling the after-life, leading to husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) to question her sanity. But something much more creepy and sinister is at play...Horror is a genre that's become pretty generic and production line, a less demanding modern audience drip fed an endless succession of jump scare laden, soulless pap that pretty much matches their senses. It's much rarer nowadays to get something that aims to get under the skin and psychologically unnerve you and wear you out. So, if nothing else, it's kudos to director Ari Lester, here making his feature length debut, that he has at least attempted to produce something that is unconventional and at least tries to go somewhere new. But, sadly, Hereditary is something that doesn't pull it all off swimmingly. At least, not on the first viewing.It's certainly received loads of really great reviews, from professional film critics and other IMDb users, although there's been a fraction of that who have shared less praise-worthy ones, so it's nice not to feel like you're the one stupid one who 'just didn't get it.' What works about it is really great, as it successfully creates a genuinely unnerving, unsettling atmosphere, with it's drained camera style, and long, lingering camera lenses, that create a desperately solitary effect. Lead star Collette's performance is also amazing, as a woman whose life has been one long storybook of misery, perfectly conveying scenes of horror, grief, anguish and anger, although Byrne as her husband feels a little underdeveloped. The problem is, it all feels cobbled together in a sloppy, messy way, an already unclear and ambiguous story that ends up suffering from pacing issues as a result.Fans of the film Don't Look Now might find appeal in this one, a film where your own imagination's conclusion of events is as accurate as what's actually happened. It has too much going for it not to work, but it's one you may have to watch twice in order to get it and really pick everything up. That's another type of film they don't make so much of these days...***",Hereditary
25,MOscarbradley,One of the best horror films in years,8,1 July 2018,"""Get Out"" made horror films respectable again, or at least Oscar-friendly again, in a way they hadn't been since ""The Exorcist"". I've seen Ari Aster's terrific feature debut ""Hereditary"" compared to ""The Exorcist"" or at least mentioned in the same sentence. Possession, of a kind, and a grieving mother are the only tenuous links I could make out but like ""The Exorcist"" I can see ""Hereditary"" picking up a slew of Oscar nominations next year; Toni Collette is virtually a shoo-in for her magnificent performance as the beleagured mother and it's actually the better film.Indeed for the first hour or so I wouldn't have called ""Hereditary"" a 'horror' film at all but a serious and deeply disquieting study of a woman cut off from her family by grief. When it does change midway through the jolt is sudden and hardly subtle but the effect is considerable. If, in the end, this is 'just' another horror film it's still pretty damn scary with the emphasis on jump-in-your-seat scares and a real sense of dread rather than guts and gore. I'm sure there must have been horror films as effective as this or more so since that Exorcist guy did what he had to do to get the devil out of Regan but this is still a superior frightener, very well written and directed by novice Aster and beautifully played by everyone with Collette and Ann Dowd outstanding.Fans of the genre will find much to savour here though personally I think I would have been happier if the film had stuck to its original path and jettisoned any hint of the supernatural. I enjoyed it hugely; I just didn't take it very seriously nor will I ever listen to Joni Mitchell's song 'Both Sides Now' quite in the same light again.",Hereditary
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"The more I think about it, the less I like it.",5,21 June 2018,"The first two thirds of 'Hereditary (2018)' are essentially a drama that deal with poignant themes of grief and the accompanying guilt using a horror genre language, which is an interesting move that allows for a unique expression of the severity of these emotions. It is these moments that are the most effective as they tap into a universal fear and experience in a really realistic way that isn't necessarily used to frighten but is used to create emotional attachment to the characters and may perhaps illicit a genuine emotional response. Yet, I can't easily name another movie that falls apart so heavily thanks solely due to its ending, which intends to 'pull the rug out' from under its audience - and does so successfully - but comes at the cost of logic, investment and, most importantly, scariness. Instead of recontextualising the flick as one that embraces its new elements and intended reading in retrospect, it forces in nonsensical and previously unconsidered elements - via clunky exposition, no less - to frustrating, and sometimes unintentionally funny, effect. It honestly changes the entire affair for the worse, dampening the effect of all that came before it until the memory of any success all but fades. It's annoying, too, because the potential was there and I was definitely willing to put the effort in, eager to delve into the experience with an open mind and a watchful eye. I found my willingness to approach the film from an intellectual stand-point, as well as to give it the benefit of the doubt on a number of occasions, not to be rewarded, to say the least. The more I think about the picture, the less I like it. 5/10",Hereditary
27,bowmanblue,The ultimate in 'slow burning' horror,7,11 March 2019,"I'd heard quite a lot about 'Hereditary' before I actually watched it, most of which stating that, although marketed as a 'horror' movie, it wasn't so straight forward. Now, having sat through it, I can - sort of - see what they mean.When you think of 'horror' you probably imagine monsters, slashers or something similar. Now, although 'Hereditary' definitely has a strong supernatural element running through it (not to mention some pretty disturbing imagery which I would definitely describe as 'horrific!), it's certainly not your average run-of-the-mill horror.When questioned, even the film-makers go to great lengths to describe it as more of a 'family drama' (plus supernatural, etc). It weighs in at just over two hours, which is certainly longer than your average tale about a guy in an ice hockey mask slicing up teenagers. Instead, we have a story about what, on the surface could be described as a 'traditional' family of four (Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne as the mother and father and Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro as their children) and the way they're coming to terms with the recent loss of the grandmother of the household.It's certainly a 'character-focused' piece and all four (or at least three - I did feel that Gabriel Byrne was given the least to do of the four) major characters get their chance to shine and also develop. We see how the death of the 'matriarch' affects them all and their dynamic, plus the problems her loss causes among them. For the most part, what 'horror' is displayed is due to their various mental breakdowns and how they see things (although there is one particularly graphic scene - only for a second or two - which will stay with me forever). Any supernatural threat comes in the final act when the weird stuff really starts going down.It was certainly nice to see a horror movie try to be a little different and I felt compelled to watch it to the end, simply to see where it was going and, perhaps more importantly, what the hell was going on! Yes, it's not completely black and white and the story does make you work for a few answers here and there. I even went as far as to watch a YouTube video on its 'ending explained' just to make sure I had actually understood it (and I'm pleased to say that I had!).If it has a fault (for me, anyway) then it's the film's run-time. Yes, it does do a good job of building tension, however I did feel I'd like to get to the 'meat' of the story a little quicker than I actually did. However, that's just a minor gripe and there were more than enough shocks and surprises that I never saw coming (and I've seen a lot of horror films!) which made the (long) journey worthwhile. If you're in the mood for something long, drawn out and a little different in terms of horror, then it's definitely worth sitting down for.",Hereditary
28,ThomasDrufke,"Unsettling But Far From ""Scary""",7,21 June 2018,"After much scrutiny came down on A24 for releasing the 'misleading"" 'It Comes Out at Night' last year, another critically acclaimed horror film hit theaters, 'Hereditary'. This one, about an extremely unlucky or perhaps cursed family, which life unravels for after the grandmother passes away. In many ways, Hereditary is a strikingly bold drama with fantastic performances. However, in others, it's a disappointingly un-scary horror. I fall somewhere in between these two fronts. The performances are definitely something to behold, particularly Toni Collette, who very well may have given an Oscar worthy turn as a loving but troubled mother of two, as well as Alex Wolff's haunting turn as her son. This movie contains perhaps a few of the most unsettling things I have ever seen on screen, including a prolonged scene involving a car and Alex Wolff that has to be the most impressive scene without any dialogue I've seen in 2018. But with all that said, the movie turns into something in the 3rd act that I hoped the film was going to avoid but ended up falling right into. Of course, a director and writer's vision should go where they want it to go, and A24 has always done a great job of providing the filmmakers with the path to execute their specific vision. But I was really wanting the film to go a certain way, and when it didn't and took (in my opinion, a more predictable and cliched approach), I was disappointed. Sometimes all it takes is a film to separate from your expectations for it to bum you out. Hereditary is a well-made film with some real horror and Oscar worthy performances, but it's moreso a drama that dips into cliched horror towards the end of the movie. I hate comparing two completely different movies, but The Witch is a far better option.7.0/10",Hereditary
29,Cineanalyst,"Mommy Sees Dead People, Too",3,28 September 2018,"One may debate the merits of the term ""elevated horror,"" as it suggests that horror is otherwise inferior to other genres if not ""elevated,"" but I think that word could just as well be placed in front of any movie that surpasses expectations of a genre piece. Regardless, it fit ""Get Out"" (2017) which was ""elevated"" by its satire--reworking standard horror elements to tap into the zeitgeist of racial issues at the end of the Obama era. I'd even accept the moniker for ""A Quiet Place"" (2018) under an interpretation such as Richard Brody's for the ""New Yorker"" magazine that it's the antithesis of ""Get Out."" It need not be political, either. For this purpose, I'd consider horror films that introduce innovations in style or narrative structure to be ""elevated"" (""Psycho"" (1960), ""The Shining"" (1980), ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) come to mind as obvious major influences in the genre). Even ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) had its twist. Otherwise, without being ""elevated,"" you just get a scary story, and it either works on you on a physical level or it doesn't. Unfortunately, that's what ""Hereditary"" does.It's a simple ghost story. The revelation of some details are delayed, but they're heavily foreshadowed, so I don't see why anyone would consider the ending surprising or a betrayal except that for all of its good reviews and talk about a new era of ""elevated horror"" its surprise is that there's nothing more to it. Of course, there's some drama (in this case, regarding dysfunctional family dynamics and the loss of loved ones); there almost always is. But, then, it's just strange-looking kids, apparitions, séances, grave desecration, cults, supernatural happenings and jump scares from there. The usual clichés. It also follows the basic complex discovery plot, as outlined by film theorist Noël Carroll (see e.g. ""Interpreting the Moving Image""): Onset, Discovery, Confirmation and Confrontation. The Onset is where we the audience begin to become aware there's a monster--for instance, an apparition is seen here and there and we learn about the dark past of a dead mother. Discovery is when the mother played by Toni Collette discovers there's a monster, too. In the Confirmation phase, she tries to convince others, to confirm, the existence of the monster. And, then, Confrontation, of course, is what it sounds like. This has been the most common plot of horror movies since the genre was largely introduced in Hollywood with the 1931 ""Dracula.""Too bad, too. I was hoping for more, especially with the business of replica (haunted) houses--the mother's dollhouses, the kid's tree house--and the casting of Toni Collette, who also played the mother in ""The Sixth Sense."" Something self-reflexive, perhaps, or something reflecting the multi-layering of houses and planes of existence. Yet, at best, ""Hereditary"" is merely a better-crafted replica of a formula and conventions that continue to haunt the genre.",Hereditary

Tony Colette is outstanding, and Milly Shapiro as the daughter has the perfect look for the film. Somehow though it didn't quite stick the landing, which just seemed simplistic and a bit of a letdown, especially based on the film's hype.

This horror film is not unsettling because of gore or other typical horror elements, it is difficult to watch due to the mental and psychological implications. The acting is so incredible that you actually feel the pain with the characters (and I'm again not referring to physical pain). Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro and Alex Wolff were so good, it felt like watching real life unfold in front of your very eyes. Alex Wolff in particular was astonishingly good after the unexpected car accident that shocked me so intensely that I literally froze, and paused the film to contemplate what just happened. Gabriel Byrne is a brilliant actor, but he wasn't really given much to do in this film, as he was the only one trying to keep it (and the family) together. He was very reserved, but still played a vital role. His character was in direct contrast to the rest of his family.The film is very, very well made and very realistic. The film gets more surreal towards the end, but remains stylish and effective. The ending might be a bit confusing and therefore deserves more viewings so you can pay attention to all the details that actually forewarn you what is to come (but you'll only take notice of this once you've seen the ending).

It is a bit artsy, creepy, and disturbing. The cast delivers a great performance, the plot can be slow moving. It does have that slow set up. More similar to the horror movie set up like Rosemary's Baby. Sure, that is were the filmmakers are trying to aim for. I did not find the movie to be scary at all. But very creepy and disturbing feel. The less you know about the plot the better the reveal is. The plot follows Annie (Toni Collette). She is an artist to miniature models. Also, has a miniature models of a life story of her family and the situation with her sick mother. After her mother passes away. She barely knew much about her mother. Besides she has many friends and kept a very secretive life. After her passing, Annie, and her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), her son Peter (Alex Wolff), and Charlie (Milly Shapiro) start experiencing some unknown things. That begins happening around them. The plot is slow moving. So do expect a slow set up with the characters. Annie barely knew her mother. Her husband is a passive guy but tries to do what is best for their children. Peter feels like a black sheep with the family. And Charlie who is distant with the family, making tiny models, and is more of a loner type of child. The direction by Ari Aster delivers a sharp tone. The story is a slow set up. But slowly things do become a little weird. When they start seeing Annie's mother. People in that town act differently or weird. And there are strange symbols on light poles or on walls. Annie begins to feel like she is losing her mind. The set design is mainly consist of them being in Annie's house. When a creepy situation like someone hanging in a corner of a dark room is slowly lurking. It gets very uncomfortable. And there is plenty of more of those horror techniques when the film gets closer to the climax. Toni Collette is great as Annie. Her performance is through the roof amazing. Alex Wolff was also good too. Milly Shapiro playing a silent girl type is great. The cinematography was great in capturing this uncomfortable feeling. The film does get very disturbing when it reaches the climax. And the film does its job as a horror movie making you feel disturbed even after the movie. Without giving away any spoilers. Overall, Hereditary is a good horror film. It does not have much scares. It does have a creepy and disturbing direction. The acting is great. The direction and script delivers an uncomfortable setting. The plot is very slow moving with its pace. Which is were it may lose the audience. But the payoff was definitely worth it.",Hereditary
40,zkonedog,Creepy Images Are Never Enough On Their Own,3,10 June 2018,"One thing I've learned about horror/suspense flicks over the years is that creepy images alone are not enough to base the entire experience around. Sure, you can load a film with jump-scares and grisly images, but if there isn't an interesting or coherent plot to back it up, the entire experience will be transient (at best) and utterly forgettable (at worst). Unfortunately, the latter is very close to my feelings about ""Hereditary"".For a basic plot summary, this film begins with a family that is reeling from the death of the grandmother matriarch. Mother Annie (Toni Collette) doesn't quite know how to process her emotions, husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) just seems distant, while siblings Charlie (Milly Shapiro) & Peter (Alex Wolff) start displaying signs of odd behavior. When another tragedy rocks the family, the oddness quotient increases, leading Annie to take drastic measures to get to the bottom of what is actually transpiring.It's actually pretty easy for me to pinpoint exactly why I disliked this film so much: About halfway in, I knew it would ""all come down to the ending"", so to speak. Because not much time is devoted to really digging deep into the characters, this quickly turns into the type of movie that will be defined by what twist it can pull out of the bag before the credits roll. Sadly, that ends up being the weakest part of the film, essentially dooming the entire experience.I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, but I will just say this: you won't expect what happens in the end, but that doesn't turn out to be a good thing. It really feels like ""Hereditary"" had some forward momentum, and then only was able to tack on a mumbo-jumbo sort of ending to all of it. For 3/4 of the film, it teases viewers into thinking that ""all the clues are there...you just have to put them together"". That is most definitely NOT the case, as the ending is instead pulled so far out of left field that it might as well not even be in the ballpark.To be sure, there are some creepy images and jump-scares in ""Hereditary"", and that is the only reason I can even give it three stars here (it does put in some semblance of effort). Without a strong plot, and sunk by an even worse concept ending, though, it doesn't make a mark in any significant way.",Hereditary
41,eddie_baggins,"Disturbing and unsettling, Hereditary is a genuine classic",10,12 July 2018,"No doubts about it, whatever experience you think you're going to get from Hereditary or whatever you think Hereditary is, it's probably not, but where there are no doubt's is in the fact that Ari Aster's scarily good debut film is a modern day horror classic.A deeply disturbing and unsettling film, that crafts an ominous and dread filled environment from its opening frames until its unforgettable finale, Hereditary isn't your typical jump scare filled horror event, more so an incendiary, mentally mind melting offering that will crawl under your skin and stay there for days and weeks afterwards.Focusing on the Graham family who are mourning (or celebrating?) the recent passing of their secretive grandmother Ellen, Aster's film introduces us to Toni Collette's miniature making mother Annie, Gabriel Bryne's kind-hearted therapist father Steve and Nat Wolff and Milly Shapiro's teenage children Peter and Charlie, as the slightly dysfunctional crew begin to find their lives taking some (lets we say odd) turns in the aftermath of Ellen's death.With this peculiar collection of souls, Aster has established a horror film family for the ages, that's impressively played by all performers, with Australia's own Toni Collette delivering a career best and award's worthy turn as the mentally unhinged Annie, whose life has been anything but ordinary.With Collette's Annie and Shapiro's downright unnerving Charlie at the forefront, Aster builds a narrative that is slow burning in nature but utterly gripping from start to finish and it's the type of experience that is best watched as blind as possible to allow the viewer to absorb, and in many ways handle, the goings on.You know and understand from very early on that not all is as it seems in Aster's tale and it's a sustained feeling that pulls the rug out from under you on more than a few occasions, making you quickly understand that anything is possible in this unique and powerful creation.Combined with Pawel Pogorzelski brilliant cinematography and Colin Stetson's goose bump inducing score, Aster's debut is two hours of pure unadulterated tension and brilliance and it really can't be overstated just how impressive Aster's effort is here as a first-time director, marking him down instantly as one of the industry's brightest new talents.Final Say -There's so much that can be said about this stunning and hauntingly horrific tale and while arguably not for all tastes, for those that fall under Hereditary's spell, this is a cinematic experience not to be missed, with Aster's film one that is set to be talked about and picked a part for year's yet to come.5 chocolate cakes out of 5",Hereditary
42,leonblackwood,Enjoyed the first half but it went nuts towards the end. 5/10,5,31 December 2018,"Review:
After reading some good reviews about this film, I finally got to watch it and I must admit, I did find it pretty boring. The weird plot is well written but the ending was strange. Toni Collette puts in a brilliant performance, along with Gabriel Byrne who plays her husband Steve, but there are a lot of scenes that could have easily been taken out because they didn't lead to anything. I did like the deep bass notes throughout the movie, which gave it a mysterious, atmospheric tone and there are some shocking moments which makes the movie unique but it just didn't do it for me. Anyway, the movie starts off with Annie (Toni Collette) burying her mother with her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), son Peter (Alex Wolff) and young daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) Annie takes the death of her secretive mother pretty hard, so she seeks help through a support group for the bereaved. She then thinks she sees an apparition of her mother in her workshop, where she makes miniatures models, but she doesn't make anything of it. Peter then asks his mum to borrow the car to go to a friends party, but his mum will only give him the car if he takes Charlie with him. Charlie doesn't really like mingling with other people but she decides to go with her brother after her mother pushes her to go. Whilst at the party, Charlie eats cake containing nuts, which she is allergic to, and falls into anaphylactic shock which makes it hard for her to breathe. As Peter drives her to the hospital, Charlie leans out of the window for air but Peter swerves to avoid a dead dear and Charlie is decapitated by a telephone pole. In, shock, Peter silently drives home and leaves his sister's corpse in the car for their mother to discover the next morning. The death of Charlie puts a strain on Annie and Steve's marriage and causes tension between Annie and Peter. At the support group, Annie becomes friends with another member called Joan (Ann Dowd), who teaches Annie to perform a seance to communicate with Charlie. Back at home, Annie wakes from a nightmare and convinces her family to attempt the seance. Objects begin to move and break, terrifying Peter and Charlie, and Annie becomes possessed until Steve douses her with water. Annie suspects that Charlie's spirit has become malevolent, so she tried to get some advice from Joan, who has mysteriously vanished. Annie notices that Joan's welcome mat resembles her mother's craftwork, so she goes through her mother's possessions and finds a photo album which links Joan to her mother Ellen. The book also contains information about a demon named Paimon, who wishes to inhabit the body of a male host. In the attic, Annie finds Ellen's decapitated body with strange symbols on the wall written in blood. From here I was totally lost and confused. Although the whole movie seemed spooky and mysterious, I didn't have a clue about what was going on, and when Peter started to slam his head against his desk, I really didn't know what direction the rest of the film was going to go in. To make matters worse, Annie also becomes possessed and starts going nuts on Peter, and after she chops her own head off with piano wire, they all end up in Charlie's treehouse, with Peter becoming some sort of King. Anyway, from a supernatural/horror point of view, it's full suspense through the first half of the movie but the director seemed to have lost the plot towards the end. It does have it's good points, like the whole grieving process and the way that the family is torn apart because of Annie's founding but apart from that, I was lost towards the end. It's still worth a watch because of the great performances and the fact that you actually care about the characters but I was disappointed with the outcome. Average!Round-Up:
This is the first major release from director Ari Aster, so it's hard to compare his work to anything else. There isn't a planned sequel to this movie, even though Peter seems to have become some sort of king towards the end, but he must be impressed with the profit that it made at the box office. Although it wasn't my cup of tea, it was one of the big surprises for 2018, alongside A Quiet Place which was also in the same genre.Budget: $10million

43,TheMovieDiorama,Hereditary utilises visceral imagery from generational horror classics to create a modern interpretation.,8,15 June 2018,"This, was my most anticipated of the year. The colossal praise, intense trailer and positive buzz made me subconsciously more excited as its release day loomed. Does it live up to self-obtained titles such as ""this generation's 'The Exorcist'""? Unfortunately not. I've had time to ponder, and as much as I wanted to give it a perfect rating...I just couldn't. A family start to become haunted following the death of their matriarchal grandmother. I'm saying nothing else, go into this knowing nothing and you'll come out feeling confused, uneasy and breathless. This is emotional horror at its finest, substituting cheap jump scares for terrifying imagery where the dialogue and characters create the scares. Evoking themes of grief and loss, implementing them into a personal story where a motherly bond between her children is tested during a heightened state of mind. It's an audacious directorial debut from Aster, who manages to craft a bone-chilling drama subtly through slow camera movements and narrative tension. Toni Collette simply gives a career best performance. A scene involving an intense confrontation with her son showcases her commanding presence and emotional vulnerability. Wolff and Shapiro were also enigmatic. Cinematography was gorgeous, plenty of mentally scarring scenes and an abundance of skin crawling moments. For me, I was not keen on certain plot aspects and do believe there were a few misdirections, particularly towards its conclusion. Considering the intense first two acts, its finale came across as uninspired as it settles for a more supernaturally basic plot, leaving you wondering ""what the heck just happened?"". Keeping in mind the slow pace that these A24 horror films are known for, a 127 minute runtime was too long with certain sections experiencing dipped pacing, thus negating the built up tension. It is clear that this film is not for everyone, its arthouse aesthetic appeal will be too slow for many. However, it's a bleak horror film that is sure to leave its own legacy.",Hereditary
44,Tweetienator,A Strong One,8,1 January 2020,"I rewatched Hereditary lately and I can say this one grew on me - I even deleted my old review and took the task on me to write a new one. First of all Hereditary provides us a very good cast: Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Toni Collette and Milly Shapiro really act way above your average horror troupe. Second, the sound-design is an extremly disturbing and good one. Last but not least, we get some very strong and disturbing images and a very few but therefore far more powerful scenes of ""gore"". Some reviewer complain about the ending but in my opinion that ""peculiar"" ending is the sweet topping on the cake.

It's a dopey horror movie. It's seriousness drags the pacing way down. It's long running time doesn't help much either. It's at least twenty minutes too long. The actors try hard but are forced to walk around with pusses on their faces the entire movie. I normally enjoy Gabriel Byrne's work but not tonight. He seems to be asleep (literally) half of the movie and sleepwalking the other half. Toni Collette works her tail off. She must have gone home every night completely exhausted after filming.

48,southdavid,Headless Horseman,5,15 June 2018,"This is going to be a hard review. In another review I've posted, for ""Annihilation"", I talked about a fairly solid film that was undone by a catastrophic ending. ""Hereditary"" is almost the mirror opposite. Despite a gnawing sense of tension throughout the 90 minutes I think my most common sensation was one of boredom. Indeed there were some people leaving the Cinema during this time and not returning. However, what they missed was a gloriously insane last twenty five minutes, which almost, but if I am honest doesn't quite, make up for the journey to get there. The performances throughout are particularly strong though. Toni Colllette is great, Oscar worthy is a fair assessment, although I'm sure that as a genre film and length of time to next March will mean it's forgotten by then. Alex Wolff too is excellent and I particularly liked how he reverted to a younger child crying for his Mummy during the later scenes, it was a brave choice not to try and hold onto any cool detachment and just go for it. The film looks beautiful and the idea that Annie creates models of her house and of scenes from her life that interacts with actual sets of the movie works well (if that never actually pays off into the actual movie at all). The tension is slowly ratcheted up across those initial minutes, as the film toys with the idea that something supernatural is going on against the idea that mental illness or schizophrenia runs in this family and is affecting the grief that befalls them - but there's just too much of it... It goes on too long with family members either not sufficiently curious or deciding to get the hell out of the house, or away from each other, than is realistic. The music and sound design really feeds into this, with a low off putting buzzing adding to the sense of dread. Then there's the ending. I liked it. I expect that for some who weren't paying attention it does rather come out of nowhere and I too was with an audience that laughed at some of it but this gloriously OTT finale really worked for me. Enough to earn it two extra stars on my score.",Hereditary

As the movie opens, we get to know Annie and Steve, and their teenage kids Peter and Charlie, as they attend the funeral of Annie's mom Ellen. Annie is surprised at the many people attending the funeral that shoe doesn't know. It's clear that Annie and her mom didn't have the best relationship, and Annie doesn't feel too sad about her mom passing. Meanwhile Peter is wanting to attend a party at a friend's house. Annie agrees but forces him to take along his younger sister, with disastrous consequences... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut feature-length film of writer-director Ari Aster. He brings us a tale of spiritualism gone horribly awry, and that;s about all I can say without spoiling anything. Let me be upfront: if it weren't for the off-the-charts ratings (currently at 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), I would not have gone to see this. But curiosity got the better of me when I saw this near-universal critical acclaim. What I got was a horror movie that is certainly not bad, but neither is it the masterpiece that the critic makes this out to be, and in fact ""Hereditary"" is not nearly as good as some other recent, far more clever and original, horror movies such as ""Get Out"", ""A Quiet Place, ""or ""It Comes At Night"", just to name those. Kudos to Toni Colette, who is outstanding as Annie, making this movie feel more authentic that it actually is. Last but certainly not least, there is a terrific, one might say classic, score, and imagine my surprise when I saw in the end titles that the score is composed by Colin Stetson, wow! I will need to check out the score for sure.""Hereditary"" opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. In fact, the early box office reports are that the movie did better than expected/projected, grossing $13 mill (against a budget for a mere $10 mill).

52,jtindahouse,Almost works better as a drama than a horror,7,7 June 2018,"'Hereditary' is sort of like two films in one. Half of the time it is being what I expected it to be, which is a horror movie. The other half though it plays out much like a drama. I would even suggest it's a better film when it's in drama mode than it is when it's in horror mode. The film is over 2 hours in length which is extremely long by modern horror movie standards. The reason I believe for this is that it's trying to fit so much in and achieve so much in such a little time. It's a very ambitious film it would have to be said.The entire cast were terrific, but Toni Collette absolutely blew me away. The emotional depth she is able to achieve never ceases to amaze me and she is captivating to watch in any scene she's in. I feel like she is one of the most under-appreciated actresses working today. As mentioned though, everyone is terrific and this is one of the best acted horror movies you are likely to find.I sat in the cinema for a couple of minutes are the credits rolled just trying to work out how I actually felt about the film. I know I liked it, but I also know I didn't love it as much as I had hoped to going in. It certainly surprised me that I was more invested in the real-life drama side of things, and that the horror was almost like an unwanted distraction at times. The horror is almost always about atmosphere and visuals rather than any kind of jump-scare which I always like. What I didn't like though was how casually it jumped from seeming normality to outright suspension of belief. I feel like this could have been bridged a little better. Early on there's a lot of subtlety, then in one scene all of that is thrown out the window at once. I suppose at least the audience knows where they stand from that point onwards. 'Hereditary' is a film made with impeccable quality, of that there is no questioning. In fact it's made so well that I would suggest what story you picked to tell almost wouldn't matter because writer/director Ari Aster clearly has the skills to make it work. I can see opinions being very divided on the film (I even had a couple walk out of the cinema at one point in my showing), but I think the majority will like it on some level and for that reason I would recommend giving it a look.",Hereditary
53,Turfseer,No scares or thrills in this dopey tale of family possessed by the devil,3,7 December 2018,"It's called ""Hereditary,"" and if you have any appreciation for good cinema, you must avoid it like the plague. Created by a horror aficionado, first-time feature director Ari Aster, Hereditary has managed to garner an incredible ""87"" on Metacritic. Don't ask me for certain why this has come to pass, but usually such reviews can be tied to the mass of misguided critics who populate both the print and online media.
The film stars Australian actress Toni Collette, who plays a beleaguered artist-mother Annie Graham, presiding over a family of misfits including her 13 year old daughter Charlie, who appears to suffer from Asperger's Syndrome, and Peter, a disaffected 16 year old who spends a good deal of time smoking marijuana. There's also the passive husband, Steve, who doesn't have much of a plan for saving the family from demonic forces.
When we first meet Annie, she's attending the funeral of her mother with the rest of the family. It's later revealed that the grandmother was some sort of devil worshiper who is responsible for turning Charlie into the disturbed child whose problems no one can find a way to ameliorate.
When Charlie freaks out at a party frothing at the mouth, Peter, high on marijuana. tries to bring her to the hospital driving furiously down a darkened road in the family SUV. Unfortunately for all parties concerned, Charlie is decapitated when she sticks her head outside the window and is hit by an emerging telephone pole.
The abject stupidity of Aster's script becomes apparent when Annie discovers Charlie's headless body the next morning. One wonders what happened to the police investigation but no intrepid investigating detectives show up at the house and Peter is left depressed with his mother unable to control her anger toward him.
The plot has a mildly interesting twist when Annie befriends Joan, a woman she meets at a support group for parents of deceased children. Later Annie finds a scrapbook with pictures of Joan and her mother together in devil worshiping ceremonies.
Nothing much makes sense after that. When Steve throws the grandmother's scrapbook into the fire, he explodes into a ball of fire. Joan disappears and eventually Peter kills himself by jumping out the window of the house. Annie beheads herself with a piano wire, Peter's corpse is inhabited by a spirit and they all convene in Charlie's tree house, where Joan hails Peter as Paimon, one of the Devil's Princes. Women's liberation takes a backseat after Peter is hailed as the new prince--liberated from Charlie, whose decapitated corpse represents a female host.
The worst part of the film is there are really no likable characters, as they all eventually morph into disciples of the devil. The potential heroine, Annie, ends up like all the others in the family. I suppose horror films are supposed to scare you-this one will only make you laugh!!!!",Hereditary

It's more disturbing than anything, with near-constant upsetting material from the film's beginning. It's one of those movies where you aren't sure you want to keep watching... but you can't stop.

This is a horror movie that is more weird than scary. It has it's moments but then something will happen that just doesn't make sense. Toni & Gabriel are a married couple with two kids, Alex & Milly. Toni's mother dies after a long illness but most of the family members don't seem to care that much about their loss-Toni was estranged from her mother. The only one that got along with the elderly lady was Milly, and Milly is a little off herself-she likes to draw weird pictures, cut the heads off of dead birds and then put them in her pocket. Oh yeah, she also likes to make a strange clicking noise with her mouth. Oh yeah, the loosing heads bit is a recurring theme throughout the movie-more than one person looses their head before it's all over. Toni even goes to counseling to find out why she doesn't care about her mother and unravels past secrets that are being passed down through her and her family-I guess that hereditary issues are the hardest ones to correct.

58,parry_na,Enjoyable and delirious.,8,31 January 2019,"Of course you could, if you wanted to, lump much of 'Hereditary' in with the many other 'is there something supernatural afoot, or is it all in the mind' horror films that exist. But such is the slow-burning set-up, the very convincing performances and the assuredly weird direction (from Ari Aster, who also wrote this), that the resultant filmic experience is so much more.My favourite performance, in some impressive company, is that of young Alex Wolff as Peter, son of Steve and Annie Graham (Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette) and brother to poor Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Whilst Peter and his mother seem most susceptible to the demonic mischief going on, whilst Steve remains scared but sceptical, it is Peter who evokes most sympathy, even though he has a terrible guilty secret.Throughout this 127 minute experience, I made several attempts to pause the DVD to fix a drink. Such was the power of the film, it remained unfixed. Whilst his doesn't perhaps measure up to all the hype and positivity heaped upon it (it has been set alongside 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen'), it is nevertheless, an extraordinarily powerful and retrained horror story. Restrained because, for all the fevered emotion and tragically disintegrating personalities on display, there is relatively little gore or special effects. What there is, however, is exactly right.Al of these things push the finale into dizzying heights of surreal hellishness. If you have any interest in horror, and especially if you may find yourself disillusioned by much current popular horror output, this two hours will make you horrifically happy.",Hereditary
59,GiraffeDoor,Sterile,4,25 January 2020,"As Xena, Warrior Princess, once told me: ""if you ever see anything you can't quite explain, a cult did it"".I can admit that when I first reviewed this movie I was a bit over emotional. However, now that I have had some time to cool down, I've decided that I don't want to be too negative about it because I sincerely believe that this movie really did come from a good place creatively. They tried to not be just another conveyor belt horror. It was a story, not only of material conflict and external menaces but also of interpersonal problems; to really show that there is a lot to be feared in people's humanness as well as the apparently inhuman.But in addition to a lot of wrong notes, there is one major problem that ruins the movie: bad structuring. I feel that this could have been EITHER a gripping thriller of an unseen menace OR a chilling surrealist drama of a family falling apart, though a movie could certainly be both. But here they just distract from each other and the whole thing comes across as very fragmented which prevents the momentum which even a slow burn needs.Although it looks the part of a classy, original piece of dark fiction, it fails on several levels. I think because it is in denial about the type of movie it should be. If it had focused on being that dark paranormal family drama I think it would have so much more to give, but wrangling it into the horror genre just warped it into something it's not. As much as I would love to see an effective, character driven horror, this was never meant to be it. One feels that a ton of moments were just shoved in just for the creep factor and it just makes the tone risible rather than creepy.You will understand the conclusion of this movie; it's not esoteric. This movie is that unhappy medium between being way too slow and way too convoluted and yet far too upfront. By the end I am painfully aware of the situation but still scratching my head on small details and not in the fun way. A good horror is mysterious to be sure, but mysterious is the skilful presentation of information that makes me believe there is an answer waiting to be found. To be confusing you only need to bombard me with weirdness for the sake of weirdness which when you think about it is not really being weird at all.I think it wants to be Donnie Darko or something but it didn't actually have a story to tell. I think I understood what it's trying convey but like the works of Tolkien, I didn't feel at any point a reason to really care. It was atmosphere over substance, the dots just don't connect. The many creep-out moments weren't developed from a core idea but the story was seemingly contrived on whatever they thought might just be spooky.Story-wise it doesn't seem to know what to do with itself. It doesn't really seem to move except in infrequent jumps. The story doesn't develop outside of key moments, it just sort of ruminates. I like a slow burn and all, but this didn't even crackle It just throws a bunch of gasoline on itself and lights a match once in a while. It has its moments sure but what do I do with the flaccid quarter-hours?I haven't even gotten to the other problems I have with its story but I guess this review is already over staying its welcome. I acknowledge that this movie is trying to do something pretty cool and when I hear people talk positively about it I can't help but think that I'd LOVE to see the movie that they're talking about. Overall, I don't think this movie explores grief at all, it just depicts it without any kind of insight or freshness. It's not very original in its themes or concepts, it just put them into a genre where they are not seen so often and didn't even have the courtesy to follow through.The story problems notwithstanding I must say it sort of looks fantastic (when Collette isn't lemon-facing at the camera). There is a cool, melancholic broodiness, at least in the first act and it made me want to forgive a lot of what I've seen. But sadly it is just wasted because, no matter how neat the visualization is, I cannot get much of an atmosphere out of a story that is so meandering and with no real pull for me as a viewer because the truth is that I just don't care about the characters and their interactions are just going through motions. By the third act it just feels like another teen-scream. Ultimately I feel like it just does not explore any of the themes people insist it explores. It just happens to be about them.It is very heavy handed. Most obviously in the music. The handling of music is HORRIBLE! I cannot stress how incompetent the music direction on this is. It's as bad as ""Get out"" and ""The Hole in the Ground"" combined. The music itself is fine; put that on a CD and it can be fun to listen to as Dark Ambient, but it just kills any atmosphere this movie might have had because they really pile it on thick here, like everything else. A little restraint goes a long way in this genre and it's curious that people think of this as a smart horror when it is handled just like all the rest. It just had some better materials to work with (that have been squandered).And that's before we get to the soapy dialogue: this so does not earn the screaming matches it thinks are emotional nor does it justify deeply unsympathetic mother character who is overacted at nearly every turn. Toni Collette shows the subtlety and restraint of Pennywise in being the most excruciatingly pugnacious and hysterical as she can be. But I suppose even a good actor can only do so much with this kind of script that thinks Eastenders is the height of drama. I would so check out another movie she's in just to see if it really is just the script or if she's that inept of an actor.Whoever played Charlie by contrast...amazing work, whatever your name is. Best thing in this movie.For all the ways it tries to be a nuanced and complex piece of storytelling there is just something so annoying, so risible, so *arrogant* in its pretence of being an ""arty"", new age kind of horror when it is really just another generic horror that took a few more of all the wrong risks ultimately showing its colors as more style than substance.Here's a few things they threw in just because:They begin with text on black screen. Never a good sign.The camera rotates 90 degrees on two characters. It is very artificial.A character sees something in a reflection that isn't an accurate reflection of the thing (never seen that before...)Upside-down tracking shot.Dream fake out (now come on...)It handles its uncanniness poorly. It doesn't establish the parameters that allow for this early on. It doesn't allow us to consider any ambiguity on whether they supernatural or just mental illness.I know a lot of people will say ""I guess some people would like a gorefest with no subtlety"". I would love to see a well made, subtle, horror/dark movie. I'm not saying I have refined tastes, it just sounds fun. But one has to remember that being confusing is not the same thing as being meaningful, being convoluted is not the same thing as being nuanced and putting style over substance does not immediately elevate you above all the other cookie cutter examples of your genre.I once thought that anything that tried to be unique had to be worth seeing. I'm not saying you shouldn't see this, even if just so you can talk about with your friends because is indeed unique. I will say in its defence that with SO MANY conveyor belt horrors out there that really do not deserve to be bared with past the first 10 minutes, at least this is audacious and singular enough to be watchable for its 2 hour runtime. I do not force myself through movies, if I don't feel gripped I give up and I saw this in one sitting.",Hereditary

The moment Collette starts climbing the walls like Spiderman and gliding about like a Scooby-Doo ghost, the atmosphere was broken.HEREDITARY is most compelling when the horror comes from the awful tragedy of the young girl's death or the emotional hell the family goes through in the aftermath, blaming one another. I spent much of the movie terrified the mother would break down completely and kill her own son.The twist is such a conventional letdown. It felt so, so boilerplate, something you'd get from THE CONJURING.The only reason this isn't lower than a 7/10 from me is because the first half was just so great.

63,drownnnsoda,Visceral and dreadful by turns,8,8 June 2018,"In ""Hereditary,"" an artist mother grapples with the death of her mother, a mysterious woman from whom she was long estranged. Her death triggers a succession of tragedies and bizarre events that threaten to unravel her family.I'll keep major plot points unwritten here as I feel the less you know about this film, the better. Multiplex popcorn moviegoers are likely to be bored into tedium by ""Hereditary"" (one patron complained about how terribly boring the film was after the screening I was in), and to some degree I can understand why, as the film does sag a bit in the middle; not nearly to the point of derailment though, and what precedes it and follows it more than make up for an feet-dragging.Like many of the indie horrors of this era, ""Hereditary"" takes the less-is-more route and reaps significant rewards. It's minimalist but effective, its horror entangled in a family drama that offers enough shocks on its own. The film is expertly photographed and extremely atmospheric; the Utah landscapes and the cavernous craftsman home where most of the action takes place are bewitching; underpinning it all is a simplistic but effective score. While there are some emotionally-shocking moments in the first two-thirds of the film, the last act is where it really cuts loose, giving way to utter pandemonium; even still, there is a subdued nature to the most fantastical elements. Writer-director Ari Aster clearly took cues from ""Rosemary's Baby"" in writing the film, and whether or not he intended, he wears this influence on his sleeve; visually, it at times recalls Charles Laughton's ""The Night of the Hunter."" However, the insanity of ""Hereditary"" as it builds to its fever pitch is anchored in Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne's core performances; Collette's range is especially made use of here. The younger actors- Alex Wolff, who plays their son, and Milly Shapiro, who plays their eccentric daughter-are also impressive, and Wolff effectively portrays some of the script's most emotionally wrought material.While the film does seem to run itself slightly thin in the middle, I never once lost an ounce of interest, which is a testament to the multitude of strengths working under the surface. While ""Hereditary"" certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, it evokes a crescendo of dread that is effectively disrupted by more visceral terrors. It is not a perfect film, but it's easily the best horror offering I've seen this year thus far.",Hereditary

65,kluseba,Red flags,8,1 October 2019,"I'm one of the few who watched Ari Aster's second feature Midsommar before his first full length movie Hereditary. Hereditary is slightly better than Midsommar because it slowly develops a haunting atmosphere until a vibrant final quarter that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Hereditary isn't a masterpiece like The Wailing but certainly among the better Hollywood horror movies in recent memory.The acting is certainly one of the movie's strongest points. Milly Shapiro is absolutely astonishing as eccentric young teenage girl with odd and at times disturbing behaviour. She is a name you have to keep on your mind for future endeavourments. This movie would have been even better if she had been given more screen time. Alex Wolff plays a completely different character as a seemingly normal teenage boy who likes to party but soon becomes an isolated loner confronted with abominable dangers. Toni Collette is fully convincing as desperate, gloomy and unstable mother whose beahviour becomes more erratic as the film progresses. Gabriel Byrne complements her perfectly as calm, diplomatic and rational husband who handles the pressure around him better than anyone else. The four characters have great chemistry and complement one another perfectly.Another strong point of this movie is its atmosphere. Right from the start, you realize that something is wrong with this family. There are numerous red flags throughout the film. The daughter plays with a dead bird and cuts its head off. The son comes home at night after shocking events but decides to go to bed instead of calling the police. The mother starts to believe she is a medium who can speak with the dead. Only the father's behaviour is rational and he is easily the character worth rooting for.The movie has a few minor downsides however. Even if this is a supernatural horror movie, some decisions of the characters are baffling. How can a mother send her antisocial daughter who suffers from severe allergies to a party with her older brother? How can the father quietly observe how the family members around him show more and more erratic behaviour instead of taking them to the hospital? Why does the mother not call the police after she discovered several more than disturbing elements in her house? Some of the actions, decisions and reactions of the characters make an otherwise solid plot slightly unconvincing.In the end, Hereditary is an atmospheric horror movie with psychological and supernatural elements. Instead of delivering predictable jump scares, the movie fleshes out its characters and plot and remains refreshingly unpredictable until the very end. Despite a slow pace and a few weird decisions made by the characters, Hereditary is one of the better horror movies of the past few years. If you like this film, watch the even better The Wailing and give the less supernatural but more psychological horror movie Burning a try.",Hereditary
66,davispittman,Will go down as a horror masterpiece,10,14 June 2018,"Hereditary (2018) is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. I can say with confidence that this film will go down as a horror masterpiece, and one of the best reviewed horrors ever. It's a both a psychological and supernatural horror, it balances both aspects beautifully. I love that this film didn't have one single cheesy moment, the entire thing was genuinely horrifying and interesting. The story will draw you in and you won't be able to take your eyes away from what's happening onscreen. The acting was very impressive, especially from the star, Toni Collete. Give this woman an academy award for this performance because damn she was incredible, as was everyone else. The script was crafted in a near perfect way because it was strong on the story it was telling, it was creepy, and it did an excellent job at keeping the audiences attention throughout the whole thing. The ending is for sure one of the greatest endings I've ever witnessed, I mean just incredible. Go see this movie! But beware it is NOT for the faint of heart. 10/10 for Hereditary!

68,Pairic,A New Paradigm In Horror,10,16 June 2018,"Hereditary: Tolstoy wrote: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" In this film each member of the Graham family is unhappy in their own way. Annie (Toni Collette), the mother, grieves for her own recently deceased mother. But she was estranged from that difficult, domineering woman for years only reconciling towards the end. Her father starved himself to death, her brother committed committed suicide. All of that trauma seems to have driven Annie over the edge. Charlie (Milly Shapiro), the daughter, is unhappy in herself, gorges on chocolate, sketches continuously, cuts the heads off dead birds, sleeps in a treehouse. Peter (Alex Wolff), the son, is a pothead, he feels unloved by his mother, as the film unfolds he develops a crippling guilt over an accident he feels responsible for. Steve (Gabriel Byrne), the paterfamilias, has a countenance as dour and world weary as we've come to expect from Stephen Rea. He carries out the mundane tasks of cooking and trying to keep the family together. A counterpoint to the craziness of Annie.One of the most shocking scenes in the film has no explicit supernatural cause but it left me gasping. There are plenty of shocks provoked by strange entities though and none of seem forced. Spirits possess Seance participants, messages are written on chalkboards by invisible hands. Murderous spirits are summoned up. Levitation and Spontaneous Human Combustion All of this is somehow related to secrets kept by Annie's deceased mother.Annie builds dolls house's, meticulously detailed, she is even working on a model of the hospice where her mother died. This is used by director Ari Aster to frame many shots as the action moves seamlessly from model to the real house and back again. The Graham's residence has the appearance of a dolls house, the furniture layout, shots along corridors. While Aster is at the helm and delivers a witty but scare inducing screenplay, cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski, editing by Lucian Johnston and Jennifer Lame, production design by Grace Yun and set decoration by Brian Lives all contribute to success of this unique Horror Film. I see elements of A Dark Song, Kill List, The Exorcist and even Rosemary's Baby but this is very much it's own film. Pacing is perfect. A new paradigm in Horror. 9.5/10.",Hereditary

Maybe then we could do something with this.
But you can't take responsibility for anything!
So now I can't accept... And I can't forgive because...
Because nobody admits anything they've done!""Hereditary"". A film I was really looking forward to and expected a lot from. Unfortunately, it was kind of a disappointment. If it would be a psychological drama that concentrated on the traumatizing effect after the loss of a relative with a labile mother as a result, I would have liked it. The fact Annie (Toni Colette) doesn't have a stable and healthy mind is actually not that surprising. Not with a psychotic depressed father who starved himself. And a schizophrenic brother who hung himself in his mother's bedroom. And a dominant mother figure that, in my opinion, couldn't think clearly. Annie's mother isn't really clearheaded when you see the diorama with Annie breastfeeding her daughter. At least if this diorama displays how it happened in reality. And they generally do. A person would go nuts for a lot less.And Annie also goes completely through the ribbon after the terrible accident that happens to her daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). A strange little girl with a downright peculiar appearance. A regrettable and mind-boggling accident. And her brother Peter (Alex Wolff), can hardly be blamed. Maybe he should not have left Charlie on her own that night. Leaving her so he could smoke some weed with a nice girl from his class, isn't only bad for his health. It also results in this dismal accident. An impressive moment of acting and at the same time a heavy emotional event that'll get under your skin. No, this film isn't about scary and blood-curdling scenes. Not initially, that is. It's the grief for those who died, that makes the most impression. You'll be struck by an uncomfortable feeling when you hear Annie screaming and crying. A sound like nails on a chalkboard. And you'll feel sorry for Peter who doesn't know what to do with his sorrow.""Hereditary"" isn't an easy movie. Emotionally you are dragged back and forth. Just like the members of the Graham family. A mother who has been traumatized by her past. Husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) who looks at everything in a passive way and actually has no idea sometimes how to deal with the situation. And the son Peter, whose bond with his mother comes across as reasonably dysfunctional, tries to soften his frustration by using mind-altering substances. And then there's Charlie. A little girl who clearly lives in her own universe. And above this dislocated family the spirit (Not literally! Or maybe it does.) of a seemingly tyrannical and dominating grandmother floats around. A woman who also had an unhealthy interest in the occult.""Hereditary"" knows how to keep the suspense alive in a smart way. The mysterious mood is constantly present. It's also a terribly slow film with an enervating soundtrack in the background. At a certain moment, you don't know what makes you nervous the most. The whole atmosphere or the slow pace. What I do hate a lot, is the exaggerated hyping movies like ""Hereditary"". According to their crafty marketing department, this would be the most terrifying horror film of the last 50 years. Even scarier than ""The Exorcist"". This ought to be correct if you read the press releases. People are fainting and are leaving the theater massively because it's so scary. Maybe that's why you're feeling tense. Even when the movie just started. Trust me. Apart from a few explicit graphic shots, it's all reasonably suggestive. ""Hereditary"" is again such a horror movie with a double meaning. A movie that pushes your feeling in a certain direction and finally has such a twist that you are totally lost. A film that simply begs for a re-watch so you might discover the missed hints. And that, fellow moviegoers, is something I never do and I'm not planning to begin with in the future.Don't get me wrong. This is a gem when you look at the cinematographic part and the acting. The way in which everything is depicted is simply fantastic. Sometimes it might be a bit exaggerated so that you get a multitude of painfully slowly zoomed in images. But in general, it's a pleasure to watch and a continuation of the wonderful footage from the intro. Toni Colette plays a major role in this film (with the dinner scene as highlight). It's certainly not easy to play such a tormented soul. A beautiful performance delivered by this actress (even though she already convinced me of her acting talent in ""Miss you already"" and ""Please stand by""). And it remained mysterious and ominous until it escalated at a certain moment and evolved into a sort of ""The Lords of Salem"". And when you reach the end you'll probably conclude that it's indeed advisable to watch the film again so you can rediscover certain clues. But again, that's not my cup of tea.",Hereditary

74,Reviews_of_the_Dead,An Amazing First Film,10,7 July 2019,"This was a film that I kept seeing the trailer for when I was in the theater seeing other films. I had been anticipating for it for some time and was worrying that it might not hold up. Now I'm revising this after my second viewing, which was also back in the theater. The official synopsis is when the matriarch of the Graham family passes away; her daughter's family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry.I have to lead off stating that I felt the film lived up to the hype that it had preceding it. I personally don't consider this a slow-burn, even though some might. I felt that the beginning of the film does establish things that come back in the end, but the feeling of foreboding dread coupled with creepy things happening throughout.The mystery of this film is so deep. We know that Annie (Toni Collette) had an on and off again relationship with her mother. She establishes there is a long line of mental health issues with the family. I thought this was a good touch for the film, especially with Annie's husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne). He is the rock of the family trying to keep everything together.Also in the family are their son, Peter (Alex Wolff), and their daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Charlie seems to have some sort of mental handicap, but it is never established what it was. It was interesting that when she was born, the grandmother was let back in Annie's life and insisted on feeding Charlie. It is established as well that she is the favorite. It is Charlie who reveals though that the grandmother wanted her to be a boy.This story also combines elements of grief, which can make us go a little bit crazy in dealing with. Someone like Annie with a family history of mental illness is more susceptible than others to this. I like that the film has a character like Steve trying to deal with everything rationally where Annie starts to think that it could be supernatural. We as the audience get to see everything going on, but I do like the rationality the film maintains.To couple with this though is the editing of the film. This film not only looks beautiful, but I love the interesting ways that the film transitions. Annie works on miniatures of things and many of them are of scenes she experienced or of the house they live in. What I like about this is we will get camera zooms into the minis and then the scene will play out which I found to be interesting. On top of that though, I love that the film uses the miniatures to fill in events we don't see as well. The film builds tension throughout and you can just feel it build as things are revealed. I thought the ending was good and definitely well worth what we see play out.Going along with the editing and the story was the acting, which I thought was amazing. Collette does a great job in this film. You see her have to deal with grief, but then it morphs into anger. She has a dinner scene that made me go numb for how powerful it was. You also learn more about her character and it is scary. I thought Byrne was good as the counterpoint to her, which the film needed. Wolff does an amazing job in the performance he plays. The fear he deals with was ramped up and I believed it. Going back to them being the opposites, both are feeling grief, but aren't actually dealing with it. They harbor resentment toward the other. I also thought that Shapiro was good in the role she played. Ann Dowd also appears in this film as a woman dealing with grief who reaches out to Collette's character. I thought she did good as well and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.As for the effects of the film, there aren't a lot to begin with. Most of them are done practically it would seem with some interesting camera angles. The ones that were done with computers looked to be seamless and I couldn't tell the difference. I was definitely impressed with what I saw and had no issues there. The film is also shot beautifully.The soundtrack of the film I also thought was good. It fit the scenes for what they needed. It helped to enhance the scenes and definitely gave me a creepy vibe. I won't say that it is the best soundtrack out there, but it was great for what they needed to do in heightening the tension. I think what makes it effective, is a majority of the film is in silence. When things are ramping up when it is used. It is quite effective.Now with that said, this film is great. I was blown away by the complexity of the story and how everything plays out. The atmosphere is one that is tense and just gets worse and worse as the film progresses. With every new clue, it becomes that much weirder. There are also so many subtle things that are used here from the lessons in class to little images here and there. I thought the editing definitely helps here. The film is shot beautifully and does some great transitions. Going along with this is the acting, which I thought was great as well. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but the ones used; both practical and computer are seamless. The score of the film is great in building up the scenes for what they are doing. I think this film is great, but maybe not for everyone. This film made me anxious and freaked out for sure. I will boldly say this is one of my favorite films in the last decade and one of my favorite horror films of all time.",Hereditary
75,robertemerald,Genuinely scary horror,9,11 February 2019,"The set up here is truly original and propels the story forward with precise use of props and consequent framing of the imagery. I couldn't help admire the filmmakers' talent for finding perfect shots out of each scene to command the dread or outright spook the viewer. I'd imagine establishing shots or images were crucial too, and again a touch of genius. Use of dawns and dusks was also creepy. Spooky background soundscape as well, also a thing of unspoken talent. This movie must surely be cutting edge horror. The unusual rambling house in the woods is perfect, as strange lights from strange angles come on or extinguish. The filmmakers were bold with their use of special effects early on, and thus the transition to wilder happenings toward the end comes across as, well, perfectly reasonable. It's a descent into the abyss, it's spellbinding, and by the end of two pulsating hours one is genuinely transfixed. The evolution of the characters is truly a slow train coming, brilliantly timed and performed. There's nothing lazy about this movie. Aside from the creeping horror there are genuine moments of pure shock and awe. You'll be jumping with fright from very early on. And scared. Hereditary is a really good horror movie.",Hereditary

79,jadepietro,As the Graham Crackers Crumble,6,12 June 2018,"GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite fine acting and direction, pretension undoes tension in this far-fetched and ultimately disappointing supernatural thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: Beware the artsy independent horror film! Usually adored by critics and well-crafted by its filmmakers, this genre begins intriguingly, builds its tension well, only to lose all reason by its third act. You have seen this all before, with movies like The Witch, It Follows, The Blair Witch Project, The Strangers, and mother!...all of the spooky parts that never make a rational whole. We now have to add writer / director Ari Aster's Hereditary to the mix. This is not to say that the movie is not impressive: it is very effective in its imagery and acting. But it just has such an unsatisfying and loopy ending which diminishes all the chills and thrills that come before.The story involves Annie Graham (Toni Collette), a visual artist who creates miniature environments with painstaking detailed accuracy. Her precision and skill, however, only seem apparent in her art. As a passionate mother and wife, she is far from perfect. Hereditary begins with the death of Annie's mother, also a fractured force in her unusual upbringing. We meet the other family members at the funeral: her stoic husband, Steve (Gabriel Bryne), her creepy introverted daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and her unloved drug-laden son Peter (Alex Wolff). From the start, everyone has abnormal tendencies. All exist within their own traumatic universe, with no one in authority questioning this family's unhealthy choices. Their behavior, to say the least, is relentlessly odd and overtly weird. Yes, there are bizarre dysfunctional families...and then there are The Grahams. When the film's central characters relish in their eccentricities and erratic ways, there is no norm in this new normal. Everything gets all the more curiouser and very bewildering.Where the film is its most effective is in its domestic family drama storyline, that is, before it veers into the supernatural realm. Strange and unexplainable things begin to happen and the filmmakers create the right tone for this horror film's initial set-up. This is Mr. Aster's directorial debut and it signals the making of a talented director. He fills the screen with surreal images (ants crawling on a severed head, black flies buzzing away in an attic, flames suddenly combusting for no reason, a child's rubber ball bouncing out of the shadows, etc.). The director also populates his story with engrossing characters and many pivotal dramatic scenes.(Kudos to cinematographer Pawel Pogorelski who captures the claustrophobic feel of Grace Yun's strong production design and he photographs the home with low angle shots to reinforce the eerie dollhouse theme with stark lighting and shadow for the necessary eerie haunted house effect.But the screenplay piles high its contrived plot devices and interesting twists that feed on circumstances which are illogical and never fully thought out. Complicating the build-up of incredulous happenings are inexplicable acts of violence that would trigger the immediate appearances of law enforcement, school, or medical authorities who never seem to intercede. As the film progresses, the moviegoer has to suspend belief to make sense of it all, and some of low budget CGI do not help matters. Just saying that there are supernatural forces at play does not justify the action of some characters and their whereabouts while their motives remain murky at best.The acting is top notch. Mr. Bryne and Ms. Shapiro are very fine in their roles but it is the conflict between mother and son that anchors the film. Mr. Wolff plays the troubled teen with aching despair. He plies his character with angst, guilt, and a tender quality of sadness. He is the emotional counterbalance to Ms. Collette's shrew mother figure. Partly deranged confessor, partly loving and cruel Mommie Dearest, the actress excels with an unparalleled emotional range. It is worthy of Oscar contention. Also giving yeomanlike support is the reliable Anne Dowd as Annie's new friend, Joanie, from her group therapy session.Hereditary is a powerful directing showcase for a new creative talent like Mr. Asher. His film may be disturbing and intense, but it is also pretentious and absurd due to his wonky script. Yes, there is more here that meets the eye, even if the mind is not fully convinced about all of those bumps in the night.",Hereditary

It's a melodrama of incest so excessive (I mean the melodrama, but also incest, to tell the truth) that it has an ending... excessive too, but, since it is a student short film, the execution seemed quite mature to me and I thought that upon seeing it, his teachers surely said, ""He has what it takes, at least to make movies in Los Angeles...""Toni Collette is an actress that I have admired since I saw her in ""Muriel's Wedding."" She has not always made the best choices when accepting her roles, but once she gets into it, she gives the right performance. What a good actress. She had already told her agent that she did not want to make any more horror movies, but she made an exception for ""Hereditary"", because I do not know what she saw in the script that appealed to her. That her character was going to end up walking up on the walls? I do not know... but in the script, I suspect, there were the elements of this... yes, excessive story that Aster tells us, and that take the film to the lowest level imaginable, like a tower of cards that collapses completely. I cannot think of another image, nor is it worth racking my brain thinking about another.What a horror with this Cancerian filmmaker ... The same screaming of the Johnsons, which was later reprised by the insufferable protagonist of ""Midsommar"", the same family obsessions with the dead and unfinished business with them, the same childhood obsession with Witchcraft 101 for no clever purpose, not even, I say, to stimulate in the audience an open and healthy attitude towards paranormal phenomena. But what an illusion ... Screams come and go, heads fly from here to there, everyone gets very stupid, nobody understands anything, and some naked fools celebrate rites that make everyone more foolish, including the audience...Nothing. I tried to make up with Aster, but I could not. His first two features are no better than his student short. Compared to them, ""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons"" is a measured film. The young actor Alex Wolff is appropriately used in this story of the most incompetent coven that I have witnessed in all these years of watching movies about witches and warlocks! It destroys an entire family for not being successful, the first time, in finding the right body (heck, the book said it had to be a male!) for one of those gods that they make up to materialize on this planet. Imagine... on this planet.",Hereditary
82,RatedVforVinny,For once a film that lived up to the hype.,9,5 November 2018,"'Hereditary', is a modern masterpiece (in the horror world). So few films come along and take this type of subject matter/material so seriously. I can't imagine anyone who is a true fan of the genre feeling (at all) let down. The intricate details build up such a brooding, malevolent tension. For me the best examples do not actually represent, just reflect what the supernatural world could be (or possibly consist of). This aspect alone, coupled with some hardcore Devil worshiping, makes 'Hereditary' truly an unerving experience. The musical score is brilliant to, almost like a living backbone, to the chills we witness on screen. Acting, directing, cast are all near perfect. Would have scored it a perfect 10 but I feel the quality of the special effects, was not fully consistent. This is the movie you could indeed revisit many times.",Hereditary
83,rgkarim,"A Genetic Mutation in Horror, That Took Long To Execute With A Finale That Was Meh",8,8 June 2018,"Robbie K here, ready to try and do another movie justice in his reviews and observations. Tonight's focus is on a horror movie that looked very disturbing, chilling to the bone, and potentially containing a high creep factor to really make you squirm in your seats. Yes, assuming you read the title of the movie on your way into this review I'm giving you my thoughts and observations on...Hereditary (2018)Director:
 Ari Aster
Writer:
 Ari Aster
Stars:
 Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro, Gabriel ByrneLIKES: 
Creepy: The trailers didn't lie, Hereditary is creepy as heck and not afraid to flaunt it in so many forms. While not loaded with jump scares that many love, Hereditary is all about using shadows and the edge of your vision to make you see things. It uses subtle sounds to keep you on the edge, and reveals just enough to keep you further engrossed in the thrills. Hereditary also is not afraid to cross the line to really get a reaction going, sometimes to the point of intensely disturbing visuals that one does not expect to see. Yet, my friends and I all agreed that the true creep factor comes from how realistic this movie is, at least at the beginning. The questions of how much is true and how much potential psychosis is helps depict some of the more extreme cases of mental illness and how dangerous and intense this disease can be. The Setting: A creepy movie requires a setting to bring it to life and this movie has got that going on for it too. The house is classic, semi isolated from town, with enough nooks and crannies to generate shadows that hide in the light. It's not these random temples or abandoned houses, but an actual lived in home that brings that realism to light and immerses you into the movie. And if you don't care about the creepy shadows and lights the movie holds, then just enjoy the beauty of the house, especially if you were dragged to the movie to begin with. 
Dynamic Story Changes: A fancy way of saying twisting transition, Hereditary's writer certainly new how to adjust the script to bring a different atmosphere with the movie. At first more of a psycho thriller with some potential horror elements, the movie manages to gradually fluctuate into other genres. It evolves into different types of horrors, and with it brings more levels of disturbing twists to begin to connect semi-vague pieces together. It certainly a bit haphazard and mashed like a play, but I give props for a writer willing to switch gears from time to time. In addition, some of the lengths they go to shake things up are certainly risky, but with it generating some reaction you weren't quite expecting. DISLIKES:Long: Heritage certainly does the job of tying up loose ends and making sure everything is explained (which of course is a like). Sadly, it takes a little too long to get to that point and in a very complex manner that is almost like going around your elbow to get to your thumb. The second act, and partially the third act, were very drawn out, boring to the point of trying to make these connections in a mask of coping mechanisms. Again, it's realism and portrayal are awesome, but as the direction of the movie starts to change, these weird transitions start to feel a bit too odd and not worth your time. The Goofy Faces: Some of the movie tried to bring some torturous reactions in the non-verbal acting. Poor Toni Collette came off with some rather goofy, perhaps unintentional, faces that were funny and looked more like being stoned or maybe getting brain freeze. Her son Peter (Alex Wolff) didn't turn out much better, as his own facial dynamics were, well goofy as well, primarily in that buck toothed, stoned look that was meant to be exhaustion. The Acting: Don't get me wrong, the acting was mostly decent, if not good, primarily in the portrayal of mental illness and fear. Yet there were times where hysterical crying, yelling, and blubbering were again a little too much and went down the wrong path. I'm not trying to pick on Wolff, but his hysterical crying was a little too forced for me and seemed incredibly fake compared to the rest of his performance. Why this gimmick was done more than once, not really known, but I can't say that it was a direction I would have taken. The Tongue Clicking: Not quite an as annoying as the trailers made it out, the use of the tongue clicking was decent at times, but a little over used. Whether it was the amplification by the speakers, or maybe just the excessive/random moments, this device started to grow annoyingly humorous and needed to stop. Thank goodness they got light of it and didn't bombard us too much with it. The Complexity: A complex plot makes you think, makes you question, and more importantly keeps you engaged. This movie accomplished those goals, but when the ending finally came through and the final transition happened, the complexity felt stupid and unneeded. Again, it supports the ending, but because of how much I didn't like the ending, this complexity just didn't feel the right direction to me outside of extending the film. Complexity can be good with a real good finish, (which some may like), but for this reviewer the ends didn't justify the means. The Ending: You saw this coming, but Hereditary's ending wasn't the one I had in mind from the trailers. A surprise can be good, but to quote my friends, the ending had completely leaped over the gap to another movie altogether that didn't quite fit all the way with the direction the first act did. It was almost like two screenwriters wrote the two halves, came together and tried to paste them together (even though there was supposedly only one writer). While the broad transitions will grip more people in, the movie's grand finale wasn't my cup of tea, though it may explain the disturbing steps this writer planned. And some of the end game decisions, rushed, pointless, and really not pleasant to look at (fans who see the movie will know what I'm talking about). The VERDICT:  The other reviews are right, this movie keeps you guessing, has a number of twists, is creepy and hard to stomach, and not afraid to go down the dark abyss to bring you shock. So, bravo in thinking outside the box and crafting a rather original tale with a dynamic component to it. Yet, this movie's tinkering with the plot was unnecessarily complex, with a few gimmicks/deliveries not really keeping in tone with the genre and the ends not justifying the lengthy journey I took to get there. If you like the Lords of Salem, you are going to enjoy the approach this movie takes, as it feels very similar in a lot of components. Yet, if you want a more linear, straightforward movie, hold your horses for later this year when other films are supposed to grace the silver screen. My scores are: Drama/Horror/Mystery: 8.0Movie Overall: 7.0",Hereditary

85,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Hereditary,6,14 June 2018,"""Don't you ever raise your voice to me, I'm your mother!"" So quips the character of Annie Graham in Hereditary. Graham is shown in a couple of close-up scenes shivering like Danny Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. It's a valiant effort but it pales in comparison to what Kubrick did with grainy early 80's, lens chic. Anyway, Hereditary contains decapitations and spiritual seances. It has buzzing flies and scaling demons. It boasts plenty of adolescent weed smoking and head-scratching dollhouse construction. Finally, Hereditary heralds a performance from Toni Collette that's better than her Oscar-nominated turn in The Sixth Sense. Taking place in mountainous Utah and directed by a first-timer (NYC's own Ari Aster), Hereditary's blueprint story involves a family dealing with the loss and grief of veritable loved ones. The movie then veers more into mumbo jumbo territory with a screw loose ending involving naked Paimon spirits. Hereditary, which has a trailer that's very misleading, isn't just about a dead grandmother and a creepy thirteen-year-old who makes noises with her jaw. No there's much more going on than that. Maybe too much and not of the overriding kind. In truth, I may have gotten a slight Amityville Horror/Shining vibe from watching Hereditary. Too bad I can't garner a recommendation. What can I say, it takes a heck of a lot more than contrived references and manner over substance to get me scared.For what it's worth, helmer Aster does an impressive job with a $10 million dollar budget. His camerawork is supreme, he bounces off of Hitchcock, and he sets up a lot of his shots well. His Kubrickian-like direction laced with art house novelty is assured but for all the wrong reasons. Hereditary goads you and baits you into thinking you'll be frightened out of your seat. The problem is that nothing ever quite comes to fruition making Hereditary the ultimate cinematic tease. In conclusion, many critics have already hailed Hereditary as a horror masterpiece. I for one think it's too slow burned, too faux inducing, too baffling, and a bit overrated. Hereditary may offer a few eldritch moments but it doesn't ""inherit"" greatness. My rating: 2 and a half stars.",Hereditary
86,justin-fencsak,"A little slow moving at first, but gets interesting towards the end!!!",8,6 November 2018,"In a year where fear dominates the news, horror still rules the box office with hit movies such as Halloween 2018, A Quiet Place, The Nun, The First Purge, Happy Death Day, and now this movie, Hereditary, which has become A24's highest grossing movie worldwide of all time since Lady Bird last year, which came a year after Moonlight won best picture a year after another indie movie, Spotlight, by what is now Global Road Entertainment, came out and shocked the oscars. Toni Collette shines as the lead female in a movie that deals with death, religion, and spirits. The cinematography is very good, but the pacing can be a bit slow in the beginning. As the story progresses, it gets scary and scarier. Worthy of a rental or purchase. A must for horror fans.",Hereditary
87,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,An urban legend attached to this supremely creepy movie.,10,12 June 2018,"Before I get to my review of this one, I must address that, allegedly, a trailer for this graphic horror film was shown to a theatre full of small kids, gathered to see a kid's movie, who all went screaming for the exits. The cinema owners offered free passes to all present, as compensation. Curiously, in 2007, a similar event occurred, when The Hills Have Eyes Part II was allegedly shown to a theatre full of small kids, who all went screaming for the exits. The cinema owners offered free passes to all present, as compensation. ( Source: moviefone.com/2007/04/06/theater-accidentally-shows-hills-have-eyes-2-to-little-kids/ ) Even more curious, is another cinema allegedly showed one of the recent Saw sequels to a theatre full of small kids, who all went screaming for the exits. The cinema owners offered free passes to those present, as compensation. Sound familiar? Several other times in recent years, a graphic horror film was allegedly shown to a group of small kids, who had gathered to watch a kids' movie, and the theatre owners gave them all free passes as compensation. These stories were widely reported by reputable sources at the time, and every year or two, when a really graphic horror film is released, it allegedly happens again, reported by all the news outlets. It is nothing more than an urban legend. It's not real. No matter where you hear it reported, the exact same story goes around every year or two, the details are always, always, always the same, only the film titles vary: graphic horror shown to a group of kids, they are understandably terrified, theatre owners offer free movie passes as compensation. Don't be fooled into believing this urban legend. Now, on to the movie review, and ..... Wow! It's rare that a movie genuinely disturbs me, due to its unsettling tone, but this film did that, several times over. I went into this one after having only seen one trailer for it a couple of weeks ago, not really even sure what the plot was about, and I think that is the best way to go into this, as cold as possible. Its deliberately slow pacing draws one in to its bizarre story of a crumbling family following the death of their less than loveable grandmother, and the sudden, accidental death of the young daughter ( in one of the most horrifying scenes in recent memory, one which will be stuck in my mind for all time. This film had two such scenes which are likely burnt into my mind forever. ) From then on, we're not sure if the mother, with her history of violence and mental instability, is slowly going crazy, or if it's the teenage son slowly going crazy, both from the death of his sister, and his mother's mentally fractured behaviour, or if there is some other force at work. Very well acted by its trio of main leads, filled with low, ominous sounds, a complete lack of cheap jump scares, and an overall feeling of dread make this nearly unbearably, unwatchably tense, as does a complete lack of humour. There is not one single moment of levity in this entire film. Also, a completely self-contained plot, with zero references to other films drew me into the plot even more. This is a rare horror movie which, while very good, it disturbed me to the point that I don't think I could ever watch it again. It's too unsettling. Highly recommended, just be prepared for a very quiet, unsettling, genuinely frightening plot.",Hereditary
88,vengeance20,Well...,5,19 July 2018,"Seen this a month ago but never really got around to reviewing until now.To put it simply, it was ok & no more.I mean it was pretty good, sinister, creepy & plain screwed up. But on the other hand it was slow, boring, depressing & weird! It was 50/50, in short.I liked the film & its creepy elements, but I also felt the film could've been at least 40 minutes shorter & cut the crap in a lot of areas, which I get (in a way) were for dramatic purposes, but still, dragging scenes out (longer than what they should be) to the extent to which it starts to bore the audience, (& it feels like running through quicksand) means there is something wrong with the films pacing & editing (techniques)!But the film was nonetheless sinister & purely epic in terms of it's content! Sadly it was let down by it's overly long run time, pacing & editing! 5/10 That's fair!",Hereditary
89,begob,Rosemary's Babadook,7,9 July 2020,"An ungrieving daughter becomes a grieving mother, and her family descends into madness ...Opens on a skilful shot to take us seamlessly inside a doll-house that opens into domestic reality. All about family, and we hit the Babadook vibe from the off, with difficult children in tense confrontation with a difficult mother, as the distress ebbs and flows. At the hour mark we go through the looking glass into horror, with a coven vibe similar to Paranormal Activity (very different style) - or I suppose Rosemary's Baby is the obvious influence.Cinematography is excellent, with an odd effect I haven't seen before, where the sky switches on and off like an electric light. Editing is fairly snappy, so the pace is good, and the score is uneven - very heavy and brooding in the first part, then almost disappears, only to come brooding back at the end. Strong performances all round, with Collette playing a strange and disturbing role.I did have a problem writing the logline for the review, and I don't feel the story is fully integrated. More committed to the supernatural than the Babadook, more explicit than Paranormal Activity - and somehow we end with an odd climax, where the most extreme moment is underplayed, and the set-piece that follows is overplayed. Hmmm.Some of the horror images are great, others very good. And there are some ideas ""floating"" around, but I'm not sure I get them. Why the miniatures and the doll-house? How does the history of psychosis tie in with the supernatural? Does the sky effect suggest a world separated from time? Why isn't the father key to the secret, how did he get on with the grandmother?Overall: Stylish, intense horror, but doesn't hang together.",Hereditary

It's long, veeery long it's starts transitioning from family drama to a horror movie towards the middle.

92,m-47826,"Movie too pleased with itself, to leave room for improvement.",1,23 July 2021,"People loving this are exactly like the cult we see at the end of this dud. They seem completely mesmerized by a boy wearing a cardboard crown. Toni Colette was good, but she always is. The rest of the cast however, has faces you want to punch, and their characters are annoying beyond words. Even Ann Dowd looked ridiculous chanting in the middle of the street. As usual, the director was too busy pleasing himself, he forgot to write a good script and plausible build up. I was either appalled or amused by it. The « shocking scenes » were out on left field. It made me laugh or simply wondering what was happening on screen. It was extremely anticlimactic and full of itself, so the fact that it is said to be one of the best horror movies. And his director, a new master of the genre. Left me dubious. When you look at it, it's a very dull and unoriginal movie. Making others ideas its own, and wanting you to believe it comes from the genius mind of its creator...

93,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Unlike mother! (2017), Hereditary uses allegory to its advantage and is genuinely terrifying.",10,16 July 2018,"Hereditary feels like it was conceived as a response to horror films like the Paranormal Activity films, in that horror films have never been jump-scare dependent fests; and that they can be scary in how uneasy they make you feel as you watch the story unfold on-screen. I could see influences of The Omen, The Exorcist, and mother! (for better or worse). It's got its fair-share of uneasy scares and subtle beat-driven scares and shocks.I can see why some people didn't take too kindly to this movie, and that's fine. My thoughts on the matter though: this film succeeds in telling a story bigger and scarier than any jump-scare fest. Hereditary is a must-see horror movie. And it's a must-see for the 2010s.",Hereditary

96,lambiepie-2,A Horrifying Tale of a Family Possessed,8,10 January 2021,"This film is outstanding. It's disturbing. For some, it can be confusing. Emotionally draining. It builds. It's horrifying, and as a horror fan, this one is quite good.I had to watch the film twice to make sure what I got out of it worked. There is much going on. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD.To me, this is a film of THREE possessions that we will witness. Toni Collette does a more than a reasonable job of playing the mother of a son and a daughter where all three are in various throes of demonic or demonic spirit possession.The story opens with the death of Toni's character' named Annie, mom's death. The grand-mom, of the two children was a practicing Satanist, a Queen for this particular demonic cult you will find out, which is why the family is targeted. She and her following demonic cohorts wished to have the rebirth of a demon named Paimon. Annie and others believed the mom was ""mentally ill,"" which would explain why she didn't pick up on what her mother was really up to.As we tune in, we notice the daughter; Charlie, is a bit off. We also see the son, Peter, is in high school being a typical male teenage boy, thinking about sex, doing drugs, going to parties. Annie is an artist, the father; Steve, played by Gabriel Byrne, works too. It's a decent family. Charlie is an outcast, likes to stay by herself until one night Peter wants to go to a Party and Annie insists that he take Charlie.Charlie goes to the party but gets sick - her throat closes as an allergic reaction to the cake? No. Her brother Peter puts her in the car and tries to get her to a hospital quickly, but tragedy strikes and Charlie dies (and her head is severed, which happened to her grand-mom too). Then all Hell breaks loose.We find out that Charlie was her grandmother's favorite because the grand-mom had Charlie possessed by Paimon, but Paimon could only inhabit a male body to have its rebirth. With Charlie's accident, Paimon is released and begins its possession of Peter. We are watching this demon do its thing step by step into this teenage boy's body. It's NOT a quick possession. We are watching him get taken over slowly until it is tragically final for him, and he is Peter no more.But Annie is also being possessed, and we are watching that unfold as well. Not by Paimon, but by her mom and their demonic cult of spells and Annie's suggestible state until she is completely taken over as well.While Hereditary has some elements of other horror-possession films, this one does stand on its own as we watch the characters succumb to such evil and horror and possession. None of these characters: Charlie, Annie, and especially Peter, have a chance to escape their fates, and that is truly horrifying too.",Hereditary
97,areatw,Good acting but the story is less than convincing,6,5 May 2019,"'Hereditary' contains some effective scare scenes but, rather like a lot of modern day horror films, the focus seems to be on maximising the effect of the jump scares rather than constructing a sound and convincing plot. While it's clear that some effort was put into developing the story and characters early on, I thought the storyline was messy, over-the-top and even quite silly towards the end.By far the most impressive aspect of 'Hereditary' is the acting. Toni Collette has always impressed me in the roles I've seen her in previously and she is again excellent in the lead role in this film. Milly Shapiro also deserves a mention for an effectively creepy and disturbing performance as the daughter. They make the film watchable and probably a lot scarier than it would have otherwise been. A few good scare scenes here and there, but ultimately a weak and unconvincing plot lets 'Hereditary' down.",Hereditary
98,proud_luddite,"It starts well, then descends to hell",5,24 July 2018,"In a rural area of the U.S., Annie Graham (Toni Collette) has recently lost her mother. During the grief and another tragedy, Annie's curiosity of the supernatural leads to some very haunting discoveries and experiences for her and her family.As a director, Ari Aster (also the film's writer) is very talented in keeping an audience on needles and pins. The atmosphere is always intense; even when very little may be happening, there is anticipation and a fear of what might possibly happen next - even if nothing actually happens. Collette is also very strong as the central character dealing with tragedy, grief, and chaos. Other cast members also do fine work.The film is at its most powerful when dealing with the second tragedy and different sides of anguishing guilt. If only it had stayed on this path and not descended to hell in more ways than one.""The Exorcist"" (1973) is probably the prototype for graphic horror films. No matter how shocking and gory it was, within its supernatural, created universe, the story was consistent and even fascinating. Since then, many of its impersonators have upped the gore but gone downhill where intelligent narratives are concerned. ""Hereditary"" is not terribly gory (compared to other modern films) but it does not advance the horror genre as its narrative is too busy and far-fetched.The early occult scenes in the film are fascinating. From there, it has the intention of being frightening. It might have succeeded if it made any actual sense. It didn't. It was also too long.",Hereditary
99,saptesh786,"Grandmother, mother and daughter all for ghost !",4,11 March 2019,"I just saw Hereditary. It is a horror movie. However it is not so perfect. The story is as simple as confused too. I don't understand what is going on the screen and what the next and what is end? No ghost, no jump scares only ugly scences of insects crawling and invisible existence of dead people. What they want? This unanswered situation continues till the end, which makes us disconnect from the movie. Only at end we can find answers of all the questions but leaving also many loopholes backside to think you again about that. This is bothering the spirit of the movie. The story must have its power to bind you with interest till last moment. Here movie fails. Then even from horror genre I do not recommend it much. If you can avoid it would be better. Acting side is okay. Annie (Toni Collette) is perfect for fearful daughter and caring mother's role. Alex Wolff has no expression only plain face for his role of Peter. Whereas Charlie looking mysterious than innocent. And Gabriel Byrne as Steve looking dumb in sometimes. Planchetee is doing here a role to talk with soul of dead people but unfortunately that scenes are wind up in hurry. All the charm of such interesting thing went in vain.
Overall not recommended so. Avoid if you can. It is ridiculous to see such movie got high rated like 7.3?",Hereditary
100,maurice_yacowar,Domestic horror turns into pagan cult,7,14 June 2018,"Annie is an artist who makes dioramas. Instead of preparing for her next show, though, she is obsessed with constructing miniatures of her current home life, from her daughter's attic bedroom to the scene of her fatal road accident. 
 The first of Annie's delicately detailed boxes opens into her real world home. That means her real rooms seem to shrink into tight boxes, with constricting panelled hallways and oppressive beamed ceilings. 
 More importantly, as son Peter discovers, the real narrative of his life is not what's happening in his social, family and school existence, but on a higher plane altogether, where he is slated to serve a higher purpose. From that outside perspective his world shrinks to little boxes. 
 In his school scenes dissections of classical tragedy, politics and economics seem to evaporate as Peter is drawn into his larger destiny.
 The film is a kind of Rosemary's Granny. The presiding demonic power is the grandmother whose obituary and funeral open the film. A private, secretive, strong woman, she turns out to have been the high priestess of a satanic order. Her primary aide Joan is played by Ann Dowd, drawing on associations with her role as stern housemother in The Handmaid's Tale. 
 As the title suggests, we see three generations of witch hood. The priestess's daughter Annie performs the necessary rituals and infernal sacrifices. For most of the film we read the psychodrama as Annie's story, buffeted between two deaths, mother then daughter. She struggles to sustain maternal sensitivity. That's where the film is most powerful, when it situates a nightmare danger in our centre of emotional connection, the mother.
 When the drama shifts from family to cult, the key force becomes Annie's daughter Charlie (granny's favourite). She provides the spirit to be transferred into brother Peter's body so he can rule as King Paimon. The girl's androgynous name prepares for that transfer, as does her eerily otherworldly mien. As befits children innocently trapped in a larger destiny, Charlie and Peter both have severe problems breathing. 
 Curiously, for a film that celebrates the supernatural power of women - a common terror among male filmmakers - the women end up needing a male to lead them, in body if not in spirit. Of course they first have to pound him into shape and inject the feminine spirit - but even that mythology worships the male. 
 Are we to find that reassuring?",Hereditary

This movie was such emotional agony at times,,, then,, the ending really throws you for a loop,, bc you will not see it coming.For anyone who wants to bravely/foolishly watch this,, make sure you have something really funny and lighthearted to watch immediately after,, trust me,,, but,,,DON'T WATCH IT IF YOU'RE FAINT OF HEART!!!Ok,, I'm coming back after watching it several times - 06/09/21My first reaction to this film was a freaked out one to say the least,,, but after watching it several times (at least 3,, maybe 4) I really do see the brilliance behind what Aster did and why/when.

Alex Wolff in that scene in the class ""which was shown in the trailer"" my goodness that was creepy.. the girl Milly Shapiro did very well too.final thought ,, the movie is a step-up in the genre so if you haven't watched it ,, go now and do it .. because it'll be mentioned as part of the Horror movies waking up revolution in a couple of years.",Hereditary
103,educallejero,You had a PERFECT psychological horror... and the ending made it a good paranormal flick,8,4 September 2018,"What a waste. The first hour is INSANE. The writing is as good as the Godfather or any drama ever. The acting is sensational (Toni Collette, more than anything).And then... slowly... the movie transforms itself into a more typical possession/ghost/cult/insanity/etc type of horror movie. 
You have to watch this... You don't need to give into the exagerated praise... 
Its good. 
Could've been perfect.(The family dinamics after a death in the family are portrayed as well as possible. There are psychological traits for different characters that are interesting and original, and are all well done. How different members of a family deal with tragedy is excellent. Im pretty sure there is a lot of interesting symbolism, but I have to see it again for that. The point is: All that is presented and then thrown away for a purposely confusing conclusion that is just a cheap way of escaping the responsability of answer the questions the movie presented).",Hereditary

105,aciessi,The Scariest Film of the Last Decade.,10,7 August 2020,"An instant classic masterpiece horror film. It's the only way you can describe Hereditary. Ari Aster is the most hyped up-and-coming filmmaker of the past two years. Hereditary was his debut, and holy hell, is it a debut. Aster is now two feature films deep into what we definitely know will be a long and prolific film career for him, and yet, it feels as though he's been with us for a long time already. That's because Hereditary does just about everything right in a horror film. Right out of the box, that's incredibly rare for any filmmaker. Even the greatest ones of all time (Scorsese, De Palma) had to work out a few of the kinks in their earlier works. Hereditary is nearly flawless in that sense. A student of horror going all the way back to the originals, Ari Aster has it down to a science just how effectively terrifying a horror film can be. Hereditary is a terrifying movie, in a time when not much can scare us anymore.A family grieves. First, they grieve the elder matriarch who's passed on out of old age. It's a sad day for them, but they just don't feel a true connection to the dead. At least not like they will in the end. Strange things begin occurring. Visions of the grandmother begin appearing around the house. The young daughter, Charlie, begins doodling disturbing images in her note pad and even cuts off the head of a dead pigeon. One night, her older brother Peter takes her to a teenage house party since her mother can't babysit her. After ingesting a slice of chocolate cake (with nuts) she has an allergic reaction, and is rushed to the hospital. On the way, and nearly choking to death as she gasps for air, she rolls down the window in a desperate attempt to breathe, only to be decapitated by a metal pole. It's the worst, bloodiest, cruelest accident anyone can imagine and Peter is culpable. Shattered, and emotionally spiraled, Annie (the mother) consults a spiritual medium that she meets at grief consulting, who teaches her how to perform a seance. When Annie tries to perform it at home, she contacts the spirit of Charlie, along with tremendous evil from the other world. All hell, literally, breaks loose.Hereditary gives a nod to some of the greatest supernatural horror films. Rosemary's Baby, The Shining and Poltergeist just to name a few. But the amount of natural unease and sheer terror this film is able to produce really reminded me of The Exorcist, perhaps my all-time favorite horror film. The scares aren't uneven. They build and build, and crescendo at the end. They thrive on shock value, and never relent. But in the case of this film, there's a post-modern edge it masters. Aster recognizes that it takes a lot to break a desensitized audience. So, as a result, he absolutely goes for broke. Charlie's death and the reaction to it is well enough to shatter your nerves entirely. It's obscene, and graphically grotesque. Aster has the audacity to leave nothing to the imagination on that front. At first, that struck me as a bit unnecessary. It's far more terrifying in what you don't see in horror, as opposed to what you do see. But yet, what you see here is entirely the point. What follows next builds on that visual horror, similarly to what psychological horror already accomplishes. The psychological and visual horror builds on top of each other here. That's what makes Hereditary so unforgettable.But, if that weren't enough for you, then there's Toni Collette. She gives, arguably, the best horror performance of the 21st century so far. Pure, raw, hysterical terror. Think of the final girl from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the mother in The Exorcist. Annie represents a terror that breaks a person entirely. A psychological torment that drives you mad. She's so scared, she's crazy. That's what truly makes for unforgettable horror acting. Toni Collette deserved, at the very least, an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in 2018.",Hereditary
106,rockman182,Hereditary (2018),8,12 June 2018,"Everyone's favorite production company (A24), comes back with a much anticipated horror film. I liked the trailer for this, despite feeling like it didn't reveal a whole lot. Also the film seemed to get a lot of early hype, and I'm not just talking about the parents and kids panicking when they accidentally showed this trailer at a screening of Peter Rabbit. The film earned high praise early on but of course I had to see this for myself. I've let the viewing sink in and I know that I really like this film despite it being full of questions.The film follows a family after the death of the grandma. The family initially seems to be at odds with one another. We soon find out that the daughter of the family, Charlie, was close with her grandmother. Charlie is the type who is quiet and has odd mannerisms including a clucking sound. Without saying much more, the family experiences tragedy and find out that things aren't what they seem as they feel like they are being haunted by an evil presence.It is so hard to talk about the plot without revealing something crazy. Just watch this film. Its not a conventional horror film, the film is almost entirely devoid of jump scares and does not really and scaring you in the moment. The film is more cerebral; its a psychological film that is engorging from beginning to end. Its shot extremely well, and is detail oriented. Ari Aster absolutely knocks it out of the park in his film debut. There are things and moments in this film that I still question, and I feel like the director leaves many clues and easter eggs throughout. This film demands a second watch.I don't see Toni Colette in many films but my god she is amazing in this. Absolutely portrays every emotion perfectly. You see the rage, depression, fear, and absolute terror all emoted on her face. Such great praise for her and Alex Wolff who was also excellent. Lets not forget Ann Dowd as well, she's always solid in everything she's in and does not disappoint here either. The performances really add to the aura of what you are seeing on screen.This film has some really memorable scenes. I don't get scared by horror films but this one really has scenes that are brilliant. I was even laughing hysterically at some parts and finding myself surprised by what transpires. I think everyone should try to see this and unpack what this film offers. I will say though, I thought the ending could have been better and feel like there are things in the film that demanded explanation. Its fine though, this is one of the best films of the year so far.8/10",Hereditary
107,RforFilm,Hereditary truly is scary. It throws you into a nightmare and understands the simple fear of mental illness,9,11 June 2018,"Having a mental illness is enough to be frightening. When you're in that state in which you have no idea whether your thoughts are your own or a manifestation of the illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar, or even depression. All these can cause sudden changes that are never that of the person's character, but of the cause of a chemical imbalance. Now how about we add a supernatural element into the mix, and you have another layer of mystery. You may notice that a lot of the best ghost stories include people that usually have a mental illness or a secret background. Either elements cleverly add to unbalance of the character, making their situation and our viewpoint as an audience more frightening. Movies like The Haunting, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and The Conjuring feature characters with the previously stated attributes that added to the film's suspenseful tone without going too over-the-top. One notion that's not addressed too often in movies about mental illness is the hereditary aspect. Those of us who've grown up with a family history of that can be scared themselves that destiny will force them with the same problems. Hereditary brilliantly adds many layers to that fear along with a ghost story.A miniature artist Annie Graham (played by Toni Collette) is in the middle of dealing with her mother Ellen's passing. At the funeral, she mentions that she had a shaky relationship with her, who in return, was a private woman. Her family includes husband Steve (played by Gabriel Byrne), teenage son Peter (played by Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (played by Milly Shaprio). In addition to her daughter being a reclusive oddball, she reveals at a support group that her family has had a history of mental illness. Annie also starts seeing her mother in random spots in the house (even though no one else can see her).Another family tragedy ends up pushing Annie's mental state further until she meets a woman Joan who tells her that the dead can be contacted through a séance. Annie then uses the tricks taught to her to show the family that it's real. Time passes by as more images of the family are heard and seen in ghostly form while the living members each go through their own trials that reveal more about Ellen. Like a lot of horror movies, what's best is what you don't know and Hereditary has those necessary layers. Let's address the most important aspect of it, the characters. Toni Collette proves again that she take the typical ""mom"" trope and give it that extra weight. It helps that along with her family history and the fact she does have a lot on her belt, she still has the motivation to dig deeper on what's going on. This makes the story just as interesting to us as it is to her. Peter Wolff, fresh from the recent Jumanji, looks a little old, but he also balances the stress of being a teenager and the dilemma that he's facing. Finally, I have to give a lot of points to Milly Shapiro for playing what has too be one of the more unsettling performances of the movie.Where Hereditary shines is in it's tone and atmosphere. Walking into this movie is like walking into a true nightmare. There aren't any big fantasy-like set pieces or even a gothic house, but it takes the kind of household you might see from an upper class family and make it feel so uncomfortable and unfamiliar that moving forward is like taking a deep breath. It all relies beautifully on the story, which I cannot spoil, but adjusts to the overall mood.Finally, what makes Hereditary such an unforgiving, not pleasant experience is how much it understands the human mind above ghosts. It understands that when we lose someone, we always want to see them one more time, but shudder at the idea of them coming back. It's that genuine feeling of feeling alone in a familiar environment that makes it scary. I'll admit that without spoiling anything, the movie's distinct 2 acts will feel jarring for a mainstream audience expecting one outcome. I really enjoyed this and I think a lot of horror fans will do so too, but I can see this being disliked by people who expect something more straightforward.I'll give this nine miniature rooms out of ten. I really liked Hereditary. We seem to be living in an era where the best original ideas come from the horror genre. This adds to the originality we're capable of. If your up for walking into a nightmare, see Hereditary.",Hereditary
108,rzajac,"Not for me: Superb technically, lacking narratively",5,18 September 2018,"Subject sez all, but here's some elaboration.Beautifully produced: Fantastic and captivating in every sense. But it runs off the rails about 1/2-way through. The simple way to describe it might be ""producers' cold-feet syndrome,"" where the money people didn't trust that the flick's maintaining tone, plus the planned narrative end-game, would put butts in the seats and recoup expenses. So they just ran roughshod over the director and turned the thing into a weird spook house cavalcade. There was some tying together of the first and last halves of the flick, using the grandmom as a ligature, but I didn't buy it.Of course, there's a chance the film got made as planned, and the planning for the narrative direction was just screwed up from the get-go.The film's technical mastery starts out so great, I'd almost be tempted to advise that you rent it just to watch the first half. But in the end, ... that's a dumb idea. Forget I suggested it.I was looking forward to Byrne cutting another notch representing his contribution to another noble artistic effort!

Debutante writer-director Ari Aster has given us one of the best horror movies of all time. There are some absolutely terrifying & shocking moments in the film. I even jumped out of my skin a couple of times, which rarely happens to me even during really good horror/thrillers. You are constantly on the edge of your seat, as the suspense & tense atmosphere is maintained throughout. What makes this movie unforgettable, are the performances. Toni Collette has given the performance of a lifetime as Annie. Collette portrays various emotions both subtle & not so subtle, effortlessly. Gabriel Byrne is superb as Steve. Alex Wolff is brilliant as Peter. Milly Shapiro is spectacular as Charlie. Shapiro is a powerhouse of talent in her acting debut. Milly Shapiro is going to have a long & amazing acting career.

110,bankofmarquis,Ridiculous,4,28 June 2018,"For me, the hardest genre of film to get right is horror. In short order the filmmaker needs to set up the premise and ""rules of engagement"" of the world that is being presented and then execute incredulous situations and predicaments in such a way that are plausible and tense. Only a small amount (let's say 10% to be generous) gets this balance right. 80% of the time, they fall short and either the film is boring or (more often) turns into a ""gore-fest"". And...in the bottom 10% are the films where they miss so spectacularly that you are entertained by how ridiculous and over-the-top things are.Such is the case with Ari Aster's HEREDITARY, a film that was billed as a ""tense, thriller with unthinkable family tragedy that veers into the realm of the Supernatural"".I would bill it as ""stupid"".Starring the usually reliable Toni Collette as Annie, a miniature-model artist (people in these types of films usually have occupations that make no sense) who's relationship with her mother is strained - at best. She is married to Steve (Gabriel Byrne - far removed from his USUAL SUSPECTS days), and has 2 children, Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro). They had another child who has passed away. When Annie's mother dies, Annie starts to discover disturbing secrets about her mother and her family's heritage.I won't say more - for I would spoil things - but the film starts promisingly enough - and there's an unexpected, tragic death that I thought was handled interestingly enough and I had positive hopes for the rest of the film - but the scenarios and escalating events of this film build on each other from there, one more ridiculous than the other. I kept wanting to scream to the screen - ""call the authorities"", which would have ended things right there, but this being a film, no one ever does.As I stated, Toni Collette is, usually, a sign of quality in a movie...but not here. She (and Byrne) are listed as Executive Producers of this film (which means, I think, they gave up parts of their salaries for % points in this film - good luck getting any money out of that). Her Annie is melodramatic and over-the-top - and CRAZY - almost from the start, so when she starts getting REALLY melodramatic and C-R-A-Z-Y, it is laughable. Gabriel Byrne walks through this film looking like he is wondering where the Craft Services truck is, giving a ""minimalist"" performance (read: he mailed it in). And the two kids are haunting...in their blankness and blandness.But...it is the ever increasing bizarre events that had me howling with laughter in my seat (as opposed to squirming in terror). I would spoil things if I mentioned them, but I didn't buy any of it. Writer/Director Aster just kept throwing one event even more ""weird"" and bizarre than preceding one. I actually said to my buddy sitting next to me at one point, ""who is that old, fat, naked guy, and where did he come from""?I think that says it all.I'm sure there was probably a good movie in here someplace, this wasn't it.Letter Grade: C (for the opening 1/2 hour or so and the ""unexpected death"" that was executed well).4 stars (out of 10) and you can take it - or leave it - to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Hereditary

112,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Hereditary is the most masterfully and deeply intelligently made horror film I've seen in decades.,10,10 September 2018,"Hereditary is the most masterfully and deeply intelligently made horror film I've seen in decades. I am old enough to remember having seen The Exorcist when it premiered in 1973 and this is the best possession film since that classic. But this film is deeper in metaphors and subtle imagery than even the Exorcist. I watched it four times and each time I still uncover something said and something seen in the periphery of the frame I hadn't seen before. This is truly a horror film for thinking adults tired of a cheaply made quick money grab jumpscare movies. This film rewards viewers who are patient enough to look deeper ""between the lines"" visually to understand a troubled family with a curse. The story is so neatly tied together that things you will overlook during your first viewing of the film will have ties to scenes later in the film. You will know what those are only after a second or third viewing. In other words, the screenplay was not thrown together haphazardly like too many other horror films are. It is very well planned out. The story slowly penetrates the mind and stimulates you mentally with real horror.The film has beautifully filmed cinematography and a cast of extremely talented actors, both young and older talent. Holy cow, Toni Collette has given the best acting performance of any film I've seen in 2018. Horror films are usually snubbed by film awards like the Oscars so it saddens me that Collette's talents might go unappreciated because Hereditary is a horror film. When Collette screams and cries for the loss of one of her children, those screams penetrated and unnerved me. To me, those screams and cries were real. Horror movies like this one are rarely seen today. The best horror films start off as a serious drama that comes to catastrophic tragedy and a teaching point about real life. Hereditary accomplishes this goal.Yes, I would put this film in the same league as the Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and Kubrick's Shinning. Director Ari Aster did his homework and research the topic on Satanism as one of the characters in the film, the demon Paimon is rooted in the real world beliefs by people who follow Satanism. You could seriously google Paimon and the characteristics for which this evil deity is known for and see and then connect the dots to the subtle scenes in the film that Paimon is responsible for. You will miss those until you read up on who is Paimon. It also has the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen on film when I first watched in the theater. I could not get the accident images out of my head for days after having seen it. The Exorcist is the only other horror film that has ever done that to me. Director Ari Aster and his director of photography, Pawel Pogorzelski will be on my future radar. I just hope they don't turn out to be a one trick pony like M. Night Shyamalan and The Six Sense because both these men have given me hope for truly wonderful horror films in the future.",Hereditary

But the film reveals that grandma had installed assistant devil Paimon in the body of a young girl who eats a piece of chocolate cake at a party and through a bad reaction to it ends up dying in an accident. Lets think about that for a moment. His darkly evilness who the devil worship cult work looking up to to do some serious badness can't even control his host body to stop his throat from swelling. What good is he going to be in the rapture.

Some even went so far as to say ""Hereditary"" saves the horror industry! Rubbish. It was a tedious chore to sit through. Toni Collette's acting was on point, though and I wouldn't be surprised if she gets nominated for an Academy Award. That said, Gabriel Byrne was under utilized. The son looks nothing like anyone else in the house. Not only did he look much older than a high school senior but he also looked Middle Eastern. The writing in the movie was what really ruined it. Without giving out spoilers, let's just say the story made no sense and only propelled the movie to what must be the most ridiculous ending in all of moviedom.

The film follows a family (pretty disjointed one at that!) where the grandmother dies and some creepy events take place over the next hour and a half amongst the remaining family members.I'm not going to spoil the details for you but the only positive I see from this film is a pretty good performance from Toni Collette (who I kept thinking was going to break into a nightmare version of the Australian, Muriel in Muriel's Wedding!).I went to the cinema showing (unwittingly) expecting a horror film in the mould of The Exorcist and I was let down. You see I was taken in by the clever marketing campaign that compares this film to such horror classics as the aforementioned The Exorcist. Nowhere near and a bad comparison.I should have seen the warning signs. I mean a 15 rated film! How can that live up to real horror. It is more kiddie horror used by studios to maximize audiences. The music score (especially over the end credits) reminded me more of the cult music of the islanders on The Wicker Man!

118,mikayakatnt,REAL HORROR,10,22 March 2020,"Holy. Cow.Hereditary is 2/3rds slow burn that comes crashing down in the final act.There were moments I wondered if I was still watching a scary movie. Yet, each little detail and seemingly useless line of dialogue holds a deeper meaning. The amount of foreshadowing in this film is insane. These deeper layers mean re-watchability time and time again... not that I would want to watch it again.The cinematography takes an interesting direction as well. Ari Aster shows innovation even with the first dollhouse to movie-start scene. Some of the scenes, transitions, and long shorts are spectacular and unnerving. The soundtrack, and sometimes lack of sound, adds to the terror. Slow, unnerving shots keep the audience on edge. And Ari Aster takes no reservation on disturbing visuals through the film. Expect a wild ride.Everyone's performance in this film is jaw dropping and believable. From Annie's (Toni Collette) slow breakdown, Peter's (Alex Wolff) teenage angst, and Charlie's (Milly Shapiro) awkward kid phase.

119,kjproulx,A Dramatic Mind Trip Of A Horror Film,8,9 June 2018,"Movies like Hereditary don't come around often enough, and that's sadly due to the fact that audiences usually don't flock out to see films that look abstract. Horror films have been on a very big high over the last few years, giving us thrilling films like Get Out or Don't Breathe, or more recently, the fantastic movie A Quiet Place. The latest wide release in this genre comes in the form of A24's Hereditary. This studio is known for releasing superb content but mostly goes under the radar. While this film surely isn't for everyone, the sheer originality behind it makes it well worth seeing in theatres. From its atmosphere to its creepy imagery, to the downright unnerving performances, here's why Heredity should be on your list of thrillers/horrors to see.The plot of this film itself is a spoiler, so I'm going to dance around that a bit here. The Grandmother of the Graham family has passed away and they're slowly trying to recover from that tragic event when surprises and secrets about their lineage come to light. That's about as simple as the plot can be put without having seen the film. The originality of the film comes in the form of the premise that has to be undisclosed until you see the film for yourself. I thought I knew what this film was going to be like when watching the trailers, but trust me when I say it's not and you're either going to love or hate the routes that this movie takes.For a film like this that relies so heavily on a family aspect, the performances need to be top notch in order to hold my interest. Toni Collette has been an actress that I've kept my eye on over the years, as I was positive she would eventually blow me away. Hereditary is absolutely that performance in my opinion. Yes, Milly Shapiro is great and Alex Wolff has his moments, but Collette acts circles around everyone throughout this film. She brought me to tears, had me gasping for air when she was monologuing, and frankly had my jaw on the floor with how realistic her performance was from beginning to end. Never breaking characters and truly making me believe I was watching a troubled mother, she sucked me right into the atmosphere of the movie.I've been hearing nothing but praise for this movie and while it definitely deserves to be talked about, I definitely had some issues with it. At times it does feel like a generic horror flick in the way that it presents certain spiritual elements or supernatural storylines, but if you can suspend your disbelief or just happen to believe in certain things, then you may be fine. I was easily able to attach myself to what was happening, but it felt like a tonal shift at times. On top of that, this movie asks a lot of you throughout the final act, which I absolutely loved, but I didn't feel quite satisfied. There is a lot of effort put into this film in terms of its cinematography and dark themes (which I have to commend), but I find myself continuously questioning certain things long after my viewing of the film. Normally I would love that, but the more I think about it just makes me wish for a slightly different ending. Hereditary is a very ambitious movie in the way that the story continues to surprise you and I personally loved watching every second of it, but looking back on the movie as a whole, I just find myself wondering if I'll ever want to watch it again. There are some very disturbing images spread throughout the film and I genuinely had goosebumps on multiple occasions, but where the film ends up throughout the conclusion left me slightly unsatisfied. This is a fantastically constructed film from start to finish, but it's not for everyone and I can see many people finding aspects of this film humorous if they're not buying into it. For myself, it's a great movie that deserves to be seen, but be ready for gruesome images, supernatural turns, and some bizarre and surprising moments.",Hereditary
120,kuarinofu,"Has its moments, but doesn't really achieve anything",7,15 September 2018,"I was unable to finish this movie in one sitting, mostly due to a very slow pace and quite a significant runtime it has. Yet I finished it, and this is what I can sum up:
1. The movie picks up and forgets subplots randomly. For example, this could've been a good psychological drama, but they just abandoned this element of the film by the end.
2. As it builds up it gets very confusing and convoluted, just because a logical human brain cannot process the kind of plot they are going for here. It just doesn't make much sense. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy this one. It is quite departed from reality.
3. The ending just made the movie worse. The fact that their initial plot is so hard to swallow made them record a voice over to explain what actually happened. Not good.
4. Casting was good and most of the acting was as well. For some reason it feels like only Gabriel Byrne was somehow underperforming, I guess mostly because of the writing (he didn't have much to do either).
5. Horror elements in this were ups and downs, some of them worked well (like the elements borrowed from classic horrors of the 70's - creepy faces, walking corpses, the use of color in lighting - like Argento did in Suspiria and more). Some of the elements borrowed from modern horrors were misplaced and made it look like a comedy (I actually chuckled once).
Overall, this is a very long and slow mediocre horror with a couple of effective scares and tightly acted psychological drama elements that builds up good tension only to confuse you and kick you in the balls with an unsatisfactory ending. It's up for you to decide whether you want to watch something like this or not.
P.S. Some elements of the production were sloppy, for ex.: if you look closely you can see the strings pulling the pages of the notepad, some of the sound effects were not in sync (like the attic headbanging) and stuff. This kind of stuff is not healthy for the overall atmosphere.",Hereditary

This time, I could focus more and watch it in better quality.One of the creepiest movie that I have watched. The depiction of paranoia and insanity that seemingly trickled down the family made me feel more and more on the edge of my seat.Tony Collete was haunting as the erratic and unstable mother. She single-handedly elevated the creepiness of this movie. I got stressed out whenever she snapped. The daughter was also creepy. Her presence maintained the uneasiness of the first half of the runtime.The plot was also interesting. It did a great job at mixing with the mental health of the characters. The last 30 minutes or so was spine-chilling and horrifying. Scenes where people and shadows standing in the background without any loud noise were more effective than any typical jump-scares.Overall, a masterfully-made horror and drama about mental illness. 9.5/10.",Hereditary
122,tm-sheehan,"This is not the 21ST Century ""The Exorcist"" !",4,31 August 2018,"Wasn't going to give my review of this movie because a friend recommended it and obviously had a different view of it than I but isn't that what being critical is all about so all I'll say is Toni Collette is a terrific actress and I look forward to her next movie.
I loved the Sixth Sense in which Toni also played a mother of a very disturbed child but that was a great script and truly scary and disturbing.
I'd like to ask Toni Collette the same question I'd have asked Helen Mirren, about her role in the movie Winchester , why did they appear in these movies, and what did they think when they watched the final cut?
The family in this movie makes The Addams Family look normal .The children especially Alex Wolff, who plays Peter gives a good performance but doesn't look as though he belongs ethnically or emotionally to the family. The daughter played by Milly Shapiro looks odd and unattractive from the beginning, perhaps that's intentional but her character doesn't have time to develop.
I like a good scary movie but after over 2 hours I could only think at the end that the script writer and production team couldn't work out a credible ending. If they had of just ended the movie 20 minutes before rather than add a selection of unattractive spooks and paranormal paraphernalia, which was more humorous than spooky I'd have thought more about Hereditary.",Hereditary
123,DarthVoorhees,Phenomenal build up of suspense and dread that unfortunately leads up to a pretty unoriginal 'Rosemary's Baby' remake,8,12 September 2018,"I had some very mixed feelings about this one. I went into it completely cold, only knowing that it was extremely polarizing but that the people who loved it are heralding it as a generational horror film. It's excellent until it gets to it's second act and so in essence the pay off cannot match the build up. Which is a shame because 'Hereditary' expertly does what a great horror film should do, it builds dread to palpable levels. This I think is in thanks to it's cast which is top notch(with one notable exception). Toni Collette should generate Best Actress consideration. Milly Shaprio as the doomed daughter Charlie is outstanding at being sad and creepy with an utmost minimalist performance. Gabriel Byrne rounds out the cast with an excellent performance of his own. He plays the horror skeptic very well. He's always had a lot of gravitas and that reacting to the horror lends it's self well to the uncertainness of what is happening.So much of 'Hereditary' is reading between the lines and seeing the subtext behind the characters. That is a mark of great writing and great acting. As I said before the best thing about the film is the sense of dread hanging over it. It is a taut spellbinder where we truly feel as if something horrible can happen at any minute.Eventually though we get to the explanations behind the ghouls and witchcraft and then a lot of the good will the film built up goes away. It's too loud. And that one notable exception really stands out. I think Alex Wolff as Peter is a major disappointment. There's no real build up to his performance. He goes into histrionics almost immediately and so the character doesn't seem like he has any dimension to him. The last act of the film is entirely based on his reaction to the horror and his over punctuation seems kind of silly.The 'Rosemary's Baby' remake the film eventually becomes has been told so many ways before. It's shot well but it isn't original. It's too loud too for a film that in it's best moments plays it close to the chest. It would have been a better movie had it been a more macabre psychological drama about grief and fear in the aftermath of a loss.",Hereditary

132,rajdoctor,Conceived / pitched as a family drama - but shot as HORROR,7,9 September 2018,"I had heard good critics reviews of this film. Later it was recommended by my friend, thus I had to watch it.I am an ardent fan of Toni Collette since the Sixth Sense and Little Miss Sunshine days (both movies I have seen more than 6 times).Miniature specialist Anne Graham (Toni Collette) lives with her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), son Peter (Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). When Anne's mother dies, Anne confesses her frightful relationship with her mother at the funeral eulogy and mental illness running in her family at the counseling support group.. In a freak car accident when Charlie's head is decapitated while Peter is driving, strange events unfolds. Anne is helped by Joan (Ann Dowd) a member of counseling group to communicate with Charlie through séance. More ghostly events occur resulting in the finale where the whole family dies to join as coven members headed by Paimon spirit.The screenplay writer director Ari Aster after giving a short film The Strange thing about the Johnsons in 2011; directs his first feature length film debut terming the movie as tragedy turning to a nightmare rather than a horror movie; shot the movie on a set stage (and outdoors set of the house) in just 32 days.Most of the script is well connected and aptly executed. But Aster falters in the final run. A movie that had all the potential to become a master-piece like Omen or Shining, fails in the end.But taking that aside, and few other nit-picks (why one did / did not do this?) here and there, the movie is good. It grips the audiences throughout with punctuated props as each relating events unfolds. Nothing seems to be out of place. Toni Collette (who liked the script so much that accepted the film even though she did not want to do dark, heavy movies) and Alex Wolff (HairBrained and Coming through the Rye fame) act brilliantly and both may deserve award nominations. The setting, cinematography (Pawel Pogorzelski) and music play their role to enhance the eerie atmosphere. With the budget of USD 10 million , it has already earned more than USD 80 million as a box-office success with critical appreciation. A good addition to the horror genre.

When I heard that it was being made by some of the same people who worked on The Witch (which some people didn't like, but I liked it), I had high hope for this film, and boy was I not disappointed. Such a breath of fresh air for the genre in a time where Hollywood has prostituted it and released nothing but garbage. Not only was the film scary as hell, but it also had a lot to say about grief and trauma. The way the film is put together is its strongest part. The pacing, the editing, the cinematography, and the sound design all worked together to create a truly unique and hellish vision of horror. I'm a horror veteran, and rarely actually jump or feel tense, but this film made me feel like a horror virgin again, actually frightening me like no other Hollywood film can.The acting was also superb all around and only adds to the horror being presented on screen. Each character was unique and added their own style to this modern horror masterpiece. I saw many people in the theater jumping and looking away, some being grown men. A couple people even left, and I can't imagine its because they felt it was a bad film, because it was not. I am seriously considering going and seeing it again which hasn't happened since the Evil Dead remake and The Raid.

136,Alexander_Blanchett,What a ride,9,17 June 2018,"A very good horrortrip. Got me chills and at the edge of my seat like hardly any other horror movies in recent years. There were really nice twists and the film made you guessing the outcome all the time, giving you hints and misleads. 
Toni Collette was absolutely fabulous. A truly raw and outstanding performance. There is so much going on with her character and the different emotions, thrills, crazes she goes through and all of that is wonderfully put together by the machine of a performance Collette delivered. I really hope, now that after ""Get Out"" the door is open for Horror films, she will actually get the recognition she deserves. 
The rest of the cast is good as well, especially Alex Wolff was outstanding. First of all I was not sure if I liked his performance or character but the more he developed the greater Wolff became. It was nice to see Gabriel Byrne again and he delivered a very decent performance as well. Ann Dowd is always a pleasure to see on screen. Milly Shapiro is an excellent new comer and also she had some really memorable moments. Great direction, editing and one of the scariest scores since ""The Shining"" make this a true horror ride in the total sense of the word. The final twist was the only thing that did not work too well with me, however I think if the film grows on me that impression will change again.",Hereditary

I can appreciate the good production values and some great acting, especially Toni Collette who should get an Academy Award nom for her effort. In fact, her unraveling recalls Shelley Duvall's performance in ""The Shining"". And there was the unsettlingly weird look of newcomer Milly Shapiro who I thought was the little girl in ""Les Miserables"" but no. This film was more a study of the descent into madness/psychosis that was colored with horror. It wasn't a horror genre film like Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. But because it's a story about madness some of the scenes are difficult to understand and to determine if they're ""real"" or part of the character's madness. I'm a dude and not easily scared or intimidated so this film rather than scaring me was just more unsettling and disturbing, it left me in a bad mood, especially with the very odd, weird, again unsettling final scene. It was good for what it is, but I don't like what it is so I guess that rates a ""6"", very hard to rate.",Hereditary
139,apryla-58795,What in the world????!!!!,3,11 January 2019,"I don't even know what I watched just now. It seemed like this was the slowest movie ever. Some parts were so slow that towards the end I got to thinking ""Ok apparently the director just ran out of ideas and decided to drag each scene out way longer than necessary."" Thanks for not trying and for wasting our time.A few thoughts...Alex Wolff did not look like the rest of the family. Not sure why they couldn't find an actor who would have looked more like them. Also I can't tell if he's a good actor or not. The whole movie he was literally acting like he was stoned. Standing around with your mouth open does not a good actor make. Plus I know it's nitpicky but why with the mole? Just WHY?! Those things can be removed so it's beyond me why anyone would keep that on their face. It's all you can see when you look at him.Gabriel Byrne was so wasted in this. Why did they even bother with him or a Dad character at all if he was gonna be so minimal?! It was seriously like he wasn't there at all. Plus he looked like Toni Colette's Dad! They had zero chemistry. The age gap-what was that all about?The movie was so dark. I kept checking my screen to make sure it wasn't on nightlight or that I had accidentally turned it down.Toni Collette is usually a sure thing in every role she takes but this I felt was not her best work. I don't know why but it seemed like she didn't know how to do the scene with Gabriel Byrne at the fireplace. It was very awkward. She mostly just stood around with her mouth open.Milly Shapiro-is there something very wrong with her or did they go to extra lengths to make her look like a hobgoblin? I don't want to make fun of a little girl BUT I mean...what is going on with her? She was in this movie for a cup of coffee and that was it. Pointless.The whole family was a bunch of sadsacks. This movie wasn't scary - it was depressing watching them be so dysfunctional and bizarre and that was BEFORE everything went down. What a bunch of weirdos. They had absolutely nothing redeeming about them.Why would you make your teenage son take his sister to a party? Why didn't they make sure she wouldn't eat anything that would cause her throat to close while they were there? The mom just sends her off with the brother without any reminders about that.Why did the brother just go to bed instead of calling the police or his parents when Charlie's head came off?!What in the world was that stuff that Toni Colette was working on? It looked like she was working on something personal and also something for another art exhibit. That made no sense and was super creepy. Why was the grandmother just seen in photos? Why didn't they have flashbacks that showed her to make this more real. We don't know anything about these people therefore I didn't care when any of them died.I'm very disappointed that I wasted my time with this because I had heard it was terrifying and it was anything but! The ending?! I was laughing! It just went completely off the rails and made no sense. I don't even think I could begin to understand what this movie was about even if it was broken down in a very detailed description.Well...cluck cluck.

142,ronakkotian,What true horror is really like,10,20 June 2019,"Hereditary is undoubtedly one of the best horror films I've seen.Horror is a genre that's really looked down upon. It's a very subjective genre and depends upon what scares you. For me, personally, I think Hereditary is one of the scariest films made. I've heard a lot of negative reception about this film where people claim it was boring or not scary. This comes back to when I mentioned how horror is subjective. However, it also made me realise that some people have truly forgotten what horror actually is.Hereditary is Ari Aster's first feature length movie. As I was watching this I knew that this man has a strong passion for his craft. The opening scene alone proved to me how masterful his direction is. Everyone in this movie is downright amazing particularly the performance of Toni Collette which is her career's best and oscarworthy. Her acting as Annie in some of the scenes seem so raw and heartwrenching and makes the film extremely difficult to watch. The cinematography and music work so well together to create an eerie and uncomfortable setting throughout that fully immerses you.The first half of the film is slow but at the same time it's investing as we learn more about each character and their descent into madness. This brings me back to people forgetting what horror is. Nowadays some people go to horror films to get scared instead of watching it for the characters and story. Whilst Hereditary doesn't have cheap tatics to scare people like jumpscares, it uses the idea of family drama, mental illness and people losing their sanity which I believe is truly disturbing. Even though the movie contains creepy imagery and goes supernatural at times, Aster balances each of these themes perfectly. There are images still in my head of some of the events that take place and thinking about them really disturbs me.Honestly, Hereditary is one of the most disturbing films I've seen. There are some definite jaw-dropping moments especially during the last 20 minutes of the films where it becomes unimaginably insane. The outstanding direction by Ari Aster as well as the music and cinematography contribute to the terrifying atmosphere and makes your skin crawl.I would highly recommend this to people who really love horror and movies. However the slow-burn treatment won't work for everyone.",Hereditary
143,garethcrook,It was all going so well...,6,27 December 2019,"The tone is set here within the opening camera track, a slow pan across an attic room with elaborate plans pinned to the wall and an epic diorama style model house. As the camera closes in and locks into one rooms of the house, there's a knock at the door an Gabriel Byrne walks in. This is gonna be good. Add Toni Collette and a clearly offbeat family attending a funeral and things are set to get pretty strange. I'm gonna cut to the chase, I loved this... sort of. Creepy characters, completely relatable moving through scenes of their lives that make your blood run cold and hold your hands to your head in moments of unfathomable discomfort. The supernatural occurrences would in other less considered films annoy me, but here their little subtle interventions work beautifully (to begin with), heightening the tensions and the pain of tragic loss. Byrne is the anchor, the normal in the descending chaos. His togetherness though allows Collette free reign to let loose, she's ferociously brilliant. Yes there are a few tropes and you could say it follows some familiar thriller territory, but for much of the film it's fun. Sadly the final act, perhaps predictably just crosses the line and it goes from interesting supernatural thriller to surreal twoddle. Bloody shame really as it was doing so well. Still, there's some entertaining stuff here and if you can see your way to forgiving the last half hour, it really is quite a good watch.",Hereditary

Well, maybe those classifications are a little bit too much. It's a fine movie and definitely creepy, but ""scariest ever""? Not really. Apart from the one extremely harsh scene with the pivotal accident (I won't give any more away) there's hardly any gore or jump-scares, it's all more atmospheric and sinister.
I think the biggest asset of this movie is the very strong acting, especially by Toni Collette as the heartbroken mother and of Alex Wolff as the son who is petrified by guilt, both are given an excellent psychological depth. In comparison the father-character (Gabriel Byrne) is somewhat pale. The movie gets more and more creepy towards the end and this turns into a first climax when it becomes clear that the haunting images that seemed to be figments of the overwrought mind of the mother are all too real. But then the last scene spoils it al, at least for me, it's as if the makers did a Rosemary's Baby on the viewers, a major twist with which we are supposed to at last get all the answers. But with Rosemary's Baby you could trace the movie back and you were able to connect all kinds of scenes and clous to this solution. Here it comes more or less out of the blue and it felt too easy and a bit preposterous. So to me it was an unsatisfying ending to a for the most part strong movie.",Hereditary

148,davidgee,Some recycling here,7,22 June 2018,"HEREDITARY is a ghost story from the school of INSIDIOUS. An affluent family in a forested town in Utah experience spooky goings-on when a grisly accent kills their young daughter only weeks after they buried their beloved grandmother. The high-school-age son (Alex Woolff) goes rapidly to pieces, as does his mother, played by Toni Collette who makes her the most formidable character in horror movies since Kathy Bates in MISERY. Dad (Gabriel Byrne) tries vainly to hold the family together.The key character in the story is a neighbour, Joan, also bereaved, who dabbles in Ouija-board-style spiritualism. Joan is played by Ann Dowd, whom we know (and fear) as Aunt Lydia in THE HANDMAID'S TALE. Like Aunt Lydia, Joan seems to mean well but we are obviously supposed to wonder about her true intent.The casting of Dowd and Collette lifts this movie above the routine. Writer/director Ari Aster tries to give it the kind of epic 'grandeur' Stanley Kubrick brought to THE SHINING (a much over-rated film, in my opinion: it did not do justice to one of Stephen King's finest novels). HEREDITARY also has echoes of ROSEMARY'S BABY and that hoary old Hammer horror, THE DEVIL RIDES OUT. The ending is totally daft, and really there is very little that's new here, but you get a few nice jumpy moments along the way, and Toni Collette and Ann Dowd work very hard to elevate this story into the Gothic 'pantheon'.",Hereditary

It's a very dark story but then the film makes no apologies; it's refreshing to finally see a completely immersive story that ignores almost all horror film cliches. The hero dies, that's it. But it's how we get there that fascinates, so much so that I watched the film twice and plan to watch it again. Like Rosemary's Baby, the clues build as you go, in subtle ways, and you won't catch them on a first viewing. Toni Collette gives one of her best performances; what she does with her face and voice are sometimes astonishing, whether it's struggling with indecision when she meets Joan or full-bore hysterics when her daughter dies, everything about her character is legitimate. Even before the reveal at the end, I suspected that something was amiss with Charlie; nothing against the actress who plays her, but her odd face, premature development, creepy voice, and strange mannerisms imply that she's something other than what she appears. By far the most amazing scene is the end, and I watched it five times because it's so unexpected and inhuman, so completely dismissive of the struggles of the characters who suffered for it to happen, that it earns authenticity simply because the story has been divorced from any human expectation of a positive ending. The eerie music accompanying the end scene underscores the impression that we're getting a glimpse of hell, and for me it's terrifying. It's not easy to do that, many films have tried and failed.As much as I love this film, there is one corny old horror movie cliche that prevents me from giving it ten stars, and that's the old book that explains everything, with illustrations no less. Here it's a book about witchcraft that grandmother conveniently left among her belongings. The rest of the film is so unique and original that it's rather glaring when this cliche pops up.",Hereditary
151,danielmanson,It just wasn't that good,4,18 February 2019,"There is so many fantastic reviews on this film, some calling it the horror movie of the year. So of course when it came onto Amazon Prime I had to give it a watch. And honestly I just could not get into the film and here's why...It takes way too long to get going. Before you start figuring it all out and ""stuff"" starts happening, it's a good hour and a half into the film. By then, me personally, just didn't feel overly connected anymore.The plot. It is just very very confusing. Due to the slow pace of the film, you are waiting for something to happen. It does. But, you then do not know why. Was it a freak accident? Or something more? It does tell us at the end what is happening, the explanation, I found to be quite loose.The characters are just not likable. This was such an annoying aspect of the film I could simply not get past. Not one character in the family is even slightly likable. What this did was make the audience unconnected to any of them. So if anything happened to them, you won't be that bothered by it.Finally, they kept using the horror cliche of the character slowly turning around. They did this so much throughout the film that is just lost that scare factor. The horror of this happening just became null, because it had happened so much. It became very annoying to watch also, when the same character will do it for the 50th time in 30 minutes. Loses it's touch.These four major points really put me off the film and I just did not connect with it at any point. During midway, I just wanted it to finish.I will say that in terms of the ""horror genre"" it adds a different element. There isn't many jump scares and the ""horror"" element mainly comes from tension and suspense. Obviously, this is subjective and some will find this scary, others will not.Overall, I wouldn't personally watch this. There are much better horror films out there.",Hereditary

155,jordan2240,A Master Class in Over-acting,4,27 March 2019,"Another silly horror film, that while creepy, makes very little sense - or I'm just stupid. Basically, grandma was in a 'Rosemary's Baby' type cult, and upon her death, another member takes charge of having some demon king possess her grandson. Seems that the king had previously inherited the granddaughter, but being male, really wanted to inherit a male. So, in order for this to happen, there had to be decapitations, crawling on ceilings, random sitings of dead people, self hurting, and a pointless torching of dad. All this so the 'king' could inhabit perhaps the wimpiest boy on the planet. And while I'm certain the actors extended huge amounts of energy in their performances, some of the acting is so over-the-top, it crossed the line into humor. The ending just left me shaking my head, wondering why I continue to be 'had' by these supposed horror film.On the plus side, even though much of what happens makes no sense to me, the film did cause me to have some very odd yet creepy dreams involving demons at a golf tournament, which is why I gave it more stars than I think it deserves.",Hereditary
156,baileycrawly,Absolutely Phenomenal,9,17 May 2020,"This is what horror should be as a genre
This isn't a jump scare-dependent movie. In fact, it doesn't even deal strictly in fear. This movie offers up a full range of human emotions, both for the characters and for the viewers. It was really an immersive experience, taking its time to craft a rich and interesting story that you couldn't help but watch no matter how grim the movie eventually became.
The writing was absolutely phenomenal, the script was a harmonious marriage of sound and vision, the acting - with particular nods to Toni Collette and Alex Wolff - was nothing short of perfection, hitting every emotion head-on. There wasn't a moment in this film that took me out of it, in the acting or in the special effects, which are easily the 2 most damning elements of a poorly made movie for me.Overall, this was an extremely well-done movie, and one I would absolutely watch again in the future. This restores my faith in my favorite genre, a landscape that has fallen victim to unsolicited jump scares to maintain its impact. There's none of that in this movie. It lays out a well-written story and earns its scares and suspense genuinely and honestly. It was a pleasure to watch, and I can only hope that this will help set the blueprints for the next wave of horror films, because this is the kind of thing the genre has needed for quite some time.",Hereditary
157,sweidman-28016,The Year's Best,10,28 October 2018,"Hereditary Review:Hereditary is A24's (one of my favorite movie companies) newest horror movie. I don't know where to start. This movie was flawless. A revelation in the horror film genre, granted it's not in my top favorite movies of all time. Ari Aster directed this and it is his first full length feature film. He did amazing. Aster perfected this movie and made it into a masterpiece. This wasn't a horror movie with its typical tropes and jump scares, it was a horror movie. It was more psychological (typical A24 movie) and really got under your skin creating true fear, not just something to jump at and laugh at yourself for. These are the things I look in a great horror movie. I hate jump scares because they're so cheap and fake, unless they're done well (ex.: Insidious). The set design of the movie was gorgeous. The cinematography was beautiful. I loved the suspenseful score. The editing was great. Now let's go on to the acting. I can sense an Oscar nomination for Toni Collette. This role is what people are going to remember her for. She did everything for it. We couldn't tell if she was crazy or not and it made the experience so gripping for audiences. This was the best performance by an actress I have seen all year. The other standout was Alex Wolff. He did so well and made the movie more gripping, just like Toni. This movie was so suspenseful and really creepy. The climax had Krista and I on the edge of our seats. This is the first time I've felt scared while watching a movie since I don't know when. The movie may seem odd and things will feel out of place, but if you stay till the end, it'll all make sense. If you want to see an amazing movie, go see Hereditary. I didn't want to spoil anything and go in open minded. You won't regret it.My Grade: A+",Hereditary

This story is Ideal with those that like to connect the dots and try to find answers to the randomness of life's events.",Hereditary
160,dfle3,This family is uniquely unhappy. 65+%,7,28 June 2018,"Having heard good things about this film on Australian ABC radio (across multiple programmes or segments), I thought I'd watch this. Since I don't really watch commercial TV, I haven't seen any ads for this film, so I'll keep my description of what happens rather vague, so as to not to divulge any spoilers for you. The plot involves the aftermath of the death of the mother of Annie Graham (Toni Collette). As Annie says in her eulogy at the funeral service for her mum, Ellen was a ""secretive"" woman. There are a lot of interesting titbits about Ellen for the rest of the film, as well as for Annie's fraught relationship with her own family (husband Steve, played by Gabriel Byrne, nearly adult teenage son Peter, played by Alex Wolff and their 13-year-old daughter Charlie, played by Milly Shapiro). There are hints of the supernatural in this film and it made me wonder how the rest of the film would unspool...would it be a supernatural horror film or psychological thriller? In either case, the film chooses to reach its conclusion at a funereal pace, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but may not appeal to those who cleave to the fast and easy thrills of Hollywood fare. Some films which ""Hereditary"" brought to mind in terms of pace, characterisation or visuals included ""Rosemary's baby"", ""Pan's labyrinth"" and the rather good if obscure Australian film ""Summerfield"". The first and the last film could be considered good companion pieces to ""Hereditary"", although I wasn't that keen on ""Rosemary's baby"" but did quite like ""Summerfield"". Those other films aren't fresh in my memory and I don't mean to suggest that they are very similar to ""Hereditary""...I just find that there's a certain ""family resemblance"" to them...cousins, so to speak. If you don't mind films which unfold at a measured pace, there is value in viewing each of them. Oh...just remembered...the original ""The wicker man"" is worth mentioning as a ""cousin"" of these films. That being said, there are a couple of gruesome scenes in ""Hereditary"", so the film isn't devoid of some shock value for the unwary. It should also be noted that there is some artifice in ""Hereditary"". For instance, the Graham family is introduced to us via a cinematic device, which did make me wonder what implications that had for what we were about to see. Similarly, there is a scene with a very odd camera angle when showing Annie in a hallway. Maybe you could view that cinematic device as ""Hitchcockian""...and maybe you could also say that it alluded to a later scene with Annie at her home. I also liked the narrative titbits in this film which made me wish that I could rewind the film at the cinema to listen again to some comment or to pause a scene so that I could try and recognise certain symbols or strange objects. Speaking of which, there is also a novel visual cinematic device in this film to bring to the viewer's attention something uncanny occurring.  No spoiler here, but as for the ending, my initial impression was that it had a mystifying conviction, which, in retrospect, I no longer think is accurate. Tongue-in-cheek, you could perhaps say that the ending of the film follows naturally on from the mystifying psychedelic end-sequence of ""2001: A space odyssey"".  Not really a criticism, but I did wonder how the events of the film all cohered to bring you the resolution that is revealed. Were the events leading up to it inevitable? I.e. was the fate of the key character at the end of the film ""ordained"" from the outset, so to speak? This kind of question is what made ""Summerfield"" such a good film, in my view (I've reviewed that title here, as I have ""Rosemary's baby"" and ""Pan's labyrinth"" (which I see that I gave a score of 10/10 to. ""Summerfield"" got 8/10 from me and ""Rosemary's baby"" got 6/10 from me). Still on the ending...I'm wondering how scary that outcome was, considering the domestic nature of much of the preceding drama. I would tend to think that maybe the resolution wasn't as scary at it was (perhaps) intended to be, assuming the ending was intended to be interpreted literally...which it may or may not have been, in any case!Random observations:* The actors playing the children aren't your typical Hollywood film teenagers, visually. Peter didn't even seem to have a family resemblance to Annie and Steve, in which case the casting is a bit odd in that respect...or is it? I dunno!* Maybe there could have been a bit more chills immediately following the wake for Annie's mum, relating to her, before the themes of Annie's loss and grief unspool.* What was that stuff about the black dots or whatever it was which Annie had on her finger? Or the bit where she touches her mum's corpse at the wake? Hmm.* On one film review segment on ABC local radio the reviewer did mention that he thought that Toni Collette could (would?) win an Academy Award for her performance. Toni Collette does get to display scenes of extreme grief, so that may catch the eye of the voters, perhaps.* An interesting reaction from Peter following a shocking event. In a way it was unbelievable and in another way, it was entirely believable.P.S. I'm a big fan of ""The exorcist"", which is another film which does a great job in building tension and not rushing into its shocks. 10/10 from me and also reviewed at this site by me.P.P.S. ...and now I'm wondering how the film's title fits into its meaning...",Hereditary

The gradual revelations of supernatural entities may therefore feel like a bit of a cheat for those less inclined to take them seriously. It is like The Omen, but not played for camp. What worked for me was the combination of banal suburbia with witches covens, something done to even greater effect in Rosemary's Baby (a film that - more effectively I think - never totally went the supernatural route, but lingered at its edges). This is tough viewing because of the underlying themes of loss.. By the end you may feel it has all gone too far, but stylistically it certainly works as pure horror. On the other hand, the husband's character needed to be developed a bit more, and the house is just a bit too dark.",Hereditary

The son character in particular could get silly but works thanks to acting and atmosphere.Certainly a significant horror film because it know how to play by the rules and make them work--lessons many pretender horror films fail to do.Effective music and ironic use of a semi famous ballad for the end credits help a lot. Two lead females characters hold it all together along with the photography and direction.

Is it a movie about the delusions of a crazy person ala BUG or is it about something truly supernatural--or both? I'm betting it's trying to be both but, eh, that just doesn't work because in that case you can't follow anything, nothing makes sense and you can't really get too invested in the characters because you don't know if they're coming out of right or left field.

168,CineMuseFilms,a brilliant psycho-drama becomes an ordinary supernatural fantasy,7,12 June 2018,"It is ironic that the supernatural horror genre needs to be grounded in realism in order to be frightening. The closer a film moves towards fantasy the less realistic and therefore less scary it becomes. Lauded by some as the horror film of the year, Hereditary (2018)struggles to balance realism and fantasy in an uneven film that will frighten only those who want to be frightened.This is two films in one: an unsettling and tense portrait of a family psychologically traumatised by deep grief, followed by a bizarre journey into supernatural fantasy. We enter the film at the funeral of a matriarchal grandmother attended by daughter Annie and her husband, Steve (Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne), and their teenagers Peter and Charlie (Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro). This is a family with a history of tragic deaths and Annie's eulogy reflects a twisted relationship with the deceased. As a professional miniaturist, she mentally lives inside a dolls' house world where she finds control over the chaos of her family life. While dealing with its recent bereavement, the family soon faces one more that is far more gruesome and bizarre. A cascading avalanche of weird happenings makes it increasingly impossible to separate what is real and what is psychotic hallucination.The first half of the film has all the ingredients of a firmly grounded and brilliant psycho-drama. Toni Collette gives an outstanding performance of a mother on the edge of sanity. Her emotive range is spectacular. In one scene she shares grief with another mother and the tears were flowing in my cinema, something that rarely happens in this genre. Excellent cinematography captures the transition from high-tension family grief to a place of ghostly atmospherics, but soon we find the inevitable reliance on standard horror tropes. There may be grounds, however tenuous, for the film to claim originality in creepiness but this is outweighed by an over-reliance on headless bodies, wispy floating forms, and other stock shlock.Whether this is your horror film of the year will depend on your taste for the fantastic supernatural. The attempt to explain a family's history of tragedy by invoking a ghostly masterplan will be unsatisfying for many. Yet some films in this genre can genuinely haunt you, like the deeply reflective A Ghost Story (2017)that inhabits the terrifying space between death and afterlife, or A Monster Calls (2017) that uses the supernatural to explore fear of death. Hereditarystarts with much potential but settles for the simpler goal of scaring you. These days, fans of this genre expect more.",Hereditary

But unlike Midsommar which I think had an understandable story, this movie seems a more confusing. Maybe it's intentional, maybe it's meant to mess with your brain, but it could also be interpreted as inconsistent.The good:
No cheap use of jump scares. More classy style of building slow suspenseWell planned shots and creative camera anglesGood acting, especially the mother character who is quite annoying but the actress is excellentThe bad:
The music is quite typical eerie music that says ""beware it's gonna get scary!"" I didn't like itThe rules of the story seem to change, or at least it felt like that. First it's almost like realistic, then it becomes more supernatural (still ok) but the ending it goes a bit too far out.I didn't find it so scary as people say. But if you think horror movies are scary when they make you feel uncofortable, then it might be your kind of scare. I thought it was more like sad and irritating.I just didn't really like it as a movie very much.

172,david-meldrum,"Promising, gripping and emotionally truthful - let down by an unsatisfying final act",7,1 April 2019,"Hereditary is a divisive film that wears its influences and touchstones on its bloody sleeve. An arresting opening sequence as the camera draws in on the family home at the centre of the story - or is it one of the mother's (Toni Collette) model/dolls houses? - sets the tone for a film which constantly sews seeds of doubt in to our minds as to what's real and what's imagined. It's certainly absorbing, and for much of the run time there's a pervasive sense of creeping dread, with the occasional well-executed jump-scare. Half an hour into the film, with our attention taken up with one on-screen crisis the director throws in an out of nowhere gasp-inducing moment; did that really happen? Yes, it did. I shouted out loud when I saw it, alone at home on my laptop at 11 a.m. on a Friday morning; I can only imagine its power in a packed cinema. From there the film starts to explore some familiar thematic territory: maternal guilt, survivors guilt, PTSD, trauma and grief. The film is certainly, largely, emotionally and psychologically truthful as the central family's carefully constructed existence threatens to spiral out of control. Key to this is a captivating central performance from Toni Collette, whose swings from doting mother to something rather more disturbing form the film's core; one dinner table scene in particular is a brilliant portrayal of a family in grief grappling, and failing, to hold themselves together. Notice should also go to Gabriel Byrne as the on-screen father/husband; an understated, quiet performance that is an essential foil for everything to spin off from. The sound and production design throughout is brilliant; the subtle lighting playing with our sense of what may or may not be real. It's in the last 30 minutes that we either commit to the film's ideas or not, allowing its influences of Don't Look Now and (especially) Rosemary's Baby to have their head. For me it doesn't quite work; it feels like one homage too many in a film that nods at much but never quite finds its own identity. The Babadook was a more effective, less talked about, recent horror film on similar themes; the ending of which was perfectly in tune with the story and themes that had gone before The risks taken in Hereditary's last half hour ask us to accept something that is signalled throughout the film but doesn't quite convince. If the ending lived up to what had gone before, this would be a special film indeed; instead it's one to be admired and enjoyed, a sign of good things to come from this director, but ultimately a little unsatisfying.",Hereditary

It is far more intelligent and more psychological than the majority of modern American horror films. Though a good handful of it's scary moments do feel very familiar and strongly reminiscent of most other horror sequences we've seen in the last 15 years (through films like The Conjuring and all of it's clones), the sequences all occur with great purpose. The film throws enough curveballs to really make it standout in the pack. The cast is phenomenal. This is the strongest performance I've ever seen by Toni Collette, by a longshot. She is so intense and so dynamic - it's really great. Alex Wolff also made a fan out of me, as the son - he had a really big role to fill and he killed it. Very brave. Gabriel Byrne was also a perfect choice for his ""voice of reason""-esque role, and of course casting Milly Shapiro was smart - she's apparently a big fan of horror movies in reality and that translates very well in the energy she puts out on the screen.The movie does move quite slowly through the middle but the way things wrap around make it necessary and worthwhile. Though it's slow, most every scene is still important - I would not have cut anything. Though the film did remind me a lot of most other contemporary horror films, it also had a lot of elements that reminded me of some of my favorite classic horror films of all time... I can't say which ones or that would be a bit of a spoiler in it self... but I will say that the main ones I think of came out in 1968, 1977, and 1980.Though it didn't completely blow my mind, Hereditary is one of the strongest American horror films of recent years. It features several images and sequences that you will most likely not be forgetting anytime soon. I am excited to see what first time feature director Ari Aster does next! A phenomenal first film!",Hereditary

178,ericrnolan,"""Hereditary"" (2018) is an expert horror film that I'm not sure you should see.",9,23 March 2019,"""Hereditary"" (2018) is a difficult movie to review. It's an exceptionally well made horror film, enough for me to rate it at least a 9 out of 10. But its content is so disturbing that I'm not sure that I can actually recommend it to others.From a technical standpoint, the movie is almost perfect. It's an astonishingly good first feature film for writer-director Ari Aster, it's gorgeously shot in the hills and deserts of Utah, and it's masterfully directed. The performances are uniformly perfect. If I were to name each actor who hands in a fantastic performance, I'd simply be reading its cast list. I can't remember the last time I watched a feature film in which every single major performance was exemplary. And ""Hereditary"" gets damned scary in its third act. (Seriously, give it time.)The only flaws that I can think of are extremely minor. The pacing isn't perfect. (The story occasionally seems to slow when events should be accelerating.) I had problems with the way that one key character was portrayed, and there was one plot point that gave me trouble. (I can't say more for fear of spoilers.) But these things are so forgivable that they hardly merit a mention here. You simply can't argue that this movie was expertly assembled.Yet I didn't always enjoy ""Hereditary."" I'd be lying by omission if I didn't state that. I shut it off more than once, and then came back to it when I felt more able to stomach the brutal events it depicted.""Hereditary"" is more than a ""dark"" movie; it's gut wrenching. Even if you have read its reviews and you've seen the movie's marketing, then you still aren't anticipating what will transpire on screen. (I'd even go so far as to say that the film's marketing was misleading, but I can't specify why here.) Yes, there's a obvious ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) vibe, and it's sometimes reminiscent of ""The Exorcist"" (1973), but the movie pushes well past the boundaries of those films, and it does so fairly early on. If I, a lifelong horror fan, was turned off by this, then I'm willing to bet that it would also be too much for a lot of casual film goers. (And indeed, while critics loved this film, audiences last year generally hated it.)I'm closing with a little bit of trivia. Toni Collette gives a tour-de-force performance here as the troubled mother. If she looks familiar to you, that might be because she's also the mom in another well known supernatural horror film - M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999).",Hereditary
179,Mike_Devine,Slow-burn horror that sticks with you,7,21 January 2019,"When 'Hereditary' first hit the film festival circuit, it garnered a reputation of being one of the most unnerving, scariest movies ever made. Since its official release, this reputation has held up.Written and directed by Ari Aster, 'Hereditary' is chilling on a number of levels, including how it was filmed. From the opening scene, it's clear that the techniques used in the film can make all the difference in how it translates to the audience. The use of slow pans, long stationary shots and silence throughout the film ratchet up the fear factor beyond what's expressly shown on screen. On the latter point, however, there are a few scenes that are so grotesque that you can't help but feel your jaw drop and sit in a state of shock. These scenes come out of left field and really stay with you long after the credits role, to the point where you feel the need to take a shower.But what makes 'Hereditary' what it is is the people profiled. Toni Collette's performance is deserving of an award, as her emotional range is tested throughout the film. Alex Wolff transforms from an annoying kid to a dead behind the eyes teen who captivates with his expressionless face. Milly Shapiro plays what is without question the most disturbed young girls to ever walk the earth. And Ann Dowd delivers a performance that can only be described as hauntingly matronly. The Graham family undergoes so much pain that it's hard to understand what could have warranted this. By the film's climax, however, things fall into place.If you're expecting 'Hereditary' to be your run-of-the-mill horror entry, think again. This isn't for the faint of heart.",Hereditary

183,eagandersongil,The scariest of the year,8,10 January 2019,"""Hereditary"" is able to use psychological terror very well, mixed the suspense and drama aligned with a great technique and script, made unusual for horror movies lately. Others who have such requirements are also ""Babadoock"" and ""The Witch"", although they like more of these two, ""hereditary"" has something more, it manages to appropriate the term ""terror"" with greater amplitude, he really scares, not with jupscare and increase of track, his terror does not go down the level, he prefers to use the tension with constant traumas that will shake the viewer psychologically, softening him, like a cook hitting a steak, for his final act , to blossom for once, to act as a watershed between criticism, to love and to hate, I love it, because it is tied well with the rest of the work and fleees a little from psychological terror to just terror, pure and simple, I buy your idea, buy your script and buy your tension. Technically, the star of the star Ari Aster is extremely competent, with a usual technique of classic horror films, with inverted cameras and constant medium planes, such as ""the tenant"" and ""halloween"" the film is extremely claustrophobic and supportive, its technique causes anguish and explain exactly the feelings that are expected in a horror film; disgust, tension and fear, with its coarse frames and its daring track, always in the right cut which helps in the fit of all these factors is the wonderful performance of Toni Collette, the actress is frighteningly well on the paper, indulging in psychosis and the could be a good Oscar nomination if the academy valued such a genre of feature films.

It is, however, one so harshly horrifying that it is difficult to recommend. Watch at your own risk. You have been warned.",Hereditary
185,Danny_G13,Almost perfect horror,9,24 January 2019,"Hereditary, like The Conjuring and Insidious, was 'boosted' by a hype train which alluded to it being the greatest and scariest horror ever etc - in the case of Conjuring and Insidious, these claims are miles off.And while Hereditary is not outright terrifying, it is by far the finest slice of horror to come out of Hollywood in an unspeakably long time, and comes much closer to truly getting under the skin of the viewer than any of its pale peers.If we start with the basics, and the story, we're introduced to a family of four, with what can only be described as a dark background permeating them, but while we get teased glimpses of what that might be, it doesn't start to unravel until something happens to change it all.And that change helps to develop the story from what many people expected into what it really is - a true horror about the hell of grief, the nightmare of loss, with more than a touch of darkness in there to show just how deep the root of evil can go.The performances in Hereditary are... they're mixed. Shapiro's Charlie is absolutely brilliant, while Colette's Annie was only overlooked for an Oscar because it's a horror. But Gabriel Byrne's Steve is forced into stupid moments and situations because the writers couldn't find a way to make his character work in this film properly. Quite frankly they made him annoying. But Wolff's Peter is another fine example of a strong performance, without it being stunning.The direction is superb, truly superb. It's a long movie but it doesn't feel it, and Ari Aster has done an outstanding job of showing what you need to see, while avoiding a lot of silly 'boo' scares. The ones he uses are excellent and work brilliantly. He and Pogorzelsi created a fine look and feel for the film, a sense of production which is fantastically made and some frequently excellent touches to make this film stand out.Sure, the story isn't really all that unique, in the grand scheme of things, but the way it's presented is, with originality, flair and panache plus that unbridled epidermal creaking horror lying under the surface.This is one very twisted film but without doing it overly gratuitously. What you don't see is more scary than what you do and Aster nails that.However, and a few have mentioned it, the ending - it's hideous, at best. It doesn't undo all the fine work which came before but it doesn't fit and it definitely detracts - I know where it should have ended and it really missed a trick.But this is nitpicking. It's the best horror to come out of Hollywood in decades and shows Asia doesn't have a monopoly any more on good quality terror.Excellent stuff.",Hereditary
186,W011y4m5,So close & yet so far...,7,6 April 2019,"Hereditary came so close to being a perfect movie - it's such a shame the film fell apart during the third & final act - classic example of how the ending can either make or break a story.
The first two thirds are truly faultless - a masterclass in effective editing especially - laden with genuinely career best performances from Toni Collette & Alex Wolff, both of whom were deserving of Oscar nominations for their portrayals of their characters - being magnetic on screen, stealing every one either by themselves or together.
Ari Aster managed to avoid making Hereditary like every other horror movie & instead found a unique, original way of telling his dark tale, creating uncomfortable, shocking & disturbing sequences which felt refreshingly new & inventive (shot equally as impressively by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski) - which is why I was so disgruntled when he inserted a clichéd horror movie conclusion to the rest of his phenomenal script - when it was deserving of such a better ending. What's more is he showcased his clear ability to be able to avoid falling into those traps with the first two acts so it's perplexing why he felt unable to while penning the third. If anything, it's just lazy...
Because of this, the film falls flat on its face at the final hurdle & that's what stops me from giving it a 10 / 10 rating.",Hereditary

189,x_manicure_x,Somebody is trying hard,7,14 August 2021,"""Hereditary"" is both an impressive debut feature and a wasted opportunity. This atmospheric, slow-burning tragedy centered on the impact of mourning, mental illness, sense of guilt, and decaying family relations proves Ari Aster to be a competent filmmaker, a great art director, but unfortunately not a convincing writer (yet).In the first half, we only get glimpses of horror and gore, with the supernatural elements being just hinted. The family drama takes a significant portion of the film, with a lot of unspoken but lingering narrative sequences, sophisticated shots, and unnerving music. In particular, I loved how the Graham's house is shot in a way that it almost makes it look like one of Annie's small world houses, even the furniture looks like small world toys. A lot of scenes just start with empty rooms, and every time I kept wondering if I was watching a diorama or the real house. This is a recurrent gimmick in the plot as well, as Aster seems to enjoy purposely putting you on the wrong track and surprise you with sudden twists and unpredictable events.However, once the forces behind the plot get clearly identified and explained, everything degenerates into a visually breathtaking and imaginative, yet trite and convoluted supernatural horror. If we take the plot as it is, so many things that supposedly have been triggered by coincidences and wrong decisions turn out to have happened a bit too conveniently, especially at the party. On the other hand, the interpretations that see the supernatural as a mere allegory fail at finding a convincing explanation for the ending.We are still talking about something far above the average of modern horror films, but it's a pity that the unique atmosphere, emotional depth, and impeccable aesthetics of the premise end up being wasted like that. The acting of the whole family was also pretty good. Toni Colette does indeed a great job at showing all the different sides of Annie Graham's character, even though there are times she gets maybe a bit too over the top. Milly Shapiro's character falls under most of the stereotypes of the creepy horror film kid, but she manages to deliver a natural performance. Alex Wolff felt a bit out of place and not as strong as the other actors, but I didn't bother. Gabriel Byrne is perfect as the father, but his appearance will be forever linked to the unintentionally hilarious scene in front of the fireplace.",Hereditary
190,evening1,The torture of a teenage boy -- this is entertainment?,5,16 December 2019,"I didn't think this was a very good movie, but I was deeply moved by the performance of Alex Wolff as Peter, a young lost soul in a family torn by mental illness.The movie draws you in in its first third, as we observe dour, washed-out mom Annie (Toni Collette) going through the motions of her life with Peter, odd daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and calm, see-no-evil husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne).Annie is deeply angry and bullies everyone in the family, fatefully forcing Peter to drag Charlie to a party one night. This demand makes no sense for anyone, but Peter goes along. Things go horribly, and Wolff is deeply affecting as a young person who tries to cope with trauma with absolutely no help from the adults in his life.The rage that flares between Annie and Peter over dinner one night is stunning. However, the movie goes severely down hill from there, as it descends into a cheap knock-off of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" with tacky references to ""Poltergeist.""What I'm left with in reviewing this film is the anguished cries of Peter as he wrestles with his mother's insanity and cruelty. As the mother of boys who are about Peter's age, I found the poignancy of Peter's situation to be wrenching. What a bravura performance!I've read that some other reviewers think Ms. Collette should have gotten an Oscar. She is indeed scary in this film, but to my mind, her antics are far from indelible.",Hereditary

194,jackmeat,Horror this good is few and far between,8,24 August 2018,"My quick rating - 7,7/10. Horror tends to not be this good. So when gems like this rise up, you need to quickly get your eyes trained on them. The elements that make this so good are interwoven through a story of a disturbing family secret that seems to be more than just an accident in the family. In a good horror flick, you need to have some mystery along with the scares to keep you interested in just why it is happening. Or just go all out with gore and show boobs. Well, as each style has their own place and audience, the more true viewer tends to like a good story along with the scares, and if their needs to be blood, then make it memorable without being gratuitous. The balance here is kept fully in check, and as each bit of info this family finds, or opens if you will, the more drawn in they (and you) become. The acting in this movie is really quite good, with each character dealing with the things around them in a very realistic way. One wants to dive head first into the spirit world, while others are terrified of it. And all are effected differently due to this. An excellent entry into any horror collection, and really is a two watch flick to pick up on everything, well, not really, just the end will make you want to go back and pick up some pieces that were stuck in there. A must see for true horror fans that want to just peel away from the torture porn for a bit (and you know I am a fan of that, but we all need some balance to our movie viewing).",Hereditary

Excellent use of light and shade and at just over 2 hours was an ideal run time.Also I have noticed some reviewers saying if you like this you're wrong and don't know what they are talking about...i would say the opposite is more the case...some people just cannot understand that a good script keeps you thinking and make up a few things yourself as you see it.

The debuting screenwriter-director Ari Aster has invested enough time and care to properly building things up, so it really feels like a unique place and time, populated with real people as opposed to pawns on the board to help move the story along.In the best King's novels traditions, the opening chapter takes it slow, letting the audience immerse themselves in the lives of the central characters. One could call it a family drama with supernatural elements few and far between, just for a taste.So far, so good - at least for those who really care about quality storytelling. But brace yourself and, above all, prepare to be patient.""Hereditary's"" trailers - not to mention the overall image of horror movies as dispensers of cheap quick scares - will probably work against the authors' best intentions. If you are waiting for some cheap quick thrills, you may turn impatient before the horror arrives in full force.It does happens but only in the middle of the long story, more or less, or after the first hour. This means that the less intelligent or committed part of the audience will be tired of waiting already - they will probably start checking the phones, laughing at random things, conversating loudly, etc.Considering that one can't choose or control the fellow people in cinema, I consider ""Hereditary"" much better viewing at home or for selected audience. Otherwise there's a real chance of mouth-breathers ruining at least some of the experience for the others.Anyway, the performances are committed and strong too, fully supporting the director's pursuit for building up the general atmosphere and suspense.Aster has used quite a lot of long close-up shots here, to accentuate the characters' suffering and inner turmoil which helps make the result feel one of its kind and special.Veteran thespians such as Collette and Byrne do their job very well as usual, but younger stars such as Wolff and Shapiro are deliciously watchable as well, commanding the screen whenever they are on it, like it was easy or something.Milly Shapiro, the creepy little star of the trailer, plays actually a supporting character - which is a shame, really. I can't imagine anybody getting enough of her outlandishness before she has to give the central place to other characters.So, the second hour starts, the horror arrives in full force... and that's it. All the qualities that make the first hour so strong and memorable (slow tempo, haunting style, character- and world-building) just vanish, making way to generic scare fest that you could easily get from any other cheap and fast horror movie.Switching gears is not bad in itself but disgarding all the deliciousness that has come before makes the second hour very humdrum, at least for yours truly.It's feels like a long unvaried ride in theme park's haunted house, without the original thoughtfully measured family drama adding some meat to the cinematic bones. The acting is still really good but it's not enough.Later I read from IMDb that the original cut of ""Hereditary"" could have easily pushed over three hours, mostly consisting of more family stuff (which would have added depth to the second part). That's probably why the second hour feels more flaky and less coherent.Ari Aster has done a series of shorts, but putting together a feature-length movie is much harder.Or maybe the producers didn't let him realise his original vision, forcing to add more and more ""scary stuff"", until it started having desensitizing effect, making one feel just kind of ""meh"".Having said that, many critics seem to really like the movie. Scores at Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes are sky-high. The users's scores are markedly lower but still higher than my 5/10. Go figure.",Hereditary

202,shobanchittuprolu,Hereditary almost promised an experience like The Witch but unfortunately it showed me The Witch again,7,23 June 2018,"Hereditary (2018):I strongly believe that only one horror film will be a Masterpiece per year and rest will disappoint. 2018 already got a masterpiece with A Quiet Place but surprisingly another film caught huge attention with its amazingly cut trailers. The most interesting aspect is that it came from the same production house which bought one of my most favorite horror The Witch. SO did it reach my expectations?Plot:A matriarch (Ann Dowd) in a household passes away and the family is stuck in what seems to be a permanent loop of grief. Annie (Toni Collette) tries her best to take control of the emotional index in the house but there is something not quite right with her daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) - as is the norm in horror, the child is seeing things the adults are not.My Review:Horror films have a habit of following a formula and recycling it until another film comes and charts a new course.The Witch started a course of a slow-burning horror which doesn't rely on cheap jump scares but still injects fear into each and every nerve of body. But unfortunately, no other film tried its style and Hereditary is the only one which came after a long time.Unlike most horror films where it feels like you are inside a horror-themed fun house of people in costumes jumping at you, there is an atmospheric creepiness built in Hereditary that makes you consistently uncomfortable. Hereditary starts with a tragedy and enters the main plot soon and moves slowly by injecting scenes into our mind with lot of detailing.The entire trauma faced by the family is shown too disturbingly. Even with less jump-scares, this movie still gives you goosebumps in right moments and especially the second tragedy is too hard-hitting.Aster's approach to scaring you has a refined and scholarly sheen - there is not a single moment of manipulative loud music just to induce shock value. But unfortunately he changed his track at the end which strongly resembled The Witch which totally disappointed me. The climax twist made me hate the entire film a bit.The final 10 minutes of the film is when Aster completely embraces the supernatural and it becomes a bit of a let down for two reasons - the revelation is not horrifying or unique enough for hardcore horror nerds, and if seen from the metaphorical lens, it comes across as an overtly explained and overlong spoon-fed information for audiences.Collette's performance is amazing but she is No Essie Davis of Babadook or Nicole Kidman of The Others..But Milly Shapiro is a revelation.Even when with less screen presence then other roles, she is the major scare point of the film and it is a praise. Alex Wolff is scary too.So,Hereditary almost promised an experience like The Witch but unfortunately it showed me The Witch again. It is vastly similar to that film.Note:- Indian Censor ruined experience with its brutal cuts...My Rating 6.5/10",Hereditary

Not really sure what all the fuss was about, but clearly not my genre. I've now seen supposedly the best two horror films of 2018 with A Quiet Place (dull) and now this (for me a much better film but still no great) - clearly not my genre of film. 6.5 out of ten",Hereditary
204,patriciogl10,"First and second act are excellent, then in the third a totally average disposable horror garbage appeared.",7,11 September 2018,"Hereditary, a film that could have been so much and ended up being just fairly good. Let's see, the first and second act are marevellous, taking the viewer through sheer excruciating pain and grief through the eyes of a very emotionally beaten-up family working their way through tragedy and how to deal with their lives after such scarring events. The acting is top-notch, Toni Collette and Alex Wolff absolutely steal the show, they deliver such powerful outstanding performances, definitely award-worthy.I was excited to see this movie, but the actual movie lies in the build-up towards the climax, and not including the climax itself, which it was so ordinary and reminiscent of typical horror nonsense you see nowadays; so utterly disappointing. A family drama with a horror undercurrent that keeps you enthralling with only subtle frightening suggestions; for such a great build up I was waiting for the ending to blow me away, and to my utter disappointment it didn't. It felt like I was watching a completely different movie, that is, a mediocre one. I just couldn't keep my eyes from rolling at such a cheap ending. However, I cannot be unfair with what came before and it definitely felt to me like one of the best horror films of this decade. I sincerely don't know how you are going to feel after watching this movie, like me perhaps, amazed and disillusioned at the same time; I get the feeling that a lot of people felt ripped off, not only by the ending like me considering everything it preceded, but also by the fact that is not a conventional horror movie with plenty of cheap scare jumps and nonsensical plots. Yet, is this unconventionality is what made it great in the first place in my opinion.I gotta hand it to the score, I can't remember such an infectious and unsettling piece of music belonging to a horror movie in recent years that was so attached to the plot, the characters and the overall atmosphere and 
tone of the film. Simply superb. Had me feeling uncomfortable during the entire movie.So there you have it, a film that could have been excellent, but instead decided to crush my high expectations that were built during the course of the film, which is what annoys me the most; the film itself raised the bar and lowered it destroying what was previously built so well. Still, a decent film; I urge you, don't miss out on this one! You may feel different than me.",Hereditary
205,noahgibbobaker,Great movie with poor elements.,7,31 October 2020,"I've been hearing amazing things about hereditary since it was realised. Because of this I purposefully avoided watching it until now as I knew my expectations would be too high. And they were. There are great things about hereditary and some really great moments, but I have a fair amount of issues with it that few people seem to acknowledge. Even with the problems I have I still think hereditary is a good movie and a fantastic directorial debut.My biggest problem is Alex Wolff' character as a whole. He just changes when the story needs him to, at one point he's a stereotypical rebellious teen and next he's calling his mum mama and acting like a young child If there is a reason for this please let me know. The dialogue written for Peter and the other teenagers is laughable, nobody talks the way Ari Aster thinks teens do. Alex Wolff' performance is also pretty bad, it's not helped by the awful dialogue but even if the writing was better it still wouldn't be good. Each time he tried to show any emotion it just ended up being unintentionally funny.Every performance except for Wolff' was actually great, even Milly Shapiro, the child. None of the other performances even compare to Toni Collette's though, her character and her performance were the best out of the bunch. Her dealing with grief was pretty convincing and sad. Oddly enough I thought her character and her dialogue was really well written, especially compared to Alex Wolff' dialogue and character. Having a poor performance and a great one in this film only made me appreciate Toni Collette's performance more.I have just a few more points to make that I don't want to talk about extensively. The CGI looked really bad, there are a few moments where different insects are shown, that's when the CG looks worst. The ending felt really goofy and I couldn't take it seriously. It is very well shot, use of slightly longer than average takes made for some tense moments. And the miniatures were so amazing and used really intelligently.Hereditary is a great movie with some really poor elements. It is clear that Ari Aster is a talented filmmaker only confirmed by midsommar, but he still has a lot to work on.",Hereditary

Terrifying was the cry from the media.
I have seen more scary episodes of Button Moon.It started off kind of creepy especially with Toni Collette and her model making which was very disconcerting. Both she and Gabriel Byrne are excellent actors and both give good performances.But the story is quite laughable and by the final 30 minutes had descended into the realms of Monty Python.
Once Toni Collette started flying it hit rock bottom.
The ending was hilarious as the son was taken over by King somebloodythingorother. By the time weird naked people and headless corpses started paying homage to the King any semblance of a horror film had been usurped by comedy gold.My advice is avoid like the plague as it is a pile of overhyped drivel masquerading as the new Exorcist.

208,elliotte2,"Feelers will love this movie, Thinkers will not.",5,30 November 2018,"Unfortuantely, I'm a thinker.Pros:
1. The acting is top-notch, especially for a thriller(not really horror for most of the movie). Toni Collette was untouchable and the girl actress impressed me as well. Everyone else held their own.
2. Camera work was excellent, instead of many edited scenes, the camera flows and stops and allows the scenery to be taken in.
3. Story keeps you guessing, what is real, what is not. So you are intrigued to see what happens next to validate your thinking.Cons:
1. The movie is very similar to VVitch or any Stanley Kubrick film(2001, Eyes Wide Shut), it builds slowly preparing you for a big climax and then you are completely confused as to what happened. I had to go to Wikipedia afterwards to figure what happened at the end. Not good.
2. It moves slow(just like VVitch).
3. Bad parent award. Do not want to say anything that may be a spoiler, but if your child has an affliction, condition, etc...you do things to protect against that. It would make more sense if parents were overprotective, not dismissive just to create a situation of drama in a movie.
4.Amityville Horror Award: When things happen, you should leave...period. When walking through a dark house, you turn on lights.I gave five stars because of the acting and the suspense build-up. Take away the acting and this is a 3 star movie for Thinkers. Feelers will get caught up in the camerawork and suspense and forgive everything else.",Hereditary
209,darkreignn,I've never been so stressed out while watching a movie before,9,10 June 2018,"I didn't grow up in a dysfunctional household, but after watching this movie it felt like I did; I wanted to call my therapist after this movie, and I don't even have a therapist. This movie was incredible. Part family drama about grief and loss, part supernatural horror film, ""Hereditary"" is a movie that I am most likely never going to forget, and after watching it you won't either. There are images shown in this movie that I've gotten nightmares about. The thematic elements are more disturbing than I thought I would ever see in a movie released in this day and age. The people sitting next to me in the movie must've thought that I was having a mini seizure because there were so many points where I was grabbing my head, clutching my chest, jumping in my seat, and going ""oh God no."" This movie isn't necessarily scary, but it had me so stressed out that there were many points where I thought about leaving the theatre to just calm down for a second. When the movie ended, the biggest sense of relief washed over me, not because the movie was over per se, but simply because I could finally relax. I won't give any explicit spoilers for this film, so don't worry. What I will say is that this movie is gorgeous. The direction, the cinematography, the lighting, every frame, every shot, everything is delicious to look at. The acting is also immaculate. Everyone in this movie acts to perfection and if Toni Collette doesn't get nominated for an Oscar then she will have been robbed. The top-notch acting and direction enhances this movie so much. While some people may be bored by the slow-burn feel of this movie, I was constantly riveted because of the acting and gorgeous visuals. That being said, this movie is divisive.My audience hated this film. The didn't take this movie seriously, and laughed at literally everything. One older woman said ""That was stupid!"" as soon as the movie ended and I felt personally offended, so offended that I said ""You're stupid!"" and then ran out of the theatre like a child. But you know what? I can see where they were coming from. You see, the ending of this movie, specifically the last 20 or so minutes, will be incredibly polarizing. But for me, I was already so invested by that point that the climax of the movie didn't bother me a bit.So what I'm trying to say is, give this movie a shot. You may love it, you may think it's one of the stupidest movies you'll ever see. But the story, the direction, and the acting are all so immersive that for me, this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.9/10",Hereditary

Even though the trailer didn't look amazing, it must have been because they kept all the gems for the actual movie.But no, again it's just another pile of overhyped Hollywood garbage. I think the fact that the trailer, and the main image you see when this movie is advertised, is of someone set on fire. Thats as scary as it gets, a guys gets set on fire...The acting is awful, just difficult to watch at times, the script didn't help, but it was just terrible.

212,rlaine,"Super intense horror, but still not quite the masterpiece I expected",7,23 January 2019,"I watch a lot of horror movies, especially like ones with psychological drama and religious undertones. I'm not into blood and gore, that's not horror imo. That's not to say this movie didn't have it's graphic and bloody moments.Well, there was a lot of talk about how good this movie is and to a certain extent I agree. It's super intense and well made, genuinely creepy and unsettling. But there was a lot that did not quite work. I'm all for movies that require thinking, but to me it feels like this movie expects viewer to make a bit too many conclusions based on clues and even if they seem logical after explaining, they really are not. There is also a lot of ""supernatural"" stuff, which is handy for script continuity and creepy factor, but doesn't help making ""logical"" conclusions easier. It's not exactly complicated movie, but to assume that pretty much everything we saw was pre-planned and happened for a reason is quite a lot to put together on a single seating.For example I very well noticed the symbol on the pole by the road, but why make one part of the ""summoning"" so super complicated and insanely random, other than just for the sake of making a shocking and unexpected scene.I like the fact that it wasn't just mental illness in the end this time, but I feel Annies (Toni Collette) character was somewhat off. Or maybe it was the fact that even tho Annie played like the lead, she didn't play a huge part when it comes to the story. Other than being the unwanted daughter. Peter (Alex Wolff) on the other hand wasn't as big a part of the story as he eventually ended up being. His looks were also very misleading as he didn't quite seem to fit the same ""hereditary"". Steve (Gabriel Byrne) was basically just a bystander and had no purpose other than being ""the sane one"". Charlie (Millie Shapiro) was an interesting character, but very much under used.Seemingly good, but quite unbalanced as a whole.",Hereditary

Which you find out at the end. Somehow she is the mother of this demon cult - but she is dead. So you wonder why this did not happen before she died. A granddaughter who was supposed to be the demon lord. But she has nut allergies - I guess demon hunters should use nuts. She somehow gets killed in an accident and now her spirit wants the body of her brother.A mother who has sired the demon lord (as the daughter) - but unwillingly. In this movie the grandmother had (you see in photos and models) breast fed the child - so I guess queen demon follower breast milk produces demons - another stupid idea. All these beheadings make no sense and are never explained. A mess of a movie - it is not a thriller, a chiller, just a money stealer.",Hereditary

Because the setting was good, as was the characters and the actors.But those themes do not work together with the supernatural, I think because you have to switch on different parts of your brain.

216,meathookcinema,"Vapid, noisy, hysterical and irritating. The James Corden of horror movies.",1,17 June 2018,"I was looking forward to this movie. Someone who had seen it in the States said that it was 'grim'. Another said that it 'stayed with you long after you've finished watching it'.Having watched the movie I can now say that it is grim. But not in a good way. It's the most pretensious, overly dramatic and ultimately vapid film I think I've ever seen.In fact it reminds me of when I was at university studying film analysis. There was a drama department within the arts faculty. You just knew that the small minority of quiet and introspective drama students would go far whilst you got the feeling that those who were loud, strutting and attention seeking weren't interested in acting at all but only in being centre stage. At the end of the year the drama students had to write and stage their own production which they would also act in.Hereditary felt like the kind of end of year production that one of the extroverted dramatists would have produced if it had then been picked up by a film production company and allowed to pollute cinema screens worldwide. Hysterics are ramped up to the max whilst tension and depth, y'know the things that good horror should hinge on are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only tension I experienced were by a couple near me who insisted on talking during the film. And they left halfway through. I was gutted and felt like running after them to try to persuade them to come back in. With Hereditary the film also seems to throw so many ideas into the pot that it really is a case of 'Let's throw all these ideas at the wall. Some are bound to stick!' It didn't work. In this age of remakes, sequels and reboots, especially within the horror genre, original and new ideas are paramount. It can still be done. Some critics and reviewers think this film might be the start of such a renaissance. It isn't and I pity them. I'm now going to watch Muriel's Wedding- a genuine masterpiece that doesn't squander Toni Collette's considerable acting chops. Hereditary is loud, hysterical, hyperactive and desperate for your attention. It's clearly the James Corden of horror films.",Hereditary
217,ivanmessimilos,Unusual but great horror,8,30 October 2020,"The last few years I've just given up on horror, so much garbage has been filmed that it didn't make sense to waste time on nonsense. A lot can be said about this film, the influence of classics like Psycho or Exorcist can be seen. At first the film confused me a bit, too much drama, it reminded me a bit of Sixth Sense (also starring Toni Collette). However, the more I think about it, the more I appreciate it. It certainly stands out in the sea of horror movies copy paste, there isn't a single scare scene that 90 percent of today's horrors rely on, and the movie is SCARY. Horror, a strange feeling in your stomach and anxiety accompany you throughout the film. I also have to commend director Aster, it sounds almost unbelievable this is the first feature film in his life. The film is visually beautiful, the camera is amazing, as are the different shooting angles and combining with the darkness. Also a lot of effort has been put into building the characters, on the level of one top drama, for sure someone will resent a film of this genre. Each character has their own story, reasons, and changes through relationships with other characters. The actors did a great job because they showed multiple layers of emotion, which is almost impossible to find in horror movies. Things and events that don't make sense at first and look weird, later make sense. A lot of effort has been put into so-called little things. Personally, the film is more disturbing to me than intimidating, if I may put it that way. The film definitely gains in value by watching it again, which is a plus, it is a very good and quality shot, primarily the film, and only then the horror. My objections are some unanswered questions and I have a problem with the rating of the film. It is completely different from movies of the same genre and it is unusual in that it may be about watching a habit, but not every habit is automatically a good habit. Also the film is so creepy to me that on the one hand I am sorry I watched it because I can't love it because of the experience and the feeling it gave me. I hope you who watched the film understood what I meant. However, I believe that fans of quality movies and horror have come into their own.",Hereditary
218,FelipeCarrillo,God Save Ari Aster!,9,5 September 2018,"It's all true. Ari Aster's psychologically brutal and unnerving directorial debut is a supernatural film feat conjured up by a convincing perspective that extracts from spiritism, demonology and necromancy a sufficiently disturbing mythology to perturb your mind with one of the best developed indie horror films of the new century, there are visual and storytelling magic. It's insufficient to say that it gets under your skin as soon as the credits roll, leaving a bad omen and unusual insecurity today in films that only will get away with a sinister tongue-clicking noise. The darkest perversity lurks behind familiar faces.Little known among the mainstream audiovisual world, Aster - New York, 1987 - began to carve out a niche for himself in the field with his meaningful and bizarre short films (""The Strange Thing About The Johnsons""), those that were enough inducements for production company A24 to grant its support to make possible his outstanding, scary debut into the world of celluloid. Credited as the single director and screenwriter - a strangely uncommon guarantee bearing in mind the unbelievable fruits, - this American filmmaker, an absolute new prey for the major studios, consolidates his idea and career with overwhelming solvency, exquisite certainty and necessary tranquility to freak us out; the control he has over the cinematographic tools he possesses is masterful, it's perceptible with every strange, purposeful scene in which the command of camera, script and actors become cardinal handholds to confer tremendous impact on a darkly penetrating family tragedy seen from the outside, but with a sharper review lies an inquisitive and traumatizing story of loss, forgiveness, sanity, family, union and, best of all, human and inhuman demons. The 2018 Sundance Film Festival was the first to build the wings to this psychological horror film to fly high, provoking an uncommon buzz for the genre since Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" premiered in the 2014 edition at midnight. Universal acclaim diffused by an effervescent mouth-to-mouth, critics' reviews or festival attendees' comments that crammed social media; honors geared directly toward the endeavor of two people in particular: Toni Collette and Ari Aster; but that would be a clearly shrink, incorrect avowal minimizing the set of visceral strengths constituting an incredible whole. Broadly speaking, the first big step corresponds to the excellent plot writing. As a good modern-day horror flick, the argumental lifeblood is found when you delve deeper its façade, the treasure about everybody are talking is in the metaphorical content, cloaked by obscurity and restlessness weaving the film. This entails a strong, intrinsic necromantic approach to the spiritual world, in fact, this is the main propeller of the plot; also, besides this fruitful, appealing core theme, a pessimistic and powerful family drama takes place, through which conscientiously walk mental health issues, mourning, pain, family chains, the importance of being part of a group and the responsibility it involves. But as a good modern-day horror flick, it must also work just as well if it's watched from the outside, and here all the elements are in the precise order to a nerve-racking experience for the most unwilling viewer, of course, patience arises as the main requirement. On that subject is where it works at its best. From the beginning, it sets up what kind of atmosphere the filmmaker will handle throughout the film, for example, as tension-builder master David Robert Mitchell did in ""It Follows."" The opening scene with a panning movement alongside Annie's working room, the lead role, urges to plunge into her miniature haunted house, a place where death really means death. This is a resource the film mostly respects, showing it with the importance the spectator requires, because unlike ""It Comes At Night"" by Trey Edward Shults from the same production house, The most hard-to-watch scenes don't end up being a kind of vision or nightmare sooner or later, the story takes them down as a significant and irreversible reality, is the fate of the game, a future marked by King Paymon; once you're selected, you cannot do anything. 
The film, as a whole, is a frightening and constantly shocking experience, however, being objective and selective, there are about five sequences simply rewarding, frame after frame with a pace and a surprise factor pathetically horrific that leaves you with your mouth wide open for more than an entire minute, you certainly don't understand why that just happened, but once you're sufficiently related to the characters and the mythology, this fantastic state of shock makes sense. In said sequences, the great affection and respect to the big, seldom-remembered horror classics through narrative executions are noticeable, however, ""Annabelle: Creation"" came to my mind at the time when we all literally lose our heads; Edward Shults' psychological horror thriller also got reminiscences obviously; ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" in its natural ability to disturb in no time at all or Robert Eggers' incredible unsettling debut with ""The VVitch: a New-England Folktale,"" and there are a lot of similarities in there. 
That ending, that ending is as mind-boggling and irrationally powerful as firs-timer Eggers's. An insane, schizophrenic third act prepares the ground for a monumental conclusion, one neatly written, astonishing and exciting splashing drops of horror situation after another. The tension is visceral and well-built, it makes you uncomfortable even when apparently nothing happens on screen; that ending is, without stock, one of the best in a real horror film since 2016. Drawing on grimoires to a tragedy plot is a tricky task and whoever wants to set a film on it should be sufficiently prepared and aware that it must deliver a coherent, cohesive and juicy story, faithful to the difficult supporting material and the hopes of the most loyal moviegoers. It bets on the anger and the search of one of the kings of hell: Paimon, who with 200 legions to govern, an ostentatious crown, a dromedary and an effeminate face, is considered one of the most obedient to Lucifer. If you thoroughly investigate who he is and his purposes, most of the complex narrative will get meaning, well, most of it, for sure; and although it seems that the magic of the film ends here, there is still some metaphorical study material to break down, in which it's necessary to decipher what's true and what's not. Is all this really about a mental illness legacy? family issues? is this just an enraged demon?It's not hyperbole: Toni Collette does deserve an Oscar; if you need proof, just buy a movie ticket, if you need proof, pay special attention to that magnanimous monologue in the grief support group or that ""usual"" family discussion at the table. Conquering with the most risky and sinister role of her career, ""Krampus"" actress delivers one of the best distressed-mother performances of all time, as well as a terrifying interpretation in relation to the nuances and demands of the character, there are dramatic peaks that the Oscar-nominated actress reaches with incredible ease, out-of-rational-control scenes in which this talented woman overflows pure talent. She's not a hackneyed crying-out-loud person, before all that, she's a morally-ambiguous mother possible only due to the traumatized, haunted behavior this brilliant Australian actress endows Annie; she directs most of the story to hand over control to a new and magnificent actor who's a revelation. Collette must remain the face of this unsettling film because this is rightly her moment, her tour-de-force has arrived.The same level of diffuseness and complexity put into the narrative, are in the creepy imagery. One of the best aspects of this bestial family nightmare is the powering, discomforting creativeness bathering every picture. Without hesitation, I ratify that even the minor element on screen has a narrative purpose that will mean a handhold for the next move/twist a few scenes later, and while much of that reinforcement is packed in the script, there are also several shots visually. In the very last minutes of the feature, we already are familiar with that beautifully spooky wooden house, we know the position of each room, where the loft, Annie's work area, the kitchen, the dining room and, of course, that scary tree house are, an amazing achievement possible by the excellent camera work. ""Don't Breathe"" by Fede Alvarez focused on elements that will be key pieces later, similarly this movie insinuates the importance on select utensils and visual tools that will make sense sometime later. Pay extreme attention to find the feats of the artistic field at the narrative level. Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography doesn't accept improvements; the way he alternates colors, shades, radical changes of atmosphere always influenced by an adjacent darkness. Colin Stetson creates dreamlike, nightmarish compositions, having the opportunity to empower the most bizarre scenes in which his meaningful melodies steal the spotlight; it's a warning of what is coming, zero tranquility and one hundred per cent tribulation, a score true to its source that paralyzes your senses.No doubt, ""Hereditary"" by Ari Aster is one of the films of the year due to first-class performances - even bandying about a would-be Academy Award or Golden Globe nomination, - a superb direction for a horror film and a slow-burning story of demons, dark secrets and legacies, a movie with a schizophrenic and psychologically effective pace that advances at full speed under the surface as a bone-crushing beast, willing to damage our dreams, and it has made it. Viscerally unpredictable, visually terrifying and well developed, Ari Aster is this year's Robert Eggers owing to one of the most beautifully unsettling films of the year and the decade.",Hereditary

The film stars Toni Colette who is absolutely astonishing in her role and possibly her best.

220,TheVictoriousV,"Terrifyingly strange; even better once you ""get"" the ending upon Viewing #2",8,21 January 2019,"The declaration that William Friedkin's Exorcist has ""finally"" met its bone-chilling match is a curiously frequent one (I believe people even said it of Veronica). It is always to be taken with a grain of salt, lest you end up disappointed by such new universal favorites as Hereditary. Possibly. Maybe not.I shall phrase it differently but similarly: this is one of the most smartly crafted, effective, well-acted and deeply unsettling horror films of recent times (I would even urge you to proceed through this review with caution, despite it being light on plot details, because it's just that original and unpredictable). One that moves you in ways far more lasting than a startling noise (especially if this noise is not produced in-universe and was added in post using loud violin sound effects) or some form of shouting ghost.But a horror film it is not. So insists Ari Aster, who says he was making a tragedy that becomes a horrible nightmare. True enough, it begins with a loss within the Graham family. The mother, a miniature designer named Annie (Toni Collette), is struck particularly hard. The son, Peter (Alex Wolff), has trouble focusing in school, not only due to his growing fascination with the female form. The daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro), begins behaving strangely and seeing unnatural things. The father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), just wants everyone to be alright, as fathers do.As time moves on, the family is met by an even greater disaster, and soon secrets from the past reveal themselves. Annie befriends Joan (Ann Dowd), who may know how to contact the other side, so she claims.The performers I've mentioned do a resplendent job (although Alex Wolff, brother of the also laughable Death Note kid, has some corny moments), creating a believably damaged family and layered humans, and the way it builds towards its unforseeably insane climax is astounding in the expertise it displays. But Aster has not directed a full-length film before this one. With this in mind, it is difficult not to love the film a bit more.Also immaculate is the cinematography, production design and editing. One early shot, that moves into the room of a house miniature and promptly becomes the set for one of the scenes, reminded me of the also nightmarish Inland Empire. There are implications to it, for certain and I look forward to the think-pieces. I should mention the terrific music by Colin Stetson.The film does adhere to some of the modern-day guidelines of horror filmmaking, unfortunately (I remember one jump-scare, albeit an appropriate and effective one), but its achievements are still considerable! I hereby give Hereditary an 8 and compel you to see it for (and by) yourself. For reasons I do not care to disclose, this is a movie I needed to see right now.In a time of remakes and soft reboots, every so often a terrifyingly strange gem appears and even gets to rise to prominence - something that especially hits the spot after you've seen rubbish like Jurassic World 2. Perhaps we're looking at another Oscar nominee, now that Get Out has normalized horror at the Oscars (although both films are indeed more than simply horror; sometimes comedic, even). I hope this film is nevertheless seen by many and that they do not read too much about it beforehand. Not even this.",Hereditary

In Hereditary, the risk was in making your audience truly disturbed. If anyone went into that movie expecting the classic suspense to jump scare combo, they left completely shook and distrusting of any future horror films. Hereditary kept me guessing between two possible outcomes the entire time. Truly horrifying.",Hereditary

Believe the hype but don't read too many reviews or any spoilers. It's different in the way that the story is told and how you feel that you are actually with this family. This is a movie that will leave you feeling disturbed and you can't even pin it on one particular scene. I am a huge James Wan horror movie fan! However, this movie is quite different in its tone, pace and atmosphere. This movie will have you thinking about it days after you see it.

224,brefane,One of the worst films that...,1,22 June 2018,"I ever sat through in a theater. Borrowing elements from The Witch, The Conjuring and Paranormal Activity to name just a few, Hereditary is excruciatingly slow, and obvious from the start. The film is largely limited to 2 settings: a modern rustic home where no one ever bothers to turn on a light, and a classroom complete with a teacher droning in the background and disinterested teenagers. There are no supporting characters, save for one, of any note or consequence. The acting is one-note and grating, and Gabriel Byrne's character is annoyingly and unbelievably feckless. What it all means is never explained, and the ending comes as a relief. Judy Collins singing Both Sides Now during the credits provokes snarky laughter; the feeling the whole film is just a big joke.",Hereditary
225,quaseprovisorio,ari aster is just a brilliant storyteller. and filmmaker. two films two wins. this one is a reflexion on grief and mourning done in a very insightful way.,9,17 May 2020,"I watched midsommar a whilbe back and i loved it. it's very different from this movie, more raw and contemplating, but also disturbing and most of all clever and very well shot. this is mostly a story about grievance and loss - while midsommar is more about a breakup. they both grab very common human feelings and put them into a movie pedestal - a bit what lynch did in eraserhead which was about his fears of becoming a father.i'm not sure but it's possible aster will go that way. both this and midsommar still are in a way ""closed"" movies, we can explain everything from front to back, even though we have problems on figuring it out firstly. i just watched this film and need already to make a lot of thoughts in my head in order for all to make sense. but what we have here is a family that needs to deal with grief, loss and the feelings of guilt. all of those put in an horror movie that metaphorically grabs them and conveys them into its universe.in a way the characters are feeling different things: one is feeling complete guilt, the other loss and desperation and i also think we have mourning and confusion. instead of putting this into a drama we have a very well crafted horror film beautiful shot (the camera movements aster does never cease to amaze me - the long shots where we can identify so many elements inside a scene, the shots from night to day, the panoramics around the head of the characters...) brilliant cinematography and music too. why a horror film: well we can argue that those feelings are scary. because they are. they make us powerless incompetent, inept, and most of all impotent. we're very fragile in those moments.this fragility seem to affect everyone in this family. i think what to movie wants us to understand is how the human being can't live without certain type of certainty - usually invented by his own brain. when collete's character doesn't have it...she explodes. everyone does. we can even argue that the ""horror part"" is kinda ust a gimmick to divert from what this movie is: a piece about human powerlessness. but it fits so well in the genre it's so well shot, told and acted that we can't do anything but applaud.i did enjoyed more midsommar than this - this one is more conventional i thought midsommar more brave styllistically speaking. but i can't do anything but applaud again. i don't know what aster does next but this kind of stuff can make him a classic director. let's wait and see.",Hereditary

The film starts well, with the cast crew perfect. The film's depiction of a serious dysfunctional family is good and scary enough. The action deals more about what is not said and done, than what we actually see. And here I think the movie works well the first hour. When the angle is then pulled into the occult, with scenes and sounds, it also works well in the beginning. But then I dropped off. The last part of the film turns out to be crazy for me, with effects that we are familiar with from horror movies, but I think the film takes a direction that I see was unable to cope with. I experienced that there were more people who went from the show and, even though I sat down, I did not get involved anymore. And I actually began to feel bored and disapointed. Unlike A Quiet Place who managed to keep the excitement and suspense all the way to the end, Hereditary becomes a movie that I think traces from a psychological and exciting start to an end where the crashing effects are in line and the solutions become too banal.",Hereditary
227,tfminfl,300. Hereditary. Super creepy!,10,11 January 2019,"300. Hereditary. I thought it was super creepy good. Follows a family that has some really bad luck, or is it something more sinister? Or it just could be a movie about the horrors of mental illness. So, Annie's mother just passed away, we get the impression that she wasn't all there towards the end, and as the family puts the affairs in order they start finding out more about grandma, and the stress of it all seems to awaken Annie's own struggles with mental illness. Annie's daughter Charlie is quite the odd child, besides cutting heads off dead pigeons and being very British looking, clucking her tongue absentmindedly, creepy, Charlie also struggling with the loss of her grandmother reveals part of their private convos, seems granny wanted her granddaughter to be a grandson, but why?? Movie definitey sets a creepy tone, and keeps you tense all the way through. In a weird way it reminded me of another super creepy movie, The Witch. Watch em both!

228,Bertaut,Rewards concentration,7,23 June 2018,"When her secretive mother dies, miniatures artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette), is almost relieved, as the two had a deeply fraught relationship. With two children, 16-year-old Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and a loving husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), Annie is determined to do a better job of raising a family than she felt her mother did. However, when she suffers another, far more devastating loss, Annie's mental state becomes increasingly precarious, as a series of terrifying revelations about her ancestry are slowly revealed.Hereditary is writer/director Ari Aster's debut feature. However, what's worth noting is that the film is produced by Lars Knudsen, who also produced The VVitch: A New-England Folktale (2015). This is significant insofar as Hereditary bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Eggers's film. Mood, tone, theme, pacing, narrative structure, shot composition; all recall The VVitch at times. Even the plot shares some important beats, most evident in the last shot, which is both narratively and compositionally identical to the shot in The VVitch when Black Phillip speaks for the first time - a BCU on a possessed character as a disciple speaks off camera. And like The VVitch, you either go with the plot and let it burrow under your skin, or you remain detached and most likely find the whole enterprise unintentionally hilarious.In a more generalised sense, there is quite a bit to praise here. For a start, to say the film is a horror is to basically give away the last 20 minutes, as up until that point it's a superbly realised semi-realist study of the crippling psychological disintegration that can accompany bereavement. Speaking of giving things away, very unusually for a Hollywood film, Hereditary's trailer brilliantly misdirects the audience, making it seem as if the film revolves around the death of Annie's mother, when in actual fact, this plot strand is abandoned at the end of the first act, after which the death of Charlie becomes the central focus.One thing the film does especially well is reward viewers who are paying attention. There are multiple hints and signs throughout of what is going to happen in the last act, and one especially well structured reward involves by far the creepiest moment in the film; the blond man standing in the shadows of the doorway, barely visible, smiling manically at Peter. This is actually the second time we see the character; he is also at the wake early in the movie, watching Charlie approaching the coffin, and, again, smiling unnaturally. This can be easily missed if you're not paying attention, and it's an extremely well realised pseudo-Easter egg. Also worthy of praise is Toni Collette, who gives a superb performance that partly recalls Shelley Duvall's hysterics in The Shining (1980). Collette's ability to communicate everything in her psyche by simply changing her facial expression is outstanding, and somewhat reminiscent of that extraordinary piece of wordless acting by Halle Berry in the last scene of Monster's Ball (2001). This is especially noticeably especially towards the end of the film, when Annie is alternating between being herself and being controlled by King Paimon; Collette's mastery of her own facial expression tells the audience everything it needs to know about what is happening.Joshua Rothkophf, in his review of the film for Time Out New York calls it ""a new generation's Exorcist."" That's a bit over the top; it won't have half the same kind of societal impact as William Friedkin's film did, and it's nowhere near as good as the best horror film of the last few decades, The Blair Witch Project (1999). However, it's very well made, is creepy as hell, dares to put real grief on screen, and features excellent performances (and, thankfully, only a couple of jump scares). Well worth seeing.",Hereditary
229,MrPupkin,The film successfully invokes true terror that lingers long after the projector flickers dark.,8,6 May 2020,"This messed up film was on my top 9 of 2018. It is a journey and it is only full of dread. There are moments that are too much and it's tough to watch. I get the divided audience review, much like The Witch. It is not straight forward horror and that is hard to gain an audience. Collette should have taken out best actress, her performance is amazing. Byrne is rock solid in support and it's great to see him in a role that deserves his presence. The film spirals to the finale and if you cannot board the train, it won't sit well for you. This is a film that audiences will find in the coming years and I feel the word of mouth will be kind. The critics loved it, but the audience was divided, which is a good thing. It will be reassessed by the audience, not the critics who have tricked the audience into thinking this is a straight forward horror film. The film has all the qualities of a horror classic to endure the test of time and I suspect this will be something of a long term cult classic. Great filmmaking and one film that will sit with you after the conclusion.",Hereditary

This film, however, brings light in the form of darkness, deep-seated knowledge of both film-making and grand design that pays off.I can imagine that this film is not for everyone. Just as I thought I understood its structure, it threw me off. It did the same a bit later, which I had expected. What I hadn't expected, was how brilliantly the film had been directed; so many facets come together with this film. The cinematography is beautiful and yet a little experimental. The story takes its twists and turns, just as a true horror film should, in my eyes; make no mistake, this is no humdrum Friday the 13th wannabe, but a modern film that reinvents the view of family.Humanity is somehow at the core of this film, and traditional values. As such, it's a quite American, if not western, creation. The film bears those hallmarks of Hollywood in mind.Toni Colette acts impeccably, as usual.",Hereditary

The title refers to how the family members die of unusual circumstances. Hereditary had interesting subplots and ideas that didn't add up. I don't know why it's said to be a horror classic. I didn't think it was that good. Visually well made, but the story doesn't make sense. I couldn't tell if parts of it were supposed to be scary. The ending when we find out what happens to the last remaining family member is irrelevant to the rest of the movie. The lady who had a seance to resurrect her grandson doesn't make sense when she is shown in photos of Leigh the main character's grandmother. Also, the bird that flew into the window and died shocked all the characters except Charlie. Why? Did she have special powers to do that? She also cut the bird's head off. Is that a premonition of her death? Besides, why would the mom recreate the death of her daughter as a miniature? Who wants to relive that?",Hereditary

However, it never really felt like a horror film for me until half the movie was already. I mean, they tried to give it a creepy atmosphere (like the bird flying into the window) but it honestly felt more like a family drama. Which isnt to say that stuff was bad, its just I was expecting a horror film and to you know, feel horrified. But once the horror does actually start ramping up, I thought it was quite effective. There was a lot of twist and turns. I could never predict where the movie was going to end. I thought Toni Collette was fantastic. One of the best performances this year. I thought Alex Wolff needed some improving. He was fine for the most part except for his crying scenes. I wish the film had ended without the extra bit of dialogue. At that point it was fairly obvious what was happening and it didnt need further explanation. Did the director not trust the audience to know what was happening?Overall, I have some mixed feelings on the film. At points it seemed like it wanted to go the more psychological horror route and other times it was straight up supernatural horror. It was very disorientating at times. Which works in its favour. And there's a lot of symbolism in the movie that I liked. It is going to be the kind of film that you'll want to discuss afterward. I think I just wish it didnt take so long for the movie to rwally pick up and start feeling a horror film. So for me, I think I'm going to give it a 7.",Hereditary

236,peeedeee-94281,Should have been named 'Gramarama' or 'Dullarama',1,23 June 2018,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie based on the great reviews it was getting. It was nothing like what people were saying. The first hour just drags on and on. It felt like the director didn't want to make a short movie, so he made sure the actors spoke their lines as slowly as possible. And the camera had to hang on every scene an extra minute longer than needed.
Sure there were lots of fancy camera editing tricks going on throughout this film, but it was just style over substance.
The ending was silly. It didn't make sense why they needed to go through all that elaborate setup just to get their final desired outcome.
And this movie was way too predictable, in terms of the themes, because you pretty much suspected it would go the same way as movies like Insidious, Paranormal Activity or Conjuring to explain the source of the ghostly manifestations, or the 'destiny' of certain characters.
The worst part was the way this family was portrayed. Everyone was a zombie. I didn't understand how Toni Collettes character was employed? Who makes or commissions diaramas for a living. And then she was making diaramas for every event in her life, including a TMI one for her daughter's birth lol. And what was the father's job? Gabriel Byrne just sits at a desk, answers the phone, looks at the computer. Not that we really needed to know his educational background, but a little background of his life, motivations, etc... would have helped. The kids walked around like zombies and after awhile, it just got tiresome watching them moping.
I would recommend skipping this one until you can watch it for streaming. Even then, don't pay full price.",Hereditary

It's all true.Hereditary builds slowly, patiently. It starts as a family drama circled by an aura of mystery about what has been passed down through their lineage. At first it seems to be movie about mental illness, then the movie is gradually revealed to be something else. And that something else is most horrifying movie in many, many years.The grandmother of a family has just died. Her adult daughter (Toni Collette), son-in-law and two grandchildren have varying reactions to her death. Grandma was a manipulative, mettlesome and disturbed woman, who had been largely estranged from the family. The only family member close to her was her granddaughter. After the grandmother's passing, strange occurrences take place. The grieving daughter's sleepwalking returns. The granddaughter has dark visions. So does the grandson. Then something tragic happens, and then everything escalates. The second half of the movie is pure nightmare fuel.I won't go into any further detail because the mystery and uncertainty of the plot is integral to the rising eerie vibe that engulfs this movie. The audience learns as the characters do, peeling back layers to uncover disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface. I can't say enough good things about the acting. Toni Collette deserves an Oscar nomination, Milly Shapiro hits a homerun in her film debut and Alex Wolff does laudable work as well.Director Ari Aster is a master at capturing emotion of the characters and enforcing those emotions on the audience. We don't just see their confusion and fear-we feel it. He brilliant constructs frames that leave something shadowy, possibly sinister, lurking in the corner. We think we see it but aren't certain. That uncertainty is unnerving. I imagine most of us will find ourselves checking the corners of our own homes for some time after witnessing this film. It imprints a haunting feeling that's tough to shake.Aster's willingness to let scenes linger allows his performers to reach the proper emotional levels. Collette and Shapiro are incredible at this. They emote so much with mere facial expressions. In many instances, their reactions are as chilling as the images themselves. This is a horror movie with very few jump scares. Instead, it builds skin-crawling discomfort through eerie music, creepy and ambiguous images, and devastating scares delivered at our most vulnerable moments. If you scare easily, do NOT watch this movie. It will haunt your dreams and waking hours for quite a while. If you like scary movies, this is an absolute must see. Just know that you're in for something disturbing. You've been warned.",Hereditary

Add intricate set design, precise cinematography, horrific imagery, a chillingly beautiful score, and explosively emotional performances (especially to Toni Collette), and you've got yourself a truly unforgettable film. Hereditary is not your typical horror film. It's not the one you watch with a bunch of your friends at a pizza party or one you take a bunch of sensitive girls to see.
It's a genuine horror movie. It's one that slams at your heart and your mind. It's a film that takes full concentration and attention to completely grasp, and if watched intentively, it's a genuinely scary movie; one that makes you feel vulnerable and shook to the core.

THat's the simplest way I can explain the plot without giving away spoilers.I've seen a lot of horror movies, and recently, following movies like A Quiet Place, Get Out, Don't Breath, It, and It follows among others, I've noticed that horror films have come back in a big way. All of the movies I've mentioned above were good films in their own right, showing that horror films are still as strong as ever, but none of those mentioned films disturbed me in the way that Hereditary did. From the very first scene in Hereditary you are uncomfortable, and that feeling only becomes worse as the movie progresses in a slow burn. THere is a creeping dread throughout the film's entire run, which only increases and explodes in some shocking scenes that you might think you're ready for, but you are not. THis film is still on my mind after seeing it days ago, and that is a sure sign of a classic horror film in the making.THe performances are all excellent, so they all stand out in their own ways. I can't say that any one was better than the other. THe actors gave it their awe, and you can't ask for more than that.Some people will wonder why I've given it a 9 instead of a 10, and the reason for that is this movie takes a turn towards the climax which might not fit in this day and age. I understand it, but in an age of electronics it might not work for most people unless they are willing to think back in times when technology didn't exist as it does now.

Exactly like Midsomer, I felt like this was a pointless film.A lot of this story felt clunky, unbelievable and unconvincing. The seeming instigator of the events was the daughter's death which I found comical due the series of coincidental events that led up to it and the ludicrous manner in which she died. Why did the mother insist she go to the party for older teenagers? Unlikely. Why did the girl accept? Unlikely. Luckily for the film she has a nut allergy and eats some cake at the party which sets her off and continues the chain of events that leads to her head popping off - the brother rushing her to hospital and of course veering off the road due to a dead animal in his path and then getting the angles just right so that his sisters head is removed by a post. I actually sniggered when it happened.Then there's just clunky bits like from out of nowhere we discover the mother is into witchcraft when she goes into an attic and starts going through witchcraft books - whose were they anyway and how come the exact relevant points to the film were already highlighted in the books?SO not one for me really. Very over-rated. Other than a bit of atmosphere and the odd creepy moment it's really a pretty rubbish film.",Hereditary

There are three things that I expect in a solid horror movie- reasonable gore, good storyline, and originality. For that last one, this movie definitely meets the mark- it's certainly original. But for the other two, it fails miserably. Now if you're a huge gore fan, you probably won't mind. But if you're like me- you don't mind some gore, but you hate it when gore is so extreme that it overtakes the movie, you probably want to pass on this one. Finally, the storyline- it sucked. It was super convoluted, tried way too hard to be deep, and seemed so intent on being original and avoiding common tropes that it just became boring.

This was easily the best horror films of 2018 and one of the best I have seen in years.I won't go onto details about the plot as I don't want to ruin anything, but to say this movie played with your emotions would be an understatement. Not only did the film have me on the edge of my seat, but it constantly had me wondering where the film was going.I was all around impressed with the directing. For a first-time director Ari Aster did an outstanding job. He really channeled from classics like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist to make this modern masterpiece.On top of the directing the movie made amazing use of sound to not only scare, but to unnerve. The sound in the movie perfectly built tension that helped carry the film during some of its slower moments.It's rare for a horror movie to have acting as a selling point, but Hereditary delivers. I'm a fan of Toni Collette, but this may be her best role. She really portrayed the wide range of emotions someone going through grief experiences. Outside of the horror elements the acting alone made this film a credible family drama about loss.Of course just like so many great classic horror films this movie psychologically manipulates the viewer. The movie has a slow burn methodical plot progression that builds suspense and creates a feeling of dread. At times the movie is purposely slow, but of course this is just to build up for what will come. When the extreme elements of horror finally happen you are absolutely floored. There were scenes that made me cringe and will stay with me for some time. The gore and violence though all served a purpose, there were no cheap scares.The movie really plays with your expectations for a modern horror. This is not a jump cut horror film, no this is meticulously crafted suspense driven film that pushes the boundaries on modern horror. That's what I love about this movie. It is one of a handful of films that seeks to rebuild the horror genre into the suspense driven atmospheric journey that pushes the viewer to the edge of sanity. This is what happens when directors who love the genre get a chance to make a horror film. A 9 out of 10.",Hereditary

It is a spiral of mystery and pathos. Even the decapitation scene is both deplorably disturbing and artistically beautiful. Then the film can't decide whether it is a Rosemary's Baby, The Ninth Gate or a Wicker Man ripoff; so it just becomes an overly-muddled mess. Once Toni Collette meets the woman the filmmakers clearly cast because they couldn't get Character Actress Margo Martindale, everything goes by a very laughable book. Literally. Plot points might as well be telegraphed with giant neon arrows. All the subtle ambiguity and mystique from the brilliant first act and a half are laid bare and shoved in our face. Again, literally. The odd grinning man at the wake seemed sinister then. But his reappearance later in the movie (sans his funereal attire) elicits chuckles rather than the shock which was the obvious design for every one of the plot's four or five desperate climaxes. Each one a bit more unintentionally goofier than the previous. While the overall premise is fantastic, the bizarre shift in tone and misdirected execution of the second half just didn't work as well as, or with, the first 45 minutes. The huge diorama metaphor from early on is forgotten, only to be shoehorned back in at the last second for the final scene - which is more silly than it is disquieting, unnerving or scary. It was good until it wasn't.",Hereditary

I've long been a fan of Toni Collette, I think for a long while she was most underrated and it's only lately people are becoming to realise what a fine actress she is. 
However she excels herself in this film and it shows what can be achieved with a good story, a great actress and an excellent director.

252,msghall,Beautifully-filmed horror with a musical score that pulsates with intensity,8,13 June 2018,"Beautifully filmed and realized, credit should be given to the musical score for staying out the way when needed and bringing the thrills at the most opportune times. Today's accompanying music is usually too loud, not particularly matching what is going on the screen and just plain bad. This is the exception. The score almost makes the movie. That's not to say the rest is not almost equally as fine. The pace may be slow but percolates with tension. The director is adept at showing us just what we need to see and hinting at more to come. It's not all perfect, however: the son, who is supposed to be a young teen but looks closer to 40, elicited embarrassed laughter from the theatre audience on at least two of the most intense scenes when his crying is so fake you have to snicker. Likewise, Toni Collette does a wonderful job here but her accelerating hysteria begins to take away some of the power of her performance. The ending is somewhat anticlimactic and doesn't match the intensity of the rest of the movie. But that's griping. This is a horror movie that avoids most clichés while giving us thrills, chills and plenty to talk about afterwards.",Hereditary

The films that do normally tend to scare me more are those that make me jump and those that have a supernatural theme. This had both and did not disappoint. The first hour is a bit slow but the tension really builds and the final half hour I was watching with a hand placed over my eyes. The cast are excellent from the two young kids to the grown ups. The boy Peter in particular was outstanding and Toni Collette gave an amazing and quite horrifying and realistic performance also. The background music and score was also quite unsettling and added to the tension of the film. I wanted a scary movie on a Saturday night and it gave me that and so was not disappointed at all.

256,ccorral419,Devilish secrets take to long here,6,16 June 2018,"""Shorts"" director Ari Aster steps up to the big boys chair, with this somewhat suspenseful thriller about a family plagued with death at every turn, ultimately revealing devilish secrets. Favorite Toni Collette (""United States of Tara"") and staple Gabriel Byrne (""The Unsual Suspects"") are parents to creepy little Milly Shapiro (watch out for this new raising performer) and conflicted young Alex Wolff (""In Treatment""). When grandma passes, and an accident occurs, a visit to grief counseling brings a mysterious friend Joannie (terrific character actress Ann Dowd ""The Handmaid's Tale"") into the family. Aster wears the hat of Writer here, and unfortunately gets in his own way with prolonged sequences between suspense, a haunting score that leads to little, and continued exterior shots of the house location that are supposed to invoke suspense but get old. Kudos, however, to him for the opening ""miniature set"" scene that starts the film, an effect not seen before on the big screen. Across the board, the leads do their best to deal with suspense and uncertainty. However, due to the weak writing, Collette's character is left begging for acceptance, Byrne has little to do, and while the camera loves Shapiro's presence and Wolff's uncertainty, the overall experience is too drawn out and falls flat at the end. Suspense films are at a low this time of year, which can only be the reason ""Hereditary"" is getting so much attention.",Hereditary

Good use of metaphors and foreshadowing to hint at the eventual outcome, which all comes together to help make sense at the end. Though, very clever on how it was filmed in order to keep the viewer guessing throughout.I only ranked this a 7 instead of an 8 because of the ending.

259,WubsTheFadger,Hereditary,9,16 June 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerIt should be noted that this film is incredibly disturbing. I am not a person that is easily scared and I am usually not impressed with horror films. This film thoroughly impressed me with the amount of quality scared and the eerie atmosphere.The story starts off very fast and builds the tense very well. All the characters are believable and relatable in a way. The story creates a very mysterious tone but keeps a very scary feeling throughout. The plot gets extremely disturbing very quickly and keeps the disturbing imagery flowing smoothly and gracefully. The use of silence makes your stomach turn as you anticipate a scare, sometimes the scare come but other times it leaves you waiting. The acting is extraordinary. Toni Collette delivers a stunning and frightening performance. She is truly an amazing actress. Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro also give amazing performances. Gabriel Byrne performs very well and is my favorite character in this film.The pacing is perfect. The first half hour of the film was scare free but the remaining runtime left me tense and scared.This is one of the most effective horror films to date. The ending left he disturbed and I had chills running down my spine as the credits rolled. I left the theatre frightened and had that feeling of maybe I shouldn't have watched that. Spoiler BelowI thought the father's death was a little weak and that the plot twist that Joan was friends with the grandmother was telegraphed. Either way, the film stilled held onto its power of disturbing the mind.Spoiler OverPros: Disturbing and dark story, great use of silence, music, and the building of tension, perfect pacing, very disturbing imagery, amazing acting, Toni Collette's stunning performance, and an ending that will leave you scared and hopelessCons: Read the Spoiler section if you want to know the consOverall Rating: 9.1P.S. This is one of the best films of 2018. I would not recommend this film to people who are easily scared. This film only had about two jump scares but this film will leave your disturbed and wishing you hadn't watched it. If you want a less scary witch's tale, I would recommend The Witch: A New England Folk Tale",Hereditary

261,adrian-43767,"Fine direction, good acting and yet...",6,5 July 2018,"Ari Aster, who debuts as director, has done a very fine job of keeping the spectator riveted without using conventional music or scary sound effects. In fact, the scariest moment in the movie comes from young daughter's swallowing in her saliva. Toward the end, one hears what appears to be a yoga mantra, and never has any mantra sounded more terrifying.The claustrophobic atmosphere is appropriate and well exploited but the moment Joanie comes in with her supernatural contacts, the film begins to go over the top. There is far too much gore in a film that actually tries to be subtle most of the time. And Peter's coronation as Paimon in the end struck me as a damp squib, after all the shenanigans and cruel killings.Finally, Gabriel Byrne is simply wasted as Steve, a husband who apparently just misses the plot altogether and has no authority at all within the family. What about sleepwalker Collette and all her miniature furniture and people? Couldn't see the point of it. Admittedly, this is not my type of movie, but I cannot honestly give it more than 6/10",Hereditary

We both sat there and began checking our watches...30 minutes, then 50 minutes then 90 minutes and then I whispered to him: I'm sure the horrifying part is coming soon. The movie moved at a glacial (pre-global warming) pace to the point we were considering jumping ship. We were rejoicing over the fact that we used MoviePass. The major action during all this time was a glass moving on a table. My buddy asked: what is the husband's occupation? I whispered: I hope he's a family/mental health worker.

265,spencergrande6,A genuine nightmare,8,30 April 2018,"This is a bit of an old fashioned horror movie. Something that plays as a dramatic movie first and then slowly becomes something else. Like ""Rosemary"" or ""Exorcist"" but without the high profile clout of those directors. This is two hours of an exploration of family tragedy and grief through characters struggling to cope.To say much of this film is to ruin it, so lashing praise onto certain aspects of it is the best one can do. Not to say this is a film with a big twist, it isn't. Toni Collette is fantastic as is no surprise at this point in her career. All the performances carry their own, including one I was unsure of at first but grew on me throughout -- Alex Wolff. The cinematography, rhythms and pacing, sense of place and space, and sound design are all superb and work in conjunction to create atmosphere and dread -- like a pit in your stomach that continues to grow and grow throughout.It turns into a genuine nightmare that absolutely worked for me.

267,PotassiumMan,Surprisingly torpid and frustrating horror film that drops the ball,6,2 July 2018,"Although quite gripping in some places, this film generally left me bewildered at what so many critics were talking about when they praised it to the high heavens. Not because it's terrible but because it's an awfully ordinary film in a lot of ways. Lack of pacing and uneven performances are flaws that critics usually don't forgive.It's a story centered around a family coping with grief and recent loss. Giving away more details would just be unfair. I went in knowing as little as possible and that's what you should do too- IF you plan on taking the time to go see this.Performances here a mixed bag. Toni Collette vacillates between being the film's driving force and at other times being one of its biggest liabilities. In some of the film's intended moments of high tension, her histrionics can border on B-movie acting, which is very strange because back in the day, she gave a powerful supporting performance in ""The Sixth Sense"". Gabriel Byrne gives a dutifully stolid performance as the father in the family and his stoicism is more a counterweight to Colette's reactive performance. Milly Shapiro is an intriguing talent as the daughter, but this film gives us just a taste of her acting chops and nothing more. Alex Wolff is a talented actor who is well-utilized in this film as the teenage son.The film's biggest problem is its long stretches that lack any energy at all. Some moments in the film linger on and on, sometimes to a dulling effect. A film that is noticeably lifeless for any considerable period is not going to easily make up for such a flaw especially if it doesn't finish strong. I found the second half to be more annoying than scary. In the end, this is a near-miss because I do sense a potential master craft in the hands of director Ari Aster. He just might need a really good editor, going forward. Not recommending this film, as it was mostly disappointing.",Hereditary

The Omen or Brood for example.It explores themes around grief and death, consequences of actions in life and living with regret. In this regard, in places, it reminded me of another film released around that time, The Babadook.In both films we see a mother struggling to deal with the loss of a loved one however in Hereditary this loss is compounded by further tragedy. The resulting deterioration in mental health leaves us questioning how much we see is real and how much is supernatural.However, in Hereditary we find ourselves being increasingly and helplessly drawn in to a bizarre metaphysical cult and the results is a disturbing trip to a dark and unsettling place.Brilliantly photographed with a soundtrack that's reminiscent of the horror greats, this is a movie that is derivative yet combines each element in an original and engaging plot of increasing dread.",Hereditary

276,bastille-852-731547,Very Well-Acted but Slightly Erratic Horror Film,7,9 June 2018,"With its outstanding reviews, strong buzz, and creepily powerful marketing, ""Hereditary"" has come to theaters with far more buzz than the typical independent horror film. This can be chalked up at least in part to the outstanding track record and marketing efforts of indie distributor A24, whose other films tend to be of great quality. While not quite as great as last year's horror film ""It Comes At Night"" from them, this is a solid film that has much to commend on its own merits.It would practically be a crime to spoil this movie for the uninitiated, but all I will say is that the film tells the grim tale of a family struggling with the death of the matriarch (Toni Colette)'s mother. Things start to spiral out of control from there, in ways both expected and unexpected. Right from the first frames, talented first-time director Ari Aster grabs you with an intense and almost oppressive sense of psychological dread and never lets go until the finale. The ability to create such a feeling of dread and doom in a realistic--rather than cheesy or ludicrous--manner is truly commendable. The film's simple music and score is its greatest instrument (no pun intended) in creating such a visceral personal feeling of deep unease. Unfortunately, such score also feels quite repetitive at times which occasionally can dilute its prospective impact late in the film--but it still generally works well. In particular, attempts to create emotional power with the score during the film's more dramatic moments could have been improved. The film's performances are very strong throughout, with a particular emphasis on Toni Colette. Colette nails the role of Annie, an artistic and grieving mother of two, with skillful precision. From her facial expressions to her visceral processing of grief, her performance feels wholly authentic and impactful. The film does feel consistently intense and scary throughout, and credit must be given to Aster for not emphasizing the ultimate tired and lazy horror cliché--the jump scene. (There is only one real jump scene, but it is properly timed to be truly unexpected and quite well-done.)Despite is positive qualities, ""Hereditary"" does have some flaws as well. The film's pacing can be a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, I truly appreciate Aster's intention to frame the film within the context of a slow-burn, tense family drama to promote the establishment of thoughtful character development and associated thinking. On the other hand, this pacing means that the horror elements often feel a bit rushed near the end. In particular, the film's last ten minutes feel like they are paced outrageously fast--which may, to some degree, reduce the psychological impact of such scenes. Also, while the film contains many original elements, its frantic finale also deploys some rather common and predictable motifs in the horror genre without creating a spin on such elements to differentiate them from other common representations within horror movies. That said, this is a well-made film that fans of the genre will likely appreciate--although it remains to be seen whether mainstream audiences will, as the film may be too slow for much of its runtime for many of them. 7/10",Hereditary

In that, Clytemnestra kills her returning husband, Agamemnon, in revenge for his ritual killing of their daughter, Iphigenia, which kicked off the voyage of the Greeks to rescue Helen, at the start of Trojan War.The addition of the witchcraft angle was unnecessary. It ruined the bones of a good movie, and it was telegraphed far too early and they filmmakers showed far too much. A mother, rotten to the core, who ruined her daughter's life and that of her kids, doesn't need the witchcraft to be scary.Toni Collette was wonderful, as was Alex Wolff, but their performances were stuck in a noisome film. There were no scares, there was no nuance, in this film; the theatre I saw it in was silent through the entire running time, and no one was scared.

282,quinnox-1,It's only horrifying to consider going to pay to see this! Warning.,3,9 June 2018,"""Hereditary"" is total garbage. Don't be like me, and fall for the misleading advertising surrounding this turkey. This movie is not really horror, by the way, but much more of a ""black comedy"". Many of the scenes are done in such a way as to make you laugh on purpose. But the comedy is pretty bad, even allowing for the low standards of this genre. I won't even go into the lame story - suffice it to say that its the usual setup for a horror film centered around a cursed or satanic-like family line. The story is superfluous to the movie, really, only serving as a way to setup cheap jump scares. Very cheap. I was also not impressed by the actors performances. The mother of the troubled kids in the movie seemed to be trying way too hard, and was overacting like crazy. The weird little girl was one dimensional as can be, and was obviously chosen because of the unfortunate way she looks, (like an elderly person in a child's body) The son character acted like he was 5 years old, even though he is supposed to be a high schooler. It was also very odd that he appeared to be swarthy or of Hispanic or middle eastern descent, when both mom and dad in the film were both very obviously white people. But I guess that is Hollywood these days, diversity trumps logic or even common sense!3 stars -- only for some good cinematography of the outdoors in certain scenes.

Of course, no movie ever needs to be made, but Hereditary is a movie that really did not need to be made, more so than other movies that have been made. It is a partial mix of Rosemary's Baby with maybe Mother! or other movies that were made but did not need to be made.It is unclear what Hereditary is about. The genre-fit it claims is drama, horror, and mystery. However, one could also imagine it as a failed black comedy, because the audience who watched with me laughed loudly at either all the wrong times or all the right times. It is a fine line to entertain with intent or by happenstance, because the outcomes are the same. The problem with Hereditary is that it does not move any needle in any perceivable direction, and it is hardly dramatic, horrifying, or mysterious.It could be an artist's interpretation of a family who regularly takes too much Ambien or NyQuil. If that is the case, Hereditary might be the most important movie ever made, in addition to being a subtle suggestion that it is never too early to consider emancipation from your parents, and it is never too early to spray the attic for insects and other pests.",Hereditary

That this destined tragedy occurs right when the Graham family is trying to give themselves a second chance just makes it all the more agonizing. Having grown up in a similarly unstable and dysfunctional home to the one established here, Hereditary almost played like a worst case scenario of my teenage fears living in a house of bottled guilt and toxic narcissism on all parts. I saw much of my own family in the Grahams', myself included, and while nothing can quite capture the fears and feelings of unease having to grow in that kind of environment, I'll be damned if Ari Aster's wide-shot, utterly misanthropic fever dream doesn't come close to catching that lightning in a bottle.Hereditary's editing is maybe the only example this decade that could give Uncut Gems a run for its money. The zoom in transitions from Annie's dollhouses into the only slightly less artificial mortal world, the dream-like cross dissolves ominously preceding new emotional lows for these tormented characters, even the extended shots (a trend I'm usually annoyed by) are always used with a true sense of purpose and intent on capturing what these characters are feeling.The direction is so impressive that I'd argye newcomer Ari Aster essentially boosted the prestige of the entire A24 Horror brand by it. The singularly unique use of soft pastels, the wide range of lighting techniques to convey mood, this is a positively gorgeous film. As it turns out, it sounds just as impressive as it looks, the raging, thundering musical cues almost taking on a personality and character all their own, screaming aggression and demonic influence.Toni Collette heaped great tons of praise for her performance as Annie Graham and rightly so. She manages to create a matriarch both insidiously narcissistic and heart-wrenchingly sympathetic, even disturbingly relatable. That being said, Alex Wolff's performance as Peter Graham was woefully underrated. The fact people have the gall to call his raw, gritty, deeply unsightly crying ""funny"" really frustrates me. Frankly, he didn't get hate because his crying was unconvincing. He got hate because his performance was realistic and passionate on a downright uncomfortable level.While we're on the subject of undeserved criticism, I don't find anything ""funny"" about the last 15 minutes either. If anything, the ghastly, hideously violent proceedings of the ending were the only way to end a film this operatic and grand in scale. This is a story of gods and demons more than it is one of human beings, and those entities want to show Peter all their terrible wonders before they finally take what they want. The way a possessed Annie looks at Peter, amused and entertained at his horror, suggests a sadistic playfulness that's positively blood-curdling.Hereditary is everything that A24 Horror should aspire to be, the gold standard by which I measure all of their genre features. Terrifying, emotional and filled with beating pathos, it's a film that has more than earned its treasured place in the hearts of millennial Horror fans.",Hereditary
289,cbnewham,What a waste of a good build-up,4,21 June 2018,"I went into this without having read any reviews - only the major headlines from critics saying how wonderful it was. I'm was in agreement for the first 1 hour and 50 minutes. Sadly the remainder of the film was dire.I loved the build up and suspense. It was well-acted and the dark foreboding with very few jump scares was a refreshing change from the usual standard.Then we get towards the end and the film descends into the usual standard of horror films. The revelation at the end didn't make any sense in the context of how Paul, the boy, was treated in the lead-up. It seemed as though the script writers, having done an excellent job of building up tension, suddenly realised they didn't have an ending and so cobbled one together so as to get their pay-cheque.Perhaps they should have cut the film at the flower-bed scene and saved us the big ""explanation"" at the end?All in all a big disappointment.So out of 10 stars which I would have given it: 4 off for the awful ending and 2 off for the retrospective nonsensical treatment of the characters once you know what the ending is.",Hereditary

My boyfriend called a few of the big twists before they happened, but I'm assuming most people were surprised. Once the credits rolled I immediately decided that I never wanted to see this movie again, in a good way. It was just SO disturbing!! It gets under your skins and doesn't let you go even after the ending scene. I was confused so I googled some explanations and it cleared a lot up, but I recommend going into this one blind.

It was superb acting from her.... but Gabriel's role in the film was very weak. Why didn't he stand by his wife? In fact, I think he was miscast, as was her son. His acting was wimpish and amateurish. Nepotism from the director??? Now, Milly. I can't see why people rave on about her. Totally crap acting and unfortunately, she is not acting material. I don't think that she should have been cast in the film at, all... in any film actually! The best bit was when her head was chopped off because that was, in essence, the last time we would be seeing her. Whenever we/I saw her, I thought, OMG, why has she been given a role in this film?

Good acting, very strong main characters
Pretty creepy, points to the soundtrack and the special effects/writing
Heavy emotional beats, pacing plays off wellCons:
Ending, while visually spectacular, is a little explanation heavy, subtlety could've been more fun
Pretty illogical that there were no attempts to seek out a mental health professional, probably because there was no time limit on the conflictBest part: the few minutes after Charlie dies, so heavy and so realistic and a great plot point
Worst part: seance with grandson Louis, kind of weird that the cult could do that even, whatever",Hereditary

296,jburtonprod-802-759029,An Almost 'No Burn' Horror Movie,7,16 June 2018,"This is a strange movie. It beyond 'slow burn'. It is almost 'no burn'. You're not even really sure it's a horror movie or a psychological study or a paranormal psych study until the move is almost entirely over. It's not a very effective big screen movie because it is so inwardly focused. That being said, 'Hereditary' is an oddly effective horror movie. It gets under your skin. It reminded me, in tone, of 'Burnt Offerings' or 'Let's Scare Jessica to Death'. I have a feeling this movie will really be appreciated on the small screen where the performances and the inner struggles of the characters will be magnified. It's a strange viewing experience because you can really miss large parts of the movie and you'd still get what was going on at the end. The performances are all great and by the time the movie is over you feel like you've gone through something... you're just not sure what it was. I think the movie is a little overrated at this point. A 7.9 rating puts it near the scale of a movie like 'The Shining' and 'Hereditary' is nowhere close to that but for what it is it's a very well done, intelligent and creepy horror movie that will leave you thinking. Thinking somewhat disturbed thoughts.",Hereditary

Any recent grievances actually would be a bad thing to take into the film. It deals with them in a very unsettling, emotionally turbulent way. The film itself is a masterfully directed horror. If you're bored of Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle, Ouija style flashy jump-scare movies and prefer your horror more subtle and considered (e.g. The Babadook, The VVitch, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, arguably Killing of a Sacred Deer) then you'll relish Hereditary.What I love most about Hereditary is its firm footing in emotional family dynamics. The strained relationships form a solid backbone for the more eerie elements, and are often just as unsettling to watch and think about. In some ways I wish it had pushed this side more, as I like it when cinema has something interesting to say about humanity. As a horror though its very effective, and a terrific addition to those lists of ""what's your favourite horror?"" that do the rounds regularly.",Hereditary

They portray the trailers for all of their movies as these truly unnerving horrifying masterpieces and they are scams full of mediocre build up and no payoff. It's happened with the witch, it comes at night, and many other critically acclaimed borefests. Critics once again must be getting paid off to hail these as new age horror classics. I snuck into this film because I wasn't going to be robbed of my money like I was with the witch and it comes at night. A24 should be reported to the BBB for their fraudulent scams that are their film productions because the trailers and marketing constantly tell the consumers these are horror's.

301,thomvic,A family on the brink of destruction trapped in a horrorific inevitable nightmare,8,26 June 2018,"I was very nervous to see this movie as I had read all the reviews prior to my viewing of this. Many claimed it to be as scary as The Exorcist and that this film had very disturbing images that would stay with me. I can say that it got half of it right.This isn't a typical horror film that relies on jump scares that you know are coming. The horror really comes from the tragedy of a family that breaks down due to circumstances that occur in their lives. Yet this is what makes it feel real as it could happen to any of us. The feeling of loss, the blame that occurs in tragic events and the process of grieving is all captured. I won't say much about the plot other than Annie (Toni Collette) and her family recently have lost the grandmother of the family. Annie mentions at her funeral that she was a private woman and that there were some conflicts in the family and the relationships were strained. Annie eventually starts to discover more about her grandmother's life which leads to more discoveries than she probably wanted.The performances in the film are terrific overall. Toni Collette portrays all sorts of emotions from anger, devastation, horror and sadness flawlessly. She is her finest in this film and the dinner scene just shows her acting abilities. Really hope she gets an Oscar nomination for this role.The film slowly builds up a sense of dread and despair that doesn't let go at all and it makes you feel uncomfortable. The first hour of the film can feel like it goes quite slow and this may put off some viewers however it really makes you get emotionally invested in the characters. Thus seeing their pain later on makes it that bit more devastating.The ending was a little bit disappointing, maybe not because I saw it coming, maybe because it gives you the answers in a spoon fed way. A bit more subtlety might have worked better.",Hereditary

307,Endless_01,Dramatic terror with a special touch.,7,5 June 2019,"A family begins to suffer from strange events inside its home after the death of the family's matrarch, which ends up provoking terrifying phenomena within the family.Hereditary is a special horror movie, very different with a distinctive combination of forces, which combines the emotion of pain of loss with the terror of the unknown and unexpected, showing us truly raw and disturbing images. The advancement of the film keeps up with our expectations, however, through the middle of the film, a totally devastating event (which most of us probably don't expect) occurs, provoking a complete turnaround of the argument and creating a terrible and depressive atmosphere full of dark and pagan touches.A supernatural story taken to the big screen with a distinctive direction and characterization, the characters each bring a gram to the strange narrative of the story, showing us a rather unique and sad perspective for a movie of this kind. A good horror movie with excellent touches no doubt, even so I think it could be shortened a bit, suffering from a bit of overexposure and dramatization, however, I think that's the reason for the film, to be long to penetrate well into our skins, although even so, the duration of two hours was a bit frustrating, but despite that, it was a special experience.",Hereditary

311,cappiethadog,Extraordinary people,8,22 May 2019,"Calvin Jarrett(Donald Sutherland) finally takes a side, his surviving son's side, and stops making excuses for Beth(Mary Tyler Moore). Conrad(Timothy Hutton) was right; he, too, can see it now. Beth Jarrett is not an ordinary person. When did his wife become unknowable? Donald Sutherland, whose previous role was that of a San Francisco health inspector in Phillip Kaufman's 1979 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", famously shrieks and points at a woman, a human, in the film's final scene. Nancy(Veronica Cartwright) finds out too late that Dr. Matthew Bennell turned into a pod person. This time, the woman gets to be the pod. And although ""Ordinary People"", Robert Redford's 1980 debut film, is not a genre picture, an element of horror, the human sort, makes Beth's demeanor all the more bloodcurdling, because here, the dramaturgy at work is the human condition, a precept of allegory. Calvin, who loves Conrad and his deceased son Buck in equal proportion, sees the vacancy in her eyes when her surviving child stoops down to give his seated mother an unreciprocated hug in the living room. Sutherland doesn't point and scream like a banshee, but the father's silence is a judgement, the same as the health inspector: You are not one of us. In the Kaufman film, a half-awake Dr. Bennell fights a losing fight against sleep, which as a result, turns him into a plant-based replica. Calvin, conversely, is half-asleep, always willing to give Beth the benefit of the doubt, explaining to his son's therapist(Judd Hirsch) that she loves Conrad, but has a hard time expressing it. Now, however, both eyes are wide open, an eyewitness, he is, to Beth's shortcomings; a blank face, a telling projection of her maternal disconnect to an atoning son's show of affection. She doesn't love Conrad. Later that night, Beth packs her suitcase. The marriage is over. ""I don't know who you are anymore,"" he says. Neither does Beth. Calvin was right when he tells Dr. Berger that the best of his wife was buried with Buck. Reminiscent of Bryan Forbes' ""The Stepford Wives"", the Christmas shopping sequence shows Beth, in her element, a mall, saying ""hello"" from an escalator to a friend on another escalator going the opposite direction, seemingly happy. In the next scene, we realize that she's going through the motions. In a high-end clothing shop, Beth stares at, or rather, stares through a mannequin outfitted in a sparkly red dress. ""May I show this in your size?"" the saleslady asks the perfect homemaker, who slinks away in embarrassment, laughing at the woman's inquiry, as if trying on a slinky red thing was the most ridiculous thing she ever heard of. There is nobody left to get dressed up for. That mannequin, so lifeless, so much like a corpse, and headless, Beth recognizes as her old self, the life of any party, who escaped from the cemetery. Sure, she still gathers by the piano with other high society ladies, singing alongside them at exclusive soirees, laughs on cue at unfunny jokes told by stodgy captains of industry, and always knows the right thing to say in public before her class-conscious friends, but it's not her. Nobody can tell that she's a robot on the fritz. Nobody can tell that somebody attached her head to a new body.Annie Graham(Toni Collette), wife and mother, a seemingly ordinary person, just like Beth Jarrett, loves her two children disproportionately. It's hereditary, the Robert Redford film and this debut feature by Ari Aster, but the Grahams are not ordinary people, in spite of Annie's best efforts to shield her loved ones from the Leigh family history of mental health issues. Starting with her mother, Ellen, whose funeral, in the aftermath, inspires Annie to remark ""should I be sadder?"" back home with her stalwart husband Steve(Gabriel Byrne), and ending with herself, who once tried to set her son on fire. Sleepwalking, the mother was, but ever since the miniaturist artist doused kerosene on Peter(Alex Wolff), coming perilously close to setting him ablaze with the strike of a match, he presumed, correctly, as it turns out, that his younger sister Charlie(Milly Shapiro) was Annie's favorite. In ""Ordinary People"", the husband accuses Beth of needing life to be ""neat and tidy"". Similarly, Annie's miniatures, based on her real life as a wife and mother, recreations of familiar interiors and familiars, are static, like establishing shots frozen in amber. ""Small World"", Annie's upcoming show, is emblematic of ""neat and tidy"", ""mess""-free domestic dioramas; a projection of what Calvin accuses his wife of wanting; no family crises. Beth was a private person; she didn't want people knowing her business. And Annie, likewise, reveals nothing in her art that she doesn't want the world to see. For example, hours after her Ellen Leigh's funeral, she tells Charlie: ""Grandma wouldn't let me feed you because she wanted to feed you,"" while tucking her in for the night. Translated into miniature art, Annie uses her creative license to change history. While her mother stands bedside looking feeble and adrift with her breast lay bare, Annie is in charge, feeding Charlie. But all artists are liars. If the figurines possessed fluidity, the observer would see two partially-exposed women fighting over nursing rights. The manifestation of Ellen's ghost in the spare room, Annie can sense, relates to Charlie, which is why she faces the the bedroom scene away from her. The mother knows that Ellen is coming after her granddaughter, but how?Annie is Heracles, the Greek figure who thinks he has control over his own destiny, ignoring all the signs that propose otherwise. Peter's English teacher defends Heracles, which has the effect of absolving Annie from being arrogant, because ""Sophocles wrote the oracle so that it was unconditional."" There are signs. She sees her mother's ghost; she knows that the door to Ellen's bedroom should be closed, but still denies the presiding matriarch's presence over the family. A second class is in session, concurrently; Charlie's class, the one with Satan as an unaccounted-for pupil. At her desk, Peter's sister works on a doll, the more pressing concern, than the teacher's quiz, because life as she knows is almost over. And so it begins, fate's first move against the ""pawns in a hopeless machine"". A blackbird's progress ends in a crash against the classroom window. It's fatal flight draws Charlie's classmate to the smeared glass, except for Charlie, who eyes the scissors on her teacher's desk, instead. The blackbird loses its head. Charlie loses her head. Ellen's young protege knew that she'd be decapitated, but not how, when, or where. Grandma was a practicing Satanist. What looks like a series of convolutions that leads to Charlie's beheading: Annie's insistence that Peter should bring his sister to a house party; the presence of walnuts in the chocolate cake that flares up Charlie's allergies; the swelled neck that restricts her breathing which leads to a rolled-down window and protruding head, was, in actuality, preordained, because the occult language is inscribed on the telephone pole's surface. The accident was foretold. That's the devil. In ""Ordinary People"", the row boating tragedy was forewarned. Conrad admits to Dr. Berger that they should have known better; there were gathering storm clouds brewing. That's God.Conrad Jarrett should have been the drowning victim, not survivor. To her credit, Beth never comes out and says that. There is no direct expression of a mother's choice. Annie, on the other hand, admits as much in her nightmare, a two-fold dream told with visuals then words, in which we learn how her art, so seemingly objective is not so objective, after all; it just obfuscates her subjective point-of-view. Annie's dream starts like this: She awakens to black ants on her bedsheets; ants that form a trail to her son's room. The mother, we already know, can't forgive Peter, because she said so in a family dinner that went off the rails. The mother looks agonizingly over the ants covering the whole of her son's face, knowing that this was Charlie's roadside condition, a makeshift ant colony. Annie recreates a miniature of her daughter's death. This nightmare is the subtext of that installation. Whereas Beth shouts: ""Buck wouldn't be in a hospital!"" as a way of intuiting her preference that Conrad had been the body in the casket, Peter's mother is more on-point. Annie's dream folds into another dream: She wakes up from sleepwalking; she tells her son: ""I never wanted to be your mother."" Peter would have been an abortion if not for Ellen's intervention. But both mother and son misunderstood the night of the attempted murder. Peter was sleeping in the wrong bed. Charlie, in accordance with church dogma, was slated for death. In ""Ordinary People"", Beth treated Buck like a God, but it's Conrad who possessed a sort-of god-like strength to have held onto the boat. Deep within her subconscious, because evil is ""Hereditary"", Annie knew that Peter was a vessel for Paimon, one of the eight kings of hell. That's why the match remained unlit.""Hereditary"", arguably, is ""Ordinary People"" retold as a horror film. The Grahams are extraordinary people. Instead of personal demons, the family has actual demons in them; the devil inside. Both mothers don't like messes. Beth was a housewife; her counterpart, an artist. Annie, like Beth in that small boutique, can't go through the motions any longer. Conrad's mother needed her husband to snap her out of it. Annie, a modern woman, does it herself. ""I am not sleepwalking anymore,"" she yells at Steve over the phone, and smashes her latest installation, a recreation of Ellen's funeral, to pieces. She can't pretend any longer that it was an unhappy event. She tells the truth, finally. Annie's art was a corrective measure to her life. She makes a mess. Now her art is true-to-life.",Hereditary
312,emryse,I Couldn't get to Sleep after Watching This,7,19 September 2021,"This was a good film, I watched it with my family who weren't very keen but I think that it felt quite different to what is usually offered in todays horror films and delivered an interesting if slightly messy plot fairly well.The first 2 acts aren't really scary, foreboding, yes, scary no. They do however set up well for the 3rd act leaving breadcrumbs that come together to reveal the greater elements that have been at play behind the scenes throughout the whole film. While the breadcrumbs have been lay out however this doesn't stop the final act feeling like a fever dream which appealed to me but less so to the people I was watching with. The performances are all good, especially Toni Collette who I love more and more every film I see her in. The cinematography was good but didn't really stand out to me but I did appreciate the editing with there being some great match cuts.I think that Hereditary is a required taste, personally I think it's far scarier than the CGI mess that films like IT can evolve into but I understand that a lot of people disagree and just want to see jump scares every 5 minutes. I'm going to recommend this film but just remember that it's a slow paced film, give it time.P.s.

It is one of the best horror films of the last decade, it is a set of an exquisite script that does not overdo the resources, a mysterious and picturesque photography, and excellent interpretations. Although the final scene I did not understand so much, I feel that it could also have been a fault of mine as a spectator and in the hypothetical case that it was really a mistake anyway it generates a lot of fear and suspense, it achieves the goal.Ari Aster confirms to me that he is one of the best directors that have emerged from the genre and that he has put it at a level beyond what we are used to seeing. It does not fall into clichés even if it touches topics that have been trite, the resources it takes makes it a horror movie with personality and that is the most attractive for me.Toni Collette deserves absolutely everything, I really do not understand the injustice of not being a minimum among the nominees for the Oscars that season. Only by making a magnifying glass on the flexibility of her gestures on her face does she allow her to transmit all the emotional charge that her character has and more, it goes beyond what I have seen in any performance of the genre and in general.

That this movie is listed under the horror category is a moot point, The film is an examination of family dynamics, from an intensely personal perspective. That the film evolves into the horror format at the conclusion does not rob it of its power. There are hints abounding, unsettling touches throughout. The use of color in the Palette, The music and sound design. And all the while the events spiral deeper into depression.
What truly rises this movie above the standard franchises, is the brilliant acting, and the razor sharp dialogue, The unparalleled intensity present, even in the relaxed moments. The top performance here belongs to Toni Collette, playing the Mother, Annie Graham; A talented Artist and mother Her art form is Scale Models. Interiors richly detailed. They take up most of her upstairs studio workshop.. She is under pressure about an upcoming show.
Her husband is a warm and caring father named Steve, played by Gabriel Byrne. Aside from being a rational voice, I was never sure of his profession. Their oldest child Peter, played by Alex Wolff, has his normal time at his high school, the only time, one senses that he is comfortable, particularly when smoking weed with his friends. The events at the home however, leave him shell shocked. I found it very tough to watch this young man become undone. Then there is the youngest child, and a pivotal role, acted stoically by Milly Shapiro, playing a nine year old. Annie's daughter Charlie. She displays artistic talent, like her Mother, she is also a very quiet and introverted child. Seemingly living in a world of her own. Shapiro handles the complex role and plays with understanding beyond her years.
From the start, the significance of the Mothers models as analogous to the real world is apparent. It seems like a Wes Anderson touch; The opening credit camera pans through the house in miniature. it is a tour of the Graham household. The pan ends up in the bedroom where the figures are real. Befitting the somber nature of the movie, the story begins with a funeral. Annie's mother has just died. Everyone is grieving save Annie, who confesses she had no love for her Mother. Throughout the movie Annies honesty is up front. She is given to long and revealing monologues, that delve deep into the characters persona with a passion reached only in the likes of a Bergman movie.
The script is brilliant and the words ring true, they sting, but resonate. Toni Collette is riveting and due an award for her performance. I should also like to mention a side role, Ann Dowd, as Joan, a lady Annie meets at a bereavement group. Ann Dowd endows her character with such warmth that one could easily relate to her, her benign reaction to a séance, is played like someone who has just been saved. Her offer that Annie try it at home, however has sinister undertones, Such is the craft of this film, It is a nightmare after all, complete with disquieting images and unsettling events.
Yes, there are the elements of the supernatural, A book or incantations that her dead mother left hidden in a box of belongings, A makeshift séance, Annie is prone to sleepwalking and suffers Dali like visions of ants and corpses. The films conclusion comes, but without much respite; Just an explanatory visual replacing verbal exposition. It does not quite match the emotional levels the movie previously attained. There is one moment in the film that absolutely devastated me. You will know the one. This does not happen to me often in a movie. It is a credit to the Director and his skill. The editing is exceptional, by all means watch Hereditary at your own emotional risk.Nine out of Ten intense stars.",Hereditary

Overall, I thought Hereditary was a brilliant 2-hour scare. If anyone is looking for a decent horror film, then look no further. The performance from Toni Collette as Annie Graham is phenomenal and it baffles me as to how she didn't get an Oscar nomination for her performance, it was really that good. You can't beat an original story and the fact it is writer and director Ari Aster's first feature film makes me love this film even more. Apart from the few predictable parts this is a brilliant watch and I will certainly be revisiting if I am in the mood for a good horror.Quote - ""I don't like this, Dad, I don't like this"" - PeterRating - 4/5 - 8/10",Hereditary

352,ccamp89,Showcases what horror is capable of when taken seriously,9,9 June 2018,"In many ways, Hereditary is the horror movie I've been restlessly waiting to see for so many years. Despite my avid fandom for the genre, I really feel that modern horror has lost its grasp on how to make a film that's truly unsettling in the way the great classic horror films are. A modern wide-release horror film is often nothing more than a conveyor belt of jump scares strung together with a derivative story which exists purely as a vehicle to deliver those jump scares. They're more carnival rides than they are films, and audiences have been conditioned to view and judge them through that lens. The modern horror fan goes to their local theater and parts with their money on the expectation that their selected horror film will ""deliver the goods"", so to speak: startle them a sufficient number of times (scaling appropriately with the film's runtime, of course) and give them the money shots (blood, gore, graphic murders, well-lit and up-close views of the applicable CGI monster etc.) If a horror movie fails to deliver those goods, it's scoffed at and falls into the ""worst film I've ever seen"" category. I put that in quotes because a disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across the theater as the credits for this film rolled. He really wanted us to know his thoughts.Like similarly fantastic and crowd-displeasing horror films of the past few years, The Witch and It Comes At Night, Hereditary is a film that largely deals in atmosphere and emotional horror. The Shining, which happens to be my favorite horror film, is a clear touchstone and I would go as far as saying that this is the first modern horror film I've seen that genuinely captures a similar tone and ethos. Much like that film, it delivers its horror through an intensifying sense of unease and dread that becomes nearly suffocating by its conclusion. Rather than startling you with cheap scares, it offers haunting and upsetting images which are often delivered without any of those overused sonic jolts. Perhaps most importantly, it anchors everything in an emotional core with nuanced characters who experience relatable family struggles and grief. And that is absolutely critical to what makes the movie effective and resonant: it works on a metaphorical level, using the supernatural story as a vehicle to explore the very real way in which a family can be absolutely ravaged by tragedy, and furthermore how trauma and mental illness are passed through the generations. I'd be remiss not to mention that Toni Collette gives a mesmerizing performance in this film that is absolutely unhinged and truly difficult to stomach at times.For all that praise and as excellent as I think it is, Hereditary isn't quite a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I was very much invested and riveted throughout the length of the film, there were some detectable pacing issues. I feel conflicted in saying that because I'm very much a fan of the slow-burn horror style which benefits from a deliberate pace, but I did get the occasional nagging sense that things could've been tightened up just a tad without losing the effect. Some of the scares in the film, often the more ""traditional"" horror moments, also struck slightly the wrong note with me on a first viewing and were just a hair too campy or on-the-nose given how visionary and restrained the majority of the film is. And in its ending few minutes, the film really shows its full hand when a bit more ambiguity may have served it better.The positives far, far outweigh the negatives here though and Hereditary is ultimately a remarkable debut horror film which showcases what the genre is capable of when it's taken seriously by a talented director. Here's hoping we'll continue to see more like it.Light 4.5/5",Hereditary

354,mvike,7.3!? AS A HORROR!?!?,5,21 October 2019,"If this were a drama, or something other than horror...it would've been way better. I'm sorry but this might be the most overhyped film in years. It's got all the typical horror tropes: teen hates parent for some ridiculous or non existent reason, ""I'm not crazy"" person that no one believes, and a few others...I just couldn't get into the film...nothing about it scared me at all. And it's demonogy facts were absurd, especially saying the demon was male demon...which has absolutely no basis in reality...
(as far as what is taught about this specific one in the context of it existing that is) the only scene that I felt uneasy with was, the car scene ...everyone knows exactly what I mean...brilliantly done. Also, the mother was a brilliant actress. And I'll give a little credit for a bizarre ending, but as I said...it just isn't there for a horror film...I'll say this...if you thought ""The Witch"" was HORROR...you'll likely find this to be horror. If you found that scary...you may find this to be creepy.Is it a bad film? No, it's just not really horror...even the #1 review here says ""would've been better as a drama""",Hereditary
355,thespeos,How Depressed Do You Want to Feel?,5,2 May 2021,"Ari Aster wrote & directed this film, as well as Midsomar. Both films are dark, perverse, and engulfed me in despair.His work is of very good quality, but his penchant for evil (OK, horror) veers towards a sick mind. I think he's sick.The film has solid technical qualities:>> Excellent story
>> Constant tension
>> Great acting
>> Characters that actually come to lifeBut if you're a parent, have any empathy, or don't like when evil rules the screen - make an appointment to see a therapist before watching this film.A few scenes overly stretch credulity ... trust me, you'll see. But, overall it's movement is taught, believable, and quite tricky. Again, Aster makes quality film.

357,vmalast,Disappointed,3,29 August 2018,"The photography, setting and atmosphere were great. The acting was indifferent. Honestly didn't care if anything happened to them. The potential was definitely there to be a fantastic film but, it felt short in many ways. We all know that with the horror genre you need to suspend belief, not to expect characters to act rationally or appropriately in given situations. As another reviewer pointed out, in a few situations the characters acted and scenes presented in an incredibly unbelievable way. You make you teenage son take your young daughter (who has a serious food allergy) to a high school party without knowing the parents, friends or location. You send them both off without an Epi Pen. 'Nough said on that scenario. After the accident, no police or school involvement, no therapist. After all the suspension of beliefs, I found it difficult to enjoy the film.

363,suvechhabose,Close to Lynch standards,7,23 February 2021,"All right , here's the thing .
Now m pretty certain i don't hate A24 cinemas like i used to because of The lighthouse , uncut gems & now Hereditary . These three were good cinemas while the witch and midsommar were pretty bad. The witch was directed by the same person who made the lighthouse & now i see why Ari aster pulled his punches in midsommar.About the cinema,Yes.The first half was pretty boring except the car accident scene , even that was full of fault cause a normal brother would absolutely look back to see his sister's decapitated body and nobody can go back to their normal school life without dealing with the law . Nobody can .
Ari aster completely removes that part.
I don't know why ~But the cinema just touches holy ground of movie making after its 50% . From lighting to cinematography , from background score to sudden shots of running were filmed brilliantly.
Now many people have wrote in imdb that they don't need to explain and add chilling sounds to make a scene scary,
""They are the one who holds their punches.""
Cinema requires music ,it requires a score for expressing every characters deepest emotions in a particular scene. Midsommar was so dreadfully silent,
Why? The invisible man (new one) was silent!
Why would you do something like that when you have the perfect tool to win everybody's heart!? Music keeps the tension,it holds a person judging capacity.A cinema without a score is like a teenager boy trying to end his life.
Nevermind,Close to lynchian standard (m so extremely sorry for using that word) but

The audience with whom I saw the film today was laughing at what were supposed to be the most dramatic scenes. And they were correct to laugh. It is the dialogue. It is as though the screenwriters composed a 'first draft' and then inexplicably decided that it was 'good enough'. Worse still is the fact that the film is overlong by at least 30 minutes, the entire middle of the film is truly sleep inducing. The acting? It's fine. Fine for what the actors had to work with. T. Collette and Gabriel Byrne as the family's parents deserve far better. Truth is, the only reason I stayed with the film (three times I was tempted to leave) is that the professional reviewers praised it so highly I thought ... it's got to get better. It doesn't.

367,richarddillomes,Remember the name Ari Aster.,9,29 July 2019,"Released in June 2018, this movie has been on my radar for a while now, just enough to be aware of it's massive success but not really knowing what it's all about. Because of it's title, at first I thought we were getting something gruesome, like a horrible deformity passed on from one generation to the next. Surprisingly it's something different altogether and I do see why there's a comparison between this and one of the greatest horror movies of all time, The Exorcist.Hereditary is about the Graham family and the events that unfold after Annie's (played by one of the most talented actress of this generation, Toni Collette) mother passed away. Along with the bubbling strain within her family, she tries to cope and look for a way to work through everything that's been going on even going as far as attending a group therapy...or even being interested at a seance. We all have different ways of coping and this movie shows how Annie deals with struggles: by creating dioramas of the events that happened to her (reminds me of a Twilight Zone episode from years ago), sometimes she sleepwalks, and eventually the seance. Things turn for the worst here on in, as forces beyond her control encroaches on her family as she performs one last attempt to save everyone by sacrificing herself. Whether she was successful or not is up to you to find out.The movie is great because it blends the supernatural to Annie's DID (dissociative identity disorder) that by the end of it you are left asking if I should take it literally or figuratively. I read somewhere that we should take it literally and that's what even blows my mind a little more because if I took it figuratively, I can accept it, like this is really happening all in her mind. But to take it literally, it just adds a whole new layer to the experience after the fact. My mind is refusing to accept that all of what I saw were true.With that said I have to agree that it is a great movie, as there's so much to unpack especially with the writer-director Ari Aster. He wanted to go for scares that were emotionally justified instead of just cheap jump scares and he succeeds. Toni said she's the most prepared director she's worked with and it shows. The tracking shots, the editing, the lighting and cinematography were all uniformed and beautifully staged. How prepared was he? He had a 75-page shot list for the the cinematography even before they found their location. He also started building his network of collaborators years before the movie was even approved. If this wasn't a labor of love then I don't know what is. It is awesome to see one's hard work rewarded with the success it's gotten and fortunately for us, he has 10 other screenplays and I'm already looking forward to each one of them. Remember the name, Ari Aster.Now while everyone is raving how it's one of the greatest horror movies of all time, I would have to disagree. It's not yet, anyway. It's a very good movie, a well-prepared one. My only issue was it was kind of Stop-and-Go for me. There are scenes built up for suspense but will not follow through and will leave you hanging. I'm not sure if this was a technique, building smaller suspense for a bigger one but I was kind of hung up on some scenes and to be honest at some point I just started closing my eyes not because it was scary but I was starting to get sleepy. But other than that, the performances were great, the haunting feeling is everywhere (I might skip Utah in the future), and this is definitely worth the spilled popcorn and soda.",Hereditary
368,dochito,Scary beyond belief,10,26 August 2018,THE MOST SCARY movie I ever watched!! scary beyond belief....terrific actors though.... Toni Collette best actress ever!! same goes for Alex Wolff who played as her son....,Hereditary
369,Amthermandes,"Artfully unnerving, borderline scarring",9,10 June 2018,"First of all, if anybody is accusing Hereditary of not being like The Exorcist, KNOCK IT OFF. You can't compare modern horror to a horror, let alone a CLASSIC horror, that was made over 40 years ago. This is a different era for the horror genre, with a completely different audience. And so, while there are a few minor similarities, Hereditary stands alone in its entirety. It's not like The Exorcist, and it never was intended to be. And that's a good thing. But if anybody should be comparing films, I feel the film that most feels like Hereditary is ""The Babadook,"" despite its many and obvious differences. It's also just as enjoyable. Hereditary is about a family coping with a loss, an estranged grandmother with a mysterious background. They struggle to trust one another, and it seems from the start the relationships between them are damaged. There are trust issues, alongside paranoia. On top of it all, the mother starts to uncover a dreadful truth about their deceased matriarch. Things get creepy, and dark, and genuinely scary. There are rave reviews out there, as well as negative, but the rating speaks for itself. How rare to find a modern horror to have above a 6.5 on IMDB, so obviously without having to see it, you should know the film is doing something right. And it is indeed. The whole of it is unnerving. The atmosphere is chilling, much to the help of the score and excellent performances of all the actors. The flow and directing, on top of cinematography all play an effective part in the story, and is unique in its own way. I especially love the plot device of the miniatures, and how the family's home from outside can be debated as real or a model, which invokes doubt of what is real and what is not.Unfortunately, while I give this film high praise, I cannot love it. The director's goal was to ""upset audiences on a very deep level."" He not only succeeded in this, but he may have been too effective. This is NOT a ""fun"" movie. It will be disturbing to many, ESPECIALLY the religious. And do not bring children to it, unless you want a visit from child protective services. On a personal note, it has been many years since I've been tempted to leave the theater during a film, and never before has it been a film that I was currently enjoying. And such it was with me for this film. I found myself emotionally attached, and those emotions were being ripped apart in such a way that I was becoming a tad upset, which hasn't happened in a long time. I was enjoying it, yet at the same time, loathing what it was doing. But everybody's different. Can't say many will share a similar experience. So I still recommend it, highly. But be warned, it gets crazy.",Hereditary
370,petera00,Wayyyy overhyped and done by a person who does not respect the horror genre at all,4,30 June 2018,"Ok... This wasnt a bad movie... But you literally have to break this movie up in 2 parts. The first act is pure drama. It's about a family who is grieiving over the loss of family members. The other act was a ghost story. I you love ghost stories it's not bad. The acting by Byrne and Collette and the boy is really the most intriguing part of the movie. Though, I am suspect to A24 and what they're trying to do with this elevated horror genre. Movies like the loved ones, hills have eyes and Eli Roth's cabin fever have and are honestly better movies. If you loved the quiet ones, babadook and the witch then you'll love this movie. I thought it was wrought with too much indie bs and really couldn't get my head around the fact that this filmmaker tried desperately to combine indie elements into horror. The sad part is he has no respect for the genre and that to me kills my feelings on this movie. I do not respect someone like Krosinski and Lester who have no respect for the genre and badmouth it every chance they get and then turn it and try to reframe it as smart horror. It's not. It's purely boring indie movies because they know indie movies dont sell anymore. They go into a genre and make a movie without even considering the splatter pack from the 2000's... If you are a true horror fan such as myself who loves monster movies such as Hammer's movies, the 70's sploitation and 80's movies such as Street Trash, etc... Do not watch this movie and do not support Ari Lester's film career. He doesn't belong in a genre that made people like Bava, Argento, Coscarelli and Fulci great. Get out as fast as you can.",Hereditary

OMG...
Never have I ever had such an emotional ride in terror in a horror movie until now.
This is one of the most emotionally torturous, scarring, terrifying movies I have experienced!
No... it's not blood and gore and disturbing torture disturbing... but an actual ride through emotional hell kind of disturbing. I have watched this movie multiple times and it still has the same affect on me. I get everything that goes on throughout the film to understand that ENDING! Absolutely brilliant movie!

373,KyleLicht,I Have Never Been More Uncomfortable,10,8 July 2018,"Horror movies are supposed to be scary, right? Well this movie is very scary but that's not what makes it a horror movie. The horror in this film is the sheer uncomfortability throughout the entire experience. The majority of the film is neither satanic nor paranormal. It's a very uncomfortable drama with a lot of anticipation for something scary to happen. Things are weird and things are unsettling but that's it. Fir a while. 
The first part that made me cringe was the decapitation. It was sudden, horrifying, and absolutely scarring. Especially, as Peter simply shuts down. It happens and he doesn't go to look at her and he doesn't do anything but drive home and lay in bed, never acknowledging what happened. We don't even truly know if she was decapitated. All we see is the mother crying in several settings, including the funeral, and then finally, a sudden close-up of Charlie's bug infested head on the side of the road. What an absolute nightmare!
Not only is the film extremely uncomfortable up to that point, but then it becomes legitimately scary on top of it. Suspense, fear, an uncomfortable sensation that won't go away. This movie messed me up and made me truly disturbed. Well done. There's imagery of the mother clung to the ceiling, violently and rhythmically bashing her head into the attic door. Previous to this shot, we hear banging on the door but it doesn't seem practical as it's a door on the ceiling and she's on the ground. Then we see that imagery and it just made me sigh out loud. Then, there's naked smiling people hiding in shadows, and Peter's reflection is of himself smiling, and there's decapitaed corpses in the attic and there's the mother cutting her own head off with a wire and then other sorts of fun stuff. 
Another horrifying aspect is that of control. In school the characters were talking about if a story is more tragic is a character can control their fate. In this case I think it's more tragic that they can't control their fate. The mother was under some sort of possession and we can tell there's a true mother wanting to protect her kids vs the demon that has another agenda. The demon mother is shown sneering at her son at the table like an angry child, she screams at him about trying to abort him (then we see the true mother stop herself and immediately apologizing as she didn't know why she said that), and then entire sequence of her crawling on the ceiling trying to chase her son from bashing her head through the door to slicing through her own throat with a wire. We're rooting for the mom to save her son (like the one in The Babadook). We witness her horrible journey throughout the whole film and were skeptical of her, her true good intentions, and if she's possessed or not. Then, we see her discover the truth about everything and attempt to save everyone and defeat the bad guys. However, this immediately leads to her loss of control, her leading to her son's fate and then to her very gruesome and horrifying death. 
Likewise, the poor son is being tortured throughout this whole movie. He barely did anything wrong. His sister's death is very controversial in terms of fault. Yes, he was high while driving. Yes, he was speeding. Yes, he should've kept a closer eye on his sister. However, he didn't have to bring Charlie, that was his moms decision. Charlie wasn't careful and got into an allergic trouble. Being a great brother, he immediately reacted to the situation and tried to save her. He ran out of the house away from his crush, carrying his sister in his arms. As she's losing her ability to breathe, he speeds down the road trying to reach the hospital and tries to comfort her on the way. We're rooting for him because he's finally doing something good and we don't want Charlie to die. When Charlie puts her head out the window, it's not his fault. He was going fast but that was to save her life and he was high but there's no way he could've forseen this happening. Also, it's completely bad luck that as she had her head out the window, there'd be a dead animal in the road and a pole that would lead to her decapitation. There's a lot going on here and we can't entirely blame Peter for her death. Also, was it really just bad luck? This could easily be part of the master plan. It's no coincidence she was decapitated as the other female family members were. It would make sense to stage this because Charlie would be dead and the family, especially their target Peter, would be vulnerable. This way they could put Charlie's soul into Peter's body, as they do in the end. 
With this torture, Peter is also tortured in school and haunted constantly. He is even possessed and forced to smash his face into his desk. With this, he's constantly dead looking and even cries like a child throughout the movie. It's heartbreaking to see and crushing, because he can't do anything about it. He finally fights back in the end, but dies in his attempt to escape. He was never in control which makes it that much more tragic. This film is Rosemary's Baby meets The Babadook meets The Amityville Horror. The mix of suspense, gore, terror, and uncomfortability is absolutely perfect and horrendous for a horror film. It succeeds the cliches and jump-scare-relying films that we normally get. Hereditary is a gem, masterpiece, unconventional addition to the genre, homage to the classics, and one of the most true depictions of terror and fear I've ever seen.",Hereditary

A very complete horror film that is not only there to cause chills and screams, but it is a story that has everything. Wonderful acting by the cast which also elevated the film to a new status. As the movie progresses, audiences is drawn to the picture waiting how every scene unfolds, to me that is the definition of a great film. Let's just hope we can sleep tonight",Hereditary
377,tstudstrup,Pretty bad.,3,23 December 2018,"The acting is generally very good. Except from Gabriel Byrne, but he doesnt have much to do in it. Alex Wolff and Toni Collette are outstanding as the tormented son and his mother. The weird looking Milly Shapiro, who seems to be the lead in the very misleading trailer, is okay, but shes not much in the movie. And the movie is more weird and ridicouluys plotwise, than it is actually scary.
*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*It starts with Annies (Toni Collette) mother who has just died a while before the movie starts. They go to the funeral.
A few weeks later, Charlie (Milly Shapiro) who is allergic to nuts, is forced to go to a party with her older brother Peter (Alex Wolff) At the party she eats cake with nuts in it while her brother smokes weed with his friend. Peter rushes Charlie to the hospital , but they never make it there. Charlie cant breathe and opens the window. To avoid hitting a dead animal on the road, Peter makes a hard turn and Charlies head hits a post and she is decapitated.
From this scene on, the movie gets really weird and really bad. Now instead of calling an ambulance and the cops and his parents, like a normal person would do, Peter drives home to his parents, house with his sisters headless corpse in the backseat and goes to bed. This is not normal behaviour in a situation like that. The next morning his mother finds Charlies corpse in the car.
She starts goes to a sorrow group therapy session. At the group she meets the seemingly nice Joan, who later on tricks her into a spiritual session that awakens one of 8 kings of hell. Apparently Charlie was never Charlie. She was this demon king. Her body was just a temporary vessel and the older brother Peter is the vessel the demon prefers at it has to be a male body.
And appeearently Annie and her brother, that killed himself as a teenager were nothing but pawns in the late grandmothers scheme. She was a satanist (whos only goal in life was to give a body to the demonking) and leader of an insane satanist cult, whose members walk around naked when they perform rituals. So appeerarently this plan to resurrect that demonking has been the cults plan for at least 45 years. Yes its that ridicoulus. And it's very long.
I dont mind major twists in horrormovies. That is usually what makes them good. But it's just not believabe that this had been planned for nearly 50 years and the grandmother only had kids to have vessels for the demonking.
I'm only giving it 3 stars, because of the acting from the two leads and because of the cinematography, which is also really goodDon't waste your time on this crap.",Hereditary

382,michaelgarykelley1994,"Surprising, But I'm Not Completely Into It",7,24 January 2019,"You know, in many ways, ""Hereditary"" could be one of the best-looking, and most well-made horror films in years. In other ways, a horror afficianado like myself-who's seen almost everything out there-won't be phased by this movie much. There are some genuinely creepy things in ""Hereditary"", but there's a lot of silliness to it, as well. There are some big surprises, and yet there are some oddball, bizarre things that I think make the film a little laughable. But I actually did like it, despite the barely-above-average rating I've given it. It's a solid flick. It clearly had a brain behind it, whom actually cared about the project, I believe.The cast was mostly great, but, frankly, I can't stand the little girl or the mother. At least I could relate to the mother. That little girl was getting on my last nerve, clicking her tongue over and over again. She wasn't bad, but her habits were driving me bonkers. The mother was too busy hating her son for a horrific tragedy that happens to their whole family, for most of the film, for the actress to actually give a really great performance. She's certainly not bad, but I do believe she could have been exceptional. The father and son, I believe, did exceptionally well-but, especially, the father actor. The man was freaking brilliant! One of the best performances I've seen in years, when it comes to the horror genre!The writing is aiming for a tone that's much more about grief, loss, and hefty, drowning depression a family can go through. And it works beautifully, in that regard. For a good half-hour of the film, I wasn't engaged very much. It was okay. Average, at best. But then something completely unexpected happened, and the execution of the film, after that, drastically improved, until it went right up my alley for intrigue. I believe some parts, in the third act, were what kind of lowered my excitement again, even though I believe the ending to be immensely chilling-again, not so much for the content as the execution of that very content. I've said it before, but let me restate: it's a very bizarre, weird film, but I think mainstream audiences will be much more interested in this movie than-let's say- something like ""The Witch"" (which I absolutely hated, for the most part).The atmosphere of ""Hereditary"" is what kept me going, as well. I really dug how dark the film was, even if I thought a few events were laughable. It CAN be scary, and it doesn't try too hard to do that. A film this felt so much like, when it comes to the atmosphere, was ""Sinister"". If you enjoy the long points of silence leading-up to pure terror in ""Sinister"", then I must recommend ""Hereditary"" to you, because that's constantly how it feels.The music was absolutely brilliant, and eerie. Very ""Silent Hill""-esque, in my opinion. It helps build the terrifying atmosphere super well, and I would even say I'd buy the soundtrack, due to how good the music was, here. It was very well-implemented.The cinematography and sets (mainly the house of the family we follow, since that's where most of the film takes place) are extraordinary. It was all so vivid, and the directing added a dreamlike (more nightmarish, honestly) texture to the film that I think you'd have a hard time forgetting. Again: there was nothing but passion put into this film, and I appreciate that, even if I'm not in love with the movie, overall.There aren't many jumpscares, either, if you happen to be wondering. But I would say the scares are mostly implemented in the third act-where they can be very hit-or-miss for a major horror fan. This is not a date night-type horror film to take your teenaged girlfriend to. This is a FILM-a real piece of cinema that's dark and haunting. Haunting is the best word to use for ""Hereditary"". The feeling still hasn't washed-off of me after almost going twenty-four hours after seeing it. It feels like a primal type of fear, or something; I'm not sure how to explain it to someone who hasn't seen it yet. It's just so DIFFERENT, and I'm happy about that, also.I'm a little surprised that so many people love the movie, and are preaching its gospel everywhere, to everyone. I liked it, but I didn't come close to adoring it. I'm glad, as well-put-together as it was, that it's audience has really come to adopt it and cherish it. I don't even think you could refer to this as more of a cult hit; it's actually good, unlike a lot of cult-fandom films.I'm impressed, and you might be, too, if you try this movie out, sometime.

As a person who never gets scared by a fright flick, this one plays as a very engrossing and truly scary film showcasing events that are paranormal. You can find all of these kinds of actual displays in the psi literature. As a side point it is a valid example of dissociative or multiple personality disorder-type scenes. The ending will never be guessed by anyone who has not been clued in, so do not spoil it for yourself.The only problem with the film is the title because it implies that bad genes are somehow in play here.

The abbreviated resolution of the film is going to fail for most viewers because of the scenes clearly cut out of a longer, more detailed version.This film makes me wonder about the Motives for telling this nightmare story.

Hereditary does this perfectly. After a family's grandmother dies, the family, especially the mother begins to deal with many unsettling occurrences that may or may not be linked to said grandmother's death.This is a very investing horror drama movie. It uses both genres really well, with the first half acting as the drama portion and the second half acting as the horror portion with sprinkles of horror elements in the beginning. It acts as slow build up to the movie's ending, and it's not quite prominent until the final fifteen minutes since it uses show, don't tell rather than mountains of exposition. The majority of the movie uses show don't tell very effectively in general. There are many quiet scenes that bring up many mysteries such as a light coming from the treehouse, which are very thought provoking.In the beginning, the grandmother was stated to be very secretive and often kept things hidden from even her own daughter. This puts her in a suspicious light when we gradually find out about some of the actions that her family has been put through. I gotta admit, it's both interesting and unsettling as to how they unravel the mystery.And yes this movie was unsettling, especially during the third act. I was on the edge by the final 30 minutes and was quite terrified by the actions performed against the family. Again, it's the concepts portrayed in the movie that scare me. There were little to no cheesy jumpscares; if the movie was filled with jumpscares, it'd get old, but thankfully there were none. There were moments where I was really uncomfortable in the theater because of what was happening. The acting was also really well done, especially from Alex Wolff, who plays the teenage son. As the main character, he was incredible. He was not just convincing in this role, but it felt like he lived and breathed the role as he ended up being the one who suffered the most throughout the movie.I overall loved Hereditary, even though it's not something I see myself watching again. I loved the acting, the suspense, the shift in mood and the unsettling vibe of the movie. This movie, I think will please any true horror enthusiast.10/10",Hereditary

The movie relies on a slow build up with an intense climatic showdown. Despite having some creepy visuals, it was not as scary as it was atmospheric. The ending seems out of place and acts to make it less scary. Nonetheless it is a good suspenseful movie that takes some unexpected turns, especially near the beginning",Hereditary
389,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,Creepy at times,6,24 October 2021,"First the positive: 'Hereditary' was definitely creepy at times, with some pretty good visuals here and there. Maybe the best were the car scene with the two kids and the body levitating to the tree house at the end, both of which involved decapitations (more on that in a few). There were unnerving instances of dread for sure and ""oh crap now what?"" going through my head. So it did its job for the most part. The ending, though, was not good (more on that later, too) and in retrospect there is a lot of clutter in this film that holds it back from being great. It's good, but it's not great.One thing I've noticed is a lot of reviews here calling 'Hereditary' original. It's really not. If you've seen 'Rosemary's Baby,' then you will recognize the general outline. Both stories involve a person who is part of a Satanic cult, and works with that cult to 'use' another family member to further the cult's devilish aims. In 'Rosemary's Baby,' it was a husband and the cult doing it to his wife; here, it's a woman and the cult doing it to her children and then grandchildren. So that's definitely twisted, but it's hardly original.As I mentioned there is a fair amount of clutter here, and by that I mean ""things that are introduced into the story that don't amount to anything."" The best films show you things for a reason and those things play a role in the telling of the story. When we are shown things as part of the story that wind up not meaning anything, it's clutter. The most obvious of these is the multiple decapitations in the film. The daughter removes the head of a dead bird, she later winds up decapitated herself in a car accident, the grandmother's body is dug up from its grave and is later found without its head, and the mother cuts off her own at the end. And for what? None of this is ever explained as to what all of these beheadings are supposed to mean. And here's the kicker - apparently they don't mean anything. In an interview, the writer-director of 'Hereditary' (Ari Aster) refused to give any sort of explanation for them in the film. Well that's great. But guess what it winds up making your film somewhat convoluted if you can't explain why you put it in there in the first place.There are other issues. Another would be the first time Annie throws her daughter's book in the fire, she catches fire herself, but the second time she does it, her husband immolates instead. Why the incongruity? No idea, not explained. And towards the end, when we learn that this King of Hell needs a male host, which is targeted to be the son Peter, why is a possessed Annie chasing him down, seemingly with the intent on harming him, if his body is needed to be a host? That doesn't make any sense when you think about it. His body needs to remain intact so the demon can inhabit it. But if a possessed Annie gets her hands on him, and kills him, the whole purpose of the cult's machinations are ruined (and so would be the film's story). That's not good writing.But the ending is a real head-scratcher and not in a good way. At the end, the son Peter is apparently possessed by not one but two entities - this King of Hell demon AND his dead sister Charlie. Well, which is it? Or is it both? Idk but that's confusing and not helpful for the story. Even worse, Peter sees that the decapitated bodies of his mother and grandmother have been set up in worshipping poses in front of him. That makes sense I guess for the grandmother, as she was part of the cult, but the mother never was. So why is her headless body set up there at all? That doesn't flow with the story. But worst of all, Peter has to be told by a cult member that he is now the living embodiment of the King of Hell demon. And they bend down and worship him. So that means he doesn't know that himself. He had to be told. And if you look at Peter's face, that's pretty much confirmed, as he has no idea what's going on. He doesn't seem to know that he is this demon they keep talking about. And that's a massive problem with this story, because if he doesn't know he's the demon, how is he supposed to reward them with the riches they expect, the reason the cult exists in the first place? That would mean that everything the cult had done to this point would amount to nothing if Peter doesn't know who he is. This ending left a massive 'well that makes no sense' question in my mind that simply cannot be answered logically. And that's a shame.6/10. Overall it's a pretty good effort but even for a supernatural film it doesn't quite hold up to close scrutiny. As I said, good not great.

390,Martinito_08183,One of the best horror movies of the decade.,9,30 November 2019,"It's no secret that making your first feature-length movie is not a easy task and everything can go very badly all of the time. There are many reasons of why your first movie may not good at all and the biggest reason (which is very common) is when you don't have any experience with directing and even screenwriting and for that not only you will suffer, but also everyone, who was involved in the making of the movie as well.Making your first movie good (or even great) happens very rarely, so i'm not going to hide my surprise when i was ""Hereditary"" for the first time back in March (unfortunately not in the cinema) and after seeing it - i fell in love with the movie. Ari Aster created something that is so unique and fascinating from the beginning to the end. It was the first horror movie in years that affected me so much and i'll also point out that it's rare for me to get goosebumps, while watching a horror movie. The only horror movies that affected me the most are ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (the original, not the remake), ""Psycho"" (i should also count the remake, even remembering that a terrible remake or even a remake in general of a classic by Alfred Hitchcock exists is terrifying) and ""Alien"".The story was very engaging from the beginning and the dynamic between the family was great. The way the story was building up for the events that will happen in the ending was overall great, seeing how the family goes insane throughout the movie and having moments that i can still recall, which i loved and shocked me in my first viewing.The acting (for the most part) was great. Toni Collette was the one, who stands out the most. She was fantastic and gave one of the best performance of 2018. I don't hide the fact that i was shocked that she didn't got a Academy Awards nomination, but they chose to give that nomination to Melissa McCarthy. I know that the Academy are terrible of picking the winner for every category in every year, but for the nominations - that was a horrible choice from their side.The characters are very compelling and the way Toni Collette's character was written - it felted more like a character study, which is a great thing, since it wasn't a normal horror movie that has jump scares and i do consider it more as a drama with horror elements. The scene where the characters have dinner is no doubt the best scene in the movie. I do have a problem with one of the characters, but i'll save it for later.The dialogue was fantastic and the interactions between all of the characters were very believable and it does deliver moments of emotion throughout it's dialogue.The cinematography was great and there are many shots that are just visually appealing, especially the beginning shot that was fantastic.The editing was also great. The editor knew when to cut from one shot to another and how much time the shot will stay before he did a cut.The music was very atmospheric and it really did make the movie great for me.With the positives also comes the negatives. Like i mentioned: I loved all of the characters, but i didn't like that the husband / father still doesn't believe everything that his wife is telling him, even with the proof that she has - he still thinks that his wife is crazy. This only happens in the end of the movie and it can be viewed as a small complaint, but i still wanted to mention it. The actor Alex Wolff, who portrays the son Peter wasn't all that convincing in some moments and his crying was very weird. He does a great job when he is scared, but overall he doesn't do a good job.Even though i praised the music - i do have problems with that aspect. After re-watching the movie and listening to the soundtrack there are some tracks that are not all that memorable and the composer did reuse some of the music in some moments. I'm not a huge fan, when composers do reuse the same track over and over again and ""Hereditary"" is not the first movie that does this. It may not be a problem for many, but for me it was and i wanted to point out the flaws that i have with the music.Overall i loved the movie. It's a movie that left an impression on me after i saw it for the first time and i wanted to see it again, but i had to be careful, because if i see a movie multiple times every year - i'll get sick of it very easily and probably never going to watch it ever again. After re-watching it i did spot some things that i didn't in my first viewing, which was very cool. It was a fantastic experience from beginning to the end and i'll even say that it's not only one of the best movies of 2018, but also one of the best horror movies of the decade and i'm giving ""Hereditary"" a 9.2/10.",Hereditary

392,A_Llama_Drama,Family horror at its best,10,28 December 2018,"Something I've found myself asking over the years is: what's passed down to us from our parents and their parents? What unlucky numbers did we inherit, which bad gene or nasty outlook did we have no choice but to accept from those who came before us? ""Hereditary,"" Ari Aster's first full feature length takes that question and delivers one of the most disturbing answers through a highly stylised, tightly created descent into madness.Annie has lost her mother to, what sounds like, ill mental health. The grief of the loss, the blame she feels, and the pressure of keeping herself together for her family's sake are causing her severe stress. What begins as a slow burn family drama that sees her despondent son, Peter, turn to drugs for comfort and her daughter, Charlie, to obscenely isolating acts of art, takes a brutal curve ball and from that moment begins to unravel every member of the family.Horror works at its best when you don't see it coming, and ""Hereditary"" works hard to keep you in the dark until the final act without losing you to confusion or boredom. It does this by offering up the flawed and human family going through a traumatic loss. Annie and her brood are relatable in their desire to work through the issues, all while their worlds collapse around them. The tones and themes explored are all troubling and difficult to approach, but Aster and the cast work so well to keep it all together from start to finish.Before the acts of gore and violence begin, the film works well to create an uneasy filter to see the family through. As Annie, Toni Collette looks like she's barely together from the very start, so to see her bad parenting and her own husband's suspicions of her actions doesn't ever feel improbable. The use of close ups and quick cuts gives a palpable sense of terror that builds throughout endless scenes of school hallways, entrance halls, a tree house and Annie's workshop. Everyone's grief and despair adds on and on into every scene and bad decisions are not hard to understand.The light in it all is Joanie, a friendly face who offers Annie a listening ear and the knowledge to contact the dead in search of answers. Ann Dowd is perfect as the grieving homebody, nurturing, if a little needy and imposing. Contrast her light scenes with the family dinners, or Annie's inability to articulate at all with Peter, Charlie or her husband, Stephen. There may not be villains within the family, but they're all far too damaged to support each other when it's needed.""Hereditary"" really pays off all its meticulous efforts to twist the screws. By the time the horrors are coming out of the shadows and blood is flowing, it feels mightily cathartic, yet still deeply harrowing thanks to so much care put into developing the suffering family. The final tableau of horrors, juxtaposed with the caring voices and joyous score is one that could remain spoken about in horror circles for years.10/10",Hereditary
393,Eclectic-Boogaloo,It doesn't add up,5,4 January 2019,"The miniatures, the tree house, the clucking, the flies, the nightmares, the fire, the plot reveal, and on and on. They felt like a checklist of elements put to the audience expectating that we'll buy-in based on our emotions and look past the lack of a unifying theme.Save for the brilliant sequence towards the end of the first act I was never once disturbed or scared. And that's down to the arbitrary nature of the film. Scares have to be set up, be they jump scares or psychological frights.The great scene at the end of act one aside, the real highlight of the movie was Toni Collette's fantastic lead performance.

395,neener3707,"Hellish, Terrifying, Perfect",10,8 June 2018,"I don't even know where to begin with this one. When I heard that it was being made by some of the same people who worked on The Witch (which some people didn't like, but I liked it), I had high hope for this film, and boy was I not disappointed. Such a breath of fresh air for the genre in a time where Hollywood has prostituted it and released nothing but garbage. Not only was the film scary as hell, but it also had a lot to say about grief and trauma. The way the film is put together is its strongest part. The pacing, the editing, the cinematography, and the sound design all worked together to create a truly unique and hellish vision of horror. I'm a horror veteran, and rarely actually jump or feel tense, but this film made me feel like a horror virgin again, actually frightening me like no other Hollywood film can.The acting was also superb all around and only adds to the horror being presented on screen. Each character was unique and added their own style to this modern horror masterpiece. I saw many people in the theater jumping and looking away, some being grown men. A couple people even left, and I can't imagine its because they felt it was a bad film, because it was not. I am seriously considering going and seeing it again which hasn't happened since the Evil Dead remake and The Raid. I would say this film is a must see for any horror fan or for anyone wanting to be scared out of their minds.",Hereditary

The only reason I didn't give it more stars is the ending was kind of crappy. It reminded me a lot of The Shining in terms of the descent into madness combined with supernatural occurences. A grief-stricken family tries to hold it together as the mother becomes more and more unglued - or is she? Is her hysteria justified? Does Grandma want to save her grandson from beyond the grave or does she want more? What is a husband to do while his wife loses her grip on reality? Or should he be forewarned and heed her advice? This could have a been a classic if not for the dissatisying ending. Very scary, I will be sleeping with the lights on tonight.",Hereditary

400,RetroRick,the kids aren't all right,8,23 August 2018,"A movie that divides people in the way that this film does is typically a good sign but in this case the issue probably goes deeper than 'you'll either love or hate it'. This is a film you either will or won't invest in, and that will partly be about your expectations about what a horror film is; what a horror film should or shouldn't be. I suspect that many who dislike it will simply object to the emotional cost of entry: it isn't pleasant or fun for the most part, and while the film certainly has its forerunners neither is it clear what the rules are, or indeed what the genre is. That in itself is unsettling and no doubt intentionalThose who end invest will find themselves buying into what is an exquisite nightmare that gets worse by every turn. I was going to say it moves inexorably towards its conclusion. I'm not entirely sure whether it does. Once it arrives the end will either leave you gob-smacked or dissatisfied. It is only at that point perhaps that it is clear what the film is, and where it's comparisons are to be found. Quite a few on these boards have compared have compared this to the exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. Personally I think only the latter is an appropriate comparison, but while that film is a work of brilliance in many ways Hereditary goes further. There is none of the cosiness of the former film. No sense that evil might be fun, a club that might have exclusive benefits worth the price of admission. Yet oddly and disturbingly it is only at this conclusion, the apogee of the nightmare rather than its dissipation that there is anything like repose. I'm not sure this is a film that everyone or even most people will enjoy, and for that reason it might be worth thinking about whether its your cup of tea before you buy the tickets. Much of it is unpleasant rather than scary and the subject matter is uncomfortable to say the least. The story involves the destruction of a family and there is nothing in that that will make you feel good, however it does create the conditions for the cast to do some wonderful acting. All of the cast are good but the standout performance is most definitely Toni Colette's. Her scene at the bereavement encounter group was just so good and effortlessly natural and I struggle to think of any other actress who could have pulled off her part so well. Personally I think Frances McDormand, in comparison is over-rated and Collette acts the latter under the table in this film. I really do hope she gets recognition for this role.Did I like it? I'm not sure. Probably no, but I do think it was very good, and presents some fine innovation in terms of refreshing the horror genre. It is overlong, and slow for much of the first half of the film, but the momentum gets going in the second half",Hereditary
401,hamidullahgenc,"Why are we afraid of an honorable death?.. Not funny, little girl.",8,15 June 2018,"The girl. Start with the girl, shall we?..We do not have to worry over the girl as to why people 'd place her in this kind of a movie or, why people 'd get scared more than they should during a given movie just because this girl plays in the movie. People could feel entrapped listening to the sound of nature, or brighten up watching a documentary on war, or dream for better in front of a Tv channel that broadcasts Somalian hunger... or feel devastated right after feeding a poor monkey. That is absurd... not to judge. But hey, people cannot behave in conformity with the prospect of generalisation. This is why any rule must be of an authority that is higher than that of a single person or a petite community... namely God. So, the deed of casting this girl (oh, should we praise the girl, for the fact that she looks different, by saying ""this angel"", or ""this beautiful girl?"") may not have anything to do with the fearsomeness of the script and the movie; only God knows.The script is so down to earth, and dramatic for a horror movie. And the director executes it rather well, only with the contribution of the actors in from of a brilliant acting. Especially the way Ms. Toni Collette performs makes it hard to believe that this is a horror movie at all! What's more is that Mr. Alex Wolff devotes himself to the task. On top of all, the long-take scenes render the movie to be of the artistic venture. We wait, we see, and we experience. By the way, where is ""the technique"" of jump scare to be seen throughout the movie?.. This is good.The happenings in the movie seem near-natural than magical. The bird, the car accident, the allergical fit, the sleepwalking, the worship at the end... All but the scenes of possessed Annie. Also, the music with no unsettling tunes and timing is not abrupt but different. All these do refresh the movie.Maybe this is not a horror movie, under newly-thought-upon considerations, that it has strong drama, powerful acting, a dark but real-like script. We may call this genre... horama?..

402,DVR_Brale,Psychological and occult terror which builds and culminates at the very end,6,20 June 2018,"Most of the top IMDb Hereditary reviews are sheer extravagance - reading them might leave you feeling disappointed at the end of the movie
------------What kind of movie is Hereditary? It's a movie where almost everything that happens serves as material for the final culmination. There are no particularly scary scenes until the very end; they tend to put you in a state of discomfort rather than scaring you in a classical sense. As the movie approaches final culmination you can already feel tired of being disturbed by frenzy you've seen so far. Who's going to 'enjoy' this movie? Probably everyone who's 'enjoyed' The Witch (A24 production as well) and Sinister (starring Ethan Hawke; stay away from the second part) both of which I recommend. Hereditary can even be described as a combination of the two: it has soundtrack and violence similar to Sinister and psychological terror peculiar to The Witch. As a result, Hereditary delivers both psychological terror and occult terror which don't stand separated but are interlaced. This fact is very important in creating such a sorrowful atmosphere.To be frank, there are some boring instances here and there, but I don't think they are without meaning. Critics gave this movie high rating for a reason and I think the reason is different aspects and sources of the terror being cleverly put together by those very scenes which do break the dynamic but give you reasons to think about the movie afterwards.Combination of which elements and to what proportions lead to all the tragedy and sorrow this family struggled against? The way Hereditary puts forward this question is what ultimately makes it a good movie.

So now we get the same movie with the same occult story but without the blood and gore. It is stupid.If it is supposed to satisfy a small group of fans of this kind of movies, great.

You dont start doing research and watch other videos just to understand what is going on in a movie and force yourself to like it. It is a movie. Not a college essay.I give this movie a low rating. It does not qualify as a horror movie and because somebody out there even thought to compare it with one of the greatest movies of all times.Bottom line, there is no such thing as a slow burning horror film. It is confusing. Just do a horror film man.

The first 40 minutes had its share of mild, escalating creepiness but then BAM! The game changed, and nearly took my head off with it. *cluck* I would ask ""what did I just watch?"" except I'm pretty sure I just watched the best horror film I've seen in years, and one of the best I've ever seen, period.

409,jcooloti,This movie really affects everyone differently.,10,12 November 2020,"Some people hate this film. It literally makes them angry. It has such a deeply subconscious effect on people that some people process it in a way that leads to disdain. One things for sure, this movie makes the average viewer extremely uncomfortable. It seems to bask in the elements of life that most people have a hard tome coping with. Mainly grief, but also the notion that we are dictated by roles that are put upon us that we were born into. Even our roles as women or men... it's an extremely ""unfair"" story that is sort of a reflection on our own lives. It's depressing and brutal. But that's why I love this movie and why a lot of other people do to. I like being tortured. I like being reminded that life is unfair and sometimes there's nothing you can do about it. The thought of that really frightens me. It's completely horrifying. And that's what it really comes down to me. The horror. It's a really frightening movie. Some people might process the film differently though. They might try to ignore it or call it stupid or silly. There's nothing stupid or silly about this movie. It's deep and will affect you. You might not take it well. All of the hate for this movie reminds me of all the hate Stephen King's the Shining received upon release. Now we study it in film school. There were so many subliminal elements to Kubrick's Shining and I believe there are a lot in this movie as well and the results really affect people. It's masterful film making in my opinion. It's awesome. Movies don't always have to be a ""good time"". Sometimes they are made to destroy us. This movie destroyed me and will haunt me for the rest of my life. I truly believe people will be talking about and studying this film for a long time. It's ahead of its time. if I have any advice for anyone about to watch this movie for the first time I would say don't expect to feel good afterwords.

It has some jumpy moments but not too many, the film is like a horrifying downward spiral which is quite uncomfortable to watch but it keeps you there, keeping you engrossed like a good well made scary movie should.
The criticism is that it doesn't know if it's a horror or a supernatural drama. So the later stages of the film seem that it is written by someone different to the first part and leaves you wanting.

From the trailers, I gathered that this would be an okay horror movie with annoying jump scares. After seeing the initial reviews I had to give this a try on opening weekend. I am happy that I did. Hereditary is more of a slow-burning thriller with an interesting story and a stellar cast. Toni Collette is the stand out and she really carries this film through its weaker spots to hold the viewer's attention. She plays a mother who has been through tragedy her whole life and will have to deal with more after her mother's passing. The events that follow will test the whole family's strength. Many of the scenes are dark much darker than I ever expected and they are even more impactful given how grounded this film is. This was simply exciting to watch; I was engrossed from beginning to end. I have heard others say that this is too long given how long the movie takes to pick up.

If people say ""it was the way it lead you to believe it's not supernatural that's good"" then it's still not enough because they could still twist it again and return to it not being supernatural.

418,jmerlino,"Great movie, but lacks a sense of fun",8,22 October 2020,"First things first: Hereditary is an exclellent, well made, tightly plotted film which is true to it's aesthetic, well acted (Toni Collette is superb and Gabriel Byrne is restrained, but fully believable). I give it 8 stars. It's truly a great movie.That said, I'm not sure it's really a horror movie. It seems to be more of a meditation on grief and loss than anything else. It's a complete downer from start to finish, and less ""scary"" than punishing and depressing. Such movies exist without the horror element (Leaving Las Vegas comes to mind), but I imagine they're a tough sell at the production level.To me, the horror elements felt completely unnecessary. I was far more scared by Charile going into anaphylaxis because Peter was too busy trying to get a girl stoned at the party to keep an eye on her, than I was by Pymon the demon. (And FFS, why didn't Charlie carry an Epi-pen with her?)But what really bugged me about this movie was that it had no sense of fun at all. For me, that's sort of an essential element of a horror movie. I'm not saying they all have to be horror/comedies. Sometimes you can sense a director's glee at playing with an interesting concept or you can get the sense of fun from from the villain's excitement, or even the victim's reaction.For example, in The Exorcist, the crazy stuff Reagan does and says are fun, even if the mood of the film is somber and horrific. In ""The Changeling"" (another film centered around grief and loss) the sense of fun comes from seeing George C. Scott's relentless drive to get to the bottom of what's going on.Here, there's none of that. Just relentless, crushing grief and depression for the entire length of the film. The Joanie character could have been fun, but she doesn't have a big enough role. For me, that's enough to drop it from ""all time great"" to ""excellent, but lacking"".",Hereditary
419,dhainline1,Family Secrets Destroy a Family Already on the Edge,10,8 January 2019,"Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is a wife and mother with a stable, much older husband, Steve (Gabriel Bryne) a pot smoking son in his mid teens named Peter (Alex Wolff) and a 13 year old withdrawn, unusual daughter named Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Annie and Charlie are both artists. Annie creates miniatures as a living and she even creates mini worlds of events in her life. Charlie, who barely talks and vocalizes like a chicken, makes little figurines out of discarded materials such as old bottles and even a dead bird's head. With the exception of a black dress to her maternal grandmother's funeral, Charlie wears a large orange hoodie and jeans.
The family trauma comes to a head when Annie's mother, Leigh dies. Annie had an unhappy home life as a child. Her father starved himself to death when she was a baby. Her brother, Charles whom Charlie was named after, hung himself in their mother's room when he was nephew Peter's age. His suicide note mentioned his mother trying to put people inside of him. His niece, Charlie was very close to her grandmother and is devastated by the loss. She clucks like a chicken, draws strange pictures in her notebook, and eats chocolate bars with a blank look on her face. Her parents have to make sure the chocolate has no nuts because of her nut allergy. Even though Annie loves Charlie and tries to help her emotionally after the funeral, Charlie wants the grandmother whom she had the unhealthy relationship with (i.e, Leigh breast fed Charlie and wanted her to be a boy).
More tragedy follows this poor family when Peter and Charlie go to a party. Charlie doesn't want to be there. Peter wants to smoke his really good weed and suggests Charlie have a piece of chocolate cake that is being offered. Unbeknownst to Peter and Charlie, there is an abhorrent amount of chopped nuts in the cake. Charlie eats the cake and has an immediate allergic reaction. Peter drives her like a bat out of hell to the emergency room. On the way, he swerved out of the way of a dead deer and hits a pole. Charlie dies when her head hits the pole and she is decapitated.
The family is paralyzed over Charlie's unnatural death. Annie is in a rage at Peter and Steve the stable one just wants things to go back to normal. That can't happen, though. Pre and post Charlie's death, Annie discovers her mom was involved in a cult that worshipped Paiman, a demon from hell who is interested in the arts and knowledge. Leigh was also artistic like her daughter and granddaughter. She embroidered welcome mats with the demon symbol on them. These mats also have the names of Annie and Charles on them and are beautiful!
Into all of this comes a kindly woman Annie met at a grief support meeting named Joan (Ann Dowd). Joan lost her son and little grandson in a drowning. She and Annie perform a seance and they communicate with Joan's grandson. Annie tries to communicate that way with Charlie but things don't go well! The fact the seance fails is an understatement! Joan is not what she seems to be! She was friends with Leigh and in the cult. The cult wants a male blood relative of Leigh's to house Paiman. Charlie's body was used to house the demon, but he didn't want a female body. They tried with Charles but he killed himself and Steve was out because he wasn't a blood relative.
In the end, the cult burns Steve up. They haul Leigh's headless body to the tree house Charlie spends time in and Annie cuts off her own head. Charlie's head is retrieved from the highway and placed on a wooden figure in the tree house. Peter throws himself out of window and is possessed by Paiman like his own mother was. He goes to the tree house and the naked cult members along with Joan crown him as Paiman.
This movie was quite a powerhouse! All the performers were excellent! Toni, Ann and Gabriel were all great and I thought the younger performers were awesome too! Milly Shapiro is so unlike the withdrawn Charlie in RL, it's unbelievable! Alex Wolff was also wonderful as Peter and I felt bad for him when he cried the way a little kid would! I recommend this movie highly! One thing I wasn't expecting was Judy Collins' lovely song ""Both Sides Now"" at the end!",Hereditary

421,venusboys3,Strange and Haunting,9,25 June 2018,"I watched this last night and it kinda freaked me out. 
NOT, because of the plot and events... which familiar stuff to anyone who has watched a lot of horror films... but because of the way it does things... the raw emotions on display and the pacing that defies Hollywood convention. It's disturbing in how it removes certain comfortable cinematic standards to amp up the horror. Most of the horror here is expressed between the characters... not running from some rubber monster. 
It takes risks, I'm sure a number of viewers saw comedy where I saw horror... saw bad acting where I saw performances I'm not used to seeing in American films. 
This isn't an overtly 'BOO!' scary movie... no jump scares... it's a slow build to a haunting feeling that stuck with me till... well, it's still with me. 
It's not for everyone, I saw it alone because I knew my friends aren't horror fans and wouldn't 'get it'. But it's above and beyond what I hoped for going in (knowing pretty much nothing about it). Anyway, great horror movie... if you love horror movies like The Haunting, The Witch, The Invitation... things without overt in-your-face monsters and BOO! moments.",Hereditary

425,rustonreviews,An unsettling masterpiece,10,19 June 2018,"The horror genre (once proclaimed a dead genre by many during the latter years of the 2000's) has been going through a real renaissance as of late. Over the last few years, the genre has revitalized itself with pictures likely to be deemed as classics in years to come, such as The Babadook (2014), The Witch (2015), Get Out (2017), as well as this year's excellent A Quiet Place, among many other low budget hits sprinkled in between. Making noise throughout the horror scene is Ari Aster's debut Hereditary, with many likening it to classics of the genre, particularly The Exorcist (1973). Such bold claims immediately had me skeptical, because whenever a new horror pictures reputation is built upon such comparisons and is reported to be ""the scariest horror film in years"", I immediately go into said pictures with trepidation. This has happened before, of course, with this years Netflix Spanish possession flick Veronica, which, I felt, was about as by the numbers as you could get. What a relief it is then to report that Aster's debut is as unsettling and horrifying as the reports have claimed. Opening with the passing of their matriarch, a family attempts to readjust. Distraught mother Annie (Collette) pours all her mourning and efforts into meticulously crafted miniature sculptures/doll houses, whilst her daughter Charlie (Shapiro) spirals into increasingly bizarre and eerie behaviour. After an incident occurs that breaks the family further, Annie crumbles into a state she seemingly cannot return from, adding increasing pressure on the family as their mourning crushingly amplifies. Regarding plot, the less you know the better, as this is a film worth going in knowing as little as possible. With Hereditary, Aster has proved himself to be a writer/director to watch. Few horror films have had the ability to get under my skin, one example being Robert Egger's New England folktale The Witch, and yet with Hereditary Aster has crafted a film involving just about everything that I personally find frightening.One of the strongest factors of the film is its ferocious, visceral punch in the face. Aster presents us with images that are bound to remain present in my memory for weeks to come, but he holds off from revealing too much too early, allowing our imagination to do the dirty work before the horror is unleashed in all it's horrifying glory. Complimenting the unsettling nature of the film is the lingering camera work courtesy of cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, who holds on particularly gruesome shots to ensure they have a long-lasting effect on the audience. Adding to the tension is Colin Stetson's electrifying score, which is undeniably one of the strongest horror soundtracks in years. At the center of it all is an outstanding performance by Toni Collette, who carries the whole film magnificently in what is no doubt a career defining role. Most importantly, it's a film concerned with it's story and characters, and works hard to build upon said characters to ensure we care for them throughout. That's a tricky thing to pull off, especially in horror where schlock and scares and nightmarish imagery can often be placed before character development. And yet here, Aster takes the time to get to know these people, enabling us to really grow invested in their struggles as things go from bad to worse. There's certainly a lot to unravel, particularly between Annie and her stoner/slacker son Peter (Wolff). An onslaught of terror, unsettling twists and turns become the highlight for the unrelenting third act. Never has a horror film struck such a chord with me; never has one so effortlessly crept beneath my skin and made me feel uneasy. Hereditary is a must-see piece of work. Haunting, unsettling, ghastly and downright terrifying. For a debut, Aster has struck gold. One of the finest the horror films in years.",Hereditary

434,sanjidparvez,A distrubingly melancholic mix of the grief & the supernatural,9,22 August 2018,"Quite an unpredictable & unsettling tale of a seemingly dysfunctional family where almost every member become torn apart inside by tragedy after tragedy. And what begins as an emotional roller-coaster about a family tearing apart with grief, eventually descends into madness and the supernatural that demands careful attention to almost every scene & dialog from the very beginning.
In this remarkable debut feature, director Ari Aster keeps a wonderful balance between the elements of mainstream & art-house horror films through an unnerving experience till the end. The film had a lot to say about grief and trauma and the way it was put together & keeps a moving, yet an eerily melancholy tone all over is its strongest part. Particularly that heated arguments between the mother & the son at the dinner table was quite heart-wrenching and one of the most moving segments of the movie, IMO.All four of the main cast shines in their respective roles, the highlight was the Oscar worthy, emotionally moving performance by Toni Collette. Throughout the movie, she expressed a fear of something shifting in her brain, beyond any control, inflecting her world with a terror, dread or uncertainty that she was unable to shape or contain or wake up from. One that just keeps unraveling and commands you to watch.
The two younger actors respectively delivered some strong performances as well where they convincingly embodied the horrific nature of certain moments, while those scenes were disturbingly underscored with a desperate sense of dread & helplessness.Though this should definitely regard as a modern masterpiece of Horror but not sure whether or not it'll become a fan-favorite in coming days for its slow burn nature & thought provoking elements, as nowadays even masterpieces like THE BABADOOK or IT FOLLOWS often gets panned by the genre-fans.",Hereditary
435,Ingrouille181,"Good start up, then it turned into artsy-fartsy nonsense.",6,15 June 2018,"I enjoy coherent storylines, great acting, good jump scares. Not this movie. Hereditary is one of the more interesting haunting movies I've seen in a while. The problem being this film falls into a lot of same tired tropes and cliches those do.""The story focuses on the Graham, where the mom and wife Annie has just lost her mother"". Honestly, the first synopsis said this, but then it also said something along the lines of ""but a series of events will unravel their families deep past and her mothers crimes"": something like that. I'd wanna see that movie, maybe something like the Wrecked film with Adrian Brody, where his amnesia starts to disappear and his crimes are brought to light. Instead we have, mediums and some ghosts. And really, what did the name hereditary have to do with the film anyway; did it just sound cool?Some good things I liked included Toni Collette's performance, which isn't surprising, I've loved her since I saw The Sixth Sense the first time. I even enjoyed Millie Shapiro's performance as the daughter, for the screen time she was given. Other than that, none of the other actors stand out. The film stars Nat Wolff's brother Alex Wolff, and I thought he'd be great in this, but he just wasn't. I think he was miscast in this. None to mention his performance is either underperformed or overacted. Worst thing about his performance in this are all the scenes where he's meant to be crying, and he was straight up acting like he was mocking someone crying, not actually crying, made me laugh.As for all the other stuff I didn't like: the movie felt too long right off the bat. There are scenes that are meant build some kind of intensity and a spooky atmosphere, but it lingers on the shot too long and all the tension disappears. It got annoying at a point.And I won't spoil the ending, but it left me scratching my head down to the bone. I say this a lot, but it legitimately felt like the director thought of it on the spot. Unless there's a sequel coming to explain all this, I'm just completely lost. I recently saw Mother! with Jennifer Lawrence and I could instantly tell it was a metaphor or interpretation of biblical scripture; what was this movies message; if your daughters a weirdo, she'll bring about the anti-christ or something? The ending was getting flashes of Only God Forgives just watching it, it was that artsy-fartsy ""Oh....what does it mean?""Not a film I'm gonna watch again anytime soon.

It's pretty intense at certain parts and really sad surprisingly, making this is pretty good movie on it's own. What about the scary scenes? They legitimately frightened me. Certain scenes I can't even describe because they were really powerful and also pretty damn terrifying. Hereditary (2018) thus personally is a movie you should see on your own. However, there is are some things that were a little distracting and not done so well. The ""Peter"" character is whiny and a lot of the time and passable for a solid 70% of the time. This weird light thing was pretty pointless and could've been redone in a better way with a new idea, and this one scene with the little girl where she sees the dead grandmother in a burning field in broad daylight and no one else noticed around the house. Was this a hallucination? I was pretty confused when I saw that. Despite its flaws, there are lot of really good scene. Such as the scene where the accident at the car happens, the scene where the mom is burning, the explaining and build up to a seriously creepy coven (for reference they stood naked around Peter), the way they used the spirits earlier made me question if this was even real.

442,Clintekabor,"I didn't let her anywhere near me when I had my first, my son, which is why I gave her my daughter",9,15 March 2021,"Hereditary is one of the few films that successfully manages to blend all the right elements together and create everything you really want in a horror film.It is terrifying, suspenseful , and mysterious as it deals with a families ties to the occult with dark, and supernatural themes.I have seen Hereditary twice and my opinion has varied on both occasions. Why? Because It's hard to appreciate the story without giving yourself the proper headspace and environment when watching the film.Horror films should be watched in the dark, with the lights dimmed or off, decent enough surround sound, and an ample sized viewing so you can fully appreciate the right atmosphere.I was on a very long flight browsing through the film library I ultimately was in the mood for a horror flick and, decided to give Hereditary a go after reading up on all the hype. And maybe it was because of the ambience or atmosphere being on a small screen with cheap headphones. On my first viewing I found this film to be very overrated and I felt very let down.Upon the second viewing of Hereditary in my home, I changed my opinion drastically. I felt greater fulfilment, I was feeling just as tense as when I had first seen the film but this time I was more heavily engaged with the story. I found little clues throughout the movie that tied together, and I just throughly enjoyed my experience a whole lot more.Hereditary has you emotionally invested into the family before the grim horrors begin, which adds an additional level of tension to the film.It's not often that a film blends it's expansive story with wonderful character development. But this is a horror film that has builds great excitement, and anticipation. It has a beginning, middle and end which doesn't lag and keeps you heavily engaged in the family drama.The whole cast were phenomenal. I can't individually pick out anyone specifically, although Toni Colette (Annie) was scarily good. And I was quite surprised with the performance of Alex Wolff (Peter). But equally everyone made this film what it is. There was so many deep, heavy performances that would haven taken their toll on even the best performers.I believe this will be looked upon as a classic modern day horror that will set up a platform for others to come after it. Kudus to Ari Aster who could soon find himself as a modern day master in the horror genre, and has created an art that in years time you will want to go back to, and watch again.9/10",Hereditary

444,Milo-Jeeder,This movie really is disturbing beyond belief.,9,30 November 2018,"Every now and then, when a new horror film comes, we get a few reviews from a very exclusive group of people who assisted to a private screening, claiming that said film is the most disturbing thing they have seen in years, with outrageous statements about people who allegedly had to leave the screening because they were too sickened. I don't buy the hype when a new film is arbitrarily deemed as this generation's ""The Exorcist"", ""Rosemary's Baby"" or whatever. As a matter of fact, the way I see it, this hyperbolic publicity usually works in a way that is harmful to the film, because we get really high expectations and that's never a good thing. Well, ""Hereditary"" was one of those films that was advertised as ""too scary and disturbing for words"" or ""people who watched the film went blind afterwards"" and, for once, I can say that I mostly agree with the hype. I have been watching horror films for over two decades and, at this point, I am mostly desensitized. Though gore usually makes my stomach turn, even when it's not that realistic, horror films just don't have that much of an impact on me anymore. I can appreciate a well done horror film for sure, but they simply don't scare me, they don't usually upset me and they certainly don't ""stay"" with me afterwards.In ""Hereditary"", the story centers around the Graham family, composed by Annie, the mother; Steve, the father; Peter, the son and Charlie, the (very peculiar) young daughter. The Grahams find themselves coping with the death of Ellen, Annie's mother, though only young Charlie appears to be mourning her loss, while the rest of the family seem somewhat indifferent to her recent passing. It is no surprise that only Charlie misses Ellen, as it is stated that she was her favorite and it is well established from the beginning that Ellen was extremely secretive and not exactly a very loving woman, not even to her own daughter. As a matter of fact, aside from Charlie, it seems that the Grahams are actually relieved after Ellen's death, especially because during her final days, her dementia had taken its toll on her and she wasn't quite herself anymore. The fact that Ellen had been living with the Grahams during her final years may have contributed to the feeling of well disguised general relieve, since caring for a person who suffers from chronic mental illness can be a burdensome experience, especially if said person was already difficult to begin with.Though grannie Ellen's departure doesn't cause that much of an emotional impact on his close relatives, tragedy ensues and terrible (really terrible) events impact the life of the Grahams. On the verge of insanity, Annie begins to investigate about her mother's life and discovers a lot of horrible secrets about her dark nature. In the end, she will find herself fighting against an evil force that is out to destroy her and her already unstable family.There are many reasons to praise ""Hereditary"" and the first thing that comes to my mind is Toni Collette's acting, which is out of this world. I already knew she was talented, because prior to this, I had seen many films and TV series where she appeared and she never disappointed. After seeing this, I have to say that Toni is the definition of versatile. This woman is capable of expressing emotions in a way that one can easily feel what she feels. The scene where Collette's character finds her dead daughter gave me chills and nightmares (literally, nightmares) and this is coming from someone who is pretty much immunized when it comes to disturbing imagery and situations in films. All the actors in this film are perfect in their roles, but Toni sure steals all the spotlight, mainly due to the fact that her character gets more screen time and the fact that her character deals with the tragedy that surrenders this family in a deeper level.Another great aspect of ""Hereditary"" is the fact that it actually succeeds in making the audience feel something very powerful (and scarring) after one of the character's gruesome and tragic death, which is not very common in horror films, since we are always prepared for the worst. How many deaths really became iconic in horror flicks? Not a lot, the first thing that comes to mind is Gage in ""Pet Sematary"", but I believe that, in time, Charlie's death will become just as iconic. Personally, I was more disturbed by this, because it was completely unexpected. It is very difficult to create a death in a horror movie that doesn't end up being generic and bland, but Ari Aster sure gets the job done here.Another thing to point out is the fact that ""Hereditary"" perfectly manages to fill over two hours without dragging. I admit I can be a little bit reluctant when it comes to watching films that are over 90 minutes sometimes, but Aster manages to give us a slow burn, without giving us a boring final result, filled with pointless sequences that lead to nothing but lack of interest (though many will disagree, since a lot of people complained about how ""boring"" this film is).Horror genre tends to be rather formulaic and offer very repetitive ""in your face"" tropes to set the mood and I'm actually okay with this, because I enjoy a conventional flick as much as the next guy, if it manages to entertain and get the job done. Now, setting the horror mood without the classic elements is a major challange and ""Hereditary"" succeeds in this aspect as well. While the conventional horror elements are heavily displayed during the second half of the film, the atmosphere is so perfectly developed that, from the very beginning, we just know that horror is in the air and we know that the Grahams are going to suffer a great deal, though we don't exactly know why. The whole time, I felt uneasy and the fact that I didn't know what the heck was going on, made it even more disturbing.Though I don't have major complaints concerning the film, there are a bunch of things regarding the plot that just don't quite make sense to me entirely, though I've seen it twice and I paid close attention to all the small details during the second viewing. As if this wasn't enough, I read and watched interviews with the director, Ari Aster, who actually failed to provide solid answers to certain aspects of the plot, which leads me to believe that, in fact, ""Hereditary"" offers a some ambiguity. Since the movie excels in every single aspect, I can overlook a few loose ends, but on the other hand, a movie that lasts more than two hours should be able to provide solid answers to all the interrogatories. One of my major problems, plot-wise, is that Charlie, who was supposedly taken by Paimon during the entire time, doesn't quite act like a demonic entity. As a matter of fact, peculiar as she appears, Charlie pretty much behaves like a little girl throughout most of the film. Are we supposed to assume to Paimon was trying to pass as a little girl to deceive people or Paimon simply didn't take full posession of his hostess, allowing Charlie to be both herself and the evil entity alternatively? While it's not neccesarily a plothole, I find this aspect of the story a little bit ambiguous. Another thing that threw me off is the fact that the siblings look nothing like each other. Well, more precisely, Peter doesn't look like any of the other members of the family. True, Charlie didn't exactly look like his parents either, but at least she didn't look like she belonged to another ethnic group, which is the case of Peter. Alex Wolff, the actor who plays Peter, is of Ashkenazi Jewish, English and German ethnicity, though he appears to be Indian, while the rest of the family looks Caucasian. Now, this wouldn't be a head-scratcher if the character was adopted, but it is clearly stated that Peter is the biological son of Annie and Steve. Again, not necessarily something that ruins the film, but it's certainly distracting to a minimal degree.As a small little piece of trivia (for the lack of a better word), I might add that, intentionally or not, the story borrows a few things from previous horror films that, at the time of their releases, didn't get the same attention or recognition that ""Hereditary"" got around the time of its own release. Specifically, I'm referring to films like ""Darkness"" (2002), ""Paranormal Activity 3"" and the Mexican obscure gem, ""La Tía Alejandra"" (1979). Though I have a positive opinion regarding the previously mentioned films, they are not nearly as powerful or disturbing as ""Hereditary"" and they were mostly conceived to appeal to a wider audience, comercially speaking, at least. In the previously mentioned films, an oblivious family's peace and happiness is shattered by a loved one, more specifically, an ancestor with an evil agenda that involves sacrificing a young child in order to please a dark deity. In the case of ""Hereditary"", the mischievous ancestor only appears as a ghostly figure once and then we see her lying in her coffin, but her presence is actually very powerful throughout the entire film, to the point where her dark nature actually feels oppressive.Though there are a few moments of mild unintended hilarity, I fail to understand those reviews claiming that the entire theater was laughing hysterically during the film. Watching horror films is one of my favorite ways to entertain myself, they hardly ever have that much of an impact on me anymore. They used to cause a bigger impact on me when I was younger, but after watching hundreds of them, they just don't frighten me, which is reasonable. A horror film can be very well done, without necessarily being scary. Well, ""Hereditary"" is a film that managed to stay with me, it disturbed me, I found it dark, unnerving and depressing.",Hereditary
445,avenuesf,I agree with the hype,9,8 June 2018,"I saw this at an advance screening because I'd been hearing so much praise about it and how frightening it was. It was somewhat reminiscent of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and for three or four days after I saw it little plot details finally slid into place in my head and it made the film even more disturbing. I think in order to really ""get"" this film it would mean going back and seeing it a second time.There are some truly horrifying scenes in ""Hereditary,"" and it progresses from a story about family grief into a manic nightmare; it also takes on a grim, almost depressing tone sometimes in its exploration of mental illness and dysfunctional family dynamics. There's a feeling of dread throughout the film that's hard to shake, very much like ""The Babadook."" Toni Collette again proves she's one of finest actresses around today and her performance in this is an incredible tour de force that should be taken seriously when awards season comes around. She's truly an amazing presence in this film, and some of her scenes are so emotionally charged that you can see her expressing one emotion on top of another. All the performances are excellent (especially Ann Dowd and Alex Wolff), but it's Collette that carries the film to it's finale.Basically the message of the film seems to be when you grow up with a monster of a mother, the experience stays with you the rest of your life. Ari Aster's filmography seems to highlight family and mother-son themes, and it'll be interesting to see where he goes after ""Hereditary."" It's a brave attempt to create an intelligent, unique horror film, and for that alone I really enjoyed it.",Hereditary

449,pedroquintaoo,"First I hated, then I loved it",7,18 June 2018,"I've seen Hereditary with low expectations because I knew it was from the same producers of The Witch and Spring Breakers (two movies I hated).
Is a slow burn movie, the viewer should be with the right mood to appreciate it. The cast is great (Toni Collette deserves an Oscar, her interpretation is one of the best I've seen ), the cinematography is good and the plot is interesting.The fact why a lot of people hated was all fault of the marketing, the trailers showed a film with a different vibe directed to the main audiences. For example: I watched with my brother, he was expecting something like The Conjuring or Orphan. But I said to him to don't create high expectations because he was going to see something really different.To be honest, I didn't like Hereditary so much when I left from the theater, I needed to think a lot about what I watched, because there were some shocking, disturbing and disgusting scenes that made me a little uncomfortable. But that is what cinema does, I mean, create emotions on us. Now, I can say, I really liked this movie even if it can be a little boring sometimes.
So, for me Hereditary is a masterpiece, has a good dark story to tell, the things start to get darker during the 2nd act and then there's a lot of intense and terrifying scenes until the weak climax. Yes, I did not like the ending, is a bit stupid and cliché, the director is awesome but he could do a better ending.It's a post-modern classic, I took some time to think about everything I watched, is shocking and really dark, I only would change the ending and add some jump scares just to put the mainstream audience happy.Rating: 7.5/10",Hereditary
450,mc1382,Just might be one of the best films I have ever seen,8,24 June 2018,"Now I know that's a big statement and honestly I'm not one of those people who likes to throw a statement like that at every good film I see. But my god, I have never seen a film balance exposition and ambiguity so masterfully. It doesn't spoon feed you anything but it doesn't leave you in the dark either. On my first viewing I thought it was a solid horror film that was refreshing in the genre but on my second viewing once I pieced together all the elements I realised that this film has so many layers especially in the characterisation department. Once I knew what happened in the ending it made the movie as a whole a lot stronger and I realised that the film gives you subtle hints without them being forced down your throat. This in turn made the first half and second half more connected for me. This film just doesn't let up for it's entire runtime and delivers so much tension. Toni Collette and Alex Wolff amaze as if this is the last performance they ever get to do. Their presence commanded the screen so well that I was thoroughly immersed in the world of this film. Great performances from the rest of the cast as well. The cinematography is stunning and is in a class of its own. Some of these shots are like eye candy and compliment the film perfectly. The music is a cacophony of ambience and melodic creepiness just makes the film become a spiritual but terrifying experience.The thing this film does so well is mixing horror elements with human elements. This makes the film both horrific and relatable at the same time. With a character like Peter you feel everything he feels. This makes it even more painful when his whole family due to the cult turns against him. Seeing him reverting back to a childlike state at certain points just really resonated with me. Seeing his life at home, school, the party really sells him as being vulnerable. The fact that he is the host for Paimon and never gets to tell his parents, his friends and Bridget how he really felt about who he is as a person and Charlie's death is just truly heartbreaking. This is how you write a teen character.The film is so realistic while being out of this world. This just makes me relate to this film so much more. Ari Aster in his debut has somehow manged to understand what makes a good horror film better than a lot of his contemporaries. Truly a refreshing film in the wasteland that is horror. No film is perfect but I'm giving this a 10 based on the emotional connection I had with it. Truly a shocking, sad, complex masterpiece.",Hereditary
451,fatfil-414-451797,Over hyped and frustrating,5,9 December 2018,"There was a lot of hype around this movie, and I was very much looking forward to watching it. I did enjoy it, it is a slow burner, which is fine, but there is so much that is left unexplained I found it frustrating. The mother seems to make a living building model houses, and has some deadline coming up, but this is never expanded on. The daughter is great in this, very off kilter and suitably odd. I maybe a bit thick, but it almost seems like the writers changed their minds about where the story was going half way through. It appeared to be going down a haunting, possession path, then in the last section blindsides you with the black magic thread. I am still wondering if the daughters death so early in the movie had anything at all to do with the story line, apart from the fact they could then seance her. And the ending looked like they had driven into a cul-de-sac and had nowhere to go.",Hereditary

The characters need to be built up more in the beginning so we understand what they are about. For example, how would anyone know that Gabriel Byrne used to be Toni Collette's therapist? The story behind the family need to be worked on a little better to not leave viewers a little confused and disinterested. Maybe the editing could have been improved. There was little hints here and there that I picked watching Toni's speech during her mother's funeral but not sufficient and can get easily missed. I understand that they may not want to give the viewers the plot til the end so they keep watching but by the time the movie ends, some questions weren't really answered or clarified. I had to google the full story of the movie myself to find out and understand some things. The movie doesn't even get interesting until something happens to Milly Shapiro. The ending seems rushed.

Don't watch if you're easily scared and don't like the dark corner of your bedroom! Gory scene near the beginning which is REALLY scary! Toni Collette is superb and her performance is rather scary too. I don't mean in a cynical way. She's brilliant. Oscar standard. Gabriel Byrne is ok too. The movie is about bereavement, ghosts, and a demon and his worshipers. I think it's the best supernatural movie I've seen in fact.",Hereditary
458,vuileharry,Overhyped for Pretentiousness,4,24 June 2019,"If you just look at the story it's just a story. Some people are trying to help their favorite demon to ressurect into a useable host and in the end they succeed.That's it. It's actually a really simple given and it's just fine for 'horror'. And of course there's a million ways to go about telling it.Now how would you go about tricking people into thinking your movie is really 'highbrow' and 'special'?Just make your movie needlessly long with lots of boring long-ass shots and above all needlessly 'mysterious', by giving out the information in an almost ungraspable way, so you just have to watch it 3 times or go read on internet before you can understand this basicly pretty simple story. That's how.Thats really all that makes this movie seem so genious to some: they make a puzzle out of it. But if you strip the story down to it's bare bones (after you finally got it of course), there is absolutely nothing so special about it. It's just a pretty average, standard story, only told like a complicated puzzle. That's all.There's more movies like this that get overhyped by some for this very same reason. Well, not for me. I really don't think this movie is so brilliant. Or scary.

459,Scarefish,Hereditary is Fairly Scary,8,17 June 2018,"Just going to open with this: This film is 14A in British Columbia, which unfortunately means the showings are full of obnoxious teenagers who think clucking constantly is funniest thing in the world, and that really does ruin the movie-going experience in a big way. However, I still felt this was a great film, even if it doesn't hit with those with the same IQ as their age who are brainwashed into adoring trashy jumpscare-riddled garbage.I was told this film is not scary, but is seriously &$@^ed up, but as soon as I saw the apparition early off in the film, I was concerned. One of my biggest fears is hallucination, so the subject matter and creepy happenings throughout the film were very effective. I was also impressed to find there were only two minor jumpscares in the film, though there were several auditory scares, which is the only bit in modern horror that I have trouble enjoying a film through. It's quite odd that when this film decides a moment is particularly creepy, an act as simple as flicking a lightswitch is amplified to 60 decibels. This only occurred several times anyways, so it was hardly an insurmountable feat.The film feels more like a drama than a horror film, even as far as classic horror movies go. I feel like the dramatic elements are the strongest aspect of the film, but that they would be simply too devastating to have in a plain drama film. It feels different, but it works, and the added creepy atmosphere fits perfectly with the traumatic material, though I wish they stuck with the drama through til the end.The acting ranged from awful to excellent. Most of the actors do a fantastic job, aside from the teenage boy played by Alex Wolff, who was hit-or-miss. This guy can emote excellently despite having a derpy face, up until he opens his mouth and attempts to deliver his lines. His dialogue isn't written well, which adds to this, as he screams and cries ""mommy"" despite being an angsty teenager. He pulls off depressed, shocked, and angry perfectly fine, but as soon as he attempts sad, the results are immersion-breakingly awful. There's a scene where he attempts to cry, and it sounds like he's mocking crying, almost like he's intentionally throwing the scene and they just kept it.There were a lot of moments in which there were creepy elements subtly hiding in the background of prolonged shots, which tends to unfortunately appear in otherwise terrible horror films such as The Mothman Prophecies and The Strangers. I'm glad to see this technique properly realized and executed in this film. I wasn't bored despite the many scenes that had ultimately very little density to them, as the suspense was there, and there was enough confusion in the film to which there were several directions it could go at any point.The cinematography was very good, and certainly better than The Witch in that regard. This film is nearly as disturbing, but also much less painful on the eyes, styling it up with actual modern editing techniques, most notably color correction to make the scenes pop.The CGI effects are pretty good and interesting for the most part, up until the bugs and flies show up. The weird effects are interesting, and add to the bizarre nightmare-like air to the second act of the film. The flies are absurdly bad, and simply look like black smears whizzing around in circles through rooms. They look like basic animation loops placed incorrectly given the shots that were filmed.I also felt the ending to be a bit weak in comparison to the rest of the film. I was interested to see where the film's story was heading throughout the first two acts, and I was a bit disappointed with the conclusion. It was as goofy as it was disturbing whereas the rest of the film was just very disturbing.The film also does feel like it drags a bit towards the end, but not by much. I could imagine others might find it to be perfect, and others to find it mind-numbingly long, but I feel it's fine.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this film, but be prepared for obnoxious morons to attempt to break the immersion.",Hereditary

Having seen so much already i might look for other things than i used to, i don't know.
I don't get scared anymore, i think that is beyond me by now, but i still love a well crafted movie and here is what i think this one did so well:1. The storytelling - It is, for once, really well done and thought through. There is hardly any feeling of ""why do they do that"" or ""why do they act in that way in that situation"". It all fits together quite well.
It is first of all a very gripping emotional tale about how a family of individuals cope with heartbreaking events.2. The acting - On top of the above the acting is top notch. I always enjoy watching Toni Collette. I think she is a great actress. Gabriel Byrne does a really great job as the father desperately trying to keep things together and i was for the most part very impressed with the young Alex Wolff. He does a very emotional performance that can't have been easy.3. The filming and pace of the movie - For me the movie is almost perfectly shot and the slow pace fits it perfectly. Every important scene takes the time that is needed to really make you see and feel everything, right to the bone. It never gets pretentious or boring, it just works.The only thing for me that was maybe a bit of... compared to the rest, is the ending.

Toni Colette gives us her best performance, which is really the be all and end all of the film, as, whilst the other actors are good, she devours the screen and then spits it out in a nuanced, devastating explosion of emotions, both restrained and unfettered.

A score of 87 from the critics? Will never again rent or buy a movie based on critic reviews. What a shame because Toni Collett is such a great actress.

But this schlock horror Rosemary's Baby rip-off at the end was just way silly - and the added gore and special effects did not help. What a dreary, unpleasant waste of time. Are critics getting dumber? The opening shot was cool, if only I had stopped there.",Hereditary
473,drifter_74,"The definition of ""horror"" must have changed while I wasn't looking",3,26 August 2018,The first three quarters of this slow burner is a family drama about death in the family. The grandmother of a slightly odd family passes away. From conversations it becomes clear that she was not well liked and that her daughter attempted to keep the grandchildren away from her. We also learn that her son committed suicide at a relatively young age. All this paints a picture of a troubled family. The movie really only finds direction when an accident claims the life of the thirteen year old granddaughter and things slowly start to unravel from there. The horror elements only make an entry about twenty minutes before the end. Solid acting from the entire cast and broody settings together with lots of camera zooming and panning is not enough to save the film.,Hereditary
474,jchano123,"Pretty average family drama, has one redeeming scene though",5,10 June 2018,"First off, there was an 8 year old girl in the theatre with her family when I went to see this, what are you people thinking?Anyways,
The film had one really good scary moment, but by the end I didn't totally understand the narrative and had to keep looking up explanations to understand exactly what happened.
Still, my question is- why did the cult need to put Charlie's spirit inside of Peter? Wasn't the whole point to get Paimon a male host? Why keep Charlie? Also, why is it that none of the characters call the police during any of this? 
The one scene that did really get to me was the decapitation scene - how the characters reacted to it and how the director chose to reveal it. I don't remember another time I've felt that much adrenaline rush through me when watching a movie. However, the rest of the film felt pretty slow and eventless, and at some points boring.
The first scene at the grief recovery group was pretty bad. Collette's character gives a total exposition dump of 'here's everything you need to know about my character to watch the rest of the film'. As well acted as it was, the movie felt like it came to a grinding halt for this, which was a major flaw in the writing. 
I really couldn't take Alex Wolff seriously in this. He just seemed like just another douchey frat bro. A shame that most of the film hinges on his character and performance. He was fine in Patriots Day, but that might've been because I didn't realize it was him.
However, there were a few scenes where the actors did create good tension when they didn't have any dialogue, mainly the dinner scenes.Also, at the very end when the Mom was floating up the ladder to the treehouse, I couldn't help but laugh, it was so unintentionally funny to me.",Hereditary
475,ToxicJug,Scariest Modern Horror film,7,24 May 2021,"Hereditary is a dark film about grief and loss and director Ari Asters Realistic style along with the incredible performances of the cast ensures that you experience that grief along with our characters throughout the films runtime. Hereditary wants you to feel uneasy or even sick and it succeeds in that department in multiple ways! Take some of the most disturbing imagery I have ever seen put to film combined with performances that make you forget that your watching a movie and you get Hereditary. The movie does drag a bit through the middle but other than that it does what it wants to do. It scares you, it disturbs you, and it even shocks you. Make sure to check this one out with the lights on!",Hereditary
476,JoeYabuki,A really well shot movie,7,8 June 2018,"The cinematography is exquisite; well directed; great performances of all the actors; really disturbing, crude, and teerifying. The film is pretty slow but not bad, it's a good plot and you are constantly mute staring the screen waiting for things to come and trying to figure out what is going on. Altough however the third act is terrible, it decays miserably at the end; some visual FX are poor (like the fire); it isn't the new ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shinning"" or ""Psycho"". Highly recommended if you like movies and horror.",Hereditary

The movie is at least 15 minutes too long and the character of Annie became REALLY annoying. Also it just looks plain stupid at the end. OK, they are Devil worshippers but I kept wondering how people with no head could worship? How did a white couple have what looked like a half cast son? Why the hell was Annie crawling about like a spider. Why did burning the book set Steve on fire?To sum up, a good start but a weak final third of the movie.",Hereditary
482,afrodome,Nightmares Brought to the Big Screen.,10,21 June 2018,"I came into the theater with high hopes that what I was about to witness would be a horror classic; a movie that is cutting edge, skin crawling, visceral, cerebral, electrifying, and to some degree traumatizing. I wanted a film that I could liken to classics such as The Exorcist, Alien, The Thing, The Descent, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Psycho. To my delight, I was not only impressed, I was in a state of disbelief. Once the credits started rolling and Both Sides Now by Judy Collins starts playing (kudos Ari Aster) I was 'shooketh'. ""What did I just watch?"" I thought to myself. Now mind you, I wasn't particularly scared at all when the movie was over, but I think it went beyond being scared, thrilled. I was symptomatic of being sick: migraine, nausea, sweating, the chills.. it felt like I had the flu! However, it wasn't a flu, just the sheer intensity of this movie made me feel like I was running a temperature.  Onto the things I liked about this movie: DETAIL - I really, really enjoy Ari's approach to filmmaking. He's both humble in the way he presents himself and the work he does, and with his work, he puts his ALL into every element, shot, theme, color, camera movement, lighting; when watching Hereditary you can just see talent oozing from every shot of the film. One might require a second viewing, but when looking back on the film, you can see that this family is visually evident of being doomed from the get-go. You can see cult members lingering in the background as far back as the beginning (I didn't notice at first but when researching I got chills down my spine).Unexpected Horror - Midway, we see Peter getting an invite for a house party. The way this scene is built up is so incredibly tense, so gripping, that I nearly covered my eyes. Annie makes Peter bring his sister to this party as a means to give him an ultimatum on being responsible. Unfortunately, it backfires on everybody in the worst possible way. Charlie ends up eating chocolate cake that had walnuts while Peter is smoking pot with his buddies. We see poor Charlie in the corner breathing with the sound of constriction. Peter rushes her in the car and starts bolting down a dark desolate road at 80 miles an hour with Charlie gasping for air, kicking violently in the back (kudos Milly Shapiro for the electrifying performance). A dead dear is in then middle of the road, Peter swerves to dodge the carcass, and Charlie rolls down the window in an attempt to get more airflow, and then the unthinkable happens. Charlie hits her head on a telephone pole in a car going 80 miles an hour. Peter, in a state of shock, stops the car and can't even scream, turn around, nothing. His eyes watery, hands shaking, he pulls away, makes it home, and goes upstairs. The following morning, the camera remains on Peter's face with the faint sound of his mother going downstairs. What would follow was probably the most haunting, heartbreaking, ice cold experience I've ever witnessed in a movie. Annie's screams of absolute horror discovering her own child followed by a shot of the road where Charlie's head is, panning back to Annie's cries and pleas of wanting to die will be remembered as one of the most horrific scenes in cinema history.Realism -One of the most notable aspects of the movie is that there are no heroes. We have a mother, on the brink of a complete meltdown, harboring guilt and despair trying to navigate through life, barely hanging on. Peter is reduced to a scared child, screaming ""MOMMY"" unable to keep it together anymore. Lastly, there's Steve. A father that cares for his family, but has no idea what the hell is happening around him. You can see his feelings of horrendous discomfort, but he has no outlet; he's the one that is supposed to keep everything as ""OK"" as the universe will allow. This is the portrait of a regular family. When tragedy strikes, the grief is shared, and there are no heroes to turn to in a time of domestic crisis. The Music - Haunting, brooding, EVIL, thunderous, dread-soaked, and all done with a saxophone (odd but unique sound). Amazing job done by Colin Stetson.Supernatural Ending - I can understand why some do not like the ending. Some might say that the mental illness theme could have been utilized and the film would be more effective, and I would have to disagree. This film is a nightmare in that what people may think is mental sickness giving them a skewed view on the world, is actually a hellish force conducting their every move; premeditated and motivated by the forces of evil. The treehouse,..my God, the treehouse, was just dripping with pure evil. We have a statue with Charlie's decapitated head, corpses bent to appear like they are bowing before it, the chants of ""HAIL PAIMON!"" the naked people in the woods, creepy and unsettling to the point where you almost have to laugh. In summary, I LOVED HEREDITARY and I believe it will go down in history as one of the greatest horror films ever made.",Hereditary

For a horror, this film has everything; deeply disturbing moments, jump scares, genuine times of frights, floods of anticipation, a great storyline and leaves you constantly gripped to your seat. It really is a film that can bring shivers out from your spine. There are not many horror's that I can say truly get me fully enticed, however this is definitely one. I have already seen it twice and will watch it again in the near future for sure. Hereditary has a brilliant balance to it and is not scared to go where others wouldn't.

If you are into more modern horrors such as ""The Mist,"" ""The Conjuring,"" and ""Insideous 3,"" you are also speaking my tongue. Hereditary is a movie that can not be regarded as anything close to the movies named. It's a ride with misleading suspense; You're constantly waiting for something interesting and unique to transpire but these are few and far between. For a slow paced movie, it's difficult to connect with the characters and quite frankly you just do not care to. I would say skip this one unless you have a movie pass.",Hereditary
487,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,"A deep, twisted experience to dissect and go insane over",9,12 June 2018,"Hereditary is a slow-burn descent into madness and hell all weaved around the structure of this dark family drama. It begins with the funeral of Anne Graham's estranged mother Ellen. And the word ""estranged"" is a light way to describe the relationship between Anne and Ellen. Due to mental illness being a common trait in Anne's family history, Anne continually felt her mother trying to control her life. It even led to the point where had Anne had to keep Ellen away from her first-born son Peter. Eventually Anne ""gave"" her second child and daughter, Charlie, to Ellen when she was living in her house before her death. Hereditary does have haunted houses and demonic possession elements but the draw of this masterpiece is seeing how this seemingly ordinary sane family discovers the horrifying reality they are in.Ari Aster shows superb amount of craft for a horror story that could have been handled ok or mediocrely. Aster never lets the horror be something that is front and centre. He shows very little jump-scares and relies on very little explanation of the supernatural until the third act. While the horror is lurking off-screen which makes it even more effective, the attention is made towards the dysfunctional relationship within the Graham family. By exploring the idea of family-based mental illnesses, Aster makes us question if this family truly has control over their horrible choices or if they have inherited something that denies them choice at all. As the film goes deeper into the mentality of the Graham's, psychosis and supernatural blur to challenge what is real or not. When supernatural horror kicks in, you already start to feel your sanity slipping away.If Hereditary deserves any recognition other then Ari Aster's skills as a talented filmmaker, it's Toni Collette's Oscar-deserving performance as Anne. Collette creates an emotionally complex character from her performance. Collette can go from showing complete denial to breaking down into complete despair after discovering something horrible. And then she will lash out with the fury of hell in a particular dinner scene that will not be forgotten. Once you see Anne's psyche break, Collette convinces you her turn from being a sceptic to suddenly believing in the supernatural thanks to the desperation she expresses on her face.The build-up of the tension is helped by Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography. The film now and then shows Anne making life-like miniature replicas of her house. Every room in her artwork matches to detail the real-life house. And thanks to the way Pogorzelski frames the camera, the negative space makes you feel like the characters are unknowingly living inside one of these miniatures. The camera's perspective makes feel like some higher power is watching their behaviour like someone looking at fish inside an aquarium.Hereditary won't be for those expecting a quick scare for entertainment sake. Hereditary fits more in the mold of A24's other artistic horror films like The Witch and It Comes At Night. It's a deep psychological analysis of a family loosing their minds with otherworldly forces playing a part. Hereditary is very unique creepy experience that is worth dissecting once you have seen the film.",Hereditary

There are still one or two things not 100% clear, but overall not a bad film. I've seen many worse horrors, this one weren't too predictable and the acting was good; the film puts an emphasis on realism and emotions displayed among a fractured or troubled family.Only downsides really, are the slow build up which may deter some.

Which would've been fine had I known I was going to spend the majority of the film watching a family drama. Then out of no where the last 15 minutes turns into the exorcist. The main characters, the graham family is almost completely irrelevant because there is a big bad manipulating them... i guess? But we never see who these people are... we don't know why they're doing what they're doing. It just happens and you go... okay... so there's a group of people that want to bring a demon into the world. okie doke. We have no idea why the grandmother would do all the things she's done... literally no clue. No backstory... nothing. The grandmothers relationship to Ann Dowd's priestess character... totally skimmed over. Seriously... Toni Collette literally skims over it in a picture book.I gave this 5 points for the performances alone. Toni Collette was a force. The dinner table scene gave me goosebumps. The film as a whole felt like one huge lead up to nothing...unless there is a sequel. But with A24 and their artsy bulls*** I doubt we'll get one and I'm not sure I'd pay for it anyway.If you have a wifi bill or maybe a couple groceries you need to get...save your money on this one and go get what you need.

I end up being disappointed or feel like I've been cheated, or can't possibly understand how anyone liked it. But I truly think Hereditary is a great movie that's chilling, intense, and full of surprises.The trailers don't give anything away and it's so important for a movie like this to be watched without knowing what's going to happen. Within the first half hour my jaw dropped and from there I had no idea what to expect. The film consistently had me asking what was going to happen. There were times where I was like, ""Really? This is happening now?"" but I reserved judgement and decided to openly accept wherever this movie went.By the end, as with most horror movie endings, I felt like things went a little too bonkers for me, and I can see why some people would be disappointed. But I still think it was great if you have an open mind.This is a melodrama, so don't expect too much character development here. Toni Collette deserves an award for her performance, though. She is superbly talented. The rest of the cast was fantastic too.I don't typically watch horror movies because I get scared so easily but I felt like this is my kind of horror. No jump scares, just truly disturbing psychological horror, where I didn't feel totally confused at the end. It still had moments where I had to look away out of fear/dread.

502,carlo_simone18,Disturbing rather than scary,9,27 June 2018,"Considering this is Ari Aster's first feature film I feel he has done a remarkable job with 'Hereditary'. This comes across particularly in the actual filmmaking as the direction, cinematography and sound design are all superb in creating an atmosphere of dread pretty much throughout the entirety of the runtime. Special mention must also be made for the lighting which is crafted so exquisitely to create some beautiful shots.In terms of performances Toni Collette is outstanding, as she has so many different aspects of her character to explore, but manages to pull it off. This is complimented by some decent performances from Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro as her children. However, what I most appreciate about this film is the subtle narrative seeds that are sown at the beginning and how that leads into the psychological horror that is prioritised by Aster. It all comes together in a story about a family that is ravaged by tragedy and how they cope with that. The approach to the psychological horror is also exemplary, as in certain shots there are objects/people that you can barely just see, making you wonder if there is anything there at all, which contributes to the disturbing atmosphere.Whilst I can understand why some people hate this film, due to its slow pace and lack of traditional scares, it's not something I personally had an issue with. I have a minor gripe as around the midpoint of the narrative I found myself to be somewhat disengaged in the plot developments, but I was soon drawn back in. Overall, this was an intriguing horror film that I will be revisiting.",Hereditary
503,alucardvenom,I am worried about the state of horror...,3,16 August 2018,"As a long time horror fan I am worried about the state of horror if ""Hereditary"" is considered to be ""one of the best horror movies in XZY decades"".I am not too hard to please when it comes to horror movies, I enjoy bad horror movies equally as great ones, and when I finally got a chance to see Hereditary I went to see it with an open mind.Movie started well with some really nice scene transition so I had my hopes up. ""These people know what they are doing"" I thought to myself. Turns out, while production looked really nice, with few well directed scenes, screenplay and pace were horrible. We are treated with family drama for about 3/4 of the movie with last half an hour being mash of horror scenes. This could work if pace was better and we didn't have to watch long monologues by a lead actress. She did her part well and she literally carries the entire movie, but after second 10 minutes long monologue where I see nothing but her face, my tolerance for her and her character has dropped significantly. Once the horror actually starts, it does get from bad to worse, but as someone who has watched dozens of horror movies I could easily spot ""homages"" (or if you want to call them ripoffs) of scenes from plenty of other horror movies, mainly Conjuring, Exorcist 3 and The Sentinel. Ending is really messy and looks like it was made on spot. It wants to be intelligent, but once you break down the scene you'll realize that someone watched The Conjuring on Monday, Exorcist 3 on Thursday, and watched The Sentinel on Wednesday.Another problem is pace. Some scenes just drag on and on without real reason. I understand that director wanted to establish some atmosphere, however he isn't good at staging suspense so lot of scenes just drag on. Add in that some of those scenes don't really have strong payoff and you get long badly paced scenes with no real plot progression. Some characters just show up and wonder off the movie. I nearly forgot that one such character is even in the movie until he showed up to be cannon fodder. It was supposed to be emotional and horrifying but since we know so little about him it becomes a bad joke. I really don't know how anyone could by into hype. Did bunch of people just said ""It's great!"" without even seeing it, or bars for horror are so low these days that we consider cinematic mess like Hereditary and Insidious to be called ""greatest of XYZ""?",Hereditary

While I wasn't sure about Alex Wolff's portrayal of his character in the first act of the movie, his performance really grew on me as the story went on. From a technical standpoint, HEREDITARY is simply flawless as well.With that said, the main story of the film didn't turn out as intriguing as I wanted it to be. It ultimately doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before. Aster obviously was very inspired by ROSEMARY'S BABY - that's all I'm gonna say here.HEREDITARY is still the best horror film of 2018 for me.

Better those things than predictable slashings and special effect blood letting for gores sake.

Sadly, the film is a little too slow burn for that.Generally, I would say by far the strongest element of the movie is the cast that is all very worthy of awards for their acting - in particular the standout Toni Collette as Annie, who has to give a vastly layered performance of grief without ever becoming monotonous, which she does do in spades and is impressive in both her power and her brokenness. Also great is Gabriel Byrne as the cynical and realist Steve, who loves his family and his wife especially, but is also in a position where he's not able to give Annie what she wants, and this ultimately costs him. Alex Wolff does give a very solid performance in a character role that we've never seen from him before, but I do think that whilst he is exceptionally good in this film as Peter grieving over his sisters' death, I think he gave a better performance in My Friend Dahmer, but that could do with the fact that character was a bit more intelligent than here, where he is, to be honest, an imbecile in places. Most exceptional is young MIlly Shaprio as Charlie, who's not in the film long before her death that's the catalyst for the action, but really gives her some recognisable tics and mannerisms that stick with you after she leaves, and that when they return do give the horror some grounding. And then there's Ann Dowd as the film's overarching antagonist Joan, politely and sweetly being a friend to Annie in her suffering, but really planning the whole thing. In anything is certain, this is an Oscar worthy cast.Feature debut director Ari Asher does break horror clichés for the most part, avoiding jump scares in favour of slow-burn, emotionally brutal horror, very well lit and very well written. It makes use of mental manifestations, processions and more, to make us frightened on a deeper level.However, this is where my issues with the film come to light.
Now, it's nothing new for me to have my opinion adjusted of a movie by it's ending - it's what took me from being apathetic about Me Before You to absolutely hating it, and what took me from being mad at Memento to loving it. Endings can make or break a film. This one breaks it.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't ruin the movie, but it does become the point that Asher ends up falling INTO the cliches' rather than cleverly avoiding them. It all starts to go downhill when Steve dies and Annie becomes possessed. Having already been explained that a male host is needed for the villain to succeed, and being left with a moronic 17 year old who just does dumb things pretty much always, all tension is lost because we know he's screwed. Surely enough, instead of running out his front door, he goes to the attic, and jumps out of the top window. He then becomes possessed by the demon and all is lost.There's also significant decisions made that really cost the film tonally here - first is the decision to have a headless corpse levitate up a ladder instead of moving on its own which would've bee far more effective, there's the musical score that went from being dark and sinister to being overly upbeat, there's the clichéd death-of-family-pet which, as a pet owner, I hate, see no point in, and does NOTHING TO FURTHER ANYTHING, also an over abudance of older naked people that do nothing to add to the mood but detract from it, and then finally some confusing speech at the end. Roll credits.Here's the thing - I do still really rate this movie. There's a lot in it to defend, but there's also things you can't defend, which is a shame. Certainly, with a film like this, you need to see it and form your own opinion. So please, go do so.",Hereditary
507,toutouguy,Stunned,9,31 January 2019,Shockingly pretty good. How good? In everybody's top 15 horror movies of all time good. If you want real horror and twists this movie is for you! Very disturbing film in the best way possible.,Hereditary
508,mikedegroot,I am shocked at the bad reviews here,8,27 August 2018,"Seriously. What the heck is up with all the negativity here for this film? I honestly think people have been forced fed way too many of these crappy jump scare horror movies, that they don't even know what a good one looks like when they watch it. Movies where the story serves only to set up the ""BOO!"" and then continues to the next one. This film has depth, originality, quality acting, a solid story, and some truly unsettling moments and atmosphere. It is not perfect. It has some slower moments and it is long but those are really no reasons to write this one of. I enjoyed the ending and there were plenty of clues and foreshadowing for it all to make sense if you actually pay attention to what's happening. It's not the kind of movie that you can just watch in the background and expect to get a good thrill from. It doesn't jump at you; it creeps up on you and claws it's way in. I guess it's not for everybody but if you like horror movies that make you think you'll probably enjoy this one.",Hereditary
509,Floki_Thorfinn,Ugh... another artsy horror movie flop,1,9 June 2018,"The problem with this kind of films is that they try to take horror to another level, without realizing that instead of improving the genre, they're actually degrading it.I know that the script isn't the strongest element in an horror film, but if the writers are going to develop it as a crucial one, they have to make sure to don't leave loose ends, as happens on Hereditary. It begins to oberwhelm you in a complex history as the movie makes entrance to a fatal third act.But the script isn't the worst of it all. This slow-paced suspense-less movie takes you on a journey of scenes full of tease. When something is going to happen (or you think that something is going to happen)... boom! The scene ends right there.Another thing I really hated was the atmosphere, I mean, almost all of the scenes have a faint but visible light on the background, ¿hello? ¡You're making a freakin' horror movie here!In regards of the performances, I guess they're aceptable... in a quarter of the movie. Toni Collette has a really strong acting in one particular scene in the dinning room, but almost all of the cast's performances are way too over-acted, more like an unintended comedy than a drama or a frightened human. Specially Alex Wolff, who's performance is pathetic in all ways possible. I guess Milly Shapiro's performance and character is the best of the movie, but not good enough to save the whole ship. The finest part of the film involves her, which I'll skip that info to avoid spoilers.Sometimes I hate one of my many rules regarding to the movies world, which is that once I start watching a film, I must get to see it through the end, no matter how bad it is. I wish I have had walk out the cinema amidst the projection.Would I recomend this movie? Absolutely no. Would it worth to give it one chance? If you hated the similar filmmaked ""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"" directed by Robert Eggers, avoid it at all cost. Don't waste your time and money, trust me, is the same boring pretentious hipster horror film. But on the other hand, if you enjoyed the latest, or that kind of unorthodox horror movies, yeah, give it a shot, you'll probably love it and praise it as the credits begin to roll in the deep black rectangle.",Hereditary
510,maindraaritomo,Best horror film I don't want to see again.,9,3 July 2018,"Not a new idea. We can compare the main plot to for example; The Omen, The Vatican Tapes, etc, even Paranormal Activity leads to all about ""the chosen one"". But they have packed this in a very complex way. For over 2 hours I kept questioning how it will end, and it answered the way I expected. Definitely I don't want to see it again as my curiosity concluded.Somehow the jumping scenes quite remind me to typical Korean horrors. It is brilliant. It succeeded in making me feel discomfort.I also see the sequel agenda, I suggest to keep everyone in team on board so the new script would be 100% connected.Ari Aster, Toni Collette and Alex Wolff, well done!",Hereditary
511,Q-Man,"Interesting, kept me guessing",7,27 October 2020,"This film kept me guessing throughout as to where it was headed. Also, we're the things that happened real or delusions? In that respect it was quite interesting. The acting was excellent. Tony Collette got some well deserved praise, but the standout performance for me was Alex Wolfe who seamlessly ran through a range of emotions from confused, angry, vulnerable and sad.
The pacing was oddly slow. I realize that was probably to build tension, but it made the movie overly long. Some scenes were very drawn out. On the whole, it was interesting as a character study. As far as tone, I found it to be more creepy than frightening. It is worth watch.",Hereditary
512,onexmillion,Slow Burner but Enjoyable if Prepared,7,24 August 2018,"I liked Hereditary for what it was. It's a bit 'arty' - the cinematography is great, exceptional in places. Acting is very good. The story is a bit of a slow burner, so if you listened to the hype of it being one of the most scary horrors made, you might be disappointed.Having said that, it is a different type of horror to the norm. It attempts to suck you in slowly with sweeping cameras and a slow but unrelenting tensity, aided by a subtle but menacing soundtrack. I liked that, it was different but for some, they might find it boring.It doesn't rely on your traditional jumps and sudden rise in audio that many other horrors do. If you want that, you'll probably not like this film too much.With that in mind, give it a go. Let it take you in and on its journey. It'll not be a particularly fast one, but it'll be different.",Hereditary

Overly long but still worth a watch but - and this seems weird - is actually suggest reading some spoilers about the story (which I won't put in this review) BEFORE or DURING the film to help you understand what's going on, as I think you'd enjoy it more. You could always just rewatch it but I honestly very much doubt you would bother if you don't get some of it the first time. Some excellent scenes and just enough mainstream horror to override the art house nonsense. I give it a solid 6 for that reason.",Hereditary

516,snopes-881-42844,Nonsense that goes nowhere,3,10 May 2020,"Several random scary things happen, but with no reason or logic. The movie sets the atmosphere well, and has some interesting thematic possibilities, but the latter are never realized. For example, the use of miniatures isn't developed as it could have been. And the witch theme could have been developed to some moral purpose.
Is this movie a psy-op to defuse concern about actual occult practices ?
What exactly is hereditary ? Grandma is a witch, but that power is not passed down ; instead, she curses her own grand-daughter, I guess, though it's not clear how she accomplished that, and it turns out to be a mistake.
Why does burning the notebook cause the mother to burn ? What is so important about it ? The demon doesn't seem to need it or care about it. Then, later, why does the father burn instead ?
How was the son possessed ? The seance invites the demon into the house, but it must take some kind of complicated ritual to cause a possession.
The mother is normal, and tries to prevent the possession ; so why at the end does she suddenly become a witch herself ?
And anyway, Why are all the females decapitated ?",Hereditary

So, I went to see it for finding out which was the damn reality about this movie and why there was a huge amount of people that saw this as a nightmarish masterpiece and some other guys that thought this was garbage.And the truth is that it is neither one thing or the other. It is complex, nightmarish and highly disturbing to watch, mostly at the end, and it has sort of an old fashioned style comparable to horror cult classics like 'Rosemary's Baby'. But still, it is no masterpiece.First of all, I had a very big trouble with the acting. In my opinion, it was really exagerated at lots of scenes, particularily Toni Collette and sometimes Alex Wolff too. Probably it Is because their direction wasn't the best or because there were dialogues of the script that weren't helpful, or they just didn't made a great acting job that this movie needed to have.Still, I recommend this movie because of the creepy soundtrack, the very good and faded photography and its really horrifying atmosphere and feeling that leaves you when the credits start rolling. If you like to feel frightened by a movie at the cinema, this is it. Just don't expect Oscar worthy performances from it.Thanks for reading!",Hereditary

I just watched it and... i loved it, what more could i say about it. The main actress was incredible as a mother on the edge of a nervous breakdown, little Milly Shapiro did an excellent job as well as the others. The whole movie will send shivers down your spine with it's horrifying soundtrack, don't expect a typical fright flick with a whole bunch of jump scenes (there are a few, you'll see).

Obviously the studio paid a lot of money for favorable reviews around the net. And it works.

Now I'm not saying it's bad, it isn't, I just didn't think it was anything special. I will give it credit for not relying on jump scares like most horror nowadays does. I saw what they were going for, that dark, high tension, more of a psychological scare, it just didn't get there for me. And then towards the end it seemed to turn into an 80s satanic panic movie which made for great comedy but not horror.The actors were fine but no standouts for me. The only one I knew was Ann Dowd who I loved from The Leftovers. Her character was a bit of a cliche and she played it that way. I think that was on purpose, if so she did it well. If not, well.... sorry Ann, I still love ya. One casting that really bugged me was the guy who played Peter, he's supposed to be in high school but the kid looks 30! In one scene he tells his mom ""we're not even old enough to drink"" and I'm thinking - kid you would have no trouble buying alcohol.Am I glad I saw it? Sure, especially an advanced screening, always fun to see movies before other people. Would I bother to see it again? Nope. I think my suggestion would be to not spend the money to go to the theater. I'm sure it will be on dvd/blu/ondemand soon enough, just rent it. It's worth a rental",Hereditary
527,DasBobsWorld,Here's To Family!,7,19 February 2019,"Hereditary is an example of a movie you need to see during the hype train that existed at release. I feel like a movie that has been out for a while and is constantly getting praise leaves latecomers like myself in a bit of a wrong headspace going into a first watch. As it stands, Hereditary is a good film, with some interesting looks into family, and mental health wrapped neatly beneath a supernatural thriller. Did it melt my mind and slam me into the future of horror? No, but it was worth seeing.I am sure that most people have gone over the plot and such of this film. Also, the performance of Toni Collette is pretty damn near perfect. So, no need to talk about that. For me, Hereditary fell into a trap that a lot of the newer age ""horrors"" do. Length. For some reason, it's very hard to tell a good thrilling story and keep it under 100 minutes, let alone 90. Watching long stares, seemingly unending scenes, as well as repetitive scenes which only seem to be running over ground we have already watched more than once are not really my jam. That being said, there are some amazing moments of shock, heartbreak, drama, and horror that can't be downplayed. Also, the death of Charlie came right out of left field and I found it refreshing to have a movie surprise me.As for the ending, I didn't really mind it, although it felt like it belonged in another film. For most of the run time, Hereditary seems like a family drama of a very intense nature. The horror coming from seeing a group of people fall on hardship and hanging on by a thread just to keep what's left of their sanity. Having it end like a bit like Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones doesn't really help tell that story.So, Hereditary is good. It is worth your time, even at its long length, and I do think it is deserving of most of the praise it is getting. But, I am also inclined to think that it might have effected a bit too much by the hype train. Still, an easy recommend.",Hereditary
528,nooshie-33142,I don't scare easily - this movie haunted me for weeks!!!,9,7 July 2019,"This is one of the best horror movies I've seen for years. Now, I'm hard to please. I was brought up on horror classics of the 60s and 70s and I've seen it all. Hereditary is a throw back to the good old days of slow burn, psychological horror. It's scarily brilliant! The movie has the vibe of ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Shining"" and ""The Exorcist"". It slowly builds the tension until it's almost unbearable and then gives a disturbing pay off that made all that tension worthwhile. Modern audiences may find this movie a bit slow. Yes, the pacing is leisurely but its pulling you in slowly and has an inextricable hold on you. The acting is first rate. Toni Collette is a revelation and the smallish cast all do a great job. The movie is first and foremost a dark family drama. Without the supernatural element it plays like a Scandi Noir angsty drama about grief and family dynamics. Throw in the supernatural element and it's like nothing I've seen for years. I have been waiting for a movie to truly scare me for years. ""The Conjuring"" franchise has come the nearest and the spooky ""It Follows"". Hereditary stands head and shoulders above these movies. It haunted me for weeks and although I want to see it again, I'm not sure I should. The negative comments are mostly to do with pacing and it seems that a lot of viewers found the slow pace tedious. Its not your typical jump scare horror. It's much, much better than that!",Hereditary

530,zevt,Almost a masterpiece - frustrating writing/ending,7,6 November 2019,"This is an impressive horror movie with a lot going for it, but it is plagued by modern-day lazy writing which will frustrate a thinking audience. Lovers of this movie obviously haven't thought everything through as I will demonstrate below. And the slow-pace seemingly turned off a whole bunch of others, even though the superb gradually-building horror is one of its great strengths. The other impressive aspect is the acting, and this is universally acclaimed.It's about a family plagued by disturbing horror that has made them thoroughly dysfunctional. One death after another, each surrounded by mysterious and strange details, and their lives are constantly made worse by spooky hauntings and strange behavior and events. Suspicions of insanity are conflated with supernatural horror.The movie uses a heavy horror soundtrack and knows how to get under your skin using a mixture of classic horror and disturbing family drama and behavior. It does not resort to cheap jump-scares. (In fact, the movie could have been good even without the supernatural stuff by simply exploring insanity from trauma).*major spoilers follow*The one movie that this can be strongly compared to in terms of ideas and plot is Rosemary's Baby.The stuff that is clearly thought-out:Grandmother was obviously the leader of this cult that was trying to invoke Paimon in the bodies of her grandchildren. Presumably she wanted it done to her offspring for some reason, and they had to be young and 'vulnerable'. The previous attempt failed (Charlie) since she was female and they didn't know that this was important, and they had to kill her by invoking magic to undo it. There was also another failed attempt mentioned in the support meeting performed on Annie's brother. The rest of their efforts concentrated on Peter, whom they had to kill so that Paimon could take over his body. They even used and controlled her daughter (Annie) through 'sleepwalking' and possession to get their way, which is why she did all those strange and disturbing things to Peter.Joan, a cult member, was pure manipulation to get their way through psychological trickery (rather than possession which wasn't working so far). The seance was a distraction just to get her to read the incantation and involve her family and to bring Paimon's spirit into the house by calling Charlie's spirit (which previously hosted Paimon). This worked and escalated the horrors since Paimon was now hanging around the family as a malicious spirit, and it even tried killing Peter in school on its own. So their goal was to kill Peter for Paimon who was only now ready to take him.And now the stuff that wasn't thought through:If all they needed was Peter to die, then why didn't any of the cult members simply kill him in his sleep or some other way after Annie read the incantation? They had free access to the house obviously as is made clear many times. And it didn't require magic since obviously suicide was enough. And it didn't require him being scared and vulnerable since he obviously was petrified many times beforehand.If Annie had successfully burned Peter while 'sleepwalking' in the past, wouldn't this have deprived them of his body for Paimon? Plus, they hadn't yet released Paimon from Charlie at that time. So none of this sleepwalking stuff makes sense. Unless it was only her insanity added for random shock value.What was the big deal with the book that she tried to burn? It's just stupid pictures. Why did she believe it would help in any way? And why did the father burn down instead of her even though she threw it in the flames? Why did anyone burn at all? Either the book is meaningless in which case her motivation has no logic, or it is meaningful and yet it had no effect except to burn random people. 'Random malicious games by an evil spirit' doesn't explain why she was obsessed with the book to begin with while she was awake.What was the point of having Annie decapitate herself at that point towards the end? She was a useful tool until then and still hadn't achieved her purpose. So one can't even attribute this to 'random evil' from a being that likes decapitating people, since it's against their own interests. I mean they obviously were desperately trying to have her kill Peter until now and he still wasn't dead. In fact, what killed him was his own suicide from the surprise-shock of the three naked cult members after that. Which, once again, seems completely random and this from a cult that otherwise made careful plans. Inconsistencies galore!What's the point of the headless corpses? They were obviously dead since besides being headless, they were also decomposing and not moving. So why would the cult bother bringing them into the house and have them bow down in the final scene? Just more pointless shock tactics for the audience rather than the plot.In summary: The atmosphere and acting get 9 or even 10. The writing gets 8 or 1 depending on specific aspects of the plot. The problem is that the movie is effectively disturbing and seems like a great horror movie for most of its running time, except that the ending leaves you with unanswerable questions that don't allow the movie to make any sense. It's not just full of random malicious acts, it's also inconsistent with clearly stated motivations. So the frustration trumps the movie. This is a trend with recent horror movies that string together a bunch of creepy or shocking scenes for their own sake without tying them to the plot, or even working out whether they contradict the plot.",Hereditary

533,jpasols,Lived up to the hype and quotes as seen in the trailer!,10,23 December 2018,"Hereditary is seriously terrifying! My favorite horror film of 2018 followed by Halloween 2018 just because I'm a long time follower of the Halloween series. Anyway, back to this truly horrifying film, Hereditary is the story of a family who is thrust into a terrible and inescapable nightmare beginning with the death of the matriarch (the grandmother of the kids, and the mother of Toni Collete's character 'Annie'). The entire first half of the film is simply building the suspense and creating fantastic character development, the first half of the film also fills the audience with high tensions and complete dread which pays off in the second half of the film. The second half of the film (once the movie has you sucked into its horrifying vortex of non-stop madness) takes a much sinister turn as Annie as well as her sixteen year old son, Peter (played by Alex Wolfe) begin to discover the true terrifying secret of the family ancestry. Annie discovers that her late mother was apart of a cult which worshipped a demon named King Paimon, one of the eight kings of hell, (which also is the name of a REAL demon, not just a demon the director made up). After Annie finds out that a demonic force is after her son Peter to possess his body to enter the real world, Annie tries to desperately stop the madness by destroying her late daughter, Charlie's (played by Milly Sphario) sketch book, which is some kind of gateway for King Paimon.There's the giant gist of this terrifying film. Now my thoughts and review for this film is that first off I HAVE to give a HUGE shout out to an outstanding performance by Toni Collette! Collete NAILED this movie and I absolutely loved her in this! You really feel for her character and you can see how much she's going through and how hard she tries to keep her family together and her sanity in check while in the meantime she loses her 13 year old daughter, Charlie, in a violent car accident caused by Peter, and also trying to find her place as a mother, a wife, and used to be daughter (before her Satanist mom passed away). In a scene in the film, Annie talks about her childhood and how she has dealt with death before, her brother hung himself because he was depressed and kept claiming their mom kept trying to ""put people inside of him"", Annie's father passed away after he starved himself to death. So as for the character Annie, there are so many reasons to feel bad for her and Toni Collette absolutely MASTERS this role, I literally can't think of anyone better to play this role.The cinematography was astonishing and mesmerizing as well as eerie, the music score was absolutely dreadful, terrifying, and extremely bone-chilling. The story (plot) of this film is terrifically terrifying, gripping, Disturbing, and dreadful. What really makes this drama/supernatural suspense/horror film work is that there are NO cheesy jump scares, this film simply relies on the suspense, the dread, the mystery, and the psychological elements to get to the audiences deepest fears. It's a film that really gets into your head and once you see it once...theres no forgetting it. The heart stopping and frightening images will stick with you forever!. If you're reading negative reviews for this film IGNORE THEM! this movie IS terrifying and those who are saying it isn't are the type of people who rely on cheesy jump scares and lots and lots of action and Gore. This is not that kind of movie so dont be expecting that from Hereditary. BUT if you're looking for a film that will TRULY scare you to the core and get deep inside your head and will provide you with horror that will stick with you forever...Hereditary is definitely for you!!My final rating for Hereditary: 10 out of 10 Stars. No I'm not exaggerating. This film truly is that great! Watch for yourself!.",Hereditary
534,dnbaeb,It was ok and kind of interesting...,5,2 February 2020,"Until the last 20 minutes. Totally lost me in terms of tying this back to the grandmother and why the sister was born in the wrong body, etc., etc. I think they tried to answer questions at the very end, but it just fell short in my opinion. I think this could have been accomplished in less than 2:07 minutes.",Hereditary
535,paul-2148,"A beautiful, psychologically terrifying film",9,6 September 2018,"I was lucky in that I had never read a review or synopsis of this film before viewing. So from the beginning, I had no idea where it was going. I hate to compare it to another film because it is unique on its own, but I am reminded of Rosemary's Baby, where for most of the film you are wondering if you are just watching a masterful character study of madness in a claustrophobic NY apartment. At the end of that film you realize you have watched a film about contemporary satanism. 
Hereditary keeps you on the edge of your seat. It keeps you guessing. It's a slow boil of pychological horror. You also have the sense that you are watching a master filmmaker at work, an auteur to watch. 
I won't give anything away but in the last act of this film, you are exhausted and terrified. You are not exactly sure what you just saw. I will say this. There is no way in the beginning of this film to predict how it will end. There are enough pychological twists and moments of pure horror that it will keep you thinking about it for days after.",Hereditary
536,DrDarkness,"A bit controversial, but fun to watch",6,28 August 2018,"I am a horror movie fan, but this proved to be a bit difficult title to review. Did I enjoy it? Yes. How was the acting? Mostly good. Did the movie get to me? Here and there, yes. But would I watch it again? Probably not. Would I recommend this? Definitely, if you like suspenful horror films and despise jump scares - this is a movie for you.However, I do get why some people here have given this movie such a low score. It is a slow-paced story and yes, the ending could've been more unique or clever as the rest of the film had been. But by all means it's not horrible, far from it.If looking at the whole movie it's definitely enjoyable - yes, the pace is slow, but for myself I found most of the story so interesting that it didn't bother me at all. There were some very well done scenes where the time seems to stop, but it fits with the general atmosphere.So, the biggest problem for me was mostly the ending. It was still well excecuted and some scenes were highly disturbing - even when they looked like they were done with Photoshop and a steel wire. But it was like the writer/director had grown bored with the story just before the end and just let his neighbor finish it for him. This might sound harsh, but hey, I've seen worse.Still, as I said earlier, very enjoyable movie and most of the time it creates it's own path and doesn't slip to the clichés.",Hereditary
537,davish_wulf-1,3 quarters of boredom mixed with a ridiculous ending,1,2 September 2018,"Best part? The photography.
Worst part? The boredom of it all. The majority of the movie is a struggle with depression mixed with paranoia and thoughts of guilt.
When the movie really tries to finally ""start"", I was already so tired of it all, it was a struggle until the end.
Top of the cake of sillyness was a floating figure crossing a bedroom, swimming style, hanging by strings.
They couldn't even get the CGI flies right. The script was a complete mess blended with a imitation of the Conjuring soundtrack.
All in all a complete mess and I feel I just lost 2 hours of my life.
What kept me going was the fact that Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne were in it, otherwise I would have moved on after the first half an hour.
If this is getting 7.4 rating, compared to horror jewels like ""The Shining"", ""The Conjuring"" or even ""The Thing"", then I fear more of this garbage will come out, or even something of sequel.
To each his own taste I guess.. rating this a 1 for a total waste of time.

BS. I do not know what these reviewers saw but because of them and their positive reviews, I wasted money and time renting this movie. Not only is the first hour extremely slow and boring, the movie is not what it is hyped up to be. Sure once an hour passes, you get a few screams, jumps and scares but overall it was just a waste.

542,lurpak,A New Classic!,8,17 October 2018,"About time!
its been a long wait for m to find a horror genre film which was worthy of note, I had all but given up on them. Back in the 90's I went through a phase as a movie enthusiast, particularly in horror, so I watched a lot! Dated horrors such as Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Hellraiser, The Shining all spring to mind as a comparison to the originality of this film. It has something, an edge, an x factor that these other classics have. Finally, a writer and director who understands the true nature of what makes a good horror film isn't simply jump-scares, log cabin gore and ""found cam footage"" as per the flood of horror bilge over the past twenty years. This film is a modern classic fully deserved of all the praise it gets from now and for the next thirty years. Being an occultists myself (and noted authority, not that I'm bigging myself up, just assuring you of my credentials) I am also impressed with the authenticity of the subjects, to an extent, there is a little liberty for the benefit of entertainment. The film pulls no punches, and often leaves you asking what the...? just happened? Love it!
I'm hoping Ari Aster, doesn't leave it there....I want more, same world, same cult...here take my money! I only give it 8 stars as I always like to leave room for something beyond my experience. Its top notch...and if you read my other reviews, you will quickly see positivity does not come easily from me!restored my faith that horror films can be good..thank you!",Hereditary
543,diomavro,Poorly established,6,7 December 2019,"The movie does a very poor job of linking its elements together. Indeed you can't even tell what is real and what is imagined because of the way they set everything up (the protagonist is mental issues). It seems to imply that the daughter was possessed but we are not given any clue about this during the movie. It isn't clear if the apparitions we see in the beginning play ANY role in the story or if they are just imagined. Does burning the little book imply you get burned? If so why was it that when she throws the book in the fire the first time she gets burned but the second time the husband gets burned? Where is the logic? Is this explained? Was there a link to the pigeon and human decapitation? Why did the grandma's corpse need to be kidnapped? I thought the mothers job would play some role... but nope. They put a weird emphasis on one of the guys classmates, some blonde who is clever, or whatever but nothing ever becomes of that character, completely ignored. Anyway it all seems like completely disconnected elements.On the plus side the acting and filming aren't too bad.Honestly this movie just seems arbitrary, horror movies don't have to answer WHY the rules are what they are but they do have to answer WHY the rules changed within the movie.",Hereditary

546,thetyvonlesure,A Horror-Drama Spectacle,9,8 July 2019,"Hereditary is a brilliant mesh of horror and drama. The film is one of the most inspired original horror movies to date. The film provides a tame dialogue on mental illness and inheritance. The film's three acts are split in a manner that makes the progression very satisfying. Despite the slow pace, the film progresses in a manner that provides satisfaction. There are many twists and unexpected turns in this film and when the dust settles, the viewer is left retracing their steps and questioning their everything they just witness. Layered with superb detail, this film offers much story to dive into. The cinematography is masterful, with each shot and scene offering a greater look into the characters and the story as a whole. The shots in this film are incredibly stylized and unique. From start to finish, this film offers brilliant camera work. Toni Collette carries the film with her brilliant take on a suburban mother who has extensive family trouble. Toni Collette's shrieks of terror are something that will plague your psyche post viewing. Collette's role as Annie is some of the best acting from 2018. This film is brilliantly disturbing and psychological. As Ari Aster's Directorial debut for a feature film, this will definitely stand the test of time as one of the best horror films to date. Overall, Hereditary is an artistic love letter to Horror-Drama that will undoubtedly be coveted as a classic.",Hereditary

All a bunch of non sense.
This movie has a great atmosphere and splendid cast, but the script and moreover the narration lets it down. I seriously waited for one truly scary terrifying moment (there are actually some of these, but not many) that would maybe make it different from the norm (Conjuring) these days but was disappointed. It builds up slowly into something that appears to be great but ends up being not even mediocre.

Not sure about the plot and its otherworldly outcome, it is nonetheless captivating, slow but not boring, well executed and fantastically acted. Reminded me a lot of Polanski's works.It is not a gross out, not a slasher, no happy ending by the numbers crap and does not cater to all tastes, hence may be disappointing to some.

Netflix.'Hereditary' is unsettling, disturbing and horrible to watch, but it's not as interesting as a horror film should be. Horror lies in the audiences likeliness of the lead characters, but here, the lead character is a messed up joke. There aren't any distinct character traits that makes her stand out as the lead in the film.I liked that they built up more suspense than horror through out the film by panning the camera from the character's reaction, but even that got repetitive and frustrating towards the end of the film. Like any other horror film, the circumstances are not at all defined, the logic is questionable and the film paces up and ends up abruptly.The acting was great. Casting - on point. Tony - perfect actress. All except the characters that lack depth. Take any frame of the film, the characters will look confused, same as the audience, as of what's the point in this, whole lot of film, that's nothing but a horrible mess.",Hereditary
566,dazjohnson,Pathetic,2,16 June 2020,"Well I saw the trailer and thought to myself now that looks scary!! The first thirty minutes were fine and I believed it was building up into a good film and hopefully a great finale. Oh dear how wrong can one person be.
The decapitation of the young girl actually did happen, and why would they go through with it as it was obviously thing to do so why ? I fully expected it not to happen (wrong) and then it would deliver something actually surprising totally out of the blue and frighten the audience out of their seats.
Those people saying this was pure art and gave it the full ten stars !! I obviously think they were smoking something Ilegal before they entered the cinema, I am sorry people this was not art !! this was just a shambles and before those critics will say I did not understand this movie,well unfortunately I did oh to well, and what it was attempting to deliver it failed dismally everytime, if it was trying to get the audience nervous in any way or even scared it failed every time because all I did was smile and laugh throughout every time it went for a quick fright.
I am sadly beginning to think the horror genre is now on the verge of being dead for good ( I hope I am wrong) and i am afraid it may be going the same way as the good old westerns genre what also have had their day, and are now consigned to cinema past along with silent films.
This latest attempt left most of the audience laughing that is definitely not what the director was going for and expecting. I know all the ones who have given the higher ratings will say to me and the many others who have hated this dismal movie, that we just do not understand it, well I obviously was not in on their joke ! But I hate to say sorry i was getting it and i got it now, because as one of viewers who is still laughing at what unfolded has it went on !!
Finally I gave it its two stars because of the opening thirty minutes, after that it became a train wreck. Sorry for the spoilers at times in my review , but i am just trying to get my point across.

Too often these days we are left disappointed with so called horror films, but please be in no doubt Hereditary is the real deal, it is macabre, suspenseful and very very disturbing.
In truth I cannot say I enjoyed the film, but that is subjective and no reflection on the movie, it does what it set out to do, to scare and disturb the audience and it does this in good measure
If I have any criticisms then I would say it is a little too long and some of the incidents are not properly explained but then that just adds to the mystery and suspense.
The ending seemed a little off kilter, and left me a few questions which I am still mulling over

577,mrosesteed,Creepy but unrelatable and very slow,4,6 April 2019,"Hereditary is a gruesome, dark ""indie"" family drama, which gradually transitions from real life to supernaural horrors. Aiming for a slow build, its style is characterized by long silences, subtly altered colors, a gliding camera, and a muted soundscape overrun by heavily ominous, atmospheric music. However, after some early brutal shocks and eerie scares, the film's creepy vibe cannot maintain sufficient tension to support its multiple troubled protagonists and excruciating pace.",Hereditary
578,tohkwongweng,Witchcraft and Demonic possession,2,8 November 2018,"I was hoping to catch this one on the big screen but due to work and family commitments was unable to,so I bought the dvd. I'm glad now that I missed it. Obviously Hollywood critics have absolutely no idea what makes a really great scary movie and there is no conceivable way this deserves any more than a 2 and I gave it that because the scares, mild as they were, only came in the last 15 minutes. The rest of the movie was incredibly boring and absolutely too long. Additionally I had to put up with depressing issues of anger, hate, resentment and guilt! Of course the demon King Paimon, one of the 8 kings of hell, finds an easy target! Didn't quite understand either why it was called 'Hereditary' either, other than Grandma being a satanic witch who cursed her own family. And why all the naked old ghosts towards the end? Nonsensical! What was the significance of headless grandma's corpse? Nothing made sense and no decent answers were provided! Was Charlie a witch in making too or just an unwilling victim? 2 hours I wasted on this one. Give it a really wide berth, seriously.",Hereditary

581,ikizdevran-882-254684,Not very good,5,24 July 2018,"Hereditary is the first film I have ever watched in the cinema all by myself. I have been following its IMDB rating constantly, and finally I have decided to go see it. I was casually asking my friends if they want to go and see it with me, but no one seemed particularly interested so I gave up on the idea. Two days ago, after I came home I decided to go and see it all by myself. I went to the cinema, bought a large cup of coffee, took a seat in the highest row and watched Hereditary in late night viewing. After I have finished the film, I was feeling very good about myself and took the decision to do this activity more often. Hereditary is a conclusive proof of how the final of a film can destroy everything that the director has built. I will never decide to watch a film based on its IMDB's point. I start to believe that there is a certain community who deliberately boost the reputation of a bad film. I think soon enough this will damage the IMDB's reputation. Hereditary is not necessarily a bad film, but it doesn't deserve the point it has. Right now, it has 7.6 points. I wouldn't give this film more than 5. When it ended, everyone in the cinema hall was talking in disappointment.Some families are not meant to be happy. This is the story of one of those families. Graham family consists of Annie Graham (Toni Collette), Steve Graham (Gabriel Byrne), Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro). They live in an isolated house on their own. The film opens with family attending Annie's mother's funeral. In the eulogy, Annie explains her relationship with her mother, mentions about her mother's complete isolation in the last moments of her life. Annie states that during her growing up, her family suffered from a series of mental illnesses which end up in their deaths. At first, Graham family, especially Annie, seems to be normal except for the 13-year-old Charlie. Charlie and her grandmother had a special relationship, and Charlie has a tough time accepting the fact that her grandmother is dead. Raised mostly by her grandmother, looking at the weird behaviors of Charlie, I understand the weird life of the grandmother. Released on January 21, 2018 in Sundance Film Festival, and June 8, 2018 in United States, Hereditary is written and directed by Ari Aster. With its 127 minutes runtime, it is Ari Aster's directorial debut.Annie meets a woman in a support group. This woman invites Annie to her house to perform a séance to communicate with her death grandson. Up until this point, everything seems to be normal in the Graham family. The strange occurrences happening in the family are relatively logical. Death of Charlie or the robbed grave of the grandmother seem to be extreme things, but not illogical. After the séance, Hereditary slowly dives into supernatural incidents that reveal the secret of the family, but connection of the story with its final destroyed everything the director has built until that point. I can't imagine a worse ending for such an interesting story. Director uses thriller genre to its limits. She manages to keep audience alert and curious. During the film, against the classic expectations of a horror film, nothing happens when they are expected to happen. This film shows us that, the director really knows thriller genre. She uses its power to the limits. She doesn't use sound or special effects to make you jump. She uses the atmosphere as if something will happen soon. This is how thriller genre should be. That's why Hereditary is more of a thriller/horror film.The atmosphere, camera and music are the strongest points of the film. These components are very important when it comes to horror. Director uses them for her advantage. If the story could have kept up with these components, we would be seeing a really good horror film. I couldn't believe how such an interesting story got destroyed with the most senseless final possible. It fails big time to combine the story with its ending. I get the feeling that she brings the story until the end and gets stuck there. Despite the performance of her career, even Toni Collette couldn't save the film. I believe Ani Aster is going to be a successful director, but in Hereditary I have understood once more, how important experience is when it comes to directing. In my opinion her lack of experience destroyed a promising film.",Hereditary

583,TheJohnnyPHreak,One of the best horror films of the last decade,9,26 January 2019,"I try not to give into the hype. I hate when I give into the hype of a film and totally let down. It happens way too often than not. Put so much expectation on a film that it can never live up to the hype. Hereditary is one of those films that had so much hype behind it. I never got to see it in theaters. And at some time I was turned off by the hype. I barely even watch the trailer for the film. It just didn't interest me. I had no idea for a while that it was even a horror movie. It just looked like supernatural drama. Thankfully, I wasn't also spoiled for the ending or any of the key story elements. I am kind of disappointed that I couldn't give the film my cash dollars. It would have been a worthwhile investment. Hereditary lives up to the hype and then some.The film stars Toni Collette as the mother of a family, who just lost their grandmother. Rounding out that family is Gabriel Byrne as the father Steve, Alex Wolff as the oldest Peter and newcomer Milly Shapiro as the youngest, daughter Charlie. After the passing of the family's grandmother, odd occurrences and deep-rooted family secrets start to emerge. That's all you need to know about this film. I would even stay away from any trailers. Because the less you know the better off you are. First time directed Ari Aster crafts a family grieving drama that happens to be one of the most messed up horror films I've ever seen. I will not lie during the last five to ten minutes my jaw had dropped and was open the entire time.For a first time filmmaker, this man has his technical devices, storytelling and acting down like he's a pro. Toni Collette gives one, if not the best performance of her career as Annie, the mother who is dealing with the loss of her mother and a family that is just clinging together. You feel for her, you cry with her and for her. You just want the rest of family to believe her when things start happening. And we as the viewers are just as clueless as to what is going on as she is. But when it all opens up its eye-opening. It's terrible that she didn't get much award season love. (Especially from the Oscars, as she should have got a nomination for Best Actress)Byrne is very believable as the father who is lost as what to do about his wife and trying to make sure his children are safe. Alex Wolff is excellent as Peter. He has to deal with the loss of grandmother he never knows but just trying to be a high school kid. As his mother's mental health deteriorates so does his. Milly Shapiro rounds out the cast. Her performance for a newcomer is so deep. We are not sure what is going on with her but her dialogue and everything she does is important to story.Aster, who also wrote the film, layers the film with a deep history. And once each layer is peeled back we get a deep dive into a family that is more trouble than we see on the surface. And it's maybe coming from one source. There is really no exposition which elevates the film. Dialogue is never used to explain anything. We follow this family as they deal with the aftermath of the grandmother's death. Sounds play a great role in the film and the sound design is superb. There's not much music outside of songs that are built into the story. The sound is used to throw off and mess with the audience. The film is excellently shot. With each scene meant to explain something. No shot goes wasted. And there are things missed on first viewing. This is a film so rich it has to be experienced multiples times. I know there are things I missed or didn't understand well enough on first viewing.Plus Aster knows his horror and supernatural elements. When the film gets outerworldly the sound plays a very important key. But the director builds tension with some of his sound and cinematography. Blink and you might miss something that was key to explaining the story. But when it turns to horror the film is grotesque. This man loves the horror genre and I commend him for it. Hereditary in the long game will go down as one of the best supernatural horror films of all time sitting next to films like The Exorcist and The Omen. Aster has created a layered, beautiful and haunting horror film that shocks and digs deep. This is no doubt the best horror film of 2018. It's also one of the best horror films of the last decade.",Hereditary
584,stephenbishop-22925,I found it funny,3,29 December 2018,"Horror? Just. When the girls head gets knocked off is good horror. Apart from that, floating people up to the treehouse is just hilarious. And I was just glad that I wasn't the only person in the cinema laughing.
It's not bad. Slow and sometimes atmospheric. I wouldn't give it any awards, and can't understand why the film magazines rated it so highly.
Just another film rushed out under the horror genre. Story is ok, script is ok. Film? Not one I found very good.",Hereditary
585,Sudarshan_Pawar,Dark and Spine-Chilling,10,12 December 2020,"Hereditary is a very different approach towards horror movies. Haven't seen such dark psychological horror film like this since The Witch (2015). Films like The Witch and Hereditary creates their own Horror sub-genre.
This movie is not for everyone. If you're thinking of watching a horror movie where ghost/spirits comes and haunts people or a big house that is haunted then Hereditary is not the one of that kind. Also this movie is not for those having a short attention span.
The storytelling style is outstanding and the director has done a great work. Toni Collette gives a performance that will be in your mind for a long time. This kind of movies can be enjoyed by multiple viewings. A must watch for all the horror genre fans.",Hereditary
586,neoclone07,A masterpiece of the genre,8,20 October 2020,"At first I'd got skeptical about watching Hereditary. Thought it would be just another flawed try of a horror tale. After all, 2018 had not brought up a nice harvest of the genre so far. Suddenly, it was all about Hereditary. I rushed to watch it and got mesmerized with the somber, weird atmosphere, complex script and the plot twist that wrapped the movie by the end. A masterpiece of horror was born. Tony Collete deserved at least a nomination for her performing. Actually, the movie itself should have earned a nomination... it's not only a good movie of horror, it's also has technical achievement. It's a drama... entangled in horror.

590,erikacunanan29,How about no.,3,3 September 2018,"I really disliked this movie. It was intriguing in the beginning but not even halfway through the movie, things got boring. It had a very slow pacing and everything got confusing. The story went to weird directions and the ending sucked. Probably would have been better if there were back stories about the grandma. I absolutely felt nothing for the characters even though they were experiencing terrible things. The movie didn't feel like a horror to me. Sure, there were some jump-scare scenes but I really didn't feel scared. The actor for Peter didn't look anything like his family members. It distracted me because you can really see that they are not related in real life. Toni Colette's acting was great but I felt that at times it seems like she was overacting for a scene which resulted to me not appreciating some scenes more.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Absolutely not (unless you want to waste 2 hours of your life).
WOULD I WATCH IT AGAIN: Absolutely not.",Hereditary
591,N-whymark,Generous score . Don't believe the hype,4,16 June 2018,I deliberately didn't read any reviews on this film before watching it last night. Now I have and would recommend anyone watching it to read some reviews which explain the film and storyline. Some great acting and some great scenes . But in my opinion more of a drama/thriller than a horror. Very slow burning and even when it does get going it's still slow. I love horror films but recently none seem to be what I'd class as a horror film. During this film a lot of people laughed at some scenes. A lot of people after also said how disappointed they were in it. Originally a three hour film which would be interesting to see if it explained it a bit better in three hours.

Sadly, It's less clever and original than it really ends up being with the left field art house direction likely to turn casual cinema-goers off, leaving viewers feeling baffled and un-satisfied with its ultimate conclusion.Technically, very well crafted (especially the score and the disturbing imagery at times) but the plot sadly lacks depth.",Hereditary

596,reid-hawk,"Disturbing, painful, and absolutely terrifying",10,19 June 2018,"About halfway through Hereditary I remember debating whether I knew I needed to see this movie again to decipher and appreciate its themes and details more, or whether this was a film I never in my life want to view again. At this moment I'm leaning toward needing a rewatch, but I'll definitely need to be in a certain mood for it. This is because Hereditary is absolutely one of the most emotionally painful and horrifying movies I have ever seen, and maybe ever made. The scenes of family drama are so gut-wrenching and powerful that they gave me chills, while the rest of the movie scared me worse than I have been scared since I first watched ""The Sixth Sense"" when I was around 12 years old and basically pooped my pants. In fact, after being scared poopless by that movie as well as ""Insidious"" and the second Paranormal Activity movie at a young age, I really thought I was immune to horror movies, as if they scared me so bad that nothing would compare to the fear I felt while watching them. Sure, movies like ""the Shining"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and ""Lost Highway"" definitely had me shaken up at times, but I have not truly felt as terrified as I did while watching ""Hereditary"" in a long long time. 
My IMDB account says I have watched and rated 248 horror movies and TV shows, and only rated 6 perfect 10/10s. I enjoy the horror genre, but I also know that I am very hard on it as well. When done right horror movies can be the among the most entertaining forms of cinema to watch, but more often than not they are done very poorly. I bring this up because I think it makes it mean more when I say ""Hereditary"" is truly a 10/10 horror film to me. Yet to just label it a mere horror film is a major disservice. The scenes of family drama are so painful and lifelike that the only movie I can really compare it to is ""In The Bedroom"", one of my favorite movies, yet I think even then Hereditary is a far more painful and heartbreaking watch. It is not paced like a traditional scare-fest horror film either. It gives out little pieces of information throughout its runtime to keep the audience engaged, but it never forces scares or even seems to feel like it has to be scary all the time. It would much rather keep you on edge by making you ask: ""who/what was that little ghost boy in the corner? What was in the mother's drink that got on her lips at her friend's house? Why does the little girl cut up birds? What does the grandmother's final note mean?"" and much more. Some of these questions are answered soon after, some much later in the film, and some not directly at all. These little morsels of mystery, plus a commanding and edgy score will keep you on your toes throughout all of ""Hereditary's"" runtime. And then when it feels like maybe you have pinned down the direction it is going in it hits you with one of the most shocking and unexpected movies scenes I have ever watched. I'm of course talking about the decapitation scene.
The trailers do a great job of making this scene feel even more like a misdirection, because the creepy little girl is the focal-point of all of them. Never in my life would I have thought that the film would kill her off in such a gruesome fashion less than 45 minutes into its runtime. When this happens you really think poop is about to hit the fan, but instead the film rakes you over the coals by making you a fly on the wall of a truly broken and destroyed family for nearly the next hour. And then the séance scene happens, and at this point I had come to accept this movie as a masterpiece. I remember my eyes literally watering due to me be so afraid during that sequence. What makes it so scary is what makes the rest of the movie so scary as well: camera movement, the score, and incredible lighting.
This movie did not have a single true jumpscare in it, because it knew how to use the threat of a jumpscare to keep you nervous instead. Most of the film's scarier scenes consisted of long takes where the camera moves in and out of close-ups. Usually in horror films, these close-ups build up tension which is released through a jumpscare when the camera moves back out to a wide-shot. ""Hereditary"" knows this, and instead decides that it is not going to use a cheap jumpscare to release the tension, and instead let the tension linger... and linger... and linger until you feel like your heart is going to bust. All the while, the score drones on and pushes you and the scene forward much like the score in last year's ""Dunkirk"". I'm also not an expert by any means in lighting, but this film's darkness and shadows feel so natural and realistic. You are constantly questioning the shadowy backgrounds thinking ""did I see something back there or is my mind playing tricks on me"" much like you would do in real life. I have no idea how the lighting was done, but this along with the other two aspects I just mentioned are truly innovative and make this movie quiet possibly the scariest movie ever made. Yeah I'll just go right out and say it.
Don't forget that this movie is a hard R rating as well due to the imagery in it being so disgusting and disturbing at times. I truly think the scene of the daughter's decapitated head being devoured by ants as it melts into the side of the road, or where the mother bangs her head on the attic door like the demons in ""Jacobs Ladder"" do will stay with me for the rest of my life, and those are only two of many absolutely screwed up parts throughout the movie's runtime. I know I'm just gushing about ""Hereditary"" at this point, but I honestly have no problems with it except the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but it's hard to live up to the rest of the film's utterly brilliant writing so I don't really blame it too much. I mean the foreshadowing and layers upon layers of details in this movie could be dissected for hours upon end, and honestly after I see it a second and third time (if I can stomach it) that is exactly what I will do. This movie has the potential to be a future classic in my opinion, and I don't see how any other movie is going to beat it as my favorite film of 2018.",Hereditary

599,bilaltat,One of the best of this genre,10,25 December 2019,"I know that there are so many people judging the movie due to overhypness, cliches and lack of horror themes. However the main theme of the movie is far different from this.First of all, i want to categorize these kind of movies into 2 categories: Horror and Mystery. After watching so many type of these movies, horror should not be the main theme of a horror movie, however mystery should be. There are so many types of jumpscare movies in industry and most of them are worth nothing. Nonetheless, when you add the mystery part to the plot and when you interact with the audience to solve the puzzle it values much more but this type of movies are not for everyone.Main horror theme which is not the main theme of this movie is the mystery's itself. The mystery is behind the occult theme, demonology, trapping of the family, unclear cinematic effects at first. To be more precise, the horror behind the movie is the horror of unknown which is the mystery's horror effect. There are also so many plot twists that surprise the audience. It is not the movie that can be totally understandable at first watch. After the first watch, as a matter of course you create ""conspiracy theories"" about the movie, about the details. You begin to search who is King Paimon what is his role in Arc Goetia. What is the meaning of clucking sounds and if you have watched carefully, you will begin to search what are those blue light effects in the movie what is the point of the usage of effects and you are going to see it is all settled brilliantly.I am actually a fan of these kind of occult mystery movies. However, this is not creating a bias after watching so many bad movies of this genre.Actings are good, music, coreography and their relation with cinematography is well builded. 10/10",Hereditary
600,saeedahmedsasoli,"Often the more ""traditional"" horror.",10,17 November 2020,"If a horror movie fails to deliver those goods, it's scoffed at and falls into the ""worst film I've ever seen"" category. I put that in quotes because a disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across the theater as the credits for this film rolled. He really wanted us to know his thoughts. For all that praise and as excellent as I think it is, Hereditary isn't quite a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I was very much invested and riveted throughout the length of the film, there were some detectable pacing issues. I feel conflicted in saying that because I'm very much a fan of the slow-burn horror style which benefits from a deliberate pace, but I did get the occasional nagging sense that things could've been tightened up just a tad without losing the effect. Some of the scares in the film, often the more ""traditional"" horror moments, also struck slightly the wrong note with me on a first viewing and were just a hair too campy or on-the-nose given how visionary and restrained the majority of the film is. And in its ending few minutes, the film really shows its full hand when a bit more ambiguity may have served it better.It turns into a genuine nightmare that absolutely worked for me. See it blind, see it as a movie first and foremost (not as a horror show with jump scares), but just see it. To say much of this film is to ruin it, so lashing praise onto certain aspects of it is the best one can do. Not to say this is a film with a big twist, it isn't. Toni Collette is fantastic as is no surprise at this point in her career. All the performances carry their own, including one I was unsure of at first but grew on me throughout -- Alex Wolff. The cinematography, rhythms and pacing, sense of place and space, and sound design are all superb and work in conjunction to create atmosphere and dread -- like a pit in your stomach that continues to grow and grow throughout.If viewed without expectations, you will leave the theatre satisfied, with the knowledge that this can be considered as another fine example of the recent high-quality, uniquely-imagined independent horror story releases. The acting is top-notch, the production is near flawless, and, short of a few complaints with the presentation of the ending, the direction should excite everyone looking ahead to future genre films from Aster. Simply a must-see film.",Hereditary

That being said, I would have preferred the explanation be left to the viewer. So many times, directors feel the need to give the audience some kind of reason. This movie didn't need it. The fear that existed in these people's lives was so rich and deep, so wrought with sadness and tragedy, psychosis and complexity, I didn't care why. I only cared about the possibility. Showing me that ruined it. Made it less. That being said, if you like a really solid movie with a visual authenticity (save the flies) and a few jump scares definitely worth a watch.",Hereditary
602,littlemankazoo,An Unconventional Horror Thrill Ride,8,13 June 2018,"In this age of horror being very much reliant on the gimmicks and unique right hooks to the audience to get them into the seats, it's not entirely common that one sees a good old fashioned spook-house horror film.No gimmicks. No twists. Just a film that does its absolute best to get your skin crawling, nerves tightened, and heart pounding.'Hereditary', as you may imagine, is one of those films.'Hereditary' is about as simple as a horror movie nowadays can come; terrible circumstances befall a seemingly ordinary family, these circumstances lead to discoveries of something terrible in their family tree, and soon enough things come apart rather quickly.What this film excels at is all in the technicals. The performances are all beyond convincing and do the job selling the understated terror this film has to offer. Specifically, Toni Collette delivers in a manner that had even my skin crawling.What is also noticeable when it comes to this film's strengths is the excellent cinematography. While it is perhaps not as flashy and noticeable as 'Upgrade' and its revolutionary camera-work that I raved about, this film accomplishes a more suitable sense of suspense and nerve-wracking tension through it. Whether in-motion or standing completely still, the camera makes itself apparent in this film and works beyond effectively.The only thing of it is, this film is not for you if you prefer a straightforward and conventional horror film. The first act is very much a slow burn, while the rest of the film builds its horror and tension in ways that I do not believe a general audience would appreciate quite as much. It's not abstract, but considering it lacks the conventions of jumpscares and instead relies on atmosphere, mood, and its performances to scare...that perhaps explains a bit why the film is striking the general audience as so polarizing.But, if you can appreciate a slow, creepy, atmospheric film that aims directly to make your skin crawl and make you shuffle in your seat, I think you'll truly enjoy the ride this film takes you on.Unconventional, scary as hell, but perhaps not perfect in what it aspires to do, 'Hereditary' is still a scary time for all the right reasons.",Hereditary
603,chancellorpink,Effective But Derivative,6,13 June 2018,"Younger people may find the film slow, as pace is secondary to mood, here. And mood can best be described as bleakAF. Every frame is filled with dread. So much so that the film lacks a sense of the flowing nature of normal life. The characters aren't people you'd want to have over to dinner, and although the acting is top notch, it's a family of folks at the bottom rungs of their family (attic) ladder. And it's super yucky to drop into their world for 2 hours.Although creating a relentlessly grim & grimy tone which infuses the film with a near sleep-walking texture of story telling, Aster does a nice job of inserting a few shocker moments and tense dramatic confrontations along the way, keeping the narrative interesting, and the music is effective, so his film is never less than compelling to watch.But in the end, that's not really enough, and it's a reach for me to give this movie a 6 (I seriously considered 5), mostly because there's very little here that's original. The ending borrows heavily from films like Rosemary's Baby, Wicker Man and (more recently) Kill List, and middle parts conjure up Insidious meets The Conjuring. Even the mother's miniature house models are an idea snatched from Beetlejuice.It's a nice little mash up of horror tales of yesteryear by Ari Aster, but horror and mystery are uniquely effective only when they are original, and originality is hard to come by. You won't find it here.PS Someone needs to tell these new-fab creators of modern horror that its perfectly ok for horror film characters, and their viewing audiences, to laugh once in a while, you know, in between all the incantations and severed heads.",Hereditary
604,midnightmosesuk,Someone understands how horror works....,8,10 September 2018,"People had been saying that Hereditary is this generation's Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby. Big claims. I don't think I can agree that it's as good as either of those classics but it's probably one of the best horror films in recent years, and there have been some very strong contenders.If I were to compare it to either of the horror classics mentioned above I'd say it more closely resembles Rosemary's Baby. It has the same sense of evil, the paranoia of conspirators moving behind the scenes to manipulate their target for infernal ends and the crushing claustrophobia of being isolated from any help or shelter that might save them from their ultimate fate.But not only is it an effective horror but it's also a tragedy. These characters are doomed from the very start, the events that befall them are triggered by their own weaknesses. We watch a family falling to bits because of the grief and guilt associated with a terrible accident.I purposely avoided spoilers before watching this film, it's best seen without preconceptions but, anyone who has read even a little bit on the occult will pick up on the direction it's going within the first 10 minutes! Even so, it very effectively builds a sense of dread and fear without a reliance on jump scares.Well worth seeing.",Hereditary
605,afrocut,Compelled to write this,7,9 June 2018,"As usual the movie reviewing public is at their lowest as they scramble to either overly hate something (these people who give a 1 to a movie indicating it has no merits at all and think some how it is the worst thing ever made or at least in line with one ) or overly praise it (people who give it a perfect score like it has no problem and it should be up for the academy award for best picture ) . It's ok, people, to think a movie is some times mediocre. And that's where we find Hereditary. For me, the film rises weakly above mediocre horror fare of recent years , but just barely . It is no waste of time or garbage as these 1 star reviewers would have you believe , but it is a slow burn filled with great character moments and exploration of how we react to horrific events... but that's where we will lose those kind of viewers , they mostly see this as boring and are looking for constant jump scares. I get it , I do , the movie does have the sin of feeling its run time , something you never want your viewers to do. But I have to admit I was glued to the screen throughout and couldn't wait to see where it would go . It's where it goes that loses me and probably has the reviewers giving it a perfect score boasting it for being so different and demented . The movie is confused and because of this there's two different films living in one space fighting for control , one movie that is a horrific drama that is interesting and thought provoking, filled to the brim with emotional human darkness and the film we ended up getting ,a typical horror movie that you can clearly see coming from a mile away . It's that turn that hurts it, destroying what could have been amazing and leaves you walking out very unsatasfied . maybe that's what the movie intended and if so I applaud the director and writer ,just don't ask me to say this is an amazing movie . It isn't . What I'll say is that it is a well shot , well acted , suspenseful horror drama that doesn't need to rely on jump scares to be creepy and unnerving , but it will feel long , confused and unfortunately cause unintentional nervous laughing and will end with a unsatasfied taste in your mouth.",Hereditary
606,jg_1977,So much more than just horror,10,10 June 2018,"Hereditary is hands down the most surprising, upsetting, and well-crafted movie I've seen this year. What makes this movie stand out is that it spends a lot more time than you'd expect setting the stage for a family drama to unfold before transitioning into a full on horror film. That makes you far more sympathetic to the characters and more invested in the final outcome than many other horror movies. Also, the storytelling in this movie needs to be applauded. The audience is never spoon fed answers about what is happening, but just given subtle clues one piece at a time, until the ending where you finally walk away with a complete picture. Also for people who are seeing this movie only for the horror element, it won't be what you are expecting but it also won't disappoint. The director exercised incredible restraint. When watching it you begin to think you sense a jump scare coming that any other movie would have, but instead, the scene fully plays out without one. What this does is build tension through the whole movie, making the ending that much more horrifying because the director finally lets loose. Lastly, I need to mention the acting in this film. Toni Colette and Alex Wolf in particular deliver powerhouse performances that elicit the full range of emotions. Hopefully once Oscar season rolls around, these two won't be forgotten, because their performances are truly worthy of nomination. Over all, if you are a horror fan, film enthusiast, or just want to see a good movie, Hereditary is the movie for you to see.",Hereditary
607,olovsimonsson,Disappointment,5,28 August 2018,"Perhaps if critics had not called it the scariest movie ever, and the distributors subsequently sold it as that (referring to said critics), maybe I would have liked it better. But on the other hand, maybe not. Tony Collette is brilliant as always and is the sole reason for pushing my rating from 3 stars to 5. Aside from her, the movie hasn't got much to brag about. It's a movie that can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a family drama or a horror movie, and ending up being neither, rather than both. It is a movie I've seen in many versions before, and this is the artistic version. Except for the ending, which is not artistic at all, nor dramatic or frightening. In fact, it almost seemed to have been edited in from some ridiculous B-horror movie from the 70's.Maybe if they had edited out all the ""horror"" scenes and focused on the drama surrounding the family after the tragic events that they experience, I'm certain it would have been a very good drama. But now, it is simply two hours of disappointment.",Hereditary
608,chrisw-17947,Best horror movie of 2018,8,11 August 2018,"Hereditary I would give a solid 8.5/10. Here are the reasons why I loved it and some parts I didn't like about it.Positive Thoughts: Hereditary is definitely not one of those horror movies that are meant for the mainstream audience to watch such as ""mother!"" and are used to horror movies that mostly have jump scares like IT or Insidious. Instead, this doesnt have any jump scares and has the tendency to make you linger and get chills down your spine. Toni Collettes performance as Annie was phenomenal and will be unforgettable because of how much character she brought to life inside after Charlie, the daughter of the Graham family died and turns out to be more serious and insanely horrific. Alex Wolff was without a doubt great and Milly Shapiro gave me chills. The cinematography is brilliant because its unusual from other movies I have seen before. Also, the music score is beyond amazing and causes me to think and get spooked while listening to the spine-tingling music. The magnificent use of grief and fear becoming a malicious duo is brilliant.Negative Thoughts: Even though this is definitely horrifying. There are a few moments where I unintentionally laughed at that were supposed to be taken serious. Sometimes when Peter (Alex Wolff) was crying I tried too hard to not laugh a bit. About 15 mins in this movie where a bird flies into a window at Charlie's (Milly Shapiro) school, she cuts off its head and I thought that was a tad bit hilarious. That was the main issue that almost ruined the movie for me.Regardless of my dislikes about Hereditary, it is an amazing horror movie and I would recommend anyone who has never seen it to go and watch it.",Hereditary
609,mt-95256,A Masterful Nightmare You'll Never Forget,8,29 June 2018,"TL;DRIncredible for a directorial debut from Ari AsterUnforgettable in all the good (and horrifying) waysSlow start that reveals a well-developed plotIncludes one of the most shocking and unpredictable scenes in cinemaEternal sense of dread - horror throughout the entire filmDoesn't need to rely on cheap jump-scaresBrilliant performances from whole castWhen a trailer can proudly boast that a film is ""from the producer of The Witch"" (presumably referring to producer Lars Knudsen), that's more than impressive enough credentials to lure in even the most discerning horror fan. Though many may not have seen The Witch, it definitely made an impression, provoking a lot of talk about it. Hereditary is similar; it's absolutely not for everyone... but it's impossible not to talk about it, let alone forget it. Even more incredible for a directorial debut, Ari Aster has created a horror masterpiece that will provoke nightmares for generations to come.As has been made clear by some disgruntled audiences (for whom I admit having an ounce of contempt), it is rather slow to get going - but that's not to say it's ever boring. On the contrary, one accolade Hereditary can be proud of is that it is never dull. It starts more like a drama about a family learning to deal with the passing of a family-member, but it's only when the horror really kicks in that we start to see the film's fantastically well-crafted story. Even before this point though, there is a sinister undertone; a threatening atmosphere that never lets you feel comfortable or safe. Once the horror plot starts to take shape, it's enjoyable to discover the little pieces of information, only really allowing you to understand at the very end. In fact, at the end there is a line which is a little too on-the-nose, explicitly explaining the plot for anyone who fell asleep half-way through. But it's a well-developed plot that may be light on jump scares, but is heavy on everything else. The U-turn is unforgettable, sticking in my mind as one of the most shocking and unpredictable scenes in cinema.There's a reason Hereditary is being hailed as this generation's The Exorcist. There are several moments in The Exorcist which have gone down in cinematic history; running down the stairs backwards, the spinning head, the act with the crucifix... to name just a few! Several shocking, even chilling and downright terrifying, moments are found throughout Hereditary, especially at the end. Not to say that there are no scares until then; an eternal sense of dread lasts throughout the film and culminates in pure terror. A little silhouette in the corner of the screen that different members of the audience will notice, gasps of shock rippling through the auditorium; countless decapitations; enigmatic moments that will haunt your dreams. Hereditary is a sophisticated horror, not needing to rely on cheap jump scares to terrify. The music is used brilliantly too, able to heighten tension at just the right time.The cast really sell it too. Even with a small one of just four or five main characters, they all pull their weight. Despite irritating crying throughout, Alex Wolff contributes more than in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle; a noticeably different character at the end, Wolff's Peter is the unsung protagonist of the film. One scene in particular, involves him just sitting at the wheel of a car for an endlessly long time, all his character's emotions and thoughts easily legible from just his face and eyes. Byrne's Steve takes a while for his character to really become layered and interesting, but when all hell breaks loose and only Annie and Peter are aware, you don't know whether to feel sorry or frustrated with him. However, it's Toni Collette and Milly Shapiro who really steal the show. The fact that, along with director Aster, this is Shapiro's first film is astounding. Even without the disconcerting make-up, Shapiro's performance is the very definition of creepy - but the film wouldn't be the same without her. Collette's Annie's slow descent into madness is where the film really comes alive though. It's a steady progression and every look and line can be read in various ways. You'll feel sorry for her until you're terrified of her.There are some horrors, like the recent Truth or Dare or the seemingly unending series of Purge films, where I think it's a tacky genre watched by people who don't really want great films. But every now and then comes a film that saves the whole genre; A Quiet Place, Get Out, It... even Mother! if you count that as a horror (and I certainly do)... and of course Hereditary. This has everything you could want from a sophisticated horror - enough jump-scares to keep it entertaining, an eternal sense of discomfort and dread, shocking twists, a constant mystery and a terrifying climax - and all this from a feature-length directorial debut. Whatever comes next for Aster, let's hope it inherits the quality of this film.",Hereditary
610,3_the_monkey,Drama that makes no real sense,4,21 August 2018,"As a horror it makes no real sense and just leaves you feeling you've wasted your time, as a drama it was pretty good if you like that sort of thing.

Good acting, good drama, poor explanation, sense or ending really, I feel like I wasted my time. Build up (drama) was good though, ending could have been from a different film.

Also, the film is well researched in intelligently places itself in the tradition of Rosemary's Baby, the Omen and the Exorcist, as well as newer films such as the Ritual and the Conjuring. Not only is the film creepy and atmospheric, but at times brutally raw, both in terms of visuals and emotions.I almost missed out on this one, as the marketing made it sound rather boring, but I am glad I changed my mind and gave it a chance.The actors are worthy of mention for their incredibly emotional and believable performances.

624,Grismar,Reminds you of the classics...,8,15 April 2019,"And that's a good thing, if you like the classics like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist or The Omen. It has all the modern updates in terms of visuals, sound design and technology, but it uses the latter in moderation, to its credit. But as a story, in its themes and execution, it's timeless and if you loved those three movies, you're likely to think this one is great as well.If, on the other hand, you grew up on a diet of Saw, Ring and Paranormal Activity, it's probably a bad thing. I've read the negative comments and reviews of many viewers that seem to have a problem with its pace, themes and the type of storytelling that dominated horror in the 70's up to the 00's.There's a number of things in this movie that, if you're used to getting everything served in bite-sized chunks (typically literally), may seem out of place or wrong - but they work very well if you accept the movie for what it is.I think it would be hard to make this movie any better, but I'm sticking with 8/10 because the one valid criticism here is that it *has* all been done before - often. The strong suggestion of a psychological history and the suspense of wondering whether it's all in their heads, the flow of time that leaves out all the mundane and only gets you in the main characters' head space, the supernatural tropes (I won't go into, because that's just spoiling and it's obvious when you see it).The story is well-told, I think the acting is on point, at least as I understand the characters and the movie looks and sounds amazing.

628,mikeburdick,So close to being a classic,7,21 October 2018,"There is so much to love about ""Hereditary."" The acting, particularly Toni Collette and Alex Wolff, is raw and real. The glacial pacing adds to the skin-crawling creepiness. The soundtrack drags you into the depths of dread. And the subtle visual effects are probably the highlight, teasing and toying with the viewer's sense of reality, offering real frights, not just momentary shocks.That said, without giving anything away, where ""Hereditary"" misses the mark for me is by explaining too much. The best psychological horror films, in my opinion, succeed by carefully treading that line between what's real and what's a figment of the imagination-and to be fair, ""Hereditary"" does succeed in treading this line for a good part of the film-however, when it comes to wrapping it up, the ambiguity is either left open, as in ""The Haunting,"" ""Cache,"" or ""The Babadook,"" or answered with a plausible truth, as in ""Les Diaboliques,"" ""The Innocents,"" ""Psycho,"" or ""The Wicker Man."" Personally, I felt the ending was neither here nor there. There's a Netflix show called ""Requiem"" that plays with similar themes, with a more satisfying conclusion.Still, I think this film is entertaining and will satisfy most horror film fans. I'd be extremely suspect of the 1-star reviews, as this is a solidly crafted film with excellent production values, superb acting and insightful writing. As I said, so close...",Hereditary

639,pete-murphy97,A revival of true horror,8,29 January 2019,"Hereditary is gritty, bleak, vivid, tenacious, unforgiving, and at every turn is capable of punishing even the most veteran of horror enthusiasts who thought they'd seen it all - the film graces us with the twists and turns of a truly uncomfortable, bizarre, and contorted horror rarely ever witnessed in the genre.It proves that Ari Aster, both director and writer, is a prodigious talent that has much to offer.The acting was excellent and carried the production into a rawness and tension that forces itself on the viewer; leveraging embarrassment and the repulsiveness of snot, blood, tears coupled with grim expressions of urgency, fear, frustration, disgust, and disbelief.
This is a film with many faces, many layers, and a brilliance in its portrayal of the vicarious, capricious, and evolving tumultuous landscape of human emotions.Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro, Gabriel Byrne, and Alex Wolff all presented a family of distinct characters with motives, emotions, and fully-fledged personalities. Their presentation of ordinary modesty right through to the closing scenes is testament to their excellence.
The film leaves nothing on the table; grabbing at the viewer and pulling them into places they never expected to go.Aster's primary tool is to explore the application of the downright bizarre and strange as an expression of horror. He succeeds.
The shots and content are often abstract, they have the gripping weirdness of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", the eccentricity of Polanksi's ""Rosemary's Baby"", yet the element of stability is never entirely lost; the underpinning soberness and sensibility of Gabriel Byrne's Steve offers this, giving a point of reference and grounding, while making the strange seem that much stranger.
Why is that? Because strangeness is always, at every opportunity, framed in the borders of reality. When flanked by the contrasting elements of realism, bizarre horror is much more compelling and believable. That's what makes this film excellent.I would have preferred an ending less involved in the occult. It is a less accessible ending, but rewards those who follow the details. That being said, it is in keeping with the motif of the unknown; the bewilderment of being lost in the confines of your own home; and even your own body, as the film reveals.This is a stunning horror debut for Aster, 7.8/10",Hereditary
640,jbt1972,Avoid.,4,16 June 2018,"Overhyped, overrated and overlong. Well done to the folk that made the trailer for this film. It's nothing like it. Avoid.",Hereditary
641,ryansalamence,Spiraling,9,10 June 2018,"At its best, Hereditary is amazing, some scenes and sequences are beautifully crafted; no, seriously, the way this movie presents itself is perfect and I doubt (but hope) we're going to see another movie this year with as good of presentation. The camera work during some scenes is great, some shots linger on a characters reaction to an event, rather than the event itself, or instead of turning the camera towards a focal point, they instead follow the characters head as they turn towards it, almost teasing you and it works so so so well. I also LOVED the framing and the way they worked certain figures into the shadows, most dumb horror movies slam a black silhouette dead center, but this is so subtle sometimes that I wonder if there were a few that I missed entirely, and the ones that I did catch were very chilling. All of the acting (except Wolff) was exceptional, both Millie Shapiro and Toni Collette really shine and make this movie what it is, their performances could not have been better and I never once questioned them. This film is unique in so many ways and most of the time really manages to stay away from the dumb tropes from other movies in its genre... most of the time. At its worst, Hereditary has some pretty dumb moments, a few of them, and although typically not immersion breaking, they do drag it down slightly and make me wish they had done something (or anything) differently, a few of those moments falling directly into the cliche scenes it was trying to avoid, and felt like a Paranormal Activity movie. I also feel the movie ruined what could have been a 10/10 ending. Had the final 3 minutes of the film not contained a single spoken word, it would have been outstanding. I'm so upset that they took the route of completely over explaining what was happening and it definitely broke all of the immersion that had pulled me in. In conclusion, Hereditary is a riveting and spiraling film that is definitely the very best in its sub-genre.",Hereditary

Forget that, this is in another league, but because the director is white...well that colour isn't in vogue at the moment (I am not a white person but find the anti white hollywood narrative racist) so we'll move on from that.If you are easily offended (and being as we are living in the 21st century - you probably are) then do not watch this.

I was SO shocked at points, all because I didn't do any research and the trailer is literally just a SNIPPET of the full story- seriously, if you think you know the story off of the trailer, plot twist, you seriously don't.
I think what's great about this film is that it left me with questions, with intrigue and with genuine engagement- I just want to see it again so badly, and I only saw it last night! 
It is 100% scary, at some points terrifying. However I'd say it's more shocking and disturbing that 'terrifying'- however the INCREDIBLE score really makes it hard for this film not to get under your skin, honestly the music in this movie is a 10/10 followed also by the cinematography. Most importantly however, the acting is superb- I was really impressed by Alex Wolff and Toni Collette especially, I think she truly deserves an Oscar nom' for this role.

The story is SO well built, first leading you into the demonic/cult typical plot, but always hinting into what's really going on with that family, until finally revealing itself on the last scenes. You really just have to get involved in the movie, that's all that is requested from any movie goer, not to turn off your brain and be entertained. Hereditary has it all: jump scares, an amazing build-up of tension, deep characters you actually care about, excellent performances (every single actor delivered) and a disturbing story because it's SO REAL. What a great, great movie. If you can't understand the plot or the ending, simply look at the movie's name.",Hereditary
648,Tiny T,To slow to maintain attention,4,9 October 2021,"SPOILER ALERT.This movie went down the drain since the first couple of minutes when I found out the mother was not Famke Janssen. That's just to indicate the moment in the film and no reason for the sorry excuse for a movie this is. I couldn't sit it out to judge the acting as such but allthough it's terribly slow, the acting didn't set me off, it just added to the discomfort. Normally for a good horror flick the surroundings and normal life where it all take place should be so normal that we could relate to it which makes it plausible the horror part could happen to you instead of viewing the far from my bed show. That's where it immediately went wrong when mom and dad forgot to bring an epi pen for the daughters allergy. How irresponsible can you get! No excuse accepted!! And then the idiotic choice to force the daughter upon the 17 year old son by demanding him to take here to a party where the mother seems to expect the son to be drinking but still thinks the kids curfew. And burden the flowering teenager with his LITTLE sister. Nice responsabel action, mom. What could possibly go wrong, oh maybe the epi pen again. Idiots! Ok, the following horror scene in the forthcoming tragedy is probably the only worthy scene in the movie. It's as embarrassing as it is commendable, which says it al.

I don't think I've ever sworn out loud so much watching a movie. I had to stop it once or twice that's how much it affected me. But all the hints they dropped did NOT pay off. They outright mentioned that Annie's mother had D. I. D. And talked about Annie's sleepwalking so much, I was expecting the payoff of this movie to be that Annie ALSO had D. I. D., hence the name ""Hereditary."" I thought sure we'd find that Annie had killed everyone else while being one of her alters. I thought sure that she took on Charlie as yet another alter and it was as Charlie that she committed the remaining murders.

You are more disturbed and on edge hours after the film has ended then while watching (Ok until the third act)This is because at first viewing it is not entirely clear what you just watched. Then you put the puzzle pieces together just like Annie building one of her dioramas. When the scales fall from your eyes and the enormity of the evil - real lust for power - at the cost of all, that you really see what just happened.This is a supernatural melodrama and both ends of the rope burn ever so slowly but with extreme intensity.Aster has made as assured debut as you can as both writer and director. This is no pastiche as he charts an extremely particular vision. Aster makes the house, the lighting, the camera - malevolent bystanders to the growing comprehension of horror. Think about how many horror films you see where you actually don't care who gets killed or not. This is the antithesis of that.How is this a cast for your first film - Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne and Ann Dowd..and they are stood up by the incredible children. The haunting debutante Milly Shapiro and the star in waiting Alex Wolff.The real horror of Hereditary is that you could remove all the supernatural content and it would still be extremely disturbing.",Hereditary
653,sunheadbowed,Hereditary,8,4 July 2018,"('Hereditary' is a film about the conscious, existential suffering of perpetual mystery. We hand it down to our children, a box of secrets wrapped in a black bow, and gift them the opportunity to make sense of what their parents couldn't make sense of. When all you know is the unknowing, there is nowhere to go, it's impossible to evolve, all paths lead to more unknowns. The family tree has dark, piercing roots that spiral down into the ground, darker and darker, deeper and deeper into Hell. We never know where it begins. Who set us on the path?)It's not often that I'm impressed by a modern horror film, but 'Hereditary' was absolutely excellent. It had the intensity and despair of Bergman or Cassavetes, with acting at that impressive level, yet it also boasted the gritty malignancy of the best 70s horror. When I was in the cinema I felt that the audience was unprepared for what they were viewing (even I was, except it was a pleasant surprise to me, since I live for bleak filmmaking), and made deeply uncomfortable because of it, expecting a typically overrated, easy-viewing CGI horror flick and many had to giggle uncomfortably at times -- especially at the ending, in some kind of transparent coping mechanism when viewing a film as suffocatingly bleak as 'Cries and Whispers', which in a sense was a horror film, because real horror lies in what we can relate to, such as sudden death and the near-insanity that comes with grief.Both the cinematography, with its long shots and the pacing were exceptionally good and added so much depth to the experience, which is really unusual for this era; this came across as a film that was made for both existentialist Euro art house lovers and hardcore 70s horror fans, which has been attempted more and more recently, but this one got it right. There are some moments I would have excised, but if you want perfection you aren't getting it in corporate 2018. I have no idea why the marketing has to be, 'the scariest film since the Exorcist', since that's ridiculous and will only serve to unnecessarily and unfairly turn people against the film, but I suppose, 'one of the few modern horror films that genuinely isn't dogshit' doesn't sound as enticing. A near-masterpiece.",Hereditary

655,evrivali,I AM SHOOK,10,25 July 2018,"Wow. I mean WOW. Hereditary was a very hyped movie and my expectations were very high but for the first time I felt like the movie fully met my expectations and was even better than what I imagined.
NEGATIVES
For me there're really not much to say about the flaws of the movie. Maybe it is very disturbing at some points and it has some weird are freakish scenes but to me it wasn't that negative because they contribute to the better understanding of the movie and after all Hereditary is a horror movie and this shouldn't really come as a surprise. Although I think Alex Wolff did a good job in most of the movie there were a scene or two where his acting has leaning more to ridiculous than realistic, of course that's only my impression.
POSITIVES
The first half of the movie is flawless to me. It builds tension and gives us useful information and hints in order to be able to follow what's coming in the second half. Also as much as it concerns the first half the twist was amazing and certainly not predictable so early in the movie at least. The plot leads perfectly to that twist and the scene that it happens is perfectly executed in every way. Now for the second part: It follows the consequences of the twist mentioned before (which I don't want to reveal because the movie is totally worth watching and I don't want to ruin it). During that half the movie evolved from the original and disturbing horror movie that it was to a more cliche and classic horror movie per say but let me explain. When you first see the second half of the movie especially towards the end you will probably ask yourself questions like: 'what in the name of God is going on here?', 'I am completely lost', 'okay this is very weird' but when the credits start to roll and when you start processing what you just saw and taking all these little details that were given to you throughout the whole movie under consideration you will realize that everything that was shown makes perfect sense and that the movie's transition from alternative to classic was not only acceptable but also necessary. If you are confused make sure to make a little research about the movie in order to better understand these things that you maybe missed. It's really important to be able to understand the whole point of the movie since it can be interpreted both literally and symbolically- and I know- the movie is not the easiest to follow but everything you need to know it's there. Also most of the performances were flawless and I really like the symbolism behind Ari Aster's directing work.
CONCLUSION
For me Hereditary was a nearly perfect movie. Although it left me with a very strong and positive impression when I first saw it I really needed to think and research about it in order to fully appreciate it. It might seem weird with the first look but it makes A LOT of sense more than most movies do and for that it requires us to see beyond the haunting pictures and more deeply into the plot. So yeah, I totally recommend it to the lover's of the genre mostly, I am not sure that it would be pleasant enough to people that are not used into watching horror movies. Anyway everything said is my humble opinion and there will be people who will disagree with it but as much as I'm concerned GO WATCH IT.

656,TheDreadedChampion2019,Toni Collette in a career making performance!,8,15 February 2019,"Great little movie. I just watched it for the first time the other day. It's sort of ORDINARY PEOPLE as a horror film. A family that is falling apart from within and then like that's not depressing enough, you add apparitions and and seances and satan. It's not cheap and predictable like a lot of horror films. It's more like The Exorcist, a believable character drama that scares the hell outta you. In the film, Toni Collettes mother has just passed. It is understood she was not close to her mother. Soon after a series of eerie and tragic events unfold that cause the family to fall apart. This movie took unexpected and shocking turns throughout and it is genuinely creepy. Toni Collette gives an incredibly believable tour de force performance that is one of the best I've seen in a long time. But Everyone is great in this film. It's well constructed, takes its time, and really goes to some weird places. Definitely would recommend",Hereditary

But the movie keeps building up suspense and foreshadowing until you get to the end, and *poof*, none of that foreshadowing comes together. Nothing is explains. It just has a random ending and you don't find out why all the other events were connected.
Also, the parents were white and their son clearly was not, and he wasn't adopted because the mother mentioned being preggers with him. I understand he may have been the best actor for the role, but you could've added something to the plot---like he was a sperm donor baby, or a different father, or even have made him adopted---to have it make sense.
Gave it 7/10 because I was entertained for the first hour.",Hereditary
661,ryandannar,Style over substance -- but what rich style!,7,18 June 2018,"""Hereditary"" wants very badly to be a smart, allegorical horror-film. It is gloriously weird, and visually striking to boot -- but it never can quite make up its mind what it's about, and so it ends up being mostly about the fun of watching a really weird movie, for whatever that's worth to you.That is to say, it's a film which tries (but fails) to transcend its genre trappings. Which doesn't make it a bad film -- rather, I'd describe it as a pretty great B-movie of the arthouse-horror sort. It's just kind of a shame that it's not better, because there's a lot of good material here, and much of it is sublimely creepy, thanks to excellent cinematography, fantastic performances, and some very effective sound-design.The story begins as a portrait of an artist and her family, as they recover from the loss of her mother, who lived with them in her final years. Annie, the artist, was never particularly close to her mother; at her funeral, she admits in her rememberance speech that she always found her mother a ""secretive and difficult woman."" A surprising number of people turn out for the funeral, which demonstrates the extent of her mother's secretiveness. That, and frequent appearances of a mysterious rune, clue us in early that ""mother"" might have been involved in some kind of cult.Annie's daughter, Charlie, is a slightly misshapen girl of thirteen, awkward in dress and habit, and suffering from such a keen social disorder that it seems likely she has autism. In the wake of grandma's death, she has taken to sleeping in the odd treehouse in the backyard, where she seems to think Grandma's spirit resides. ""You were Grandma's favorite,"" Annie tells her. ""She didn't want to have anything to do with the rest of us. But you, you were special.""Annie's son, Peter, and her husband, Steve, also figure largely into the story -- but to reveal too much more would be to give too much away.Suffice to say, ""Hereditary"" plays out as a surreal, supernatural Greek tragedy, in which every member of Annie's family will inexorably inherit a curel fate. However, the theme that ""Hereditary"" is most successful at exploring is the way that individual family-members can damage each other, either on purpose or by accident -- and the way those wounds can create lasting resentments and loss of trust. If the film were only about that, it might be a stronger work.But at a certian point, the film blithely introduces certain B-movie horror tropes which just seem goofy when contrasted with the film's more original material. For one, an outrageous ""seance"" scene which moves the film all-too-suddenly into ""Insidious"" territory. For another, well, let's just say that the film devolves into a tale of demonic possession which never quite succeeds at being anything more than the usual tales of that sort.Also, there's a thread about mental illness. Maybe certain characters are mentally ill? And a thread about, ahem, heredity, and what fearful things might be handed down through generations. And when Annie's husband dismisses her suspicions late in the film, is the film trying to say something about female agency? There's a lot going on here. It's not necessarily bad that the film brings up all these notions without delving into each one, it's just frustrating that the film never seems to resolve into a satisfying thematic focus.All of that said, there is undeniable pleasure to be found in watching a film which is as stylistically refined as this one is. The imagery makes bold use of color, which is a far cry from the standard desaturated look of modern horror films. The score careens, unhinged. One character's ""tongue-cluck"" tic is used to nerve-wracking effect. The family's house itself is somehow sinister in its endless number of hallways and doors.And then there's this: Annie, the artist, creates immaculate dioramas of houses, of rooms, of her own house, of personal moments in her life. It would seem that she processes her emotions through the creation of these scale-model simulacrum of her life. The film finds an interesting visual gimmick in exploring these dioramas, and placing us inside of them, only to then reveal that we're looking at the actual spaces. The effect is a distancing one; it removes us from the action; it gives us the sense that the entire film is taking place in dollhouses of one form or another.I feel like that visual gimmick neatly describes both the pleasures and the problems with this film. It's an astonishing visual, but the ""distancing"" effect it creates seems to work to the detriment of the film's action, and for no good reason that I could discern. Why does the film keep comparing full-size spaces with their scale-models? Why do the filmmakers want to distance us? Are we supposed to question the reality of what we're seeing? If so, why? I'm not sure the film provides answers to these questions, or even quite realizes that they're being raised.You see what I'm saying. The film is largely style over substance. But fortunately, style counts for a lot in a horror film, and ""Hereditary"" has that in spades.",Hereditary
662,marcusgrant-86630,Toni Collette Shines in This Horror Tale,7,14 September 2018,"Let's get one thing straight right off the bat - Toni Collette is brilliant and could even make a staged reading from a phone book worthwhile. In Hereditary, she gets probably her best role to date as the struggling matriarch of a very cursed family. Besides Collette, Hereditary has one big thing going for it - unpredictability. Just try to figure out how things are going to play out from the trailer or the first 20 minutes of the movie. I dare you. I can't tell you how refreshing that is in this day and age when one can pretty much gather the beginning, middle, and end of any movie from it's overlong trailer. Hereditary is one of those movies that works better when you go into it with no expectations and no knowledge of what's to come, so I'll keep its many surprises under wraps.

Having seen that film the evening before gave me the patience to sit trough this (not a theatrical viewing!). Having seen both films, my judgement may be clouded. I saw many similarities, that were more effective in the later film.Perhaps closer to an earlier David Cronenberg work than an Early Lars von Trier film, with aspects from neither and yet from both, this is mainly a simple effective horror film.

A chill tauntingly runs along your back while you simultaneously feel a sad knot in the stomach. You know something is going on but can't put your finger on it. The film deceives and throws you off the track. It shocks you and makes you uneasy. As the end draws near it gets creepier and creepier and the horror finally kicks in. It doesnt rely on jump scares - this is a clever flick! Great performances throughout. The cast captures and so does the script - great job from the director to tie this bundle of feelings together into a fantastic film. Some viewers complain about the ending.

Who sends their kid with severe nut allergies out of the house without an EpiPen? (Probably has happened in reality). And then why would the brother try to speed to the hospital instead of calling an ambulance, since they were apparently in the middle of nowhere? (Probably has also happened in reality). And THEN, why were police not involved when the brother accidentally caused the decapitation of his kid sister, left the scene of the accident, and just goes to bed with his sister's decapitated corpse still in the back of the car?! She's then he's just back at school?! A couple of those things are completely illegal, yet not one person in the writing room thought of having even a 10 second scene with police asking questions?

668,MCMCMLXX,Good use of light and stillness....,9,19 June 2018,"...which is what made the film good in its delivery to be nervous to watch. But alas not much of that either for this viewer. It is garnered as a generation The Exorcist, or The Shining, but both have their own style that delivers far better quality. The closest to story for me is similar to Rosemary's Baby, but that was worth merit due to great actors and story (even though the director is an arsehole). Don't worry - there's no spoiler for anyone in that remark. Given some scenes which were great little tense bits (son refusing to look in rear vision mirror, the dark halls with natural feeling light of a moonlit sky) does come across par excellence, but I did snicker at some bits that I'm sure I wasn't meant to snicker at. I also wanted more from Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne - actually, I wanted a lot more from him, but neither were that convincing. Milly Shapiro was just ... ok. The best was the son played by Alex Wolf, but I'm not sure if any of the actors weren't replaceable- which to me says that casting wasn't quite right. I loved the dynamics of the film - top marks for that. Story was so-so, but it wasn't the film I thought I'd like.

671,shabanavdulaj,"I have held Get Out like the best horror film of this past decade, but I'm not sure about that after this fourth watch of Hereditary.",9,9 August 2020,"I consider Hereditary to be more a compelling character drama, rather than a straight-up horror film. Even the way the film is lighted it's not that of a typical horror. In most horror films the lighting is very dark, in order to create a more ominous and treacherous atmosphere, but this film is considerably brightly lit, looking even more like a drama. A drama with horror elements, that don't kick in until the third act of the film.What I like about Hereditary is that it stands out from the usual James Wan horror movie formula we have been used to seeing, loaded with so many jump scares. It's rare to find a horror film where the main purpose of it, it's not scaring the viewer, but telling the story in the best way possible, and if the viewer gets some scary chills along the way, all the better. I like the way the film opens, with the camera creeping into the miniature house, suggesting that there might be something odd going on with that place. It is the perfect way for setting the mood of the film, and this odd and ""unsafe"" feeling we get from those first shots, stays with us for the rest of the road.What keeps this movie together is the directing. The directing it's nothing flashy like it is in, for example, Get Out, but it is bold, it lingers when it needs to, it closes in when it needs to, and it gets uncomfortably close when it needs to (the grief scene). Ari did an amazing job with this film, and he did well with Midsommar also, and now stands alongside Peele and Eggers as one of the best directors when it comes to horror.Aster did great writing and directing the movie, but the one that shines above all in this film is its lead actress Toni Collette. She is phenomenal here, waltzing around and owing every scene she's in. There is one scene in particular that I consider it to be one of the best scenes from this past decade, and it is all because of Toni's outrageous and demanding performance (the arguing scene with Alex Wolff's character). She was like ""I'm going to take a solo now guys, watch me, but try on keeping your jaws off the floor"". And the academy not nominating her was an act of war that everybody let it slide.Hereditary is a gripping horror, it's a challenging film that it's not afraid to take risks. The film ""plays"" with the viewer, changing in between its acts the usual horror elements, from psychological to the supernatural, giving the audience a hard time deciding whether they're watching a harrowing drama or an abnormal horror. But I think that it's always good to trust your public, and I'm glad they decided to do so here. They made some smart decisions in this film and created something truly special, a gem for every film-lover to marvel at.",Hereditary
672,SGuiliano1064972,Stylish Horror!,7,30 June 2018,"This film echoes GET OUT, THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST. Toni Collette gives a Fine performance as well as the whole cast. It centers on a matriarch that has recently deceased and strange occurrences falls on the Family. There is lots of twists to this film and the tension builds and rises.

673,iamMarkPrice,Average horror film or a compelling drama?,4,15 September 2018,"Set in modern day, Hereditary tells the tale of events that set upon a family of 4 following the death of grandmother Eileen. With solid pacing and dramatic cut sequences the editing does it's very best with what are otherwise less than compelling visuals and an overall absence of tention. Scenes tend to either be visually empty or far to visually dense and distracting, with few examples of middle ground throughout. Casting is adequate with performance from Toni Collette that is easily amongst her personal best. Character development is quite strong, with relatable moments and fantastic dramatic subtexts. Humour and symbolism are used well, helping to keep the balance. However, cliches do exist here most notably the use of a Donny Darko style light in a much to overdone and obvious way. This film likewise abounds with foreshadowing making it wholly predictable, which just might be the point. Overall, like those who have come before from A26 a film worth watching once, but probably not a second time.",Hereditary

If you're not Into this emotional stuff it wouldn't touch you in any way and there won't be any scary parts able to compromise that in a positive way.Btw, did not like the ending, that's why I rated it with an 8.

676,longview-77631,Didn't quite live up to the hype,7,2 February 2019,"Here's why I liked Hereditary: It was a well-paced play on ghost stories and darker things, with strong performances by Toni Colette, Alex Wolff, and Milly Shapiro. It held interest and provoked me- hence, just about anyone- through the end. A painstakingly crafted build of intensity is Hereditary's biggest success, also scoring on gore, emotional triggers, and (to an extent) twistiness.Here's why I didn't love Hereditary: It played with domestic turmoil and the supernatural at the same time and never unified the two, nor gave either the full treatment that would have improved everything. Gabriel Byrne played his role like he was on set for an afternoon while his whole on-screen family was writing a textbook for horror acting. I also felt like they left the most interesting plot thread to die on the vine: Annie's job. That dollhouse room deserves its own movie, and that movie would be better than Hereditary.",Hereditary
677,drhoads-93743,Horror Masterpiece,10,9 September 2018,"This has been and will continue to be a polarizing film. Very unconventional horror. In some respects, it does what a traditional horror film aims to do. In other respects, it's a different thing entirely. I went into this film knowing almost nothing. I didn't know about the rave reviews or about the people who hated it. But I found myself intrigued from the beginning.The first thing I noticed was the acting was first rate. I don't mean first rate *for a horror film*. I mean first rate, period. (Even people I know who hated the film admitted that the acting was unbelievably good.) Some have said Toni Collette deserves an Oscar. I TOTALLY agree. But what I found astounding was that all the performances were phenomenal...even minor characters or ones who had just a couple lines. The supporting cast was first rate as well. Alex Wolff was just superb.The next thing I noticed was a sense of evil that permeated every scene. I can't quite point it out. I don't know if it was the lighting, the strange score, the acting...there was just a sense of darkness from the beginning.If you've read about this film, you've probably heard that some people laughed at times. My wife even laughed and she's scared of EVERYTHING. I've been trying to figure out why this is and I think I understand why. First, there is some very subtle humor intended by the director at times. But the main reason is I think the directing is so effective that it makes you uneasy. Many people when they are uneasy will laugh because they don't quite understand what to make of it. And since the horror is so unconventional, ordinary movie-goers can only laugh because the experience is very strange. I don't want to give anything away about the movie. But I'll just say, in reality tragedy isn't like it is in typical movies. Tragedy is strange. Family drama isn't like Hamlet. It's awkward. It makes you uneasy. Emotions are weird. People's reactions to tragedy are weird. Death is incredibly bizarre and we as people don't know what to make of it.I truly, truly hope this film won't be forgotten. And I'm fairly certain it won't be. It's going to be remembered. It's no PG13 popcorn horror. It's emotional horror and spiritual horror. It's pretty hardcore but in probably a different way than you've experienced before.Popcorn suspense moviegoers might be a little turned off by this. Artsy horror fans might just find that this is the Godfather of Horror films.",Hereditary

684,The_Film_Auditor,One of the Best Horror Movies in Recent Memory,9,17 July 2018,"Many ""horror"" films released today attempt to scare audiences by utilizing jump scares that startle the audience for all of 5 seconds. This makes for many of these films to be forgetful since none of the actual imagery or characters are scary, just startling. Hereditary avoids this formula, opting for a much more developed horror story that will stick with audiences long after they leave the theatre.This film lingers in the mind because of a few strong elements that many other modern horror films lack. The first thing that stood out was the slow buildup of the story. The film takes time to develop its characters and build suspense and disbelief. The first act of the film takes the time to develop the backstory and motivations behind the main character, Annie, played by Toni Collate. This helps the viewer grow a connection to Annie, making them more invested as they witness her family spiral into madness.Another aspect of the film that adds to the horror is the acting. Toni Collate in particular delivers an amazing performance as a mother that is driven to insanity. There are many moments in which her character breaks down, and she captures that raw emotion flawlessly. Collate is also surrounded by other great performances from Alex Wolff and a debut from Milly Shapiro who is creepy as hell. All of these performances make the film much more believable, adding to the creepiness of this film.In addition to the acting, the camera work heightens the film's horrifying feel. Instead of the usual quick cuts and crazy camera movements, that many horror movies have, this film goes in the exact opposite direction. The camera lingers on horrifying or uncomfortable imagery slowly panning or zooming. This made me feel as though I was forced to watch. Much like a horrific car accident, all you want to do is look away but you cannot because the camera work draws you in.Overall, this film feels like a horror film from 40 years ago void of jump scares and full of emotional and psychological horror. One small complaint I have about this film is that the ending feels a bit on the nose, trying to explain things it didn't need to. Never the less, this film is one of the best horror films in recent memory. There are still some horrendous scenes I can't get out of my mind.The Good

691,AIOS-Reviews,Don't Watch This Because This is A Masterpiece!,7,9 January 2019,"Here is this little girl named Charlie (Milly Shapiro) with her cute look. She stays with her mother Annie (Toni Collette), father Steve (Gabriel Byene) and brother Peter, (Alex Wolfe). The film starts with the death of Charlie' grand mother (Annie's mom). So Charlie becomes quiet now, she wonders who's gonna take care of her. She used be close to her grandmother.Now this little girl may have a cute face, but her reactions and looks are really scary. As all horror films Hereditary too have some common things like the sky where is no sun, A non city area, there are no neighbors and the rooms are little dark. But definitely Hereditary is not like other horror films, It get it's own class.One day Peter, Charlies brother is about to go to a party and asking if he can borrow a car, so his mother tell him to take his sister to the party. He doesn't want to though. Neither his sister wants to go the party, But their mother managed it. So they are going now by car, charlie on the back seat making a weird sound with her mouth. Her brother Peter may be her brother but they doesn't talk, Charlie is little bit scary. So then they goes to the party the party goes on. Peter goes to smoke weed requesting Charlie to wait a little bit, Charlie says No but somehow stays. Peter goes upstairs, Charlie stars eating a cake and starts feeling she can't breath, her throat is getting bigger, she goes to her brother can't managed to talk. Peter, scared took her to the car, starts driving, Charlie on the backseat trembling, jumping holding her throat. Peter speed up the car to 80 mph. Charlie opens the window, move her head out side the window to take breath from the open air. Peter running car on 80 mph suddenly sees something like a dog in the middle of the road, he scared, moves the car fast, Charlie's head bashed a poster on 80 mile per hour. And that's that. We don't see what happens, the camera is on the face of peter, we don't see what happened in backseat. Peter, scared like hell isn't looking back, After 5 mins he stars the car again. Reach home and went to his bed. At the morning we see peter is not sleeping and we can hear his yelling and crying mother, and then the camera moves to the area where Charlie's head was smashed, and we can see Charlie's head eating by the ants lying in the field, So her mother cried and yelled looking at her half body in the car.That's it. Now I described the scene because I've never so much scared after watching any movie scenes. From this scene it says that the movie is not for everyone. And I'm sorry but any light heart human body can die after watching this. I'm sorry but it's true. The way Ari Aster (the director) made this scene is beyond explanation. The scene has the ability to make anyone believe that they actually see a cut head.This film got 88 on metacritic, now if you follow metacritic and see their top rated movies (Like Manchester By The Sea, Moonlight, Pan's Labyrinth or Boyhood) you will understand how deep these movies are. These movies are always beyond explanation. When you starts watching these you forget that you are watching movie, it becomes complete real. Now when a horror movie becomes real, then it's Hereditary.Hereditary is so scary and realistic that it can make you feel everything is happening in front of you. So watch a horror movie but not a masterpiece horror movie if your heart is weak.Heart stopping direction, masterclass acting, realistic screenplay, depressing cinematography, disturbing story line, everything combines to a deadliest horrific situation.Though the last 10 minutes of the film makes it feel like what was the importance of the movie. But you will realize that later.Which scene I've described above was just the start of the horrific moments, there are much more. I come to watch this movie because watchmojo put it on the no.1 movie of 2018 where no.2 was Avengers Infinty War. And I want to thank you watchmojo.I cut 3 points because, It's depressing and nobody wants to be depressed, and the ending was not as well satisfying.Above all this is so far the best horror movie of the world that has the ability to kill you, I repeat 'to kill you'.",Hereditary
692,Westcoastal,"Excellent, worth seeing, disappointing ending",7,24 August 2018,"I enjoyed this film tremendously. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I was totally blown away by it until the last 20 minutes or so. It is an exceptional psychological thriller that has the right mix of tension, suspense and disorientation, and the long silences helped to intensify those elements. The soundtrack/score for this film is outstanding. One of the best I've heard in any genre, definitely the best I've heard in this genre. The acting is also excellent.

The movie's tagline is: ""When Ellen, the matriarch of the Graham family, passes away, her daughter's family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry."" -- and I wanted to see that movie. The tagline is a lie. The secrets don't start to unravel until you are 90 minutes into the movie, by then you have probably fallen asleep and if not, the secrets are ""meh"".This movie would be OK as a drama about a family descending into madness induced by a series of tragedies. Shoehorning horror into this movie was awkward, and unnecessary. In the very, VERY slow opening 90 minutes there were 2 or 3 remarks that meant little at the time but made sense after the movie concluded -- but it wasn't much, and not really compelling.The first 90 minutes succeeded in making you feel uncomfortable -- with the awkward family and their misfortune, and there were a couple of senseless gore scenes which added nothing to the movie other than allowing them to call it horror. If you want to feel uncomfortable, this will do it. If you want gore, this doesn't have much, if you want jump scares, again, look elsewhere. If you want creepy -- this movie has a bit of that -- but again, it falls more into discomfort rather than truly creepy. They call the end a twist. It wasn't. It was a surprise, I suppose, but not a consequential one.Just don't watch it. Even streaming. It isn't worth your time.",Hereditary
694,Uwontlikemyopinion,"No Jump Scares, I Want My Money Back!",6,14 June 2018,"Annie (Toni Collette) attends an open-casket funeral for her mother. Her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), daughter Charlie, and son Peter try to support Annie during the grieving process. Absent and compartmentalizing her grief through her miniature dioramas, she joins a grief support group. At the support group, Annie vents her anxieties and family secrets which leads to supernatural occurrences and revelations about her mother.The cast is the main asset in this film especially Toni Collette (although I had a rough time understanding why Annie blames herself for so many problems in the movie). Ari Asher's directorial debut establishes strong mood, tone, and atmosphere. The cinematography is minimalistic and naturalistic. The first thirty minutes are wonderfully unconventional and unnerving although not horrific. ""Hereditary"" accomplishes examining themes delving into grief and mental illness. After that it's difficult not to discuss spoilers, I'll try not to give too much away.""Hereditary"" suffers from being an antiplot (narrative uses unconventional plot points to tell story) script with very conventional plot elements. For instance (major spoilers), the first act ends with Charlie being decapitated, Annie looks for more solace at the therapy group which leads her to meet Joan who shows Annie a way to communicate with the dead, Annie communicates with dead, and all hell breaks lose. Pretty conventional story, right? Therefore, the filmmaker uses unconventional means to tell a simple story, which makes the pacing drag and the second act overlong. All this culminates into a disappointing third act. Additionally, the film is negative from beginning to end. It's not nihilistic or depressing, the film is simply tragic, hopeless, and anxiety-ridden. That's not a criticism, but the filmmaker needs to know when to apply breathing room into a narrative to subvert expectations and engage audience members.Finally, try not to see this film during the weekends because many audience members laughed out loud during several moments. Teenagers ran up and down the aisle during scary moments. That's not to say I don't understand this behavior because ""Hereditary"" walks a fine line between comedy and horror, but the filmgoing experience irritates me when audiences demand jump scares or cheap thrills to stay in their seats.

It's been even longer since one tricked me into thinking I was fine only to have me think about it for days and weeks after I'd seen it. Hereditary sticks with you even if you want it to or not.There's no point getting into the plot, because a lot of what makes Hereditary so special are the constant surprises and plot twists. I'll simply state that it's about a family grieving a huge loss and how they fall apart bit by bit. Is it simply just bad luck or are they cursed by someone or something.Hereditary wouldn't work nearly as well if the leading role of matriarch Annie had been played by anyone. Thankfully, the filmmakers were wise enough to employ Toni Collette who's always been one of our best and most dependable actresses. In Collette's capable hands, Annie becomes a pathetic, terrifying, and deeply relatable heroine. It's probably some of the best work of her career.Hereditary possesses some of the most disturbing and creepy imagery of at least the last 10/20 years and it'll really stick with you when you try shutting your eyes in bed at night.

702,LansTaylor,What is there left to be said,8,6 April 2020,"So Hereditary. I've seen this film a handful of times by now and each time I seem to be finding more and more detail throughout the background. The name Ari Aster speaks for itself and he is one fine up and coming film maker.
As a horror movie enthusiast, trails seem to be the death of a movie for me. If i am interested in a film I tend to watch the trailers over and over again to the point where I could theoretically map out the entire movie. But with Hereditary, each chapter offers something way off from what I though was about to happen. Each scene offers something for the audience to grasp at and boy did it deliver.
More on the movie. I LOVE the Kubrick like use of the camera and the style in which we follow the characters from one room to the next; it's very satisfying to watch. The use of darkness really helps seal in the dread of this family as one by one they are being ""sacrificed"". The scene with Charlie (you know the one) was unexpected, like I kept thinking to myself ""no she's going to be alright, theres no way THAT just happened"", and then two shots later we see the aftermath; brilliant. The scariest scene to me was when Annie (the mom) was chasing Peter (the son) up the stairs and into the attic. First of all, Annie came out of nowhere from the shadows of the living room (which might i add, was surrounded by naked people) and started running down Peter. He somehow evades her and closes the attic door behind him. And here's the scariest part, we heard something banging over and over and it cuts to Annie banging her head on the attic door like an 90's metal guitarist. On top of that a few scenes later, we hear some sort of crunching/slushing noise. The camera pans up from Peter and it's Annie floating from the ceiling and working on beheading herself with a piano wire. She starts off slow and works the wire back and forth faster and faster (meanwhile Peter jumps out of the window lol) until her head completely falls off and we hear a thud. That final 10-15 minutes are some of the most intense and horrifyingly graphic piece of cinema I have ever witness and I watch a lot of horror movies.
I cannot rave about this movie enough and I wish horror was more mainstream and appeal to a wider audience.
With that being said, it's a damn shame and a travesty that Toni Collette did not get an Oscar nomination from her terrific acting in this. Her screaming, ""I JUST WANT TO DIE"", hit real deep in me. This is one of the greatest horror achievement this decade and I would even spread it out to this century.
Overall, this is a must see film regardless of genre and has a ton of rewatchable factors. There is so much detail that you miss the first time (or first several times) you see it and it doesn't get old.",Hereditary

Why did he died when the book was thrown by the mother into the fireplace? Who's the half-naked man standing at the door in front of the son? If the demon wants the son to die, why don't the demon just possessed the son and get himself killed?

706,sugarnspices,Forgettable,5,3 October 2018,"I saw this movie a month or so ago, so it's not fresh on my brain. I do know what stood out to me and what I thought in general of the movie. Spoilers and Thoughts Below:Toni Collette is such an amazing actress. I have always loved her and her work, she can do lighthearted to funny to terror. Sixth Sense? I mean, c',mon. Anyways - I was SUPER excited when I saw this move was coming out and starring her. I heard it was one of the creepiest/scariest movies in recent years (I know, I know, we hear that all the time) but Hereditary and Conjuring are the only ones in my recent memory where a substantial amount of people/critics made those comments, and judging by trailers, I could see it having that potential. I thought Conjuring was pretty dang scary, so had high hopes for this movie as well. I will say that the scene in the car and the little sister dropped my mouth to the FLOOR and it stayed there for a good 1 /12 minutes. They GOT me there, it was a good shock. It's rare a movie can make my mouth literally drop, props on that! I did find it ridiculous that the boy would then just drive home and go to bed. I know shock. I've been there. Can I say I've taken off my little sister's head with a light post? No. But I find it VERY hard to believe that you would be that shocked you go home, go to bed, lay there all night (awake) basically waiting for your parents to find the headless body in the backseat. Not to mention, where were the cops involvement? That would probably be pretty heavily investigated, yet there is no mention of the boy being interrogated or even having one sit down with them. I also found it pretty hard to believe you would then send your kid back to school right after that. I think that would take some INTENSE therapy and some time off of school/work. Back to Toni, she did a STELLAR job portraying the mother/daughter that has lost her ""crazy"" distant mother and her different daughter she wanted so badly to bond with. The scene at the dinner table where she loses her crap on the son was so amazingly done, you felt like you were sitting at the table in all its awkwardness and raw pain. The woman can act! I thought the ending was stupid. Stupid. STUPID. Don't even get me started on headless Toni floating up to the tree house, LOL - WHAT? I realize the headless thing was a theme: the bird, the daughter, dead g-ma in the attic, Toni while possessed, but what did that have to do with the idol they were worshiping in the tree house? Also, whose head was that on the idol? Why did they all have to be headless for a guy with a head to take the ""thrown?"" I also think they could have done a better job building up/explaining the witch/devil worshiper mother and her followers. I did like how they threw the grandma's friend in there to befriend Toni - but I wish they would have built more up to it and had more details and focused more on it, since that is what the movie ended up really being about. I did think it was ""clever"" to have it actually be the boy they wanted for the demon, and early on in the movie the daughter (whom the Grandma was closer to) said the Grandma always wished she was a boy. Seeds planted, just didn't give them enough water to grow and be appreciated.Overall, I gave this movie a 5 on Toni's sheer acting capabilities alone. I think it had some good/creepy parts, but overall, the movie is and will be totally forgettable.",Hereditary

709,reviewerB,No suspension of disbelief whatsoever,5,24 August 2018,"SPOILER ALERTWhy did they cast the Wolff brother for the role of the son?!?! Why on Earth cast a guy that looks like he's 25 in real life, to play a role of a 16 year old, who screams like he is 5?!?! I've read reviews praising the acting on this film but I totally disagree with those. Some scenes are so nonsensical (even in a paranormal setting) that even Collette, who is an amazing actress, could not do the trick. Byrne acts like an expressionless robot. But Alex Wolff really takes the cake when it comes to pathetically faking fear. It's laughable when he shrieks and cries, saying ""I'm so scarred"" and calling his mother ""mommy"" as if he was 5. I thought that would later be explained, like ""oh he's actually 5 and she was dreaming that he was 16"" or something like that. But no, it's just plain bad acting. And how about the last scene? I thought he should look a little more empowered, right, since he became a demon. Or maybe that's when he should act more childlike, since he became Charlie. But no. There was no change in his expression, body language or persona. Miscasting that totally compromised suspension of disbelief, IMHO.Pace is also much slower than necessary. If it was supposed to create tension, for me, it only created boredom. Definitely NOT the scariest movie of the year. Actually it did not scare me at all.",Hereditary
710,drawnsupreme,Get this garbage outta' here!,1,31 December 2018,"Hereditary is your typical distraught family, with the typical distraught kids, tied with the typical ghost possession story, sprinkled with a few special effects that try to make you gasp. I've seen it all. Seems like every ""horror"" movie nowadays copies this same exact formula. One of these characters is probably possessed. Woopty-doo!Hereditary brings NOTHING new to the table. If you've watched films like The Exorcist, The Omen, or The Conjuring, for example, you'll notice how Hereditary tries to copy elements of those films, and many others.The best way to describe the tone of the movie would be monotonous, which also makes the pacing of the movie feel very slow.The movie attempts to build up, with random little events happening throughout, some actually LAUGHABLE - and actually finishes up with one of the DUMBEST and UNDERWHELMING endings to a movie that I have ever seen in my life.Everyone was hyping Hereditary up, claiming it was one of the scariest movies as of late - but this is pure nonsense. With an open mind, I sat through the movie but I just did not find it disturbing nor frightening in any way. Instead, I found it unoriginal, boring, and over-hyped by ""casual"" horror fans.

714,tylerkom,"A great technical achievement, not a masterpiece",7,28 October 2020,"Hereditary is a great technical achievement in filmmaking...but a great film itself I'm not so sure. Everything is right here - it's the type of film that you might turn in for your final project of film school. Of course, it's infinitely more polished than that, but the sentiment holds. Its cinematography is wonderful, the shots are picked beautifully, and the pacing is just right for the genre. My technical qualms with the film are minor. Firstly, the dialogue is sometimes a bit unbelievable, especially what some of the teenagers say. We were all teenagers once, I don't understand how hard it is to write teenage dialogue. Secondly, although the characters are largely logical, some of the decisions made were not the best (even out of a horror film situation).I'll be honest and say that I think the horror genre in filmmaking is quite weak. This is usually because it is hard to suspend disbelief when characters are illogical (which so many horror films rely on). Hereditary makes the type of scary that makes you uncomfortable but doesn't try to do anything more than that. It doesn't explore human nature or try to touch on what primally scares all humans It's not The Shining or some other art film. Hereditary is the best version of the cheaper kind of horror - and it's pretty good.",Hereditary
715,CriticalRaccoon,"A Good, Somewhat Familiar Haunting",7,7 July 2020,"I'm unsure how I'd feel about ""Hereditary"" had I not read all the hype around it. The hyperbolic statements calling it a generational horror movie created an awfully high bar of which to be judged. As a fan of horror cinema, my interest was quite piqued. As a person expecting the best, I was left wanting.""Hereditary"" is the much-loved and much-talked-about supernatural domestic horror film by writer-director Ari Aster that at times feels like a refined version of a 70s supernatural thriller, while at other times is a familial drama about grief. It got glowing reviews calling it a modern classic. I saw it long after the hype had died down and was left wondering what exactly it was that made this movie stand out so much.As we open to the funeral of the family matriarch Ellen Leigh, her daughter Annie (Toni Collette) delivers a eulogy riddled with hints as to the troubled nature of this family. Annie is a miniatures artist who seems to use her art to tell her own personal (disturbing) trauma. Annie's 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) is especially devastated as she had a deep relationship with her grandmother, to the point of feeling like Annie wasn't capable of raising her at all. Their older child Peter (Alex Wolff) was kept away from Ellen due to Ellen and Annie's fraught relationship, and spends his days doing drugs. Oh, and Annie's husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is, um, around? Seriously Steve is barely a factor in this movie.The family is clearly messed up in many ways. Annie lies to her husband about going to the movies in order to go to a bereavement group where she reveals that most of her family suffered from severe mental disorders and fears she'll suffer from them too. Peter just wants to party and get high while avoiding everyone. Charlie cuts the head off a dead bird and sticks it in her pocket as she crafts figures using the dismembered animal part, and draws disturbing images as she's tormented by some sort of light on her walls. Steve, um, exists.That's about as far as I'll take the plot as the rest would instantly spoil most of what drives this movie forward. Needless to say, it goes into dark territory.First and foremost, ""Hereditary"" would be nothing without Toni Collette. Collette gives this movie everything she has, and it's impossible to think about ""Hereditary"" without her. She brings Annie to life, and her descent into madness is both organic and riveting. She starts off as a frustrated and tired mother, but ends off in this manic ""you've got to believe me even though I sound crazy"" tone that propels this story from beginning to end as she slowly unravels the events occurring around her. The rest of the cast are secondary to Annie, and all scenes without her are pretty much just filler in my books.Part of the absolute focus on Annie being the emotional linchpin of ""Hereditary"" is that all the other characters suffer from a lack of screen time. Peter's scenes where he's supposed to be terrified have no weight because we don't really get to know him at all beyond his dealings with the supernatural, and I just never managed to feel invested in his character at all. Charlie's an interesting mystery but that's about it - her disturbed state is permanent and unchanging. Steve is just there to fill the realists' role and honestly Gabriel Byrne looks like he wants to be anywhere else than in this movie. When other characters outside the family show up they are either completely flat or ""they are obviously evil why is no one in the family seeing this"" territory.Performances are just one part of the layers of fear here - ""Hereditary"" is a master class on visual oppression. There is rarely a shot in this movie that isn't trying to unsettle you in some way. The lighting, camera, and even the color choices are all meant to make you feel like something is off. Aster loves the long, slow shot that makes you get drawn into the frame only to wish you could be anywhere else. To go along with this the soundtrack also at times is overbearing in its attempts to get under your skin, especially in the first act. Ari Aster knows how to manipulate the audience without saying a word, and to some that will be enough.Now, I know I just said that this was an incredibly unsettling movie, but it also feels forced at times. There isn't a moment that is allowed to be, well, natural. Everything about ""Hereditary"" is harsh. I personally find it too much and takes away from the moments that are supposed to be shocking. Aster never sets the dial below an 8 for this entire movie, so when the climax ramps it up to 10 it just doesn't leave the impact I think that it should have. It's also about 15-minutes too long; the long buildup to the climax loses some oomph. It's in those final moments that the leaky plot starts to sink under the weight of its own mythos as the pieces get slapped together rather than falling into place. I just feel that if it had instead gone for a level more akin to Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" it might have been more successful in what it was trying to do, at least for me.The thing that left me most intrigued with ""Hereditary"" was not the actual horror aspects of it, but rather the fact that Aster made a family/parenthood drama that just so happened to coincide with supernatural events. The supernatural forces at times are like adding Swiss Cheese on an already delicious hamburger. Her relationship with her children is disastrous to say the least, and reflects on how horrid she feels her mother treated her - the fact that evil forces surrounds them is barely relevant to the drama. No matter who you are, some part of you can relate to the people in this family. Well, other than Steve, unless you relate to someone not wanting to be there. These different elements however create some odd tonal shifts when flipping between the supernatural and the familial, but by grounding the story in a frame most people can relate to Aster did at least cement his movie as being timeless.""Hereditary"" is not for everyone and can easily disappoint those looking for a film in the vein of what usually passes for horror these days. It's an old-school horror movie that's built on dread and tone rather than jump scares and gore. Ari Aster spends almost as much time in supernatural suspense as he does on family drama. It also got hyped so much that I honestly felt like the critics ruined the movie watching experience; hyperbolic statements saying ""Hereditary"" is this generation's ""The Exorcist"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"" didn't help much either (I'm looking in your direction too, ""The Babadook"").While I admit that there are a lot of good things about ""Hereditary"", I was just left wanting. It's a better version of a lot of movies that came before it - specifically a lot of 70s and 80s low-budget horror movies - but it's supernatural story is a bit too familiar at times. I know some claim it's the best horror movie of a generation; I was left wishing it had more to set it apart.""Hereditary"" easily is among the better made horror movies of the decade, but I just felt like it lacked the identity that it needed to make it stand among the greats. In terms of other recent horror flicks I'd rank it under the likes of ""The Witch"" or ""It Follows"" - movies that had their own uniqueness to them - though ""Hereditary"" is miles above ""The Babadook"" (seriously, I hate that movie). If it wasn't for Toni Collette ""Hereditary"" would be easily forgotten, but her dedication elevates the product to places its run-of-the-mill setup would languish in. If you want to see a good, somewhat familiar horror movie then ""Hereditary"" is an easy recommendation; those wanting something more will be left wanting.",Hereditary

718,mtrburrows,Confused but effective,7,12 November 2020,"Many people hold up ""Hereditary"" as the modern day exorcist, and it's easy to see why. With fantastic performances, direction, and cinematography, the film did a perfect job at making me feel unsettled throughout. While the typical Hollywood scares, like seeing a Ghost in the dark, or having a gravity defying antagonist, were really few and far between, what makes Hereditary a film worthy of its spot as a top rated horror is the tension strung throughout as the cast perform (almost) flawlessly the downfall of spirit and hope of the main family.Every element of filmmaking works completely symbiotically in the first two acts of the film to represent dread, hopelessness, and a continuous fear in the audience that the film is going to take these characters down a very dark path. From the cliché-dodging dialogue that makes these characters feel real, to the Oscar-worthy performance by Toni Colette, and to the ambiguous score.While the first two acts are nearly flawless, where the film lost some merits for me was in the final act. The reveal at the end is that the family is being manipulated by a demon worshipping cult, and that reveal not only felt underwhelming because this demonic entity has no presence or mention in the first two acts, and we don't even know what it wants or is capable of, but also confusing. The film doesn't seem to be able to decide whether the force to be reckoned with here is a paranormal, or human threat. We see cult members haunt Peter in the final scene, but are these real people, or do they possess some sort of superhuman power that allows them to influence incidents and appear wherever they want? The imagery is undeniably unsettling, but the lack of explanation of what any of it means (which was effective in the first two acts) grew frustrating and tiresome by the end, and the final moment of Peter being crowned fell completely flat for me. What does this mean? What is Peter going to be made to do? What's the goal? Can this entity just do anything it wants? The moment this frustration with wanting to know the rules began was when the father went up in flames with the book - how did that happen? Can the entity just do ANYTHING it wants now? I thought it was only linked with Annie and Peter?The slow pace only enhanced this frustration in the final 30 minutes. Throughout the film the meandering shots created a feeling of mystery, realism, and therefore tension, but when it boils down to it, the final confrontation consists highly of Peter walking very slowly, seeing something which is very slowly revealed, and very slowly reacting to the horrors around him. It's a great technique when used sparingly, but the final act should have definitely been cut down.Despite the confused and meandering conclusion, Hereditary should be celebrated highly for its use of psychological horror and character descent into madness. Future horrors could definitely learn something from this!",Hereditary

It was all about weird family dynamics and the unseen. I liked that, even though I didn't know where this was going. It was promising. This culminated in one gruesome event. Afterward, the movie devolved (IMO) into a waste of my time. It was too slow and it seemed like the creators didn't know where this was leading to. If the movie had done something with that promising start, my rating would be higher. As such it is, my rating is just 6 our of 10 and the latter part of the movie is definitely worse than 6 stars. Yeah, it's all explainable, but it was not scary anymore, except for that school scene (possession). That was well done. There were too few scenes like this.Watch Rosemary's Baby for a much MUCH better film about sort of similar stuff.The daughter looks really weird and out of place and people would react to her differently than they did in the movie. Examples are the school party and that stuff with the pigeon in the schoolyard. The son and daughter also looked in no way like each other, even though they're supposed to be family. Maybe that's just me. Whatever. It's just a movie and in the end not a classic. The relationship between the father and mother is also crazy and to me looks unrealistic. It had not enough depth.Have fun watching it. It's kind of disturbing. It's messed up.",Hereditary
722,Krush_Burner,"It is creepy, suspensful and intelligent family horror story",9,3 June 2018,"This film is a successful horror at several levels. The screenplay contains at least two different basic aspects, each of them are intersting on its own, but writer and director Ari Aster is able to fuse it into a powerful but standalone story, using not your average jumpscares but a great suspense-building.
On the surface ""Hereditary"" is rather a family drama than horror, the whole storyline focuses on a members of one family with dark past. Toni Colett does a great acting here, and truly sparks the screen. The film invests a lot in characters, since it's only a handful of them here, so don't expect immediate drive into the ghosts activity or demonic posession. It's a film about dissolution of a one particular famliy, and such process Asters shows with great attention to the details. There's no direct social commentary here, it's rather about personal degeneration and desperation, about the past that still haunts.
Under all this dramatic surface lies great modern horror, made with respect to classical themes and style. As story goes by, transition from family drama to occult horror begins, and Aster manages to procced it smoothly. A lot of traditional horror elements (such as disturbing dreams, bizarre rites, and so on) can be found here, but this film relies more on the of tension and eerie logic of the events than on conventional jumpscares or blood and guts. 
Overall, it's a great slow-burner, made with all respect to genre fans, and luckily escaping most of the cliches - a rare film among contemporary horror films. if you like dark and nervous movies with acting over SFX, put this one on your watch list.",Hereditary
723,regexfan,Good movie EXCEPT for the last 10 minutes,6,3 November 2018,"It's hard to rate this movie. The movie runs for 2 hours. The first 1 hour and 50 minutes was really good, I mean, REALLY good. About an hour in, I thought to myself, this is a really good movie, something really different than what we're used to, a horror movie that is not just about scaring its viewers. Good acting by Toni Collette, nice cinematography, good writing and directing, good buildup, unconventional scares, no jump scares at all. Because of that, I was hoping for the ending to be different, to match the buildup and setup it prepares the viewers. But I was let down.The last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie shows us nothing original, nothing you have never seen before in many horror movies. This kind of ending has been done to death for decades, I was sorely disappointed. The little ""twist"" in the final moment seemed like something the writer had to come up with to make up for the weak third act.This movie reminds me of House of The Devil, another slow burner type of horror movie which was really, really good until they ruined it in the third act. What can I say, I guess coming up with a strong ending is really hard, especially for horror movies. Maybe that's why most prefer to play it safe and keep horror movies simple. Maybe ""simple"" works better for horror movies anyway.",Hereditary

The last 20 minutes are where the only real edge of your seat stuff comes along, but even that's ruined by the ending.

I bit the bullet and gave it a whirl at home. I was not disappointed. Everyone turns in a stellar performance. Milly Shapiro didn't have much to do except say weird stuff, act as a slightly mentally disabled kid, and make that absolutely annoying sound. And she does it masterfully.The tense atmosphere of a fractured family just blends so well with the horror dynamic. And the directing? Exquisite. The camera movements were so precise as to be almost unnoticable, a la Coen Brothers. The scene trasitions were perfect, and the cinematography spot on.The writing excels too. The story does drag a bit but that is definitely part of the agaonizing suspense generated by the story and the characters. Charlie's death takes you by surprise, and as the whole mess further unravels you are drawn into the darkness and dysfuntionality. Fear, blame, guilt, arrogance and regret, the director just goes there, and then overwhelms you with the evil and twisted denouement. Special effects are used tastefully and masterfully; the scene where the mother floats past behind her son's back is truly unsettling.

Hereditary, directed by NYC native Ari Aster and distributed by the now infamous A24 pictures, also responsible for modern cult horror flicks like 2015's, ""The Witch"" and 2017's ""It Comes at Night"". It's quite easy to see this film being compared to movies like The Witch and even classic horror like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, as there are MANY similar thematic elements of familial bonds estrangement, mental illness, and the occult. I won't spoil it for you, but trust me, if you watch this film expecting a typical run of the mill horror film like ""Happy Death Day"" or ""Truth or Dare"" kindly look elsewhere, because this is completely different territory which can truly be called a horror movie for adults instead of teenagers.

There's no atmosphere, character interaction, supporting characters or anyone to care about. The silly last scene explains little, and 1967s Eye of the Devil had the same basic revelation.

The first half of the movie is dreadfully boring and way too long. If you must see this movie go halfway through and you won't miss a thing. We should be paid to go see this movie. Scariest movie of the year? I would say toys story two is scarier. I was literally confused at how the husband was set on fire, how the mom was climbing the walls while the whole time there's a random dog in the movie. What was with the bird getting his head chopped off and running into the window. And if the little girl was such a big part of the movie why did they kill her off so quickly. I have so many questions but I really don't care about the answers because this movie was so horrible. Is there an option to get it no stars?

749,pachomar84,"EXTREMELY Overrated (summarized plot, spoilers galore)",1,6 July 2018,"Ok, so I was so looking forward to watch this, since the critics in Sundance called it ""The Excorcist"" of our era, so much people rated it like the best horror movie in years, an so on. So, I watched with really high expectative. Here's what I saw:
We have a family of mother, father, son and daughter, who start the movie in the grandma's funeralGrandma liked to do small models of houses, rooms, people and stuff (or did she? it's not completely clear, but it's the only reason that would explain the movie title, since that's the only thing the mom has in common with the grandma)We are introduced to the weird looking daughter, who likes to chop dead pigeon's head (only one, not like she had a collection or something)Weird daughter doesn't have friends, she sleeps in a tree-house for some reason, and has a couple of visions of her dead grandma (nothing really scary, just some kind of light that hints?The son wants to go to a high-school party and mom forces him to take the daughter, you know, cuz she doesn't have friends and doesn't want his son to drinkSon doesn't drink but gets high, and the daughter eats some chocolate cake that creates an allergic reaction (daughter is allergic to peanuts)Son, high af, rushes her to the hospital we guess, instead of calling 911. Daughter is choking in the back seat so she opens the window to breathe and, in a very ""unpredictable"" way, the son has to avoid a crash, accidentally making the girl lose her head against a pole (this one was a bit surprising, I thought the girl would have a bit more protagonism seeing the trailers)Mom grieves her daughter and goes to a group therapy to cope with it, where she meets a nice lady who lost a son and a grandsonSaid nice lady tells the mom she went to a medium and could talk to her grandson. She invites mom to her house and demonstrate that it is true (using a glass and a chalkboard)Mom tries to contact the dead daughter, with her husband and son, and succeeds, but daughter's spirit seems to be kinda pissed (a glass is break during the medium session, so we guess)Dunno if it's relevant, but mom sleep-walks, and we are told that once she woke up having his son covered in gas and her having a light up match in the past (ok?)Son starts having hallucinations, not creepy ones (he sees himself into a glass smiling at himself. The most serious one has him half body paralyzed in his class and smashing his face on the table)Mom hears sounds and goes to the attic, only to find a body, which she presumes to be the grandma (it has no head so we don't know). She asks her husband to go check it. Honestly the husband is the only real character we see in the movie ""Why didn't you call the police?"" he asks, and mom sets him on fire (?)Previously, mom found a photo album of her mother (grandma) in which the nice lady who thought her to contact the death shows up (was she a ghost?, she knew her from before?, what were they up to?)The only ""mystery"" is when the mom finds a page on one of grandma's books talking about ""a demon who has to posses a male body"", cuz the demon is male....)After mom sets husband on fire, she goes after her son, who's still confused (as we all are I guess) of wtf is happening. He hides himself in the attic until mom appears hanging in front of him while stabbing herself to deathSon leaves the house and goes to the tree-house were the dead sister used to sleep. He finds himself with bodies with their heads covered up by bags, and a voice saying he's the incarnation of the demon they were waiting for (apparently, the dead sister was the first incarnation, but since she was female, she had to die)Son, confused af, is being praised from the bodies, still with heads covered by bags, celebrating for the ""incarnation""Camera goes away showing the scene as if it is some kind of closure, and credits rollHonestly, this is the longest review I ever wrote, but I feels that the disappointment I felt after watching this deserved it. Who in hell is saying this is the new ""Excorcist""? It doesn't have the horror, the tension, the disturbing scenes (the most disturbing I saw was the 3 seconds of the dead sister's head on the road covered by ants, and it wasn't as disturbing as seeing the possessed girl using a crucifix on her ""private parts"", scene that still haunts me nowadays). Honestly, this movie tried to do a lot and didn't really delivered on anything. I guess that if a horror movie doesn't rely on jumpscares nowadays its supposed to be good, but this wasn't the case. I hope this review helps other viewers",Hereditary
750,josephbrewster-88279,"I went in blind, and loved it",8,26 March 2019,"I had not seen trailers or heard hype regarding this movie, but I do enjoy horror, so I took a chance.I was surprised by how tense and uncomfortable the movie made me feel. There was a pervasive oppression in the way it was shot and edited, with actors delivering believable and difficult to watch performances. Some of the emotional scenes were gut wrenching, and over all, the lead roles were solid and intense.Despite a few jump scares, I didn't feel the movie relied on cheap tricks to incite fear. Yes, it contains some cliches of the horror genre, but I did not find them distracting.If anything, I felt the pacing began to lag in the third act. There was a moment when I asked myself ""wait, is this another slow turn shot from behind?"" And felt it was overplayed.Overall, this delivered the sort of fright-inducing, disturbing experience I rarely get from a horror movie. It called to mind movies like the Babadook and the exorcist.It certainly is to taste, and there will be others who pan it for the same reasons I enjoyed it, but if you like movies such as Rosemary's Baby, Mother! or VVitch, I think you will come away more than satisfied.

751,vegeta-julian,"Amazing horror, spoiled by a single big plothole",7,20 March 2019,"This was one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time. The horror and suspense you feel are not from jump scares, which makes it so awesome. The acting is great and the story something fresh and exciting.However, what got stuck with me even days after watching it was not the creepiness and horror, but being puzzled about one giant plothole:
The death of Charlie.
For Charlie to die was a vital and important point in the plot and for the cult. The cult is pretty good at manipulating and orchestrating their plot from the shadows, but orchestrating Charlies death was really a long shot for them that could have gone different in so many ways and it just doesn't sit well with me that it happened just like they wanted it to. A lot of things they couldn't influence had to go right for this.
1. Annie had to send Charlie to this party
2. Charlie had to eat nuts
3. Peter had to evade the deer to the right, not to the left
4. Peter also just had to come close enough to the pole for the head to be ripped off but not drive into it and end up in a fatal crash
I can see how point 1 and 2 could be arranged by manipulating some people in the surroundings, but 3 and 4 would really be out of their control and they would really have to keep their fingers crossed for that to happen as they would like it to. And that's what spoiled the movie a bit for me, I just don't buy that part.",Hereditary

Seems like it was written with the same level of focus that a 5 year old has when they're telling you a story & some part are just nonsense & other parts you just don't care about or aren't related to the main plot.

It doesn't break the usual stereotypes of the genre, but gives them a new touch with a bit of originality and cleverness. With the visually stunning lightning the movie successfully presents its inner tone and with the cliches of the genre it keeps the form that so many viewers are seeking and enjoying. The performances are good and with the help of clever editing tricks the film becomes incredibly atmospheric. If you expect an entirely new set of plot elements that you've never seen before don't watch it.

759,TheReelMovieMaven,A house of horror... and horrible housekeeping,2,2 July 2018,"The real horror in this film is the home decor and ultimate trashing of a beautiful house in the woods. Oh, and a teenage boy who spends too much time in his messy bad, sleeping in this dirty clothes.
Seriously, the only redeeming feature in this movie was the performances (except the teenage boy, who gave a one-note performance, though that probably was not so much his fault as the director's). Otherwise, this ""Rosemary's Baby"" + ""The Witch"" derivative had little to offer except yawns (the movie is way too long for such a slight story) and a few cringes at gratuitous gore and cadaver dummies. It was a bit fun looking for the ""clues"" to the story's meaning sprinkled throughout, but, in the end, they didn't add up to much. 
And here's a tip: As soon as the movie is over, bound out of your seat and head for the exits, lest Judy Collins singing ""Both Sides Now"" over the credits reduces you to violent giggling.
I gave this movie two stars: One for Toni Collette's heroic performance (it takes guts to act good in a film this bad; and one for allowing me to sit in an air conditioned movie theater for over two hours on a sweltering day.",Hereditary

761,Miasmakoala,Intense yet flawed,4,15 June 2020,"Midsommar was a solid movie (7/10). I also enjoy the other modern horror movies that are often mentioned along with this movie (The Vvitch, It Follows, It Comes at Night, The Lighthouse), so I was pretty excited to finally see Hereditary.The movie starts with the funeral of Annie's mysterious mother and continues into their family's life after that. Every scene looked good and the eerie atmosphere was great as expected.However at the 30 minute mark or so the movie got pretty annoying.Charlie, the youngest daughter, wanders off into the woods to see the grandmother surrounded by a circle of flame. The scene ends abruptly when Annie takes her back to home and asks for Peter, Charlie's older brother, to take Charlie into a party with him.If Peter had been a normal human being he would have probably said that he can't take the 13 year old kid into a party. He just looks apathetic and takes Charlie with him though he clearly didn't want to take her. That's dumb but okay.In the opening scene it was revealed that Charlie has a nut allergy and of course it's relevant to the plot, why would they tell details like that otherwise. In the party Charlie ends up eating cake that has peanuts (they even show a girl chopping peanuts, jeez) and Peter has to take Charlie into a hospital. Don't know why she doesn't have an EpiPen with her.When Peter is driving Charlie sticks her head out of the back window, only to get decapitated by a pole because Peter had to dodge a dead deer. I was laughing so hard at this scene, holy smokes. After that Peter just drives home and leaves the headless body in the car to be discovered by his mom and that's supposed to build up the family's tensions even more.The party and the accident felt so forced that it took me completely off the movie. In the end it's revealed that Peter's grandmother was a witch or Satanist or something and they were preparing Peter to be a vessel for Charlie / King Paimon.The last 30 minutes were really intense and I wanted to enjoy the movie overall, but the main conflict is built on a premise so ridiculous that I couldn't relax and enjoy the movie. I did laugh a lot, but that wasn't what I was expecting.The accident was apparently based on a real life accident. It is so distracting and forced, I think it'd been equally silly if Ari Aster had taken any other ridiculous one in a billion accident and made it a major story element.The parent's actors were great but the kids were a bit shallow. Both of them just had the same expression throughout the movie and felt like they were just trying to react at the silly stuff the script threw at them.It's not a bad movie but I was expecting a lot more.",Hereditary

It so cleverly pieces together the story into a gut-wrenching 2 hours and I wish it was even longer. The eerie music and akward camera movements are just brilliant, as is Toni Collette. This performance is so much better than her performence in ""The Sixth Sense"", she is just amazing. The cast is phenomenal, especially the actress who plays Charlie. I never see movies twice in the theater, but I went back to watch this a second time because it was just so genius. 10/10 would recommend.",Hereditary

If you didn't know you were watching a supernatural horror you would only get a clue when the first death occurs some way in. I thought it had a sense of a few older movies from the sixties and seventies about it such as Rosemary's baby and Don't look now. Things only get supernatural towards the end and if you haven't been following the story well enough you may end up confused about how, why and who. If you are a fan of films about the occult then this is one to watch.",Hereditary

Never in my life, i felt this terrorized by a movie. Saying to myself that it was all fake it didn't help. It felt so real, and it gripped me with real fear, not shallow one given by lame tricks like jumpscares. 
Everything in this movie is masterfully crafted to transmit this feeling of unease and dread and hell i felt it. It really got to me and i'm sure it will stick for quite some time. 
I'm not sure i'm happy about that.",Hereditary

WTH,1,23 August 2018,"SO this is my first movie review ever and I had to write a review on this so called ""most terryifying movie since the exorcist"" what a load of nonsense! Are these movie critics on crack or something? The movie is so long and dragged on for no utter reason, no actualy supernatural events takes place, nor is it scary. I would class this movie more as a psychological movie.When i heard about this film, i was very excited, thinking ""finally a movie worth to watch"" however, i was left versy disappointed by the end of the movie. If only i could get back the time wasted watching the dreadful movie, if only! Note to movie critics - stop smoking crack!",Hereditary
769,isaacj02,Toni Collette is astounding in Ari Aster's chilling horror debut,9,20 January 2019,"Hereditary is a film that divided critics and audiences alike, with some giving it a lukewarm response and others heralding it a modern-day Exorcist. What is unarguably brilliant about this film however is its central performance in an utterly entrancing Toni Collette, well worthy of awards talk. Collette plays Annie Graham, a contemporary artist grieving over the death of her estranged mother, whose family become entangled in the supernatural after she explores the infamous practice of the séance. What slowly unfolds is a terrifying film, that grips you to your seat. To reveal much more about the plot of Hereditary would do this film a disservice; writer-director Ari Aster, even in his debut feature, shows himself to be a maestro of unexpected filmmaking that echoes of horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, yet feels alarmingly fresh and truly horrifying. The narrative of Hereditary slithers and turns slowly, expertly paced and nail-bitingly tense. It must be said that the movie is not devoid of horror tropes; what saves this occasional sink into cliché is the abundance of shocking twists in the plot and the deeper meaning behind the film. For Hereditary is not just a standard supernatural horror, but also a telling meditation on grief and mental illness. This is shown through a stand-out performance from Toni Collette, whose face alone tells of a woman truly going mad in her own fear and anger. There's an ambiguity to Hereditary which is eerily present; how much of what we are seeing is actually happening and to what extent is it just in Annie's deranged mind? The film is just as much a psychological horror, a tragic yet thrilling exploration into the darkest depths of the human consciousness. Whilst Collette is brilliant enough to carry the film alone, she is aided by a perfectly picked supporting cast. Gabriel Byrne provides a much-needed paternal gentleness as Annie's husband Steve, Alex Wolff boils with teenage angst and vulnerability as troubled son Peter, and newcomer Milly Shapiro is hypnotically creepy as even more troubled daughter Charlie. Unlike most horror ventures, the performances in Hereditary really stand out, superbly acted and never overplayed.
Artistic touches also help to elevate Hereditary, from a wonderfully grating score by Colin Stetson to Pawel Pogorzelski's incredible cinematography (wide, square shots echo Annie's miniature dollhouses, almost making us believe the film is nothing but a hellish game). Perhaps the film occasionally gets slightly wrapped up in exposition, but it still manages to be consistently compelling, helped by a stylish and sinister execution.
Hereditary brings a freshness to its genre; even with a classic setup, Ari Aster has crafted a stunningly made film, that simply reeks of pure horror.",Hereditary
770,japonaliya,Have they all lost their heads????,1,10 June 2018,"SPOILERS!""!""
Film started off OK because you aren't sure where this is heading, but goes downhill big time. Think Rosemary's Baby, but not nearly in that same class. Enough with the witch covens and sacrifices already... it's been DONE to death. The only true horror scare is the scene driving to the hospital but even that is derivative of the Final Destination movies. I won't waste your time writing about the plot. I am reviewing this as s WARNING!!! SEE! THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK OF BEING VERY DISAPPOINTED. If you need to see some real scare horror films, See the org. HAUNTING, THE SHINING, IT (TV MINI SERIES) except for the ending, The THING (1980's ver.) ALIEN etc. and scores of others. 
This film will be forgotten 10 mins. after leaving the theater.

773,cmills-98693,A slow burner that fizzles out.,5,16 June 2019,"I went into Hereditary hearing all the hype saying it was the next 'The Exorcist', unfortunately, it just wasn't.The pacing at the beginning is insanely slow, almost snails pace, and you're expecting a 'Wicker Man' style of film where the ending is the big payoff and you're held with a sense of dread winding around you, but the ending is somewhat of a misfire.
The whole 'hell worshiping cult' idea is pretty played out by now, so if you're going to do it it HAS to be a totally fresh take, and this just isn't.
I called about 15 minutes after the 'lucky' arrival of the other wounded grieving stranger that she had an ulterior motive and low and behold, they're worshipping the kings of hell.
While the cinematography and sound mixing is excellent, and the cast are superb (Toni Collette is standout) the story itself feels like it's lacking. There are unnerving moments, and moments that are harrowing, but at no point watching Hereditary did I feel the same terror that The Exorcist, The Wicker Man (1973) or The Blair Witch Project delivered.Hereditary attempts to shake up the horror genres use of cults and rituals but unfortunately falls short, relying on strong individual moments and performances to keep it on screens.",Hereditary
774,hughrcarson,A Modern Horror Classic,8,12 September 2018,"Hereditary is deemed to be this generation's The Exorcist, and considering just how universally acclaimed William Friedkin's seminal 1973 horror classic still is, that's quite a billing.But can Ari Aster's occultic fable live up to this considerable hype?With the death of her mother, Annie (Toni Collette), observes some rather bizarre goings on within her family. What should have been a time of simple mourning proves to be anything but. Far from being laid to rest, Annie's mother's death is the catalyst for much upheaval within the family unit. Something, somehow is messing with the minds of Annie's nearest and dearest. But what, why, and to what ends?Annie's peculiar introverted daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro) - she upon whose 'look' a million Chucky-esque dolls could be confidently manufactured and sold - had been the apple of her late Grandmother's eye; taken under her wing in fact. And it is Charlie who seems most affected by her passing. This most unnerving of children is afforded a relatively short amount of screen time, yet her impact upon Aster's film is both powerful and enduring.To delve deep into the narrative of Aster's horror is to give far too much away, for this is a film not pieced together by way of a sequence of complicated plot twists and devices, but rather a film built upon one effective premise. A simple unnerving tale. A mysterious metaphorical encroaching fog of doom and helplessness which will, given time, engulf everyone in its path, to some degree or other.The casting is excellent. Alex Wolff continues his impressive run of form, once again playing a quirky character with his portrayal of Charlie's stoner brother, Peter. Gabriel Byrne portrays the family's traditional patriarch and backbone, Steve, with predictable assurance, whilst Toni Collette's performance as Annie brings back memories of both Sissy Spacek in Carrie, and more pertinently Shelley Duvall's increasingly hysterical turn as Wendy, in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 classic, The Shining.Littered with genuinely disturbing imagery and highly memorable set pieces, Hereditary conjures up the sort of bleak atmosphere fostered so effectively in Robert Eggers' solid 2015 offering, The Witch. Indeed, the theme of unseen occultic malevolence forms, to some extent at least, the central core of both of these films.Resisting the temptation for cheap shocks and the needlessly overly-dramatic, Aster's film instead benefits greatly from taking an altogether more low-key approach - the consummate slow-burner - in which the sense of fear and enmity increases exponentially in both pace and intensity, leading to a truly bizarre conclusion which will act as the perfect barometer with which to measure exactly what a film's audience will have made of the preceding two hours or so. The sense of serenity that befalls Aster's film in its final chapter is somewhat unanticipated, and as truly peculiar as it is haunting.One thing is overwhelmingly apparent though. This is a film that makes a damn good job of genuinely disturbing its audience throughout. And it's a safe bet that it will continue to do so for quite some time beyond that.Hereditary is a film that will make you think, think again, and then rethink as it lingers like a bad dream in your mind. Furthermore, it will burrow itself effortlessly beneath your skin, heightening your senses, and feeding your primal fears in the process.A sort of slow drip-feed of unease dispensed emphatically, deep into your very core.A modern horror classic.",Hereditary

797,joesiegel,Ari Aster is definitely one of the most promising names of his generation.,9,13 March 2020,"Maybe you just are not understanding it, it may sound pretentious but Ari Aster's Hereditary is a story that is told metaphorically beyond the literally, I had to read about this film to receive details that I could not capture before, the film would not leave indifferent to nobody, breaks with the conventions of the genre and shows something totally different from the current horror movies, this film must be seen with an open mind to interpretations of all kinds to various scenes and history as such.A great achievement of the movie is to avoid all kinds of cliches from current horror movies as religious symbols like back crossings or five-point stars, bible verses or priests, Hereditary creates his own totally different symbol world.First-time director Ari Aster plays with the camera and refuses to make a film with conventional shots, preferring to have subjective and risky shots that show the situation of the characters and surreal and dreamlike scenes that explore the mentality of the characters that goes in decline with the passage of the film.Like 'The Exorcist' this film has great skeptical potential, fear and doubt to believe what is happening, in 'The Exorcist' the priest covers himself diagnosing possible mental illness from the girl's attacks, in this film We are told that throughout family history there has been an endless number of mental illnesses that have terrified the family, this makes us doubt everything we are seeing. Can everything be the product of Annie's damaged mind? and his children begin to suffer the consequences, the end of the film is ambiguous and does not answer this question.As in 'The Exorcist' Peter's character jumps out the window as the priest did at the end, Peter dies and Paimon enters In his body, the latest revelations of the cult that was staying in the tree house suggests that Peter is no longer there, Paimon has possessed him, all these pieces fit perfectly at the end of the film, as because Joannie and Annie's mom knew each other from before and what was their relationship, or the reason for the grandmother's irrational affection towards Charlie and because she always preferred a boy, the grandmother only wanted a male body so that Paimon could inhabit it.Hereditary easily scrolls through so many genres, from a family drama to a terrifying tale of human insanity, Ari Aster is definitely one of the most promising names of his generation.",Hereditary

Its nowhere near as good as the Babadook although it tries. Comparing this to the Exorcist is crazy !

I think this is a large part of the hate, because it can be a difficult story to wrap your head around:Anne (the mother) states that one of her brothers starved himself to death, the other hung himself. She also says to her son (while sleepwalking) that she didn't want a son and tried to miscarry but couldn't.The grandmother, had tried to put Paimon (one of the kings of hell) into her sons. But they would have rather died and did so.Anne states that she would not let her mother near her son, as they were not speaking at the time. But out of guilt as her mother was getting older and senile, she let her nurse her daughter.The grandmother took advantage of having access to her granddaughter and out of desperation put Paimon (the king of hell) into her gran daughter.The grandmother caused the death of her granddaughter to then use her in the afterlife to get to her grandson. The fact that she is decapitated proves this theory, as her mother and father are also decapitated in the end. It is symbolic.Her grandson is supposed to be the rightful air to Paimon. In the grandmothers books it states ""Paimon must be in the body of a man to be strong""Grandmother could only get to her grandson, after death. Using her satanic cult to do her bidding from beyond the grave.Hope this helped. Watch it again and enjoy!",Hereditary

Some disturbing scenes were cut off by Censor board, I'm pissed about that, just GROW UP CBFC. It's a must watch for horror fans.
The story revolves around Toni's dysfunctional family, after her mother's death strange things begin to happen. 30 mins into the film there's a huge blow delivered to the audience, you'll not see this coming. While dealing with a tragic loss, their family encounters a supernatural entity, nothing like the Conjuring movies ,rather similar to Rosemary's Baby.

What the hell were they thinking with that nonsense twist at the end?? It even made me laugh! It felt like ""Rosemary's Baby"" was plagiarised for absolutely no reason. It's a shame considering how good most of the film is.""Hereditary"" is extremely effective as a tension-builder. It's depressing, intense and mysterious. Very few films can create authentic atmospheric horror while developing their characters so well. Toni Colette is simply amazing and even surpassed her previous roles, such as her acclaimed performance in the ""Sixth Sense"". She deserves, at the very least, an Academy Award nomination for Best Leading Actress. Other standouts are the score, production design, cinematography, sound mixing and screenplay (again, with the exclusion of that ridiculous ending). I can imagine this film having nominations in any of the abovementioned categories.Nevertheless, it can be said that this film is (possibly) the biggest disappointment of the year. ""Hereditary"" should be used as an example on what to do (and particularly not to do) with a screenplay. Most importantly, it is fundamental not to betray the audience especially when it has been carried out such a long way! A film with such potential, regardless of any technical qualities it may have, must always seek coherence in narrative and originality from beginning to end. There really was no need to use so many (cheap) supernatural elements to give the movie a decent ending. This film, even surreal at times, was already more than terrifying before it reached climax. Even when the story is complex and dark-toned, prioritising simplicity throughout the whole plot will always be far more efficient than any ""shocker"" ending.Score: 6.5/10FJ Medina",Hereditary

821,bernygilbo,Can't believe I hadn't seen it sooner,9,27 May 2020,A friend of mine recommended this film for me since I'm a can of weird random horror films. This has probably been the best horror film I've seen in the last five years. Kept you interested the entire time and wasn't ridiculous with the storyline as many horror films tend to do. Definitely couldn't suspect what would happen next. Left it open for a sequel and I hope they take advantage of it.,Hereditary
822,jdtech,The only thing scary about this movie is the amount of money I wasted on it,1,12 November 2019,"My grandpa and I went to see this. We believed the positive reviews so thought we should see what the fuss was about. Where do I begin, the beginning of the movie is extremely boring and provides nothing interesting to keep you interested let alone awake. It's not just bad but it's not even believable. If you killed your sister you'd just go up to your room and sleep. REALLY. Toni Colletes performance is extremely overacted. One moment shes all lovey dovey then she's an insane psychopath. This movie has no plot and the moments where it builds up you may think something scary is about to happen but nothing ends up happening. My grandpa and I were embarrassed when we walked out of the theater. It's too bad we can't get that waste of a 2 hours back. For those of you saying this is as scary as the exorcist then you haven't seen good horror. The only thing scary about this movie is wasting your money on it",Hereditary

824,RealMovieReviews,Had potential but massively under delivered,1,7 February 2019,This movie is about 2 hours too long. Cheap jump scares combined with a plot that has more holes than swiss cheese. There is one crazy scene that involved the brother and sister that was crazy (don't want to spoil anything) but other than that this movie just drug on for hours. The ending was weak and predictable.Overall: Skip,Hereditary

For the first 1,5h nothing really happens, and then you get a bunch of dead bodies, bunch of naked old farts smiling at you, somehow that is more scarier than anything in this movie. The guy who is about to get invaded by either the cultists or a king of hell is at one point screaming, ""This is just a dream, wake up."" Well, at the end of it, i was screaming the same thing! Bottom line, you are now a king of hell in your new body and your followers are all just as old as you are and completely naked. You can see the disappointment on his face, and trust me, that is not fear or despair. You got time to waste, feel free to watch this crap.

I don't mind a suspense thriller here and there, and I do like a few horror films. When it's packed on constantly as hard as this film does it just bogs me down. I'm also really not too comfortable with all the satanic stuff that films like this have, but that's just me.That being said, this film actually did a really good job at what it was doing. I found myself following along and staying with it regardless. It was well written and the acting was good for the most part. Some of the scenes with the child actors weren't so great, but mostly it was good. I don't really have much bad to say about other than the story itself and the ending are really not stuff I like. But it was done so good that I have to give it a higher rating at least.",Hereditary

830,VallejoDiego,TRAGIC story and a GREAT Slowburn Horror movie!,10,10 October 2019,"I recently saw Ari Asters 2nd movie, Midsommar, and I really liked it. Hereditary, his debut feature film, is also REALLY GOOD. This movie came out last year and realized the main Actress from this movie didn't get nominated for an Oscar! HOW?! Her performance was amazing. Really the whole caat was GREAT. This is a Slowburn movie but it's a good one. There's this horrible accident in the first act of the movie and the story just keeps you invested. Most of the scares are in the 3rd act. And they are creepy to look at. My only really flaws with the movie is that they try to involve the son with some girl and they touch on it for like 3 minutes and never again. Thought that was kind of weird , unless I missed something where that was very important to the story. And also the last couple of minutes of the movie. Ari Aster basically explained via dialogue the ending of the movie. I get why he did it because it would've been very confusing for audiences but it would've kept them thinking and have them rewatch or research more about the movie. Overall, Hereditary was GREAT. Ari Aster is off the a terrific start with his first 2 films and can't wait to see what he does next!",Hereditary

His expressionof his sadness, was very authentic so he could never be the antichrist. But the cast was brilliant !!!So i call it a missed opportunity.Because I am a horrorfilm fan.

835,thewakenarrative,Good Time to Check Out AncestryDNA,6,13 January 2019,"Hereditary:
Disappointment and enjoyment; those are two words that come to mind when thinking about watching the largely hyped new horror movie ""Hereditary"". We were expecting it to be scarier, more shocking moments, more questions about the movie concept. Not questions about scenes and motivations. Don't get us wrong, we thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie, however, we left disappointed with a gut-wrenching feeling of emptiness. It's like going in for a bite of pepperoni pizza, only to discover it's a kale salad. Just like Kale salad, this movie did not fill our stomachs with horror goodness. All hail king Paimon! This was a new villain which was refreshing, but ultimately another devil-worshipping plot line. Grandma was crafty and sealed her families fate years ago. If only her son hadn't learned of her plans (or gone insane) and ended his own life, then Annie's family would not have needed to cease to exist. Ok, well Peter made it out, lucky dog. Paimon prefers a male host. They're keeping it all in the family as the title suggests, it's hereditary! We were at the edge of our seats waiting for that ""jump"" or ""ah ha"" moment. I guess when Hell freezes over we will be satisfied. We kept waiting for the figurines that Annie creates to come into play after the first scene had shown the figures coming to life. Were we supposed to think they were all pieces in a puzzle that was set into motion years ago? So much more could have been explored! But, Toni Collette and the rest of the cast were outstanding and it was very well made. Also quick shoutout to the talented Milly Shapiro (Charlie) for making her character truly convincing and strange! And, those doll creations you constructed, #creepy.
Superlatives:Worst Death: Would it be the beheading of Charlie, the suicide of Annie herself, or look your husband is on fire? I think it's a three-way tie!Most likely to have a booming Etsy business: Grandma Ellen and her lovely personalized floor mats. Where can we find those?!Best Liar: Aunt Lydia. I mean, Joan. Nothing like conning a mourning mother.Overall Grade: B- (you passed, however not quite there for a solid grade)",Hereditary

837,CoffinVideo1983,Could not have been more impressed!!!,7,12 April 2019,"I have been a fan of horror my entire life. Every style within the genre at that. However, this style of occult, demonic film has got to be my favorite... hands down! Not only was the film shot beautifully with an amazing cast and brilliant storyline, but I have give the upmost credit to screenwriter Ari Aster, along with any researchers on the project, for their 100% accuracy on the lore within the story. A lot of demonic horror films just reach for random names, places, and ideology to be the basis of their stories; however, I can assure you, that is not the case with Hereditary! In an age of information and fact checking being literally at our fingertips, this film did a wonderful job with demonic accuracy. I can't applaud it enough for that fact alone. Also, speaking of Ari Aster... Hereditary was his feature directorial debut. If we continue to see brilliant films like this from him, he is going to be in direct competition with Jordan Peele for the next horror master! I rate this 7 out of 10. (...and that's a conservative rating on my part.)",Hereditary
838,ssnake_z,Uneasy,7,19 August 2019,"HEREDITARY
RATING: 3.7/5They really need a sub category for these kind of so called ""horror"" movies because this is the same thing that happened to ""mother!"" Apparently, HEREDITARY was marketed as the ""scariest movie ever,"" which it is not, by far. There is horror imagery and an uneasy feeling throughout a lot of the film, but there's never anything really scary, and I'm not just talking about the lack of a single jump scare. Guess you could just call this kind of movie ""Horror Lite,"" where they're not really hitting you with jump scares but you're probably not gonna leave the theater feeling happy go lucky either... i guess if ghosts make you uncomfortable, you might find it scary, but that's on you, cause the film definitely ain't trying to make you jump out of your seat.The film is pretty long too, for the amount of story you're getting, it's over 2 hours. They could have tightened up some things and maybe picked up the pace a little. Apparently, the director left 30 scenes on the cutting room floor and the original cut was 3 hours long. 1 hour cut from the film, and a lot of it still felt like setup, setup, setup, so it could then lose its mind in the 3rd Act the same way ""mother!"" did towards the end. The overall message of the film feels lost. If I had to guess, you could argue that the message is, you can't escape your family's history, even after they die, unless you're willing to completely let them go. Or something along those lines perhaps, but it doesn't feel earned, and that's the problem.On the positive side, the acting is pretty solid. The family does a pretty good job of portraying their grief and dysfunction. They do it so well in fact, that for a little while i forgot that i was technically watching a horror lite film. It's like they stepped into some depressing indie film for a bit, until they were forced to come back to the horror genre. That probably wouldn't have happened if the film was paced better. The music also does a good job of accentuating the uneasiness throughout.The more i think about the film the more it just doesn't hold up to scrutiny as a horror film, and i think that's what's hurting it the most. Hereditary falls under the horror genre but it doesn't feel like it's trying to scare you for the majority of the film, it just wants to make you feel uncomfortable, like really uncomfortable. If they were gonna cut an hour off the original cut, then it needed another two or three passes to work out all the kinks. I'm honestly curious how different the 3 hour cut is, but as it stands now, Hereditary is not a very scary movie despite the horror elements in it. Be warned though, despite it not being very scary, some of the imagery may stick with you because it is a well crafted movie. If you do decide to go see it, just know what you're getting into so you're not blindsided and disappointed by the lack of jump scares.",Hereditary

841,Mklangelo,"Great flick (for horror, that is)",7,25 August 2018,"I'm going to confess to thinking that the Horror Genre, in general is 95% crap. It is a repository of junk. I can count the offerings of this type of film that are truly good films on two hands and I'm being generous. The Excorsist, The Omen and The Ring are a few that come to mind. And honestly when a Horror Film gets a 7 or above in IMDB, it's almost meaningless. I think the folks that are true Horror fans have a pretty low set of expectations. I think lots of kids are fans of the genre which might explain the high ratings.Hereditary was really a nice surprise. The movie's plot starts slowly. The tension and creepiness build very gradually to a crescendo finale that really puts a chill up and down your spine. Skillfully directed and Toni Collette was really superb. And that little girl is one creepy looking kid. Mom won't have to spend a dime on baby-sitting her because nobody is gonna mess with that kid.If you hate horror movies because most of them flat out suck, treat yourself to this little gem... And leave the lights on.",Hereditary
842,poohead45,Whyyyyyyyyyy?,3,7 February 2019,"So, I was really excited to see this and I was finally able to the other night. I had no idea what this was about other than Toni Collette was in it and it was a horror movie that I kept hearing positive things about.I'm a person that has to watch scary movies with a hand over my eyes and peep through my fingers. I expected to be having nightmares and having it haunt me...
Well, I guess they did make me feel haunted but in a pretty negative way.
But I am still thinking about it and talking about it... Regardless if you're getting positive or negative talk, any talk is good.Anyway, I just do not get where the positive reviews came from. What I witnessed was a real mess that was full of plot holes and had no character development.I will admit, I watched it in two days on my firestick. The first day the volume just seemed really low and I did think I missed some things but day two I put subtitles on so I could know what was being said better.Spoilers***1. What was wrong with Charlie? (if it was said I missed that part)2. Wtf was up with the mom forcing Charlie to go with the brother to that party? It just made no sense! Charlie didn't want to go. The brother didn't want her to go. After seeing how the mom acts I can see why the son didn't fight about it, but still... Why let a young kid that clearly has issues go to a teenage party with people she doesn't know and she's too young to even try to fit in.3. I don't have any food allergies that would kill me, just some that make me have migraines and stomach issues and even with my not-that-dangerous allergy I always ask if those ingredients are in anything I eat. Charlie didn't question if there were nuts in the cake? She just ate it? She had no epipen? I guess the retort could be ""well she was possessed by Polimon (or whatever his name was) so she had no choice""
But we really didn't know all that until the end. The situation comes off ridiculously absurd, especially with the close up of the nuts being chopped in a frenzied shot. This wasn't foreshadowing this was beat-you-over-the-head Charlie's going to have an allergic reaction.4. Speaking of frenzied camera shots. It was pretty clear to me that Charlie was going to be killed with the way the drive was going. I couldn't even take that seriously. Normally with that kind of thing happening I'd be yelling out loud ""oh my God"" or ""wtf?!"" or some exclamation of shock and horror. With this scene it was expected and my reaction was to hysterically laugh about the absurdity I just witnessed.5. I'm assuming this was glossed over to not make this film any longer than what it was but we saw absolutely no immediate events after Charlie died,aside a two second funeral. I wanted to see the son and the parents interaction upon finding out the son left the dead sister in the car.6. Why was Gabriel Byrne in this? He had hardly any presence or lines. He was bland and he could have been played by anyone. He's a great actor and I didn't get why a big name actor would want that role. Also, how did he deal With the wife. I yelled repeatedly, ""leave her!"" at the screen.7. Toni Collette... Wow. The faces. I can't. Her acting was so over-the-top. When she was looking through that photo album those expressions were out of control. I couldn't stop laughing. I work at a mental health facility and I felt like I was at work watching this. So I guess her acting was good but she was also reminiscent of Peggy Gravel in Desperate Living (from John Waters).8. Did they have a dog? It was literally in one scene and died (?) maybe (?)9. I truly felt bad for the son. Poor kid went through a lot.I get the allegory of it all but it was just too lacking and full of plot holes to me to take it seriously. It might have worked better if they were trying to go for absurd and darkly humorous.I probably have more to say but I think I'm just done thinking about Toni Collette's faces in this.. By the way, I am dying laughing just thinking about her faces.Toni Collette's character was the biggest monster in this movie in my opinion.Her dioramas were amazing by the way. I would love to see more of them. That was my most favorite part. They were so cool and detailed.",Hereditary

874,nicolinafina,It had so much potential but faild on the way,6,23 August 2018,"This is going to be one weired review.
Looked forward to this movie so much. I popped my popcorn, waited until dark and all I felf for the first 80 minutes was boredom. It was so slow. It was a good story, but too slow. You don't put on a horrormovie and wait 80 minutes to get some kind of scary wibe. The only good thing with the slowmotion is that you have time to catch all the little dots that connects it all, but I bet some people missed them because they were thinking about what they would do afterwards because they were bored.
The script/story was amazing! All the dots connected and it was easy to catch them all up if you could pay attention the whole time. The acting was really good. Already knew that Toni Collette knew her stuff, but I didn't knew that Alex Wolff could do a role like this so I'm impressed.
The effects was really good, the scenery was really good, it was very very nice directed and so on - but still I felt bored. 
The movie had every potential for a 10/10. Everything with the movie was perfect, but the movie it self were too slow. I would love to recomend the movie to others, but I already know that most of them probably will turn it off within the first hour.",Hereditary
875,birdsonthings,Do not see this alone!!,8,21 June 2018,"This film is TERRIFYING. I was on the edge of my seat the entire duration of Hereditary. Some people may dislike the film because I don't think they truly grasp the depth grief can take on someone, especially a family. I saw this movie 6 hours ago and some of the scenes still haunt me. You really empathize with the characters. I really liked how the characters stories were laid out so you start to grow attached to them. Then the tornado of horror starts and I found myself wanting to hug Annie like what a nightmare she goes through. Once the car scene happened, I went on a roller coaster of emotions from sadness to despair to shock to sheer terror to anxiety to empathy to complete despair. It really will mess with your psyche and emotions. The music was one of my favorite parts of the movie. I mean you just cannot look away. Some scenes I found myself jaw dropped thinking ""I CAN'T believe they went there!"" Hereditary is on my top 10 horror movies of all time. Be prepared to be shocked and terrorized out of your mind. This movie will grip you tightly and not let go til it's over.",Hereditary

This film is an absolute mess. Cliche after Cliche.
Once it started finally decided to start moving with a terrible story it just got so ridiculous that everyone was laughing. When it was obviously trying to be scary. 
I so wanted to like this but sadly left holding my head with disappointment ,almost anger as it might have been decent ,if it was made in a different multi dimension.

877,serina25801,Ever left a film feeling angry?,2,18 April 2021,"My friend and I went to see this on theaters. We're both big horror movies junkies and if you ever go through my reviews, you'll see they're my thing. I was so excited to go see this film based off of the trailer. It was the first time in years where a horror film truly looked like it would be disturbing and eerie and it had my full interest.Then I watched it.The first third was AMAZING. Best part of the film. It was disturbing, it made you feel intrigued, yet uncomfortable - it was looking like this film would be the best horror film of a generation.Then the second act started. It wasn't bad. Had you going about a family falling apart and a mother unable to cope, trying to find ways to. A son who was guilt-ridden and understandably losing it. A dad trying to hold a family together as best he could.Then the final act happened and destroyed everything the film had going. It turned an amazing film into a standard possession/haunting flick. I was PISSED. The ending was so generic, so aggravating, that we left the theater angry.I've rewatched the movie since, thinking a couple years after seeing it, maybe my view would change. But no. Like the first time, the ending just makes me mad.This film could have been the greatest psychological thriller/horror of its time. How a mother drowning in grief can't cope and her psyche breaks down. A son who can't come to terms with what happened. A father watching his family fall apart. If the movie had ended showing that it was a manifestation of the mother's depression and psychosis, it would have been PHENOMENAL.Instead, we're left with a generic ending that even then 90s would call clichéd.",Hereditary
878,sarahilayda1,Disappointing Yet Interesting,6,9 September 2018,"OK, I had to admit that I had good expectations about this movie like I had for The VVitch and Mother!. I'm very disappointed for those as well. I think they share similar problems. That goes without saying, if you liked The VVitch you will like this movie.I'm going to list the things I liked first. 
-Acting was great except Toni's in my opinion. She was too over the top almost hysteric at times but understandable acting/directing choice, it's my personal opinion. The little girl was just great.-Editing and cinematography. I think this movie could get an Oscar or Golden Globe nomination for editing or cinematography. I especially enjoyed editing since some shot transitions were flawless.-Doesn't have any jumpscares and doesn't rely on traditional scare tactics, and still is interesting. -Story is kind of interesting but I think negatives out weight positives.Let's come to things I did not enjoy.-This movie is extremely slow like The VVitch, most shots are pointless and do not serve the story. If they could've stick to 90 mins I think the story would be much more enjoyable since at many moments I was like ""When will something, anything happen"". And when something does happen you need to wait another half an hour for the next thing, its painfully slow for that story. I think they were trying to fill time frames for the lack of story with good cinematography which is a shame. -Story is NOTHING new. I knew what it was going to be about from the beginning and when it got a little bit interesting it got dull again. The plot of this movie can be summarised by 3 sentences and even that is too little for a horror movie. It gives you basically no explanation about who the people are, why are they doing what they're doing and what is their end-game. The story is suffering from same thing with The VVitch. There is a basic idea and an execution but no quality.-They're trying too hard to be good. In my opinion, a good horror movie is more than jumpscares and other stuff, it's it's story and acting. Like I really enjoyed Before I Wake which isn't your traditional horror and Annanelle:Creation which is. But this movie is just like ""OK let's be artsy and try to do something mysterious"" but it fails. It's not artsy nor mysterious. Ending is a complete fail as well.Overall my recommendation is watch it with little to no expectations. I do think it's worth a watch but if you'll have any expectations you will be disappointed. UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY LIKED THE VVITCH. Then go watch right now.",Hereditary

It was by far, not scary. If anything, I actually got a bit bored.
The way the movie progressed, it felt as if the director filmed a gritty family drama and then at the last minute, decided to change it to a horror movie, in an attempt to parrallel the classics, like The Exorcist.
The last act of the film is so out of context with the rest of the plot, it felt extremely rushed and completely pointless.
Now, don't get me wrong, the drama and acting was quite good. IF the film had remained as a dark and tense drama/thriller, I would probably have enjoyed it, as I would have not gone to the cinema expecting to see a horror movie.
It was not the scariest film of the year. It was OK until the last 10 minutes or so. Not going to waste my time with it again.",Hereditary
891,johnnyutah31,Methodic Fright,8,18 September 2018,"It's been a while since I've been so excited to see a film. This movie has been highly anticipated since its trailer debut and the closer it got to its release date, the more worried I was it wouldn't meet the expectations. I can gladly say after seeing it today, expectations were met with a little extra maybe to boot. First off, in all my years of movie going, this was the first time I actually saw people walking out the theater. Not because they weren't enjoying it, but because they clearly felt it was a bit too overwhelming, especially towards the end. I could hear one woman behind say as she walked out ""i can't anymore, this is too much."" The films finale is something to behold. It's a definite slow burn of a film, at times a little dull, but it all leads to something quite unsettling and explosive in its own intense way. The acting is all around special with Toni Collette giving a powerhouse performance. There's no jump scares here, no creepy ghost kids or phantom ladies with black smokey eye sockets. It's a dramatic film with levels of uneasiness being elevated as the film progresses. It also doesn't require too much analysis either, it's pretty straight forward but not simply drawn out for you also, if that makes sense.

He comes off as indifferent, cold, and rather impatient with his wife throughout the entire movie. He is actually bordering on unlikeable.The only thing that I can equate this film with is when Axl Rose delivers a stunning vocal performance only to ""f"" it up in the end by holding notes too long and sounding utterly ridiculous.I am seriously upset, AND stunned.What WERE they thinking?",Hereditary

After an interesting but far from scary first hour, the movie descends into a ridiculous, over the top, laughable mess that was embarrassing to watch. Yes the acting is good, at least until **SPOILER ALERT** the ""seances"" and it all goes downhill from there. The ending was so awful and stupid that I could not believe that was it. Really??? The stupid demon thing with the crown and everything, with the music volume turned to 11 as if it would make it scary??? It was laughable. And many in the cinema were laughing.

The movie industry has brainwashed people into believing that horror movies are about jump scares, and I've been saying that it's the cheapest way to fool people. Jump scares are scary by definition, they just startle people. There's a difference startling someone and really making them scared.

907,dwolf77,Unsettling,7,10 June 2018,"This film is very well done. The cinemotography was done exquisitely, as every shot is well composed and very pleasing to look at. The acting, especially from Alex Wolff, Toni Collette, and Milly Shapiro are all fantastic. For a directorial debut, the film knocks it out of the park. I would consider the majority of this film to play out like a psychological thriller, as most of it is suspense being built up. Near the end of the third act is when things truly get scary. There are a lot of memorable and unsettling scenes throughout the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed every part of it right up until the ending. I won't spoil it for you, as I feel you should go into this film knowing as little as possible, but it felt like the entire movie was original and different right up until the end when it turned into something I felt like I had seen before.

908,hlahorner,Could have been much better,8,17 September 2018,"I am pretty easy to scare, and while I'm not a fan of slasher movies, I do enjoy the more moody, atmospheric, psychological thriller type of horror. Hereditary seemed to fit the bill, and it did start of very promising. First, the funeral, and then a disturbing turn of events. Then things slowed way down. The director relied heavily on music to set the mood. So much so that for a good portion of the scenes, if the music had been different it could have been a drama about a family trying to come to terms in the aftermath of tragedy. I turned to my husband at one point and said that woman needs to get herself into therapy.As the movie was slowly building up to the climax, most of the things that happened were unsettling and disturbing, but not outright scary. Then in the last 10 or 15 minutes all hell breaks loose. Things escalate and the twist is revealed and all of this information comes fast and out of nowhere. Other reviewers felt the story was not scary, but I disagree. I thought about it a lot over the next few days, and It could have been much more so if the build up was more intense. We should have discovered more clues about the grandmothers secrets in the middle of the movie. I believe another reviewer described the story as undercooked.The cinematography, special effects and acting were all good. It is worth a rental.",Hereditary

910,ajacayen-47694,Hereditary - An Elevated Horror Drama about Family,9,1 July 2021,"Hereditary is one of those films that have finally watched this evening with the whole family. Every time I hear that title, I have always been interested and curious as to how this film became one of the most critically acclaimed films yet failure to impress the general movie lovers like Mother!, The Witch and The Babadook. After watching it, I have finally understood where I stand with this film in the divisive reception: I love this film just like those mentioned ones that could not get the audiences' love.Ari Aster's direction and writing for Hereditary is simple yet elevated in a way the audience could easily relate to and be entertained with. Unlike other generic horror films, Hereditary managed to combine the realism and supernatural that takes a turn to a dark and foreshadowing events that are meant to be suggested everytime a dark scene occurs especially in the first act of the film. With the addition of great cinematography and horrific ambience of the film, Ari Aster's future films are worth watching.People may either hate or love this film, but I am sure there is one thing we can all agree on: Toni Collette is the best part of the movie. Her performance is so real I was worried that she might put herself over the top and become insane. It is unbelievable as to how she can become calm in some scenes as if she is trying to maintain her sanity and suddenly becomes a frantic and insane mother towards the family.Alex Wolff is surprisingly great in this film ever since I saw him in Patriots Day and the modern Jumanji films and I think this is his best performance yet. As the weed addicted and extremely weak son of the family, his acting felt as a typical teenager whose emotions are so fragile and finds it difficult to communicate with his personal doings and problems. I am excited to see what roles Wolff will take on in the future.At the start of the film, Milly Shapiro is so intriguing yet creepy to look at because of her strange personality from the get-go. There is something off-putting about her and being introverted and unusual is not the only word you can describe her. I hope I see this child star more in other horror films because she fits perfectly in the role.The film's main core is family grief: how a family overcomes a tragedy but only this time, in a dark matter. That's what makes Hereditary unique and other films exploring human issues great because it makes you think of ""what if"" questions therefore the film does its purpose to question its realism. Just like The Shining, being alone in a hotel for more than weeks or months and becoming delusional would actually be real.Hereditary is a great example of combining art and entertainment. Not only that people will be fascinated by how the film executes its artistic concept extremely well, but it also manages to make the general movie lovers be entertained by the thematic elements that I am sure people have seen and can relate to but elevated in a different level.Craziness and disturbing are some of the few words that I can describe Hereditary. There are many unnerving scenes that I could make out from, especially from the first act of the film which foreshadows what type of movie I will watch. In the second half and further on, it becomes even more creepy and psychologically effective in its characters and horrific elements to it.There are also some signs in the film that I feel it drew inspiration from other great horror movies such as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. But that doesn't necessarily mean the film does not stand by its own because it does. What makes it different from those two mentioned films is the story and the combinations that filmmakers have not yet explored.Overall, Hereditary is one great horror film that I have seen for a long time and I think it will take a time for fans of the genre to appreciate this kind of movie just like The Shining. If you have seen the film and did not like it at first viewing, try watching it again and maybe you can understand why people including me felt disturbed and unnerved by its horrific execution of the story.",Hereditary

However just because someone wants it, that doesn't mean it actually happens in the same way. I am VERY pleased to tell you that Hereditary for the most part REALLY delivers as a class horrormovie.Unlike most ""horrormovies"" that have come out recently, this one actually has a good story with interesting characters, a good narative and another purpose besides making a lot of money. During the whole movie there's this very unsettling atmosphere, with some very good scares and a truly disturbing finale. The acting is also very good, especially the protagonist really shines in this movie. Now I do have to say that the pacing isn't always as good as it should be. The whole movie in general has a pretty medium to slow pace. It really takes its time to set up the characters and story (which is good!), however it takes too long before the plot really kicks in. The horrorgenre is (of course) paranormal activity, because that's the only genre they can make apparently, but it takes a really long time before the paranormal activity is introduced. Given there are some tense scenes and unexpected twists here and there, but the movie isn't really about those things, it's about the characters and how they deal with the situation. As a filmlover this was really nice to see, but people who only go to see these movies for the scares and don't really care about a good story will be dissapointed I think. About those scares...FINALLY a horrormovie that doesn't rely on jumpscares, FINALLY!Guys, this is definitely a horrormovie to check out. It has been given an immense amount of popularity, but it's for a reason. It has a good story, well written characters, some very good scares that actually work and the acting is splendid! The pacing is a bit slow and the plot really takes its time to get introduced, but that is all forgiven for a very tense and scary finale that kind of reminded me of the finale from The Vvitch (2015). It's not THE scariest film out there, but it's definitely one of the best of recent years.
I give it a solid 7.7/10",Hereditary

Do not lose 2 hours of your life watching it! It starts slow.... gets a little promising and then very very slowly turns very very baaaaad and laughable!

This is a very unsettling movie, extremely creepy and tense. I also think it is very realistic. I won't go into how I know that.

922,tetraslash,"Starts off strong, and then heads a different direction",6,28 August 2018,"Horror movies tend to have difficulty nabbing ratings of 7+ on IMDb, so I was intrigued after seeing this movie getting a 7.5.To start things off, the movie is two hours long. But I don't think it should've been. You spend a minute or two watching someone go from Point A to Point B when you could skip that and it wouldn't make a difference. I'm not cutting points off for that reason though.I think the acting was great and the effects were authentic. It didn't feel forced or fake; it felt natural. Everything seemed coherent. There were no jump scares in the movie.So, if I liked the movie, why did I only give a 6? The reason boils down to the plot changing directions later on in the movie. I wanted to give the movie a 7 for the ambiance and suspense, but it just felt like the plot wasn't strong enough for me to give it a 7. The movie is more of a 6.5, if I can give it that.How should I explain? Instead a 'specific' character being the expected cause of everything, the director decides to push on with an alternative ending that attempts to add in more explicit horror for no real reason. It was like the director knew exactly what he wanted, and then halfway through thought it wasn't scary enough and did something else.Overall, this movie is okay to watch, but I recommend fast forwarding through slow scenes so you don't waste time and can just get straight to the point.",Hereditary

Literally as the plot unfolds you think the movie is exploring one aspect of humanity but then it changes course and does something else entirely until you are left with a tangled web of crap at the end which shows that it was all satanic in the end.

But this movie is really perfectly paced. Some may complain it's slow in the first half but if the first half didn't set the eerie tone and give the characters depth you would not feel the emotion for them as strongly. The mothers performance is Oscar worthy. I mean she's incredibly talented in this movie. Charlie is the perfect creepy kid. I hope this movie blows up and gets shared for everyone to see as me finding it was a freak accident. I had never even heard of it or seen previews. Don't even watch previews.

While it's not too hard to get a cringe or a jump out of me in such a film, it's rare that I actually feel uncomfortable. This film was different.This movie is super bold, and puts you right in the front seat of it's most disturbing elements! During the first super graphic scene, we had to pause the movie because it actually made us feel ill. This film is sometimes terrifying simply in the way the characters react. With that, all the acting this film is great, but I think Toni Collette's performance is stellar. Everything from her interactions with the family, to her facial expressions, to her chilling cries and screams, Annie was responsible for at least half of the waves of terror that hit me throughout the film.At first, I didn't know what to think of this film. I was so disturbed by it that I almost regretted watching it, but yet, I was impressed and couldn't stop thinking about it. Sort of like a really good haunted house.Since I'm now comparing this film to how terrifying others are, I can't deny that it's one of the best Horror film I've seen in a long time. I considered rating it higher, but the reason I give it an 8:
I think the film is too long. Not just the general runtime, but I feel like it could have had about 5-10 minutes less of long shots, especially with sustained emphasis on the disturbing imagery. I understand the film is supposed to be shocking and detailed, but sometimes it was just a little much for me personally.Sorry, but I didn't like the ending. I get it, it was just a let down to me.I think I would only ever watch this film again to see a reaction from someone else who hasn't yet. ;)Any fan of Horror films that hasn't seen Hereditary yet definitely should.

933,rmwilliams-18922,"Unoriginal idea, yet unique delivery",10,26 June 2018,"This movie presents nothing new in terms of plot. Supernatural entity taking over a family. Nothing new here. However, the way this movie was executed was unlike anything I've ever seen before. I felt uneasy from the start. Even though the ""horror"" did not pick up until a ways into the movie, I felt the tension from the start. This movie provided a feeling of uncomfort throughout the whole thing, even during the non scary parts. I think the family tension plays a huge role in that. Not just terror with the supernatural, but tension within the family. 
This movie made me do something I never do: my jaw dropped and stayed dropped for like 2 minutes straight at one point.
There is also a part of this movie that I think filled me with the most suspense and anxiety I have ever felt watching a movie. 
It's quite refreshing to see a movie rely on actual terror and creepiness to provide the ""horror"" instead of meaningless jump-scares, and that's what sets this movie apart from the rest of the movies like it.I would give it more than 8 stars, but there were points in which I was either wishing it moved at a slightly faster pace or holding back laughter at a couple of the ""scary parts.""

This movie may not be for you.I want to give absolutely nothing away. There's not much more to say than bravo to everyone involved, and what an outstanding job by the cast. I have never felt such powerful empathy for characters onscreen in any genre of film, so much that this becomes genuinely difficult to watch at times for your shared pain with these characters.The tension is ratcheted up without mercy, slowly, relentlessly. Many subtle deft touches, little things that may escape the eye first viewing but resonate at a deeper level, as the nightmare coalesces, made all the realer for the bond you've formed with these brilliantly portrayed characters.Bravo. Restores your faith in the genre, relies on none of the cheap tawdry tricks of so many lesser horror films of late. Simply outstanding, and genuinely frightening like few other films you'll see.

Unlike most horror films this one never used jump scares or cheap effects, this had imagery and sound like never before! The acting is absolutely flawless, especially Toni Collette. Toni has never performed so perfectly! She deserves a lot of recognition for her terrifying role as a grieving mother. Hereditary is a really sophisticated film that feels so real you forget you're watching a movie. The film is centers around the Graham family after a loss of their grandmother and dealing with family relationships that obviously are very off and uncomfortable. Annie basically is broken, but she breaks so unbelievably horrifying you'll never forget it. Her son peter is suffering just as bad after the horrid accident involving the death of his sister Charlie. Things couldn't get worse right? Well they get so much worse the Graham family starts experiencing terrifying occurrences throughout the grieving of both losses and trying to keep them together. Steve, Annie's husband is just not believing any of this involving his wife's friend Joan from the grief counseling sessions she secretly went to earlier on. After all this Steve thinks Annie cracked but really all these premonitions are real and actually happeneing because of the grandmothers connection to a cult falling to the hands of King Paimon. If you enjoy films like the witch, or rosemarys baby you'll LOVE this! It's my favorite film of all time, and of all horror!

I think it did a really good job showing the unspoken problems that many families may face. Miscommunications; I think are one of the main causes.One of the key element of the film are the casts. Everyone acted so well. They all have great chemistry together. Toni Collete, however, was exceptional in her role as the mother.

It's not a ""fun"" horror film in the traditional sense and you get the feeling Aster is getting off on making you as disturbed and uncomfortable as humanly possible. As a lifelong horror fan, it's nice to see a new horror movie where you feel incredibly unsafe the entire time.Hereditary functions mostly as incredibly dark domestic drama with Toni Collette carrying the film as Annie, a struggling artist whose life descends into neverending tragedy after her estranged mother's death.

With a metascore of 87 we felt we could be in for a treat. However, the movie failed to grip us in any way. It was a long slow journey towards a disappointing end. Tension starts to build at certain points, but lets up too quick and we loose a bit interest in the characters as the movie progresses.The actors do a good job, but sometimes direction have them overact and that looses some of the impact.

The movie steels a few frights from other movies such as the exorcist, and if you haven't seen it and all the other movies this one borrows from, you might very well enjoy them. Lastly the movie does certain things without explanation. It's almost as if the filmmaker said to himself, ""it'll look freaky if the son does this weird thing, or mom does this weird thing.

949,jennifer626,Overrated but worth a watch,6,21 June 2019,"Before watching Hereditary, I read a number of reviews that called it not only the best horror movie in 2018, but a competitor to The Exorcist. This set my expectations far too high, and it took me a while to get past being miffed and acknowledge the film's good qualities. Prepare yourself for an occasionally engaging but uneven film with a few novel twists, and hopefully you won't experience the same level of disappointment.The film is premised on the audience not truly understanding the nature of the characters. However, neither the characters as presented nor their interactions with each other ring true. Mother Annie (Toni Collette) is an artist who builds miniature worlds, often replicating personal environments such as her mother's sickbed. We're expected to believe that her work is in demand and that she is behind in creating new pieces for a gallery showing, but her art exists only as a conceit, a literal demonstration to the audience of her mental state. Her mismatched husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is the world's worst psychiatrist, alternately enabling and ignoring the disturbing behavior of his wife and children. Their teenage son Peter is a stoner with a crush on the girl who sits in front of him. He is the most authentic of the family members, but the decisions forced upon him by the script - most of them related to Peter's sister Charlie - highlight that he exists only on film.Charlie is the most contrived of the lot, and it's not because of the reasons provided by the movie. Her matted, unwashed bob and cheap, oversized clothing are too shabby for a homeless girl, let alone one from an upper middle class home. It's impossible to believe that she is 13, let alone a girl who would attend (and whose mother would insist she attend) a high school party with drugs and booze. None of the revelations about Charlie fit with the developmentally delayed misfit portrayed.It's difficult to divulge more about the film's shortcomings without including spoilers. The positives are that the pace is relatively quick; there are some enjoyable jump scares; and regardless of its logic, the ending is unpredictable. Paying close attention to the narrative and settings from the outset will make the final discoveries more rewarding.",Hereditary

952,briz_boy_10,Too slow for its own good.,3,20 June 2018,"Recent reviews i had read insisted that this film was described as a whole range of things from an original classic to a terrifying horror and even a game changer that's as scary as The Exorcist. I've even seen people tell me that they are horror 'veterans' and found this film to be one of the scariest they have ever seen. Clearly in this case, they are not horror veterans; and i imagine they probably found something like Gremlins to be utterly horrific.As you can probably tell after seeing these reviews I had hopes going into this movie. I wont say high hopes because I've been let down too many times by those kind of reviews before.To start with the positives, the acting in this film is as good as it gets from veteran actors Toni Collette (who is outstanding) and Gabriel Byrne to the younger actors in the film who played their children. The acting is so good that i felt the trauma and the tension within in that they themselves were feeling which is a really heavy concept throughout the entirety of the film. So A* for that. Also, something I liked for the first half of the film is that there lies this eerie silence that builds up tensions but at the same time this is part of its downfall which leads me on to the negative aspects. The constant feeling of something feeling like it maybe going to happen looms around for way too long and in the end the error in this pacing leads you to become tireless and honestly, quite bored. In the cinema me and my friend turned to eachother wondering when some thing was about to happen, not just in the jump scares department but in its storytelling. The film goes on for way too long before you even have any idea what the plot actually is. All we really know is that there has been a trauma and it isn't until its too late, where you've almost began falling asleep (which may be a tad harsh) that a thing or two, literally, happen. A case could be made to slot this film into the drama category as opposed to the horror/thriller genre.All in all i don't want to spoil this film too much for anyone. The film has terrific acting but its lack of plot and scares leaves you with little to take away from this experience. I believe that the film thinks its better and more original than it actually is, and in the end doesn't come close to the all time classics like The Exorcist. 5/10",Hereditary

""this horror flick can be so shocking and dismaying, so genuinely upsetting in spasms and spurts, yet at the same time so madly entertaining""Do not be fooled fellow imdbians, with more than two full hours, this film has you yawning for more than 60 full minutes before something happens.

958,bryanberrios96,Completely clever use of horror,10,12 June 2018,It's been a while since I don't feel so anxious in a film. Unlike other horror jumpy movies during this one you'll jump but also the story itself is gonna hunt you till the end. Is one of the darkest movie I've seen in a while and the cinematography qualities and details helped create a very specific mood to the scenes. I love the big contrast with dark and and bright colors on the fire or red etc. It was very successful that they focused a lot on frontal shots to completely feel and digest the actors reactions. Is very very bizarre and disturbing. The scene where the brother kills his sister is everything. I can't believe how convincing and horrible it was. LOVED IT,Hereditary

Myself included.I'm afraid it's another movie where the trailer is probably the best part; tied together with pointless dialogue and scenes which served little to no purpose, and could have saved the audience 30/40 mins of their life if they'd have been left out.I can't understand how this movie has achieved a rating of 7.7.

963,markusibbetson,What was hereditary?,3,18 July 2020,"This is one of many horror films I've seen that can't decide which sub-genre it wants to be.
For the most part this film is about the strange occurances that happen around grieving mother, Annie. Things happen in such a way that the viewer wonders whether the paranormal happenings are real or whether they're in Annie's head as she loses her grip on reality.
A small part of this film is that Annie is the daughter of a woman who was part of a mysterious cult, wanting to find a host for their demon King Paimon.
Hereditary should have either stuck totally with the haunting of the house after the death of Annie's mother and daughter or it should have been about Annie find out her mother was part of a cult. The two story parts don't work together.
The biggest problem this film has is that the devilworshipping cult (which is apparently what the strange goings on are all about) has far too small a part in the overall story. The explanation that the cult have used the body of Annie's son, Peter, as a host for their demon master is crammed into the last couple of lines of the film, which makes for extremely bad story telling and leaves you with a ton of questions.
There are some moments of questionable behaviour e.g. your son seems to have a stroke, then smashes his face repeatedly into his school desk, so you patch up his nose, take him home and just put him to bed.
There are also some unintentionally funny moments e.g. when a floating Annie cuts her own head off (possibly with cheese wire) or when said freshly decapitated body floats up into the treehouse or the random appearance of naked people, like their waiting for a swingers party.
Toni Collette gives a great performance as the grieving Annie who seems to be losing her grip on reality, but she cannot save this confused and rather poorly written film. Hereditary is far from 'One of the best modern horror movies', as I've seen others refer to it.
I will say this - the final scene does have some lovely music.
And finally - what exactly about any of this was hereditary?",Hereditary
964,ohthatguyproductions,I don't even think the writers knew the plot.,2,16 June 2018,"Just watched this in the theater (6/15). I can barely tell what the story was. It weirdly changes throughout. I can't even identify a part of the plot that I can associate with the title. It can be compared to Rosemary's Baby in such a rudimentary way, that the comparison is made only to make you see it. Decent performance by Tony Collette and one surprising moment but too many story elements were as laughable as they were uninterpretable. This movie took forever to say nothing. With so little payoff, you'll feel gypped for having spent the movie wondering what the heck is going on and why would anyone chose to tell it that way.",Hereditary
965,bwasman-30723,Oof,3,2 October 2018,"It's just not THAT good. It's incredibly slow and boring and not in the good way. It has its tense moments and the occasional disturbing scene, but it's mostly just sad. It also doesn't make any sense whatsoever by the end. It's not scary and it's really not even a horror movie. I'm being generous with a 6 because I appreciate the few tense and creepy moments and the disturbing parts and because I love the score (Colin Stetson does a brilliant job, as always). It could have been so much better if it were a half hour shorter and a whole lot scarier (and a final act that made sense). It's just kind of a confusing slog, and it's disappointing because I wanted to be disturbed.",Hereditary
966,scottbeaudette,A ride you aren't likely to forget... unless... well...,9,6 July 2018,"Hereditary is no doubt an instant cult classic. The performances were 100% on point with the material. The mood of this film is unrelenting, uncomfortable, unforgiving and unapologetic, which most refreshing considering how much audience pandering is typical in movies. Thematically, it is very similar to The Witch with the same dark and despairing undertones, but also with occasional humorous visualizations reminiscent of The Visit or Get Out (sans hipster connotations). Whether the humor was intentional or not was unclear, but not disruptive. Hereditary is a disturbing visual and emotional cruise that asks the audience to simply sit back and um... enjoy the ride. If you can do that, then you will appreciate Hereditary's dramatic capability. If you're seeking another banal ghost horror movie, look elsewhere.",Hereditary
967,Cinemagoer77,Best horror film in years,9,26 July 2019,"The movie opens with a funeral and the death of the main character's mother. You notice during the eulogy, no one is particularly overcome with grief..toni c's character was possibly raised by a narcissistic parent and we know the damage they can cause. Toni Colette had overcome and continued to do so as a loving parent. The sympathy and hope for t.c.s character was established well in my opinion.
The writer did this for a reason and it worked so we could suffer the horrific shock as to what lies ahead for the family. There is an emotional tragic tone as soon as the 1st ""tragedy"" took place and it never goes away. It is horrific and gut wrenching. The horrific scene is seared into my brain. Toni Colette is that tearful mother. I don't really cry at horror films but I almost did watching that certain scene. I like Conan the barbarian movies and am no easy tear dropper. From then on you realize even though the grand mother is dead the effects from her life carry onward. The feeling of absolute desperation for the family to beat evil never went away for me. Some horror movies don't get the same reaction from me. But....all of this hope only to find out this is one absolutely bleak horror film that built tension, desperation, throughout, masterfully. I was wanting and hoping they would over come. Don't wrongs get righted? They do in many other horror films. The kids are basically innocent and even they were not immune to this evil bleakness grandma carried onto them. The ending ties it all up with the questions being answered and why this evil befell them and yes it is rather horrifying and disturbing. Not unique but done better than anything I have seen with similar stories. Some didn't care for it but i liked the slow build up and the ending answered what it needed to. I think it is a a better horror film compared to rose mary's baby. I only say this because that is what some have compared it to. This is a time when some horror movies can be made better than the older films with similar ideas. I believe this horror film was the best to come out in a long time. A film that horrified me like it is supposed to. I thought horror films were dead and lamented that the genre produces nothing horrific anymore so this film was direly needed. It is not perfect and i don't understand some of the scenes yet..i give it a 9 because it isn't perfect.",Hereditary

No cramming information down your throat, no jumpscares, no unnecessary violence, no cliches, it's a pure psychological roadtrip to hell and back.When Annie's mother dies, she doesn't know that during her lifetime she made a deal with the devil in exchange for wealth and riches, and her family are the ones who suffer for it. After feeling like she lost everything, she is targeted by the cult, who claim to be her allies in going through the pain but their inner motives are more sinister, and something she can't prevent no matter how much she tries.

I was half expecting Toni Collette to slap her and scream ""Stop frigging TOUCHING ME!!!"" Alex Wolff is fine as Peter, but his ending (spoiler) as he is possessed by what ever spirit is so dull and blandly presented, he looks like he could be looking at the menu at cracker barrel instead of a demon finally brought back to life. Toni Collette is good (spoiler) apart from a ridiculous, and laughable, ceiling spider crawl not to mention her pointless wtf death. Gabriel Byrne is absent only providing some familial tension hilariously popping up as the stick concerned husband/ father. All in all a waste of time.

The ending really ties everything together. The only thing holding it back from a 9 or 10 rating is that it's a 2 hour movie, that should've probably been 30 minutes shorter. A lot of down time, but the last 20 minutes are insane. If you find yourself almost giving up on it... don't. It's worth getting through.After it ended, I pieced together about 95 percent of the story... if you don't figure it out for yourself, or really even if you think you do, it's worth reading an explanation article AFTERWARDS.It's quite an intelligent story, and world the writer has created. It's a thinking movie, but also with almost a ""slasher"" feel.The movie was critically acclaimed and loved by critics... but received mixed reviews by the general public. I know the directed has just released Midsommer with a similar feel to it, but I really hope at some point he puts out a sequel to this one.

Of course there are exceptions, and if someone wants to turn a very long book into a movie I can give it a try, but someone filming and original script and a making a 147 minutes long movie... that's simply telling me about a director's huge ego, and that's no good. And i think this movie is the perfect example to confirm my theory... the plot is great, the acting is fantastic (Toni Collette creates a wonderful character), but it is soooooooo slow. I swear I tried, but I was feeling so bored watching it... and then, suddenly, after 90 minutes of slow movie, the plot takes a twist... and there's still one more hour to get to the end. Such a fantastic story could have been told in 90 or 100 minutes. The long, silent scenes, make no impact as drama, they just happen to be boring.The history of cinema teaches us that limitations are good. No good, wonderful!. Time limitations made wonders to create an effective cinematographic language; budget limitations did the same to create wonderful ways to tell something without actually showing it, even censorship was great to force screenwriters to tell what they wanted to in a clver way... but a writer and director's ego of today doesn't understand that. It's HIS work and he feels it has to be perfect like that...So sad, because it could have been an excellent movie.

Horror is the most subjective genre and different people get scared by different things. I personally don't find find modern horror movies like the conjuring, insidious etc scary. So I am happy that I finally found a movie that actually scared and deeply disturbed me in a really long time.The best aspect of this movie was how complex and well written the main characters were, compared to the poorly written, bland, boring one-dimensional stupid teenagers that we are so used to seeing in modern horror movies. Another great aspect of this movie were the feelings of sadness and dread that is present throughout the movie. This movie has some really scary sequences which involves slowing building tension and dread without relying on cheap jump scares. The themes of grief, depression, mental illness and loss were incorporated very well into the story in a metaphorical manner. Toni Colette's performance was the best I've seen all year and it's a crime that she wasn't nominated for an oscar.However I felt that, a small aspect during the climax could've been presented in a better manner. The naked cult members during the end turned out to be unintentionally funny instead of creepy and came close to ruining the atmosphere of the scene.Overall I think this is one of the best horror movies of this century right next to the witch, tumbbad, babadook etc.",Hereditary

Horror is not all supernatural but this film was more of a thriller with the thrown in supernatural elements of possession and demonic characterization. But definitely a thriller. A roller coaster of emotions surrounded by mental breakdown and loss. I think if it was left at mental derangement being it's final plot point and not the actualization of a demonic takeover ie. Shudder Island I would have liked it a lot more. The ""everything isn't always what it appears to be"" plot. This film just gave us too much but not enough. There was nothing to follow or anticipate because we didn't know what was happening no clues given until the end. And then we're like wait wtf is happening here? Now it's a supernatural demon possession plot with the demon trying to takeover before it has the ability too and folks being set on fire through some witchcraft or worshipping of the demon? No it's the demon that's doing all of this right? And because the demon was first in Charlie, it still inhabits Charlie's characteristics or is it Charlie that's in Peter with Paimon? It seems the director or writer needed a reference that would be significant so they used that clicking of the tongue. I guess and again too much but a lot of nothing.

It crosses numerous red lines and leaves you at the end with nothing but a ""Duck this piece of Crap!"" attitude.",Hereditary
1006,Hereticked,Hot Garbage,2,1 July 2018,"The worst doo-doo trash I've seen in a theater in quite a while. I looked at my watch several times and almost walked out 30 minutes before it was over. I can't believe this has good reviews!Hereditary has a silly, disjointed plot and the scares are a jumble of every ghost story and haunted house cliche you've ever seen in a generic horror movie. The cast are a mismatched group who only know how to overact or underact. There was, maybe, one genuinely creepy scene in the entire film. The rest of the time I was rolling my eyes or snickering.",Hereditary
1007,Coburgkiwi,Genuinely creepy but ultimately disappointing,4,8 June 2018,"I'll be honest - I saw the trailer and was blown away. I jumped on a tram as soon as I could to head in to the city to watch what I thought would be a film setting a new benchmark in horror. Well some of the reviews described it in the same league as The Exorcist. And the majority of the movie reminded me of 'the turn of the screw' ie as the tension tightened and tightened. But while most of the movie was genuinely creepy, I was so disappointed w the last half hour. It turned from creepy to verging on ridiculous. As another reviewer has written, I suspect that the writers ran out of ideas and didn't know how to wrap it all up. While I applaud the creators of this movie for having some very creepy moments .......and not resorting to the cliched scarey 'moves' that ended up ruining the 'Paranormal Activity' series ie knives falling from the air (yawn), cupboards opening with a bang all at the same time (yawn) or other horror movies that have a doll or dolls in a rocking chair (yawn) or a toy rolls into an emptyroom only to be pushed back out by some unseen force (yawn) - yes good on them for not resorting to a number of tired cliches. But the last half hour and ending were SO disappointing. I guess I will take the tram back home and wait for another movie to redefine the horror genre.",Hereditary
1008,doddio,"Not bad, for a horror movie",6,18 December 2018,"This is actually a pretty decent family drama, with a few good scares, but it suffers from the ""shrill wife, wooden husband"" trope, which drags things down in the second half.Seriously, producers, if your plot depends on a shrill wife, rethink it. No one wants to watch that; it's lazy, sexist, annoying and almost impossible to act well, because it's so contrived. How about a ""strong wife"" instead?",Hereditary

I like a longer film if it is good. This one promises, but just doesn't deliver. The ending is predictable, and weak.",Hereditary
1012,Leray97,Extremely overrated,2,29 June 2018,"I do think that seeing so many rave reviews for Hereditary raised my personal expectations because I walked out of the theater feeling perplexed as to how people could compare this film to the likes of The Shining or Suspiria and how so many people were genuinely disturbed by it. Hereditary definitely borrows a few elements from the aforementioned films but I myself wouldn't place it anywhere near the two classics. The sound design is really the only redeeming factor I can think of in this film. While the soundtrack and sound bits aren't anything we've never heard of before, hearing the foreboding tunes and heavy ambient music did help in forcing the me into the right mood. The way they were used as accents to outline a ""scary"" scene was obviously a big focus for the filmmakers.The cinematography was also good, especially for having so many indoor scenes. At a glance, the visuals make Hereditary seem like an art-house horror type of film, which it either isn't entirely or doesn't even know if it wants to be. The movie, as a whole, looks like it should be really good but in the context of style vs substance, there isn't enough substance to complement the style, in my opinion. There are already so many films with exceptional cinematography and this one is no standout in any way.I wasn't a big fan the acting either; at best, I'd say it was serviceable for a horror. The scare factor in a lot of horror flicks can be predicated on the actors, by whether or not they can sell their performance in a crazy scene. In this regard, I think Toni Collette is the best part of the entire cast of Hereditary. On the flipside, I just couldn't take Alex Wolff seriously. There are times where his character has to portray some extreme emotions but I just couldn't connect with him. The way he would cry or whimper at times would really take me out of the moment and completely cut all the tension away from what was causing him to feel that way.I've said ""horror"" many times throughout this review because my vocabulary and syntax could use some work and also because Hereditary is labeled as one. I know horror is another one of the subjective genres but I fail to see how anyone could walk away from this film feeling truly disturbed. There are really only a couple moments of disturbing imagery in the film but outside those instances, I never felt anxious or tense. That's not to say that I'm some macho man because I'm not, but there was even a few times during Hereditary where some people in my auditorium actually laughed. I'm not a horror aficionado but I don't think one such film that is stylized like Hereditary should be making the audience laugh. The fact that this movie isn't free of some of the usual horror film cliches doesn't help, either.This is probably too long of a review from someone who isn't well versed in the horror genre but I just didn't enjoy Hereditary like everyone else did, and I'm not special for that. To the people who have watched already it, I personally think the last minute or so of the film should have been cut.",Hereditary
1013,oliviacrossley-26338,This movie was amazing,9,16 December 2019,I really enjoyed this movie. It had a bit of scares here and there and the plot was amazing. I had never seen a horror movie with a plot like this and I thought it was a very good take on that concept.,Hereditary
1014,atishnramdonee,Disappointed,2,4 November 2018,"That's one star for Toni Collette and another one for Alex Wolf; if not for their vivacious and gripping acting, I don't know what else would have kept me on my seat.But seriously though, what the actual duck was hereditary in this movie?Just because the granny gave the chain to Toni doesn't mean sheet. While, it so happens that this family has been dabbling with the occult - probably for generations - the hereditary part has been underplayed. I mean, if the end goal was to invite Paimon, so why the duck wasn't Paimon able to get into any other family member's body before, especially if they have been doing this for generation. And if there have been other people in the sect, why not them?Because this movie ends with every member (dead and alive) of the satanic sect coming together to welcome the demon, who is supposedly inside Wolf's body, which seems to have been the actual goal of worshipping the demon all this time, when there clearly were other males around.Therefore this climax doesn't cohere well with the rest of the story. I mean, the end of this movie was truly a big ducking mess; from being strange, and calmly unsettling, it moved to good ol' fashion possession, crawling on walls, devil worship, and sheet.It felt a revisited Paranormal Activity 4 or 5, minus the found-footage part.Disappointed.",Hereditary
1015,brandythefox,Well crafted - but am divided on the ending,8,26 December 2018,This film is curiously what everybody who's posted reviews here say it is. It is both stunningly good and disappointing. The last 20 minutes are where it breaks down into either a masterpiece or a cheap parlor trick. Really can't tell which one it is but guess you need to watch it again a few times to be sure.Toni Colette is a legend and this film will continue to cement her legacy as one of the best actresses out there. Shapiro and Wolff arr revelations. Byrne is just Byrne (been the same character for the last 20 years) but it's a decent effort.Well worth catching,Hereditary

If there is something in this movie that makes no sence you only need to watch it for a second time. And I do want to watch it again just to watch the reactions on the rest of my friends! Everything that happens is as it should be to make the plot slide forward in a way that doesnt look at all forced.
The acting is superb from everyone, the horror scenes very well placed and in many cases original and the only thing that actually looked out of place is the casting of a 21 year old actor as a teenager student.

You know, like when you think to yourself, ""Maybe I shouldn't be watching this at night alone."" (That is my yardstick and I think it is as reliable as they come.) 
Like so many others said, the characters do things that seem so implausible that not only make it hard to relate to them, at some points I found myself disliking them.

Loved it.",Hereditary
1023,jakethesandbag,Truly truly the next great horror film,10,14 May 2019,"I almost want to preface this with ""Don't watch the trailer."" I went into 'Hereditary' completely blind - I had only heard of the buzz it was getting (stereotypical critic buzzword write-ups like ""The New Exorcist,"" or ""Scarier than The Exorcist"" or ""This generations' Exorcist"" - like, WE GET IT, ""The Exorcist"" was great), and I had also seen the poster, which is vague as hell. The only other insight I had into this movie was from a phone call with a friend of mine, another horror-film fanatic, who said that the trailer depicted a chaotic, insane, terrifying film. That's all the preparation I had for this movie, and ultimately, that's all I needed. Because in the end, I had no clue what I was going into. It's a bold statement to say that this is the best horror film in decades, because not only have there been very great horror films over the last few years - but it's easily there for me (maybe the Conjuring...). It's scary, yes, but there are little to no jump scares - instead, there is some of the most disturbing imagery I have ever seen. There is drama, there is humor, there is campy-B-Movie tropes. Yet, this potluck of a film is perfectly executed. It's remarkably directed, written, performed, shot, and composed. Every arc has a perfect little bow-tie; every reveal or twist is not gimmicky, but rather fulfilling and grandly alters the film before it. I fear that going on about it, or setting any expectations here on out, would be removing you of the setting I had for this - little to nothing. Go in to it blind if you can, and let it wrap you over. One last little thing to even try to explain my love for this movie - I haven't felt this enraptured by a horror film since probably the first time seeing ""The Shining."" LOOK AT ALL OF THESE BOLD STATEMENTS I AM MAKING, and yet, I honestly feel that this way.",Hereditary
1024,groovieknave,"Not the worst, but not the best...",6,23 August 2018,"This movie is very creepy, it's a slow burn though so be prepared. The acting is absolutely amazing! Toni Collette is something else, she's just impressive and that's worth watching alone even if you don't like horror. The performances are insanely good by most everyone with screen time.The biggest problem with horror is the irrational behavior that occurs during the films. I just don't see how it's possible for certain actions in this film to have taken place and that's why it will never be scary enough. If only they could just leave out the out of this world behavior. For example, there's a scene where a child is having an allergic reaction and she sticks her head out of a moving vehicle. I'm sorry, I just can't get into a movie with something that stupid! Just let them have an accident... why does it have to be so moronic?This movie could have been so much more scary without the nonsense. If you see it you will know what I mean. I would have been much more scared out of my mind if the incidents that lead the plot would have been much more realistic. A satanic cult with a subtle supernatural hint, and crazy nightmares would have freaked me the hell out! The atmosphere and acting were stellar, and it was well put together. It's only fault is being silly with what happens, just stick with some reality, just some, when it comes to horror! Whenever you writers and directors feel like making irrational behavior, put it all into the crazy characters... not the victims! Sigh.",Hereditary
1025,timaenot,Poorly acted and directed ego trip without sense and substance,1,28 July 2018,"In fact, most bad movies still deserve a couple of stars - for sound, cinematography or for one good actor. The reason why I am giving Hereditary only one star (and would give zero if I could) is that it is not just a simple bad movie; it is a pretentious bad movie, taking itself deadly serious and pretending to be ART - without being it. This claim is what makes me so furious. Be bad, be unprofessional, be unintentionally comical - but do not pretend you are something that you are not!!Hereditary is bad, because it can never decide whether it wants to be drama or horror - and does not succeed in both. The horror is not gruesome, and the drama does not work because you feel no compassion for the characters and have no interest in them. How could you, if they are shown as unsympathetic - not to say, repelling - from the very beginning on?? This repulsive quality seems really hereditary! The neglected mother looks like a long-time alcoholic, the daughter has disturbing looks and behavior (a very well-acted part, but evoking no sympathy at all), and the son is so miscast and badly acted it is just impossible to care about him. The only figure that deserves some sympathy is the poor father of this deranged family (why for God's sake did he marry this woman?..). The plot is messed up and confusing. More than that, the film gets unintentionally funny where it tries its hardest to be dramatic, and the poor acting makes it even funnier. I never saw Toni Collette before but the job she is doing here is dismal. Her performance is one-key, without any nuances. Where is this whole gamut of emotions other reviewers are speaking of?? Look at her eyes (there is ample chance to do so, due to the many close-ups). The eyes of any good cinema actor are his or her key instrument to convey emotion. Her eyes are empty, without any expression. Her only way to portray emotion is getting hysterical - and not even then is she compelling. I do not know whether she is a bad actress; the fault is anyway the director's. I am usually very prepared to sharing the emotions on screen, especially regarding loss and sorrow. But this time, my friend and me had to laugh when she tried to play a nervous breakdown - this says a lot... 
Do I have to mention that this film makes a game out of constantly referring to the great classic horror films, especially Shining and Rosemary's Baby, without ever coming close to their quality? We are art, because we play with art! No. You are not. If you want to see this movie, wait until it is on TV or Netflix or something. Do not go to the cinema. Do not waste your money. And, much more important: do not support this wanna-be ego trip with your money.",Hereditary

1028,abryan,Not for everybody.,9,21 January 2019,"The most helpful thing I can say about this film is that it's not for everyone. If you're a fan of movies like Saw, Hostel, The Nun etc. Chances are you'll hate this film. But if you're a fan of movies like The Blair Witch Project, Annihilation, The Witch and The Babadook, chances are you'll like this one.Personally, I've got to say this movie has stayed with me. I'm not sure if it frightened me, repulsed me, depressed me or fascinated me? Or a combination of all of these. For me all the lead actors were spot on with their performances. And yeah, granted, after the movie I had to go Googling to find out what it was all about, and about some of the iconography that featured in the film.If true be told, the story itself isn't that original, or even that clever. But for me is the general mood of the film that makes this something special. As with The Babadook, there is a distinct sinister, creepy, unpleasant melancholic feel to the whole film, and there is no comedic relief to ease the mood. Right from the start you are on a downward spiral into the abyss. And again, if I'm being truthful, chances are you'll be left feeling quite depressed after this film.... But in a good way. If that makes any sense.For me the final chapter of the movie is its star. Without giving too much away, the whole last section of the movie feels like surreal nightmare. Both fascinating and repellent at the same time.As I say, not for everybody. There is little in the way of jump scares, gore or even action. There are a few ""OMG"" moments. But this is a long movie and one you need to put a bit of investment into. Worth a watch.",Hereditary
1029,aziza-ismail1,"Unsettling, gripping, terrifying but ridiculous end",7,7 September 2018,"This is by far one of the most terrifying films recently made. Its a slow burner and as the move progresses it gets more and more terrifying. The director creates tension and suspense at different levels and it escalates into a ridiculous end. Everything was executed flawlessy to create an unsettling atmosphere and unlike usual horror movie this one doesn't rely on any jumpscares to scare or shock the viewer. Full points for that as it takes a brilliant director to create that. The background sound was weird but it help bring the tension in.The main lead, Annie plays her part exceptionally well and you can see she is a great actress to pull of a role that is demanding. Her expressions itself speaks volumes creating that uneasy, uncomfortable portayal. The girl had a very creepy character and you can spot the sinister and mystery in her. You can feel the family's tension throughout the movie which potrays a very disturbing and disfuncional one.I would have rated the movie higher if it wasnt for the nonsensical ending which I felt disjointed grom such a tense, gripping, unnerving and terrifying film.",Hereditary
1030,visionaforethought,Dissapointed,3,16 June 2018,"After the two sleeper surprises of A Quiet Place and Game Night (Both my fav movies of the last few years), I went into Hereditary hoping for the same smart compelling ride. I had not seen any trailers so had no inkling as to the plot or any minor spoilers.
I did make some assumptions once the movie started that did not pan out, but as other reviewers have said this film got hokey and silly as we approached the end.
It was as if the director had come up with some ideas for scenes, and just made up the plot as he went along, similar to Lost, that was never really explained, more an addictive TV series designed to distract Americans from the war in Iraq. ('Bread & Circuses')
Anyway, yes, a few horror like surprises to shock you, but that is all.Just as a general comment, this film accurately portrayed the very distant relationship American parents have with their kids, something also made clear in Breaking Bad re the relationship between Cranston and his son. The way they reacted to Peter's misfortunes was cold and inhuman from a European social aspect, but spot on to how I see Americans behave within their family unit. Anyway, that is for discussion outside this forum!",Hereditary

This film has moments that unnerve you, shock you and may even disturb you. These unsettling moments contribute to the uneasy atmosphere present throughout the film, but it is not a horror film. The ""scares"" are fare and few between and is spread so thin, you forget this is even supposed to be a scary movie.Many times I found myself bored and questioning why anything is even happening in this film. It's a plot that reveals itself at the end and you have to wonder - why? What is the purpose of anything happening? You won't find that answer.However, the film has incredible acting, amazing cinematography and well crafted score and screenplay. This film falls short on it's ridiculously laughable story and lack of actually being scary.

Nothing even remotely scary. Lastly, using a spirit like Paimon for the plot is cheap in my opinion.

And then there's the glass game. Right there I knew the only way to go was deep down hill. And this time I was right. As soon as the whole seance and demon crap came in, I lost my interest and respect for this movie. And it's not that I don't like this kind of theme, it's just been way overdone and there's really nothing new you could add to it.

1041,christianrmaxwell,The Scariest Non-Traditional Horror Movie of the Year,10,9 June 2018,"This movie is not a traditional horror movie. In fact, I would even go so far as to say it is not even a horror movie at all, just a heavy drama movie with terrifying elements to it. This movie did absolutely everything right, from the extremely realistic dialogue, to the astoundingly realistic visuals, to the cinematography, and more. Everything about this movie just worked, there was absolutely no scene or shot that felt unneeded or unnecessary. The movie looked gorgeous, and then, fitting for the mood of the movie, it seemed to darken the colors and the tone of the shots and cinematography overall. The acting in this movie was complete perfection, down to even the most minor of characters. Toni Collette gives by far the best performance I have seen by an actress this year and I can easily say that she deserves to be acknowledged in the upcoming Oscars. Even Alex Wolff, whom I did not think would do a great job within the movie, did an outstanding job. The thing that drives this movie forward is the pure tension that is felt not only within the characters and between them, but with the audience as well. This movie is horror at its finest, pure tension, no reliance on jumpscares. There was a particular scene that just blew me away with how well it was shot, it involved a character being in their bed and then looking around their room thinking to have heard something, and all the while, there is a mysterious figure lurking in the darkness. And rather than use this figure to provide a chance for a cheap jumpscare, the director just lets the audience soak in the image of that entity in the room with the character, and no jumpscare happens. This is the definition of a pure horror movie that relies on tension and nothing else. This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen all year, and the second best horror movie I have ever seen, right behind 2015's The Witch. This movie blew me away, and if you are a fan of horror movies, drama movies, or both, go see this movie. It is utterly and completely amazing.",Hereditary

1062,crosshatch,Toni Collette made the film,7,29 August 2018,"The film itself was decent. Not a great horror flick by any means. Collette's acting far surpassed the quality of the writing or the story. Alex Wolff, um, was just plain bad. First of all he was WAY too old to cast for this part. All he did was stare emotionless into the camera and the his entire character lacked any depth whatsoever. Hearing the word ""Mommie"" was just...not believable from a 20-yr old playing a 16 yr old.
A few too many loose ends, weak plot points and just not enough chills to make this a great horror. It wasn't even suspenseful. Dragged a bit. 
It gets 7 stars because of Toni Collette and I didn't feel like I totally wasted my time. A decent lazy-night B-movie",Hereditary
1063,bradaviel,Nice effort !,6,15 June 2018,"For a first movie, it's a really nice one. The cast is amazing, some scenes are really heartbreaking (in the first third of the picture) and there are many good ideas (the first shot is just... wow !).
I didn't know what to expect because i meticulously avoided every article, review or trailer, just knew it was sort of a Rosemary's Baby/The Exorcist/The Witch kinda flick (which are quite différent, but let's say it's not a Saw or a Freddy Krueger). And it was supposed to be the movie that finally gave you some real terror on screen.
Unfortunately, the movie, even though it doesn't use all the easy tropes that we are common to these days (like cheap jump scares and such) takes too long to get into the fantasy-horror element. Or let's say, you can consider the movie just being a family drama up to some point (with again one heartbreaking moment you never want to live as a human being). And that shift point came too late in the movie for me. So late I wasn't part of the audience anymore. I was just someone sitting there, waiting for something to happen, as someone who's watched tens of thousand of movies before. The magic was gone when it finally started to come together.
I find it sad because there are a lot of good things. I mean a LOT, from plot development to an ambiance that reminded me of the best creepy feelings I had watching the first season of True Detective. Also, the director/screenwriter's intentions are really interesting (I won't spoil it, you can find a good article diving into everything on the /Film website). 
Finally and again, some shots are really creepy on paper and and make for memorable big screen moments (again, no spoil, just check the movie out). 
But alas, I wasn't in there any more. I was still interested in how that would end (in contract to what i felt watching ""The killing of a sacred deer"" for exemple), but I felt like someone was just telling me what was happening, instead of being engulfed in it.
I'm really interested with what's coming next in Ari Aster future because there's so much to dig in here (screeplay, narrative, story building and directing wise), and I'm really happy I took some time to go and watch this in theaters. 
Just sad it didn't have more of an impact on me. But I have to confess, The Exorcist never had that grip on me everybody is talking about. So maybe if the Friedkin flick scared you to death, don't forget to check this one out.",Hereditary

Loved the aesthetic of the house, the colors, and the story of Pagan haunting the household.Colin Stetson's soundtrack holds up very well here.Anything I did not like? Because of that head pole scene, and the body freeze scene in the classroom, this makes me want to not watch the film again. Aster uses these body disfigure scenes it seems not just here but Midsommar too, and its usually these scenes that stick out like a sore thumb.I think the film could of been stronger if there were scenes of the grandma doing pagan ritual scenes, shown when she was alive, and instead of the big reveal at the end have a little more pagan sprinkled throughout the last hour (kind of what I said about Midsommar too). Instead of reading a book about Pagan mythology, maybe Toni's character stumbled into a Devil Church and walked into it out of curiosity and all the same people in that church were present at the cabin in the last scene.",Hereditary

1073,bricemavillaz,A great quality watch but a bit overrated,7,13 June 2019,"After hearing much ravings about this one, I gave it a go. Unfortunately and as always, it doesn't live up to its hype (so never believe it). Awesome actors (Byrne and Collett were oustanding as always), though Alex Wollf delivers a very flat and dull performance. It fits his character but it does a disservice to the actor. Hereditary's main stand out point is it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares to work, it knows how to build tension and mood in a mature and smart way, using slow shots and a truly remarkable soundtrack. However, the movie could have been 10 to 20mns shorter, I think it would have helped the rhythm, which feels kinda slow and dragging in some points. I also thought the ending was kind of underwhelming, you see it coming from three miles away (though the movie delivers what's expected, it doesn't ""pretend"" it's going to surprise you with a twist ending). Clues are peppered throughout the movie starting at the very beginning, but in my opinion they're way too obvious and literal...kinda feels like the director thinks you're a very thick person that doesn't get subtle clues. The other thing I disliked about the ending is that it's too explicit...I wish the director would have gone for a less ""in your face"" approach for the finale, and maintained a kind of ""did this really happen?"" vibe. As it is, I feel the ending (the 5 final minutes) is redundant and hammers in what has been established throughout the movie. Great film, solid horror movie, definitely worth a watch, but in my opinion the director lacks maturity and has a tendency to hammer in what should have been better left implied and suggested. It would have been a really great film if the director, talented as he his, wouldn't have treated the audience like 12 year olds that need explicit scenes to understand the underlying message. Really good horror movie, but not nearly as awesome as everyone says it is. This speaks volumes how low the public's standards have fallen, thanks to useless and exploitative garbage like paranormal activity, people now seeing a decent horror movie call it a masterpiece. It's good, but nowhere near the gem it's heralded as. And the director, although lacking in maturity, is definitely someone to watch out for. A good 6.5/10.",Hereditary
1074,quothage,"Slow burn beginning, firey end.",7,25 August 2018,"I had to come and add another review to the thousand or so already here. I guess Heriditary is not for everyone. I watched it and midway through I caught myself pondering why, when I already have so many nightmares, I'd watch a film that was giving me genuine chills. Its not perfect by any means, at two hours I think it could definitely have used a little trimming, while wonderfully put together there are some long slow shots in the first hour that just draw the pacing out unnecessarily. That said, I also considered that perhaps it was to provide a counter point to the drama that really begins to make the movie unfold at about the 35 minute mark. The spark to the touch paper of this film left me with a physical sense of chill. Then I begun to get bored again, and I was considering turning it off. Then thought to myself, its a shame that we've got so used to having quick pay offs that we can't admire the detail. A bit like drawing a dot on a tiny model laptop to signify the camera? There is some lovely direction here, even if it does sometimes feel prolonged. From the hour mark onward, I was treated to a rare (in modern horror) and palpable sense of growing dread. It was nice to see new actors and some less familiar, but still known ones, playing unusual roles and doing so well. Perhaps in this sense giving the characters more of a feeling of genuineness, as you were seeing a character not just ""such and such"" playing.One thing that I would preferred would have been a little more depth behind the inheritance. Some removal of character exposition earlier in the film could easily have made way for a little more explanation to exactly what happened at the end. But perhaps that was the point.",Hereditary

1079,Stars-and-popcorn,'Hereditary' is the best horror movie I've seen in theaters in years!,9,8 June 2018,"'Hereditary' is one of the most unsettling and viscerally horrifying movies I've seen in years and I absolutely loved every single moment of it.2018 has been a less than satisfying year when it comes to the horror genre. While films like 'Insidious: The Last Key' and 'Winchester' failed to live up to expectations, 'Hereditary' blew them away. It features a brilliant cast that manages to dig their nails deeply into the roles that director/writer Ari Aster creates for them. He proves to be an absolutely brilliant creative mind with a keen eye for detail and masterful understanding of dread. At its core, 'Hereditary' is a movie about family and the secrets we keep from them. At the center of it is Toni Collette who plays a mother who recently lost her own. The two were estranged towards the end, so she's struggling to feel much of anything after the passing. During the grieving period though a mystery starts to unravel that proves her own mother was a very different person than she thought and lived a secret life that is threatening to undo her own family in the wake of her death.The cast is absolutely incredible, especially Collette who has a face made for horror films. I mean that has the highest possible compliment and am referring to the expressions of terror, shock and gut-wrenching grief she experiences throughout it. In short, Collette has absolutely epic crazy eyes that are almost as nerve-racking as the actual horror elements of the film. In the film, her character does her best to protect her own family from her own grieving process, not wanting to put any more stress on them. Her stoicism though leads to her mask of sanity slowly slipping as the film goes on. She's not the only member of the family that is suffering the loss of her mother though. Her own daughter, played by newcomer Milly Shapiro, has a hard enough time dealing with people and things deteriorate rapidly after she loses her grandmother. Shapiro is unbelievably creepy from the moment she appears on screen. So much so, that I had to update my own list of the Creepiest Kids from Movies. Her off-putting performance invokes a sense of anxiety that lingers throughout the film and she is a sharp contrast to the rest of her family. While everyone has their issues in 'Hereditary', there is something clearly wrong with the young daughter of the family.Director Ari Aster embraces a number of creepy thematic elements that all continuously add up in little ways. Collette's character works with miniatures that unnervingly accurate recreations of everyday scenes in her life. They are so accurate in fact that there are times in the film where it isn't clear if shots are of miniatures or of actual scenes. Shapiro's character follows in her mother's creative footsteps with her drawings and unsetting dolls that she makes from items she finds laying around. Together the two show that they have a need to escape from reality, but it's questionable whether their hobbies are healthy or not. These are just small examples though, but most of the details in the film are small. Things that would be upsetting just on their own, but combined together create a visceral reaction in the audience. At times it's almost hard to watch 'Hereditary', but it definitely pays off if you can keep your eyes open until the end.In typical horror fashion, 'Hereditary' embraces the fact that white people do the dumbest things when it comes to the supernatural. Collette's character becomes obsessed with unraveling the secrets of her mother, especially after the family experiences more tragedy. While the family is splintering apart from the events of the film, she starts an investigation into the paranormal to find answers and soon finds herself out of her depth. The results of her meddling where she doesn't belong are absolutely terrifying. Aster though doesn't focus on jump scares or a lot of blood splatter to tell this tale of horror. Instead, his approach is all about tone and pacing. 'Hereditary' is a completely engulfing experience that you can not only see and hear but also feel. Don't let that fool you though, there are still plenty of moments in the film that are hard to watch.'Hereditary' is a hardcore horror film. A far departure from what we have gotten in theaters lately. The characters and story connect with the audience early on and because of the emotional bond, it is able to manipulate our feelings all the more easily. It's not a film for the faint of heart or those prone to nightmares, because the unsettling feeling of anxiety it creates will linger with you long after the credits. The person I saw the film with commented that they did not feel safe after watching 'Hereditary', while I personally felt emotionally exhausted. For me, the fact that it was able to invoke such feelings proves that it is a more than successful entry into the genre. Those who want a real horror movie will not be disappointed in 'Hereditary'.",Hereditary

1086,ventery,An Uncomfortable Portrayal of Grief and Sorrow,8,1 November 2018,"Hereditary is another one of those allegory films that has many interpretations which was brilliantly depicted throughout the film. The difference between Hereditary and Mother! for example, was the fact that Aster gave the audience subtle clues that hinted at many interpretations whereas Mother! left you feeling confused for weeks.The choice of acting talent was a perfect fitting for the film. Toni Collette who played the mother was astounding in her role and managed to take me through the horrifying and debilitating journey through grief. She is one of the few actresses that can personify any character.Another outstanding performance was that of Milly Shapiro who played Charlie, the daughter. There was something eerie about her performance that I still can't explain but she really gave me the creeps whenever she was shown on the screen.And let us not forget Alex Wolff who played Peter, the son. His transition from a normal teenage boy to one dealing with overwhelming grief and guilt was slow but amazing. His eyes told you everything and I find him one of the best among the new generation of actors.As for the cinematography, I felt the movement of the camera and the camera angles added to the eerie atmosphere of the film and brought it's paranormal element to life. It felt as if you were a spirit watching the events unfold from every possible corner of the house. The choice of music was also done well and obviously chosen for a reason which managed to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up.Furthermore, when it comes to the genre of the film, I wouldn't categorise it as a horror per se because while there was a little bit of everything, it didn't horrify me as much as it left me feeling overwhelmed with emotion and somewhat depressed at the end. To me it felt more like a psychological thriller that took me on a harrowing journey through grief, depicting what the mind is capable of when you suffer the unbearable loss of a family member.All in all, I found the movie disturbing in the best way possible and will definitely recommend it to my family and friends. The great thing about movies are the fact that not everyone will experience them the same way. Finally, the best part of this movie was the fact that there was no sex scenes which proves that not every horror or thriller needs sex to sell.",Hereditary

The movie built up this idea of the mother and her side of the family having multiple serious mental illnesses, and through the title of the movie, you expect it to go down that road, but instead it just enters the plane of nonsense with demon worshipping, random decapitation and naked weirdo people. The very 'tragedy' that's supposed to propel the plot onwards was so ridiculously far out and stupid all I could do was gesticulate and repeat wtf at the screen. I mean, first the mom, obviously well knowing her son wants to go to a party to drink, forces his unwilling handicapped(??) highly allergic younger sister with him practically in order to force him to admit it's a party with booze (what a great strategy, mom!), but in his denial brings her with him anyway, both of them (the son and the mother) not thinking twice about making sure the sister brings her epipen, even though the movie already made a deal of underlining how important that was just moments earlier. Then in the brother's teenage rush to go smoke weed with the girl he's infatuated with, he just demands his odd fitting little sister to go eat cake that neither of them bother to consider what contains, her then running to him later with an allergic reaction as if it's her first time (we didn't see that coming..), he hurrying to the hospital in his mom's car while the sister is choking and dangling out the window then trying to avoid random dead dog and bike (???) on the dark road, neatly swaying the car for his sister's head to perfectly smack against the electricity pole on the side of the road, her head splatting off and thus putting herself out of her misery. Jesus effing Christ, I say. You doubled killed her, dude. Darwin award of the year. So in the brother's shock he just drives home in a catatonic state, goes to bed where he does not sleep, waits till his mother finds the decapitated body in the car and goes almost eternally bananas, and so we watch as the family spins out of control while having absolutely zero scenes of confrontation, explanation or anything with the son about the event itself. It's as if they send him straight off to school in his catatonic state as if he had nothing to do with the death in which he sits like a trauma victim that nobody noticed, parents, friends, teachers, nobody. Seriously, did nobody consider giving this guy emergency psychological aid?? What the hell, is all I can say. Then the mother's behavior just goes downhill and she even blames the son and wants him to take responsibility for the accident? Wat. And somehow we get from the poorly cut weirdo material of Darwin award death to decapitated grandma in the attic, demon spirits and devil worship, oh, and naked people. Always with the naked people in horror movies, mind you. Then Charlie (the double dead smacked sister) turns out to be dead headless granny's uhh demon spirit who had a faulty body (allergic? eh) and who has now been transfered to of course the totally well functioning male body with the broken nose who's just thrown himself out of a window from the attic floor. Very well functioning body! Can withstand much smack. I can't even. It was like a horror movie on crack. Also, what's with people never turning on the damn light when all scared in the dark at night, searching their damn house in full on darkness, or how about never calling the police, even when they are all alerted to miss headless granny rotting upstairs for no explicable reason? Aaah, there was no sense to this, and I fear for people's healthy skepticism that this movie has been this highly rated. Ugh. Okay, I'll stop rambling now.",Hereditary

1099,thdudeabides,Slow paced film takes too long to get going,6,10 August 2021,"Horror is my favourite genre and I rarely give in to any hype surrounding films that are supposedly the best yet in their own. This was one I gave in to and I have to admit I was disappointed.The film takes too long to set the scene, introduce characters and truly grip you. The film only starts to get interesting after an hour or so. Some inconclusive scenes have their answers revealed in subsequent ones through character interactions. This adds to the somewhat mysterious storyline and is designed to keep you focused but I found it to be a bit puzzling at times.The performances are really good, but as a drama more than anything elseThe films climax is hinted at late on in the film but it feels unsatisfying. There are some shocking scenes and interesting sequences leading up to it but the tension wasn't really there.Overall I felt the film was too long and more shocking than scary.",Hereditary
1100,aweynand96,"A shocking, disturbing, and genuinely terrifying glimpse into madness and grief",9,13 June 2018,"When the crowd starts hailing a new film as a ""masterpiece of horror,"" skeptic heads will turn. I'm a lifelong horror junkie and when I saw the (intentionally misleading) trailer for this movie I knew I had to see it. A24 has made some excellent horror entries in recent years and I expected another unique combination of both real scares and a really good film. I wasn't disappointed.The acting is exceptional. Toni Colette (as Anne Graham) flexes her potential and gives a frightening performance that channels all the anxiety and grief her character experiences. Alex Wolff surpasses expectations, and Gabriel Byrne does a fine job as well. The effect of their great performances is that you are entranced by the horror unfolding within their family - and you yourself are helplessly trapped along for the ride.I don't want to spoil anything and you should see Hereditary as blind as possible. It is truly a film of nightmarish proportions and I found myself nervously giggling like a paranoid child during two or three particular scenes. A large man to my left chuckled a couple of times in the first hour of the film, but was audibly afraid once the terror began to ramp up. At different points I was shocked, horrified, and wrought with anxiety, as director Ari Aster works to build the tension in a dream-like fashion until your nerves are bent to their breaking point.You won't find undeserved jump-scares or cheesy tropes in Hereditary. If you're a fan of psychological horror, supernatural horror, or really just good horror in general, this film will show you what kind of fear 127 minutes of runtime can induce. It is well-paced, craftily shot, and often very subtle in its detailing, and I am sure a re-watch will reveal some thoughtful or scary touches I missed before. And the scenes that are built to shock you will indeed do just that. This is the kind of film that shows you something unbelievably horrifying - and then makes you look at it for just a little too long.",Hereditary

1107,sbash22,Highly Entertaining Until The Bad Ending,6,21 November 2018,"Toni Collette's excellent acting held this movie together tightly and made it so memorable. Had a lesser actress been chosen for the lead role, the movie would have likely fallen apart long before it actually did and that was just at the final hurdle - the disappointing conclusion. The supporting cast all put on fine performances too, it should be noted so strong acting through and through. Good directing and cinematography too. I won't delve into the details here but will say that the ending of the movie was rather unoriginal - I remember watching old horrors from the 1970s with very similar occultist themes and endings. Certainly worth a watch as a horror fan but the ending cost this movie 2 stars so had it ended with a lot more originality I would have rated it an 8.
In the end, it gets a 6..",Hereditary
1108,jpq-89332,Not a horror movie,6,20 June 2018,"I think the mixed reviews for this movie is due to the fact that the movie was promoted as a horror movie when it wasn't.

It will definitely take you through some twists and turns.",Hereditary
1109,naturenomad,Biggest disappointment of 2018,1,9 June 2018,"Wow what can I say? I've been anticipating this film since hearing about it from Sundance. The problem with critics and the buzz surrounding this film was that it was way too hyped to the point where I was expecting the holy grail of terror. What me and my audience got was a decent and compelling start that crash lands into a comedy of errors. The film was just not terrifying nor was it goosebump inducing. I just stared blankly at the screen feeling muted and emotionless. I love slow burn horror and films that are filled with dread. This had a very good compelling premise but somehow the director decided to go artsy fartsy surreal pretentious in the final minutes of the film and boy did my audience groan and laugh. Trust me it was not nervous laughter but the kind you hear at a Farrelly brothers movie. Wait wasn't this suppose to be a horror film? How did it suddenly transform into a lame campy Mommie Dearest meets Rosemary's Baby unintentional comedy? Everyone booed and hissed on the way out of the theater. Literally the worst ending to a genre movie in ages. I was waiting for Natalie Portman to come out in black swan smeared kabuki make up and make some kind of cameo. This generations Exorcist? These critics are seriously deluded.Word-of-mouth from paying moviegoers will not be kind. Avoid unless you are a film student or love movies with godawful endings. I can see this being a Rocky Horror type of flick where audiences mouth click throughout the film and yell howlers at the screen like ""Don't you ever raise your voice at me, I am your mother!!!""",Hereditary
1110,janmarju,"Absolute garbage, a waste of time!",1,23 August 2018,The movie's description and what actually happens in this movie don't match up. Nothing in this movie made any sense.

The plot was ridiculous and uninteresting, the pacing was slow and for the most part nothing was happening in the movie, the characters were not representative of real life people and above all this movie WASN'T SCARY! Seriously, how can ANYBODY get scared watching this movie? I don't think that it's possible. There was no suspense, no tension and when they tried to create some, it just fell flat. I spent most of my time laughing at the ridiculousness of the script and characters.

1113,Icecreambenjaminelliott,An Instant Classic,10,3 July 2019,"This film will be spoken of alongside the likes of The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining in the future. Director Ari Aster takes his time in introducing characters, relationships, themes, and tone. It's what some would call ""a slow burn."" However, I think it's always interesting and always captivating. Aster sinks the audience so deep into what feel almost like a surreal, nightmare world right from the top of the film, so I never felt bored.Toni Collette gives the greatest horror performance of all time. Without a doubt. She's human, scary, tragic, and maniacal. Alex Wolfe also deserves a huge round of applause for giving one of the most realistic portrayals of a teenager in a horror film. His shock, grief, and guilt feel real and specific.Aster does give us some truly appalling scares and moments of absolute shock. The final scenes of this film are pure surreal horror. They feel deeply disturbing, deeply frightening, and immediately iconic.This is a modern classic.",Hereditary

It's one of those unique and different movies that's well worth seeing. It's quirky, shocking, terrifying and will make you very uneasy. And it stayed great until the very end when - they told us too much! If they'd left some things open-ended and subject to our own interpretation like VVitch or Annihilation it would have been perfect. Here's my recommendation. If you want everything explained in great detail, stay until the credits. If you want the unsettled and mysterious atmosphere of the movie to linger, wait until Peter goes to the tree house - at this point start gathering your stuff and start walking to the exit. Don't worry, there's not much of the movie left. But, don't exit just yet. A few more things happen, then - when you hear someone start talking, get out quickly! Now find some friends who did the same thing and discuss what you think was going on. It's a lot more fun this way.",Hereditary

But if you watch this film in a mood for ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", you would obtain a lot pleasure.It is so great to view this whole movie is surrounded by the dense atmosphere out of the mental pressure and the shadow of death. (And the acting is great. I like it so much.) Simple to say, grandma, mother and the beheaded dauther, which means the maternal side, are components in the blood line of Hereditary. Some details show that this family is set up to be sacrificed for Paimon and I think it can make sense. This movie also reveals the truth almost entirely so it's not hard to piece the mysterious hints at all.I think many people were upset because they wanted to see full jumpscares and enjoyed in the feeling of being frightened or scared. But ""Hereditary"" is obviously not that kind of movie. It actually is not only a horror film but a CULT film totally. Just like ""The VVitch""(2015 film), ""The Ritual""(2016 film) and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer""(2017 film). Some cult films have ghosts, but ""Hereditary"" just has the inapparent ghosts and strange happenings that makes people feel stunned in an instant. The only thing this film mostly emphasizes is RITUAL. Rituals make everything reasonable in this film, including causing the schizophrenia and the multiple personality disorder. Even this film is the part of the ritual. (Hah) At last, it seems that the ritual ended in Paimon gets his body. Pagans achieve their victory. On the whole, I consider it is a horror cult film about pagan's honorable road in the modern times.In the end, only one thing I must have to say: 
The biggest fault in this film is its special effect. It is a big fraction while watching. As I know, a few people laugh at mother's floating body and the following naked people in the ending scene. The laughter from audience in the theater makes all of it ridiculous. I don't mind people laughing, but I can't stand the special effect is too fake. Not real to make me feel horrible.",Hereditary

The characters in Hereditary seem so contrived, awkward and uncomfortable in their rolls, and we're left feeling confused about what's happening and why, until the end.Having said that, Toni Collette handles what little she is given to work with brilliantly.

I obviously look for the score a movie has in here but that doesn't put me down if I sense I should see this or that flick. 
I love horror since ever and I've seen the genre go through so many colors.One thing I am sure is there are movies for each one of you but this movie ain't for everyone and I'm sorry but not everyone gets what real cinema is about. I am being cruel, unpolite and showing political incorrectness but some of you here are just plain dumb or live in a planet of their own. 
Movies aren't supposed to be all the same and there are many ways to tell a story.
Hereditary is brilliant has it is.The cinematography,writing,directing,music,editing and actors performances are top-notch!
Toni Collette has an unbelieveble acting in this movie. This could be a drama!The fact that Gabriel Byrne's character is so small is incredible because that character has to be like that (a dimmed personality because there are people like that in real life ).Any actor with his status would want to shine a little bit more here but he does what he is suppose to do and 
give life to a character that is just half-visible. 
This movie mixes some old ideas together and doesn't bring many new ones to the table but who's being doing something new in the genre for the past decade?Few!
 Hereditary is slow paced but unfortunately this doesn't mean slow-minded people will get it.Slow pace isn't a bad thing for itself, man!Just stop whining about it. 
People who make bad reviews just for fun or based in their narrow minded entertainment experiences as viewers should first make a review of their lives and their tastes and their capacity to reach certain levels of cultural artistry.What I mean by this is you just waste time of your precious existence trolling and writting bad reviews about pieces of art that aren't bad or as bad as you state and the problem isn't the art but the subject viewer (YOU) that just can't get it thus gets annoyed and goes on a spiral of bullying against people who actually made an excellent job. 
Go and review bad movies (yes,there are a lot of them to be reviewed by you) if you wanna go that way .The ones you don't get,leave them alone or try to acquire some taste ,evolve,open your minds,I don't know...get a life and learn to be impartial on your reviews !

1144,shawnwu,Shocking and Beautiful,8,11 June 2018,"Hereditary was a terrifying blend of reality and the supernatural, with the horror stemming from the realism. The film was most terrifying when wallowing in the stress of tragic events and their effects on a strained family dynamic. Toni Collette and Alex Wolff delivered gut-wrenching performances as mother and son faced with impossible situations. The film also continuously hinted at an ambitious mythology that provided suspense, but in the last five minutes it felt the need to tie up the mystery with an over-explained sequence that read more like a conclusion to a Law and Order episode than the end to an otherwise excellent film. In all, the film was shocking and beautiful, but suffered from its last minute tonal shift.",Hereditary

But I do often enjoy horror movies, even if the characters don't act as human beings would and there are loose threads and there's no compelling story telling.I enjoyed Midsommar, The Witch, Babadook, The Conjuring, It Follows. Even though they all had plenty of faults, I was genuinely spooked and creeped out and intrigued.Hereditary was truly awful. It was meandering and lost at times, boring, annoying, and sometimes laughable. Plus it had more than the average number of faults that plague Hollywood movies.It had a high rating, so I persisted instead of shutting it off halfway through. I figured it must have some sort of compelling ending to earn a high rating and make up for the long, meandering, boring crawl. But the last quarter of the movie was the worst part of it. I groaned and I laughed and then groaned some more. Truly terrible.I won't go into all the details. It's not worth it. I'm just truly baffled how anyone could like this movie.",Hereditary

When people complained about Blade Runner 2049 being to long I thought about what I think could be left out, and I couldn't think of anything. 
The problem with Hereditary is, that it does build up a lot of tension, but in the end it doesn't deliver. Or at least you wish it wouldn't, because what you get is the lamest and most senseless plot revelation I got to see in any major production since... I don't even remember when. And worse than that: it's not even well executed. One special effect is so bad, it would have been laughable in the 80s. And what it shows is even totally unnecessary, as was already established one scene earlier. All in all it looks like a movie with a some good ideas for a family drama, which was then spoiled by some underdeveloped horror/mystery plot elements. 4 stars mainly for exceptional good acting and some very good dramatic scenes in the first half.",Hereditary
1148,tarantino_feet_pics,Quick thoughts on Hereditary,7,1 May 2020,"Hereditary is a breath a fresh air a stale horror genre. Instead of over reliance of jump scares and worn plot elements, Hereditary is unique in it's atmosphere and plot.A lot of praise is well deserved for the acting in particular Toni Collette as Annie and especially Milly Shapiro as Charli. Both are triumphant.The latter half of the movie builds suspense and a sense of uneasiness very well. With the cult circling in and the way they appear elated and malicious at the same time is horrifying. The gory scene in the attic is especially stomach turning.
The whole cult element is presented well, revealing slowly throughout the film. Use of a double dream sequence is a good presentation choice. Making the viewer unsure of what exactly is real and reveals a bit about Annie.The main fault of Hereditary is the first half is slow moving. Scenes drag and build as if something is going to happen but nothing never does. I found the first half hard to be engaged in and not too gripping.Overall Hereditary is a welcomed change to the genre that builds well in the second half and is genuinely scary but is held back by a dull first half.",Hereditary

The plot was a complete mess and just got worse as the movie went on. The movie achieved its climax quite fast and after the first 30 minutes or so I mostly hoped that something a bit more interesting would happen - but it didn't.I got scared - a bit - just once during the film, when something was suddenly thrown on the screen. There were similar ""whoaa silence is interrupted by lighting fast boogieman on the screen"" moments several times, but as I said, I got scared only once... Acting was rather dull, too.I'm not sure if the ant infested dead bodies should have been scary. But nowadays people see the real thing - deformed bodies, bloody bodies, burned bodies etc. - really easily in internet, so that kind of special effects don't really have any real potential to add suspension to any movie nowadays... maybe in the 1970s those would have been cool.Maybe, just maybe, the movie get some additional fame later on, because it was just so ridiculous...",Hereditary

1157,nickmrkonja,"Very good movie, but a biiiit on the overrated side...",7,6 December 2020,"...But the only reason I say it's overrated is because people refer to it as though it's the greatest horror film ever made. It really is a great movie, infinitely better than the mainstream, jump-scare-a-thon, no story having horror schlock they put out every year, BUT I just don't think it's the perfect, penultimate movie that some make it out to be.Having said that, it definitely is a cool, slow burn film. It makes excellent use of the tension as soon as IT happens (anyone who's seen it will know to what I'm referring) and really doesn't let up til the climax... which is an intensely crazy and creative climax, at that (ala The Shining).The first time I saw it, I was in a halfway house with about 15 or so of the other guys all watching. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have NEVER heard so much complaining in my entire life. Maybe it's the fact that people born as far back as the 80s just get bored when movies have actual stories that make you think...Like try to get someone in their 20s or 30s to sit down and watch a Hitchcock film or a 40s film noir, and they'll be playing on their phone, bored to tears within 15 mins. It's sad because I grew up with an appreciation for the classics, and therefore, movies with substance, depth, and a STORY. Everyone wants stupid slapstick comedy where Will Farrell once again plays a complete oblivious, buffoon with a heart of gold, or a horror movie where the ghost/demon/killer appears BEHIND the protagonist where they can't see it for about 75 minutes before the anticlimactic climax where it tries to finally kill them the last 10 mins (I never understood that... what exactly is the ghost accomplishing by staring or walking past ALWAYS from behind? These directors need to put some thought into it).But I digress... very good movie. Not perfect, but very good. Very good acting as well. When Toni Collette is wigging out at the end and spouting all this insane, obnoxious sounding stuff at Gabriel Byrne as he stands there with that ""my wife has finally gone off the deep end"" expression on his face, I totally started hating her. After all, so much of it was her fault and her extremely unattractive face which she contorts like playdough the whole time makes it so much easier to hate her.

It constantly wrings you out like a wet rag with its jet black view of a family on the brink of destruction. It's a film that will leave you batting images and sounds around in your head long after you have left the cineplex. 
One of the major reasons why is because Writer/Director Art Aster has created an astounding peice of work here, part of this film can be considered a dark family drama. The other side of this film's coin can be considered to be some of the finest American horror that has ever been put to screen. The film also features a damaging yet beautiful performance by Toni Colette. They layers of pain begin to outweigh the layers of loss, which begin to flake away into broken layers of psychological damage. As she loses her grip on reality Toni Collete begins to form one of the greatest female performances of recent memory. Stunning work. And the mantle piece of this film.",Hereditary

Instead it devolved into a second rate creep show that overused gore, death and unexplained revelations. For so much trauma to be visited upon one family gave me horror fatigue during the last half of this film. In a review by NPR, the writer and director Ari Aster, says that he, ""wanted the film to function first as a vivid family drama before I even bothered attending to the horror elements"". In this aim he certainly does succeed, owing to the brilliant performances of the cast and moments of writing genius. Aster says that the turning point of the film was ""designed to operate like a chute that opens up under audience and kind of drops them into hell"". Aster also says in a Vanity Fair interview that he ""wanted to make a film that served as a serious meditation on grief and trauma."" In these objectives he ultimately fails because he uses the gimmick of horror, inspired by Rosemary's Baby, Psycho, and other similar movies, to try take us down a rabbit hole of the supernatural, instead of exploring the non-supernatural horror of their situation. The real terror is invoked by the riveting performances of the actors, especially Toni Collette, whose character's grief and suffering touched me more deeply than desecrated graves, headless corpses and hovering evil monsters ever could. Alex Wolff also gets kudos for his heartbreaking depiction of teenage angst taken to the extremes. But, the supernatural elements of the film left me completely cold. It seemed like the easy way out for Aster who convinced me that he didn't know where to take the real horror that such misfortune can engender.",Hereditary

No spoilers here but needless to say that it certainly didn't disappoint. Hereditary is a slow burner of a horror film that concentrates on the drama surrounding a family dealing with grief and psychological issues due to their families past. As the film progresses the tension increases thanks in part to the incredible throbbing and foreboding film score. A sense of dread permeates throughout the film even when nothing truly unsettling is happening. As we approach the final act the horror really becomes terrifying and the spine tingles begin. A couple of scenes are notably scary as hell! The narrative is superbly structured so that it keeps you guessing until the very end. Performances are all great but Toni Collette is quite simply breathtaking. She really did absorb and embody the role of the grieving Annie.
Ari Aster has crafted a brilliant family drama with chilling horror elements that I'll be very happy to revisit time and time again.",Hereditary

The accident scene was one of the most socking movie moments of all time for me. I almost cried and it took me a while until I recovered myself from its psychological effect. Then, it went on very well with the help of great acting skills of all leading actors. I would definitely vote 10/10 for the movie if it had not been for the last 10 - 15 minutes - the final scenes of the movie. It was such a cliche, third class horror movie ending. It was truly disappointing for me. I think this could have been one of the all-time classic thriller movies otherwise.I would like to emphasize once again the acting was superb.

This has all the cliches of a typical horror film. But it's the way the film has done it, you forget all the cliches. This isn't any ordinary horror film. It's not exciting as The Conjuring or Insidious, it'snot fast pace or has consistent jump scares, it's actually the opposite of that. It's a slow pace family drama with the element of horror.The film starts with a family tragedy which slowly turns into a nightmare. We have Annie going through the struggle after losing her mother. We have Peter filled with regret and who slowly goes insane, but the most interesting character is Charlie. She has always felt different, never felt connected with the rest of the world, she was born this way. It's kind of a sick, twisted, true analogy about having a mental disorder.

Toni Collette deserved an oscar nomination for this movie she was amazing.One thing I will say about this movie is that the marketing is quite different from the movie, they market it as if Charlie is in this terrifying spooky movie. SPOILERS, she dies 30 mins in and seeing Alex wolf's eyes knowing what he did and how much you can feel just from his expression. Oh my God this movie is on another level. I felt what the movie was trying to make us feel.I felt horrible for annie when Charlie died, I felt awful for the dad trying to keep his family together, I felt awkward when they were at their grandmother's funeral. I felt terrified for Peter after Charlie died. I felt awful for Peter cause he couldnt help what happened and his mom resented him for it. I felt happy, yet creeped out when they did the whole seance thing.Another point of emphasis is the soundtrack, it is breathtaking, it is like on the same level of it follows with how good it sounds, and it actually makes you feel the emotions.

Unfortunately, I was massively let down.The first hour of the movie or so was just following the life of a family that just buried grandma, nothing out of the ordinary, except for the characters at sometimes think they see something out of the corner of their eyes (but this wasn't scary and is just normal when mourning a lost family member). My friend and I were honestly wondering if we had wandered into the wrong movie. It was all drama, no horror and no mystery. It wasn't bad per se, just bland, chugging forward without much of anything happening.Then halfway through some abnormal things do start happening and we briefly hoped the true horror would start, but unfortunately it then quickly just moved from the bland to the bizarre, showing things that just didn't seem to make any sense (and still absolutely not scary).Performances were weak as well. Peter (Alex Wolff) seemed to have the emotional range of a cucumber, only ever showing either typical teenager apathy, or crybaby 'why are you hurting me' type of scared (no, true terror looks very different). Steve (Gabriel Byrne) was pretty bland as well, just sort of being there, and also unconvincing in believing his wife is just having a mental breakdown even after witnessing convincing paranormal effects. Annie (Toni Collette) was the best, but the problem here was she was just unlikable. I truly didn't care about what happened to her.The story meanwhile was quite simple, pretty predictable and left some pretty big plotholes. At the end we're led to believe that the entire thing was pre-planned, but what about the accident? Yeah, maybe that thing on the road was planned, but everything else just seemed random. Also, the head coming off was totally unbelievable, that would never happen in an accident like that. Other things seemed very random as well, why did the fire suddenly jump to Steve? Completely unexplained and also failed to convey any kind of feeling (""oh, that guy burns? why?"" was all the reaction it got from me)In short, while the movie wasn't painful to watch, it was also completely devoid of any impact and I'll be forgetting about it soon.

First of all, no parent would insist an older teen take his young sister to a party, then once there, he, (knowing she has a peanut allergy, and no Epi-pen sends her into a kitchen full of drunk/high teens to eat, while he goes into another room to smoke weed. Uhhuh... As she goes into shock he doesn't call 911, but instead throws her into his car and races off, Hmmmm...Just as she hangs out the window, an animal appears and he has to swerve. Nice timing animal! None of this is even remotely plausible and it gets worse from there. Much, much worse.Killing off the only interesting character early on, was bad enough, the prolonged shock/grief that follows is hugely depressing, and then there is nothing to redeem having been forced to feel that bad, because there is no Horror Story in the end, just a jumble of gory imagery and a weak attempt to tie it together with a supernatural slant. It just doesn't work.",Hereditary

1185,chazthegamr,The First Spark of 2018,8,18 June 2018,"I think that we can all agree that 2018 has been a lukewarm year for films, it seems like we've had almost any entire year of nothing but cash grabs and historical dramas while most of the true classics are yet to be discovered. Thankfully, this year is starting to shine with Hereditary.Hereditary seems to be part of a bach in the growing amount of slow burners, and as of right now all of these burners have been great. Last year we received the masterpiece It Comes at Night, and the year before we received yet another masterpiece The Witch.However in-comparison to those films, Hereditary is the first film out of the bunch which has scared me relentlessly. But not just that, the film had me shaking and breathing heavily throughout while the film teased me with the potential shocker.
This film is excellent at subverting your expectations just like The Witch and It Comes at Night. There are many instances where the film displays a large window or a mirror right next to a character to tease you into believing that a potential jumpscare may spring, however instead of giving into this cliche, the film utilises this expectation to prolong its brooding tension, further brought to life by its equally brooding soundtrack and pacing.However, this film doesn't get a free pass for simply scaring me, this fear works due to its developed characters, most of whom are responsible for the evoked tension. The performance by Toni Collette is simply stunning, she authentically portrays her character while fleshing out some of the more perturbing personality features that manifest later in the film.I didn't really have a problem with any other performance except for a few spots of Alex Wolff's performance, for the most part he solidified the authenticity although in a few noticeable occasions he inaccurately portrayed some of the intended emotions which lead to a little bit of unintentional amusement.As well as my mixed thoughts on Alex Wolff's performance, I found that the pacing and the tension didn't entirely work to the film's advantage. Due to the fact that the tension for the film started building up from 10 minutes onwards, there were many occasions where I became de-sensitised and a little unengaged to the film due to the fact that the tension stood still for a while. This may seem trivial, although it was a feeling that detracted a tiny bit of my care from the film.Despite having stated that, this film is right near the top of my list of films released in 2018, there are many shot decisions and stylistic choices that have likely inspired my craft.One of my favourite shots from the film is the one in which Charlie sees her grandmother standing amidst a fire. The shot evokes a real eerie vibe due to the fact that it juxtaposes the reality of the film. In terms of my favourite stylistic decision I loved the films' quick contrast between the perspective of Nat Wolfe's character and the main actress, another is the films' depiction of the spirits, they manifest a sleep paralysis quality which further enables them to evoke tension due to the personal resonance.As I'm certain, most have discussed the subtle details listed in this film, and due to my love, I feel motivated to watch the film again to see details which I didn't catch the first time round.For a debut film, Aster should be extremely proud of his achievements, and I hope that this praise will motivate you to expand upon your capabilities and confidence.",Hereditary

The plot in this felt like a 6, maybe 6.5, one of those horror films you can say ""oh yeah, I've seen that"" and wouldn't mind watching it again for kicks, but I wasn't at all glued to my seat. Throughout the whole film, I never stopped asking myself ""why was there NO police investigation carried out following Charlie's death? That's felony DUI right there.""That, and that alone, not even the whole Paimon cult thing, served as a constant reminder that this is nothing but a work of fiction. And I also felt that Peter was reduced to nothing but what seemed like a plot device. He was always no more than a medium for delivery, and that he was.I have to give an extra star for Toni Colette's performance, though.

What looked like shaping up to be a slow moving yet interesting build towards a tense scary ending proved to be a slow road to nowhere.Well, actually, the movie did actually go somewhere, just to a load of silliness.Granny dies and the family who didn't really like her are grieving yet not grieving because granny was apparently a cantankerous, controlling and bossy woman and all those bad things grannies can be.She clearly had a plan for her grandchildren who are couple of the most troubled children you could hope to come across.

I finally watched Hereditary earlier this week and I must say it was one of the most disturbing, unsettling films I have seen to date. I am a HUGE film fanatic, all genres included. I noticed others make the comment saying they had to watch it two or three times to understand the concept of the movie. In my case, I understood the movie the first time I watched it. I was in no need of any validation or confirmation. The music and sound affects made the film incredibly unsettling and so did the camera work (angles, lighting, transitions etc). The ending was slightly obscure, in my opinion, but what horror movie doesn't have any cliche, silly aspects. If anything, Hereditary' execution was in much less of an elementary way. There were several times my stomach truly churned in disgust- hard to explain. I appreciate a good horror movie. One that is not far fetched or even unintentionally comical. Hereditary was able to provide me with that feeling of watching a good horror film. I didn't give the film a 10 because I truly believe there is no horror movie to date that deserves a 10/10. I think theres years of experimentation needed to stretch the genre in a certain way and develop new, more realistic ways at scaring people- if that makes sense.

One quick impression is that the makers of this film are counting on repeated viewings in order for people to follow what the hell was happening. The film wasn't really scary. But very unsettling. Don't know about anyone else thinks, but the trailer was very deceptive. It gave the impression the homely character Charlie would play more of a role in the film; this was not the case. Best horror movie of the year? Hardly. Worthy of an ""8"" collective rating on IMdb so far? Hardly.

And frankly, a lot of the movies that this one is compared to got it right. This just felt like they ran out of gas, and tried to tie it together with something that will scare Catholics...and just to make it work for everyone else, by adding a ton of weird gore. Let's face it...if King Paimon is really the badass demon that the legends say he was, he didn't need a goofy group of ""satanist"" if he wanted to show up and take control. Oh well... a lot of fun.

I've seen others who dislike it say it's ""too artsy""...that's lame. I've seen others who love it, say ""mainstream audiences just don't get it and are dumb""..that too is lame. I adore films that try new things and/or don't answer all the questions. The slower the burn the better, but Hereditary had very little fire to burn. There just isn't much here. The title says it all, craziness runs in the family..it's hereditary. I get it. The film meandered until it just became limp and goofy. If you want to see a truly bizarre and creepy film, see last year's The Killing Of A Sacred Deer - It's not horror but it's often horrific and electrifying. Hereditary has a nice creepy start then dissipates into thin air. The acting is fine (especially the young male lead) and it looks great. Unfortunately, in my (experienced horror film connoisseur) opinion there was no ground broken here. If you're in the mood for a real slow burn chiller, see Peter Medak's 1980 film The Changeling.",Hereditary

I was expecting no supernatural events yet there were and I thought they were done very well. There were a few scenes where I almost cried because I really felt for Toni Collete's character and her behaviour quite drove it home. There were a few scenes where I was just gaping in awe or horror and I think if a movie can provoke that response out of me, then it at least deserves a but of praise on that part. I felt the movie built up at a slow pace but it worked and the scares got more frequent and intense.If I had to complain it would be about the ending, maybe over done or over reached but at least it felt a little different.

1222,deathswagga,Decent modern horror with mild scares,5,7 December 2020,"This movie succeeds in being a perfectly average and typical modern horror movie, and not much more. The drama is pretty good, especially in the 1st act. The acting is amazing overall, with an incredible performance from the mother and a mostly great performance from the son, but some scenes are so poorly acted (such as whenever the son is crying) they're cringe/laughable. An unexpected event early on was very shocking but paved the way for some phenomenal acting scenes, and some really creepy horror moments.Unfortunately the writing and plot is absolute bonkers and drags the whole movie down. The end twist is silly and for me it effectively reduced the horror of the movie. Basically everything is relying on a series of many, many perfect coincidences and/or plain magic. And with the amount of magic/luck necessary to ensure every single event happens perfectly, it just doesn't make sense why it needs to happen in such a long roundabout way other than for screen time and to allow for horror moments. Towards the end, some horror moments also border on comedic, like when you see someone randomly Spiderman crawling on walls and then flying and smacking their head on the ceiling upsidedown.This movie works more as a good drama due to some exceptional acting and the shocking twist near the beginning, but slowly descends in quality as the horror elements become more contrived and silly. I did not find this movie very scary in the 2nd half. And if I ever rewatched I doubt any of it would seem scary anymore. The acting of all the characters are good, but the characters themselves are often unlikeable, unbelievable and commonly make multiple dumb decisions that make no sense apart from magic and plot reasons. In fact the movie goes as far as the excuse of magic being the reason for the dumbest out-of-character moments.If the movie needs to explain why characters make so many bad and dumb mistakes then maybe the plot shouldn't require such retarded characters in the first place. But at least there technically is a canon reason for the many stupid character mistakes.To conclude, I found the plot and writing dumb, but because of the acting and some drama/horror scenes, I consider this a decent modern horror movie. It's certainly good at subverting expectations so it's best to watch the movie without knowing any twists. But there's nothing really special about this movie; it's just a pretty good and kinda scary modern horror movie.",Hereditary

It played on emotion and drama so well and actually made the characters worth investing in so that when the terrible things happen it's that more impactful and shocking (which is something that usually gets left behind in horror, which is so refreshing). As the movie draws closer to the end though, that mood seems to get completely thrown out the window in favor of the typical horror cliches. The end feels hastily thrown together leaving one confused and unsatisfied when the movie ends. The story had these great characters but just didn't seem to know what to do with them or where it was even going.

I had been looking forward to watching this film as it had very good reviews and hyped up. Don't waste your time",Hereditary
1233,tjpierce-84253,A Long Day's Journey Into the Occult,5,9 June 2018,"This generations Exorcist? Mm no. More like our Burnt Offerings. There are some good things here, but what a mess. I was impatient and fidgeting through the entire thing, and judging from all the cell-phone browsing, many others were as well. Where to begin?Okay, first, if your movie is heading into the heavy occult, there ought to be some clear foreshadowing and a somewhat crisp, linear path, sprinkled with recognizeable clues, for us to follow, rather than the murky, glacial slog that comprises most of this flick. It's just all over the place, and sloooowly. The events that might have been clues are presented as happenstance, e.g., Mom's attendence at a grief support group. What's more, she appears to begin the story a few cards short of a full deck, so her unraveling into madness becomes predictable, overwrought and, frankly, tiresome.Then there is the WTF plot device of Peter taking his 13-year-old sister to a high school party. In what universe? It's silly and jars our willingness to suspend disbelief. And Peter himself, the natural son of this utterly Anglo couple, has obvious South-Asian genetics. You can do this kind of color-creative casting on stage, which is more like French Impressionist painting, but film is literally photography, and this casting is a puzzling visual non-sequitur. Are we supposed to wonder about Mom snagging an illicit quickie in the storeroom of the 7-Eleven? Was Ben Kingsley replaced as the father after shooting began? Yes, nagging questions.Most of the inanities lie in the pace and story structure, garnering unintentional guffaws from the audience during what should be solemn moments. I liked where the story ended up, but felt ill-prepared for the arrival. Oh well, I guess Roman Polanski wasn't available for the rewrite.",Hereditary
1234,harleysbatman,Over Hyped And Falsely Marketed,6,14 June 2018,"The thing is, I was REALLY looking forward to this movie. I was hooked from the first time I saw the trailer. The marketing and editing of the trailer was brilliant. It made me feel as though this was the next big thing in Horror movies. I felt hyped to see this movie! I even made jokes to my fiancee that I was going to be holding onto her, all during the movie and not to tell anyone if I ended up screaming or crying too loudly. I did not scream. I did not cry. I mostly laughed. Oh Zod, how I laughed out loud at this movie! That's when it clicked in my head that I had been suckered in by Hereditary...The problem with this movie, in my opinion, isn't that it's a bit slow in pace or tone; nor is it that the movie bait and switches the hell out of you---NO! The problem is that Hereditary believes its own hype; explains nothing and pats itself on the back for getting, to what equates to, a Participation Trophy! Listen, this movie isn't entirely bad or unwatchable---it has some great acting, scenes and ambiance---but it doesn't know what it wants to be. Honestly, it works better as a Drama, Suspense or Thriller but not as a half baked Horror film. Here are my thoughts on Hereditary; both good and bad:The Good:The acting in this film is very good (except for the dude who played the son) and believable. The mother gives very real reactions (mostly---she can over do it a bit) and you can feel her emotional exhaustion. The little girl who plays Charlie is very good in her role and I hope she continues to do other movies. She wasn't in the film for very long, but she did her best with what she had to work with. Most of the shots were used very well and added to the suspense. I even believe the director used a similar shot from The Shining in one scene. When Charlie dies, I felt horrible for the child. That was my emotional attachment to the movie. I was invested in the character and I was surprised when she was killed off, so early in the film. Regretfully, this is the end of the positive praises I have for Hereditary.The Bad:Oh Zod, where do I begin? I'll start with the obvious: THIS FILM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GENETICS! Watching the trailer, you might believe that the film is about a little girl, possible mentally ill or with supernatural powers, due to her genetics (why else call the damn thing Hereditary?!), that is getting out of control or is in some kind of peril. Or something along those lines. What you REALLY get is a film that has ZERO to do with this child (who the film maker makes the focus of the trailer!), ZERO to do with genetics and all things hereditary and an ending so stupid, it gives Mother! a run for its money! The movie does address (very poorly and vaguely) that some mental illness does run in the family and that the mother has even (unintentionally) tried to kill her children but at the end of the day, it isn't needed or important because the Big Bad here is Zhuul or Satan or some Devil King (who, I swear to Zod, wears a cheap looking Jugghead Crown)!
I mean, imagine that for two hours, there's this guy who keeps talking about how he hates rice. This rice has done something to this poor guy, no doubt. Rice has to play into this story somehow! Then all of a sudden, the devil comes and kills him, puts on a stupid crown and leaves. The end. WHAT ABOUT THE DAMN RICE?! That's what this movie was. A bunch of talk and no good explanations. Speaking of which: Why? WHY?! That's all I could say after viewing this. Why did they make Little Charlie appear to be troubled, just to kill her off with no pay off? Why does the mom or any of the others in the family not know that Grandma is in a cult? Grandma was said to be this private woman but she literally leaves the mom nothing but Occult items! Why does the son cry like a cartoon baby? Why does the mom let a small teen go to a party with much older teens? Why does Charlie hide candy? Why does the dad go from being comforting to not having it overnight? Why was Charlie the grandma's favorite (assuming that she believed this was the Devil King) and not the actual MALE child? It's like she bent over backwards for this Devil King dude! In the end, there's just more questions; questions that lead to more questions and questions I never thought I'd ask. The bottom line to me is that people are going to walk out of the film thinking that the mentally ill are evil and are satanists and all that type of Stigma. I know it's true because I heard it myself! They used mental illness as the scapegoat for a cult movie. That's all Hereditary is: A movie about a grandma, who was a devil worshiper, who believed her deity was her granddaughter but wanted to be a boy, so somehow she kills her favorite grandchild so that her deity could then go inside her 2nd favorite one. Or something like that. It's STUPID!6 out of 10 for effort...",Hereditary

A cliche riddled film that robs from of lots of classic horrors but fails to deliver. A cast of very unlikable characters moping and feeling very sorry for themselves. I very quickly couldn't care less what happened to any them. Hereditary tries to be clever and intriguing but to me the real story is fairly obvious- in fact there's a big clue in the title.

1249,prostrateconstantly,An Empty Little Rollercoaster,1,10 March 2020,"Films are a method of communication. It is up to filmmakers to articulate ideas, which can be aesthetic or intellectual.What preconception does is gives filmmakers a shortcut. It's like the use of stock phrases or buzzwords in a conversation. They can be used to establish a common basis, which can then be continued from tangentially to communicate something new. However, if they are relied on heavily they can be used to cover up a lack of substance to be communicated.Ari Aster is a filmmaker who operates entirely in preconception, without anything being taken further on his part to articulate anything new. Every work starts out with something taboo or seductive ( grieving, breakups) and goes through the most obvious, surface level aspects of these topics and iconography of the central genre trappings both ineffectively, and while refusing to articulate anything that could allow for any form of progression.His films are successful because Aster has a strong interest in the primal, emotive aspects of film. The films he's enjoyed have a strong initial impact, and even if they've articulated something meaningfully in another aspect he has ignored it in favor of the initial emotional response. His films are inoffensive and operate within the expectation of both a work of ""art horror"" and the work of an ""auteur talent"" that the emotional response is not overridden.We need to look deeper than this initial emotional response if we want film to be a meaningful method of communication. This is especially important since film requires a greater investment both financially and in terms of external involvement than other mediums. To base our opinions, and therefore popular canon, on pure initial emotional response, we misdirect our attention and potentially deprive more articulate filmmakers the opportunity to express themselves.",Hereditary

The tension is increased as the plot twists its broken bottle deeper and deeper into your mind until it's hard to breathe and imposssible to look away. As always it's easy to say that any movie isn't scary - it's the audiences job to be in the right head space in order to put themselves in a state of vulnerability so they can appreciate the terror that the film is supposed to create.Put yourself in the right frame of mind to be scared, grab some popcorn and keep the light on.",Hereditary

And it doesn't. Then you are forced to enter the Lovecraftian world of the unseen.I totally understand how that can be frustrating, especially for modern audiences.It's not a tour de force, but it works. And I almost think selling it as a pure horror film does it a disservice. This is a drama about grief. About the ravages of mental illness.And it's just gorgeous to look at.

1261,wemme,"Gorgeous, horrific and tragic",10,29 December 2018,"I've become obsessed with this film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after having seen it. I find it hard to talk about or pinpoint, as there are so many levels to explore in its narrative and theme.The core of this movie is the passed down trauma, pain and illness that we receive from our parents. Hereditary seems to suggest that we can't control anything in our own lives; as if something or someone else is in control of our fate, whether that be a genetic code, our social environment or... something else. Hereditary takes this idea and does what the horror genre does best; it incarnates it into a tangible monster that aims to destroy us and everyone we hold dear.As I watched this movie I was having one of the most intense cinema experiences of my life. I was clinging to my chair, shaking in my seat, gasping for air. Hereditary is not a slow, cold, silent horror movie. It's loud, it's banging, it's punching your gut repeatedly. It's graphic and raw and it doesn't flinch from the grittiest of emotions in the human spectrum. This makes the scares all the more effective, because you're overwhelmed with empathy for the characters. And as the movie was nearing its climax and I was holding on for dear life, I seem to hear the audience in the room chuckling. I could hear their exasperation as the credits rolled. That may be your reaction too, but I'd like to think that has to do with expectations going into it. more than the actual quality of the film. I don't think you should be expecting the scariest horror movie ever made.
So let's talk about the infamous ending, which seems to split audiences down the middle. Without giving anything away, I belive it to be one of the most tragically beautiful depicitions of fate and hereditary ailment ever put to screen. I especially encourage you to look at the framing of the last shot of the movie, compare it to the very first opening image, and from there I hope you can understand the choices Aster made. The following weeks after having seen Hereditary I was unbelievably frustrated. Everywhere on the internet I tried to read reviews and analyses of the film and its ending, but everyone seemed to take it so literally. If you're going into the movie completely unknowing, I'd advise you to feel the ending, experience the ending, instead of understanding it as some kind of realistic depiction. For what is film but a tool to concretize and manifest abstract concepts into gorgeous, tragic spectacles.",Hereditary

In addition to that, I have to disagree with whom states it is a well directed movie. It is not, as the director uses 2 hours whereas the first could be done in 20 minutes, while the movie really happens in the last 30 minutes.

1275,kylesasman,I understand both the hate and the love,10,15 September 2018,"I understand the people who hated this film, thought it was boring and trashy. Yet I also understand why people thought it was deeply disturbing and phenomenal. I saw this in theaters with my dad. Let's talk about the people who hated it. First of all, I am someone who gets irritated when people laugh in the theaters during a scary movie. But, there were some corny things happening in the movie that genuinely made me laugh (some of Peter's crying made me cringe, when the mother named Annie chops her head off super fast, and when she floats around in the air when she is possessed. I actually thought it was so funny. Also, when I first saw this I had no idea what was happening. The movie is a little too unclear. I do remember being tired in the theater and maybe I wasnt paying fully attention though, but I remember telling my friends that it was so confusing that I wasn't even sure if I could tell them what it's about. The movie seems slow to people. BUT (for the people who love it including myself) I watched it again/looked some things up. And this movie is quite a trip let me tell you. Even when I first saw it, I did think it was quite disturbing and horrifying and was satisfied because I felt as if I haven't seen a movie that scary in very long, even though I genuinely laughed at some parts. This movie makes you uncomfortable. And the reason for that is because in this movie you're literally watching a family's relationship deteriorate to absolute dirt in the most insane ways possible. And most of us have a family we live with, and seeing the characters/family fall apart and seeing the people that are going crazy after all these horrifying and traumatic events happening to them is terrifying to me. This movie is slow at first but it's for the purpose of you getting to know the characters, so later you can be upset and disturbed, and in shock about how all of them are dying in brutal ways. And lastly, to me what makes this movie so disturbing is that 95% of the acting is absolutely superb. Especially from Annie, the mother and the son Peter. Watching Annie go insane makes this movie heartbreaking and so dark and disturbing. Take this movie with an open mind and go watch it :-)",Hereditary
1276,kylesasman,I'll tell you exactly why it's so horrifying.,10,25 December 2018,"I can actually completely understand why some people perceive this movie as god awful (wont really explain that- not the point I want to make in my personal review) The first time I saw it I didn't like it but now I'm in love and just got this movie for Christmas. I am a giant horror movie fan and almost watch strictly horror movies, so you already know I don't scare easily. I want to tell everyone why this movie left me so unsettled and disturbed when I saw it the second time in theaters (no spoilers, no worries) This movie takes a family (which we all have) and shows all of them falling apart in the most dark, sinister messed up ways you could ever possibly imagine. And that's what makes it so real. We all have families and go through dark and tough times. You FEEL for EVERY character in this movie. The acting is one of the biggest reasons that makes the film so unsettling. I could not imagine a different cast, especially having someone else play the mother, Annie and the son, Peter. This movie seems slow, and dragged on at first. But the way the events unfold is ABSOLUTELY INSANE. Also, for one- there's hardly any jump scares. This movie is pure terror with brilliant acting, along with the fact that every time I watch it, I notice something new. People lurking in corners and strange places that I never saw previous times, terrifying yet sublte and quiet sounds and effects you never caught or heard before throughout the film. It's so simple yet brilliant. And let's not forget how the whole concept of this movie is messed up, with awfully disturbing imagery. I feel like if any of you are reading this review and you're not sure of what to do because of other negative reviews, just give it a chance! Have an open mind, pay attention to details. I feel that you won't be dissappointed. Enter the realm of hell that IS ""Hereditary."" Amazing, dark film. You will be horrified. Scariest movie I will probably ever see. 15/10.",Hereditary
1277,rmailander,A Sublime Psychological Horror Film That Really Gets Into Your Head,10,22 March 2020,Hereditary stars Toni Collette; in a flawless performance as a woman on the verge who goes back to her mother's home to bury her and ends up staying with her husband (Gabriel Byrne) and two children (Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro) in the home; which emits a sense of utter dread and alienation. The more that Collette digs; the deeper the terror grows. A brilliant climax and all-around superlative performances from a well-suited cast make Hereditary a contender for the best horror film of the 2010s.,Hereditary
1278,jessica_span-83665,Good but slow..,7,10 November 2018,"I like a good supernatural scare movie. The cast is excellently chosen and acting is really good. The overall feel, music, irie vibe of the movie is good from the beginning. Its starts creepy and strange and the pace of the story telling is fine Going along, the pace slows down and as a viewer you wonder with a sigh when something really catching is going to happen and the plot going to unravel.
All that is told can also be told in 1 hour and a half, making it uneccesarily long and in danger of the ""bring it on!"" reaction of the viewer.In spite of the pace, I do recommend the movie for the lover. It is definately no cheesy supernatural/horror movie.",Hereditary

Without giving away any spoilers, the ending ties it all together in a way that's so gratifying and unnerving in its historical accuracy. Horror fans will love this film, and real occultists will find it deeply rewarding.",Hereditary
1281,The_Dman313,The Loneliness of Loss,8,21 December 2018,"It is quite rare that you get a horror film that is both scary and complex. One that takes a deep look into human emotions and then shifts it into a tense thrill ride. This rarity has arrived just this year. Its name: Hereditary.This diamond in the rough film centers on the character of Annie (played by Toni Collette), a mother who finds it hard to cope with the loss of her mother and another family member. She is accompanied by her son Peter (played by Alex Wolff), a regular stoner teen, and his dad, Steve (played by Gabriel Byrne), who has trouble dealing with his wife's questionable behavior. From this, I cannot give too much away. I will say that this film is in fact quite scary, with many of its supernatural moments destined to get a scream out of audience members. I will also say that it includes many themes of loss all communicated with immense creativity, as it infests the story metaphorically in various different ways.Starting off, one obvious pro of this film is its acting. It is incredibly life like, making all the supernatural moments all the more disturbing to sit through. Definitely the stand out in this film is that of Toni Collette. She goes through a wide variety of emotions, all of which to the greatest extreme, including depression, happiness, hopefulness, and insanity. Each is done with such precision, that it feels similar to watching a dancer pull off an incredibly complex dance, hitting each move perfectly. Another standoff performance would have to be that of Alex Wolff who plays Peter. From the beginning he does an exploratory job of manifesting the stoner teen, but it's when the film continues, and he is introduced to more and more of the horrors that this film has to offer, that he is allowed to truly shine. Alex himself has even stated in an interview for Goldderby, ""I have never been this vulnerable; if someone touched me I would bleed."".What compelled me most when it came to this film's scares was simply how unconventionally it dealt with it. For example: around ¼ of the way into this film a character, while in a car, gets decapitated. While most R rated horror films from here would have its focus be the gore, how the body looks and how much blood there is, Hereditary instead focuses completely on the character driving the car. The camera lingers on his shock ridden face and his shaky hands, holding there for about a minute, simply letting the actor portray everything about the character in that moment. Not only is this scene scary, but it allows viewers to take a breath with the character and try to comprehend how this action will affect everyone for the rest of the film.Yet another aspect that this film excels at is its visual style. The majority of the scenes inside the family's house is filmed from a distance, encompassing the entire room, and in the process engulfing the characters. This gives us a view as a spectator, making us feel as if they are dolls inside of a doll house. To me, this gives a whole new perspective of how the film should be viewed, giving off a paranoia that possibly we are not the only ones viewing it, that this is from the evil spirits point of view, viewing them all as inconsequential dolls that they have control over.That is only one of many interpretations, which viewers will probably have many of. This is largely due to the fact that the film is very vague with what is actually going on, leading to more questions than it does answer. This works to the film's benefit for the most part, until the last 10 minutes of the film. It is at this point that I felt as if this film was jumping the gun, leading me to question what exactly was going on, and most likely prompting many viewers to look up ""Hereditary ending explained"" on Youtube.I will end on a warning: for those movie-goers expecting a horror movie that dwells on its blood, gore, and exploitation, you may not enjoy this. For those movie-goers expecting an array of jump scares from scary demons, you may not enjoy this. And finally, for those expecting a clear, fully explained story that offers many answers, you may not enjoy this. For although this film may not be any of these things, it is instead patient, complex, and one that I feel will stay in the viewers minds for quite some time.",Hereditary
1282,phillawrence-32142,Just not scary,5,3 August 2019,"This was like watching two different movies. I quite enjoyed the first half build up of suspense and the sense of dread it provided. Sadly however, the scares never came. I think the director wanted to pull off another KILL LIST ending, but where that worked, this ending most definitely did not. It came across as contrived and was just trying too hard. Plus it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Some fine performances, all wasted on this drivel.",Hereditary

1284,stargazerlily-49553,Pretentious Tripe....Waste of Collette and Byrne.,1,28 October 2018,"Could have been a really great modern update of a cult picture, aka ""Rosemary's Baby"". They had the acting chops with Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne. But the writing was plodding and there was no character development or exposition as to any reason that lay in any of the family members' actions. ( Other than Byrne , who was the only rock-like , stable, normal family member). No flashbacks that may have given us some idea as to Annie relationship with her mom, Ellen, in any part of their lifetime. Although, the writers and directors probably wanted that , to keep the audience off kilter, only relying on Annie's POW. The children were not only physically,but extremely emotionally and mentally unattractive . You felt absolutely no empathy for them. Especially, Charlie. The movie took way too long to tell it's story. It was not the least bit scary in a horror film genre but more sad as a family drama, that went wildly off the rails. Silly at the ending and could not hold a candle to its predecessors in the genre such as "" The Omen"" and "" Rosemary's Baby."" In the end, it reminded me of the ill-received Nicholas Cage movie, ""The Wicker Man"" . I felt stupid for investing time in such a silly movie.",Hereditary
1285,jones_p,Formulaic,1,14 March 2019,"Anyone familiar with Toni Colllette will know what a great actor she is - and she remains one in this movie. However she cannot save a staid formulaic story, banal even. Those who rave about this film are seeing something that just isn't there - maybe because they love the darkness of it. It is dark. But that's all it has. If you have even a slightly above average ability to grasp plot lines, nothing in this story will surprise you in my humble opinion. There is one surprising/shocking scene early on, but that's it. The ending, as has been commented on by others, is awful.",Hereditary

But Gabriel Byrne performance is really below compare to his conterpart.But the last 10 minutes just ruined the whole thing. I am under the impression that they were running out of time to shoot and did something just to wrap up and go home. Forgetting totally the rest of the movie.People found this movie scary...

Superb. The plot? Fantastic, Hereditary leaves you with lots to talk about after the film. As far as the ""horror"" part of things, I would say there are many scenes where horrific things happen which affect you and leave you shocked, and pull you into the movie and characters even more, but aren't necessarily ""scary"". I recommend this film to all. Horror fanatics, and even the average movie goer that thinks they don't like horror films. This is one that might just change your mind",Hereditary
1288,lucasacosta,Best horror film of the year (until now),8,27 October 2018,"In an instance of the history of cinema where the brilliance is less and less appreciated by the general public, is that Ari Aster presents us this dense family drama that involves a story of dark and insane horror. It's just that, the story of a family that is suffering throughout the film the most devastating misfortunes, and that converge in a horror beyond what they could have imagined. Hereditary addresses the issue of demonic possession and satanic cults at a higher artistic level, although unlike its counterparts, it presents a slow rhythm but full of anguish, pain and a very uninviting future that is anticipated. During a big part of the film, both the characters and us, the spectators, we will not know what is happening or what is going to happen, and it is partly this intrigue that keeps us all moving forward with the story despite what slow it may seem, the last act being the most intense, almost as if they saved everything for the end (even with some pretty horrid moments scattered throughout the film). And it is also that moment where everything explodes what makes this film worthwhile, because everything seen during the first and a half hour was for a purpose and everything has an answer. A horrible and brutal answer if you are able to connect with the movie correctly, or probably a disappointing end if, on the contrary, you expect another type of more conventional horror. Technically it is impeccable, it is in its history where for me it rises up to the best recent films of the genre, but it is the perfect mix of direction, cinematography, soundtrack and brilliant acting together with a magnificent script, which can even be considered of the best in terms of cinema in general that has given us the 2018. If you liked The VVitch and The Babadook or you're a fan of classical masterpieces like The Exorcist or The Rosemary's Baby, you'll surely find in Hereditary a work of the cinema of Horror that will please you. I reiterate, if your taste falls on more conventional genre films, decrease your hype a little and try to commit yourself to the story and maybe, you can enjoy some good movies and notice the quality of this film beyond whether it entertained you or not . Undoubtedly and despite the large number of mediocre horror films that are made in heaps, in the most recent years, some people has made exceptional and magnificent horror films that can even compete with the great classics of the genre. Hereditary is absolutelly one of them.",Hereditary
1289,sophie_b81,Deeply disturbing; not for the impatient,9,17 October 2018,"HEREDITARY, as demonstrated by mixed reviews, is not for all audiences. However, I found it to be one of the most deeply disturbing and unique horror movies I've ever seen. Few times has a movie left me feeling so unsettled and thinking about it days after viewing.I think what people don't like about the movie are the following choices made for the film: slow pacing, complicated mythology woven in between ""normal"" scenes, and a staggered layering of the film that devotes 70% family drama, 20% tragedy and terror, and 10% mythological horror. Also, some say it's ""artsy,"" which is true. But it's so much more than that. I really can't understand how some users claimed they laughed during HEREDITARY. Sure, there are some nonsense scenes near the end that are hard to interpret as anything other than bizzare. However, you have to be very desensitized or unsympathetic not to be disturbed by some of the tragic and terrifying moments the family in the film goes through. Just skip this movie if you don't have the patience for emotional drama, metephors, or self-interpretation. If you have an appreciation for unsettling horror that takes root slowly rather than through frequent jumpscares, watch HEREDITARY. If you're looking for a horror movie that goes outside the norm of the genre and flays it from the inside, watch HEREDITARY. If you sympathize with mental illness and the devastating impacts it may have on families, watch HEREDITARY.Side note: the acting is incredible. I will never forget Toni Collete's performance as Annie. She deserves so much praise.",Hereditary

I was awakened to an even more weird ending with Toni Collete's character hanging off the ceiling and the son being pronounced a prince of evil, or something like that.

I can appreciate the good production values and some great acting, especially Toni Collette who should get an Academy Award nom for her effort. In fact, her unraveling recalls Shelley Duvall's performance in ""The Shining"". And there was the unsettlingly weird look of newcomer Milly Shapiro who I thought was the little girl in ""Les Miserables"" but no. This film was more a study of the descent into madness/psychosis that was colored with horror. It wasn't a horror genre film like Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. But because it's a story about madness some of the scenes are difficult to understand and to determine if they're ""real"" or part of the character's madness. I'm a dude and not easily scared or intimidated so this film rather than scaring me was just more unsettling and disturbing, it left me in a bad mood, especially with the very odd, weird, again unsettling final scene. It was good for what it is, but I don't like what it is so I guess that rates a ""6"", very hard to rate.",Hereditary

1294,jaymcguinness,Ari Aster pens a fresh modern horror with his first movie and Toni Collette is terrifyingly good,8,7 January 2019,"Hereditary doesn't have many negatives at all. It is a refreshingly good horror in a genre that relies on too may of the same old jump-scares and basic plot devices.Written and Directed by Ari Aster, his first movie, Hereditary is a fantastic opener for the American. One of the main takeaways for a horror is to leave the viewer talking about and remembering the scares. Hereditary certainly achieves that. The plot feels different, certainly in how it builds and some of the scenes are certainly memorable. I am looking forward to Aster's second movie Midsommar later this year featuring the excellent Will Poulter.Speaking of the cast, Toni Collette is simply outstanding in this movie. So much so, that she is in for Oscar contention. Her expressions in many scenes are simply terrifying on their own. The great thing about this movie is that this performance doesn't even need to carry the movie, the supporting cast is also good. Alex Wolff as the son, is also outstanding and he is involved in all of the major and scary scenes in the movie. Milly Shapiro plays a character that is particularly well written and she pulls off the creepy sibling with ease. Gabriel Byrne who plays the most sane character in the movie also is his typically solid self.I need to mention the cinematography also, some of the scenes are really well shot. The house in particular, which reminded me of some of the hotel rooms and lobby in The Shining, was a very good choice. The open plan living area just added to the tension in one major scene with Collette, Byrne and the fire.Overall, this is a very enjoyable watch for any horror fan and Ari Aster is definitely one to watch as a writer and director in this genre. 8/10",Hereditary

Neither of us enjoy gory movies.Well, I had no idea what the movie was about and figured it may actually be about real hereditary health issues. 20 minutes in and I figured it was an informative film about mental health problems. 40 minutes in and I was very confused. 60 minutes in and I wanted to leave. We stuck it out to the end and all 8 of the people in the theater stood up collectively. Two of the people seemed to have known what this movie was going to be and walked out of the theater calmly. The remaining 6 people (myself included) stood there and all said at the same time, ""What the hell was that?"". I could try to explain it but other reviews likely already do that. This is not a movie you could walk in cold and obtain value from it. I'm not sure if people who specifically search out horror movies could either but parts of it certainly do create some sorrow before you start getting confused again. Jeepers Creepers (2001) would be a much better movie for the unsuspecting audience.

1305,vchung-05758,"An excellent ""slow-burn"" horror film focused on grief and family.",9,21 January 2021,"Hereditary is a horror film directed by Ari Aster, starring Toni Collette as Annie Graham, Gabriel Byrne as her husband Steve Graham, Alex Wolff as son Peter, and Milly Shapiro as daughter Charlie. It centers on a family that suffers from a horrible tragedy and begins to fall apart, all the while sinister secrets are dug up. Much like The Witch, the film is more of a slow-burn horror in terms of pacing. Unlike The Witch, the film is set in the modern day.Firstly, the acting. Toni Collette's acting as Annie, mother of two and whose own mother had recently died, is beyond excellent, with certain scenes in particular allowing her to show a wide range of emotions and deliver a genuine performance, at times unsettling, at times heart-wrenching, but 100% real and believable. Gabriel Byrne, as well-meaning father Steve, serves as the most grounded center for the film, the middleman in the familial conflict between Annie and Peter. Alex Wolff's Peter is a 16-year-old with a lot of emotional baggage, much like his mother. He can come across as a little immature and irresponsible at times, but Wolff infuses the performance with an innocence, constantly wide-eyed with fear or upset, that you can't help but feel very sorry for him. Milly Shapiro's Charlie is honestly one of the best ""creepy child"" performances in recent memory, moving with a somewhat ominous yet innocuously slow pace, and always doing a strange clicking noise with her tongue. The clicking was so effective that I have an instinctive shivering reaction every time I heard it. An acting highlight in the film is the scene where Annie and Peter suddenly start arguing at the dinner table, probably one of the best scenes ever put to film, with the argument progressing realistically and the dialogue flowing very naturally much like how a real argument would be between two people struggling to come to terms with grief and loss.Secondly, the plot. To say that the plot goes into some wildly unexpected territory would be a huge understatement. At its core, the story is about how the family slowly unravels in the face of a tragic loss, while also uncovering certain secrets about the family. This is done gradually, with Annie telling a support group how her mother was controlling and manipulative, and how she forced Annie to let her take care of Charlie. Tensions between Peter and Annie also begin to build up. The plot takes a wild turn about 30 minutes in, leaving audiences reeling and unsure of how the film will proceed. It is a great way to throw the audience for a loop and leaving them shocked. The event also begins a gradual build-up of dread that does not let up throughout the entire runtime of the film, gradually heightened through disturbing imagery and the reveal of shocking truths about Annie and her family's history. It is not without reason that Hereditary has been dubbed ""one of the scariest films since The Exorcist"".Hereditary is a tightly-plotted ""slow-burn"" horror film with excellent performances, particularly from Toni Collette and Alex Wolff, focusing on the aftermath of a great loss in a family, relying more on horrific imagery and escalating tension than jump scares, and with plenty of unexpected twists. Definitely among the scariest and most well-made horror films of the last decade.Score: 9/10",Hereditary

But neither of those things are enough to rescue a script that, by the end, degenerates into predictable banality. We've seen this plot before. Rosemary's Baby immediately comes to mind.

1314,mbyrne_1664,Immensely Disappointed,5,23 August 2018,This film started out with so much potential and delivered on numerous things like being creepy and unnerving. It was far too long though and about half way through you could tell there was not going to be any sort of happy ending for this family. The film got darker and darker to the point were you knew nobody was going to even end up alive at the end. The ending well it was quite simply weird. There were some genuinely creepy and frightening moments in the film but not enough to gloss over the storyline they stretched over 2 hours. Some good acting but a weak script.,Hereditary
1315,joejohn-821-884251,Definitely scary and tense... but a good movie???,5,9 January 2019,"Basically what it comes down to is maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this movie to be very difficult to follow and ultimately I felt that it demanded too much from the audience in order to piece together what was REALLY happening in the movie during the first screening of the film.The manipulation by the director and production crew is excellent however, if not a little cheesy and cliche at times. The movie succeeds in being very tense and even pretty scary at points. When watching this I felt a palpable dread during most of the movie, but a lot of that dread was fear and anxiety about what sort or horrific gore the movie might show on the screen. IMO THAT kind of horror is not the right way to do horror and not very skillful.Anyways, I felt like the movie had a lot going for itself thematically, the acting in this movie is surprisingly good as well, but ultimately it was just too difficult for me to put together what actually transpired in the movie after my first viewing. And I feel that a movie that leaves people confused when leaving the theater isn't necessarily a good thing.Not sure if I would watch this again at this point.",Hereditary

I was deceived by the good reviews and the decent trailer It started off pretty well, first few scenes were great, had good expectations. After that it was a snooze fest for more than an hour. Comparing it with ""The Shining"", "" The Omen"" and ""Exorcist"" among others is utterly laughable. Great horror movies make you care about the characters, this is where the horror lies. In this movie I did not really care for a single person. The father was meek and weak. Anne was a complete psycho from the start, Peter was underdeveloped, the little brat was the worst. I kept expecting the ending to salvage some of the merits of the movie, but it was actually even more ridiculous and nonsensical. This was badly written, badly edited, badly presented. People weren't scared, they were bored and left dissapointed. The only decent horror I've seen so far this year is ""A Silent Place"". Don't waste your money on this mediocre piece.",Hereditary

This is one of those movies. The despair and desperation of these characters in a game they don't want to be involved in but can't get out of is so difficult and heartbreaking to watch. Everything unravels slowly and that might be hard for some people who expect constant action from movies. This movie dwells in feeling more than action for most of its runtime and when something happens it has weight. Some scenes punch you so hard in the gut they leave you breathless.I found myself smiling sometimes after the initial shock of visceral horror, because few horror movies can manage to do that. I love this movie. I love Toni Collette, not only in the legendary dinner scene, but throughout the movie she just IS that character. It's amazing. She's amazing.I love this.

I'm sorry, Yalitza (I loved you in Roma), but this is the woman who should've been nominated and should've won the Oscar for best actress this year.
-The ending still feels like a whole different film to me. Even though you get all the signs leading to it. It was mishandled, a bummer after such a PERFECT and POWERFUL first hour and a half.
-What a beautiful film about sorrow. I was far more invested on that than I was at the ending.
-Some of the most shocking images to be put on film these days.
-If you're not into slowburns, this is not for you.
-It feels very similar to The VVitch and I'm glad there's people taking horror to such a brilliant level of elegance.
-It's more of family drama than a scare fest.

1330,markmurphy561,"Relatively familiar horror territory, done RIGHT.",8,21 July 2019,"I'm generally affected by horror movies only while watching them but this one did stay with me after leaving the cinema.
On the surface it's a more or less standard horror movie story: a family is terrorized by demonic activity. I felt that the horror came from two different avenues in this film. There's the family drama which revolves around Toni Collette's barely-controlled resentment for her children and there's the demonic cult which her mother belonged to.
One of the greatest things the film does is force you in to place of immense discomfort pretty early on in the runtime leaving you vulnerable to the events that happen after. I thought that was a genius move!
My one problem with the film is that it fails to actually join the two story strands in the end. The last act of the film leaves behind the family drama and focuses on the cult without resolving the family or interweaving it into the cult story.
It sounds like a bigger problem than it is because the skill gone in to producing the actual horror and scares in the film MORE than makes up for the lack of tie-in at the end.",Hereditary

1334,bnitcamela,"Overhyped, Overlong, Underachieving, Underhanded Nonsense",5,10 June 2018,"This film is not credible, not scary, and not recommended unless you're bored and streaming it at home. Do not waste your money or risk an accident where you or a family member might be decapitated while traveling to or from a theater. Seriously though, this is a clear case of the hype machine being cynically manipulated to drive box office performance but an utterly forgettable movie. Stay with me here - I know I haven't even made a single specific complaint about the film, and I will - but Ari Aster can't seem to resist these endings that even MNS might be ashamed of. It kind of worked with ""The VVitch"" in 2015, but this time it's just too-much-nonsense-icing on top of an already unbelievable cake that failed to rise. OK enough of the metaphors. The positives: This film is very nicely shot. The lighting is perfect and for about 15 minutes the director does a good job of ratcheting up a somewhat believable tension. The cinematography is great. The acting is just OK in the aggregate - Collette is very good, but I don't even see why Gabriel Byrne signed up for this. The kids have the difficult job of making otherwise ridiculous and totally unbelievable scenarios and behaviors seem as though they might be possible. Now to the negatives (SPOILERS AHEAD): 
People simply do not behave in the ways that are depicted in this movie. You don't send a 10 year old (I know she was 13 or 14 during filming, but she doesn't look it at all) to a high school party with a senior. A high school senior who plans on smoking some dube doesn't take his 10 year old sister along at his mom's bizarre request without an argument. Further, you don't do that - even if you're grieving-but-not-grieving over your recently departed mother - when the girl suffers from a severe nut allergy and you don't do it without sending an Epi Pen along with your son. People who just decapitated their sibling in an auto accident don't simply drive home, go to bed, and leave a human head on the ground (much less your own sister's) then wait for their parents to discover the headless body in one of the family's two Volvos the next morning - presumably after bleeding out in the back seat. Additionally, when this kind of thing happens, the cops tend to get involved, amirite? In this movie, however, that's exactly what happens and no police, no cleanup and they're driving the car in the very next scene. Hmmm...When your son, who has weeks or days earlier killed your daughter, resumes going to school almost immediately, without therapy or counseling, has a seizure and bashes his own face in on the desk, you don't load his lifeless body into the same Volvo, drive him home, and deposit him into his bed - still unconscious - without any kind of medical consultation or observation at all. Laughably ridiculous. The reaction of the family to the mother's dalliances into the world of seances and such is just not believable. I don't know how else to say it. And the problem with all of the above is that what little plot there is absolutely requires the audience to suspend disbelief in the very essence of human nature and behavior and accept without any question that these kinds of things are likely or possible.In addition, the whole convoluted idea is just ridiculous and unnecessary. So the evil, manipulative matriarch wanted to get a suitable male host for her demon lover, but in the process screws up several attempts over a generation, and puts him into a little girl's body instead - meaning that she has to be killed and then he can possess the boy. OMG..SMH...WOWFinally there's the underlying conceit to the way the whole picture was made. When you have to rely on an unnerving soundtrack to create a mood in a movie like this, you're not doing it right. In any case, it didn't work. At no point was anyone in the audience frightened or unnerved and I heard several laughs and scoffs during moments that apparently were supposed to be scary or meaningful. I suppose I should have seen this sophistry coming when, prior to the movie, the theater showed an interview with the director who made the ridiculous claim that he views ""The Shining"" as a comedy movie - and that's it's more effective as such than it is a horror movie. The guy is clearly delusional and making movies only for himself and his industry/film school buddies. Avoid. I'm not kidding - wait for it to hit Netflix.

The acts were amazing and there was silence in their house ever since Charlie died which explains the grief on losing her, especially Annie because she wanted to speak to her child so badly and use the 'am-i-speaking-to-you' way.My favorite scene was when three of them trying to call Charlie in their living room, it was the scariest part for me because how both Steve and Peter showed how they were really scared was AMAZING.

1339,dingane,On my top 20 horror movies of all time list.,10,10 June 2018,"This is not a monsters jumping out of darkness going ""boo"" type of horror movie. Don't come into this thinking it's a sensationalist monster-makeup horror movie or a jump-scare horror movie. It's so much more than that. Two things make this movie fantastic. First, it's a meditation on anguish so real and believable that it's really hard to take at times. Toni Collette delivers a scene of overwhelming pain and anguish that could win her an Oscar. So much pain that, to borrow from Col. Walter E. Kurtz, ""I wanted to rip my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do."" It's just a damned good movie about loss and pain, to say nothing of it being a truly creepy horror story. Second, the pacing is phenomenal. It's a slow burn at first, in which the creep-factor slowly builds. By the time you reach the climax...I don't know, I'll just say that my jaw literally dropped open once the climax started.I'm a horror junkie. I love all kinds of horror movies from comedy-horror like Cabin in the Woods to paranoid horror like John Carpenter's The Thing to out-and-out silly horror like Dead Alive to drama horror like Rosemary's Baby. This is something more like Rosemary's Baby. Rosemary's Baby was fantastic not just because it was about a woman giving birth to the anti-Christ, but because it was a claustrophobic vision of the social powerlessness of being a woman in 1960s America. This is like that. It's going to be a horror classic for sure. I can't decide where it fits in my list of all-time favorite horror movies, but it's top 20 at least.It's also a movie you need to see twice. Honestly, though, I'm going to have to give it a minute before I see it again. It's pretty rough (in a good way).",Hereditary

It lacks the artistry and subtle suspense of the aforementioned masterpiece. And it's a really slow (and I'm not kidding), slow burner. Could do with some editing. 
What stands out is Tony Colette's acting. The inevitability of her character's family's fate is heartbreaking and she depicts that perfectly.
The movie plays pretty well with our perceptionnof what's going on: is it a mental problem, is it family drama, is it witchcraft, is it a nightmare? Don't worry, the answer will be brutally shoved down your throat in the grand finale, just in case you didn't get it?

I was on the edge my seat through pretty much this whole film, I was really into what was going on in the whole atmosphere of the movie, and was really interested in what would happen next. It definitely does a good job of getting you hooked into the plot and it makes it very hard for you to even leave the room for something such as using the restroom! I really wasn't expecting Charlie to die near the beginning of the film, I seriously could barely guess what was going to happen, especially to each character.The Bad:One thing about this film, was that the ending was definitely unexpected, in a bad way. It definitely could've been better, but at the same time, it also could've been worse. I kind of felt that I had wasted all of that 2 hours of getting gripped to the storyline on a disappointing ending, but I definitely don't hate the entire film for it. The ending wasn't good, but it wasn't terrible either (not exactly what my family thinks though), which is why I gave the film the rating that I did, becsuse the ending could've been much worse.I honestly don't know whether or not I should suggest this film, but I can say that you should look into it first before watching it so you don't get completely disappointed.

You can't unsee some of these scenes & they will stick with you, I promise. I watched Hereditary the first time alone in a totally dark room with a 100"" screen & 11 speakers at 2am & about 75 min into the movie I actually turned it off because I was legitimately too scared to continue. I'm 40 yrs old. It was too scary for me to keep watching. Let that sink in. Only movie I ever turned off midway out of fear. I know everyone has different tastes, but why this movie isn't lauded like The Shining or The Exorcist or (fill in the blank with any widely beloved horror movie), I don't understand. Maybe it just hasn't had enough time to be fully appreciated yet. I don't know, but in my opinion, it's brilliant. The mother & son are so good together that their acting actually makes me very anxious. It's believably uncomfortable, unnerving, & real. Toni Collette should not only have won an Oscar for best actress, she makes people like Heath Ledger & Jaoquin Phoenix look like borderline amateurs at acting crazy. No disrespect to those guys for their takes on the Joker, but Collette is freakin genius in her ability to go from stoic to insane in under 5 sec. She's the Ferrari of mentally unstable!

The trailers marketed this as something to redefine horror, however, this film is incredibly unique, and you shouldn't compare it to others.Some of the dialogue was straight up bad. To quote some of the lines, there is; ""Wipe that face off your face."" and ""What language is even that."" It thrusted me out of the film entirely. The ending felt slightly disappointing, but that's just my opinion, but apart from that I have nothing bad to say.The best thing about this film is the acting. It's superb, Gabriel Byrne was good, although his character the most underwritten, Alex Wolff was great and the way he expressed true terror is unforgettable, Milly Shapiro had a golden film debut as she absolutely owns the role of the creepy child, and ofcourse Toni Collette stole the show. Depending on what other films come out this year, I could definitely imagine her getting an Oscar nomination for this role.The Camera work is flashy, yet subtle. It is absolutely brilliant. Hereditary wouldn't be half the film it is without Pawel Pogorzelski's jaw dropping cinematography. Once again, I would not be surprised to see this get nominated. The story was good, it incorporated super realistic topics like Family Drama and grief with the more supernatural topics like Ghosts and Spirits. The set design I think is really underappreciated. Most horror movies have big scary dirty houses, but as you can tell from any trailer, this big house is modern and a first in horror movies for me.Overall, you need to at least watch this film.

My girlfriend invited me to join her to watch Hereditary this evening. 
I was excited, as I love me a good horror. But that is where my excitement ended. 
I watched it all the way through, however my partner nodded off about 45 minutes in. 
I think I kept watching because due the cast and their fantastic acting, I guess I was expecting something great to emerge from the slow burn story telling. 
The film has a certain air to it, the lighting, the musical score and the cinematography kept me on edge most of the time, other times I was a tad bored and got to ""fidgeting"". At one point I considered stopping the stream, waking my partner and taking her to bed, but then something happened that made me stay. 
This movie had so much potential, but it seemed to get stuck in the drama genre for the majority of the time. It isn't until the final 20 minutes or so that the film adopts a rather haphazard and seemingly rushed horror/thriller feel and then it ends, leaving a void of unanswered questions. 
As a massive fan of the horror genre, I can't say I felt horrified by Hereditary.

It's somewhere of a cross between a gut wretching family drama and a slow burning horror. It takes its time throughout taking you on a slow ride as you watch this family go through a series of horrid events and dig an equally horrid past, all the while tension between everyone slowly building up. Nobody is at rest, nobody is safe. The casting of this movie was spot on and the part of the unhinged mother and estranged family creates the perfect distancing give us the discomfort that everyone is together yet alone. The camera work did an astounding job of creating a fresh, tense kind of horror that was never put to rest with a jump scare and as a viewer you're never at ease, even after learning not to expect sudden scares. Towards the end the tension erupts and kind of transforms into full-on horror and leads us to a shock ending that ties the movie under a bow and brings together a number of clever hints and foreshadowings, the mood also totally shifts. As a movie I found this one very complex with the mix between drama and the total mood shift towards the ending, not to say it didn't pay off. I think Hereditary is just of the border of mainstream leading towards niche, and it tell anyone to give it a try.",Hereditary

The music was a little creepy, but other than that, it was just lame. Obviously, the only reason this director makes movies for is to show nudity at the end. I don't know what his obsession is with showing naked people. However, the nudity at the end of this one was nothing to gawk at. Nothing exciting. I'm persuaded to think he must be Mormon. Apparently, they're just as bad at making satanic possession flicks as they are at writing vampire novels. The only people scared by this movie must be crazy church ladies.

You know nothing can or will be the same for them as you fear for your own sense of normality. Few films are brave enough to put front and center our darkest and most powerful fears and anxieties, and portray themes of grief and disintegration, in such an honest and unflinching manner as this one.

1372,imaginary-life,False Advertisement,3,19 February 2019,"I have hesitated to watch this until it was rentable. the hype from Sundance and reviewers putting it in their Top Ten Horror Films Of All Time! intrigued me long enough that I made sure not to read any spoiler reviews until I had a chance to see it without knowing too much other than what the trailer shows. The trailer is serious false advertisement though as it shows all the disturbing effects scenes all in one short ad like a greatest hits reel. So here I am for the first time in awhile since shredding the ridiculously hyped Black Swan years ago. One reviewer points out what I also assumed this film was about. A satanic cult story like in the 70s. He describes exactly what the ending was about, but somehow even this doesn't improve the film""s standing at all. I feel it somewhat weakens it in fact. Look up the review that mentions the demon Paimon.
I like Toni Collette, but she did a much better job at being a terrified mother in Krampus, and that film may have been more a silly fun horror, but was in fact more frightening than this drama here. I really wanted to enjoy this with all my might, but as the scenes shown in the trailer unfolded once aver 20 minutes it all seemed out of context with the story that was eventually being told here. There is one shocking scene in which a character you thought was important to the dramaturgy indeed ends up dying. However the aftermath of that revelation is completely lacking in explanation and leads only to disinterest in the eventual outcome. I wouldn't give it a zero as it is well filmed, and manages to build a certain level of dread throughout the first half. Of course it is also vague enough that you can make up your own explanation about what it all means by the end, and I applaud that effort. Unfortunately I didn't care to even pursue any further analysis at the conclusion other than wondering what the filmmakers thought they were doing. There is a similarity to the equally hyped and slow moving The Witch, but I feel that that film actually has a perfect ending, and holds the sense of dread consistently from beginning to end. Like Hereditary it also had many of the scare highlights in the trailer but the payoff of seeing those scenes in the movie was much more consistent
within the context, and the overall story being told, instead of being greatest hits, they were just ingredients.Sorry, this was long winded, and there's enough reviews on here, but I figure one more opinion from a film fan who loves suspenseful and supernatural horror could't hurt. In the end we are always hoping for more surprises to come in this genre and I appreciate newcomers giving this style of filmmaking new life.

1379,kadenschwertner,the most disturbing portrayal of evil ever crafted.,9,27 October 2021,"Horror is my favorite genre. I didn't like films like the conjuring, insidious, saw, etc. Popcorn horror, if you will. Films that you watch with friends, they make you jump, laugh, and overall you have a fun experience with. But they didn't scare me. They didn't interest me. They weren't unique, original, or effective at leaving an impression on me. I'm not saying it's not okay to enjoy those films, I'm just saying that I didn't enjoy them. They were predictable, they made me laugh, and they never left me with anything to think about. That is what I look for in film. That is what film is supposed to be. In modern-day times, too many films are just pumped out as cash-grab, general audience comfort food. This is why people didn't like this film.In a time period where people's definition of horror is something that makes you jump, startles you; and you take that expectation of a horror film and apply it to Hereditary, The VVitch, Midsommar, etc. You will be disappointed. This movie is far above jump scares. This film is ""scary"" in the way that most films wouldn't dare to be scary. This movie is scary in the way that it exploits real human experiences and shows you what family can do to you. That you don't have any control in your life. You might always be manipulated, blamed, and tricked without you even having the slightest idea of what is going on. This is what Hereditary is.Why people don't like it:
-No jump scares, doesn't fit their definition of horror in the way they want it to.-""Nothing Happens"" This is the kind of thing that immature people who don't have empathy for human emotions will say.-It left them feeling sick/bad. This film is not fun to watch, it doesn't make you feel good in the way that the conjuring makes you feel good. People will easily mistake feeling disturbed as a sign that the movie was bad.My Opinion:
9/10
This film ruined me. This is the only film that has brought me to a sweat since The Shining. The music, cinematography, acting, editing; created an extremely unsettling tone throughout, I was never relaxed, I was never comfortable. How could anyone be comfortable watching a family fall apart at the hands of a Satanic Cult? This movie pushed me to my limit. Similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, the story is continuously changing, remaining unpredictable all throughout. Both Ari and Alfred killed their main characters early on in their films, causing the story to take a dark turn. This is really a hit or miss, it either breaks you, or just isn't your thing.

The plot develops slowly, but ends abruptly. If you havent heard the demon's name before or don't know the backstory, you wouldn't understand what happened at the end. I'd suggest you to read the trivia section. 
There are no SCARY scenes that'll make jump. Just one, if I can be generous but that's before the climax.
The film tries to build anticipation very slowly with eerie music, and it works in some scenes. There is a twist, 2 in fact, but are not explained.
So, here is the movie plot ( i think)

Ellen somehow makes her granddaughter Charlie possesed by the demon before she died. But Paimon requires a male body, Peter in fact.

If you are watching this for jump scares, slasher horror or something to have on in the background this is not the movie for you. You definitely won't like it.There's tons of reviews on here so I won't really go much into it besides saying the acting was amazing. The content of this movie is super heavy since there is a lot of death and grief. There's also talk on the pressure of having children even though main character didn't want to (which she tells her child). So emotionally you get really messed up and you feel for the whole family and see where they are coming from even though you don't agree with them all the time. There are clues from almost the first moment the movie gets started so the ending doesn't come out of nowhere but its definitely has its surprises.I have to say the relationship between the mother and children just really got to me. Especially towards the end. The tension building up between the family and the constant uneasiness you feel (but you really don't understand why) really comes together in the end and freaks you out.Definitely would recommend this but I think only a certain type of person would like this kind of movie.",Hereditary

1389,erimerdi,The Exorcist is far way better...,3,30 December 2018,"When I saw ""this generation's exorcist"" on the poster of this movie I had to watch it. When judged by today's standards ""The Exorcist"" is still a good solid horror movie but when it came out back in 1973 it was something else, terrifying to death and put a new standard for horror genre and rightfully earned ""the scariest movie of all time"" title. I think many horror movie fans would agree with my comment. Naturally I was expecting a horror movie in ""the Exorcist"" magnitude but sadly after watching Hereditary the ""this generation's exorcist"" claim is nothing but a balloon and a disgrace to what ""The Exorcist"" accomplished almost 50 years ago!
Hereditary holds a solid drama character and I think it is a great drama movie than a horror movie. The acting, places, lights, ambiance, cinematography are great. It can reflect the sorrow of the main character's to the audience caused by the dramatic events. Sadly when the horror elements begin the movie quickly turn into a joke. Nothing is solid and consistent and it simply jumps all around different subjects of scary elements such as ghosts, cults, witchcraft, occult and you can't tell what everything is all about or what's going on. This is not a bad thing in most movies as it keeps the audience but Hereditary tends to loose most of them very quickly and even bore the audience with many inconsistent events.
The end of the movie is even a bigger joke! I wish they kept it as a good drama movie and had not touched the elements of horror ar all. I give just 3 stars because of the first half of the movie and all the good qualities I mentioned above however as a horror movie it doesn't deserve even 1 star!",Hereditary

1395,nigel-431-811649,Hereditary is perhaps the Exorcist for a new generation. Intelligent and pervasive!,10,21 June 2018,"Hereditary does not rely on gimmick horror. Instead it borders an the uncomfortable treading of a high tension piano wire, tightening as it is to breaking point. It starts slowly, almost dragging, but not quite due to the engaging encounters of the principal cast. It is not a gratuitous essay in jump scares, or saturated with traditional horror cues and yet seems familiar.
The familiarity comes from the disturbing elevation, of at times subliminal soundtrack that crescendos and releases just prior to scathing events that are truly harrowing.
The story line is both seemingly benign and innocuous at first but progresses to uncomfortable and eventual tortuous. 
No spoilers because the film draws you in several directions and twists initial perceptions onto their heads as you journey with the claustrophobic assault.
Its not perfect by any means but it is sinister and harrowing and ensures you are squirming.
I found IT, the much celebrated horror remake to be tame and funny, I enjoyed the tension of GET OUT but thought it lacked a true psychological edge, but Hereditary truly was a celebration of ALL things good with well crafted horror.

This film did not disappoint and in fact was the better of the two. It had its own shocking visuals and creepy characters yet it was its sheer relentlessness that was most impressive. With scene after scene of horror filled suspense you never have a moment to catch your breath. Great acting, directing and writing, definitely one the best horror films I've ever seen. I was half expecting an hour of close up shots of the strange looking girl's face as they could have quite easily got by on this alone to leave me feeling rather uneasy but in the end she was barely used in this way at all. The majority of the fear was from the creative disturbing imagery, as in midsommar and although the plot is a tad squiffier in hereditary you are still able to just about buy it and are left satisfied that your girlish screams throughout were not unfounded. Very much looking forward to his Ari's next fear fest after this one, leading the field in this genre at the moment. 8.7/10",Hereditary

I wouldn't say I was completely satisfied (this is not an Exorcist), but it's the closest it could get in a very long time, I think. The movie starts like a normal drama and builds suspense for a long time, not neglecting to release the tension intermittently, but the last half an hour or so is like a roller-coaster.

My mother was depressed 24/7 and the feeling of guilt still haunts me to this day. There were parties and family photos looking happy, but underneath that façade, a dark memory lingers. I was never comfortable around my parents. I was always apologetic or trying to please them.I find the first two acts did what it should. Set the mood right with visual cues that will be useful on the third act. There are some scenes that I find unsettling. The scene with Charlie and her brother driving to the ER for instance, did it happen or was he tripping? Cut to Annie crying hysterically. Masterful editing.The third act is when events got odd.

Many people reviewing this movie seem to feel that it is slow and more of a drama rather than a horror movie. I do not agree. What Hereditary does very well is to capture true depression in relation to loss of someone close. The loss of the will to live and the constant feel of panic.And as the movie turns towards the dark and occult I must say that it is rare that a movie can even do so without appear childish and ridiculous. However, even here, Hereditary succeeds very well. I find this movie sharp and spot on straight through - and the darkness it has is unlike anything I have ever seen before.Then also, the acting of Alex Wolff and Toni Collette is nothing but outstanding. This could possibly be the best horror movie I have ever seen. Where all other horror movies are obvious and all about throwing something in your face, so that you will jump by sudden fear - Hereditary plays with darkness and fear on a completely different level.I am saddened that so many people doesnt seem to understand this movie, because it's not like other ""horror flicks"".

1417,dyonisus,"immensly uncomfortable, but also cluttered.",8,20 September 2020,"Ari Aster produces a gripping and uncomfortable film - if you loved Midsommar, you will enjoy this movie a lot, too. And vice versa.
The production design is superb and the lovely and naturalistic home of the family slowly turns into an iery place of terror. The viewer is left unsure about what is real and what is the result of mental illness - or perhaps darker forces at work. The only issue with the film is that Ari Aster pays so much attention to detail that the average viewer can't keep up. There are tons of subtle hints, some plain as day and some so hidden you'd have to rewatch the movie three times to pick it up. This, while when rewatchint the movie certainly very entertaining, left me constantly wondering whats important and whats not, constantly looking for reocurring motifs only for them to play a minor role and leaving me a bit clueless at the end. The ending could have been done better, while Ari Aster tries his best to use different cinematic elements to portray the powers at work, it is easy to lose track of who is what and what is who.
All in all, if you 'click' and manage to follow the ending, its an amazing experience of a film, gripping and certainly worth a rewatch.
The performances are really all great and very captivating - coupled with the amazing production design and Ari Aster's genius storytelling this allows for one of the most immersive movies of the year.

The acting was great as was the slowly mounting tension of the film.
This was a refreshing change to other movies in this genre. Reminds me of Rosemarys baby and The Shining, in the way the tension builds and the main character (Toni Colette) seems convinced that she is making a positive contact with her dead child but is infact unwittingly taking part in a satanist ritual (her dead mother was also a satanist, but she doesn't realise for the first part of the film).
This film was highly original and genuinely moving, as you could empathise with the main character especially in the first part of the film.
The ending was quite obvious what was happening and reviewers saying ""WTF happened there"" clearly didn't understand/appreciate the film.
Overall I found this film highly entertaining and well worth watching, one you'll remember.

The climax is quite well made and unnerving, but there aren't really any deeper themes or character analysis going on here. It really is just a stupid horror movie, but an incredibly pretentious one - the first half having literally nothing going on but mundane setup is completely unjustified because literally NOTHING is happening. I usually dislike this criticism because in most contexts it is falsely used, as in most movies people use that critique for are actually developing themes or studying characters. However, here it is entirely pointless. No deeper meaning, the characters are all one dimensional - though the lead actress does a good job. This movie being compared to others like the witch or it comes at night is utterly laughable, because those movies - while also slow - actually developed themes and analyzed characters. The slower moments also contributed to the general atmosphere of unease. Here, it's just an absolute stupid waste of time. There's little separating this movie from more ""mainstream"" ones like the conjuring besides the snobby ""oh, we are so artful that we are above jump scares. Also, long stretches of nothing happening!"" Could not have missed the point more. In films like it comes at night, those stretches were used in a meaningful way. Here it is just stupid.Kind of predictable, saw the twist coming, kind of dumb and very pretentious because yes this is a shallow movie. There was absolutely no need for the stretches of nothing or to act as if this is some higher form of art. Had it not been for the good climax, I would definitely have rated lower.",Hereditary
1423,Poshlust,Needlessly slow - it's just a stupid horror movie,6,23 October 2019,"The film is well shot. The climax is well made and unnerving. However, the movie wastes your time with the beginning half in which nothing happens. This criticism is unfortunately often misused in films where little action takes place to establish and deepen themes, or analyze characters. However, this movie is not intelligent or creative enough to make use of these periods of slow pacing. It does not contribute to any themes, it does not develop characters - the movie really just starts and ends with the concept of ""don't stick your in crazy"". Being slow paced and lacking jump scares is not substance in itself.Comparing this movie to other slower A24 titles like ""It Comes At Night"", or ""The Witch"" is incredibly misleading because while those movies were also slow paced, they used that downtime to flesh out themes, to build the tension, and to analyze characters and their motivations. ""Hereditary"" does none of these things - it just wastes your time in an incredibly stupid manner because I feel as if this movie assumes its viewers are stupid and can't tell the difference anyway. It is incredibly insulting to have someone compare stretches of stupid indulgent trash with more thought out works.However, I am rating this movie a 6/10 because the climax was well done and unnerving, it's just not particularly subtle or intelligent. The ending was obvious, I saw the twist coming from a mile away. In the end, it's just an okay horror movie brought down by immense pretention with lack of talent to back it up.",Hereditary

First off, this movie is a little over two hours-which I normally wouldn't mind, but I felt every single minute of that two hours. This movie felt like it dragged on for 5 hours.
One thing I will say, I thought Toni Collette played her role very well but even she couldn't carry this. The storyline is absurd and confusing, even for a horror movie. I've never been one to really be confused when a movie ends but me and my friends all were tryng to figure out what was going on after the credits rolled.
I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but the ending where they were kneeling was so stupid I couldn't believe they actually had that in the movie. If you're going to do gore, do it right. It just looked ridiculously fake.
Lastly, this movie is boring. Now I'm not opposed to slow horror movies-they're some of the best in my opinion but the build up has to be worth it. As I mentioned, the ending is ridiculous to the point of almost being funny so it definitely wasn't worth any of the boring parts.

I rated the movie with 1 star and it is for the cast.
I mean the acting was okay, but the storyline was a bit confusing and very slow at the beginning and did not get any better at the end.
At first I thought, this one is with ghosts and scary scenes but at the end it was with with some naked sick people in a secret sect, which didn't make any sense at the beginning.
The first thing I look up, before watching the movies, is how many stars it has and the trailer. If the trailer looks good, I usually don't watch it till the end, to make it more interesting. So I was very displeased and I didn't like the movie at all.
The beginning was extremely boring, and I had to fight with my thoughts, if I should leave the theater or should I keep watching. I did keep watching, because I already paid for it....
I've spent most of my teen years watching movies, so I allow myself to think that I know a bit about movies. Maybe not a lot, but a bit.. :) And I don't understand, how people can rate this one with 10 stars... HOW? 
I get it, it's a movie with a sick grandma, who was in a sect and had to sacrifice her family members, so that the KING inside her can go inside her grandson.. eemm okaaay. But why kill the girl.. So that the boy can be damaged and weak?? For what? And somehow the movie turned to be like an exorcism, and who was inside the mom and why didn't they dig the little girls body up.. I mean they could have use it as well...

One of my favorite movies is Stalker so believe me I know ""slow"" movies have just as much potential to be good as any other movie so inb4 someone tries to say i have no patience. Well I guess if somebody accused me of that they would be right because I don't have patience... for bad movies!",Hereditary

1442,frommunichwithlove,Brilliant!,9,26 June 2018,"Let me start by saying that I'm a 45 year old horror movie buff from Germany who has a hard time with many of the newer genre movie fare. Most of them rely to much on ""jumps scares"" every 5 minutes, in order to keep their audience awake. They might indeed make you jump for a second, but the horror rarely has a lasting effect. It doesn't ""creep into your mind"" as good horror is supposed to do. Personally, I'm much into 70s horror, such as Rosemarys Baby, The Excorcist, Suspiria etc. Those are movies that gave me the creeps the first time I saw them, and they still do. Some of the more recent movies I would place in that category have been The Witch and Sinister, as well as many of the movies of Mike Flanagan (Oculus,Absentia etc) - a great young talent in genre filmmaking. And now Hereditary , a movie you have to love if you're into real, ""serious"" adult horror instead of all the ""Kiddie-Stuff"" they produce nowadays. The atmosphere is mesmerizing from the first scene on, and it creates an increasingly dreamlike atmosphere and a growing feeling of dread that doesn't come with cheap scares. Still it is not an ""art film"" in the sense of being ""style over substance"". The story is not new, but told very well and it is quite reminiscent of some of the 70s stuff I've mentioned. And - also quite rare - has an excellent pay off. I go to the movies a lot - many horror movies in the hope of finding ""the one"" that does not disappoint. Usually, the (mostly) teenage audience going to such movies tends to be quite annoying, talking, laughing etc.. Not with this one. I can't remember the last time seeing a horror movie audience being so mesmerized and quiet up until the last scene. Truly a masterpiece.",Hereditary

It was more like a chilly breeze here and there that died down pretty quickly. I got the movie, but it still made me go, ""WTF just happened"". lol The lead up to the climax was ok. But then the last half just started deflating for me. It's like they tried to cram everything else that's important into a smaller window. Do I recommend? Sure...if you have nothing better to watch, and feel like watching a Thriller (this wasn't Horror to me). It's a Filler movie. But I will give props to Toni Collette. I think she's a brilliant actor.

However, I got disappointed. It seems incredibly difficult to get an horror movie to actually make you lose one or two nights of sleep nowadays. 
The movie could have been better in many ways, I suppose. I mean, the acting is overall good. First of all, it takes a long time for something interesting to actually happen (you almost fall asleep during the first half) and by the time it gets to the part where things start happening, you end up getting disappointed because it's just one or two scenes... One good thing about it is that it doesn't have those predictable jumpscares but stil... 
After watching the trailer (and later the movie) and noticing that they were calling this movie the next Exorcist, I wonder where in the world they saw the similarities.

1466,DFagundes,Amazing technical achievement by Ari Aster,7,25 June 2018,"This is a first feature film from director Ari Aster. The technique was amazingly well done, setting new boundaries for the genre, while using the best aspects of the classics. The director showed that he really knows his craft. 
The film is very atmospheric, with a quiet pace and psychological tension that held my attention from the beginning. The technique and precision of image and sound are astonishing, and separates it from the other horror movies that we're used to watching. It settle the family drama really well, and it knew when to reveal and withhold information.
The supernatural aspects of the story contributed to the scary moments in the film, and although they were too over the top, the unpredictability of every scene and the technique used to build up the sensations that made us feel fear during those scenes actually overshadowed the story. 
By the end, I was taken a little off the characters due to the over-exposition of the story background, but throughout the whole movie I could connect with them emotionally. They were really well acted, and had dramatic nuances that made them human and multi-dimensional.
A very good film overall, that made me feel fear through my spine in several scenes, a psychological kind of fear the doesn't make me feel manipulated. I can't say it is exactly original, because it takes so many things from other films of the genre, specially the Shining and the Exorcist, but it is really well made, and the way it mixes art-house cinema with mainstream is what makes it emotional and entertaining both as a drama and a horror film.",Hereditary

If there was really Satan worship going on then there should have been some more explanation. It just seemed to be a bunch of random gross and shocking imagery and happenings strung together.
And, if the satanic ritual really was a success will they get all the riches or whatever they were after? What was the meaning of the miniatures the main character was making? Why was she climbing around on the ceiling? That was particularly bizarre.

And these expectations were, in my case, pretty damn high.
And I love horror movies. Everybody loves a good jump scare, as do I, but my favorites usually tend to be the slow-burning ones.
So this, naturally, seemed perfect.Hooooowever.
What I got, was a brilliant hour and a half of family drama (a genre I normally tend to avoid, really not my cup of tea) spiked with horror, and when I say horror I mean some genuinely horrifying moments - not the supernatural horror kind of horrifying, but actual-real-life-horribly-awfully horrifying - with amazing Toni Collette seemingly losing her mind, and the whole thing is so awesomely done you are almost ignoring the fact that, well, the story isn't really going anywhere, although the film uses a pretty classic form of storytelling, and the story IS supposed to go somewhere, anywhere really, or, you know, maybe even nowhere, and just leave you right where you are, asking yourself wtf just happened, not that I'd like it after the whole Exorcist hype, but... but the one thing you really don't expect, the thing that becomes painfully obvious in the last half an hour or so, is that it will quickly and irreversibly go down the idiot lane, and just end there, wanting you to believe that it's where it was supposed to end all along, when in fact you know that somebody just used footage from another movie and photoshopped main actors' heads there, because the producers lost the original ending in a terrible accident and just lost their minds and decided to pretend like nothing happened, and instead of postponing the air date, reshooting it and giving us the ending we, and this movie, truly deserved, they did THIS.
Giving it a 6 because the family drama was done WELL.
The horror might have been interesting too, unfortunately I have only seen the ending and some 'clues' that were equally forcefully introduced earlier, and it seemed kind of over-the-top, but you never know, the rest of the movie could've been OK.

This is the movie that really piqued my interest in A24 and Ari Aster, and I'm super thankful for that. I already loved Toni Collette and her acting in this movie is just...EXQUISITE. I'm writing this review on my 4th rewatch and every time it gets to the scene where Annie first speaks at the grief meeting I think to myself ""How did she not win an Oscar for this role?"" and even based on that scene alone. As someone who has lost someone close that I had a strained relationship with- my gosh, did she hit the realism out of the park. I bet she needed a few days to decompress after filming that scene.There are definitely some visceral (in the ""gut wrenching"" sense) images and it's got some parts that are hard to watch, and yet I choose to do it again and again because the movie is so good. At first I wondered if his reaction after ""the accident "" was realistic-just going in and laying in bed leaving his mom to discover the gruesome scene on her way out in the morning, but the more I thought about it, I find that pretty realistic too. That would be the type of trauma where the only way to physically function would be to go on automatic pilot while emotionally catatonic, and that's exactly what he does. And then the way she screams for her ""I just need to die!!!"" Ouch! The amount of pain this family has to deal with...and it never gets any easier for them. All the actors here are fantastic.

Toni Collette is great, as always but WTF is she doing in this??

It just turns into the director's usual BS, naked zombies, screaming, blood and gore and oh look, a young person gets crowned. Didn't all that happen in ""Midsommar""?

First, I'll review the film like I would any other and then I'm going to try and reason why audiences are reacting negatively to the film. I'm not sure if Hereditary is the greatest horror film ever but I certainly felt like I was watching my generation's Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby. The movie borrows heavily from those two films right down to the final scene. Despite this, it feels new and dangerous. I had no idea how the movie was going to play out which is a criticism I have with a lot modern horror/thriller movies. This in large part has to do with the marketing campaign but more on that later. I feel the term slow burn has a negative connotation associated with it and prefer to call this movie tense. It doesn't really on jump scares that plague a lot of modern horror and chooses tension and imagery to scare the audience with slow camera panning and fantastic cinematography, a nervous score, and great performances. Toni Collette gives and incredible performance as a manic mother who is mourning the loss of a parent. The supporting cast is fantastic as well and they all have a time to shine at some point in the movie. The movie is also challenging in its themes with relationships between parents and their children always in the forefront. The human drama of this movie far exceeded my expectations and is worthy viewing in its own right. To try and explain why audiences are trashing the film through some mediums (not as much on IMDb, see CinemaScore, Rotten Tomatoes for example) I think it is important to understand that we live in an impatient culture. Many horror classics of the past like the two I mention earlier weren't fast paced and instead lingered on images and favored slow paced horror. I think the modern horror audience can get restless when presented with a movie like this. I don't think Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist would review very well with broad audiences if they were released today. Secondly, I think the film has succeeded in making people uncomfortable by questioning parent's feelings for their children and how they are displayed. This movie is complex and has a lot to say. Comparing this film to another fantastic horror movie from this year, A Quiet Place, offers a great juxtaposition of this idea. One is very simple in it's premise that quickly gets to the scares while the other takes it's time to build to a climax that may or may not be worth the wait depending on the viewer. Overall, Hereditary offers plenty of horrific imagery and supernatural scares that work as a deeper examination of familial relationships rather than being a string a horror movie cliches.9/10 - excellent",Hereditary
1488,scratchthat2009,NOT A HORROR FILM,9,12 June 2018,"Most of the people reviewing this are COMPLETELY missing the mark. This is a drama about a maternal family line that deals with serious mental illness. It's filled with symbolism and you see the film through the sick perspectives of the characters. It's heart-wrenching and it will make you think. Sure, be scared, but think about the real plot too.",Hereditary
1489,shivamchowdhary336,"One of the best, most terryifing horror films I have ever seen - WORTH THE HYPE",10,8 June 2018,"Where to even start with this absolute roar of a film. I'll just go ahead and say this - Hereditary is absolutely brilliant. Just brilliant. It is a terrifying film written and directed by first-time director Ari Aster and stars Toni Collette in her finest role yet about the disintegration of a family. To say more about the plot would be too cruel - but, allow me to reiterate, Hereditary is TERRIFYING and one of the best horror films I've ever seen in my life.What I love so much about this film is it takes its time to introduce us to the characters - we get a sense of who the characters are within the first 20 minutes. It sets up the characters and develops them in a way that we don't usually see in horror films. Usually, they cut straight to incessant, annoying jump scares and give no backstory or character development. Hereditary makes you FEEL for the characters, so when you see their lives go awry, you truly feel it - psychologically and emotionally, because you really do care about these characters.The film only has a handful of jumpscares and relies much more on psychological tricks to mess with your mind. The film is incredibly intense and uncomfortable to watch for the first 80 or so minutes, before transitioning into full-blown Lynchian horror in the last 40. It never pulls back - the horror is traumatic, cruel, and relentless. It does not allow you to breathe - once it pulls you in with its cinematic tricks, you're stuck. Pure arthouse magic.It also has a very human side to it. All supernatural occurrences aside, it is at its heart an exploration into grief, and how grief is almost like a ghost, haunting the entire family. It is also a film about how grief is dealt with, and what lengths people would go to stop grieving.The score, cinematography and lighting is just brilliant. Ari Aster has set himself up for a talent not to be ignored. The fact that this is his first feature film is INSANE. The film is so well directed, you never would have guessed this is Ari Aster's first film. Brilliant.I will say this though - Hereditary is not a 'fun' horror movie like most, - you can't go in and expect to be thrilled. No, instead, the film is dark, depressing, disturbing, hard to watch and incredibly unbearable with its intensity levels. I did, at some points, especially during the traumatizing finale, want to leave the cinema because it simply became too much to handle for me. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad thing at all though.Overall, HEREDITARY is just terrifying. It grips you and doesn't let you go and just when you think it cannot get more shocking and disturbing, it does. Hereditary is truly a must watch and changes the game for modern, arthouse horror.",Hereditary

This film sets of the tone in a drama based speed that allows you as a viewer to get involved and build interest in the characters. As the story continues you start finding your self feeling uncomfortable, holding your breathe and feeling guilty for what is happening as if it's your fault. By the end of the film you are so engaged that when its all over you will need to breathe and perhaps see some comedy to get over it all. This film is for sure on my top 5 best horror films.

One of the most psychilogical scary films i've seen in a long time.

Throughout the film, I found myself laughing at the stupidity and the lack of common sense in the characters. Hereditary had scenes it could of done without along with 30-45 seconds of just looking at the characters such as Annie and Peter. After evaluating all that took place with a friend of mine, we made connections that gave this movie a glimpse of goodness. I think that Ari Aster shot for the stars when he created his target audience, meaning most of the movies symbols and its writing on the wall takes a good amount of critical thinking and intelligence to connect. I think any movie junkies best bet is to wait for this to come out on HBO. A real disappointment in my mind.",Hereditary

No cheap scares here, thick tension building atmosphere and bread crumbs of clues lead up to one of the most intense final acts I have seen in awhile.

The daughter is an interesting character but underused, the son on the other hand, is pretty bland.At least it isn't simply a jumpscare fest, like so much modern horror.

Not scary. Not a good story (what story/plot?). It borrows from a bunch of decent, notable horror films and dumps or ditches these referential elements almost randomly, never in support of the non-plot; it feels almost as if these hallmark horror elements are in there merely to sell the film and give it kudos, like ""oh wow, a scary film with a weird-looking, possibly possessed child and a burning person..."". I can barely think of one element in this film that actually supported the plot, instead elements and happenings just come and go. Now someone is probably going to turn around and say they think it's clever because they can't actually work out wtf is going on. No, it's not clever, it's just junk.I love Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne and the supporting actors and cast are all great.. and I guess they need to make money, but... I felt bad that they wasted their time on this stinker. A bunch of young guys were scoffing and laughing out loud increasingly as the film progressed at how preposterous this non-story was in the cinema.

This is one of the best horror movies so far this decade, it doesn't rely on jumpscares or loud noises like most horror films its more of an unconventional masterpiece. I loved the tension created in this movie and the editing choices were phenomenal and actually unsettled me alot. The acting in this movie is superb especially by the females in particular Toni Collette who actually in my opinion gives the best female performance of the year. The film does not feel claustrophobic but it does feel contained in these particular locations which adds to the horror of this movie. This is Ari Aster's first feature lenght movie as a director and now he's on my radar I can't wait to see what he does next because he has crafted this movie to almost perfection. The ending has to be the best but also the most unnerving endings I've seen. The only flaw I can think of is the exposition which I get it that in such movies characters have to speak out the exposition but I felt this movie would've been better with less vocal exposition like The Shining. In the end, Hereditary is a very gripping, unnerving and unconventional horror film the best infact since The Babadook, it combines the elements of art house and horror very well and its a must watch for all horror fans but viewer discretion is advised because of it's disturbing nature. I give it an ""A+"" and ""9.5/10"".",Hereditary
1505,tmb-79345,not a 10....not a masterpiece....not even close,4,8 April 2019,"The reviews for this movie were so wildly extreme and polarized that I decided to read reviews and spoilers while watching it.....a first for me. Anyone who thinks this is a ""masterpiece"", without being a pretentious twit, either scares easily or is a teenager. Giving it a 1/10 is a bit harsh. It is a bad movie. Poorly made, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly filmed but there was some money put into special effects and the acting, for the most part, is good. Toni Collette has made a career or grimacing and overacting which she does well here. But I'll never watch another Collette movie. Someone asked why Gabrel Byrne took the job. Well, he is the executive producer so he is really in it for the money. Ann Dowd is always good, always creepy. Poor little Milly Shapiro chose the worst role of her young life. Some scenes are more repulsive than horror....or for a good horror film. Some scenes which are most disturbing are also the most ridiculous. The movie borrows heavily on sights and sounds from other horror films. Not an homage...more of a theft. Creepy sounds from The Shining, creepy scenes from forgotten Exorcist movies. The director seemed a bit obsessed with loss of heads. All in all, Hereditary is a mishmash of ideas and the movie doesn't know what type of horror film it wants to be. Is it a ghost story? It is satanic worship? Who knows? The ending wasn't infuriating. It wasn't shocking. It wasn't brilliant. It is what it is....ridiculous.

We are presented with a series of MISERABLE characters...who go through MISERABLE experiences...and some act like they're zombies (the son Peter). And the rest are either in some sort of odd trance (the weird daughter) or hysterical (the mother) or emotionally removed (the father). One serious problem is that they are ALL UNLIKEABLE. Period. From the beginning - when the lead mom (played by Toni Collette) spews venomous comments about her mother AT HER MOTHER'S FUNERAL...We are supposed to get behind her journey? And as the film progresses...we get a plethora of cliches: (1) the seance - by the way makes no sense in terms of the story structure and feels totally contrived (2) the ghostly apparitions pop in and out - also makes NO SENSE (3) the naked old people ghosts at the end - that takes the story into a final implausible area.

But afterwards the movie just making me uncomfortable.. I never felt this way anytime I watched horror. It was weird I don't know how to put it in words. Usually horror movie depends on jumpscare and loud music that makes me surprised. But Hereditary is different. I could barely heard the music, no jumpscare, it is just different. but the movie is haunting me after the movie ended! I am not the type who get scared with scary scenes but Hereditary made me scared with only one scene (a bit spoiler: the mother and the rope) I can't get that scene out of my head even until now. I didn't feel scare when watching.. I felt terrified when I stepped out from the cinema. I didn't feel comfortable. I felt weird. I felt like going to throw up after watching.

It has to be to be one of the most hyped horror films of recent years and when expectations are raised it is almost inevitable that disappointment will follow. For once the hype is justified. Hereditary is a flat out Masterpiece. Not since watching The Shining on the big screen many decades ago have I been so mesmerized. Hereditary has been compared to the equally classic The Exorcist but I would go as far as to say it's an even better film than that classic. Not that it's a competition of course! Just an indicator of how good this film is. The direction and cinematography is superb. Ari Aster has come out of the gates with one of the most impressive debuts imaginable. The sense of dread he creates from the first frame to the last is palpable. What truly sets this apart from the vast majority of horror films is the level of performance. Every cast member is brilliant but Toni Collete should win every award going. I can't imagine seeing a better performance in 2018 by any actor and will surely be looked back upon as one of the iconic roles of the genre. If you like proper adult horror that demands your full attention you simply have to watch it. Not only the best horror of the year but the best film of the year.10/10,Hereditary

Then the cat comes out of the bag! The film is about witchcraft, demonic possession and the whole shebang so often seen in movies these days...and the movie picks up speed OMG! 
Toni Colette makes all these faces (in spite of a grand performance) where she looks more as if she chewed on a mix of Jalapeño & Dill Pickles than expressing horror/panic. 
Don't look for Gabriel Byrne he's as present as Colette's 'spider walk' is dull & laughable.

I really appreciated the sound design of this movie; it really sets the tone and I would argue that it's the ""scariest"" part of the movie. The acting has its moments, for better and for worst. At times it's very intense and uncomfortable, other times I was cracking jokes with my friends and couldn't stop laughing; I would say the cheap shock-value moments amplified that to an extent at times.Give it a watch, you definitely won't forget it.

Ari Aster deserved and Oscar for his direction of this film, and I'm shocked he wasn't even nominated; because the attention to detail he had to have to make this film is astonishing. Part of what makes this film so effective is Toni Collette's incredible performance. The problem with most horror movies is that they don't create characters relatable enough or likable enough for us to root for them. Ari Aster and Toni Collette, however, created a character that was so real that we felt was she was feeling and proved that what happened to her would happen to us if we were in her position.",Hereditary

Toni Collette stars in this film. It is way below her

Nonetheless, any given viewer will be confused as the film evolves, and the reason is {Milly as a child actress seems to be confused herself whether to be ominously unique or innocently beautiful in her actions and reactions}.2) To start dramatically and heart-breaking, then evolve into the world of spirits, then turn into a witchcraft theme, and then finally, into Godless, heathen themes indicates a lack of essence. So, the film lacks delivery or closure.3) The only character a viewer would believe is the mother ""Toni Collette"" due to her natural abilities as an actress while the rest of characters are merely trying and dare I say

I told him I definitely thought it was shocking and powerful, the first three times I'd seen the movie... back when it was called Rosemarys baby, The Conjuring, and The Babadook. The most generous interpretation you can give this film is that it's a clever remix of classic horror in its genre. The less generous is that it's a blatant rip off, which I find myself leaning more towards. The aforementioned films, among others (read: The Shining, even Donnie Darko) do everything that this film does, only 100 times better and scarier... often decades earlier. Despite the narrative thievery and the worn-leather tropes, I do have to give this film credit where credit is due: the craftsmanship is outstanding. The cinematography is nearly perfect, and the sound design is a master class. Also a big nod to the acting. These actors sure did a great job enduring scene after seeing of repeating the same state of insanity and horror through repeated scares.

1570,melanierose927,Naysayers Don't Appreciate Classic Horror,8,11 September 2018,"Ignore the negative reviewers - they want unimaginative plots with hackneyed jump scares at break-neck speed. This film knows how to build suspense with subtle, disconcerting occurrences amplified by a driving, menacing score. Hereditary moves at a deliberately slow pace to maximize anticipation while delivering enough twists and thrills to keep viewers riveted.With Charlie being featured prominently in the trailer, her death so early on comes as a shock (though one can see it coming in the moments leading up to it). Peter is unreactive. Both he and Charlie were reserved and seemingly unresponsive to the events in their lives, but this could be due to the trauma of nearly having been killed by their unstable mother years before. When Charlie is killed, Peter immediately goes into shock. He doesn't call the police, he doesn't look at Charlie's body (let alone retrieve her head), he doesn't inform his parents - he just goes home and goes to bed. While naturally there would be an investigation (and likely counseling), Peter barely registers what is going on around him. We see the next few weeks through his catatonic state, which is possibly why we aren't shown the turmoil that ensues after such an unexpected and grisly death of a close family member.Hereditary is more cerebral than I expected, and leaves viewers with lots of questions. Is Charlie actually possessed by a demon or her grandmother's spirit, or is she simply an introverted, troubled young girl trying to cope (i.e. by developing a clucking tic) with a distressing event that has strained her family's bonds? Is the family truly being plagued by demonic activity caused by Ellen's dalliance with the occult, or are Annie and her children battling mental illnesses that have been afflicting the family for generations? Is what we see terrifying supernatural phenomena, or paranormal delusions and hallucinations provoked by extreme stress and trauma? Who knows? With the exception of the final 10 seconds (that should have been left on the cutting room floor), this movie exceeds expectations. It's refreshing to see a film that leaves viewers wondering instead of ruining its potential greatness by pandering to an audience with limited intelligence and patience by explaining mysterious plot points and making every minor detail a clunky foreshadowing vehicle.The story and score are reminiscent of The Skeleton Key and The Shining, respectively, so I imagine if you liked both of those, Hereditary will take its place alongside them in your horror/thriller repertoire.",Hereditary

It's a trap that has been set for you. As a Screenwriter, myself, this film is a fantastic piece to study in terms of structure and execution.3/4 of the film operate as a tragic Family Drama. It's easy to forget that you paid to watch a ""Horror"" film. The acting and writing are so superb that you're convinced this film is a dread-soaked tale about loss, guilt, and grudge-holding.It is. But it isn't. By the time the credits roll, you'll feel a sort of evil presence (a dreadful haunting, if you will) that sticks with you for some time.Hereditary is a film that rewards second and third viewings. There are so many hints and pieces that are so easily missed while watching it for the first time. Hereditary is constantly telling you that things are only going to end one way, and when you're able to see/hear the prophetic imagery of that... it's truly chilling.""Midsommar"" Ari Aster's 2nd film, is worth the price of admission. It's almost worth double because watching it gives you a newfound appreciation for Hereditary and Aster's incredible ability to disturb you deep in your core.Ultimately, Ari Aster has made two Horror films that stand out in a crowd of what would otherwise be predictable jump-scare movies. But Hereditary is a phenomenal achievement in dread, terror, and tragedy.Ari Aster has gone on to reveal that Hereditary and Midsommar were the only Horror stories he has written so far. It seems like, genre-wise, Ari Aster will be moving away from Horror.TL; DR:Regardless of what Ari Aster does moving forward, THIS is the film he'll be primarily remembered for.

Love him, but his part was pretty short and meaningless. Toni Collette started off good crazy, but ended up just being ridiculous. Not her acting, but how the character was written. So many holes in the story it hurts my brain to try to see any connection of what happens through the first half of the movie to how it ends.So they turn the son into Jughead at the end and treat him like Rosemary's baby? ""Hail paimon"" And all the creepy stuff thru out the movie was just ridiculously random. They should have had him reading Archie comics that would have made more sense",Hereditary

1588,A_Night_In_The_Life,Ari Aster is No Polanski....,7,10 June 2018,"Hereditary by Ari Aster is a Mix Bag in all Categories.... from excellent storytelling to Questionable and some points laughable directions in sequences. It's hard to get into the film without giving away spoilers, so I'll just highlight the good and the bad. For starters the good, Toni Collette goes beyond expectations with her performance. Being both entertaining and Indulging. Others great performance in the film, Milly Shapiro. Giving enough of a unsettling character to have you feeling uneasy. In lesser hands, the role would have been forgettable. Unfortunately that's were I come to the bad, gabriel Burns which was shocking to me singe he's usually on point in his films but here didn't feel very involved. And was it just me, or did he drop trying to hide his accent with in 20 mins into the run time? Alex wolff was fine.... throughout the picture he was between fine and really? They're 
 not gonna try a second take? (Really needs to learn how to cry) For the directing aspect and cinematography the film does pull off some very memorable and even horrific shots. One in particular stuck with my wife and I even after we were leaving the theater. (Trust me you'll know it when you see it) But other shots were just too distracting that it took you out of the picture. I'm always for a film to have fun with its directing but you have to know when it too much. The one aspect I enjoyed the most were the little changes of details in background as the film progresses. From a few models being moved around, to a missing car in the driveway. All In all, Hereditarys only crutch is that it feels like the director was too busy trying to follow others Influences instead of focusing on what could've been his own master in horror. I give Hereditary 7 out of 10.",Hereditary

These days horror movies have taken a turn for the worst but this one raised the bar for the whole horror genre. This movie made me feel emotions that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. (Ie..2x in my life when someone close to me has died, I have laughed unintentionally due to severe emotional unease. ) I felt so uncomfortable on at least three different occasions, due to the horror, that I laughed out loud. An emotional roller coaster. This is a must see for anyone that enjoys horror period. It is my favorite movie of all time. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror movies..

1600,AEGYpTUS,good new type! i think that is enough,8,30 August 2018,"The movie ""Hereditary"" is a new and wonderful type of horror movies
A good step in the future of horror movies, especially what we see today :(
We can divide the film into two important parts
A tragic drama and a horror one
first let us see the ingredients of the main location ""the house"" and thank god it is not an isolated house in the forest :) the good thing of this location that it is big in somehow calm town and this leaves a great space for the director(Ari Aster) to create and make some good tricks.
the characters were really good designed as we see the main 4 are Annie,Peter,Steve and charlie as the plot was full of a wonderful the cast did the same 
the film somehow looks like ""get out"" the story starts with the death of Annie's mother funeral and some symbols were shown
Toni Collette and Alex Wolff were incredible maybe this the best acting i see in horror movie after the shining
this was the first experience for Ari aster i think in a horror movie and i think that we will a good young director in this type and i am waiting for his next film
the film had some little problems like the soundtrack and the shortage for horror i need more Ari
 s*** you gave the first part a lot of its requirements and the good flow of the story and finally i got only 20 great minutes are you kidding but at all this a really good unique horror-drama film 
but if he gave the end scene some more time i would be great
i think it deserves 8.5/10",Hereditary

1617,hello-81002,"Entertaining, visually satisfying and perfectly acted. But...",7,15 September 2018,"Aster deserves an eleven out of ten: I'm so proud to see such a debut from a director of my generation. Thirty-somethings are coming, Hollywood. This new wave will bring back some euro-style deepness without fear of the audience, and the audience will reward them with warmth.In Hereditary, there's a house above a house full of houses. There are puppets, masters of puppets and puppets that are masters of the masters of puppets. There are bonds, links, ugliness, motherhood, madness, gendericity, love, adolescence, pain, Satan. And Jesus? No, God never comes into play even if in the end Jesus is somehow mocked and, as a consequence, invoked. Actually, God and God's ministers and symbols are removed/replaced from the beginning of the movie: there is no hope, there is no way out of the hell for the characters.Unfortunately, the viewer is constantly kept safe in his chair, far from the painful mess he witnesses. Why? Because of the gondry-esque, faerie production design and because of a little naïveté in the plot: for example, a couple of Wolff/Peter and Byrne/Steve reactions really break the suspension of disbelief, and you know who Dowd/Joan really is the exact second she appears. Furthermore, Dowd always phagocytize her characters in the name of an impeccable but tangible acting. Shapiro/Charlie is a pleasant surprise, and Collette/Annie is just perfect: a more jonze-esque than gondry-esque production design, a little more writing malice and a Kathy Bates in the role of Joan would have condemned the viewer to vulnerability, turning this fantastic effort into a masterpiece.Heredity is entertaining, visually satisfying and perfectly acted.

I was excited to watch this movie and even more so when I saw Gabriel Byrne's name. The movie began well and I was drawn in from the beginning. Charlie, played by Milly Shapiro, was a fantastic character. She was quiet and creepy and had the perfect sound effect. Peter, played by Alex Wolff, was a decent minor character.
While I agree with a few reviews as a modern day horror film the setup with this movie was great but it didn't deliver on what on any of it. No a horror film doesn't need to be cheesy with the expected make-you-jump moments but you know what it should have? Dialogue not just long scenes of dead silence and awkward stares that don't evoke any reaction from the viewer. There was far too much ""telling of a story"" than seeing the story unfold. For that the director should be blamed. No one watching a movie wants to hear about a scene that could have created an actual sense of angst if had been shown.
I lost interest in this film around the end of the first hour. I was hopeful when an actual plot arose and details unfolded but it all crashed and burned to the ground when we made it to the end. I was angry when I saw what we waited 2 hours to see. It was darn right stupid!
It is movies like this as to why movies like the Halloween and Friday the 13th franchise have outlived all others. You don't expect great writing or developed scenes. You expect a group of people to be picked off one by one by a known but unknown villain in seen and gruesome ways...and Hollywood delivers on it!

It's not the best thing you've ever layed your eyes upon. There are worst things in life. However, the ending is as bad as it's with the Ritual movie (or VVitch). As if the ending doesn't have to be as strong as the build up. On the contrary, it has to overshadow all the horror that superceeded it.
This ending is as if someone phoned it in, after beeing asked to wrap up the script, and fast. Collette solely carried this project on her shoulders. ""Paimon"" is a joke. He should be in Disney movies. I like Shapiro, curious about where her career goes.",Hereditary

At her grandmother's funeral, why is 13-year-old Charlotte dressed as if she's going camping?? Where's the respect? She's 13, not 5, old enough to be dressed appropriately.2. When leaving the funeral, mother asks daughter if the chocolate she's eating contains nuts, establishing the fact that the daughter has a serious nut allergy. Why then when mother forces daughter to attend a high school party with her older brother, does she not ask daughter if she has her Epi-Pen? Mother doesn't know what kind of food will be served, and nuts are a pretty common snack at such events. Surely mother would ask older son to make sure younger sister doesn't consume anything containing nuts!3. Charlotte has a bad reaction at the party after eating nuts. Older brother doesn't ask if she's carrying an Epi-Pen, doesn't call 911, but decides it's a good idea to drive his sister to the hospital. After hearing a loud thud from the back of the car, he doesn't look around to see if she's alive or dead (or missing her head), sits in the car doing nothing for the longest time, then drives home and.... climbs into bed??3. Joan teaches Annie how to communicate with the dead in a three-minute lesson, then not long after Annie tells her family she has the gift and she too can speak with the dead? Come on! Seriously? It would have been just as laughable if she'd pulled out a copy of ""Seances for Dummies"".4. What was the point of the son smashing his face into the desk when he's the chosen one?5.

I love horror genre the most, and watch horror films predominantly. Now, let me confess it's one of the best horror films, if not the best.....but my fav so far.2. I've read about other reviews, but to be honest I cannot stop laughing on some reviews. One claims that Toni's acting was over the top. Brother, you people probably don't show emotions at all. But, the scream after her on screen daughter's death was pretty much natural to me as an Indian. Again, maybe not all western parents feel the attachment so deep with their child, that's why they don't get that emotions....but if a mother suddenly loses her child, and she had the deep attachment, she must be screaming after such a tragic death where she finds her own daughter's headless body inside the car. My own uncle died at 21 in an accident, been 8.5 yrs, still my grandma couldn't overcome it, she's been kind of a psycho to be precise. So, I don't find Toni's acting dramatic.3. I don't know if you read about the storyline of a movie on wiki after watching. That reveals a lot in case you yourself couldn't make it out during the watch. Probably people who couldn't connect all the things in order are shouting at its sense. Bruh, once read the story, it'd take hardly 5 mins but you'll not be disgusted with this movie anymore.4. For me, the concept is unique, the links are clear, the order is ok, the acting is superb. People always try to drag down anything better, I'm here to state what basically the fact is.5. Horror movies don't mean jumpscares, sudden creaks, loud scream, and running after the sound throughout the movie and leading to nothing...lol.It shows how to disturb your intellect, how to show nothing scary, still thinking about the movie throughout the day.6. The emotion is a large part of the film, the adrenaline rush isn't all, the sad feeling of an unfortunate death of a little girl haunts, creates a sense of pity.7. So, why I snatched a star away, because I can't watch it nonstop (according to IMDb status), my eyes will ache. I can watch it many more times without hesitation.

1638,ictrw,Best Horror Film of the Decade?,10,22 November 2020,"Ari Aster looks at horror-thriller legends George A Romeo, Wes Craven, John Carpenter and so many more and laughs in their face with his feature film debut. Ari Aster's mind is a place most couldn't dream up in their worst nightmare's worst nightmare. Hereditary goes well beyond the most terrifying film you've seen and amplifies it tenfold by doing one simple thing: applying an eerie sense of normalcy. By creating a perfect medley of undeniable woe and despair that all too many have experienced in reality and adding a disturbing element of gruesome subplot leads this to being arguably the best horror thriller of the decade and quite possibly the century. Aster's ability to tap dance the line of being subtle and bold is undeniable and without question the best since Hitchcock. Aster quite simply is the best in the genre right now and there just isn't anyone close even for those who try so desperately to include Eggers in the same league.

This is how.I had no expectations, just saw a 7.3 IMDB rating for a horror-ish movie and was intrigued.The camera work, lighting and effects as well as the acting from the actors are great, but I can't help but feel that there's just something wrong with the casting and the characters of the children.Hobo clothes and wet look, they're casted to be younger-than-they-really-look. It annoys me a bit from the get go, but I lean back and tell myself to look past these annoyances to enjoy the unfolding of the story and plot.The story does twist and turn a bit by throwing rubble in the gears and a stick in the wheel, but I slowly realize that this is nothing more than another witchcraft movie.I don't know what it is about witchcraft movies that gets on my nerves... I just find it ridiculous, especially because they are often over-the-top stories instead of staying near the ground. This movie confirms the rule and it's just unbelievable.This movie is extremely overrated. It's a 5-6 depending of how you feel about witches.I'm gonna give it a 3 just because overrated movies are a menace to movie watching. Oh and 3 rather than one because of Toni and the better-than-average visual style.P.S. Maybe I'm just getting too old for IMDB? Naah, because I love Ash vs Evil Dead and that's both witchcraft, occult and fun, so this movie can just suck my boomstick!",Hereditary

Because boy did you succeed!It started out as a dreary family drama, which is enterily plausible for a horror.But for a dramafilm, it felt like it lasted for 2 hours already watching the first 30 minutes. 
And it goes downhill very very fast.. but the movie becomes even more slow.Anything that seemed remotely interesting was destroyed almost immediately whenever something was introduced that might have saved it from utterly failing as a horrorfilm. It was a pure horror idd, a horror to watch and realize i've wasted 2 hours of my life. In that essence it was the best horror film ever. with other words, the best prank ever pulled on a international level.If you are a horrorfan, even in the B-movie segment, ignore this film.

1646,mdcagle454,Stunning Atmospheric Suspense,10,20 January 2019,"Let me start by saying I was very skeptical of this movie. I'd heard and read reviews that spanned from ""best horror movie ever"" to ""complete waste of time"". I realize this is the way of the world nowadays with every opinion slipping into extreme ends of the spectrum. So, I started this movie with a reserved sense of curiosity, knowing I would probably love it or hate it. Well I'm happy to say I loved it. I watch a lot of horror movies and I don't know if any movie accomplishes what Hereditary does in the way it does it. I'm hard pressed to find a film that so perfectly sets the stage of an emotional, atmospheric plunge into a suspenseful, lonely hell. This movie is a bag over the head, punch in the face rollercoaster ride. I havent watched a movie that more successfully uses music to create a creepy atmosphere. Instead of in your face gory effects and jump scares (which I do enjoy as well), this movie slowly lulls you into a place where discomfort and emotional dispair slowly seep into your subconscious. I found I kept asking myself ""what the hell is going on"", in the best possible way. The creepy factor of this movie is out of the stratosphere and you're not even fully aware until it ends and you remember you're not living the character's purgatory. The plot and excecution are unique and the creepy ""background"" scares are amongst the best I've seen. I would recommend this movie to anybody that likes horror/suspense.",Hereditary

I am not a horror fan in the way that I need jump scares to make a movie scary. I crave true horror and suspense. This barely has either. I don't care how good the cinematography or acting was, when there is nothing going on in the story, all of that is pointless. The gorey parts were good but so few and far between that you will most likely fall asleep before the next scene.

1651,tyrael84,First time I've logged into IMDB in 10 years just to review this....2nd review ever.,10,13 July 2018,"Quick preface, yes I do love horror movies - anything from zombies to slasher films to your supernatural and all-too-human and real thriller types etc etc. I always have and I've seen more than I could even begin to count. You could say I have a bit of an affinity for horror movies, sure, but that doesn't cloud my mind when it comes to identifying a turd vs a masterpiece.Hereditary is as close to a masterpiece as I have seen though I wouldn't brand it as a masterpiece for the simple fact that it's a bit too akin to ""perfect"" and nothing is perfect. There is not a single jump scare, not a single loud burst noise meant to startle you, nothing purposeful and obvious anyway (or at all). It's just a pure, unadulterated creepfest. Eerie, disturbing, uncomfortable, unsettling - all words I would absolutely use to describe this movie in the best way possible.Many horror movies and thrillers like A Quiet Place (also a great film) have some very suspenseful scenes. But those are just scenes. Temporary settings in which the director can build up suspense to some fun climax. All I will say about that aspect of Hereditary is at a certain point, the entirety of the movie put me in a long, sustained state of suspense. Nearly literal edge-of-my-seat kind of thing except that I was too comfortable leaning back.I don't even see it necessary to get into any sort of specifics with this film. Read the synopsis and reviews, etc etc. Just know that it is so much more than any words can truly describe. Do yourself a favor and see it. For me, an avid moviegoer especially concerning horror movies, this thing is a gem. Wonderfully acted, the soundscape and landscape is just so damn perfect. Off-screen noises coupled with a very appropriate visual just fills you with a sense of dread at times for what is happening on screen. I absolutely loved this movie. It affected me more than any other movie in recent memory, maybe ever. I truly, truly do not understand even in the slightest how this movie is getting anything less than a 7 or an 8. These clowns bashing it and giving it a 1 are off their rocker. I don't know what they were watching but it wasn't Hereditary. My only guess is they were expecting some obvious jumpy typical Hollywood scary movie that didn't present them with obvious, orthodox scares. I was so stunned to see ANY 1s at all much less several. Ignore them entirely. Just see it.",Hereditary

But this was such a bad movie. Story, editing and pacing were a complete mess. Few ""scary"" parts, that weren't actually scary. At the middle point, I wanted to walked out and later regreted not doing it. Near the end, people started laughing at my screening. I started laughing too because it was so ridiculous and badly executed. People comparing this movie to ""The Exorcist"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Babadook"" and ""The Witch"" make me laugh so hard.

Maybe it's the pace. But there is something here so visceral and intense that I feel like comparing it to the likes of The Shining and The Exorcist.This movie, from the very beginning, feels extremely sad and hopeless. It never lets up for even a second. Even when things are fairly normal near the beginning, it feels weird, like something is lurking at every turn.When things start happening, man they REALLY start happening. There are some chilling moments here. Mind you, the creepiness here doesn't come from visually horrible things, or jump scares. The scares in this movie linger, creeping up on you when you least expect it. I saw this movie two weeks ago and when I go to sleep I always remember the fate of this family and get chills. It is really that effective. And I've never felt this way with any movie, like EVER.And then there's the acting. Oh my god, the acting is like a punch in the gut and three in the face. I was particularly impressed with Alex Wolff, especially in the infamous car scene. And Toni, please, have all the awards already!All in all, it's a remarkable film, that puts the horror in the grief and heart wrenching loss this family is going through.

No idea why. No one else in my family likes them, but I always have, from a very young age.I've seen some very good horrors, and some mediocre and some just plain awful, the mediocre and plain awful being the majority over the last few years, with the exception of World War Z. Zombie genre is definitely my go to, but so are possession films, The Exorcist being my first experience of one.So I have to say thank you to Ari Aster for writing and directing this film. The story was great (save maybe for the very last few minutes), although it is still worthy of a 10/10. The acting was also brilliant. Toni Collette was perfect in this role, but she always is in any role she takes on.As for the scares/horror factor, this film totally freaked me out. I jumped, hid behind my hands and even screamed (or should I say made a strange grunting sound), numerous times throughout. EXCELLENT - and a long, long time coming. TOP MARKS.And for any doubters of reviews out there who will possibly read mine, compare it to others and presume I'm somehow related to this film, as I do myself when I read reviews against some of the films I've watched, I can assure you I am writing this purely because I felt I had to.

The ending ruins the entire movie, it's just a cheap, overused (lately at least) cliche. If it had all just ended differently and the twist had been different this could easily have been the creepiest and best horror movie in decades! It's such a shame that the great acting from Toni Collette and Milly Shapiro were wasted on a cop out ending. Since I want to write a spoiler free review I will not explain the ending. But it twist the entire story in a really bad way and make the previous scares a lot less creepy.

A long time filled with horror movie junk. So much junk had been made in this genre, that i've reach the point that i consider a 5.8 IMDB rating an actually pretty decent score for a horror. This movie deserves significantly more than 5.8/10. The 7.7 average score it's getting now, a little too much in my opinion.Cinematographically, this movie is very good. I love how it plays with light and dark. I was impressed how it made some things barely visible in the half dark, but not in the lame way most horror movies do it: namely by just making it too dark to see. No, the scary stuff was clearly visible, but they made it so that you only realise an instant later what you're looking at. They even did it the other way around at some point, and i think most of us recognize the situation: you wake up in the middle of the night, and a person seems to be sitting on a chair in some kind of crooked posture. Turns out it's just a heap of your own clothes.
I also remember a scene with a candle in the dark, and how it slowly lights op the people around it. Or the little trick where they skip time ahead by switching from a night to a day view of the forest house, synced to the music. Might have been done before, but i loved it.
Or filming someone walking through a hall, from the ceiling viewpoint, thereby filming her upside down as if she was walking on the ceiling, then continuing to track her while she walks underneath the camera, thereby automatically filming her upright again for the remainder of the hallway. This definitely has been done before. Might almost be cliché. But it was done well and it was fitting.Special effects, some good, some i'm less enthousiastic about. The gory props were very well done. Gruelingly realistic. The light effects that had to do with spiritual activity, i don't know. I think it would have been better if they'd just omitted those. The casting and acting were also good. Toni Colette was born for this, and i mean this as a compliment. She can express horror like noone else. Gabriel Byrne is also always a safe choice for a scary flick, although ironically he is the most stable and normal character in the whole thing. 
The daughter, great choice, just perfect how she looks kinda ""weird"" (again i don't mean this disrespectfully but factually it is part of why she was cast in this role obviously), and you can't wrap your head around what's her deal.
Ann Dowd, well right now everybody's watching her in ""Handmaid's"", and we know to instantly distrust her. Made me kind of ambivalent actually about if that was a good thing. Obviously she can play these roles very well, but on the other hand, the first shot she was in, i instantly recognized her although she was all the way in the left of the frame, and in that instant i guessed half of her story for the rest of the movie. So casting her might have been a little too obvious.The son, argually one of the most important roles storywise, i have some problems with. Admittedly, playing an adolescent boy (which brings a world of sorrow in its own), who gets confronted with such extreme circumstances is no easy task. But this guy is a professional actor, and we reviewers here measure every actor's performance by the same objective standards (that last sentence has to be read with a little bit of a sarcastic undertone).
That scene where he started crying..? Dude, that's how a 6 year old cries. I get that people in these circumstances might actually cry like a 6 year old, but in the movies it's just weird. Also by the end, where the movie gets more focused on him , i got the idea that the actor was struggling more and more with how he should actually express what's in the script.But hey, what wásn't wrong with that ending. Talk about ruining a skillfully built up experience in the last 15 minutes. That was absurd? I really believe something went wrong in the process of making this movie. Out of budget so they couldnt shoot the original ending? Script wasn't finished yet by the production deadline? Sure seems like something like that happened. Thinking back, the break was actually a little earlier, before the endgame started. The hypothesis about how something went wrong productionwise can also be supported by what happens to the lead character there. We are meant to relate to her, feel for her, think from her perspective, for most of the movie. Then suddenly, right before the endgame starts, she's suddenly one of the ""other characters"". We can't understand or trust her anymore, and the viewpoint to which we can anchor our perspective is gone. 
This is just weird, and i can't understand why professional movie makers don't know why you should always be able to see things from the perspective of some kind of protagonist. Or rather, how when you have that protagonist, you shouldn't suddenly and for no reason change the role of that character to which you have learned to relate.Now about the actual final part.
I read in one of the other user reviews that the audience started laughing, so i feared it would be another terrible movie, but i was happy to find that an hour or so into the movie it wasn't bad at all. But at the end, yes, in my theater too quite a few people started laughing (and i live in the Netherlands, we are a lot less vocal in the movie theater than Americans are!). 
Me, i was just groaning and facepalming. Oh no. Why..
I can't go into much detail without spoiling. But i can point out another rule they should have known exists, and therefore shouldn't have broken. Don't over explain what's going on! The Exorcist doesnt end with a long exposition about who Pazuzu is and why and how he went after Regan, does it? It's totally unnecessary and undermines the mistery and inconceivableness of the whole situation. I took the movie quite seriously for the most part, but at that point it just became totally lame.All in all, this movie deserves a solidly positive score. It was beautifully made, i was genuinely scared, it had great acting, and the story started out quite well. I would even watch it again, despite that ending. A proper ending would have made this an 8/10 though.",Hereditary

It was creepy, uncomfortable, suspenseful, and shocking (when the mom is on the ceiling banging her head!!!! Eeek!) .....until the end. The ending was lame and it felt like they didn't know how to end it. I'm all for ""can't always have a happy ending"", that's fine. And I got it, it didn't fly over my head. Some people said they had to watch it more than once to get it, I did not. Weird movies are my bread and butter. Grama is a ""head"" satanist, summons a demon, demon gets into little girl, can't survive there because she's a girl and sick, has to move to other people, moves to the mom temporarily when the girl dies, ultimately moves to the son, makes him kill himself so he can have the body to himself.

Hereditary is an atmospheric, truly dreadful film. It has a heavy and ominous atmosphere, accompanied by a plot that capitalizes on the audience's feeling of empathy. The family in the film undergoes experiences that are emotionally disturbing, a sense which is masterfully conveyed to the audience. Yes, there are largely dramatic elements in the film, but they bolster the horror element wonderfully. This is a slow burning, grueling experience, as you genuinely feel included in the family's experiences. There are few, if no, jump scares that I recall. The horror is so ingrained in the film that jump scares are not required. One scene involving a bedroom exemplifies this point, though I won't spoil it. See this film, though understand it is not the immature horror flick that offers immediate gratification through gore and jump scares. I left the theater feeling exhausted emotionally.",Hereditary

and I'm 30.I have watched so many horror movies hoping that one will manage to make me turn on the lights at 2am.
And this one did.To be honest, I have been making noises before walking that long hallway in the house. In my mind I did this so that the ghosts know I'm coming and that I know that they are there.. so to not try anything funny.This is what Hereditary did to me.Hereditary is a straight forward,
bold as as Trump,
no question about it,
no ghost doodoo movie that does what it is supposed to do:
to scare the hell out of you..

1747,kristybwall-48146,More questions than answers,4,4 September 2018,"Started out interestingly enough. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne are awesome. I dont the kids were cast accurately. I liked how they use the support group to fill in the backstory but there was zero reaction in regards to all the terror and tragedy this family had endured. I liked Collette's monologue at the dinner table, after the daughters death. The family dog doesn't show up until 2/3rds of the way through the movie, so why include him at all?. Why are the bodies included in the final ritual? They spend alot of time on the miniatures but theres no significance to them? Why are there naked people at the end? Who are they? They have no significance to the story other than to illustrate how many followers there are, I guess. I heard a lot about this movie and was excited to see it, but in the end it just couldn't deliver. I'm disappointed.",Hereditary
1748,zfischer-20437,This Generation's Exorcist,9,4 September 2018,"I don't like slow burn movies like The Witch or It Follows. They usually are so careful and plodding, that when the Big Thing that happens in the end comes around, I'm usually just glad it's over. But Hereditary kept me glued to the screen the whole time, never letting me go, plodding along and gripping me the whole way through. And when that Big Thing happens, holy moley does it happen.Hereditary is about...well...uh...a grandma dies....and...and then some weird stuff starts happening. It's hard to really get into this movie without ruining it. The story really takes some twists and turns, slowly feeding you information along the way, horrifying you all the while. It feels more like a family drama than horror at times, but then something will happen and remind you that you're here to be real spooked. Everyone in this film does a fantastic job of playing their part. Toni Collete is a FORCE as the mother. She is crazy and complex. Collete really puts on a show here and drives this one home. Alex Wolff, who plays the son, gives a great performance here as well. The best and most shocking scene in the whole film is given to him, and he nails it out of the park. And don't even get me started on the little girl, Milly Shapiro. She dosen't say much, but she had a presence in this movie like no other. The camera work is amazing. As Toni Collete's character makes models and dioramas, the whole films feels like you are trapped inside one with this family. Don't expect jump scares in this either. The horror in this movie is plain and KNOWS it's scary. It dosen't need any frills or build up for it to scare or horrify you. The effects in the movie are all practical as well, so it really adds that realistic factor of the horror.The only issues I had with this movie are that it drags a bit a few times, and one of the special effects looked very unrealistic when it happened. It was near the end in the son's bedroom when something was on the wall. When it crawled away, it didn't look very believable to me and jarred me out of the magic that had been established already.All and all, catch this movie. Easily the best movie I've seen this year all around. It'll take a really special movie to knock this one out of that front place. With the subtle scariness, to the brutal horror, this movie is everything you'd want out of a good classic horror movie.",Hereditary
1749,spidercage,The power of low IQ will give this a one,9,7 November 2019,People who have actually lived a life will understand this movie. People with hollow heads should check out Avengers instead. The latest one is better than Taxi Driver! That's amazing!!!!!As far as this movie goes the plot is fairly good and the actors di a great job. It's not that scary but it's disturbing a bit.

The movie finishes with secrets about the grandmother being in a cult .. because who couldn't see that coming.
the family gets sacrificed so that the boy in the film can become the quote unquote ""cult god"".

I don't lose sleep over much. However Hereditary is a different breed of film. This was a slow burn horror like I have never seen. I found myself frequently exhaling from holding my breath for minutes at a time. Where lesser films would rely on cheap jumpscares and loud scores to scare you, Hereditary simply boils, and boils, and boils. There are images and situations in this movie that are not for the faint of heart, and which I'm still having a hard time getting out of my head. Keep in mind, I'm an avid horror viewer, not a lot scares me anymore. By the time the credits rolled on this movie I was sweating, my hands were shaking, and I was out of breath, not even wanting to keep looking at the screen. I have never been physically exhausted from watching a movie before, but Hereditary did it, and for that I commend it.
This is a brilliant horror film and arguably the best post-millenial horror ever made. I would encourage you to give it a watch, but beware, this one will stick with you. There are very upsetting images and moments that some may be unable to handle.",Hereditary

Here the users have given it 8 out of ten stars and Rotten Tomatoes users are giving it 59 percent. They both seem way too high.This movie started very slow and relied more on a creepy uncomfortable atmosphere than an actual story. It also had a lot of clunky foreshadowing but by the time anything came out of any of it I had already stopped caring. Eventually something interesting happened and I thought it would finally start moving but then this movie pumped its brakes hard and went right back to creeping along at a painfully slow pace. Towards the end (like the last 10-15 minutes) it started to move and I realized that all of the threads planted throughout the movie ended in a giant tangled mess of horror movie endings that have been done before, that don't match and really just feel silly. Toni Collette is a great actress probably the closest thing to a saving grace of this film, but sadly it's not enough. Save your money. You won't regret skipping this film in a theater.",Hereditary

It's not that I didn't think the movie had any good attributes. Some of the acting was very good and the setting was generally creepy. The plot had some potential as well. But it wasn't scary. At best, there were some creepy moments. Nothing that had me on the edge of my seat though. Nothing jarring. The characters started to get on my nerves after a while, perhaps because the movie was overly vague and slow at times. The only one I was left with any sympathy towards the end for was Peter, and mostly just because he had to put up with everyone else. But What really made me dislike the movie was the end. It explains everything and yet still leaves you with a WTF feeling. It goes as far as to undo the creep factor of the entire rest of the movie. It's comically UNscary and poorly executed.

1784,coach150,"Chilling, Creeping, Shocking",8,6 September 2018,"Growing up as a young kid I was always fascinated and intrigued by the shocking and the horrific. From a pre-teen era I had developed a key interest in the horror genre. Throughout the years this interest diminished as horror flicks and blood/gore filled movies monopolized this genre. Very few movies managed to achieve the fear and creeping factor that is necessary for a horror movie to be truly what it needs to be, horrific. Hereditary has managed exactly that! You experience a range of emotions that you rarely experience in a modern horror movie. Many say that the movie is the new modern Exorcist, but I believe that it has more of a 60's feel to it resembling old horror-mysteries such Rosemary's Baby. Moving on to the direction, sound score, sound editing and acting you find yourself encapsulated in a a near-perfect horror picture. Finally you cannot review this movie without praising the Toni Collette's amazing performance in the lead role of Annie Graham.

1789,iv_vivy,Failure as a horror movie - disrespectful of serious mental illnesse,4,29 September 2018,"Were you wondering why I am wasting another two hours of my life to write this much, here it is. The bottom line impression is - disrespectful. Disrespectful of all those undoubtedly talented people and their effort resulting in great acting, great photography, scenography, music, lightning. Even worse, although I do believe it was unintentional, disrespectful of all those suffering from serious mental illness. No one with an ounce of personal experience, with their own or close family member issues of the sort, would have made such mistakes. And the worst - comparing a mentally ill person to hell king?!?!? This is so so hurtful and offensive! 
 
Thank God for all those people who don't have to know how dreadful the face of serious mental illness is. Enjoy your luck, be happy, feel grateful and humbled and, please, do not tempt your fate by presuming your artistic imagination is deep, mature, out of the box, intellectual enough to fully grasp the concept of real life pit-bottom darkness and agony of insanity.I've read quite a few reviews here and was extremely surprised with both good and bad reviews. None of them pointed out enough or at all (?!?!!?) the core point of the whole story. 
So, I am going to ""reveal"" that point right away: real life horror of mental illnesses especially hereditary ones. 
The doom you cannot prevent, avoid or deflect in any way and can only helplessly sit and watch completely aware how it is slowly overtaking your mind and ruining yours and life of those you care most about. And yes, it is a true horror and hell on earth, but those two words are not to be used literally when depicting the said point. That is the problem with this movie. Now, those of you in search of a real horror movie skip it - it won't quench your thirst. Horror here is just a brush used for painting a family tragedy. In the second part, a brush used badly and sadly... While horror is a tempting way to express subject such as madness growing and developing in your head and in heads of your children and since it is in your genes it is your fault and on top of that you are mourning the death of your mother, whom you love of course but at the same time hate and blame for burdening you and your children with that terrible cross to bear - it requires a truly gifted artist and an exceptionally mature person to pull that off decently and stay away from failing bizarrely half way there. The theme of the movie is so heavy, hard, serious, complex, like ""A Brilliant Mind"" times 3 and then add a horror layer to that. Very easy to go cheesy. It would require like, you know, genetic splice between Ron Howard and Alfred Hitchcock... And Ari Aster obviously isn't anywhere near there, at least yet. It's exactly like when you ask a child what they want to be when they grow up and the answer is - Superman, and it's super cute they chose a selfless superhero but it ain't gonna happen. Bite more than you can chew. Mental illness signs are all over from the very begging. Subtle ones at the funeral like Annie is wearing the same necklace as her dead mother meaning she is ""in the club"" not at all unaware of what's going on; creepy grinning blond guy and the woman putting something on the dead grandma's lips and however disturbingly strange that is nobody seems to notice or sees them at all except the granddaughter; words Annie uses in the eulogy to describe her mother (which, by the way, are not particularly flattering given the occasion) like suspicious, secretive, rituals, anxieties, completely disregarding other people's opinion and so on - overall leaving the impression of a paranoid person living in her own 'reality'; regarding her mother's character Annie even says ""that explains me /Annie herself/"" - again she is ""in the club"" and aware; something is obviously wrong with the granddaughter, her strange behaviour, creepy figurines she makes, at the funeral drawing her mother, Annie, as a shark toothed monster...  And then the major clue - group therapy. It is not actually a clue but totally straightforward literal explanation! Annie says it all. Her mother suffered from severe DID - Dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder (and none of the reviews I've read even mentioned that!!!), later on from dementia as well and towards the end lost it all together. 
Her father suffered from psychotic depression and starved himself to death. 
Her older brother had schizophrenia and hanged himself. 
Annie herself was forced (!!!) to go to group therapy a couple a years ago. When they had their first child, a son, Annie's husband enforced a no contact rule regarding her mother which Annie, as it seems, gladly accepted. Grandma was reintroduced into their life when they had their second child, the above mentioned girl. It is obvious from the very first scene the girl was very close to her grandma but Annie refers to that as ""she /grandma/ immediately stabbed her hooks into her /girl/"". That actually means that the girl, unlike her brother, showed the signs of mental disorder early on and as such gravitated towards already gravely ill grandma who ""understood"" her unlike Annie who tries to enforce ""normal"" life upon her. Of course Annie is ridden with guilt for having a bad relationship with her mother, for passing the illness to her daughter, for being unstable herself, for ruining the life of her family. And so on and so forth. 
I mean, come on, what more do you need to understand this movie is not really about ghosts, demons, cults, witch king?!?!?!? These horror elements are just a metaphor. A bad, cheap but most of all unbelievably childish metaphor. 
It's a pity though, the beginning of the movie was promising, while it was still just flirting with controlled amount of horror details, like chilling atmosphere, sense of something being wrong but not knowing exactly what, extreme stress and grief making people seeing or rather feeling things not actually there, freaky accident etc.
But, when the actual 'flesh and blood' horror kicked in... it became a hot mess. From the gut wrenching tragedy so overwhelming it was a very real horror in its own right, the movie took a salto mortale into the lamest religious trash horror ever. If you remember that moment in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" when everybody in the bar suddenly turned into vampires? And for a moment you are not quite sure whether you fell asleep and have a bad dream or someone unnoticed slipped some 'spice' into your drink or something... Only Aster isn't Tarantino either... Nor this transition is a deliberate clean cut intended to shock. 
So, you are left in disbelief, thinking to yourself and hoping for like half an hour ""oh, no, he is not going there, really he couldn't, could he...?"" and he could. The whole package together with candles, glass moving on its own, holding hands around the table, decapitated rotten corpses, man burning alive, both ghosts and demons, hell kings. 
Oh yes, and naked ghosts and naked cult followers, like being naked is somehow an unmistakable sign of hell and/or crazy... And yes, we all have our personal demons and ghosts from the past but really? Oh, we have skeletons in our closets as well; luckily Aster must have forgotten about those, otherwise some bones would have been rolling all over the screen for sure. 
And most of all, the blue light chasing children and entering them literally. It is, you know, the mental illness virus passing from victim to victim... No wonder every other review mentions people at the theatre laughing. No matter whether you choose to file this movie as predominantly a family drama-tragedy or as a horror or just haven't paid enough attention to the hereditary mental illness issue or didn't get it at all or simply love ghosts - it is so so lame and forced and trashy and fake that every each way it doesn't work! Girl decapitated, grandma decapitated, Annie decapitated. In case you don't follow this sophisticated allegory here it goes - whoever went full blown crazy was relieved of their head. Seriously??? The best you could do is to compare losing your mind to literally losing, no not losing, chopping off head?!?!?! Ok, the newest edition lunatic kept his and instead was even crowned, but no doubt is going to be guillotined in the sequel, when his crazy reaches full potential. It's wrong on so many levels that I am in loss for words to properly name it.",Hereditary

Just saw it. Total snooze! No jumps, no scary moments. Not at all original if you have seen the last Paranormal Activity and The Lords of Salem. The Insidious franchise movies are terrifying in comparison!!! And well.... they are not actually scary but at least engaging and hold your attention. While Toni Collette is brilliant (as always) the movie should have just been classified as a Drama/Very mild thriller. Director Eli Roth wrote a post yesterday about how scary it was... this made me even more excited to see the movie. Well... he MUST have been paid to write it. HIS movies like Hostel and The Green Inferno are way more ""scary""... again... not actually terrifying movies.
I usually don't write posts about the movies I watch but I was so dissatisfied and disappointed in Hereditary a warning to others was needed.
My score of 2 stars was for Toni Collette's acting only. The movie deserves less stars.",Hereditary
1794,the_zookeeper,"Naysayers might not be ""stupid,"" but they definitely missed the horror",9,22 August 2018,"I just read a review of this movie by user ""Madzima,"" in which he or she claims possible stupidity for missing the brilliance of ""Hereditary."" My answer to Madzima is this: you might not necessarily be stupid, but you did miss what so many others caught, and no, you cannot blame your missing the emotional, graphic terror on the director, the actors, or anyone other than yourself.""Hereditary"" is about the destruction of a family following the death of the matriarch's mother. It was sold as being seen through the eyes of the mother, Toni Collette, but this is bait-and-switch advertising, for the real heart-rending story in this movie is not about Mom, but about her son, played by Alex Wolff. I don't want to give away too much in this review. (Really, though, you can Google other reviews and find out what happens.) My goal is to tell you about the movie's tone and worth and--after reading how much Madzima hated it--to prepare you for how you should approach it.You should watch this movie not as a horror film at first at all. No. Don't do that. But do watch it in a dark room. Turn off all the lights. Unplug the phones. Turn off your cell. Turn up the volume. Then, as the characters unfold in front of you, pretend they are your friends, your neighbors... pretend they are your family. If you are a mom, love the kids. If you are a young adult, consider this is a weird family and go with it: don't be an uptight douche. If you are a father, husband, then try to ask yourself how attached or involved you are with your family.THIS is where the movie hits people. HERE. It's the connections that ""regular"" people should have to their familial members. You should love your mom. Your mom should love you. Your dad should be involved with your life. You should feel safe in your own home.If you watch closely, early on, you might ask yourself where the warmth is in this family. If you don't see the loss of such, then... no, you might not get the movie. It's this disintegration of warmth between all the members -- save for Charlie and her brother -- that hit me early on, and I came from a kind-of dysfunctional family myself.... but we were not... this.If you miss this point, then, no, you will miss the disintegration. It's important, too, because this loss of bonds is the real horror. A woman's standing outside the area at your school, where you eat lunch, and screaming that you are expelled without context, but no one else seems to hear her? Whatever. Within the context of the movie? Terrifying. Isolating. Beyond reality. THIS is what the movie brings to the table. It brings a slow burn, a spiraling into madness that take time.The real terror of this movie is familial. It's watching a mother abandon one child in favor of a dead one. It's watching a child realize he's going to die. It's watching a father give up because he never was alive to begin with. But most importantly, it's considering the title... Hereditary. It's considering that no matter what someone does, he or she is simply bound to repeat the past. No choice. No escape. When metered with demonic supernatural, it's an unbeatable concept.And if it all passed you by, Jesus. I feel badly for you. You missed some absolutely graphic horror.",Hereditary
1795,solitaryprincess,Dissapointing,5,19 September 2018,"I was so excited for this movie to release cause I love the trailer, I watched it a couples of times and showed it to my friends. Boy, turns out that the trailer is the best part of the movie. It's not really a bad movie, it had its moments (some scene were memorable and effective) but the overall story-line was all over the place. Unpredictability is usually a good thing but in this case it's like the movie itself doesn't understand where it's heading thus at the end it felt like there was no ""oh"" moment for the audience. It's like when you are having a really bad stomachache but instead of having a massive dump only small fragments of poops come out. Classic case of when a great trailer and high expectation killed a movie.",Hereditary
1796,mk1974,I'm not sure what so many critics liked about this,3,6 July 2018,"My taste in films is normally fairly well aligned with critics. I like mainstream movies and arthouse films, and when something appeals to both kinds of audiences, it's usually a pretty solid bet that I will like it. This movie, from its reviews, seemed to fit that bill. I came out of it, more than anything else, confused.The confusion didn't come from the plot of the movie, but from the sense that maybe I'd missed something. What was it about this film that made it stand out to people. Granted, Toni Collette is always good and she is here as well, and the cinematography/art direction was good. But the movie just isn't that good otherwise.First, there's the girl. The promo materials focus on her a lot, even though she's a rather secondary character in the film. I don't like it when people are presented as being creepy simply because they are strange or unusual. The girl was not creepy to me. She seemed like she was just autistic or something.Second, there is nothing scary about the movie. At all. While I give it credit for not resorting to jump scares, I just didn't find the atmosphere very scary. There was a lot of good emotional depth to it, especially Toni Collette's character, but it seemed like it was trying to be creepy and failing. The movie would have functioned way better as a drama about loss than it does as a horror film.Third, it had elements that it presented as twists that I thought were astoundingly obvious and that it telegraphed way too much. I don't want to spoil anything, so that's all I'll say about that.Fourth, I thought Gabriel Byrne was seriously miscast. I like him a lot as an actor, but he was too old for the role, seeming more like a grandfather than a father, and he lacked intensity and vigor that it seemed like his character should have had. It was distracting to me whenever he was in a scene.All in all, a disappointment.",Hereditary

I have temporarily blocked out the 2nd-scariest.
Hereditary is the third-scariest. Like Pet Sematary, there's an upsetting death of someone younger. 
As noted by another reviewer, the last ten minutes diffuse the tension--slightly--but not enough to remove the overall impact of the film.Ari Aster is a horror master and I will probably never see a horror film by him again. This film was psychologically upsetting without being excessively gory; Aster cares about his characters and, as such, knows how to torture them.All technical elements are standout, but Colin Stetson's score really gets under your skin.This movie gets nine stars out of ten.

1805,moviegeek80,Why all the hype?,5,18 June 2018,"I'm honestly not sure where all the hype came from surrounding this movie. I have been an avid horror fan for over 30 years now and seen most every horror movie out there, so I am a bit ""desensitized"" to what finds its way to the silver screen these days, and that being said, this movie falls short for me. The film's pacing was slow to begin, with a more ""hurry up and let's get to the good stuff"" kind of vibe with the first hour being something similar to sitting in a doctor's office waiting, so don't be in a hurry when watching this film. Secondly, the acting was on point fro the exception of a couple scenes involving the son and his whining; seemed a bit fake to me. Thirdly, I am a stickler for lighting; it was very well done masking just what needed to be masked and nothing else giving the scenery and backdrops an eerie feel of course. The movie does have a couple ""PG-13 horror, cheap jump scares"", which for me ruin a good horror film. Gore was present and very well done with use of both CGI and practical effects. Overall the film was OK. As the credits rolled, I turned to my wife (who is terrified by horror films and rarely watches them for that reason) and said ""honey, what did you think?"", she replied ""was that it?....it really wasn't that scary."" So, there you have it. Don't take the kids as there is full nudity of the likes that's similar to what you may find in Game of Thrones, and the obvious medium-level gore, but I think my wife's response was spot-on....""was that it?"" Go see it for yourself and be the judge. If you are a huge horror fan, you make like it, but I don't think it has any rewatchability.",Hereditary

Basically is this, you watch the movie and you're like: What the hell happened i think i didn't got it all. Then you google search what happened: Oh thats it, most of the scenes make a lot more sense now. You may even need to watch the movie a second time to really get it.

1811,anng-23,How do I say I loved this film without sounding deranged...?,10,21 October 2019,"I have nothing but love for Ari Astor. I saw this film before Midsommar was released, and read Ari's brief discriptions of the themes for the two films only after watching the latter. Hereditary is discribed as being a 'family drama', where Midsommar is discribed as a film about a 'break-up' . And nothing could be more accurate in both cases...and THEN some!As with Midsommar, I read a lot of  reviews slating this film as garbage. As with Midsommar, I can't help but feel a bit of pity for those who saw this film, and neither understood nor appreciated it for the true, deep-seated terror it can conjure.Although I am a huge fan of the traditional jump-scare and gore horror genre, I am pleased to come across films like this, in that the slow, atmospheric story telling brings to mind films like Rosemary's Baby with an extra helping of melancholy and hopeless dispair.And the fact that the true horror does not necessarily lie in the supernatural (which there is a sufficient degree of), but in the roots it holds in reality and the issues humanity deal with in the real world. That is, for better or worse, where true horror lives; it comes from within us, more than without.I never felt the need to register for membership until now, after having seen this film and Midsommar. I felt obligated to join in order to weigh in on these films; these are under-appreciated masterpieces, deserving of a better, more emotionally intelligent audience to judge it than some of the one-dimensional minds that could not appreciate it for what it is worth.An amazing director; an amazing cast, both of whom fully succeeded in conveying the story being told and leave you reeling for months.",Hereditary

I've heard so many positive reviews and I thought it looked great from the first trailer but all I got was disappointment.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I definitely don't feel like I wasted those 2+ hours. The acting was great, the story was engaging enough and it definitely tugged on my heartstrings at moments but it was so predictable.
First act was a good build-up. It got me engaged and interested. Second act was the best part of the entire movie and it made me think maybe this could become my new favorite movie. I also got the feeling that this might be that kinda horror that just sticks with me and gets me paranoid for a week afterwards(which I love) but then as the second act moved to a close and the third came in, I got bored. It became predictable. Some of the effects were great but it didn't hit the way it should've because I'd already called it. I found myself counting down to the ""jump scares"" (that weren't jump scares in the classic sense so kudos for that but still just as predictable) and just waiting for the end, which was very anticlimactic.
It's a solid movie but it definitely won't stick with me in any way, shape or form and that's a shame. A real shame.",Hereditary
1816,gilsentme,"Good set up, slightly silly denouement",8,15 March 2020,"Hereditary demonstrates considerable skill in how it sets up an unsettling tale about a family enduring a devastating loss and what dark forces may be behind this. The family members are presented as idiosyncratic, representing different perspectives, but all of whom are sympathetic in their own ways and not yielding to simple stereotypes. The difficulties behind the events in their lives unfold slowly and eerily, director Ari Aster pacing the film expertly.

It's a plotless boring watch for 90 minutes where hardly anything happens and then it kinda turns a bit in to a horror movie for the last part but the plot was no where to be found before so it didn't do anything to make the movie better or more scary,it made it even more dumb and pointless.
Some reviewers will tell you that it's about loss and greef and mental illness,and thats not true at all for me because the end part of the movie troughs all of that nonsense out of the window with the lacklustering plot reveal.
Just because they mixed a bit of anything in with out any direction to follow you can pick almost anything as what it was about...Maybe it was about miniture models in tiny houses and that would be just as good of an argument for what it was about.

1828,lc_1996,Not perfect but a breath of fresh air,8,28 April 2019,"Wow. What an impressive directorial debut from Ari Aster. I had no notion of where the film was going for at least the first half and it kept my attention throughout, even though the pacing is much slower than a typical horror film. As a side note, I wouldn't consider this as a horror film but, rather, a thriller because I barely found it scary. I don't consider this a criticism, just something to bear in mind.The real joy of this film is connecting the dots after the big reveal and there's so much hidden throughout the film to keep one entertained during the second watch. I don't want to come off as elitist, but it seems clear from some criticisms that many people genuinely don't understand what happened in this film, whether because it was too subtle or they weren't paying attention. This is a shame because I'd like to encourage films that don't pander to inattentive audiences. I found the reveal to be a bit heavy-handed but that clearly wasn't enough for those people. I hope these reviews will be ignored and films will continue to be made that aren't caste from the same old, wornout, Hollywood mould. I'm not saying people are wrong to dislike this film but that some people are verifiably wrong in some specific criticisms.Tony Collette's performance was, as usual, transcending. I've seen some claim she was 'overacting' but, honestly, how would you expect her character to act in her extreme circumstance and history of mental illness (another detail subtly revealed in the film)? I suppose she should've been chilling out with a cup of tea? The supporting actors were also very capable, except for Alex Wolff. He can pull off the pothead son with ease and even act sad and afraid, but his heaving sobs sounded ridiculous.Only one plot point irked me, which (without giving anything away) involved a bizarre decision Annie made as a mother regarding her daughter. My only other criticism is the CG flies, which looked abysmal and completely ruined my immersion in the film. They looked like amorphous black blobs, some of which seemed to be crawling over the camera lens. I guess it comes with the low budget, but I'd like to see them remastered. Some other effects were also behind the times, but the flies were the worst offenders.I'm looking forward to Aster's next feature film. Ignore the haters and give it a watch.",Hereditary

Collette a great performance as usual; Byrne, didn't do much but at least seemed like he *wasn't* ""phoning it in""; and, somewhat surprisingly Wolff a splendid job as the scared, panicked, and guilty teenager.The start of the film gets going and we're already on a note of sadness and grief, starting with the funeral of Annie's mother and her daughter Charlie's clear struggles with it. Then it gets worse as Charlie dies in a tragic accident, while in the care of her brother. The despair of the family grows but the plot of the movie then devolves into trash...So here we go, on to the laughable and nonsensical plot that continues, which isn't even remotely ""scary"". Scary for kids perhaps, sure, but not grown adults. Seances, some contrived horse do-do about ""Paimon"" and pagans and evil worship, and other hilarious stuff like that. Really? Gimme a break.

1835,aragonyao,Totally overrated,1,7 August 2018,"Every cliche American horror film must have a husband who never believes his wife. So does Hereditary. Why is it so difficult for Steve just to throw the book in the stove!? The beggining of the film is extremely slow that people fell asleep during the screening. Throughout the whole film, nobody has even been surprised by any shot or plot. The mom overacted too much. The 'screaming acting' style. The build up of the little girl didn't lead to anything deeper rather than a few drawing on the stretch book and the sound. I went to watch because of the 7.6 rating but extremely disappointed. It lacks strength, development, deeper love (now floating on the surface), structure. I wish they played conjuring and I would enjoy watching it for a third time.",Hereditary

The acticing is top notch. Toni Collette shines in this as does Milly Shapiro. It's an acting Tour de Force It is a wonderfully pieced together story with mind shattering moments, leaving one with an eternal sense of foreboding. IMDB closed its message boards a while back, which was a good thing. It finally managed to rid itself of the anonymous little trolls. I now firmly believe that the average IMDB commenter, should have to expose themselves prior to being allowed to review a title...

This movie starting slow and seeming more like a drama roped me into the characters so as it went on the events that transpired took a toll on me. The acting was the best acting I've seen in a horror film and had me truly invested into something I wish I could just walk away from, but couldn't. This was in fact the most stressful and psychologically damaging movie I've ever experienced and I don't think I would want to watch this again unless my family wanted to because I would want to see how they would react to it.",Hereditary

Idk what was my impression on both two moments back then, but today, on 2021 I accidentaly watched it again on fox mov, from the moment his sister was dead until the rest of the horror happenings in this house (i didn't watch it from the beginning today), I realized nobody has ever done it like Hereditary. No film or series. No one. Just none. Its originality, its horrifying truth, the character building, its graphics and vulgarity throughout the scenes, just left me nothing but nightmare tonight.Might be other side effects after watched the Midsommar, too, last year?

1840,angieortiz-ri,"Not bad because it was not good, but because it is unnecessarily scarring and traumatic",1,29 June 2018,"This is probably the most traumatizing movie I've ever experienced in my entire existence. I'll just start with this, by the end of the movie, no one in the theatre clapped. That says a lot right off the bat. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, I watch them all the time, I love the thrill of feeling scared. Most of you reading this can probably relate to that. Well this movie did not do that for me. This movie rips apart the layers of your soul and faith in all things good in the world. I don't mean to sound heartless when I say this, but this movie doesn't make you want to clap at the end, it makes you want to off yourself. You'll wish you never stepped into the theatre to watch this. From the beginning of the movie, things were almost a bit comical. I actually found myself laughing so hard I had to step out of the theatre to take a breather for a moment. Boy, do I regret returning. When I came back into the theatre and sat and watched the rest, I never found myself laughing again. I wanted to scream and cry and I couldn't even bring myself to walk out and just leave because you feel glued to the screen like if you look away the things you've seen will stay with you anyways and haunt you there. When I say this movie terrified me, I feel like the writers and directors are sitting back and feeling proud that they accomplished their goal they had set for their audience. Well I wish I could meet those people and punch them in the face. This movie is not a horror, this is a dramatic reading straight out of an anti-bible written by the devil. And I mean that sincerely. This movie will make you make you stay awake all night, not because you're ""scared"" but because you're disgusted at the way this movie made you feel. 
I could go on and on saying these things but I will say one last thing: if you're reading this and think ""this sounds interesting I'd like to see it for myself."" My response would be don't spend your money on it and watch it in a public theatre. Wait for it to come out on cable or on DVD and watch it in the comfort of your own home, away from anyone with inncocence in them, even if you're 18, I still recommend this movie for much older adults. This is not for the faint of heart and especially not for that of mind.",Hereditary

1843,burgerbrogaming,One of the best horror films of this generation.,10,20 January 2019,"I watched this film a few days ago not expecting much about it. I saw no trailers before hand, of coarse I heard the film was good from friends and the internet. So going into it I was expecting just a B grade excorist clone. But what I got was something far more special. This film truly is terrific from the excellent cinematography and story direction. Every time I thought the film was going a cliche direction it spun in a completely different way and left my jaw on the floor. Just when you think you have seen the worst or have figured it all out the film proves you desperately wrong. I cant and won't talk to much about the plot due to spoilers but just know it is one of the most unique and well crafted stories in horror history. Now onto the performances, Tony Collette and Alex Wolff give stellar dark performances that set the tone in the right moments even the girl Milly Shapiro does an excellent job at her role. The score for this film is also incredible and I think everybody should give it a listen even if you never see the movie. The biggest negative I have with the film is the ending which isn't necessarily bad but also leaves no room for interpretation for the viewer whilst the entire film did until this point. This was a huge disappointment for me simply because I feel the conversation of this film could have been more deep then it was. Other than that though this film was terrific and one of the modern horror jewels that needs to be experienced by everyone",Hereditary

This has to be one of the dullest, most tedious and disappointing movies I've seen for a long while. The trailer is definitely misleading, giving you false hope of a good old eerie, even psychological horror, not the bizarre freakshow it turns into. The first part of the movie moves at such a slow pace, it's hard to keep awake and when it does finally kick in it goes so far over the top it becomes embarrassing. Toni Collette, normally reliable, is so garishly OTT you have to watch her through your fingers, it's such a cringeworthy performance, and Gabriel Byrne is frankly wasted and he just looks like he wishes he hadn't signed up for it in the first place. I'm not sure how on earth this ridiculous piece of work is being compared to full on classics such as The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby, there's just no comparison. The end of the movie couldn't come soon enough - an utter farce. Save your time and well earned money - I wish I had.",Hereditary

While I was terrifired the first time I watched this film. I did not have a firm grasp on the entire plot. It took another watch. This film is extremely terrifying. I am a horror fanatic and I am never scared...till this movie came along. These are not cheap predictable jump scares or a gory blood fest like 99% of the horrors that are out there.

In the subsequent weeks I found myself talking about it often with friends who had seen it, revisiting the most memorable moments and finding myself disturbed all over again. The plot is absurd and if you read a synopsis you'd assume this was a hokey mess, but the characters and their relationships are so grounded in reality (anchored by Toni Collette and Alex Wolff's remarkable performances) that when the worst happens your empathy overpowers your incredulity and you're sucked in.

No jump scares, more of a slow burning psychological horror albeit a little too slow paced at times, with a good twist. But, as in most modern horror movies, the director seems to run out of ideas of how to end the movie! The ending is certainly underwhelming to say the least. A solid 7 for me - Overall very well acted and good direction for the most but a few unnecessary ""arty"" camera shots do nothing for the movie, Well worth watching but don't expect to be blown away.

1858,craigfs-17680,Attractively filmed Garbage,2,18 June 2018,"I felt strongly enough about this presentation to write a review and perhaps 
flag a few pointers that may help people decide whether to pay out money
to see this or not. I love a great supernatural story, well told and effectively 
put across on screen. Starting at the beginning there is a promising opening 
scene after the death of the Grandmother. It is poignant and eerie and Toni Collette is unnerving and strange in her potrayal as the not quite grieving Daughter.To give this film it's stripes it does handle creepy and atmospheric scene's well however it's downfall comes when it attempts anything except slow, crawling panning shots, and it is shot VERY slowly. You can almost hear the camera creaking as it moves seemingly forever down a corridor or across treetops, or through a window, or around a spooky room. So the strength of this movie lies in it's atmosphere and it's weakness lies in any attempt to make an interesting or coherent story. As it progresses, after an insufferably long period of time ( I like a story set-up but seriously? ) the performances become more hysteria than reallistic,and the plot ( Yes there is one!!? ) goes uncontrollably off road and hits a symbollic lamp-post. Perhaps if they had stuck to the more ambiguous mental health aspect of Collette's character rather than leaning to the more obvious plot thread it might have made for a more intriguing story.
As for high points, the daughter's performance is unsettling and her story arc
goes to a place I don't think anyone would expect... It is attractively filmed
with all the right technical stuff going on.The advertising has been sinfully 
misleading, clever but misleading and many people will leave the theatre
disappointed and perhaps a bit confused. There were about eight people
in the Sunday night screening I attended and NO-ONE enjoyed it.
As a final point which may come across as sarcastic, it has been compared 
to "" The Witch "" in a number of reviews. Bull-crap. The Witch was a masterfully 
handled psychological horror piece and this IMO garbage is not. If you were thrilled and delighted by the theatrical event that was "" Mother "" then you may well enjoy this. For the majority of us who enjoy our movies with hype they can 
comfortably live up to it will doubtless be forgotten and put down to being
a bad dream. A beautifully shot, ridiculous and non-sensical bad dream. 
And if you want ridiculous then prepare yourself for the last fifteen minutes.
For a "" Horror "" movie it's very funny. I'm not sure if that was it's intention.",Hereditary

In addition you always feel like something is going to happen in every scene change. The tense is so vibrant that makes you feel like there is something in your stomach all the time and the raw scenes which contains helps it even more. Now on the acting part.Gabriel Byrne is wonderful as always,shapiro is also exquisite even though she didn't have a big part but the real star is toni collete with her performance as woman that might suffers from a mental illness real misleads and twists the plot till the very end of the film.Her performance makes you feel discomfort,frightened and I'd also say sick because of how realistic it is. I've seen countless horror films something which have make me immune against jump scares and these kind of things.
Hereditary is a film that I've been waiting a long time for its release and it worth it,every minute of it.
The reviews I red where either height or depth but trust me it's a movie that you should see it's not an alternative,deep meaning,aronofsky style film.

If you are sensitive to horror, jumpscares and are terrifyied easily, dont watch it! Its really stressing. I remember me and my friend not talking to each other for a few minutes after we finished watching it. It is a really good, and innovative movie, dont get me wrong.

1872,simhill,Hypnotic.,7,2 July 2018,"Horror and comedy have one undeniable connection. They are the most subjective genrs. When you go into a horror film there is always going to be the chance that the scares won't get to you. But for a movie like this, it's worth the chance if not just to see some very creative cinematography and meaningful shot composition. A lot of thought has been woven into each frame in order to help you piece the puzzle together...or misdirect you.The plot is simple, and the characters are real enough but not very complex, but they don't have to be. Many horror writers have proven that a good way to throw the audience off is to abandon the three act structure and drive the story with an intriguing idea or theme, that the plot and characters simply frame. Hereditary is a great example of this. Pacing issues have been the most prevalent criticism, but I don't think it's too serious. It wouldn't hurt to cut a few minutes, especially in the middle, however I didn't think it was dragging. It's a movie worth being patient for.You really should see this spoiler free, which means there's only so much detail I can give, so I'll sum it up here.

But it was so hyped up as scarier than Midsommar (which I've just seen in theatres and really enjoyed), and it was available on Netflix, so I decided to give it a shot.The acting was pretty good and the characters were fairly interesting, which is the only reason it's even getting 3 stars. The plot was incredibly bland and predictable, even leaving out the paranormal stuff. I found absolutely no part of this film to be even mildly scary. I had trouble to focus at parts, and at no point did I feel immersed in what was happening. There was also very, very little significant character development for anyone, which I found disappointing as some of the characters had potential to be very engaging.

Every day is Halloween for me. My bedroom is full of giant Halloween props and decorations that people are terrified of. People constantly ask me how I even sleep at night. I constantly surround myself with all things dark and creepy because its what I enjoy. I even make horror films myself. I'm also 15 years old. Now, with that in mind, please note I do not get scared easily because scary things to me are like family. Yet, this movie had my heart racing. Before you watch the movie, do not see the trailer. I watched the trailer and couldn't stop laughing because I thought it looked so bad. It actually became a joke at my house we would go on and on about and make clicking noises everyday. My original intention to see the movie was to see how bad it would be, because the trailer looks so stupid. But, after seeing the movie, I'm actually really glad that I went. This is probably the scariest modern day movie. Now, I wouldn't listen to the critics who say it is the modern day equivalent to The Exorcist. No horror movie out there can ever top The Exorcist. However, this movie is frightening. If you have seen the trailer, when you go in to see the movie, disregard anything you saw on the trailer, because this movie is much more than it appears. It doesn't use jumpscares at all, which is great, because this movie actually uses real fear. It makes you scared by wondering what will happen next, and if it can get any worse than it already is for the family. It draws you in to the point you don't want to stop staring at the screen. My only complaint about the movie is the ending scene. I think if they would have done the scene properly it would have worked, but the way that it was narrated and portrayed takes away from it. There is one part of the last scene that is really scary, and if you see the movie, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about. This movie is full of suspense and mystery that keeps drags you in and keeps you staring at the screen because the real secrets to the movie aren't revealed until about 15 minutes from the end. The rest of the movie doesn't really have any hints at all to what's going on, which just leaves you in confusion, which is what you want from a horror movie.",Hereditary

1882,ismaelhernandez-95926,Won't watch it twice,8,7 October 2019,"As a fan of horror films I was a little hesitant upon the release of Ari Asters film Hereditary. Therefore I barely decided to see it a couple days ago to get myself in the Halloween season mood. I do not understand all the negative reviews this movie has received but I do understand that what scares some people, to others it doesn't. Some people love the blood/guts/jumpscares while im a real big fan of the slow burners which is most peoples condemnation for this film is that it moves too slow. I think the pacing was near perfect, the music and sounds added an extra sense of impending doom. The acting was perfect (besides Nate's Wolf very annoying cry like if he was a 5 year old) the visuals were what disturbed me the most. The fly's and ants on Charlie's head after being beheaded juxtaposed with Toni Colletes screaming and cryin of pain from losing her only daughter. The Latin words/symbols that are written on walls and even the pole that beheaded young Charlie even Ari Asters confirmed that those are actual cult symbols. Paimon is a real demon (if you believe in that) for people who practice black magic really do pray too. Did I find the film particularly terrifying? No. Did I find it ultimately disturbing? Yes! You get to see the family dynamic change throughout the course of the film, Ari Aster forces you to get attached to the characters on screen. You feel fear, hopelessness and a slew of other emotions throughout the films progression. Which to me is what made this film so great, I won't speak for everyone because my opinion differs from others. I will say if your a fan of slow burning movies with a storyline and incredible acting then I would highly recommend watching this film. I watched it with my brother and when it was over we both said to each other we will never watch it again. Not because it was bad but because even after it was over that sense of dread lingered within us for a very good amount of days.",Hereditary
1883,chriskeizur,Captivating take on grief,10,23 June 2018,"During the inciting incident in ""Hereditary"" (no spoilers, but anyone who has seen the film will know what I am talking about) I drooled on myself. I was so captivated and stunned by what I was seeing, that my jaw literally dropped. Ari Aster's debut feature length film gets its hooks into you early, and keeps you engrossed throughout. It's a moody flick, that follows some of the tried and true practices of horror-greats without ever feeling like a retread. In fact, if you are looking for a popcorn scary movie that will have you shouting with fright at jump scares and gratuitous gore, then stay away. But nonetheless those patient enough will find this movie will have you squirming in your seat. The cinematography is inventive, with lots of dynamic shots and clever incorporation of the main character's profession of designing dioramas. At times, it becomes difficult to tell if what you are looking at is real or not - something the characters struggle with themselves. And the acting is a shining triumph in this film, and one that should be recognized come award season. Gabriel Byrne and Milly Shapiro are both delightful, with the later shaking off the narrative that child actors can bring a performance down, while Alex Wolff does a decent job (despite some strange crying). But the standout star is Toni Collette, who portrays the mother Annie. She is so visceral in this movie, and whenever she is on set the film elevates into a whole other level. Her performance during a scene around the dinner table is one of the best moments in acting I have ever watched. ""Hereditary"" is a strong movie that continues the recent trend of horror films breaking into prestige territory - much to my chagrin, a self-professed coward. It shows how grief can seep into a home and infect and warp those touched by it.",Hereditary

To the point where I had a lucid dream and was woken screaming.Be prepared for a strange ending but take it literally, it's not pretentious at all really it's very literal in terms of meaning if you pick up the clues along the way, just very strange but be open to it as it's very intense, immersive, haunting and just fantastic.",Hereditary

However, as the ending unraveled, I felt disappointed that it was ancient demons instead of mental illness. While this is a horror film and supernatural occurences were expected, I would have appreciated more a 'scientific' explanation of the events. It was a good film, but in my view it would have been more terrifying if Ellen and Annie and Peter would have suffered from schizophrenia rather than being possessed by evil spirits. Disturbing and enjoyable nonetheless.",Hereditary

1887,maximusthemerciful,Mediocre Thriller Overhyped by the Critics,6,11 June 2018,"This is a solid entry level thriller by Ari Aster with tasteful nods to the quintessentials such as Rosemary's Baby and The Shining.The story opens with Mom (Toni Collette), Dad (Gabriel Byrne), high school son (Alex Wolff), and 13-year-old daughter (Milly Chapiro) dealing with the death of Mom's mother, a domineering woman with a penchant for spellbooks whose absence is generally not missed. After a tragedy befalls this family, supernatural chaos ensues, mostly inside the family home, which of course is in an isolated wooded location.The problem is that it's too slow of a burn, as Aster takes 80% of the movie to build up the suspense and then fails to deliver the anticipated thrills, shock, and awe in the last 20%. Very similar pacing and cliche haunted house tropes (doors opening and closing, candles blowing out, seances, etc.) as the awful Paranormal Activity series.The gem of this film is unquestionably Collette. Her performance of a woman who transitions from anxious grieving daughter, to frenzied matriarch, to utter hysterical terror by the end of the movie, would be the only reason I would ever watch this again (but probably won't). A dinner scene where she releases 16 years of pent up verbal rage upon her family (and the way Wolff's character internalizes the painful things she says) is, admittedly, a very well shot and executed 5 minutes of cinema. Sadly, that's where the good ends. The movie's score is nearly nonexistent and overdoes it with the moments of drawn out silence. Byne is wasted in this film as the secular skeptic, detached father who witnesses the supernatural phenomena firsthand, yet still refuses to believe his wife's assertions that some kind of apparitions are pursuing them with malcontent (due to her convenient history of mental illness). It's also not believable in the slightest how Wolff's character processes the tragedy, receives no therapy whatsoever after the tragedy occurs, or that any of the family members being victimized in the home never think to leave the home.Giving this movie an R rating was a stretch. Giving it a 93% RT rating was an unforgivable overhype. Watch it once for Collette's performance and move on.",Hereditary

The general audience will most likely find both ""too slow"", ""too boring"", but if you are tired of obnoxious jumpscare filled movies, this is a really refreshing movie.Pretty much every detail regarding filmmaking: the cinematography, pacing, camera movement, editing and especially acting - is flawless. It's a big rollercoaster of emotions.This movie seems to turn down a lot of people. Many speculate that it is because they are used to the cliched horror flicks that are coming out now, however people noticed a few unintentionally comedic cuts/scenes and in the theater, I heard laughter once - which might be the case. It's quite the shame because I can't remember the last time I was this frightened by a movie.Make sure to see this movie blind.

Director Ari Aster previously disturbed audiances with ""The Strange Thing About the Johnsons"", while i have never seen it i'll take people's word that it's freaky as hell. But Aster here knows how to make great horror that digs deep into the audiance, most importantly it combines two horrors: the horrors of family relationships and he horror of the supernatural, combining these two things creates a unsettling, dreadful, intenseas you watch this family slow rip each other to shreds , can't recommend this movie enough, one of the best of 2018, one of the best horrors ever, AND IT SHOULD'VE BEEN NOMINATED FOR SOME OSCARS THIS YEAR!

Not worth the hype.,Hereditary
1892,leantom-95768,Rosemary's Baby on Steroids,7,25 June 2018,"In terms of the pacing, it's more Rosemary's Baby and less The Exorcist. By that, I mean that the movie is primarily a mystery until the last 10-15 minutes, when the true terrors and horrific sequences begin. In fact, I would classify this film as primarily a mystery with a few sequences of horror.As for the review, here goes:The story begins with the death of a family's elderly matriarch. From the opening clips, we're led to believe that the relationship between the matriarch and her daughter, Toni Collette, was rather cold and stressful, with the latter showing very little distress at the former's passing. However, we're also led to believe that the recently deceased as somewhat mysterious, as she made odd requests in life such as wanting her daughter to have a son and wanting to raise her daughter's progeny herself. As the story builds, we're given more and more clues - some more overt than others - regarding the true nature of Ms. Collette's character's mother. Apparently, she was part of some sort of cult, and it begins to appear that she was trying to set something in motion before her death that would have drastic consequences for her family. And boy, was she ever planning something.Without revealing too much, suffice it to say that her family eventually winds up sacrificing...a lot....and the design is quite sinister.The script is fairly intelligent; the family seems very ""real,"" and the scenes of emotional pain don't appear overly histrionic. The plot comes together very well at the climax of the film, and you feel somewhat relieved at the end despite a horrifying conclusion.Again, the movie has a good script, good acting, and interesting plot. Go see it.",Hereditary

1921,aristos84,Worthy of Being Imitated,9,12 January 2019,"Hereditary is a supernatural horror movie that is about demon invocations and secret satan societies. But these come towards the end. Before that the movie weaves its plot in a mist of mystery and unexplained incidences. Almost from the beginning odd moments take place which soon become bizarre and then uncanny. The general atmosphere resembles that of Rosemary's baby in the sense that satanists are taking control of the lives of normal and unaware people. And they stay unaware when the little daughter of the family of protagonists dies in a dreadful accident. We as audience don't know what to make out of it but we get an undefined sense of imminent threat relatively early in the movie.
The movie revolves around a four members family and especially the mother Annie. Mystery grows better when feelings are contained and the director is careful to keep them suppressed, in the first half of the movie at least. The family although not disharmonic it has still some conflicts and some unresolved issues. They are not detached with each other but not warm either. The loss of the daughter makes them more humane and it lights up some hidden emotions which helps the development of the characters, although it doesn't bring them closer.
In the second half of the movie things start to escalate when Annie meets Joan who introduces her in the spiritualist practices of mediums. Later we find out that Joan has intentionally intruded in Annie's life by pretending a mother who lost her son so that she can earn her trust. What she really wants is to trick Annie to conduct a malevolent rite, leaving her thinking that she invokes the spirit of her lost daughter. But instead of that, she summons a demon that seeks incarnation in the body of her son Peter. Joan is doing her part and using black magic attempts to choke Peter to death and later lead him to self-infliction, with both attempts failing. Finally the demon possess the body of Annie who tries to kill Peter herself, something that happens after Peter jumps out of the attic window, scared from what he found there.
Toni Collette as Annie, builds a very convincing character. She wants her relations with her children to make sense but she miss the way. She wants to express her feelings but her family is the last place she seeks. These deadlocks, and the inept way she tries to get over them, adds to the her tragic figure. The contractions of her face accompany perfectly her emotional bursts and her frantic terror. Amongst the highlights of the movie is the possessed Annie flying around the house. The death of the husband, after his body blaze up when Annie throw the possessed notebook in the fire leaves you staggered. The hideous smiles of the naked people in the house and the moment that Annie discovers her mother's corpse in the attic are chilling. Hereditary is a great horror movie worthy of being imitated in terms of atmosphere and escalation.",Hereditary
1922,canklesandcookies,Heads Will Roll,10,29 January 2019,"Aster literally turns the horror genre ""on its head"" with Hereditary. The intricately woven plot, the stunning visual and visceral body elements, and sublime performances (Collete especially heartbreaking and real) all add up to the best horror/dysfunctional-family drama/mystery of the year. On top of all that, Aster crafts what is possibly the most disturbing image caught on film in the last decade or so (and not because of gore or anything like that) - without spoiling, the way he creates this rising tension with the car scene, when it finally culminates, we don't even see the gruesome image - it's all told through Wolfe's eyes and the eerily tranquil silence of the aftermath.

I was honestly kind of disturbed by this movie and couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks! Most of the people I know who didn't like this movie are the same kind who thought the insidious movies were scary. If you're one of those than this may not be for you . I truly think this movie is a masterpiece and wish more movies like this would come out!,Hereditary

With a great cast, beautiful cinematography, and wonderfully created horror that has zero to none of those cheap jumpscares, you WILL be hooked from the first ten minutes.

For all of the uninspired copy past possession movies that have come out in the last ten years, this really felt like a breath of fresh air.

Unfortunately, none was spent during the writing of it. The storyline is, in lack of a better word, boring. Just plain awful. The movie is not scary. I wouldn't even consider it a horror film. There is some constant tension going on, which mostly manifests in a close-up of the character slowly turning back towards the camera, with rising violins playing in the soundtrack. And then... nothing happens. This repeats a number of times throughout the film. I was hoping for the first few times that this cinematic device was used that it would go somewhere.

Years ago I took an interest in Aleister Crowley, and did quite a bit of research on him, more recently I watched a film called A Dark Song, which prompted even more research.

As far from a masterpiece as possible.,3,11 June 2018,"Probably the worst movie-going experience of 2018 for me and I pretty much see all the releases week to week.....yes.....even worse than Fifty Shades of Nothing. Even that was more terrifying.The first 40% of the film is dedicated to showing nothing in particular, backed by a horror genre standard screechy, whiny score that tries to inject some tension into the film's bland characters doing absolutely nothing. The problem with this movie for me is that it spends over two hours telling a story that goes nowhere, character arcs that develop nowhere and ultimately throwing in a mystical twist that borders on ridiculous. Performances were over the top, comically overdone especially Toni Collett and Alex Wolff. Put it this way, if you are a God fearing Christian and even the mere mention of the devil will send you sprinting for the confession box, then this movie will probably terrify you. For the rest of us, if 40 minutes of nothing followed by the mention of a 'seance' then characters sitting at tables reacting to moving cups sounds as bad, Hereditary manages to be even worse.",Hereditary

How can someone like this movie seriously unless they are 8 years old.There is no twist. There is nothing to make you scared. Nothing intriguing other than wondering how bad it can get. Trust me it exceeded my expectations on that. The only good scene was the accident and I genuinely thought that the movie was gonna be great right that moment where he was sitting on the wheel. Such a shame I was wrong. Why is it difficult to make a good movie? Why always go for supernatural stuff when you can easily freeze people's blood with real things? After all that if it turned out that she has a mental problem because of her mom and unwanted pregnancy it could have been a much better movie.Toni Collette was quite good as usual.

Decent acting from most characters. Decent sound track which might create some tension. CONS
Terrible writing overall. Movie build up was useless as to little of it anchors into explaining the story. Like someone already mentioned, actions and scenes are laughable, I was one of the laughing people at how bad parts of the story and scenes were.Since the little explanations don't create the idea the creepy things that happen could be real, it's hard to get scared by those unbelievable creepy things.In short it's hard to grasp what is going on during the movie. Bad story, bad explaining, long and dragging on way too long, bad character creation (not the fault of acting).

(Gabriel Byrne is a little understated but works as a sort of 'straight man' amidst the insane.Which brings me to SPOILERS:The film is visually impressive and almost painfully (in a good way) deliberate in its pacing until, eventually the supernatural bits overtake the much deeper family melodrama. The ending feels too conventional and also strangely tracked on; a final explanation even comes in voiceover that may very well have been ADR-ed after test audiences were confused.It's strange-I loved this film until somewhere in the third act when it turned too far away from the grounded place it has built for itself.

Every single one of the ""jump"" moments in this movie was well deserved-the drama and suspense was built up perfectly to create truly shocking moments. Another aspect of this film was the horror of the complicated family dynamics. If you aren't truly terrified by some of the things depicted in the movie, especially with Toni Collette's and Alex Wolff's amazing performances, then maybe you're not a parent.

1986,jamesdwayland49,"Good Ingredients, Lousy Recipe",3,13 June 2018,"If you could concoct a neat little formula that required ten parts to engineer a horror film that rated a perfect 10, Hereditary has seven or eight of those parts. And I give it a 3.
Look, there is a wealth of atmosphere. At times, the movie has tremendous impact. We experience this in the form of a potent sinister mood, a gut-wrenching emotional journey, and a palpable sense of mounting dread. There are some great performances in the mix, and at times the script is as inspired as the stellar direction. The score is magnificent throughout, standing as Hereditary's greatest strength. 
So where did this critical darling go wrong? Well, that's a long list too. First off, the pacing is a tremendous flaw. I don't mind a slow burn or a methodical pace in general, but this one fell asleep at the wheel far too often. It would settle into a groove and then drift away. It would find it's center again and then it would lose focus. It came and went, and I found myself checking ng my watch way too much. It was a bit maddening. It was also dreadfully predictable. The overall trajectory of the picture is obvious from the start, and the filmmakers seem to think they're pulling the rug out from under our feet long after everyone in thevaudience has a firm understanding if what is unfolding. While many of the performances are top-notch, many are uneven at best. That script containing jolts of inspiration is also loaded with bad beats and far too many boneheaded decisions. Your average slasher flick boasts smarter characters. Finally, while there are some serious scares in Hereditary, many of the movie's attempts to frighten us fall embarrassingly short. During the woeful climax, the audience I viewed this one with spent far more time howling with laughter than they did gasping.
Hereditary arrives with a wealth of potential and masterful direction, but in the end it can only slink away in shame. It opens with illusions of grandeur and slowly (very slowly) descends into a befuddled mess with a disastrous conclusion that feels a bit like a Monty Python sketch targeting Rosemary's Baby might have.",Hereditary
1987,saltyman5000,Don't watch this abomination!,1,16 June 2018,"Dull, boring, non scary piece of trash. It's a film that doesn't understand what it's point is. I was sat in the cinema, believing the hype and was ready to be terrified of the movie deemed as 'scary as the exorcist'. Lol The film starts with the death of the protagonists mother, who lived in with the rest of her family; her husband, eldest son and daughter. We observe how the family copes with the passing and how they all don't really feel anything for her. We then get sucked into how the grandma lived a peculiar life, only to be pulled straight back into the non grief that the family are experiencing. Another death occurs, more grief, more family blame and emotional break downs for 1 hour 40 minutes to be precise. Then the movie takes a dark turn when the mother believes she is a medium and summons one of the family members back through a seance. The summoned family member then chooses a host and begins to terrorise the family in order to carry out the passing grand mother's grand scheme, which was to summon a demon called, who gives a sh**. The ending is so underwhelming and unscary that the entire cinema laughed. I was very close to walking out, but had to stay just to see how this monstrosity of a film came to it's non conclusion. We witness grief and then non grief. More grief and then it turns into a family drama. Then for the remaining 15 minutes it attempts to be a horror film, which is about as scary as finding faeces in Your white briefs. Do not watch this film, save your money boys and girls.",Hereditary
1988,lewishalket,Overrated & Overhyped!,5,8 January 2019,"I was really expecting more from this movie, especially with all the hype. I watched till the end but drifted off about 5 times towards the end and had to skip it back but I hadn't missed anything really.The acting is great which makes up for a lot.A few details that bothered me about this movie:The family - they didn't seem like they were a family to me. I thought the older male was the leads father to begin with, not her husband.
The son looked like he was adopted (part of the story tells you he's definitely not adopted), as he looks completely different from his mother and sister which just brought the authenticity feel factor down a few notches.The lack of empathy from the characters, are families really that cold - I felt the family were off with each other from the very start.The general lack of a timeline - the movies timeline doesn't skip or flash forwards; backward; or sidewards, but I felt it was difficult to work out if a scene was taking place 1 day, 1 week or 1 month apart from the previous scene.
An example is when Annie meets Joan in the car park, Joan greets Annie like she hasn't seen her in months, but it feels like she was at Joan's house just a few days ago. I understand Joan's reaction to meeting Annie in the carpark is mostly her excitement for sharing the seance information but the way it's approached makes it feel they haven't talked for a while.
Generally I was disappointed by this movie.I won't watch this again for a long time.",Hereditary

So much of the narrative was told with the camera alone. It's incredibly rare these days to see a relatively mainstream horror have the same constant attention to it's details and narrative that Hereditary maintains over its 2h 7m runtime. During which, I could literally feel nearly half of the people in the theater actively disliking it because they had no idea what was going on. Its constantly dreary atmosphere is aided by its phenomenal score, always driving the tension of the film without ever dipping into the cliche use screechy high strings.Hereditary is about as slow-burn thriller as it gets (Rosemary's Baby being the gold standard for me), and honestly, it was incredibly disturbing - almost at the level of The VVitch (another gold standard for me). Yet, it manages to pull off something neither of those movies do: frighten the living daylights out of you. This is where it starts to get frustrating to me. Hereditary is so close to being a masterpiece that it's painstakingly difficult not to be nitpicky. The leading cast was good, but somehow they all kept falling in the uncanny valley between cheesy but realistic, and down-right unbelievable to me. There were some truly great aspects of each of their performances, but there are a lot of emotional sequences in the film, and it became especially evident in these moments. Occasionally, this managed to kill nearly all of the tension for me, even making me internally laugh in some rather serious moments.Even with it's issues, Hereditary just way too good of a movie to let my nitpicking bog it down too much. Definitely worth a watch for anyone who enjoys the aforementioned Rosemary's Baby or The VVitch.",Hereditary
1993,darren_colledge,Good but temper your expectations. *Contains Spoilers*,7,26 June 2018,"I would caution anyone who intends to view this film to temper their expectations. After reading several reviews and talking to people who had watched Hereditary, I went in expecting the scariest film of the decade and whilst it was undoubtedly unsettling at times and the tension was palpable, (enhanced by the score) I left the cinema wanting a little bit more. To summarise briefly, I think a more ambiguous ending would have served the film better and I would have much preferred the role of Charlie to have been developed further as I think it was a brilliant performance by Milly Shapiro and would have enhanced the terror. The biggest change I would make to Hereditary would be to bridge the gap from normality to the suspension of belief further. I feel there was subtlety early on and then blown out of the window in just one scene. I really enjoyed the visceral aspect of the grief and trauma suffered by the family and thought Toni Collette depicted this fantastically well, especially during the family meal where the simmering, underlying anger bubbled to the surface and showed the human aspect of the tale. All in all a decent watch and definitely a few scenes that will live with me but, as mentioned earlier, I just wanted a little bit more. 7.5/10",Hereditary

It is also creepy in a way that builds as the film progresses.Unfortunately, whilst I don't expect every element of my movies to be realistic, there are a couple of areas of this film which ask me to suspend my disbelief too far.The most annoying of these is the fact that a teenager goes to a party and gets stoned. He has been forced to take his younger sister with him and on the way home an horrific accident occurs and she dies.Does the fact that he was stoned cause him problems with the law? No, it doesn't. The police are not even called. A headless child is buried and there is no sniff of an investigation.This same teenager is clearly having issues after the accident and is withdrawn during classes at school. How do the parents and teachers get together and support him? They don't, they seem to ignore it completely.The younger sister has a severe nut allergy which plays some part in the accident which takes place. It's ok though, they make medicine for emergencies like that, right? Yes... but the family seem to take no care to EVER take an epipen anywhere with them.Any of these things could have helped the situation to a more positive outcome... but then the writer would have had to have worked a bit harder than if they were just ignored.A creepy film, with lazy writing, which builds slowly and then seems to realise that it might be a bit too long and rushes to a disappointing climax.",Hereditary

Very slow in the beginning : I'm ok with character development and setting a backstory. This was just slow
People doing unreal things: : You find a dead body in the attic, YOU CALL THE POLICE!!!

I did enjoy the suspense and slow pase story telling of the first 2 acts of the movie. But end of the second act gave away the entire plot and story of the movie. And the 3rd act where much more was expected and should have happened, was utter disappointment as the suspense went blown away way before.Director has done a real decent job with a script that doesn't catch up with his/her skills.
The main character Toni Collette who was excellent in the first half of the movie, but felt like lost her interest in the second half as she was trying too much and was all over the place.
Alex Wolff looked like stoned through out the movie, but I think he has done justice to the character as it asked for the same.
Catch of the movie is Milly Shapiro as i can say the her acting and casting for the character was too damn good.P.S. I really don't want to call this movie a horror one as it more suits to be a thriller. Reason being it felt like a surgical attack on the audience mind rather than sudden ruthless attack.Hope you guys enjoy this movie.",Hereditary

It is neither .but after first 20 mins something happened that you don't see in many if any movies, and after that it becomes very creepy indeed.

2015,stephanebarbier,The damn formula,8,9 October 2018,"The first hour of young director Ari Aster's new film 'Hereditary' is absolutely faultless. It suggests a polished, contemporized version of Roman Polanski's classic 'Rosemary's baby'. Then a colony of ants appear in a dream sequence in a lazy 1970s-horror-movie way, and from that point on the film falls back into a more predictable territory: after the ants come the flies, the levitation, and the blood signs on the walls. If it fails to deliver on its terrific premise, it gives Toni Collette yet another opportunity to shine (the rest of the cast, especially a very stiff Gabriel Byrne, is no match for her). Without Collette's beautiful acting the movie could as well be a sequel to 'The Amityville Horror'.",Hereditary

The directing, screenplay and overall weak script completely tanked the movie. To be honest, I feel bad for the actors who definitely did what they could with a poorly written and directed movie. Being that there were literally no scares I found myself discouraged as I anxiously awaited for what I paid money for... to be scared.

Tori Collette again as always delivers a fantastic tear jerking performance which I would say is one of her best performances to date. Alex Wolff exceeded my expectations of his acting, and was yet another talented star in the making.

Do NOT do yourself the disservice of missing this masterpiece because other people are either too stupid to understand, or didn't pay enough attention to hints and clues given throughout the movie.To the naysayers: I say you should do some research online to answer your questions about this movie, since it clearly confused you enough to write a bad review. The best advice I have for you is to stop giving movies terrible ratings just because you don't follow what happened.It was a solid movie with absolutely astounding and emotional performances, especially by Toni Collette. The two hours of build-up is essential, and accomplishes its task of building a deep sense of dread. In my opinion, it was also an allegory to mental illnesses that are thought to be passed down among generations. Seriously, just watch the movie and decide for yourself.

However, as the slowwww movie progressed it was going all over the damn place. There's the ""miss my dead kid, do a seance and capture a demon who possesses me"" story line and then a whole nother bat shit crazy story line that happened too quickly, and just felt rushed and ridiculous. When Annie was explaining the book/fire and all of her sudden theories i was rolling my eyes. Like where tffff is this even coming from.

This movie had my stomach churning with horrifying, disturbing imagery and saw me incredibly tense throughout most of the runtime, and Im happy to say I couldn't predict any plot aspects. One of the final sequences in the film was quite definitely one of the scariest I have ever seen. There are of course some flaws; the film is rather slow paced, especially the second act, and at times very monotone.

Fyi The humour is not intentional.Long drawn out moments with the music blaring. They needed to cut at least 30-45 min.Long stretches of nothing actually happening.Plot is a hard meh. Nothing new. 
Conclusion I think it would have been passible with some scenes either shortened or cut. It would have made the movie roll along and kept the ""creepyness"" theme going. Unfortunately they decided to go with drawn out scenes with creepy music and less substance.",Hereditary

Mysterious, unnerving, and suspenseful. But not long after it descends into an absolute joke. Characters behave in illogical, naive, farcical ways. The twists are signposted and the supernatural elements have zero consistency, coherency or logic to themBut worse it gets really really dragged out and basically boring. If It was 40 minutes shorter all of the criticisms above would still apply, but at least it would be relatively lean and well structured. As it is though I found myself just wishing I was watching it at home so I could entertain myself while waiting for the conclusion. And the actual last few minutes make less sense than the rest of the film. Suddenly out of nowhere some ridiculous satanic nonsense appears and to be honest during the last 3-4 interminable minutes there were at least two unintentionally laugh out loud funny moments. Utter, utter garbage. Really. It's not even so bad it's good because it's so ridiculously padded out for the second hour. It would have been 3 stars but I actually feel it needs to be marked down for giving me hope for the first 20-30 minutes.",Hereditary
2053,middlehitter-92234,Hereditary is worth your time,7,23 September 2018,"Those who hate this movie have missed some major points. The mother and grandmother are both psychotic and have suffered from mental illness their entire lives. Toni Collette is a manic insomniac who works relentless and prolifically on her miniature realist scenes that are haunting and horrifying; and apparently well received. Her husband is a hollowed out shell from decades of dealing with his wife and her mother. She even admits at one point that she tried to abort her first born, gave her second born over to her crazy mother to raise and then tried to burn than both in a fire. All the while her mother has been leading a coven and trying to raise a demon to life. When her mother dies, her plan to bring the demon out through her grand daughter, Charlie, is thwarted when she is killed on a horrible and incredible accident that may actually have been orchestrated by some good Power. So the coven switches strategy and engages crazy Mom to hold a seance. This resurrects Charlie and allows her to first possess her mother and then her brother so the demon obtains a human host. The problem is that at two hours the director failed to tighten the script and had to resort to a disappointing exposition by the coven leader. He'd have done better to omit the stupid naked coven people and the cheap laser light show. At the point that Mom is possessed and is actively severing her own head in the rafter he could have let her body fall and ended the movie with the son breaking the fourth wall with a knowing look. People would get to use their imagination to decide if this was a possession or if the son was behind it with the grandmother all along.",Hereditary

2065,booradlee,A review of the reviews,9,15 September 2018,"I'll start by stating that I am a huge horror/thriller fan. Honestly, just an all around movie fan in general. I used to obsess about movie ""magic"" when I was a kid and wanted to work in makeup and set design when I got older. That still hasn't changed, but I now know it's an unrealistic goal. Anyways, I personally feel like I have a good eye for great cinematography and a great sense of what it takes to be a great actor and/or director. However, this is always subjective. Just like all of these reviews. 
I find it funny that while scrolling through the reviews I am seeing either 9's and 10's or 1's and 2's. There are no middle of the road reviews. It seems that you either love this movie or you hate this movie. Now I can sit here and speculate why people hate this movie. A lot of you cannot stand the slow pace that builds up to what you were hoping to be a super climactic ending. Perhaps this is because you are indoctrinated to expect fast paced thrills that build up to the ultimate ejaculatory climax? Or you are just bored easily because you grew up in this new world of vines and fast talking reality tv shows. Or maybe the overhyped expectation let you down? Who knows. 
All I know is that I loved it. It takes a lot to scare me anymore. I grew up in the 90's watching all the original zombie movies, creepy indie films, monster flicks, etc. I have grown numb to horror. The Exorcist was really the only movie that had me afraid of the dark. Specifically a dark staircase. But this movie was the first movie that literally made me sick to my stomach. *SPOILER* Perhaps it is only because I am now a father and the thought of my daughter receiving the same untimely death as theirs did, was too much for me? I have no idea. The more I think about it, I don't think I would have reacted the same back in highschool. But I can say that the audience in the theater with me seemed to enjoy it as much as we all did. I didn't share the same experience as it seems many of you did. Perhaps it's a regional phenomena? That seems ridiculous, but who knows. 
Anyways, I believe this is one of those movies that deserves a second and possibly a third viewing. I am currently watching it a second time and noticing things I didn't notice the first time, which is always a delight for me. I am also realizing that this is one of those movies that is supposed to leave you guessing at the end. Why do movies always have to have a conclusion? What is wrong with leaving people guessing? Isn't that life in a nutshell? I mean, clearly you see that the king of hell has now entered into human form. This is basically the birth of the anti-christ. You can pretty much guess what happens next if you know how that story plays out. 
My point is, not everyone is going to love this film. But don't tell people to stay away from it. Because it could inspire something in someone who is going to make the next great horror film. I'm sure a LOT of you waste 2 hours of your day arguing politics on facebook but you're telling people not to waste their time watching a movie that truly does have some great acting, some beautiful cinematography and some decent story telling? Again, it's all subjective. Watch the damn movie if you want to, with an open mind and then move on to the next moment in your life.",Hereditary

2074,maverickmajorana,But you can't fool a cinephile.,1,28 February 2019,"Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, It Follows, It Comes at Night, and Get Out, were all unique to their philosophies and the context, Hereditary mounted with rest of them makes no sense. The movie must develop with characters and story bold enough to retain viewers to engage all the time. If you look at the husband who had no character development while the rest of members making potpourri of trying to make a potential character. The philosophy of Satanism was least unique after all, because of the over rotten use of the idea by all the characters just as cliché. How come the idea of a light ray as the spirit which is free to move from place to place only hurting family members? How come séance is learned so easily by Annie? You don't make the fun out of core idea ""Spiritualism"" by making it banal as a piece of cake. What were those letters? What does it signify to be a miniature artist? When Charlie observes pencil box the camera focuses but for a reason which is never connected to the rest of the movie. Half of the movie was trying to be deep but it slipped away because of the worst use of postmodern horror themes by making is more stylized and substanceless.It surely borrows from slow burning horrors like It Follows and Rosemary 's Baby but out of reason and context. Obviously, it is important to bring a change in cinema and be revolutionary but in no way, it can be called revolutionary without a substance. Most postmodern horrors are much better and full of explanatory substance. After all, it was bittersweet to watch this movie propagandized as the revolutionary cinema.

Where the devil reigns there are mysteries, suspicions, accusations. Where the devil reigns there is unresolvable guilt, an inability to forgive, homicidal rage.

In this movie, I'm glad to inform the characters didn't do anything foolish during its entirety. Needless to say, that is pretty unique.During the movie, everything was eventually explained. If you focus on the details, you will uncover some very interesting things. Nothing really bothered me after the movie.The actors were mostly very good. There were some scenes, which weren't so well acted. In the end, however, I felt like some of the scenes that were simply put bad, weren't enough for me to dislike the movie.Great horror scenes, that would scare or frighten even the bravest of the audience. The movie had very few of the obvious ""jumpscares"" that are usually so common. The scary scenes horrified rather than scared the viewers. They counted on the viewers ability to concentrate and detect stuff in the background. But don't get me wrong, they were great and there were very many of them.Usually in today's world, movies and series grow worse the more time you spend watching them (the two aren't in correlation with each other).

The storyline is just awful, it drags, its very weak, not in the least bit scary or suspenseful and only the acting from a couple of characters saved this from being a one star review.

But ""Hereditary"" doesn't deliver the goods.
Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne deliver credible performances, but sadly they are let down by the weakness of the storytelling, which never rises above the trite and obvious. In fact, this film is such a maladroit mash-up of established horror tropes, I could be convinced the plot was generated algorithmically. 
I experienced a couple of mild jump-scares, and was grossed-out a few times; but overall, this film not only failed to inspire a sense of horror in me, it also failed to attain the suspension of disbelief that is prerequisite to genuine horror.
Some scenes and effects are so poorly executed, they are actually laugh-out-loud funny rather than scary. I cannot account for the praise that has been lavished on this film, or for the high ratings that it currently has on social media sites, except to suppose that the studio has paid a small army of online sock-puppets to generate hype.

2099,laviolagraphics,Why Is This Even Liked? A Complete And Total Waste Of Time.,1,19 March 2019,"I honestly don't know where to start. I decided to watch this film based on its reviews, but either everyone who gave this title anything above 4 stars watched a different film or the world is going mad.Besides the utter lack of an actual plot, interesting or even likable characters, a music score, decent not over-the-top acting, its biggest flaw is the unforgiving slow and motionless pacing, I can't even begin to describe how boring this film is, honestly you'd be more entertained by watching dough rise.So, let's begin shall we?This film pretends to be a ""horror"", ""drama"", ""mystery"". Honestly I'd even add: ""Comedy"" in there because it is downright laughable, they start of presenting a history of mental illness about the family, which not so subtly foreshadows how the rational member of the family is going to say the (at this point) clichè line ""your're sick, you need help"".Then we're introduced to a weird kid who dies less than 10 minutes after, but the way in which she dies is just hilarious, seriously, she had her head outside of a car and hits a pole and gets beheaded, not only was it extremely unrealistic but it was downright comedic, it's something you'd expect to find in Shawn Of The Dead or another Horrordy.After that you'll get 15 minutes of pure nonsense with hysterical screaming, which is supposed to be the girl's mother crying, but due to the circumstances it just feels funny, so over the top, so melodramatic for the sake of being melodramatic, the plot just hits a screeching halt, the only good scene in this film is when the family is sitting at the dinner table and the mother.Then we're introduced to a new character and from this point forward it's pretty much the same plot of the second ""Annabelle"" film (and we all know that's another pile of rubbish):New Character introduces grieving family members to the occult
One family members believes in the occult the other are skeptics
Family member who believes in the occult still goes through the ritual without actually knowing what they are doing
Family summons demon instead of loved one.Sounds familiar?And this is when the film gets to its climax, I mean, these are some of the most hilarious scenes you'll ever see in a ""Horror"" movie, before finally reaching the end of this atrocity.If you want a dramatic horror movie, go watch The Babadook, if you want a monster horror movie, go watch The Ritual, if you want a supernatural horror film, hell maybe even watch Oculus,This film is downright boring, a complete waste of time.",Hereditary

The film went from grief-ridden scenes to chaotic and harrowing circumstances very suddenly with a confusing yet compelling storyline. The psychological rollercoaster that I experienced during my sitting of this film was both intensely horrifying and melancholic at the same time. The only thing that stopped me from giving this a 10, was the slightly disappointing ending; it wasn't so much disappointing in a way that it ruined the movie, but it tried explaining all the happenings without leaving any ambiguity but instead just left me feeling slightly empty.

Have something supernatural happen with absolutely no reasoning , beg/borrow/steal to get someone vaguely famous in it ( in this case Gabriel Byrne). Include some gore. This is Hereditary. It has the added offence of flashing major plotline in writing (high lighted with yellow marker pen!). Got so bored your mind's wandering?

Toni Collette gave a very convincing portrayal of the woman unable to mentally cope with the horrors inflicted on her. Her descent to madness was slow and building so well that her behavior at the end was very abrupt and ultimately unconvincing to me. To make it worse, the rushed ending forced the creaky ""tell but not show"" plot device to explain everything.Also the modern day setting didn't make sense. The isolated life of the family would have ended the morning after the car accident. The family would have been under investigation well before the incident at the school.

This is so haunting, so dark, so terrifying. And so fascinating. A nightmare that comes crawling, slowly. Not in the big and scary way. Toni Collette is amazing. I love her even more after this one.And the movie was even better the second time I watched it.But I just want to say it again - don't count on that this will be a ten for you as well.

An hour after watching it, I was afraid to look at my reflection in the window. This film is spectacular. Towards the beginning I thought it would be a drama about mother's and their daughters, but boy was I wrong. This isn't one of those movies that will try and gain the ""horror"" label by implementing gory effects and jump scares to try and get a cheap jump out of the audience. This movie gets under your skin and stays there. Personally, horror movies don't typically scare me, but I had to watch 2 palate cleanser movies afterwards to get the rotten taste out of my mouth (She's the Man and 10 Things I Hate About You, and rotten taste is a good thing).

In every single event you, as the viewer, have the exact same feeling as the actor/character.
In general, this is NOT a movie to watch at a sleepover with your friends. You need to watch it alone to truly empathise. Because this isn't a movie which just loops the same jumpscares over and over again like many in the review section wish it was.
I remember not wanting to put my headphones back into my ears the last 20 minutes because I was shocked and frightened. That was because the whole film builds up extremely well. You don't even notice it. It always gets only a bit more crazy. Only a tiny bit so you don't even notice. And at the end it smacks you and everything is freaking out.

Toni Collette is amazing as a woman questioning her sanity. It was really great to see Gabriel Byrne on screen, and he was just perfect as a loving and understanding husband who isn't quite sure his if wife is ok mentally. Ann Dowd is flawless.The plot devices and foreshadowing are all right in the pocket-just enough to get you to notice something, but not in a way where you might think to take note specifically.I really didn't know what I was in for and I was blown away.

Following a relatively benign opening, the story takes an abrupt descent into the declining psyches of the main characters, who are convincingly portrayed as being relentlessly battered by grief and familial decay. Elements of the supernatural are indeed in play, but are executed with such a laudable sense of subtlety that the fabric of the reality being presented becomes decidedly ambiguous--to wondrous effect. From a filmmaking standpoint, the editing and cinematography is phenomenal. No shot is wasted in conveying vital elements of the plot, especially with regard to foreshadowing, and the use of the periphery of the frame to display horrific imagery is far more terrifying than any jump scare--of which Hereditary is all but bereft. In short, this film, the directorial debut of Ari Aster--whose work I will be following closely from this point onward--is one of the most unsettling pieces I have ever viewed and is on par with the mastery of such classics as The Innocents (1961) and Suspiria (1977).",Hereditary

You are forced to watch really uncomfortable scenes and truly unsettling family dynamics, I wanted to leave the movie theater from how tense it was, that's how good Ari Aster was at conveying the emotion. I personally enjoy slow-paced horror with not many jumpscares, with more focus on the creepy and bone-chilling moral dilemmas, therefore I absolutely loved this movie. I have trouble watching it again because it was such an experience for me, and I don't know if I wanna go through that again.To summarize quickly, this is an amazing psychological experience through trauma, family, mental illness and fear, and I was completely immersed the entire time, feeling the characters' emotions and it was horrifying to see the story unfold without having control over it, making you question everything as you leave the theater. If you don't like slow-paced and usually enjoy the classic ""Blumhouse"" movies, you might have difficulty with this one. Nonetheless, it has been a terrifying and exceptional movie for me personally. The amount of hidden details by Ari Aster is amazing, this is the kind of movie that you have to reflect on, and research about after viewing.",Hereditary

I gave it a 4 because I thought the family at least looked like it could be a family. The husband and wife were at least the same age.
Now on to my points.
None of this made any sense at all. I mean, at least TRY to make some sense, okay? If you want us invested in the characters and plot, there must be motivation and reason. Even though this movie was 2 hours long, they couldn't come up with any.
Starts with a funeral. Toni Collette clearly hated her mom. Gives the rudest eulogy ever. Why? Eh, never mind I guess.
Her son wants to go to a party. Apparently he can't be trusted and drinks at parties? At least according to his mom. So he has to take his sister? She doesn't even want to go? She's weird and in elementary school? It's a high school party? And has a deadly allergy? And no epi pen? But no he has to take her according to mom. Maybe Toni is just a b!tch.
So hey guess what, no surprise at all, weird kid has an allergy attack and gets decapitated on the way home. Head knocked clean off!! Son drives the car home and just...goes to bed. Leaves the body in the car for the mom to find and she does.
No cops come.
Son just goes back to school.
No therapy.
They KEEP THE CAR.
Toni keeps telling her husband that she's going to the movies all the time because telling him she's going to a support group would be somehow worse than weirdly going to the movies? They never talk about what she went to see, nah, that would make sense.
Aunt Lydia pops up and has the same exact doormat that Toni's mom used to knit, that's noted by Toni and then it turns out she has a stack of knitted doormats with the family members names on them because that's typical, a whole family having individual entrances in a house.
Oh and guess what fat old people are naked at the end and somehow a 8x8 tree house can fit an entire cult in it.

Not only does this movie take you on a supernatural thrill ride, it also shows very relatable family issues, at least they were relatable to me. Ari Aster took some of his sorrows when he was growing up and put it in this movie. All of these feelings will stick with you long after watching this one. As much as I love this movie it is most definitely not for everyone, so if you like sleep then you don't want to watch this one. Only downside I have for horror fans is after watching this movie other horror movies will not be near as scary as they used to be, that's just how scary this one is. It's a great movie tho, 10/10.",Hereditary
2151,threeas-94666,So disappointed 😔,1,18 March 2020,I was s so looking forward to this one but was soooo dissatisfied. I love Toni Colette but this movie was such a complete disappointment. Boring and predictable. With a couple old cliches thrown in at the end. I was so sad that it was so bad,Hereditary
2152,lanajurisich,Masterpiece,10,3 June 2021,This movie is probably one of the best movies I've seen in my life. It is really disturbing. I couldn't sleep for a while without my lights turned on.Didn't have any expectations but when I saw the name of Toni Collette I knew the movie will be at least solid.It has slow pacing so lot of people in the theatre said it is boring. I disagree. If you are a true horror fan I think you'll appreciate this movie. The cast is excellent also.,Hereditary
2153,Rustymalt,Could've been great,7,8 January 2021,"Okay I like Ari Asters work so far, all his movies have a unique feel to them, especially in terms of cinematography, his use of imagery, and he knows how to pace his films well and build tension. I had heard great thing about Hereditary before viewing it. Some hailing it as ""The Greatest Horror Film of the Modern Era"". So I was really excited going in. And I really enjoyed it. For the most part.The film had such a great story and great characters that just reeled you in. And yes, I too will jump on the Toni Collette bandwagon, because she did a phenomenal job, as did everyone really.So I was going through the motions of watching this film I was getting so caught up in the tension that was being built, I was getting excited from what could possibly be around the corner in every scene. Right up until... the jump (I'll leave it at that for those that haven't seen it). Then it all came crashing down. I felt let down. I felt the film was just breaching into the climax when it just suddenly stops. And that ending... sigh.All in all, obviously people look at it from different perspectives but for me I felt it had so much potential, but didn't quite execute",Hereditary
2154,perryjamesrandall,Ridiculous Film,1,21 October 2020,"The movie starts off great and the suspense builds, but ultimately it surmises that everything is the result of occult worship rather than a genetic component associated with familial mental illness.

I'm out - this movie is a waste of two hours.",Hereditary
2156,richardgowan,"Good acting, terrible ending",3,27 September 2018,Gabriel Byrne looked like he regretted this movie as he was making it. Collette was clearly way to young for him.

Unfortunately the only half good scenes were the ones that were in the previews. The storyline made little to no sense and was hard to follow. By the end it didn't even feel like I was watching the same movie. The amount of twists and side plots made the entire film difficult to digest and a shame to watch.

I'll keep it short and sweet, I, like everyone else are entitled to their opinion. I am no expert, but, in the least possible pretentious way I have a love for filmmaking and know more than most. Ari Aster stated that most everything, even Charlie's death was solely because of the cult. The cult controls everything that occurs in the entire movie. This is signified in the very first shot, showing Annie's dollhouse, slowly panning into a framed shot of Peter's room as Steve walks in. Annie struggles to have control, from her families history with mental health, her relationship with her mom, etc... (hence the name hereditary). So showing this is a nod to how the family simply has a higher purpose that needs to be fulfilled. What makes this movie even better is the marketing behind it. Since when have people enjoyed the entire plot of the film being showed in the trailer? Hereditary purposely made it seem That Charlie would be the central character (even though she sort of is off hand, but not really) through the trailers. Then threw everyone in a loop when she is killed off in the first 30 mins.",Hereditary

I loved Colette since US of Tara, and she is just out of this world. Acting is incredible, every character fits. For any fan of the occult, the story line is just so fresh, very well researched. Shots are beautiful and unsettling, suspenseful lingering panoramas, shady characters, mental illness, Satanism, old settlement mysticism.

It's all scarily real and relatable and makes seeing the tension and grief uncomfortable.The first half of the film is a slow burner, where you get to understand the characters and the emotions.The second half has some terrifying moments that have stuck with me since I watched it in 2018. There's two particular scenes that terrify me, and I have been watching horror films since I was little.It may not be an ending you expect, but if you enjoy horror films that don't have the normal generic horror trope, then watch this film, alone and at night.",Hereditary

2186,Gizela,I was expecting more like the stars from metacritic,2,13 June 2020,The results is disappointing. The movie is scary but the timing is a big no for me. I love watching horror movies since I was kid but not with the long duration of minutes of waiting until the next scene to appear and just to listen those disturbing noisy backsound with the same notes for few minutes which made me feel real bad.

Some of the creepy scenes could even be overlooked if you aren't paying close attention.Was it a good movie that was incredibly creepy the entire time? Yes. Would I ever choose to watch it again? No.To be honest, I only gave it 9 stars because of the mini heart attack I got from the clicking noise in the car scene.",Hereditary
2188,blindst,Mushroom birthday cake.,2,10 June 2018,"Oh dear lord, as I write this review I pray that you might find it within your unending holiness to forgive this cast and supporting characters for the many hours of perfectly good time that hath been wasted. It was a good night, the kind of night that might be stored in the ""remember when"" series of memories one recalls by way of general conversation. We had no idea that were about to embark on a 2 hour journey that would follow one of our companions to the grave and quite possibly put to an end his authority to make decisions on what movies we just have to go see.There was a huge gap between a head getting lobbed off by a pole, and one of those naked bear guys holding his belly up while his dong dangled freely in the moonlight that I just stared at an oversized screen, waiting and listening with all my might for something to just start making sense. Is this what happens when a genre reaches a peak and begins to fizzle out? Do we really need an over intellectualized movie about ""what if Grandma was a Satanist?"" I thought this was reserved for low budget comedy flicks of the 80's. Maybe that is the silver lining here because when we saw the 4 nudes in the woods at a critical point in the wrap up, it was all we could do not to laugh, and quite frankly the hour and a half of pure emotionless boredom that preceeded that moment took it out of us, so we just laughed for a good two minutes, knowing that the joke was on us. Then we went home to watch something else to try and rinse the boredom off of us. Thanks Ash we owe you one.On a side note, Dear Toni Colette, I have enjoyed a number of your films, how these people managed to convince you to be in this movie, then hang from a ceiling while sawing your head off is a fabulous show of salesmanship.

This deserves to be in top 250.This was the most horrific movie I have ever watched and trust me, I have seen all, including the super scary Japanese ones as well. I kept on delaying watching this movie due to the low rating.This is not just horror but pure art. The scenes where the coffin is lowered into the grave and the camera moves like you are going into the grave, when the sister dies and peter just could not look at the back seat was true horror as well as real. I felt I am peter and I did something terribly wrong, I would have done exactly the same thing as he did, did not look at the backseat, I am glad he didn't but like peter i kept on thinking maybe the sister is alive, by any chance, maybe if I don't look and reach home , maybe there is an off chance that she is alive.

they do explain why things happen the way they do, but its almost at the end, and by then most of you may fell asleep.
this movie is interesting at best, but not a horror shocker.

2193,mhibbing-1,"Headed for cult status of the ""so bad it's good"" variety",1,4 October 2018,"Saw this film with my teenage kids and it was without question one of the dumbest, non-scary, pretentious, horror movies that I have ever seen. The acting is insanely over the top, the plot was just plain stupid, it dragged on endlessly while all the while appearing to go nowhere. Then the unthinkable ""happened"".... and SAVED the entire evening! The movie got so bizarre and so bad that it became ""good"". Seriously folks, I was furious up to that point feeling duped by all of the obvious shill reviews and then the plot took a ""hard right"" and the audience was in fits of laughter as a result. Without revealing any ""spoilers"" (and trust me there is no such thing as ""SPOILERS"" when it comes to this movie) it gets so incomprehensibly bad that the entire audience lost their collective lunches. There were jokes flying and howling right through to the credits. Under normal circumstances this would have annoyed me, having paid over $85.00 for admittance and concessions only to have people making jokes and screaming loudly. But oddly enough, it actually salvaged what was to that point an awfully traumatic movie going experience. In fact, me and the kids laughed all the way home. Yes, it's THAT bad.
 If you don't believe me, look up all the reviews from people who did NOT like this film and see how many of their reviews mention the unintentional comedy at films end and the audiences reaction to it. It's so bad that it's not to be believed.
 My experience watching this film reminded me of the scene in the movie ""The Producers"" where the audiences initial response to ""Springtime for Hitler"" was one of utter disbelief, only to end in uproarious laughter by the plays intermission. This was me and the kid's experience EXACTLY. 
 So, to sum up: if your looking for a genuinely scary horror film with a great plot and capable acting that'll have you on the edge of your seat, stay as far away as humanly possible from this hot mess. However, if your looking for ""The Room"" with a supposed horror theme, this movie is for YOU!",Hereditary

2196,pure_redrose,Quality horror movie. I had no idea about the hype.,10,11 November 2018,"After several simple ratings this is my first review. Note, I didn't watch the trailer beforehand nor gotten any of the hype.First off, if you're not sure whether to watch this movie or not, give it a go. Period. Its not nearly a bad as a b movie with amateur filming and horrible acting that it deserves 1 star. Plus, those who don't like it have probably commended at least one aspect of the film that works well... to the extent that altogether they've commended all aspects of it.Regarding the pace, it's really not bad. I personally didn't notice a lag. One reviewer here actually said there's not enough jump scares. So that kind of tells you what type of people are rating this badly. No offense but I'm just pointing that out so you understand. The film is about quality not quantity. I personally prefer the ""thriller"" aspect of a scary movie rather than the jump scares and bloody scenes (these are present in the film though and blend well). If you understand and appreciate that too then you might appreciate this movie. And either way, there are enough exceptionally done twisted and bizarre scenes to fill that horror hole.Hereditary is about making you feel disturbed and creeped out, but wanting to continue watching. It's about build up to a realistic scare..not one just so you can laugh afterwards. There is a solid storyline and every scene has relevance. The story behind the evil spirit is not complicated at all, which I appreciated not for its simplicity but because there was no need to make it confusing like some films do. It worked in a sensible concise way.The family interaction is realistic, not empty. Teenagers dont normally have deep personalities per say and the mother is just being a mother. Its a typical relatable family. Not arbitrarily uncaring or over the top. Realistic.
Also, someone mentioned that it was impractical for the boy and the family not to get therapy of some type. I'll give them that. But only partially because the reality is many people don't have the desire (or money) to speak to someone else about their problems. It's not something you need to suspend disbelief for. Plus the boy's parents were not there to see what he had done and it's unlikely he would have asked to go to a therapist so they took it for what it was.Just wanted to counter a few points and give one a wider picture of the critic of the film. I'm not trying to give spoilers so about the ending I'll just say out was haunting once you understand. And i think it's easy enough to understand. The movie overall for me was one of my favorite horrors in a while. Hope you enjoy if you watch.",Hereditary
2197,rude-boylive,Overhyped rubbish,2,21 June 2018,"I went to see this film based on reviews of people who have seen the film and the ""star"" rating given by publications like Empire and Total Film.
The first hour nothing much happened. I thought setting things up for the second hour when things will take off. Wrong! The second hour was a boring as the first. The film boils down to a witches coven trying to give life a demon in a human host. It so bad in parts that the audience including me were sniggering. See it done better than this film. 
Toni Collette I thought was good which is the only reason it got two stars. Apart from her the rest of the cast including Gabriel Byrne was completely forgettable.
I can't believe Empire magazine which I place a great deal of reliance to provide a rating which truly reflects how good / bad a film is, got this soooo wrong for this film. Also, how other people scored this film more than three stars at best is beyond me.",Hereditary
2198,hamish_eastwood,Two Hours of Anxiety!,10,24 August 2018,"I don't think I've watched another film as anxiety-inducing as Hereditary. From the opening scene there is a feeling of wrongness... and that feeling continues to grow as the film goes on. If you're paying attention to the surroundings as well as to the actors (who are brilliant!!), you see things that raise your hackles; sometimes you need to do a double-take... just to make sure you saw correctly. It'll mess with your mind. And just when you think you've figured it out, the film throws something else at you, completely shattering that belief.A lot of people say the ending makes no sense. But everything that happens in the film, from the very beginning, adds up. It's supernatural; it's mental health; it's family, and loss, and grief. I thought the ending was pretty much perfect. It was almost calming, in a strange way (no spoilers though... you'll either know what I mean, or you'll think I'm a weirdo). When the credits roll, you breathe a sigh of relief, then immediately want to talk about it with someone! It's in no way forgettable, and that feeling of anxiety takes a good while to leave you. I think that's what makes a horror movie - any movie really - truly great.
 
It's not a film made to gross you out, or make you jump (though you might once or twice), which I suppose is what a lot of people were expecting, thus they hated it. It's a simmering horror. It's two hours of anxiety and tension and darkness. It'll leave you feeling pretty damn fragile (I know I needed a hug after watching it!).

Between being bored I laughed through what was a poor attempt of horror tactics. Even the few special effects were naff like out of an old Hammer movie. 
I actually was crying with laughter in the final 15 minutes along with most people in the cinema (naked oldies in the bushes is not scary, just plain funny).
Someone, somewhere has spent a lot of money paying critics to hype this movie up, and it is just plain wrong. For those who have not been paid and who still rave on about it, I can only assume they have never watched a horror film before.

I thought it was gonna be a typically psychological thriller and man was I wrong. It didn't scare me very much while I was watching it. It ended... and I just sat there like wtf just happened.

Seances w/ finger touches, candles in dimly lit sequences, sleepwalks, demons, psychics, screams etc. Exactly what you expect from your everyday supernatural horror movie, only this one comes with a very strong lead (Toni Collette) on the one hand, more than two gratuitous hours of running time on the other. Let's just say that the typical 80 mins would be just as good for this one, as neither its overlong build up nor its conclusive ""revelation"" make, eventually, any difference at all.I really don't know why they keep making movies like these. I mean, you can tell that the director is talented, having crafted his scenes carefully and with vision. Why choose to channel this talent on an overplayed theme and storytelling that hasn't been able to make a difference over the last 30 years?
Rhetorical question, of course. I can only guess the an$wer.See it or don't see it. At best, you'll have just one more girl face to add in your ""little freaks from movies"" list since The Exorcist.

2215,nchodoba,Truly Terrifying,9,2 November 2020,"If a film stays with you days after you have seen it, and still the images leave you shaken, wasn't that film successful? I ask rhetorically because I am on the side that says this is a truly great horror film, if not just a great dramatic film. My reasons follow below.
YOU have to figure this film out, it is not up to the film creators to spoon feed us the information needed to make sense of all this. Nowhere in the film maker guidebook does it say the story has to be explained in total to the audience. I would argue that the story is told in total very well and all the puzzle pieces are laid out before us to figure out the truly horrific ending.
The players are doomed in this hardcore tragedy of a film. But it is the execution of the work that stays with me, the sheer bravado of the filmmaker to inflict such a total horror experience for those willing to stay with the story as it goes.
People say why not call the police? Well, even Hitchcock decried using police in his works because basically, the police are not going to win because his films were trying to evoke suspense, terror, and thrills. This film as well. The police can't help us says Toni Collette's character. When she says that it is true, especially with all the satanism, cult rituals, etc going on.
I notice that people who say they LOVE horror films want to denounce this film, because it doesn't fit into their mold. That's fine, but why not praise a film you love rather than denounce one you hate? I am doing that here. This is my first review on IMDB. I love this site.

2240,mattis-sehlstedt,"Interesting concept, absurd yet skillful execution",6,29 November 2020,"After watching this one and Asters ""Midsommar"", the prevailing thematics of his style becomes quite clear. He draws on familliar situations and emotions but takes it to an extreme level in terms of trauma born out of innocence and unconsciousness. Now, it is in that sense i find Hereditary to be predictable, it setups a familliar everyday enviournment and relatable characters as a framework for the insidious shock-fest that ensues.The writing of his characters is done in such a novel and skillful way that when he ruthlessly takes them to these extreme states, it becomes a palpable shell shock. One thing the film does very well is immersion due to the intentionally claustrophobic and low lit interiors with slow face shots and tension build. It draws you in and wants to twist what you know into what is unknown or unconscious in us, to lay bare some ominous spiritual heritage or an expression of severe mental illness/paralyzing PTSD.Hereditary is well filmed and very well acted but falters in its narrative when it divulges into absolute unhinged maddening terror that unfortunately comes across more like comedic absurdism rather than psychological horror. This is mostly due to how horror is treated in the first half of the film compared to its final scenes, it is initially treated as something deeply ominous and psuedo-realistic to then a sloppy absurdist no-holds barred style that attemps to capitalize on pure shockvalue. That being said, this film still got to me and that's what it manages most of all; subconscious intrusion.",Hereditary

For a movie that comes in at just over two hours there is little to no explanation as to what is happening or why.
There are references to the occult, demonology and Paganism which the director is just expecting the audience to know about.
The topic has obviously been well researched with references to Satony, Zazas, Liftoath Pandemonium and King Paimon. But, what does it all mean? And what is the significance of the door mats?

2248,josh2288,Instant classic,10,10 June 2018,"Let me say first and foremost that this film will let down many modern or contemporary horror fans. Many fans introduced to the genre since the late 90s into the Millennium might not appreciate this type of scary movie. Movies have conditioned us in recent years that blood and cheap scares are the only effective ways to scare us. The Director does throw in some ""jumpscare"" type moments though. This is not ""Insidious"" or the ""Evil Dead"" remake. Do yourself a favor and skip this and wait for the new ""Purge"" movie if that's what you are after (and I love those types of movies as well just to be clear.) They are fun films and usually leave me filled with ""hell yea"" moments. This film left me with the ""what did I just watch"" 
Toni Collette delivers the performace of her career in this film as ""Annie"" the Mother of thr family. Let me take a moment to brag on Toni. She is by far the most underrated actress in the business right now. She stole my heart with her part in ""Krampus"" as the Mother of that movie as well. She is so raw in this movie it's truly amazing. Toni delivers one of the most gut wrenching performances in movie history with this one. If she is not up for ""best actress"" at this years Oscars I will be so angry.The rest of this very small cast of this movie is phenomenal. Milly Shapiro as the Daughter with a dead stare like a rock will break you mentally in ways you're not accustomed. Gabriel Byrne does a nice job with his character of ""Steve"" the father trying to keep the family together as turmoil unfolds. Alex Wolff steals the show as the stoned teenage son who looks like he hates the world and everything in it. You know normal 16 year old stuff. Be prepared to see the face of Alex Wolff in many films to come. What this movie does so well is what i call the ""roller coaster effect"" the first 30 minutes are the upward climb ""click click click click"". The next 30 minutes is the big drop, you feel your stomach in your throat. And then BAM the last hour is loops and swoops and turns and drops and holy mother of all that is good this movie is a ride! I will say the imagery will leave you breathless in scenes. The score had my hair standing up the whole movie. This film really excels in the cinematography department. Visually unlike anything any viewer has ever scene. Truly original plot. What else can i say? I literally had no negative complaints of this movie other than the ending....but it's a really great ending. It just punched me in the chest and ripped my soul out of my body but no big deal.""Hereditary"" deliver several of the most horrifying and shocking scenes that I have ever witnessed.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**
From the start of the movie you begin seeing a strange symbol (Annie and Ellen Leigh's necklace), I noticed immediately that it would be of significance. Pay attention to the funeral attendees, you'll be seeing them later on. Also pay attention to the words Charlie has carved into the walls over her family members beds.
During a grief counseling session Annie discloses that she attended therapy in the past, that she had a brother who hated their mother and committed suicide because Ellen (Leigh) was ""trying to put people into him."" It's implied that the same happened to Joan's son and grandson, who both died by drowning. I interpreted this to mean Joan's son knew his boy would be a viable host and thus drowned himself and his small son. Annie even admits to her son (Peter) that her mother basically forced her to get pregnant and have him, that she'd kept him away from her as a result. However, when Charlie was born (expected to be a boy) Ellen ""doted on her"" even insisting on breastfeeding the baby herself, which we see in one of Annie's miniature recreations. This behavior wore down Annie's defenses until Annie finally relinquished and ""gave"" Charlie to Ellen. This lets us know that Ellen promised King Paimon (a prominent figure in demonology) a suitable (male) host and although Charlie was expected to be a boy (hence the Charles welcome mat in Ellen's box of things), he settled for a girl because she'd already summoned him. This means that Charlie had been Paimon's host from the moment she was born, and so had Peter. This revelation explains a TON, from Charlies physical defects, to her odd obsession with headless ""toys"" (figurines), to her decapitation of the deceased bird, to the clicking noise she makes.
Charlie's death was also orchestrated long before they even left home for the party. We see this in Paimon's symbol etched into the light post, to the party girl manically chopping nuts next to the chocolate cake poor Charlie will later consume. There were multiple avenues of death awaiting Charlie, just as there were multiple avenues of resurrection awaiting Paimon (note the pamphlet that slips through Annie and Steve's mail slot).
Hereditary also serves as a deep allegory for mental illness:
Ellen was diagnosed with D.I.D (dissociative identity disorder), Annie's brother was a paranoid schizophrenic, which eventually led to his suicide. Annie herself suffers from mania and possible bipolar disorder (the mania is noted in an email we see Steve drafting --it's implied that he was once her therapist). Even Peter's classroom hallucination self-harm episode could be explained away as the beginnings of schizophrenia. All these mental illnesses are manifesting in the next generations, so they've inherited a curse any way you slice it. Thus, Paimon serves to not only give the coven what they seek, but to also deliver Annie and Peter from the prisons of their dwindling minds.
There was so much thought and research put into Hereditary, everything in this film is intricately and beautifully interwoven, which is one of the aspects that make Hereditary so fantastic.",Hereditary

There was also a huge number of things that did not make sense at all, and while you try to piece together the puzzle you start to realize that this movie isn't scary at all. On top of that they touch on themes that have already been used in better, more coherent horror movies. Add in some atrocious acting by the kids and an overrated performance by Toni Collette and you get a perfect recipe for disaster. Some of the scenes were actually pretty funny because of how God awful they executed them. The writing was also comparable to an elementary student's.

Sure, it's a slow burner that sucks you in, but the last 15-30 minutes left a lot to be desired. So much so, I was actually laughing. I felt the film could've created so much more with the general plot and made it all the more believable/plausible. Two points in the main - 1) there was no follow through at all post Charlie's death; no police, no family interaction (until way into the film over the dinner table) and 2) Annie's headless body floating up into the treehouse was tantamount to parody. Other folk that were there commented post viewing, that they couldn't believe the reviews they'd read about how scary etc the film was. Having read a few on this site, supports what they'd read.

2272,ldcubellis,What the heck was that!?,1,15 September 2018,"As I grow older, I feel films intentionally become more depraved, exploring every dark twisted crevice of human imagination. I get horror films, I've usually been a fan of the genre, A Quiet Place was excellent and there are many in my favorites list. But when I come across films like this, touching on witchcraft, satan worship and pure evil, I can't see them for masterpieces as these subjects are real world (actually happening as we speak). I can disassociate with Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Meyers and larger than life creatures, caricatures, etc. that take us on dark journeys, but the real monsters in this world are people. These subjects, I believe, get embedded in our psyche, it's an implantation of evil that is wholly possible in the world. Life does not imitate art, but art imitates life. It feels like more and more TV and movies have the most broken, twisted people as protagonists, there's few ""good"" characters these days, its warped vs broken). Media is used as propaganda (Edward Bernays), to set agendas and become part of the human condition and thought processes. Violence is all around and being cultivated. They don't call it the idiot box for nothing. For me, each subsequent scene was more profane than the last, it left me feeling gross and wishing I hadn't seen it. I guess to sum it up, I know (backed by science) IQs are dropping, people increasingly look to pop culture, TV, movies, etc. for guidance on behavior/attitudes. I'm not sure how many folks watch things these days and can easily pick out the programming, subtext and agendas being presented. And if think I'm going to far, whether these writer/directors are in on it, keep in mind movie studios have final say and are constantly selecting and shaping your choices. Want further proof? I worked in the music industry a good while and saw first hand how exec's, record labels and station programmers were bought off, bribed in order to provide a narrow selection of music for the public. You were spoon fed artists that had been selected to be succes's long before you ever heard them. Our lives are largely an illusion with just enough freedom to keep us from rebellion. Yeah, this piece of garbage movie made me get all existential, because this represents the trends in junk we're steadily fed these days.

With about 10 minutes to go, as the horror has built up over the course of the last two hours, the director pulls the rug from under your feet and the phrase 'what the...' never quite completes in my head as I struggle to understand what has happened. The difficulty I have is not plot related. I understand the story. Its the style, the near total descent into cliche and abandonment of terror, for what is frankly unintentionally comic, right at the point where you hope for the horror to overwhelm. Its like a wave you see offshore, building in power and strength only to hit the beach and break, sending minor waves over your toes as you stand there wondering what happened to the fury. What happened to the director? Endings take time to construct, sets are built and actors learn lines. Did no-one think, 'Really? This?, Come on, lets have a word with Ari'.The part which delivers the greatest horror takes place much earlier and had me captivated, is a scene involving a fast car ,Charlie and her brother. That placed me right into the movie, wondering how you get out of this, where do you go? For that scene alone, and what unfolded from it, was worth going to see, as was Toni Collette's acting. Its just a shame about the lame, hackneyed ending. As scary as accidentally stumbling into a nudist colony for middle aged surburbanites. Really, it defies explanation.Score 9/10 for the first 110 minutes. Final scenes? They should be re-shot. Score adjusted for the ending.Oh, yes, I loved the sound track. Suitably sparse and creepy.

After i watched it I was disappointed of the movie.At first I want to say that the story is a good one. There are enough twists in the storyline to make it interesting. Each time I thought I could predict what follows, turned out completely different. Also a BIG APPLAUSE to the actors and actresses in this movie. They did a terrific job. I was actually starting to mirror myself with some things that has been said during the movie. The tension was well-built. The further the movie went, the more tension there was visible in the characters.Sadly enough the movie itself was sometimes boring to watch. It was litterally the first time ever that I yawned while watching a horror movie. During the 2 hours I was sitting in my comfy chair in the theatre, I felt only one chill in the entire time. One jumpscare at the end of the movie gave me that chill. The makers did give some subtle hints at the beginning of the movie to show what will follow. But it takes too long to give the meaning because most of the viewers will forget those subtle hints in the start when the end is there.This movie is a recommendation for those who don't only want to watch horrormovies for jumpscares. There is strong tension in this movie, but it takes too long to connect all the stuff in the beginning of the movie to what happens in the end. So I would say: if you only like to be scared in a horrormovie, you shouldn't see this one. If you like a good story attached to it: strong recommendation.",Hereditary

It all spirals out of control halfway through when a psychic runs into her in the parking lot.

***Warning, might contain spoilers***
Great cast, Toni Collette could almost save this movie singlehandedly....almost. It is atmospheric, it is tense, the phrase ""slow burning "" has been SO overused to describe this movie. It got boring, yes boring, not slow burning, boring. 
Foreshadowing abounds, the mother's necklace, the utility pole, the book. A discussion in class about characters having free will or being ""puppets"" or dolls, moved about with no hope....a tie in with the miniatures / doll houses that Toni Collette's character creates.
The horror genre by it's very nature dictates some suspension of rational behavior, this movie takes it to another level. A child with severe allergies and hinted at developmental issues without an epi pen, a fatal accident where no police are involved, a husband who doesn't trust his wife because she tried to kill their children while sleepwalking, but has no problem with her going to sleep somewhere else.... Someone tries to kill my kids, at bare minimum I am going to watch that person like a hawk.

We would have gotten kicked out of our local Alamo Drafthouse for laughing, at the film. Early on, we thought that it might be an intentional horror-comedy, but nope. Wasted actors; story lines that go nowhere, because they are really about the nifty set design (the mother's miniature dioramas); _absurdly_ non-sensical plot details (yes, take your kid sister with life-threatening peanut allergies and for whom we cannot be bothered to carry an Epipen to your teenage party!)--and then it really goes off the rails.

Annie is either mentally ill or going through a supernatural possession either of which could be hereditary...I guess. The daughter, Charlie was creepy but the character development is lacking. Peter was at the center of the film though his character also wasn't developed much. The father had a weak and passive role. Even the cult wasn't explained much. In the end, the cult wins and the spirit and/or Charlie possesses the body of Peter. I won't be watching it again and I won't be recommending the film to others either.

2321,aprilataylor-987-772764,"Devastating, Thought-Provoking Horror",10,3 November 2018,"Do you like quiet, devastating horror that looks at family dysfunction and isn't afraid to show how ugly the world can be? Hereditary, much like Mike Flanagan's recent take on The Haunting of Hill House, is a family drama at its core, but that's exactly why it's so horrific. The tension between the characters is always palpable, but it ends up building to such a fever pitch that you may find yourself wanting to take a break during the movie.There's one incident in the movie that's so shocking you're almost certain to still be thinking about it several weeks later. It's a huge game changer that takes the movie in a direction you'll never see coming. As long as no one has spoiled the incident for you, that is. It left me reeling, and that's very hard for a horror movie to do.By the end of the film, everyone will get at least a taste of what they're looking for; there's quiet, introspective, humanity-based horror, some gore, a few freaky sequences that will make sensitive viewers squirm and maybe even shriek, and a more classic horror element that I won't spoil in this review.Having said all of that, Hereditary truly isn't for everybody. There's a reason this film is so divisive. Much like The Haunting of Hill House (TV and book versions), Get Out, and modern horror books such as Where the Cats Will Not Follow and The Haunting of Cabin Green, this movie was clearly made with a certain group of horror fans in mind. It's thought-provoking and is meant to spur deep discussions about its many layers and themes. The filmmakers also understood that no matter how much gore or how many supernatural creatures you put on the screen, the most horrifying things in the world can always be found within ourselves and within the disconnect that occurs within many family relationships. If that sounds good, you'll love this movie. If, however, you prefer tons of blood and/or a humorous approach to horror, you'll probably be best served by watching something else.",Hereditary

The first hour is incredibly slow and it feels like 80% of the plot development takes place in the last 30-45 minutes. The thing that made PA/Insidious and similar films entertaining for me were the suspense and the scares, which are few and far in between in this film, and they're not as scary. The acting was pretty good but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even to friends who love the genre. Frankly I was really surprised this movie is rated at 7.9.",Hereditary

But for gawd sakes people it is not scary it is not what I could ever all a horror movie or a must see horror movie for horror fans. I would claim it to be more of a suspense mystery thriller than a horror movie. Horror is to be scared, horrified, terrified; you talk out of the movies and you watch every step you take, you listen because you expect it to happen to you next. Hereditary was good, it had a 2 good little for newbies scares. It has more SHOCK, WHAT THE HECK just happened scenes than horror. The movie left you wanting to know what was ""F"" was going on. That is why I am writing this. It is not a horror movie and any REAL DIEHARD horror buff/fan will agree with me. If you want to watch a good suspense mystery thriller then watch this movie. But if you are wanting a horror movie with leaves you scared or wanting to check inside your car before you drive home; then this movie isn't gonna live up to what you want...

We begin to know the members of the family and we meet the youngest girl charlie, a weird little girl that cuts off the head of birds (she even looks scary). From there on strange things start to happen and when the movie evolves all the pieces of the puzzel begin to fall togheter and you're left with a wtf feeling at the end. When you're a fan of the horror genre i can understand that you are somewhat dissapointed. It's not all blood and gore, but more of soft tension build up. The story reminds me of that of paranormal activity (i think the 3th in the franchise). Where they need a male boy to summon a demon. It's not your typical jump scare movie but more of an ieuuuuw and wtf??? I enjoyed it but the ending had me feeling a bit strange, not knowing how to react.

Well, short story is, it wasn't. Not even close. I have to admit, immediately after watching it, I was like, OK, interesting story, certainly was creative. Not particularly scary, but it takes a lot to frighten me. The more it kind of marinated in my head, the more I realized it was full of plot holes big enough to drive a semi through. Even if it is never explained why Peter must jump out and die so his body can be possessed by Charlie and he can go on to become the leader of their cult (I mean if Charlie's spirit can possess a dead body, why not just possess Charlie's disembodied head? That would be way cooler), why the series of impossible coincidences that ultimately lead to Charlie's beheading in the first place? It seems that the point here is that Charlie has to die in order to lead this weird cult, but if that's the case, why no let her just die from her allergic reaction? Any number of different things could have happened that would have prevented her from being decapitated. Why didn't Peter call an ambulance when Charlie fell ill? If he still chose to drive her to the hospital, what are the chances that a deer would jump out in front of the car causing him to swerve to the EXACT location where a telephone pole was conveniently placed to knock her block off? Even if we invent the story that the deer was placed there by supernatural forces, how do we know that Peter will swerve to that EXACT spot, not drive off the road and recover control or hit somewhere else where there is not a telephone pole. Too much to chance. Too many questions with not enough satisfactory answers. This movie is momentarily entertaining, but an overall dud.",Hereditary

Forget Paimon, the demon, or whatever spirit or entity it is, all of it really is just about fantasies of a person (Ellen) with a severe mental disorder triggered by the loss of a child that commited suicide (Charles). The pain led to a severe psychosis in which multiple non-existent protagonists interact (Peter, Steve, Joan, Charlie (which is a projection of the lost child Charles) and by extension everyone you see in the movie). Everything is just about madness and the abyss it could drag one in. Three generations are depicted as having hereditary mental disorder, when in fact there is only one.

In my case, i think this one grabs your attentiton right from the start, not wearing you out at all. The acting amazed me so much! Especially considering I used to watch Alex Wolff in The Naked Brothers band.
The plot is not explained untill the last cenes, not getting the usual horror end, when most of the time things are let in the air. Even when i predicted some acts, they were so well done that still kept my attention the whole time.
Keep in mind though, this is not for the usual horror enthusiastic. The movie keeps you uncomfortable and anxious most of the time, giving a lot of attention to the plot, which some may find tiring, but for me it's what made this movie so well constructed. The movie will make you tense and disgusted, but don't expect to see any jumpscares around here.",Hereditary

We have had to wait a long time for an intelligent, well acted, and cleverly crafted horror movie to come along, and for that we should rejoice. I was very surprised by the plot twist, it was something I didn't see coming, it puts it in a league with Rosemary's Baby and the Wicker Man really, a modern folk horror movie. What I didn't like was how loud this was, the early scenes introduce what I can only describe as techno music playing in the background that sounds like music intruding from a movie playing in the auditorium next door, it was very distracting and not really in a good way.

2426,film7film,What a Gem - NO SPOILERS,8,17 February 2021,"I will start by saying Horror films are not usually my favourite genre, I find a lot of horror films tend to follow the same blueprint or template with different characters and different settings, then in turn rely on jump scares. Which I find to be sometimes lazy and the actual film plot can sometimes go on the back burner.There is nothing wrong with this and its the jump scares which people purchase tickets for and fulfils the adrenaline which people seek. As I said this sells, there is nothing wrong with this. Just my humble opinion.That being said, regardless of genre If a film is a good film, count me in. Hereditary is certainly an exception to my theory and being honest, blew me away. The build up of tension along the way was superbly done, a slow enough build but feeding you bits along the way to keep you on the edge and boy did it delivery when the time came.The CGI when called upon allows us to believe that what we are seeing is not out of the realms of possibility, which is ridiculous of course however this amplifies the scares and intensity. Toni Collette leads the way with this as well with one of her finest performances for sure.There are some shocks and twists along the way which take you back, which I love. I watched this with someone who had their hands over the face for the majority, especially the last 30-45 minutes. This is a credit to the film IMO and the last 30-45 mins that I mentioned will stick with me for some time. The barometer on which I sometimes judge / rate a film is, will you remember this, tomorrow, next week, month year. The answer here is yes. It's truly shocking, in a good way, and I will certainly be watching again in the near future.This is a truly modern classic Horror and regardless of genre a truly great film.",Hereditary

Then, 15 minutes from the end... it was almost like watching a different film, the jumps and oh my gods from earlier on from the audience had now changed to... laughing...

2430,madzima,Horrifyingly Awful,1,10 June 2018,"Reading all these reviews about what a ""Masterpiece"" this movie is makes me wonder if I missed something or if I'm just stupid. If you're someone who's raving about how creative and revolutionary this movie is, you're either just trying to fit in as a horror movie snob or saw a completely different movie. Seriously, I sat there through the first hour of the movie and wondered if I somehow walked into the wrong theater and was seeing a different movie. The pacing is incredibly slow, and I understand that the first half of a slow burning horror film like this one is supposed to build suspense, but unlike other horror flicks this film keeps you waiting and waiting and waiting for absolutely nothing. The only positive thing about this movie is the acting. The movie does have good performances from Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette, although I don't feel her acting is ""Oscar worthy"" like people are saying. It just makes me wonder how desperate these two great actors must have been for a paycheck. This movie was marketed as something that would make people rethink what horror movies are all about. In the end, there's nothing to spoil about this movie because nothing happens. The plot develops extremely slowly as a poorly written family drama. Then in the last 20-30 minutes the director must have remembered that he was supposed to be making a horror movie and just slapped together an ending full of countless scary movie cliches that left everyone in the theater scratching their heads. Someone at my showing actually said out loud when the credits began to roll ""wtf was that movie"" and everyone laughed.I get that cinematography wise this movie is supposed to be brilliant, because it does look pretty good. But good visuals aren't enough to save a boring movie with a poorly put together plot in my opinion. I've seen a few other reviewers on here mention how people in the audience were laughing out loud during the ""scary"" parts of this movie, and I can say that most of the theater I was in, including myself, was filled with people laughing and loudly cracking jokes at how cliche and confusing the ending of this movie is.

The start is atmospheric and this leads on to a pivotal incident in the plot which definitely shocked me and gave me great expectations for the remainder of the film. Unfortunately my expectations weren't met. The plot looped around at the end without much explanation as to why the things that were happening were going on and it almost seemed as though the writer just wanted to wrap things up in any way possible rather than making a decent end to it.
As a study of human grief and behaviour it is excellent but even this it is let down by an ending which doesn't fit with the rest of the story.
Overall it is well acted and beautiful to look at but the random plot twist and ending let it down and whoever billed this as a horror movie is in the wrong job",Hereditary

While the first two resemble a theatrical drama, this one is less metaphorical but still characterized by the same tension.

It does a great job with acting, production, music, cinematography, etc. but the theme and subject matter are just too evil and unnerving for my taste.

2438,declanclow,A Better Drama Than Horror,8,16 October 2018,"The debut film from Ari Aster comes off as a far better Drama, or even Psychological Horror, than a true Horror film. Perhaps that comes from years of subjection to jump scares and cheap gorey tricks that the hollywood wants us to believe makes a good horror film. But when I think back to films such as Alien I remember what true horror feels like (I may have hidden behind a pillow for the most part of that film), a feeling I never experienced during this film. Yet I became deeply intrigued by the bizarre events that occur to the characters, taking me on an eventful journey full of twists and turns. For the most part the acting was fantastic. In particular Toni Collette, whose character could have easily turned to a stereotypical screaming white woman, instead formed an outstanding character study who I could barely take my eyes off. However, I would like to take a moment to focus on the role of Peter played by Alex Wolf. For me this is where the film stumbles and I am unsure whether it is a writing, directing, acting, or a mixture of all three. Throughout the film we watch the lives of intriguing people with there own intergrule backstories, and then we have Peter who appears to be a stereotypical edgy highschool student. Yet the character is written as though he is eight years old which grates like nails down a chalkboard in contrast to his surface appearance. He constantly says mommy and bawls and the drop of a hat which in turns pops the viewer out of the experience of the world. Perhaps if the actor was stronger, or if it was re-written this part may have worked.All in all this film was a great journey that was grounded and a joy to watch.",Hereditary

I found the movie plodded along at a tortuously slow pace. the overtly long shots, on characters and family scenes well overdone. I assume this was used to portray some sort of feeling of the family's plight, tensions and, to a degree, dysfunction. that said, the fact I found nearly all the characters heartily unsympathetic meant this was lost on me. I just found myself (mentally) shouting at the screen 'get on with it'.nor can I say I was a huge fan of the acting. all those blank stares, gurning, I found bordering on the funny. particularly painful was the scene were the family hold their séance. when peter cries on hid dad's shoulder, I actually burst out laughing... I found it as cringeworthy as any of those cringy scenes you get in 'the office' at least there you're supposed to laugh. the exception, acting-wise, being G.B as the father. a great actor, he gave his usual fine performance, though his talent I thought, very much wasted on this.to sum up, and you've probably already guessed, not a fan. despite the trailers and other adverts, promising me something new and terrifying, I found nothing original here. the plot for the most part pretty generic and in places quite hackneyed. definitely a case, in my case, of don't believe the hype.",Hereditary

it gets deep into your skin, crawling slowly to your mind. There's no place for hope or rationality.

2449,remigoktas,So refreshing !!,8,17 June 2018,"First of all, I hate associating jumpscares to horror. To me, jumpscares are just horrible in the moment they happen and the true horror is the one that follows you even after you leave the theater. And OH MY I wasn't disappointed with this movie; It's not just like many other ""horror"" movies where it's a low budget story that is built in the only goal to put jumpscares. It's a horror movie but also a family drama so hard to watch sometimes but so fascinating at the same time. The performance is just phenomenal (some actors deserve an oscar for real). I actually don't know what to say except that when I left the theater, I felt like I never felt before. So if you hesitate to go watch the movie, don't expect to see some jumpscares happening in a middle of a wanna be story, it's way more but mostly, if you can, don't watch anything about the movie before go watch it, the less you know about the movie, the more you're going to appreciate it.",Hereditary

Don't expect to just see this movie and move on... you will need to do some thinking, you will need to do some research, and I feel this movie will be talked about for a very long time.

The plot is interesting enough to keep one hooked, the acting is excellent and adds to the overall 'off-ness' of the movie, and the disturbing scenes are truly disturbing to the core. But the movie succeeds the most in its vivid and unsettling cinematography and atmosphere.Highlights:
Toni Collette's bold acting following the infamous car scene (If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about)The infamous scene (paired with Alex Wolff's support) --Keeps you still in horror and shockThe ending which is simultaneously appalling and beautifulThis is a game-changing horror film full of complexities and subtleties scattered throughout and because of this, Hereditary is one that needs and deserves multiple viewings to fully grasp.",Hereditary
2456,admulders,Really disappointed,1,22 July 2018,"Granted, when you see all the superlatives in the reviews, you go into a viewing with perhaps inflated expectations. I have nothing against slow burning horror films, as long as at one point there will be a good payoff. Where a lot of other reviewers have stated that they experienced a constant state of dread, I rarely felt real fear. Rather, the first 3/4 of the movie did nothing but convey the emotion of bleakness, desolation and misery.The main catalyst for this bleakness is the character portrayed by Toni Collette. A wonderful actress, but this script has her continuously crying and feeling miserable, instead of feeling scared. This becomes so prevalent that it overshadows the sensation of fear you are supposed to be feeling. Yes, there are a few creepy moments in the first part of the movie, that will send a tingling down your spine, but they are too few and far in between. The one surprising death that other reviewers mention shouldn't come as a surprise at all, as one sees it coming a mile away if you have watched a medium amount of horror movies before.When we reached the last quarter of the movie, I had become so tired with the movie I was ready to walk out. I had signed up for horror, not drama. Then, all of a sudden the movie switches gears completely and goes 'paranormal activity' on you. It is completely unexpected and completely out of tone, but at that point it will be a welcome breath of fresh air. Most of the creepiness this movie was supposed to show is in that last part, and I really enjoyed it. It gave me at least a few good scares.Had the movie stopped there, for me it would have been a 6 out of 10. But the director decided to pull a 'return of the king' and the last 5 minutes culminate in the worst ending I have watched in recent history. 'The Open House' had similiar shenanigans and it triggered me to write my first ever review on Imdb. Let me tell you, that was oscar material compared to this mess. When you hear other people describe this movie negatively as 'art house', it is because the ending feels as if some film grad student wanted to showcase some idea to his friends, slapping his paying viewers in the face.My final advice then, to those of you who are still to go watch this, is to just quit watching at the right time. The cutoff point will be so painfully obvious, you cannot miss it. Do yourself a favor.",Hereditary

2467,taliastaden,A truly exceptional and jarring horror film that leaves quite the impression.,10,7 August 2018,"I was under the impression that I could no longer be truly frightened by a horror film. Especially those with supernatural themes. The last one I saw in the theater featuring demon-possession, Annabelle: Creation, was entertaining and exceeded my expectations, for sure. I was never really scared while watching it, though. It was fun but there was nothing...believable about that kind of horror to me.Walking into Hereditary, I was in a completely empty theater auditorium, and I had no clue what to expect. I'd heard a glowing review of the film from one of my favorite authors, Bret Easton Ellis, who insisted in an episode of his podcast that this was a horror film unlike the usual ones we get these days. It had really had an effect on him, and he had so much praise for it, so I knew I had to see it while it was still in theaters. I had very high hopes that I would finally be genuinely frightened by a horror film again, much like I was the first time I had seen Paranormal Activity in the theater as a teenager.Did Hereditary ever deliver.Thirty minutes into the film, I became tense; there was no telling where this film was going to go anymore. I felt uneasy, and realized my teeth were firmly clenched together. My anxiety was through the roof. I wanted to see what would happen next and I also hoped for a moment to relax and feel safe. The stunning cinematography and brilliant acting performances from the entire cast had me absolutely immersed in this horror story.Without giving away too much information - because you should absolutely see this film knowing little about it in order to experience its many surprises - this horror film is not typical in any way. Much like The Babadook, it draws parallels between supernatural events and the experience of mental illness and grief on a family. I feel that Hereditary surpasses The Babadook, however, in its much more effective storytelling and thrilling imagery. One thing you should know before seeing Hereditary is that there are many subtle, yet extremely important, pieces of information that make the conclusion a lot more comprehensible if you pick up on them. Paying close attention to detail is vital when viewing this film, and I very much look forward to viewing it a second time and noticing even more details that I possibly missed. I'm sure there were a few.I commend Ari Aster's artistry that went into creating one of the best horror films I have ever seen. He truly understands the horror genre and how to do it brilliantly. This being his first full-length film, I am highly anticipating his future work and I'll definitely be purchasing Hereditary when it is released on 4k Ultra HD. I imagine it will be a film I revisit many times, despite how utterly shaken I was after my first viewing. I highly recommend this film to fans of psychological horror; you will not be disappointed.Film Grade: A+",Hereditary

2469,roylegato,A waste of my precious time,10,26 June 2018,"It is hard to explain what emotional feelings I have been going through watching this movie just yesterday. As some other critics say correctly, it was all about waiting for something to happen, but ok, creating tension needs the audience to be more patient. This is not some action movie with thousands of bullets flying by your head from the first second. Having this said, I though ""well done"" as the movie itself seems to stand out of all other modern day horror movies. But some tiny bits and pieces starting to appear in the middle of the movie made me more sceptic and I was wondering if this one is not different than the other bad movies nowadays. Actually I was sad that it started to go in the direction I believed it would. Well, I am 47 yrs old, so, I have seen a lot to be ""experienced"" enough...
And it all came the way as I thought it would. And that was the point where I started to become real mad about wasting my money (once again) as well as my time. 
I wonder what this is all about nowadays. I felt like a lab rat that was used for experiments. Experiments of how much I can take psychologically. I felt like watching a movie from some totally sick creator. Is it just my opinion, or has the movie industry become more and more sick? Mentally ill people create mentally ill movies. The messages are ""the sicker, the better"". In the 80ies you had great horror movies, which also were cruel, but this one is based on creating a very sick environment which makes you nearly going crazy as you start questioning yourself what this is all about. This is not a masterpiece - this movie is simply sick and crazy.",Hereditary
2470,roylegato,Seen it twice and I now got it - a brilliant movie,10,13 July 2018,"When I saw the movie for the first time, my reaction at the end was the same as the whole audiences. WTF??? I was mainly disappointed and felt like I was wasting time and money. The movie left scars behind and I couldn't stay alone at home being that scarred for many days - which was kind of a good sign as I hardly get scarred watching horror movies nowadays (I am nearly 47 and grew up with all horror classics... I've ""seen them all..."").
As said, I was super angry having watched this movie. Yesterday, I went to the cinema with my 20 year old son as he wanted to see the movie with me. As loving father I agreed. This time I figured out what is truly going on in the movie! Caution - Spoiler !!:
The dear grandmom was a satanist. I knew that from the first time. Joanne, her ""girlfriend"" as well. I also got that one. But what was the electric impulse which you could see? This i figured out the second time. It was Paimon, the demon haunting the son of Annie. But Paimon needed the son to be dead first to be able to enter his body for good - which happenes just at the end of the movie when Peter jumpes out of the window. You can see Peter lying on the ground in front of the house when the electric impulse comes and enters Peters body. That was Paimon. Now Paimon has entered Peters body finally. The summoning was successful. And finally - Peter (now Paimon) makes that strange sound with his tongue, just like Charlie did before. Why? Charlie was the host of Paimon before. But her body was not healthy and it was a girls body, not the body of a man, which Paimon needed. Thats why Charlies grandmother wanted to her to be a boy instead of being a girl.
Makes sense now? 
And btw: Paimon is a real figure as well as the sign used in this film. It is one of the 72 demons from the Grimoire - some magic book also used by people like Aleister Crowley. 
Knowing that, the film has now become a real masterpiece. The tension increases constantly till the showdown at the end, when the movie suddenly becomes one of the most fearing horror movies I have ever seen.

(USA Today) The reviewers of this movie are either delusional, been paid off, or Ari Aster himself because there is absolutely NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE. No destination. A soulless automaton disguised as a profound mediation on: ""An unsettling look at the demons we have inherited from our parents."" (Vanity Fair)Wow, what a great one liner right? The things a talented filmmaker could've done with this simple seed of an idea, an idea that permeates, connects, and could've been a genre defining masterpiece but instead I was given:Paper thin characters. A plot that had no trajectory. Laughable performances from the whole cast. Horror imagery that served no purpose other than, this looks scary! Style over substance. Toni Colette, you've disappointed me dearly. Thought I was in for an Oscar Award Winning performance and what I was left with was a comedic rendition of what it truly means to be an artist. You talked about giving your soul into this character and all I saw was a performance with no intention. This is the same company (A24) that released ""It Comes At Night"" and ""The Witch,"" two other mediocre horror movies billed to be the scariest films of all time when they were released. It was one of the worst experiences I had in a theater and in film in general. People were in uproarious fits of laughter throughout the 2 HOUR RUNTIME for what was supposed to be:""Terrifying."" (Indiewire) and ""Bone-chilling"" (The Hollywood Reporter)Clearly Ari needs help with his storytelling skills. He has technical finesse, but technicality is nothing when compared to a story with nuance and insight, something that is emotionally compelling and moving. The movie had the depth of a puddle after a drizzle. The trailer is probably the best part of this movie. Watch the trailer and save yourself the money.P.S.

The cinematography, soundtrack and acting combine to create a sense of unease and confusion. You don't quite know (until the end) whether what's happening is part of an hereditary mental illness and/or a sense of grief and guilt - is it real or imagined? There are some truly horrifying and disturbing moments - but they are used sparingly, particularly in the first part of the film - and are more powerful because of this. In some ways it's a study of a dysfunctional family and repressed anger/hostility, but that makes it even more horrifying, because it's very much based in reality. However, if you've got a low concentration level or want your horror to be all jump scares and CGI then you may be disappointed. It's more arthouse than traditional Hollywood blockbuster, which I thought was a pleasant surprise. A few people walked out of the screening I went to, not sure whether it was because they found it too slow or whether they found it too tense (probably the former). I'd say don't read too much about it beforehand and just go with it.",Hereditary

2483,pault-40524,Overhyped nonsense,4,20 June 2018,"The trailer for this film is absolutely brilliant. It portrays what you believe will be the plot for the film - Odd looking girl inherits some kind of satanic force from her recently deceased and secretive grandmother, goes on the rampage in brilliantly horrific fashion , family are powerless to stop her.If only this were the case. The major unexpected twist is that we lose the odd looking creepy girl fairly early in the film. This was a great twist, it completely caught me off guard. 
At this point I'm genuinely interested and shocked and looking forward to whatever else may lay ahead, which turns out to be nothing more than another hour and half of confusing, boring ,unintentionally amusing, and sometimes annoying nothingness ,leading up to the most disappointing and ridiculous ending to a horror film that I've ever seen.I can't fault the acting, I think everyone played their roles well and is the only reason I gave this four stars.

2496,astrogoddess,Is this a 'horror' movie?,2,23 December 2018,"I'm not sure if Hereditary can be called a horror movie. Although there is plenty of gore, which often comes off as hilarious rather than horrifying, and many hints of supernatural events -- which, again, often come off as funny rather than eerie because of poor execution and lack of context -- I see Hereditary as an otherworldly family drama that fails to entertain.The title itself implies there is something wrong with this family. Ellen was surrounded by mentally ill people her entire life, Annie has repressed emotional issues and a sleepwalking disorder (NOT explained, but it's implied to be her mother's evil cult controlling her in her sleep), and Charlie...is a strange bird, pun intended for those of you who have already seen this. The IMDB poster shows Annie standing over Charlie to hint that it's the women in the family who harbor evil. It's later revealed that Ellen was the Queen of a cult, Annie was the interim -- the one would deliver the children Ellen needed to conjure King Paimon -- and Charlie was the catalyst whose death would break the family apart and allow King Paimon to take over Peter.I'll insert my critique as I try to explain this movie, which is extremely formulaic: a creepy event happens that's supposed to scare the audience (but never quite succeeds), followed by 20-odd minutes of boring filler. After the death of her mother, Annie is shaken. Charlie is sad, because she was connected to the grandmother; it's later explained by Annie that she was 'given' to Ellen, since Annie kept Ellen away from Peter. (There is a LOT in this movie that isn't explained, keep that in mind.) Ellen's grave is robbed, and for no reason Annie's husband literally has no f%cks to give and keeps it secret. Charlie goes into anaphylactic shock at a party; Peter drives her to the hospital, and she gets decapitated by a pole when she sticks her head out the window. Like father, like son: he also doesn't say a word, just lets his mom find her headless daughter the following day (nice family).Annie meets a woman named Joan at a grief counseling group. Joan convinces her to watch a seance where she talks to her 'grandson' who I read is actually Paimon. The sequence of events afterward aren't entirely clear to me, but at this point Paimon was already inside of Charlie and waiting to be transferred into Peter's body. Annie conducts a seance using Charlie's sketchbook, and for a minute Charlie seems to take over her body. Annie's husband sees all of this, and KNOWS that his mother-in-law's body is missing, but doesn't believe some freaky sh#t is going on. Peter is traumatized and hasn't said much since he accidentally killed his sister; he doesn't smoke weed anymore, even though that would probably help his anxiety.Peter is tormented by a weird beam of sparkling light (yes, really) partly controlled by the demonic cult led by his grandmother. Apparently, the sparkling beam of light is the form Paimon assumes when he isn't in a human body. Joan is revealed to be Ellen's wing-woman, which Annie learns about only after she finally goes through her mother's things. Yes, Annie and Ellen were estranged, but isn't it a BIT weird that Annie waited until the last 30 minutes to look at Ellen's belongings? There are also plenty of other dead ends...for example, WHY Charlie cut the head off of a pigeon and then drew it in her sketchbook...does this even matter for the story, or is it just creepy fodder to try and convince us that yes, we're watching a horror movie with a disturbed child who does disturbing horror movie things?Although he's pivotal to the plot, I don't know who Peter is as a character, since he barely has ANY lines and we receive no interiority about him. We don't get to see him interact with anyone but his mother and Charlie, whom he hardly speaks to. He had friends, but his throat conveniently closes up when he's around them. When he jumps out of the attic and kills himself, I couldn't care less that he died. When Annie uses two wires to cut off her own head, I was cringing and also kind of laughing because the CGI was really...bad. I didn't give a damn what happened to these people by the last twenty minutes. The naked cult members inside and around the house were also obvious creepy fodder to make the final scene more demented. The naked old men were extremely distracting and didn't scare me.Like many others, I thought the ending was an awful pay-off. The fact that Ellen's cult is so SMALL is a head scratcher and also implies that King Paimon isn't actually a threat. A dozen-odd people and a demon that's too stupid to know its own name or speak once inside Peter isn't...actually scary, because there's no tension. If we had ANY idea about the horrors Paimon can raise in a human body, maybe I would have been worried. Peter acts like a two-year-old at the end of the movie and I doubt he's going to bring about the apocalypse.",Hereditary

It's too ridiculous to be scary. 
The characters are downright annoying and the film drags up so long that I ended up rooting for the bad guys to finish them off so I could get on with my day.

It has plenty of creepy moments and imagery and some really good performances from the leads, particularly Toni Collette. I went into this movie knowing nothing about it and I found the twists and turns of the story pretty interesting, even though its not the most original horror movie story going.The biggest problem with this movie is that the pacing drags a bit towards the end. This movie would have worked really well if it was around 90 minutes long, but at 2 hours the pacing definitely doesn't feel consistent throughout. There's also a few really cheesy horror effects that don't really fit with the tone of the movie. I won't spoil what they are, but they're the kind of effects that would be right at home in some PG-13 jump scare movie like Paranormal Activity or Truth or Dare. Fortunately, there's not too many jump scares in Hereditary, and the movie relies mostly on tension and atmosphere for its scares.

However, the last 1/4 seems like they threw everything at the kitchen sink to make it a generic horror movie. Rituals, climbing on walls, flies coming out of the attic, book burning, satanist symbols, just the usual demon horror stuff.The biggest disapointment is that the storyline is weak and can be summarized in one sentence. Grandma is a Satanist and wants ""the king of hell"" Paimon, to possess the body of her grandson instead of her granddaughter.The movie doesn't really explain the lore or history of the demon nor the purpose of summoning him which would have given the plot more depth.

2553,flynnneal,A Future Horror Classic,10,9 April 2019,"A slow-burning horror that focuses on real-world themes such as family, guilt and grief. Pretty much every technical aspect of this film is flawless and unique, which creates an unbearably unsettling atmosphere for the entire duration of the film, it's deliberate pacing gives us time to delve deep into the psyche's of the characters, often to harrowing result, making us truly care about what's going on when things get spooky later on. Performances are round-the-board superb, of course plenty has already been said about Toni Collette's Oscar-worthy, yet criminally snubbed, turn as Annie.As for negatives, some of the teen's dialogue feels very trite and generic, which is odd considering how excellent it is everywhere else. I also feel like the film could do with tightening up just a tad around the second act, where I think things slow down just a tiny bit too much which temporarily takes away from the unbearable tension. The film can sometimes lay on the misery a bit thick to the point of it being borderline funny at points and I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. However, the finale, without spoilers, is so out of left field that it largely puts this issue into a different perspective and as such fixes it.All in all, a superb horror film that I believe will go down as a horror classic. My favourite from recent years and easily the most scared I've been in the cinema in a very long time. The standard movie-goer who likes their horror full of jump scares, predictable and easy to digest will likely be left confused and underwhelmed by this film, but for the true horror fan who can appreciate writing, character, technicality and atmosphere, this is sure to go down a treat.",Hereditary

Hereditary brings a new style of horror and does it in a unique way. I have watched many horror movies and pretty much any modern day horror movie that's been made sucks or lacks any real depth.

#The acting-
The acting was perfect. Al the characters showed their emotions in the best ways possible.#Storyline-
The movie is progressing very slow which I quite like when it comes to phycological horror movies. Everything was unexpected (like the death of Charlie for example)
#Scare-
The movie was very dark and scary not I a way of what you think, only if you saw this movie you understand what type of scare I'm talking about.There are a lot of good things that I can say about the movie but it would take me 4 pages to write it.I would recommend every horror fan to watch this movie!

2588,j-48518,HEREDITARY: A SCARE THAT LASTS BEYOND THE CLOSING CREDITS,9,24 January 2020,"Hereditary made its debut in January of 2018, leaving the audience stunned at the events that were witnessed. Directed by Ari Aster, this supernatural horror film captivates it's viewers psychologically, as well as disturbing many with the chilling scenes of gore.
After the passing of the families secretive and suspicious grandmother, it is clear from the start that something is off with the Graham family. We learn at the grandmother's funeral that her daughter, Annie (Toni Collete), did not particularly get along with her mother. Annie's mother, Ellen, always wanted a son, and that seems to be the main conflict in their relationship. Annie and her husband Steven (Gabriel Byrne) have two children together, Peter (Alex Wolff) (16) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro) (13). We learn at a support group meeting that Annie never let her mother near Peter, but did with her second child, Charlie. Charlie has never been the type of girl to fit in with others, and her mother Annie attributes this to Ellen being able to be a part of her life.
As the movie progresses, we learn that Ellen's grave has been dug up, which seems to be the first signs of sinister acts. The Graham family ends up facing another tragic loss, which creates tension specifically between Peter and Annie. The emotion portrayed by Aster leaves the audience shocked and connected to the family.
As the film goes on we get to dive deeper into the Graham family, making the normal family turn twisted with cults and demons. Although this might sound like an unreasonable story to believe, Aster brilliantly allows the story to progress slowly, causing all of the events to come together in the end in a bloody disturbing mess.
Toni Collete's performance as Annie added the emotions Hereditary needed to become a next level horror film, by adding extreme sadness and surprise, and of course adding the underlying feeling of a certain demise. Collete is also featured in The Sixth Sense, directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Critics agree that Hereditary captured Collete's acting in a truly unbelievable way, making her a vital part of the film.
Hereditary scored a rating of 89% from critics, and made $79.3 million in the box office. With the budget of $10 million, Aster highlights the use of angled shots and camera movements. From the beginning, this is evident when scenes jump quickly from night to day, as well as vice versa. Ari Aster uses pan shots to move throughout the room and add hidden messages or people in the background, making the viewers sit on the edge of their seats in anticipation. This style of filming allows the views to be totally emerged in the horror and disturbing events that build as the movie goes on.
Hereditary has the effect of giving the audience a scare that goes much beyond a simple horror movie. Aster has a similar effect in his 2019 movie Midsommer, where a group of American teens find themselves emerged in a Swedish cult. Hereditary relies greatly on eerie background music, but also creates the sense of terrifying silence. This plays with the audience's emotions, making the air feel charged with anticipation.
Although Hereditary was generally well liked, some critics believe the end of the movie was rushed and did not live up to expectations. With Hereditary lasting just over two hours, I believe that more time could have been spent bringing all of the events together creating a less confusing ending.
Overall, Hereditary definitely leaves viewers talking, which is exactly what a good horror film will do. The cult and demons engulfing this film add true horror physically and psychologically. But be warned, the lights in your bedroom may have to be left on for a few nights.",Hereditary

2596,sjazzkat,Okay I think I see what you did there,7,25 April 2020,"Spoilerzzz:Ari Aster captures death in a unique combination of jarring imagery and all the ridiculousness that one might expect in an exposition about a King of Hell. While other films like The Babadook explore grief in a pressure cooker, the story seems to let the more supernatural and odd aspects of both grief and death flow in stream-of-consciousness contortions.Aster depicts humans that make a stupid mistake (hard to believe this could happen, I know), which bring them face-to-face with the prospect of containing death itself instead of just trauma and grief. For those that need specifics and translation, this is the stupid decision to send a young girl to a party in the care of a teenage brother without an Epipen. More stupid scenarios have happened in real life and yes, siblings die in the care of each other all the time. The daughter also seemed disabled in some way (asking who would take care of her...good foreshadowing btw...and showing that she's socially disconnected).Aster seems to want the audience to have a fragment of the shock and disorientation that could occur in a string of traumatic events. He explores the coping mechanisms of shock (through the son mostly), denial of reality (through the mother mostly), and peacemaking and holding on to reality (through the father). While some of the character's reactions seem way over the top and even campy at times, I believe we might find examples of similar behavior in the face of actual traumatic experiences. One might say, I would never go to bed after decapitating my sibling, but it's not a normal circumstance and people have done weird af things when in extreme shock....which you would experience if you decapitated your sibling. Aster explores various triggers that go back to her death and depicts the trauma in a way I have not seen done so well. I'm not an expert in human behavior, but as a lat person I would think these scenarios are very plausible in many ways.I gave the review a lower rating because of some of the more campy devices Aster uses for shock and to create a feeling of how ridiculous our dealings with death might be. They still terrified me because of the anticipation he created, so it worked. For some, it made them laugh. And that too is a way to cope with tension that is hard to understand. I don't like that he made the purpose of the campy elements unclear, but the whole scenario seems to work to create a feeling of distrust in what the audience sees. Laughing in the face of death is also a human experience and maybe he wanted to give the audience a taste of what he considers the ridiculous pursuit of humans trying to process death. Something supernatural would probably look and feel dumb to us, because how would we understand it at first? The few times he does create a tone of veneration for how humans process death is so powerful, such as when the mother begs to sacrifice herself for her remaining family and when he presents the concept of royalty and patriarchal lineage. These are real ways that people cope with death. It might seem pointless or laughable or confusing, but isn't that the point? Different cultures and people process death and trauma in beautiful ways, but this is a horror film...so he mocks and shows the darkest shades he can conjure.",Hereditary
2597,aritroy-91491,Extremely Thrilling,9,18 May 2020,"Creepy beyond belief, ""Hereditary"" is one of those movies you shouldn't describe in detail, because if you do, it will not only ruin surprises but make the listener wonder if you saw the film or dreamed it. The movie sustains a throb of dread throughout its first 90 minutes, and its final 30 are off-the-rails in the best way. Writer/director Ari Aster structures the tale so that it's hard to be sure if the uncanny events you're seeing are real or figments of thge imaginations of the Graham family, a clan cursed both by Biblical bad luck and a genetic disposition towards various types of mental illness.Toni Colette stars as Annie Graham, an artist and mother who's coping with the death of her mother while trying to finish an exhibition of dioramas that appear to depict her own family's life and Annie's internal state. Alex Wolff is Annie's oldest child, Peter, a sad-eyed pothead drifting through life. Milly Shapiro plays Charlie, Peter's younger sister, a disturbed 13-year-old with the dead stare of a statue. Gabriel Bryne plays Annie's stoic, kindhearted husband Steve, who just wants the family to be happy and struggles to make peace. All are reeling from the death of the family matriarch, who we learn was anything but cuddly. The family is uncomfortable with frank displays of emotion, and with anything that might reveal their interiors to one another. Annie tells her husband that she's going off to the movies when she's really attending a grief management circle that meets in a church basement. Peter anesthetizes himself with marijuana.
If I give anything else away, it'll just be a huge spoiler for the audience to watch.
Overall it's a very thrilling, mind blowing and thoroughly researched film which is bound to keep you at the edge of your seats.
Not for the faint hearted.",Hereditary
2598,ikfajmcf,NOT what I expected from the scariest film EVER,3,21 October 2020,"I recently read that this has been given the number one spot of the scariest film EVER!! This was done scientifically, so I expected a lot.
We watch all 'good' budget horror flicks, so are aware of all types within the horror genre. I sat back and watched, waiting for my steady 50bpm heart rate to raise. An hour passes and i think it actually got lower. An other hour passes and with a yawn i say ""this is a slow burner"". Then within the last few minutes, everything happens. I feel my heart rate rise!!! Hold on..... this was because i started moving around looking for the remote to FINALLY switch it off. Was it a scare fest? Not for us as seasoned horror buffs. It was more of a bore fest!
We really couldn't see what all the hype was about. I only gave it three stars because of the amount of ants, which I absolutely hate!

2599,jhdmccloud,Depressing waste of time,1,4 November 2021,"This movie isn't scary. The only thing that makes it a horror is how bad it is. After 40 minutes the only slightly supernatural thing that's happened is a shadow of a 'ghost' in a corner. And this is supposed to be a supernatural psychological horror. It's more like a drama on how to be completely depressed by a miserable family and a deranged mother with a series of morbid events. The death of a particular character is supposed to be sad and shocking but is poorly done it comes across as almost comical. There is some good acting in places, but that doesn't save the tedious monotony of a story that doesn't make sense and doesn't seem to know where it's going. Only in the final 3 minutes does it reveal the supposed meaning behind the whole film - but it's just random, no reasonable 'clues' and no believable build up. Waste of time.",Hereditary

Toni Collette was average by her standards (not as good as 6th Sense) and Charlie was fine. Collette and Byrne had no chemistry so her performance seemed more over the top than it should've given the stark difference in energy between the 2 lead actors.A lot of the effects used (the wave of light effect, the CGI flies in the attic) seemed cheap and they nullified any potential for creepiness.

2629,jayrdillon,"If you are an intelligent film viewer and like horror, then you must see this",10,30 January 2019,"As a big fan of quality horror, I was eager to see this film after reading much of the critical hype. The problem with the horror genre is that it is extraordinarily difficult to make a really excellent horror film, one that truly disturbs your emotions on a visceral level. That's why most horror films rely on dumb cliches, loud screams and cheap scares that don't have any lasting impact. Really good, really terrifying horror films are few and far between, but when you find one for people like me it is like finding gold.For a variety of reasons I never got around to seeing Hereditary in the theater, but was happy to see it pop up on Prime Video. I went in with high expectations, and the film did not disappoint - at all. Hereditary is a remarkable credit to the genre and immediately and legitimately establishes itself as one of the all-time greats, right along with Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Jaws, The Babadook, The Innocents, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (yes, absolutely) and a handful of others. In many ways it takes horror to an entirely new level.After the credits rolled, and still in a state of semi-shock after watching this unbelievably gut-wrenching, emotionally draining and disturbingly terrifying film, I came to IMDB to read what I thought would be near-unanimous reviews echoing my enthusiasm. There are a lot of those reviews for certain, but what surprised me is that there seems to be an almost equal number of one-star user reviews from people who thought it was terrible. I am dumbfounded. Almost all of the negative reviews say it is either too slow or the story doesn't make sense. Based on what I have read, I think there are only two explanations:1. These people are part of a generation that expects instant satisfaction. They don't read books, and they don't appreciate anything that isn't instantly gratifying. It's a shame, really. To say that this film is slow-paced is simply ridiculous. The first half is some of the most intense and darkly disturbing scene setting and character introduction you will find in any film, and the second half is just one wildly terrifying scene after another right through the horrifying climax in the attic. And how can anyone who watched the film to its conclusion argue that the plot doesn't make sense? I'm not going to take the four paragraphs that would be necessary to explain it to you, but trust me when I tell you that while it is complex, the plot makes perfect sense on multiple levels, and if you don't enjoy supernatural or demonically spiritual concepts then you shouldn't be viewing a horror film in the first place.2. There is some kind of organized campaign actively out to sabotage this film, for whatever reason. Based on the quantity and similarity of the one-star reviews, and how they all are stacked together, I think there is something to this theory though I have no idea why anyone would want to keep a film like this from being successful. BTW, if that is what you are doing, you are too late. It's a huge hit.I'm not going to rehash all of the plot points because there is just too much going on in this film. Suffice to say that it hits many nerves related to underlying family strains, grief, loss, parent-child tension, spousal-tension, and dark insanity, and it unfolds them all in a frighteningly real and relatable way (to a point, obviously, before everything goes berserk). It's all very well done, and the direction from the miniature house perspective is a powerful visual effect. One of my main criticisms of a lot of horror films today is that they rely too much on a) cheap jump scares, and b) soundtracks that are like cue cards telling you when you should be scared. There are few if any jump scares in Hereditary, and while the marvelously creepy score cuts close to being overdone at points, in the end it works amazingly well to accentuate some of the scariest scenes while casting a pall of nervous dread throughout the entire film.Look, if you have the patience and intellectual capacity of a millennial teenager then you probably aren't going to enjoy this film. But if you enjoy well-crafted, well-written, well-acted and well-directed horror films such as any of the ones I listed above - films that expertly build a sickening sense of dread and that wrench your emotions in new and uncomfortable ways - you are not just going to like Hereditary; you are going to love it. It is a brilliant horror film, and I only wish there were more like it.",Hereditary
2630,miinarasanen,My favorite horror movie,9,23 August 2021,"This is the first horror movie that made me lose my sleep and made me feel uneasy after watching it, and I have watched millions of horror movies since I was young. There weren't necessarily any jumpscares or scary-looking creatures, but the naked cult members (especially the man who was smiling) REALLY creeped me out for some reason. Also, the cult theme, the family members slowly losing their mind, creepy things starting to slowly add up and especially the unsettling music throughout the movie made it even scarier. I love how there are many small but creepy details that probably not many are able to notice, especially during the first time watching the movie. I've seen it 3 times now and each time I still pick up some things that I hadn't noticed before.The reason why I would give it a 9/10, is because the pace of the movie was a little too slow.

2650,ericb101183,A flutter and deranged and nod to conjuring mediums worthy of The Divine Comedy,7,24 June 2018,"The protagonist of this movie is of a wiry pulse. The personality of this movie is distraught and cluttered with coping mechanisms. The plot is sound and presents inaccuracies that manifest as discovery of the king paimon of hell. The life size statue of Jesus wearing a crown is not one of thorns in this particular telekinetic, conjuring induced, ritual of the commencement of the order this king of hell. This triggers disconnect through inaccuracy as Jesus wears a crown of finished wood. The reality of the ritual is suggestive towards puppetry (as the statue of Jesus is a wooden puppet) through resurrection in the themes presented by the support group and the outcries of the struggling motherly spiritual medium. Down the rabbit hole a disconnected theme presents itself from individual and shared reality and their conflict with public and private behavioral approaches to normalcy in the foreshadowing of the mischievous qualities of the twisting primogeniture which redirects focus from the vengeance (unjustified as accidental with no malicious intent) of the daughter. This foreshadows the omen and establishes the mother as the responsible medium for the initiation of the conjuring of her deceased daughter. Though pressed in psychological intrigue, the kingly betrayal of Jesus and the deathly dimensions unlocked present conflict with the blissful and benevolent. The living disturbance is justified, the throne of hell is established in revealed ritual, and the shattering themes toward disorganized, unnerving circumstances in the genre are regressive, from a princely fault to a stable, sovereign posture. The struggle with acceptance, as in pregnancy story the mother shares and the father in his denial of the spiritual happenings and bold spousal diagnosis is of conflict with the ambiguity of safety and hair raising self and property destruction which unravels the audience to fright consistent with the genre. There are plays on centrism, scale, and wholesomeness which startle interest, and tangential cues of design (in particular architecture) which portray this loss and summoning in misled parenting masking as relief from separation anxiety. The theme is divine betrayal, the exactness of the response to this rooting is of belief and attributes only what a moviegoer expects from a fright and gateway to the dimension of the unchecked immaterial.",Hereditary

However, it is in your best interests to check those expectations at the door prior to viewing the film. Multiple outlets went as far as to tout this Ari Aster creation as the next 'Exorcist.' Not only is that level of expectation unfair to the product, but they were released in different eras of storytelling, and the plots are very different.There will never be another horror film created that will shock audiences as 'The Exorcist' did in 1973. It changed the face of horror, all of film, forever. To be fair, had this film been released in the 70's, we would see overwhelmed, frightened fans being rushed to emergency rooms in the same way as following the release of 'The Exorcist.' Yes, both films release demons from hell through possession, but they do so in entirely different ways.Which brings us to reason No. 2 to disregard pre-release comparisons: the level of 'scary' reported and, as a result, expected will take away from your experience. Is 'Hereditary' the scariest movie ever? Absolutely not. It's likely not even the scariest film of 2018. However, that should not give the impression that the film is not disturbingly scary. Aster mostly forgoes the cliche jump scares in favor of dementedly-unnerving events that will haunt your thoughts. Some moments so cleverly filmed that you may not even realize the level of frightening until sometime after viewing the film.If viewed without expectations, you will leave the theatre satisfied, with the knowledge that this can be considered as another fine example of the recent high-quality, uniquely-imagined independent horror story releases. The acting is top-notch, the production is near flawless, and, short of a few complaints with the presentation of the ending, the direction should excite everyone looking ahead to future genre films from Aster. Simply a must-see film.",Hereditary

2656,wlutz-4,I guess I was expecting a lot better....,5,21 June 2018,"I didn't know much of anything about the film before walking into the theater other than what the advertisements were saying that it was an instant horror classic....Well.... Meh.It's OK, but just so mediocre. I was very much in the mood for a good thriller, but all this film did was to make me appreciate Rosemary's Baby a whole lot more. What Roman Polanski did with that film is what this film desperately needs....much better pacing, a tighter script, and less cliched shot setups. Much like Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby, I kept waiting for a big payoff with Toni Collette's character...that horror shot Mia had when she looked inside the crib for the first time. Never happened here.This film tries. And, it's obvious what the filmmaker's inspiration and influences are. But, this film could and should have been so much better if placed in the hands of a more experienced director and a group of writers could have tightened up a slow moving plot. Too many choices made by the filmmaker in this piece do not deliver what could have been a taut psychological thriller. Instead, it plays like a nightmare where you wonder if the ending is going to be someone just waking up and dismissing all of it as a dream.Acting is not bad. Toni Collette does an excellent job in spite of the script they gave her. And, the mood and feel of the film is rather creepy. But, it could and should have been even more creepy. In the end, I fall into the camp who feels all of this was way oversold and overhyped. Shame.",Hereditary

2669,jonas_bri,My favorite horror film of all time.,10,13 June 2021,"This is my first ever review on IMDb, but I just felt like I had to say something about this movie to outweigh all the 1-star reviews. This movie is pure perfection for horror fanatics like myself. I've seen well over 2500 movies in my 30 year old life so far, and a lot of them are horror movies as that's definitely my favorite genre. This movie oozes of quality in every department, and I'm stunned that this is Ari Aster's debut feature. The first time I saw it, I barely slept for days because I was so traumatized, and that's the biggest compliment I can give a horror film. The story is well built, and you really feel for the characters when things unfold. I'm not going to go into any spoilers, 'cause I went into this blind, and it was quite the experience. The acting in this is just on another level. Toni Collette really should have won an Academy award for this. Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro were perfect as well, and Gabriel Byrne is on top of his game as always. The scares are few and far between in the first two thirds of the movie, and I can understand that it's off-putting for those who doesn't like slow burn horror, but good things come for those who wait. The last act is just pure insanity, and my god it's filled with horrifying imagery (as is that one scene in the middle of the movie, you know the one I'm talking about if you've watched it). I also have to talk about the sound design and score. My god what a haunting soundtrack this movie has, and all those creepy sound effects! The cinematography is also top notch. Many people seem to hate the ending to this movie, but I feel that it perfectly wraps up the story, and doesn't give too much away. It really is the perfect horror film for horror enthusiasts and movie enthusiasts in general. If you love horror, do yourself a favor and watch this one as soon as possible if you haven't already seen it, and if you have, rewatch it, because there's so much more you notice upon each rewatch. 10/10.",Hereditary

I had to move my seat because there was a dude behind me snoring so loudly. And what makes for ""good acting"", a lot of fake crying and hysterics? Ugh. Toni Collette was never so annoying. (There, I said it.) The only real interesting part of the movie was when she admitted she hated her son. (Toni's good here.) But it's the one good scene. And Gabriel Byrne has never been so aloof. I suspect his part was trimmed down because there's a hint that his character suspects his wife is crazy, but he was directed or edited to just shrug through the movie. And his demise was so telegraphed that I thought it would be at least graphically stunning when it happens, but, meh, the dude continued snoring in the back. Furthermore, the audience was so bored that they started clicking their tongues throughout the movie to amuse themselves. (A movie in-joke.) And at the end, laughter and hissing.

It's definitely one of those movies that you'll want to pay attention to everything to piece together what is happening. 8 stars for great performances, wonderful cinematography, genuinely scary imagery and awesomely tense moments; that being said, I do agree with other reviewers that the last 5 minutes left me feeling kinda... eh.

2680,geoff-lane-phd,"Calling this a ""horror"" movie is accurate, but doesn't quite capture it - It's emotional terrorism as a horror film",9,1 July 2018,"It's quite rare to see a movie as deeply and profoundly disturbing as this one. It calls to mind William Friedkin's lesser-known movie, ""Bug."" ""Bug"" had an interesting history - it was marketed as a horror film, but only because (I think) studios didn't have any other way of categorizing it and marketing it for the masses. Like this movie, it left me nearly speechless after it was over and kept replaying through my mind for days.Also like ""Bug,"" ""Hereditary"" doesn't primarily get the fuel for it's utterly disturbing qualities from the horror elements. The primary fuel - the stuff that will haunt you for days after you see it - it comes from this film's exploration of a family rotting away in front of us due to unrelenting tragedy and mental illness. Let's not mince words though - the horror elements are there in this film, and in a big way, including some moments of disturbing gore. Primarily (and in my view, fortunately), the director Ari Aster seems to prefer the ""Japanese style"" in his scares - things that are lurking in the shadows, just barely visible, and a huge emphasis on setting emotional tone and building suspense and tension. But - more than anything, the truly horrific elements of this film lie in their laserlike focus on the psychological. A scene that has not left me is the one where Charlie sits in his car after accidentally decapitating his sister, and the camera just lingers, watching the trauma unfold on his face, for what seems like an eternity of minutes..Throughout this movie, I had the experience of being repeatedly, psychologically battered and assaulted as the movie movies through to it's insane climax. In short, to sum up - ""Hereditary"" is cinematic emotional terrorism at it's finest, dressed up as a ""horror"" film. If you have a strong stomach and no pre-existing psychiatric issues, see this film. Don't blame me for what results.",Hereditary

Gabriel Byrne has been a crush of mine for decades. That being said, I wish I had saved my money. The writers should be ashamed. 
Halfway into this movie I was convinced that this was a piece about the devastation that mental illness can have on a family. We are given hints about the illness that runs in the line, such as Grandma's DID and Uncle's schizophrenia. As the movie continued and the ""visions"" occurred, I thought the big twisty reveal would be that daughter and grandson have mental illness, triggered by horrible accidents and the terrible repercussions of watching a loved one slip into dementia and die. But, shame on me for thinking this movie would be intelligent. The big reveal is a Satanic pact that turns the son into a vessel for a Demi-god or Demon?!? Screw you, guys.

The second, I saw more into it than the long intervalled borefest previously encountered. I appreciated Toni Colette for the first time ever in 18 movies. The rest, akin to dismal. I see that horror has taken a turn from frights to a disturbing circumstance that may happen in the house next door.I enjoy that. Unfortunately having next to zero plot with so much well done cinematography it stood on one foot, fighting off excitement with ""darkness and anticipation"". The fight being concluded with a shrug, delivered by boredom, and the referee, ""Slapdash Quickplot"", called it quits with a quick ending to an otherwise fruitless film. Toni Collette did well until now was not a fan. On a scale of one to ten I rate it a ""meh"".",Hereditary

2721,katiekat602,The Most Horrifying Film I've Ever Seen,10,8 June 2018,"This movie comes as close to perfect as any horror movie can. What was most surprising about this movie was the comedy. The actors were so skilled that your stomach would be turning with disgust one minute, and then suddenly the entire theatre is laughing at what often felt like a genuinely improvised line. Alex Wolff deserves all the praise he's been afforded so far for this movie, because even though he's a young actor, he stole the film through the second act. Toni Colett was astounding, to say the least. Unlike other reviewers, I actually found the ending surpremely appropriate. Having gone into this movie with no spoilers besides the trailer on a pre-opening viewing, I was one of many audience members in my theatre who literally ended up making commentary as the movie reel rolled, such was our disbelief. Every expectation I had was wrong, in the most disturbing, blood-curdling way possible. I normally hate when people talk in the theatre, but this movie was so disturbing and shocking to fresh viewers that it was a forgone conclusion. This is one of those films that you HAVE to talk about when you witness it. I recommend seeing it without any spoilers revealed, so you can really experience the horror of the storyline unfolding. Even though I'm an adult, I refused to sleep alone once I got home from Hereditary. A movie hasn't rattled me like that since seeing my very first horror movie at the age of 9, the original Friday the 13th. This film will follow you to your car, stay with you as you drive home with white knuckles and paranoia, and rest on your shoulders with a profound sense of unease once you eventually find yourself in the dark.

I was quite disappointed in the tone of the ending. The acting of Peter (now King Paimon) makes little sense to me. I would've expected a more victorious feel from Paimon now that he finally made it into a healthy male body. While Paimon was inhabiting Annie it behaved quite hysterical in its desire to reach Peter's body. While in Peter's body, Paimon comes across as perplexed and plain. Not what i would expect from a dark lord.Another thing that i didn't really understand was the background music. In the beginning is ominous and perpetually present even at times when it felt completely unnecessary, and after awhile i realized that it stopped. There was no more background music. I am not sure what i should make of it.

It's slow pace does not come off as an artistic choice - it is simply poorly written and needs a heavy touch of editing. It does a lot of telling rather than showing. The acting is terrifying in the worst sense. The characters are shallow and make it very difficult to care enough about them to sit through their personal drama. Worst of all: this film attempts to flip horror on its head by capping off minutes of suspense with...nothing. And it's absolutely refreshing the first time. A little less so the second. It simply becomes incredibly annoying by the third time around. There are certain rules that can only be broken if there is a valid reason to do so. If you build suspense and then break it off, you must leave the audience with a sense of further anticipation of something to come. But the film is not written well enough for anyone to care.

The plot doesn't follow any red line what so ever, and the first horror element occurs after 1 hr 50 m, and the next one 5 minutes before the end. You get 5 minutes of poorly directed, poorly animated, poorly acted semi-horror, which only makes you laugh at the irony of the entire movie. Seriously. After one hour of this I was so bored that I started slapping myself in the face just to keep entertained.

The acting and some of the cinematography was good tho, and the fast changing of day and night as result of no sleep was done well too - I'm not overall salty so credit where credit's due.Hereditary is just another example of the same story told a million times before, without adding any exciting new scare tactics or interesting views.

2755,person-400-719632,"Modern, intelligent, suspenseful, well acted with a great score",9,21 September 2018,"Hereditary is a solid family drama caught in a horrific chain of events. There is a sense of strangeness and dread in the sadness and grief this family experiences from the very beginning. The writer and director, Ari Aster, is at work immediately in setting the tone and providing clues to the story to follow.
Without relying on ""jump scare"" tactics, Hereditary moves more slowly than most horror genre films, providing time to think, time to get into the minds and hearts of the characters. There are plenty of surprises, but not the parade of techniques that most horror films use. This builds a relationship between the viewer and characters as the story unfolds and the tension builds. The score and the camera work are powerful in drawing the viewer into the family drama.
The actors are exceptional, especially Toni Colette as the mother, also Gabriel Byrne as the father and Alex Wolff as the brother. As the mother, Colette has many unsettling family issues to deal with from her mother to her daughter and she works, mostly alone, to try to understand and accept or fight against these for her own sake and for the sake of her family. This is a powerful performance, filled with grief, sadness, frustration, and horror. Wolff as the teenage brother also takes us with him on his terrible journey.
Viewers turned reviewers who do not appreciate the gradual process of unveiling the horrible events or the culmination thereof may not have paid attention as the film proceeded or may have wanted more jump scares, more blood, more dead teenagers and less thoughtful participation in the story. That is unfortunate because this film is not only intelligent, but more emotionally terrifying because we care about the characters.
Also, no spoiler, the ending, for me, was brilliant in how it wrapped up the package with a bloody bow that was both smart and spooky.",Hereditary

Well, apparently many don't work but some of us have one that works properly... I don't know how the laws are in the United States, but in my country if I accidentally kill my sister, decapitating her, I am quite sure that my life would be a complete disaster for several months due to the rigorous police investigations.However, nothing happens in this film, not a single mention of any investigation, no police, no detective, nothing at all...
The mother tries to burn the book and the sleeve of the shirt begins to burn. She tries to put out the fire in her shirt and she does not get it. Any human being with a pair of neurons takes off his shirt or looks for water, but no, she takes the book out of the fireplace and extinguishes the fire in the book. Nice logic...
Ok, for a moment I will continue the game and suppose that my neurons have died each and every one of them and therefore I can't think clearly and I will ignore those two facts.

While having watched the film halfway through, i thought about how thus-far, it could have been rated seven stars. It didn't find it that good, and certainly also not horribly bad, but because of the hype surrounding it, i was expecting a major upset from its ending. One that would leave everyone in awe, one that would be able to raise it's just slightly above averageness, to complete supremeness. Though the ending did upset, it did not in a good way.As people were leaving the cinema house, i heard voices of outrage and disbelieve éverywhere around me. It really felt like being part of a flock of victims of a dumb, but gigantic cinematic hoax. As if some kind of sick deal between movie critics was made, to lure a mass of moviegoers into expecting the next poltergeist, but to be then only getting served an even less than average movie.Very offensive and disappointing, to say the least. Before i went to see this film, and based on the lauding reviews, i expected it to maybe get an eight or even nine star rating from me. When i came home, i gave this film a sober six stars IMDb rating, but would i have let my anger over the perceived hoax influence my rating, i would have given it only two stars, and as i'm typing this i'm wondering if i should maybe overdo the earlier rating of six stars with only two stars, as to try to communicate to future potential viewers to stay away from this movie, which they also might want to see because of reading raving reviews.Honestly, i can still imagine me giving this film a seven, or even eight stars rating, if the damned ending wouldn't have been such an anti-climax.

However, the movie starts to fall apart in its second half: the filmmakers try to introduce elements that don't feel grounded or tied to anything else in the story, the scares are just silly, and even the performances are over the top and unbelievable. The audience I saw it with laughed the entire third act, myself included. It felt to me like someone in the writer's room would have an idea and they'd just throw it into the movie without bothering to explain why it matters. It was disjointed; it felt like a bunch of puzzle pieces that don't fit together. I know you can find videos 'explaining' the movie, and that there are connections that aren't evident on a first viewing; but Hereditary, in my opinion, didn't present a compelling enough story for me to *care* about those connections.

The film starts with promise, with some great imagery and acting that really capture the mood and imagination. Then really slows off into a sluggish pace taking forever to try and build some deep an meaningful character background. Unfortunately it ends up dragging out a poorly edited series of coincidences that don't work and just make the film predictable. Then in the final third it hits the wall and the story line descends into a mix of ""that's been done before"" and "" let's pick an idea randomly out if a hat"". I looked forward to this movie and was left completely bemused by how it could start with such promise and demise into the claptrap it ended up being. I understand why people want to give good ratings to this film but it only gets a 4 from me. I just hope it ends here and doesn't become a B movie franchise that the ending suggests.",Hereditary

When the movie started it was a little slow paced but enough to keep me interested but after about 45 minutes I started to lose interest and didn't care about the story or any of the characters. The only reason I didn't leave the theater was for the desperation of one good scare in the movie. At some point someone behind me took a phone call in the theater which I was more interested in than the movie. By the end of the movie with about 20 minutes until the end the movie sterted to get ''scary'' but at that point no one in the theater cared about the story anymore and began laughing and began laughing at the scariest parts in the movie including me and the two 8 year old behind me. By the end of the movie I heard the girl next to me say ""wtf was that"" as everyone ran out of the theater as fast as they could to avoid seeing that movie ever again. The only part that I felt was traumatizing or disturbing was the naked people at the end and how much people get paid to rate this so highly.

That being said I thought the pacing was a bit too deliberate at times which may have put off less patient viewers. This attention to detail also serves to elevate this film from instant and constant scarification, and makes the focus on elements that create tension. That's why I enjoyed this film. I've been around long enough to have seen the Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby and I don't feel that Hereditary is quite in that league. I don't know if people are angry because they thought this film was supposed to be that influential or because Hereditary used elements of those films. This film was a very effective film in that not only was it scary and horrifying, but a solid foundation was created, context, by which the horror operates. Rarely is a CGI monster scary. In fact, generally the more I see of the monster, the less scary it gets. So for me, the scariest stuff is in my head. A good horror film is every bit about plot, story line, characters, and tension building, as well as the ""monster or demon."" They are interdependent for a great film experience.",Hereditary

Hereditary excels at creating an environment that continuously makes your stomach churn. Most of the negative reviews for this title complain about the slow pace. The constant avalanche of odd interactions and world building are what set this movie apart from other horror flicks. You can just feel in your gut that something isn't right.A perfect example of this is the scene where Charlie meets her demise. She's coughing, struggling for air and writhing in the back seat while Peter is speeding home. She finally puts her head out of the window to force air down her closing windpipe when BAM. Her head is severed by a light pole. I distinctly remember the theaters audible gasp; you could cut the tension in the room with a knife. To top it all off, Alex Wolf puts on a phenomenal performance. He continues to drive home in complete shock from what just happened.Whats most amazing to me about this movie is that every bit of information means something. The amount of depth to Hereditary's story is unlike any other horror movie. Everything you learn about the characters and the world culminate into an absolutely terrifying ending.

At no time was I even mildly frightened and the scene with the little girl and the car was hilarious!! I wasn't the only one to think the film was tedious, I have never watched a film in a cinema with so much movement. People getting up and leaving for snacks or toilet breaks, people talking and the general shifting round that people do when they are trapped somewhere and bored waiting!! Normally this sort of behaviour would drive me nuts, but it gave me something interesting to watch.I will say the acting was brilliant, and I think the film would have been much better as a drama.I haven't seen the ending but a friend has watched it and I told her how I thought it ended and surprise surprise I was right!

2867,toozer1,I don't even like horror films!,9,17 July 2018,"Horror films are among my least favorite genres for a couple reasons: 1) They tend to follow the same generic formula time and time again; 2) I simply don't like the thrills of a horror movie. Not for me. I saw this movie because a friend of mine was interested and I had nothing better to do that night. I went, but I didn't realize it was going to be a horror film. Although I would never see it again for the sake of my own mental health, I can appreciate a great movie regardless of genre.The biggest applause of this movie easily goes to the writer/director, Ari Aster. Every line had a significant purpose, unlike so many movies today where half of the dialogue is simply to get a specific reaction from the audience, regardless of whether or not it makes sense or matters at all. This movie has the writing of a fantastic literary piece. No word is wasted, which is why there are frequent moments in the movie where there's no dialogue. In these moments, the visuals could easily carry this whole movie without a script of any kind.This is another place where the Aster shines. Angles and shots were filmed and chosen carefully. Something that goes to the wayside too often in movies these days is the importance of the camera's position. Every shot should confirm or reveal something about the setting and/or characters. In my opinion, each movie should get a few grace shots as not to set unrealistic expectations. However, it's so important for the camera to capture the mood.Speaking of mood, the lighting sets it perfectly. I don't think I've ever found myself so enthralled with a movie's lighting. I felt like at every turn I was looking over at my friend and praising the job that the team did with lights. It never felt awkward, out of place, or devoid of purpose. This is one of the most perfectly lit movies I've ever seen.On a final positive note, the acting is outstanding. The performances of the entire cast are worthy of their own 10 star reviews. Although Toni Collette was magnificent, I personally was blown away by Alex Wolff. I was very worried when I first realized he was in the movie. My natural reaction was, ""Ugh. Let's not have another Jumanji."" By the end of the film, I was tempted to give myself a few lashes for having doubted him. His emotions were on point and were some of the biggest contributors to the fear I experienced.One negative comment comes back to the writing a little bit. At times it felt like the movie didn't make much sense. The writing even felt sloppy. Upon further reflection during and after the movie, I realized how much everything made sense. However, one thing you don't want your viewers doing during your movie is wondering what in the world is going on.Other than this flaw, the movie is, dare I say, a wonderful work of art.",Hereditary

And now that I see this is rated at 7.7 on IMDB, I am super sure that one must not use IMDB rating as a measure. What are we talking about here? Horror? Thriller? Mystery? There is nothing... the man that should get all the credit is that person who made the trailer... because he has managed to make something that reflects 0% of the film.The plot is egregiously poor. Characters have literally no identity and the motives beyond most of their actions is so inorganic. Not to mention the so many side characters and side stories that have no function at all in the whole story. These flopped characters come across even worse given the very poor acting, specially in the role of the father (Gabriel Byrne), he is the most passive individual ever in a situation that one cannot understand how this could even be possible ! The mother is a joke too, i mean her character is just so bad but still a comical performance at times by Toni Collette. And that ending just sums it all up, like the most bizzare way to finalise a poorly written script that seems it was just a rough idea and was rushed into production. The directing is a laugh. The film has literally no moments of horror, thrill or excitement for the most part. What they have done is that they have tried to create the feeling of suspense simply by applying horrifying sounds on the scenes but the problem is .... nothing happens. The camera work, choices of frames is also so bad that you cannot even believe this is a film made in 2018. You cannot make a ""horror"" film by simply abusing audiovisual tools i.e. horror tones on every single scene where the character is simply walking from one room to another and nothing ever happens.My friend next to me said some lines that cracked the whole cinema... first he was like: man is this a documentary or what?

2895,benscathcart,"Captivating Story, Thrilling Scares",9,24 September 2018,"Short Version: 
Not for the faint hearted, fantastic acting and character development. Definitely a damn good horror.The Long Version:
After all the horror movies I've seen I gotta say, this one was the most terrifying and bone rattling. The spine tingling and muscle clenching superb movie is set in the life of a family where the matriarch had recently passed away and the mother is expected to provide and keep the family together. As the movie progresses the mother (played by the incredible Toni Collette) begins to spiral into insanity and delusion. And thus with the fall of the mother comes the fall of the family. The constant rush of fear and confusion keeps your heart beating fast the entire movie. With frequent jump scares and thrilling music which accompanies these scares, plus with the morbid and horrific gore and inhuman movements constant keeps your eyes glued to the screen out of fear. Ari Aster consistently develops the characters and continues a complex but understandable story line all while providing intense fear. He masterfully embraces the gruesome and chilling sensations of slasher horrors like ""Scream"", ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Saw"" while delivering squeamish supernatural spine tingling thrills from movies like ""The Conjuring"", ""Sinister"" and ""Insidious"" combining them in this concoction of out right fear and very, very enjoyable film. Each of the members of the family have significant relationships that embrace a fulfilling movie instead of just ""a haunted family"", they have personalities and interactions which grow and encourage the viewer to be inveseted in their character. It's refreshing in the Horror genre to see a movie which breaks away from the normal family structure and forces the viewer to worry and care for the family, especially with the presence of a mental disabled child it provokes this sense of care and respect for the family. And thus as the fear begins to climb and it reaches the climax the viewer is invested in the family and so as it breaks down and fear ravages them it's so much more scary. The father for me was the most disappointing character, he didn't bring much to the table and really just ended up being a ""filler"" character really only being a representation of a man being oppressed by a matriarch (which let's be real is very uncommon). So I guess I would summarize him as symbolic but unengaging. The son and the mother are most dynamic which is definitely Asters goal in this movie. As the fear increases their relationship deteriorates and their characters become more and more intriguing. By the end of the film each character has had their own personal journey and been tormented by the evil in their own way. 
The ending is interesting, unique, intelligent and finally settles after being so fricken scary. The morbid and creepy movie wraps up effectively and definitely, most definitely leaves your shaking in your boots. Scare Value: 5/5

The story, when there is one, is so disjointed and silly that it ruins the acting, resulting in a bunch of unnecessarily long slow pans and over the top histronics. Throw in an absolutely abysmal and distracting soundtrack and you have the makings of a major bomb. I'm truly hoping this one movie will put an end to the hype machine vs. reality conceit surrounding movies of this type, but I somehow doubt it.

2900,whinsch,I want 2+ hours of my life back,2,18 February 2019,"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the beginning was pretty good and (as others have noted) it didn't rely on constant jump scenes. The star actors really tried, but nobody could rescue a script this bad.So much else about the movie was horrible, but not in a true horror kind of way. Apparently the death of a child by decapitation is not even investigated by police and the parents somehow think it is OK that her brother simply drove home and went to bed. Then they are just driving around in the car the next day like nothing happened. Maybe they are just into upholstery soaked in their daughter's blood.In a movie that touches on mental health, there is not the slightest effort made in that direction at any time. Get a qualified counselor for the family after a mentally ill and manipulative matriarch's death? Nope! Get some serious help after your son accidentally kills his sister by decapitation? Who needs that? Report QUICKLY escalating bizarre of the mother's behavior on the heels of two family deaths? Nah! And on and on and on ad nauseum.The worst part is that after slogging my way through this swamp of a movie where all the characters are despicable, the ending managed to trump all the movies badness in a just a few minutes. The only way this ending would have worked is if we felt genuine sympathy for any of the characters.

This movie is not for people looking for a quick jump scare, it gets you invested and makes you wait with tension to see the characters develop and the plot unravel. Slow burn type horror movies have always been my favorite and Hereditary doesn't disappoint. It mixes the suspense of a psychological thriller and elements of demonic horror and gore to create something that will leave you breathless. In the scene when Charlie dies, I felt my heart stop and I had to take a minute to myself. The way the story went from slow motion to the fast paced morbid death of a character takes the audience by surprise. The acting was amazing and I got chills when the mother began screaming after witnessing her daughters body. The ending scene with the eerie loud music and demonic imagery gives the horror fans what they desire and leaves you feeling unsettled.

2909,djip-minderman-currylemo,Phenomenal,10,25 September 2018,"A good horror movie isn't supposed to be fun. It's meant to make the audience confront unpleasant concepts and emotions. Anything else isn't horror but a subgenre of fantasy, possibly with horror elements.
In this regard Hereditary stands as a horror movie solid enough to withstand the destruction of the Earth, alongside such classics as Cronenberg's ""The Fly"".A family collapses under the pressure of losing a family member in a fashion that is both realistic and entirely hideous. To those of us that have lived through similiar situations this is a heavy, nasty subject and to me at least this movie feels relatable in its dialogues and the emotions the characters go through. I can now point to this movie whenever I have to explain what it was like living in a family that's not sliding so much as cascading, brutally, down a downwards spiral, chipping and splintering all the way down.
Supernatural elements are then added.Both the supernatural elements as well the more fleshy gore are handled with solid pacing, timing and visual flare. Like the rest of the movie it all looks fantastic; effects used are mostly practical and look highly excellent, the set-design is great, the miniatures are top notch, first rate, all of it.This movie may not be for everyone, for one thing a lot of people don't want or need this gloomy sort of material, especially when they're watching a movie.
Other people just aren't adults.

Any scene involving death is more gross and gruesome than violent. Basically, not your typical horror movie.The cinematography decisions in the movie were wonderful. The camera moved at angles that contributed to the creepiness. Additionally, shots were angle so well to display setting and mood. The director made the movie run a little slow, but definitely added to the suspense. Made the viewers uncomfortable, which is definitely the direction I assumed the audience was supposed to be swayed.Lastly, the ending was so unexpected and there were so many twists in the movie that defied the audience expectations from trailers and such.The trailer made it seem very vanilla for a horror movie, just like a family being haunted that'd end in a false sense of security, but definitely defied those inferences.Despite my enjoyment, I hear mixed review from people.

We notice the effects as production rather than as in story, such as the built sets. The sounds were a good example of this noticeable quality, but the horror elements, staging, fear of strangers, were too shown to us.

The first 118 minutes were watchable, and pretty good. Then, pretentious director/writer Ari Aster decided he would use the last 9 minutes of his film to turn into what snooty film snobs call a ""masterpiece"". In which us normal, down-to-earth moviegoers refer to as ""utter garbage"". The story turns laughable, and along with it so do the special effects. I actually said out loud when the credits rolled, ""Wow! That was (insert expletive) AWFUL!"" So for all you math buffs out there, if you take those 118 minutes of good and divide it by the allotted runtime of 127 minutes, that would come out to 93% of a solid film.

2942,solojones07,Highly Recommend,9,13 January 2020,"Hereditary was Ari Aster's directorial debut in 2018, although this was not the first film of his I'd seen. This past summer I'd gone and watched Aster's recent Midsommar (2019) on a whim, with no idea as to what I was in for prior to viewing. In summary, I was blindsided but hooked. Coming into Hereditary I was prepared for a similar coaster ride of emotions and disgust as with Aster's film I'd seen before. Thankfully I was not disappointed. This film is packed with powerhouse performances by nearly every major player, primarily between Annie (Toni Collete) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro).A brief spoiler free synopsis of the film. After the recent passing of Annie's mother, her grieving family which includes her loyal husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) and their oldest son Peter (Alex Wolff) and daughter Charlie. They attempt to process and cope with their loss, although their efforts are further tested through continual tragic losses. At its core, Hereditary is a multi character study, primarily between Annie and her son Peter. As a whole, the plot was not difficult to follow for the first and second act. All the events occur for a reason, the family members themselves are responsible for the misfortunes of the family, a fact which becomes harder to accept once the supernatural elements came into effect.From a technical aspect Hereditary delivers such intentional works through the candid cinematography and subtle but effective lighting. Annie is an artist, whose work involves creating plastic miniatures of recent to far past events in her life in an attempt to cope with her otherwise volatile life events which consistently plague her. Several wide shots of the rooms reflect Annie's creations and at times they even lend in foreshadowing the events that followed. It was a creative reflection of the controlled plastic environment Annie would establish within her means to be mirrored with the uncontrollable nature of her life.The bulk of my processing post viewing this film, was the excellently crafted symbolism, storytelling and character development carried from scene to scene. There was not a moment I could recall of ever being bored, or prohibiting the experience for any reason. I needed to see what the direction of the first act would deliver. On the basis of watching the trailer for Hereditary alone, you expect to be greeted with typical mainstream horror movie trends. Thankfully, this film takes a departure from such conventionality that's been released in recent years. The events Annie and her family endure are horrific in nature, but in a relatable sense when discussing the tasks of overcoming grief and self inflicted guilt.I love a film that encourages a second viewing to further understand details not blatantly revealed through an initial viewing. There is so much to offer if given the time of day to analyze the scenes. The time given to understanding the true intent of the horror displayed, makes the payoff which kicks off the third act in a refreshingly satisfying experience. The ending delivers a tragic yet somehow relieving sendoff to this family we've been witnessing endure such suffering. Rather than portray death in the literal sense, their loss lies within a failure to depend and support each other as a family ideally should.I highly recommend this excellent film to anyone looking for more bang in their buck when it comes to horror flicks. Though this is not for the faint of heart, and is anything but a feel-good film. It almost feels wrong to call this horror alone, as it leans more alongside a well crafted drama. I look forward to seeing Ari Aster's future films.",Hereditary

2953,filo_chic,One of the best!!,9,16 September 2018,"This is my first review I've written for imdb but I had to show my appreciation for such a well thought out and superbly executed horror movie.One of the main reasons this movie was so impressive, was the great acting delivered by all cast members. The most outstanding being delivered by Toni Collette. Her different raw emotions, facial expressions and her commitment to the role absolutely made the movie. She was such an excellent casting choice that I couldn't see any other actor in that role. Every emotion she played as an actor, I felt as an audience member. Because of this movie I have a greater appreciation for Toni as an actor. The cinematography, creative scene changes, ominous score and the overall flow of the movie make for a haunting horror movie unlike any other. The dramatic scenes mixed in with the eerily spooky themes add to the anticipation of the movie climax. Admittedly the ending didn't do the movie justice but I was so impressed with the majority of the movie I was able to overlook the somewhat wanting ending. I cannot believe this movie flew under the radar in comparison to such horror movies as ""The Nun"" which doesn't even hold a candle to ""Hereditary"".

The movie had me hooked and interested in the beginning, but I increasingly became uninterested as the movie continued. They did a great job setting the tone and developing the characters. They centered the beginning on mental health and recovering from loss of family members, so I believe they should have stuck with a psychological horror/thriller. This movie is like watching two plots. Paganism and gods have no business being in this movie, and in reality it looked like an afterthought that was not well explained or linked to the beginning of the movie. I would've thoroughly enjoyed the movie if it chose to cover the mental health aspect or paganism and spirits, but the two together in this movie did not work. This movie became a 5 from a 9 because of that abrupt switch. It is only receiving a 5 because the beginning was well done, the characters were interesting, and the cinematography looked great.",Hereditary

Halfway through it's runtime the movie goes in a very familliar and dare I say: tropy direction and sadly it doesn't redeem itself again. Tony Collette has some very strong moments in the movie but she goes over the top - allmost cringeworthy so - in some other parts (you'll know it when you see it), so I don't think that Oscar is going to happen.

2959,Plasticsurgeonfromvermont,Hereditary is fully part of the intelligent horror cinema genre,10,9 June 2018,"""If you think horror movies are nothing more than gore, gratuitous violence, slashers slashing, and supernatural creatures wreaking havoc, think again; intelligent horror movies demonstrate that smart horror exists - and is really good to boot."" (Ranker.com) 
Hereditary shall not soon be forget by his viewers. It has everything an horror movie needs to conquer horror amateurs: gore; intense (and for most people unbearable) scenes of violence, disturbing corruption of man's artistic taste; scenes in which spectators are confronted to the view of dead animals, putrefied bodies and, moreover, naked rotten bodies. 
In addition to this masterly served-on-a-silver-tray violence, viewers get the chance to catch shivers when it comes to the part of spiritism experiences and the thrilling cult which practices those satanic rituals. With this many details wisely put through the entire film, it really felt like the movie was about a cult that had existed in real life. A24 added to Hereditary an artistic twist by making the mother (Toni Collette) a miniature artist, which fits really well the movie. In fact, those miniature rooms that the mother patiently builds and paints are meant to represent events of the movie or metaphorical, allegorical events that complete the sinister family history. 
During the first half of the movie, a teenage girl (Milly Shapiro) is always seen eating sugary treats, such as candies or chocolate bars. It may seem to be so because she is nervous about the lost of her grandmother, but with a further analysis, and by the end of the movie, it would be adequate to say that her thirst for sugar has a darker meaning... It looks like she was the incarnation of King Paimon, one of the Lords of Lucifer. It was mentioned in the movie that she never cried, even at her birth, and that her grandmother, who was an influent member of a spiritism cult, cared very much for her and was always looking upon her. It is a demonology fact that demons love sugar, so it would explain why she always eat sweets. An other explanation for her love of treats would be that she is, indeed, feeling nervous and anxious because of her grandma's death. This and her allergy to nuts would also give a promisingly purpose for her anaphylactic shock caused by her ingestion of a chocolate cake that contained macadamia nuts. 
The second half of the movie has more of a ""pestilential"" taste. It is the part of the movie when the spectators can get a close view of dead bodies, but also of bleeding and burned ones. 
All in all, the present movie features an altogether thrilling and sinister story that filthily evolves through his sinister scenes.",Hereditary

Toward the end it got a little cheesy but the story carried to the end. I personally am not scared of gore or those ""jump"" scenes and find them pathetic, this could have been a solid horror film if the characters were developed a little more. It would probably have been an amazing miniseries as well. However, we saw the attic, it was a wood house, if a person was engulfed in flames, how did the rest of the house not burn?",Hereditary
2961,sansatore,Definitely not a horror,4,18 June 2018,"When reading all these positive comments about how scary and tense this movie is, i got like ""wtf did i watch then??""
Guys..and chicks whatever, listen, do NOT expect a horror film. You will be disappointed. It's a two hour (too) long and mostly boring experience. The story is a cliche and adds absolutely nothing new, except being too boring compared to other ""demons here and there and everywhere"" movies. It could be categorized as a family-tragedy with some few disturbing pictures"" at its best.. but definitely not a horror. Lame and cliche ending fits perfect to the overall experience.

Really good acting. Some creepy scenes, definitely, but overall, if some of your film friends are referring to it as a 'slowburn' movie, that is an understatement. I would call it a 'slowbore' because it was really, really, really, really, really, boring. A few scenes, maybe 4, kinda woke me up a bit because they were creepy. Even with the big reveal at the end how it goes all witchcraft/prophecy I felt totally disconnected to the male character who becomes the main character all of a sudden, revealed in the last few minutes.
The reveal is definitely creepy, but I found myself scratching my head and promptly removing this movie from my collection as nothing I would ever watch more than twice! Mind you, the scene where she's crawling on the ceiling is probably the coolest and creepiest part. I'd say watch it once just for those scenes.",Hereditary

It was also stricking how the rooms of the home were in such likeness of the models she was constantly creating. The movie left me with two possible avenues of thought. Was there paronormal activity influenced by a cult in order to bring some lord of Hell into our worldly plain, or was everyone within the family, apart from the father, stricken with mental illness? It would be a tasteful twist if they were all just experiencing a form of schizophrenia and that it really was Hereditary.",Hereditary

Where Exorcist was ground breaking in so many ways and genuinely scary, Hereditory was slow and disjointed.The characters didn't really gel, the plot seemed to move from key moments with no further explanation, and remove main characters in the blink of eye and with no real context to it. The death of Charlie is one example, there isn't any aftermath considering how it happened? The Dad burning up, just what? and finally the mum cutting her own head off, then her body in the worship position, none of it made any sense.Its not the worst horror film I've ever seen, but for one that's supposed to play on your mind, this will only play on you mind because you wasted good money on it.",Hereditary

First off the director had a child character killed in a very gruesome and upsetting matter and then he crossed the line by showing that dead child's head decomposing on the street. Things only get worse from there as there are no positive moments found anywhere in the film, the ending was absolute nonsense, and the characters scream at each other for half of the film's screentime. I was so upset and distrubed by this movie that I never ever want to watch it again and it is severely nightmare inducing.

2975,snakehead-herozero,uncomfortably great,10,5 June 2020,"First and foremost, Hereditary does a magnificent job in causing the audience to assume that the crude events happening are based on (maternally inherited) schizophrenia, especially because the father, who is the only family member not to be a descendant of the maternal blood line, does not encounter anything supernatural at all. In addition, Annie's kin is described as highly
susceptible to mental diseases, including schiophrenia and depression. Throughout almost the entire movie I thought Aster was trying to emphasize the sometimes overlooked inheritance of mental disorders, or at least characteristics that lead to a probable development of such. I therefore enjoyed the use of Annie's modelling as a potential metaphor for her schizophrenia, because both - in her job and in her head - she creates concepts of life that more and more disengage from factual reality. When her husband writes a letter to assumably a doctor that roughly goes: ""my wife is developing symptoms of a ... (cut)"", I felt like the elephant in the room was finally mentioned within the dialogue, at least suggestively.
It is this emphasis in particular, plus the fact that the movie exemeplarily uses foreshadowing and therefore might make the audience think they can predict the entire plot, that made the ending come as an insane plot twist, since it reveals that all the creepy events are based on so much more than the fantasy of schizophrenics.
You need to watch this movie, and if you have, you should definitely watch it a second time to get certain references - a masterpiece!",Hereditary

It wasn't excellent and probably shouldn't have promised horror fans to be so terrifying in the first place. I found Hereditary to be good at instilling a feeling of long-term dread. I definitely felt that. The thing was besides a few jump scares, it wasn't scary. The ending was downright silly, reminding me of several other films in the horror genre of the last decade.

2991,sethcudd-12609,Donnie Darko Meets The Shining,9,23 June 2019,"This is probably the best addition to this genre in decades. It's old school scary, not like these new scary movies. It uses long scenes without cuts, camera angles, focus, etc. to create tension. The movie develops slowly, but that's why it's great. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. This unfolds more like a drama that is scary. The focus doesn't seem to be on being scary. The focus is on telling the story. It just so happens that the story is scary. It's a different kind of scary. It's very psychological in that it dives deep into what is scary. It doesn't use cheap jump-like scare. It's a long drawn out kind of scary. As a composer, I have to say that the film score to this movie truly sells the overall goal of this film. The whole movie is very well done. I'm puzzled by all the negative reviews. It must be one of those films you either love or you hate, which is often the sign of a great film.",Hereditary

2994,matthewwweaver,Horror done right,10,27 January 2020,"I have fallen in love with this movie and Toni Collette's performance. The best way I can describe this movie is an emotionally draining drama of a family and mother being ripped apart by grief and becoming victims of a cult. The movie starts with the death of a mother/grandmother which affects all the members of the family in different ways. The movie takes a sharp turn when a second (and shocking) death occurs. This is when the emotion kicks up. The portrayal of grief and the range of grief displayed for the duration of the film is stunning and sobering. This film has the most realistic take on the subject I have seen which speaks to the quality of this horror alone. Grief is the driver of the story, and I think that's what makes it so unnerving. There are some truely terrifying scenes in this movie, none of which are cheap gore or jump scares. The ending of the movie will probably come off as too bizarre for some, but I found the build up and sprinkled clues throughout to warrent it. Overall, very solid film that I have and will continue to watch repeatedly.",Hereditary

The dark atmosphere and uneasy feelings that you get from things like a child who mutilates dead animals or the uncanny valley of the life-like miniatures made it hard to look away and not be pulled in to this dreadful tale. Also the sound and music were spot on.Ari Aster has shown himself to be a powerful and resourceful director using lots of different methods to tell this crooked and misdirecting horror story. I wish I could watch it again for the first time.This may make me sound like a horrible person, but I feel really lucky that I was in the right mindset to watch this film. The bad reviews make me feel like I received something valuable that not everyone is going to get because I got to experience what the director wanted me to see the first time through. if you watch this movie and you are not invested. you are never going to get to watch it for the first time again because the ending will spoil that. And this movie is clearly a labor of love that doesn't come around very often. Especially for the actors. Toni Collete and Peter Wolf, particularly, gave us a piece of themselves on the screen. When the ending comes, it will look silly to you if you weren't ready to see what was coming. SPOILER A lot of people had an issue with all the nudity. These were not models, the nudity was not fun to look at. The thing is, devil worshipers and satanists are often naked for rituals. There are lots of reasons but the one that I recall the most is that it is a rejection of the original sin, the rejection of the application of shame to nakedness. The rejection of a penalty applied to mankind by God. In that sense, it is supposed to make you uncomfortable. And the normal human reaction to feeling uncomfortable is to detach. So there were people in the audience laughing. I felt the movie was slowly pulling you out of your comfort zone and that the pot was slowly and expertly brought to a boil.

3017,beadevoe,Uniquely Gorgeous Depiction of Grief & Loss,9,15 June 2018,"First, let me say: What a beautiful film! There are so many tiny (no pun intended) camera tricks and little details all over the place, sometimes your subconscious thinks it sees something that isn't actually there; making you question your own eyes.The incorporation of miniatures, as a type of framing device, allows the viewer to see multiple scenes, not only in a different (and very unique) way, but from the perspective of Toni Colette's character, Annie.The masterful use of dolly-shots, by panning across rooms in a very wide-and-straight manner, give us the feeling of looking at all of these real-life rooms in the home as if they were tiny, inside a dollhouse. The most insignificant details (such as thicker-than-normal trims on doors, and taller-than-normal wainscoting on walls) also give us the impression that the home and people we are watching are somehow smaller than us.The acting is terrific: There are some very raw, brutal emotions that our characters go through, and at one point I even felt a burning heat in my chest as I watched another character endure a crushing weight of grief. That's why I love movies: I want to feel something.Certainly, there are moments when it all becomes rather draining for us, and that will turn people away. However, this is a movie that is very much intending for you to feel uncomfortable! Empathy, quite frankly, is a skill that we learn in life, and, like anything else, empathy requires practice.There are some shots that, I felt, lingered a bit too long, almost as if the director was concerned that the audience wouldn't notice what was on-screen. I thought those should have been trimmed up. Some scenes (though very few) can drag a little too long. Towards the end, there were some over-the-top bits of more, I suppose, ""conventional"" horror tropes and behaviours, which were a bit silly. There are moments where I laughed out loud (such as when a character throws himself through a window, à la the Friday the 13th films). So, yes, some moments are silly.My advice?

Please don't waste your time on this movie.
I hope more people will downvote the movie, so nobody will make the mistake to think it might be actually worth watching if so many people voted and still it has a 7.5 rating.

I did not see it at all as a horro movie and very much so more a psychological thriller. The movie definitely has its moments of tension but many of them just seem to fall short of the true horror film delivery. 
The acting in the film was phenenonal except for the pathetic attempt of crying from Peter played by Alex Wolff. As for Toni Collete she takes charge and captivates you while on film.
The movie had such capability of being a breathe of fresh air in film but unfortunately A24 yet again managed to fabricate their false hope that they potray in all of their films. They simply attempt to be too artsy and leave it all up for interpretation. Just yet another lackluster and absurd ending from the production studio.

Started well with a slow sense of dread, but followed over the next two hours with increasingly implausible plot lurches at a snails pace to a distant third cousin of Rosemary's Baby ending you could see a mile off. A few early atmospheric touches but you had seen them all packed in the impressive trailer, not dragged out over the whole film and serving no narrative purpose. Any level of narrative cohesion, or plausibility were left at the door- didn't this family ever even just sit down and talk about things?

Kudos to the writers for doing their research on satanists and satanic gods. That's all pulled together. I personally know nothing about that field so that further ostracizes me from following the plot. However, after learning of her family's truly extensive mental health issues (which after watching the movie I'll say alleged mental health issues) it makes you wonder if the plot is deeper or better than just.....satanist. It does add to the ""is she losing her mind?"" factor, but all in all I suppose I was hoping for more explanation or a more clear synopsis.

3058,zachlikesvideogamez,Beautiful and smart horror/drama,10,23 June 2019,"""it's heartening to see so many new faces here today, I know my mom would be very touched and probably a little suspicious""PLOT: After the death of their secretive grandmother, a family experiences increasingly harrowing and demonic events that tie into their past.This movie is one of the only horror films that has scenes that have truly stuck with me and keep me up at night. I nearly wanted to leave the theater, and I mean that in the best way.It stars Toni Collette as Annie, Alex Wolff as Peter, Milly Shapiro as Charlie and Gabriel Byrne as Steve.This is a slow-burn film, it's not constant jump scares and non stop horror, instead what we get here is a family drama that slowly unravels into a terrifying nightmare of a horror film. It has beautiful cinematography and some incredibly disturbing and well written scenes. The film is also very complex and easy to watch over and over, it is also beneficial to watch it more than once since you'll see things you missed the first time!Toni Collete's performance as Annie was oscarworthy, and I wish she would've been nominated for best actress. Arguably one of the most scary and well acted scenes in the film is when she screams at Peter at the dinner table.
Her facial expressions just perfectly describe the horrors she goes through in this film.
The dream sequence with Annie and Peter is disturbing and I love how you can't tell if it's a dream until the end of it.Alex Wolff's performance as Peter is also incredibly well acted and super sad, I wish they included some of the deleted scenes such as the one where he asks if Steve also blames him for Charlie's death.The camera work is excellent and very atmospheric, my favorite shot was when the camera was upside down focusing on Annie running through the halls to Joan's apartment after finding out Joan's bond with Annie's mother.
The diorama shots and the very last shot are also really beautiful, it's amazing how sometimes the camera zooms into one of the diorama and it turns into the actual location.The film has a beautifully haunting score composed by Colin Stetson, it makes every scene feel even more bone chilling and scary. my favorite song in the film was the one at the very end in the attic called ""Reborn"", it fits the setting well and is chilling yet gorgeous.I was surprised and unnerved when Charlie died from getting hit by the pole in the film as everyone expected her to be there throughout the film. it was a super cool twist, and Peter's reaction to what just happened was incredibly realistic and I love how the shot lingers on his face for 30 seconds.It's also strange how chilling the scene when Peter is smoking weed with his friends is, it just feels very eerie.This film has a fantastic ending with the demon Paimon taking over Peter's body and going into the treehouse to find all of his followers bowing to him. And the entire ending was like a callback to the 1968 film ""Rosemary's Baby"", it also has similar vibes to the 2015 film The VVITCH, which also has some of the same producers.Over all it is a must see and one of the best Horror/Drama films I've ever seen and it will definitely be watched and analyzed a lot more by me, 5 out of 5 stars.

I actually turned more lights on and put on happy 80s music afterward to negate the skin crawling feeling!

Two of the most important plot elements appear too late: a random book in the attic with highlighted passage with some photos and A STUPID voiceover just before the end credits (SHOW, don't tell).

If there's one thing in common people who hated this film and people who loved it will have in common, its the performances. Everyone in the film does amazing work, especially Toni Collete, who is potentially Oscar worthy in Hereditary as a character with lots of built up emotion and issues due to her tragic family past. The film does a great job of keeping things unpredictable and provides utterly terrifying scares despite no use of single generic jump scare. It is both scary and disturbing making it hard to watch yet you never want to look away whilst the realistic themes of guilt, trauma and loss are just as affective and terrifying as the supernatural elements. All of this coupled with the great cinematography and direction make it easily the best horror film I've ever seen as well as one of the best ever made.",Hereditary

From the cinematography, to the writing, to the acting, this is an extremely well crafted horror/drama film. Ari Aster has managed to create a film that stays with you (especially when you are home alone at night) without having to rely on overused horror tropes. Milly Shapiro's portrayal of Charlie is chilling, but for me Toni Callete steals the show. There are two scenes in particular (one in her bedroom with her husband and one at a dinner table) that are some of the most authentic releases of raw emotion I have seen on film. The only real complaint I have is with an ending that seems over-explained. The clues throughout the story and the visuals of the ending were more than enough to convey what was happening without the dialogue.",Hereditary

3111,joeymnussbaum,A Film Student's Delight,10,19 September 2018,"A Film Student's DelightFirst, I am aware that this movie might not be enjoyable for all audiences. The subject matter is a little touchy and some of the shots can be deeply unsettling for those who have experienced any family tragedies, recent or otherwise. People of different tastes might find the pacing in particular to be a deterrent. One thing you should know before seeing this film is that it is a slow burn. It prioritizes the building of atmosphere and tension over producing jump scares and images of cool/scary looking monsters. Just to be clear, there's nothing wrong with jump scares or cool looking monsters. They can be great and memorable if they're done right. However, for those who don't find that kind of horror to their liking, you should consider this movie as a viable alternative.
Now, on to the fangirling. If you study cinema or consider yourself a movie aficionado, you would do well to watch this film. You would do even better to watch it twice. I find it nothing short of impressive how Ari Aster is able to convey so much information about his characters in the little, intimate scenes that pepper the movie's beginning. Quietly, deftly, he establishes plot points and motifs, foreshadowing events to come. The actors bring these scenes to uncanny life, imbuing them with a disturbing sense of believability. I would like to praise the work of Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro. They made the best of the screen time they were given. Their performances were subtle, appropriately restrained, and it makes me sad to think that they will be almost entirely overshadowed in future discussions about the film's acting cast by Toni Collette, although she fully deserves the praise given to her.The camera work was spellbinding (pun-intentional). The indoor shots of the house were especially haunting. I was surprised (and slightly intimidated) to find out how they achieved the doll house aesthetic for those scenes. For anyone wondering, they constructed the sets on a stage to achieve the zoomed out look. Honestly, I could be ordered to write a three page paper on this film by next Tuesday and I wouldn't even be mad. There's just so much to talk about and praise.
I don't normally leave reviews of movies online, especially not full blown novels like this, but my director's spirit wouldn't let me rest until I gave this film the commendation it deserved. Looking back on what I've written so far, I still feel like I should have said more.",Hereditary

I think it will go down as a classic with some memorable scenes I'm still thinking about. That being said, I do agree with the film's haters on the following:1. The marketing for the movie is over-hyped.
2. The marketing for the film was misleading to cater to the jump-scare teen crowd.
3. The middle of the film began to drag on a little, which is why I knocked a star off on my review.Without revealing anything, I'm not sure why there's a lot of hate for the film's ending other than it's somewhat non-traditional but also not unheard of in horror films, especially horror of the 70s. The mouth-breathers who gave the movie one star for being ""artsy-fartsy"" might be better off saving their money for the millionth Conjuring or Saw movie next time.",Hereditary
3121,josephdoolen,Does the job. Better than most. One of the scariest movies ever.,9,15 June 2018,"This film is incredibly well done and holds your interest all the way through. I found myself telling my date and myself that it is not real because I did not want her disturbed and thinking I was a weirdo for liking it. The family element is painful but realistic, the plot twists and turns, arriving at a grandiose place that could have been more fleshed out (figuratively, of course, the film gets shockingly graphic). That could have led to a longer play time to an already 2 hour movie. But Wolff's portrayal of the son character really wows in the film's second half, and Collette is basically Oscar-worthy, as unlikely as that eventuality playing out may be. Byrne grounds the insanity, providing levity in a movie that actually has plenty of it. I agree with Argento comparisons as the film gets crazy in true horror fashion, but the good script and the stellar acting makes the violence and thrills that much better and more disturbing. I would watch this again, I recommend you take a fellow weirdo. I'd also like a second look at the fantastical places the plot goes because by the end you are half in shock by this piece of art. And when you think about it, most of the violence is scarcely worse than primetime TV. The cinematography and execution make it unforgettable (tlock).",Hereditary

I love well made horror movies. Modern horror franchises are so boring and it is nice to see a genuine new take on the genre. Watching this for the first time by myself (in my comfortable chair at my computer), I was struck by the dread, foreboding, and overall unease Hereditary hits you with. From the beginning something is seriously wrong but you can't quite put your finger on it. And it gets worse and more intense and you still don't know what's wrong. Even without spooky events, everything begins to feel corrupted or altered. And in the last 25 minutes of the movie you get some release from the tension when the horror breaks out but the great thing this movie does is it doesn't give you full release. It holds a little bit back. I've never been gripped by a movie this way, especially a movie this long. It is a slow burn but with a great and unusual conclusion.",Hereditary

If you're after those thrills, you'll find more thrill on a kids roller coaster at most theme parks. Acting was good, plot was poor at best and it wanted to honestly be more than it was. It was hyped up much more than it was, and the hype was all it had going for it. My friend sitting next to me, fell asleep and people left before half the movie was over out of boredom.

The use of sound, or the lack thereof, makes scary scenes even more terrifying. The constant foreshadowing and the cryptic mythos behind the story make for an interesting take on the horror genre, rather than following typical genre traditions, while still including classic features like seances and devil worshiping. This was the first time in a very long while that a horror film genuinely scared me, even on my second viewing. I was also blown away by the smooth transitions throughout the film, such as the intro zoom into the doll house, and the scene where the mother becomes drenched in paint thinner while sleep walking over her sons bed.

For me personally It pushed me right to the brink of Irritation and boredom multiple times, You have to want to like this movie because if you dont 
these few and far between scares will not hold you attention. as for the last bit of the movie it has some of the most haunting imagery that will 
stick in you head for a long time. You should see this if you want something truly Unique and unsettling, But be ready to put in a little work staying focused when the movie doesnt really give you a lot to work with. Also the acting, cinematography, and set design were all amazing. One last thing I appreciated was how the movie is willing to let you miss a scare
or something creepy in the background so more observant viewers really feel rewarded it doesn't feel like its pandering and doing a close up shot on everything spooky. Its just like a nice little bonus for people really paying attention.",Hereditary

And I have to agree with the people who say it starts slow, but I loved the emotions I got while watching this.Scared sometimes, but just feeling this tension the entire movie made this even better. Maybe I'm just way too much getting into these kind of movies, but the moment a movie fails to suck me in, it's just not that good for me.If you like horror movies (and by that, I mean REALLY like horror movies), you will like this one as well! Don't let people who prefer silly jumpscare-horror movies hold you back from watching it.",Hereditary

3150,ryanenrandy,A genuine story - deserves to be treated genuine,8,9 June 2018,"I have not thought the direction of this review out beforehand, but I want to say a lot about this to people who have and haven't seen the movie yet. The title of my review is true, I went to a screening with the entire screening room filled. Don't even think about doing this, Go a few days later from when it starts to show... it will be worth it. People genuinely treated it like a comedy, the iconic clicking noise was made throughout and I dare to say 80-90% did not understand what happened during the movie as I spoke and overheard conversations of others afterwards. This movie is a genuine story being told, comparable (but not really) to dark (the German Netflix show) and split, which I'm sure you guys will have seen. The story takes a change before you can get a grip on it, but not a dramatic plot twist, although drama was not something this movie lacked. Another good recommendation is that you see this movie with low expectations, treat like it's a backyard movie because it deserves to be seen from that perspective as the quality stand out from major other horrors. One thing that can be considered one bigger question that I did miss in this movie, but I've only seen it once so far - and do appreciate that it does not have a cheesy profession of one of the main characters explaining it in their daily life - is why did the king possess in the first place? The intention is a little unclear to me. But it seems like an opportunity to build on for a next movie, we might see a little more of grandma, how Joan worked towards these moments etc. overall I enjoyed watching this movie a lot, heavily irritated by the uninterested, crowd who did not understand what was actually happening. So make sure you see it without too many people, do focus on the emotional and intelligent qualities and don't expect too much from it for the best effect. It's a good movie but you can be mislead. I'll write a more sophisticated review when I've seen it a second time and researched more about the king. I don't feel like this is worthy, consider it a check-list for the people who want to see it.",Hereditary

The photography is as stunning as well. Heavy use of symbolism and metaphors abound. giving this film several layers to the dark, tragic and foreboding atmosphere. Even the few usual jump scares are down played to give them a creepy,, longer lasting sense of dread instead of just a big boo.

I hated it.Toni Collete provides the most appalling performance by an actress since Laura Dern appeared in Inland Island. 
Her facial expressions range from overwrought to, uh, overwrought.There is no coherent plot.
What plot there is is a mishmash of familiar horror plots: Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, and many lesser movies of the genre like The Legacy. And Toni Collete is no Julie Christie or Mia Farrell.The music is manipulative and irritating. Special effects kinky and often provoked laughter in the audience. Gabriel Byrne is OK but probably is asking himself how he let himself be talked into acting in this terrible movie.Hereditary makes Gravity seem like a work of art.

I was in the theaters with a friend who thought it was the most boring movie she'd ever seen whereas I couldn't peel my eyes off the screen. The movie takes advantage of the human psyche in the best / worst way possible. I personally lost my mother, found her deceased at age 21 and every memory I had of that moment in terms of how I felt, is how I felt during this movie. I wasn't competely reliving it but I was empathizing with the characters of the movie in terms of the happenings. Combine that with the excellent acting of some of the cast and it's quite the movie. I took off some points because I liked the premise and execution of the movie but as it got further in, I disliked the story of it. Attempts at being a conventional horror movie are made at certain points and they just flop.If you relate to the characters in this movie, you'll understand why it's a masterpiece, if not, it's probably incredibly dull for you.",Hereditary
3179,korbiereadingservices,Truly shaken after seeing this.,10,27 June 2018,"To start with, I will avoid spoilers with this review. This film needs to be seen as cold as possible. 
I've rarely been compelled to write a review immediately after seeing a move but 'Hereditary' has changed that. I also know that the film is going to stay with me for quite some time. This is the best horror movie I have seen for sometime and the first contemporary horror movie that has made me feel tension, fear and dread in the way that I haven't experienced before. 'Don't Look Now' and 'The Exorcist' are not comparisons but they are movies that gave me the same sense of heightened anxiety as 'Hereditary' has just achieved.
The script is excellent, paired down dialogue - sometimes very little dialogue and first explores the psychological dynamics of family dysfunction. This is absolutely right because it makes the events that follow all the more powerful. Scenes are shot as if through a window or uses the environment as a stage which cleverly ties in the 'doll house' motif in which we are observers of action. 
The photography and lightening is excellent, beautiful at times and eerily effective in some moments. No jump scares, as a scene early on promises, just sustained tension in which we see something in the dark and continue to see it for a prolonged moment.
By the end of the first act, I admit to feeling slightly ill, stunned and without a clue as to where this was going next. By the start and end of the 2nd act I was able to identify some familiar horror territory but that is forgiven as by the 3rd act the tension had just been racked up to '11' and I was compelled to continue watching whilst physically wanting to leave the theatre. I loved it but I'm not so sure I can watch it again.
Quite shocked to see some reviews describe this as 'boring', 'laughable' (WTF!) and one reviewer commenting that it was terribly shot? It would be better to back up these criticisms? The DOP did a stunning job. 
This movie has done it's job in genuinely unsettling. It's under my skin and making it crawl. Go and see this without expectation or spoilers and experience it. I look forward to more from this director but I wonder if I can bear it.",Hereditary
3180,iajones-73136,"""Okay, this movie is perfect. Now how do we end it?!""",5,8 June 2018,"Oh Hollywood. You break my heart again.It is my fault you know, I am a sucker for those taglines you put on the movie posters or the previews. Hereditary had actually came and went from my normal theater when I saw the boast of ""This generation's exorcist."" Finding a secondary theater, I absolutely had to see what all the fuss was about. As usual, my hopes were pushed off a skyscraper.Most of this movie is perfect. A masterpiece as many claim. The cinematography is stunning, and combined with the sound design it creates an atmosphere that breeds anxiety. The subtle creep factor of the story stays with you consistently throughout. The horror franchises of today rely more and more on jump scares, Hereditary just freaks you out over and over again without such gimmicks. The acting was exceptional. Alex Wolff especially deserves any role he could ever want after his performance. I hope to see him in many more movies after this. The concept and story structure were amazing throughout as well. With mental health being so prevalent in the news lately, Hereditary portrays the realism of a family dealing with mental illness, grief, and dynamic family relationships.Unfortunately, all good things must end,and I do not believe anyone in the writer's room knew how to do that. Instead of continuing with the descent of the characters that had made the movie so strong, the climax, denouement, and resolution all opt for the same cliche Hollywood ending that a robot would have written. I was ready to bend the knee to this movie, to crown it the greatest horror movie I had ever seen. Instead, we get a ridiculous and laughable ending with its own silly crown.

3189,famekingdom,A gut-wrenching nightmare that's not for everyone,10,10 June 2018,"I really didn't know what to expect going in to see this film. I had seen the trailer and all of the good press for it, I adore Toni Collete, and I generally enjoy horror films. I left the theater with a pit in my stomach and came back the next day to see it again; this is a film that rewards multiple viewings.The film began rather predictably, in my opinion. However, the truly unexpected and disorienting end of the first act grabbed my attention and never let up from there. This film digs its hooks in deep and slowly drags you down into a pit of despair. There is a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel, but it isn't what you think. This is the first film in a while to keep me on my toes throughout its runtime, even if its plot isn't groundbreaking. The amazing performances, sublime cinematography, and outrageously outstanding sound design makes this film a real treat for anyone with a special affection for the medium.I've seen many compare this to The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, and I agree mostly with those comparisons. However, I also see this film as a distant relation to the original 1976 Carrie. Both films put family drama at the forefront and milk every ounce of dread from the truly hideous realities of familial cohabitation for what it's worth. What makes these films so stirring isn't jump scares, special FX, or ""payoffs"" to every tense scene they present; it is instead forefronting the all-to-real human tension and making the audience sit with it as uncomfortably as possible. The scenes that stick with me from Carrie aren't just her supernatural revenge at the prom, but the abuse from her mother and the gut-punching shower scene that opens the film. It's those moments of having to experience the very real ugliness of humanity that stir me and stay on my skin for days after seeing a film.My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece and will certainly be joining my list of all-time favorite horror films. However, it is definitely not for everyone. This is a film that's made to stand out to already-avid film fans with an appreciation for the format; those with short-attention spans and/or those accustomed to the mile-a-minute breakneck pace of most horror films won't enjoy this. I also think (and I'm going out on a limb here) that this is a film most readily accessible to those who have already experienced a major physical or existential loss or crisis in their life or are intimate with the feeling of being manipulated. There a lot of reports of people ""giggling"" during the film; I think some of this can be chalked up to the sheer discomfort this film causes, but I also think it may in some cases come from not being able to grasp the logic and affective phenomenon of grief that this film so accurately and exquisitely captures. This film is a meditation on themes of grief, family, manipulation, and ultimately a lack of control. This isn't a film like The Conjuring (which is also one of my favorites) that gives you more than enough ""cues"" to be scared during certain parts of the film; instead, this film relies on your attention to detail and your willingness to be devoured by its sinister textures.",Hereditary

Hereditary is painfully slow; we kept thinking it would eventually get better, but it never did. Little time is given to explaining certain important aspects of the story and there are gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity which do not push the story along or lend to any discovery. Quite possibly the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time. I'm still angry I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this mess.",Hereditary

There was a huge hype about this movie and i even read a review saying it was the next EXORCIST so i had huge expectations of this film but was really disappointed. They say people were walking out of this movie because it was scary but i think they were really walking out because it was Crap. Actors were great, but story line sucked big time. I genuinely feel ripped off i paid to go see this movie . Shows you the power of critics and the media, they really suck you in like they did me . Two thumbs down.",Hereditary

The only minutes that are horror in this movie are the last 5 minutes. I saved you nerves because you will actually see drama, that is not at all explained in trailer. In this film nothing really happens. This movie pulls ties from It Follows (2014) and Orphan (2009). It Follows for weird atmosphere that is Hereditary present all the time, but honestly without any function, and it much better functions in It Follows, and Orphan oh c'mon for freakish child that is much more of a stamp in Orphan than is anywhere in this senseless movie Hereditary. If you want to see good acting from Toni Collette see Madame and Miss You Already instead. Irony is at the end of projection I got as gift dvd The Monster (2016) movie from Bryan Bertino, and that movie is much better than Hereditary and it is real horror.

The horror is subtle, the turmoil within the characters provides this uneasy, uncomfortable feeling which is what you want, it's great. This only executes because the acting is excellent. Every scene with Alex Wolfe (the son) was made awesome just from his fantastic acting and the way he portrays the feeling. At the end, where it usually flops and depreciates the cool scary scenes the film might've had, Hereditary gives you a badass, intense conclusion which leaves you happy with the flim.

I won't lie there was a scene or two that took me by surprise and shocked me BUT this was not a scary film by any stretch. I do encourage people to go and see it, but don't expect to be scared.I laughed a lot throughout the film, so it was enjoyable to some extent, and tbh so did a lot of the audience and it was a pretty filled up cinema.

The movie took the traditional horror movie route, idley waiting jump scare to jump scare for the story to develop further. The two hour movie takes some time to unfold and understand exactly what's going on. With the soundtrack, plot, and dynamic of the film it feels like any other horror movie. But when the story does unfold ,and you connect the pieces, you can see the bizarre, goosebump inducing plot they wanted to get across. The character development is great though, as you feel the emotion and grief each family member bears in their insane time of stress. Surprises around every corner keep you on your toes.

I agree, Toni Collette gave an excellent performance, but for me, it was not enough to keep me riveted to the screen. The musical score was atmospheric enough, but I was waiting for something to happen. Sadly, I was mistaken. I found myself wandering and wondering when something was going to happen to tie the scenes together. A couple of scenes were a bit jumpy, though not altogether unexpected. Whereas most of the other scenes left my wondering why and what was the purpose of them. The movie limps along to the final scenes which seem to be rushed.

The severed head crawling with ants. This made me dizzy and nauseated and two people left the theatre due to it.

I went in believing the plot was going one way but it went in a completely opposite direction, there was nothing predictable about this movie besides maybe a few scares. I'd say its more mainstream than the witch but still retains an arthouse feel throughout. Creepy as hell, amazing acting, creepy score, beautifully directed.

The only thing that made Classic flicks like The Shining ,Exorcist movies Incomparable is the performances that escalated the 'scary factor' .Hereditary excels with Toni Collette's Spellbinding performance which makes it comparable with the Classics.
This movie is like a jigsaw puzzle scrambled all-over the entire running time of 105minutes, with lots and lots of Easter eggs, So pay attention to every single detail or otherwise you may not be unable to decipher it!!!
---------------------------------------------------------Spoilers ahead------------------------------------------------I am going to use double quotes """" for the Easter eggs that I noticed hidden all along the movie and also I tried to give my best possible explanation.
Hereditary- The movie starts off with funeral of The Grandmother of a family, The family members are as follows a deeply depressed Sleepwalking mother Annie(Toni Collette), A Responsible husband (Steve), A Drug addict teenager son (Peter) and a Completely weird acting daughter (Charlie). 
Soon the Family starts experiencing Supernatural weird thing happening around them, The Daughter along with her brother goes to a party gets choked by something unknown, end-up dead with her head bashed up on a post. The mother's grief grows further, finds out it was her son's fault ,Finds a way to communicate with her spiritual daughter which ultimately ends by her husband burned down alive to ashes and herself severing her own head. All this for what ??? 
""It has to be her, but not 'her', him"" this is the puzzles solution. Let me explain-
""The pendant"" that granny wore laying dead in her coffin, Toni collette has a similar one around her neck, and the post in which Charlie bashes her head has the exact symbol, Symbol of a cult that's primary motive is to bring the God of Mischief Paimon to a Human body. The Granny with her cult group, the Mysterious guy smiling at the Funeral, The Solacing lady (Joan) , and others performed witchcraft, so that the 2nd child would be ""Paimon-(a male God Possess only male body)"" but it happens to be a girl (Charlie), That's why Charlie says"" Granny always wanted me to be a boy"". Any way the Granny breast feeds her(Grand daughter) for the big event(A part of Witch craft I Presume), Soon after her death the proceedings begin, the girls chokes for breath ending up her head completely bashed up by the Cult Symbol engraved post. The solacing lady tricks Annie to perform a witchcraft that will draw the Charlie's (Paimon) spirit towards Peter's body to posses it. Sooner Annie finds out that she got tricked and finds out what's going wrong tries to stay away from Peter to protect him, But it happens anyway- she severs her own head to make the final sacrifice, as soon as peter falls out of the window , Charlie's (Paimon's) spirit possess his body. The phrases uttered by Joan ""You didn't kill her"" & ""She is not gone"" obviously makes sense. The Cult members and the sacrificed bodies kneel before him to be crowned as the King.""Hail Paimon!!!!""

Jaws was more suspenseful than this. this film to me was worse than ""The Blair Witch"" the old 3D film 'The Amityville Horror"" was better than this.

3252,johncedge,I'm giving it 1/10 because I can't give it a zero,1,24 June 2018,"This is my first ever review but I felt so strongly about abonination that I set up an account to warn others. I struggle to understand how anyone can score this as 9 or 10 out of 10. It is by far one of the worst films I've seen in some time, and that's saying something. Waiting to pay for parking as we left the cinema several people commented that they felt robbed having actually paid money to lose 2 hours of their lives that they'll never get back.
It markets itself as a horror despite not being remotely scary, in fact the supposed horror moments, all crammed into the last 20 minutes, play out like a pile of badly cobbled together cliches. It's as if the writers and director suddenly realised by the third act ""oh damn this was meant to be a horror"" and threw in some pathetic attempts at scares. To sum it up in the words of Blackadder it starts poor, peters off in the middle and the less said about the end the better. However, in this case, the end is worth mentioning as it goes about explaining itself and actually caused a few people to laugh in the cinema, it really was THAT BAD.
The acting part? Collette does a decent turn as someone in grief and possibly losing her marbles, Byrne looks bored by it all and is perhaps just short of a few quid so he took the role and the young lad who plays the son could quite easily have been replaced by a cardboard cut out and saved on the wages.
Good parts? There were a couple, the background music was classic horror chill but its just a shame that nothing remotely horrific or chilling happened. ****SPOILER ALERT****** The scene where the daughter loses her head (by this point I wish I had) was nicely done and caused a fair few jumps sadly the next couple of minutes of pure stupidity, on the part of the writers/director, totally ruined the scene. Additionally there were a couple (as in 2) scenes where apparitions of the departed were seen in the dark corner of the room and these were genuinely a little creepy but unfortunately a combined 10 seconds is not enough to save the next 2 hours of total tosh. This really leaves me with just the last few minutes. I think the director must have a few too many to drink and suddenly decided ""I know what we need, a few random naked people"" for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Incidentally, for those who are partial to a bit of on screen nudity, there really wasn't anything pleasant to see.
Do yourselves a favour and wait until this badly polished turd makes it onto TV or Netflix then you can sit through it and laugh your backsides off at people like me who actually paid money to watch this in the cinema.",Hereditary
3253,wcchui,Masterpiece of mise-en-scène and well encoded mythological symbols,9,24 June 2018,"A absolutely well directed film in terms of everything, couldn't find much to blame with. Although this may not be a good film for passive audience. Negative comments in majority focused on its script being slow-paced and boring. With out a doubt Hereditary does not include huge dynamics and dramatic scenes, but it is absolutely saturated in terms of how many message and symbols are encrypted through mise-en-scène. Not defending the director but slow paced storyline and editing does serve a purpose to give audience enough time to read all these rich informations in the background. One of the biggest different between films made before and after the French New Wave is about editing which construct the pacing of the film. Never wanted to use the word ""spoiled"", but just failed to find another word to describe audience being extremely passive after quick editing started to happen in cinema. Comments of this film being hugely differed hugely by that person being in a passive role, or an active role who constantly decode its mise-en-scène. This film have so many information told by props and sound which demands some time to think and process. Would like to see audience going back to the cinema, watch it again but this time try to be active when there is no dialogue.Cinematography is absolutely stunning if anyone have studied cinematography and photography. As a example of mise-en-scene being extremely important in this film, models made by Annie (Toni Collette) in the very beginning of Hereditary served as a metaphor to hint audience that the whole stories and the fate of this family is entirely controlled by higher dimension which explained the first scene that audience perceived as a transition to model house to reality, but at the end of the story we are able to find out that it hinted that there is a evil that have observed them and manipulated everything so easily just like how Annie have entire control on how she wanted her artworks to look like. There are a lot of articles that have already gone through these hidden messages, I believe reading these articles online may help understanding and to appreciate the film more.One more thing is that I think that the ending of this movie deserve more appreciation and credits, not only twisted the whole storyline, create fear through Annie cutting her own neck, but also criticised patriarchy in religious especially in the bible. Being born as a female is so wrong that they have to kill Charlie but Paimon dosen't mind staying in a female body or at least it didn't try to kill itself in Charlie's body but other female followers just assumed that it is not right. Also it is interesting to see the Christianity being challenged by hinting that Christ is the king of devils/demons and this is also mentioned in some censored part of the Holy Bible.Cinema worth.",Hereditary
3254,dcswhill,Good fun fick,7,24 June 2018,I enjoyed this for the most part. I heard early on about the unrealistic advertising so I waited until close to the end of the film's run. The best scene for me was the ending scenes. From the time the son wakes up till the king is crowned was awesome. It was very long in parts and the death of the father was the best example of a way too drawn out scene. The only other item keeping me from upping this movie's rating was the mother. I just cringed when the actress started on one of her long rants. I can't pin point if it was the actual actress or the writer but she was terrible.,Hereditary

I hope that the man or men responsible for this never get work again. This is what I would hope qualifies as a career killer, because I wish I had slept instead of going to this movie.

They are either been paid or this is the first time they have seen a horror movie or any movie. This movie is not a horror or even a thriller.

3261,kimberlyharris-80466,"Terrible, terrible movie",1,26 June 2018,"How this is highly rated I have no idea. I went in not knowing much about this movie, as I do with a lot of movies I watch. I didn't read any reviews or know about the hype. All I saw was a Metacritic score of 85 (now 87, again I have no idea how that happened) so I figured it would at least be enjoyable. How wrong was I. I'm convinced all those glowing reviews from paid critics are just that, paid reviews. Which reinforces my belief that paid critic reviews, be they good or bad, really can't be trusted and that's why I barely, if ever, read them. That's why I tend to read user reviews to get a feel for a movie/show/game/whatever. This time however, I have to strongly disagree with these high user reviews. I don't know what movie they watched but it certainly wasn't the one that I watched. The first 45 mins are so were pretty good and I thought it was a decent build up, even if a bit slow. After a certain major incident, it takes a hard nose dive into the pavement. I thought the acting overall was good and the music and cinematography were good. That's where the buck stops. That alone is not enough to make a movie good. The story was so bland and poorly constructed that I thought it may have been put together last minute. Especially that ending. Honestly, wtf was that rushed and slapstick ending?? Did they forget what type of movie they wanted to make and suddenly remembered this was supposed to be a horror so threw that crap together? I remember dozing off a few times especially near the end and woke up and was wondering what movie was I watching now because it couldn't have been the movie that I thought I paid for. It was so random. The story just goes nowhere and it goes nowhere for a long time. At least 30 minutes could have been cut from the movie that had no point to the story and maybe it would not have been so bad. I felt every one of those seconds ticking by and just wanted it to end. I don't mind a slow burn if there is a good payoff. However this movie was a slow burn with 0 payoff. I have never watched a movie what an ending as bad as this. It's like they tried to take elements from Rosemary's Baby but did a terrible job at. I saw a lot of people who liked the movie, for some reason, say it was the best horror from the past decade or that the general public can't appreciate a ""good horror movie"" and they aren't ""smart"" enough to get it because they expect jump-scares. Wrong on all accounts. If this movie is all it takes for those people to sing its praises despite it being a terrible, stupid movie, then there is truly no hope for the horror genre. Everyone's standards are collectively lowered if this type of movie is being given so much undeserved praise. The only reason I didn't get up and demand my money back is because AMC was running a special of 2000 bonus points for buying a ticket during opening weekend so I basically got my money back anyway. The scariest thing about this whole movie? Sitting through and watching it until the end. Reality is truly horrific. I wouldn't recommend it. Go play something, take a walk, play with your pets, have fun with your family, watch paint dry. Do anything but waste your time and money on this movie.",Hereditary

Great movie if you're a fan of snail paced plots, 10 minute long scenes of two people walking down a hallway whilst one cries ""please"" over and over and over, and ending that leave you sitting in your seat, laughing in utter disbelief that someone thought that was a decent way to end a $10m production.",Hereditary

I was initially excited to see this film due to the hype and I love a good horror movie that will make me want to sleep with lights on. But my word, spare yourself the two hours or leave 20 minutes before the end and imagine your own ending. The film started off like it was a slow burning horror movie that had the potential to be great, credit where credit is due.. the acting was good. The characters were not delved into at all which leads me to the first stage of confusion. To add insult to injury they killed off the main character and the cherry on top was the laughable ending. This slow burner went nowhere. Too many thin plot lines that left the cinema theatre confused and cracking jokes. The ending.... what was that?! I've seen scarier jobbies in my toilet. It was like the directors thought screw it let's just throw this in. Everyone was laughing. I'm gutted at the false advertising. Watch the trailer and that's all the decent bits all in a lovely 2 minutes. I missed probably the only day of summer in Scotland to see this diarrhoea.

3280,ronskie-12271,No substance no quality,3,30 June 2018,"Back from cinema with the film fresh in my mind, It's late now and I am tired so a short review. First off how this has a 7.7 at time of writing I have no idea. The film is really long and slow, so slow that it almost drags to a stop, close up camera shots of anguish and pain on faces linger way too long, which shows up in even more detail the rather over the top acting in it at times, especially from main female actor who pulls so many faces in it it was almost cringe worthy, despite her being a decent actress I felt she over acted a lot here. The art of acting is not looking like your acting and she failed completely, you could almost see the cogs go round in her head. Film was at least 20/25 mins too long. Pacing was all over the place, too many painfully slow scrolling panning in shots from the sides that took an eternity to get to the main subject. Plot was thin, very thin . There's a good 90 minute film in there somewhere but opportunity wasted. I actually laughed at least 6 times, which isn't good considering it's a serious horror film. Hammy, cheesy nonsense. Only reason I give it a 3 out of ten is it had some good ideas and some scenes I hadn't seen before did in a slightly differnet way from other horror films I have seen, but for me I couldn't wait till the end and was actually thinking of leaving the cinema an hour in. Silly boring film. I don't mind slow moving films that build tension but this had no tension and no payoffs for the long waits. No horror either, more a drama with some horror thrown in. Why they killed off the weird daughter early on is beyond me and the ending is cheesy hammy nonsense. Best avoided completely.",Hereditary

And I was surrounded by idiot youngsters that had no idea how to behave during this movie. So instead they ended up snickering, laughing, giggling throughout the movie which climaxed in two horrible moments. The one dramatic scene with the young boy Peter in class ended up receiving a huge laughter, it took out all the suspense I had during that moment. The other moment, was during a slow-moving scene towards the end, some guy in the cinema thought it was funny to shout ""BOO!"" because he was too immature to watch a movie like this.And therein lies the big problem with this movie.

So, yeah, I understand I ended up in a crowd like that, too dumb to realize they should have watched Truth or Dare instead. So they could have had their little jumpscares, idiots.So kiddos, if you don't like slow, beautifully sculpted cinematography with lots of slow moving tension, if you don't like to use your brain and you don't like to sit still. And you only go out to horror movies to woo your GF, please go watch something Blumhouse related. Or go to the ballpit in McDonalds for all I care.

3298,gribzeus,Laugh-Inducing Failure of a Movie,1,9 July 2018,"I don't typically write on things like this, but this movie was so disappointingly ridiculous I actually made an account on IMDb just to share how utterly terrible this movie was. I can't sit through a basic, low rated horror film without closing my eyes. So, when I was peer pressured into going, I thought it would be my worst nightmare. Instead of having my normal reaction, I was actually laughing at the ludicrous scenarios that were playing. I wasted my money on a film that, as far as I'm concerned, I couldn't even describe what had happened after I'd finish the movie. It seemed like it moved so slow that the audience got bored before it was half way done. Enough with the 'artsy' movies. Let horror be horror. This was a movie that was hyped to be the best horror movie in years, but turned out to be a disastrous cluster of unfortunate events, leading to a garbage-fire ending.Please don't waste your money on this movie!",Hereditary

I was expecting a horror film"". My girlfriend felt the same and my first words to her once the lights came on were, ""I'm sorry"". My second thought was to ask for my money back. I simply cannot believe all those who say this film is scary in any way. I am not saying this to be flippant....I am sincere. It was not scary in the least, and actually laughable in parts. It had every cliche known to fright films, and I found the acting of the leading lady to be over the top so much as to be unbelievable. If all those who are so frightened by this film are sincere, and were really that scared.....how do they deal with life?",Hereditary

It's really a slow burn but the third act does not disappoint. The movie is very dark and mysterious which leads to very interesting discussions and theories.

3307,smycus,Looking for a good horror? Look elsewhere...,4,25 August 2018,"Please excuse possible linguistic imperfections but English is not my mother tongue.When it comes to the movie -it doesn't deserve 1-star rating. Come on, 1-star reviewers - how many movies have you watched during your lifetime to state 'it's the worst movie ever!'
But I understand utmost disappointment when over-inflated expectations (all this hype and stupendous, favourable reviews) eventually met reality (the final product).
After reading some enthusiastic press reviews I was really looking forward to see this one; I did love to love this movie which meant to be really scary, with a proper horror mood and all. Alas, that is not the case! By the way - I would like to know the detailed diet of those comparing this one to The Exorcist!Back to the movie: one thing is sure - it is not another one cheap, asinine movie; I find production way above average; acting and directing is generally OK - but why Gabriel Byrne decided to star here remains a real mystery! I am not going to dwell upon some plot absurdities (a gruesome accident and no police involved/the drugged, the unconscious son driven home instead of being taken to hospital) because first of all others have already focused on them and secondly I think that so-called horror genre does not have to strictly follow a plain logical path and not everything need to be explained.But I do expect horror - as the movie claims to be - to give me at least occasional shivers. 
Hereditary starts as a drama and for the 3/4 of its running time it achieves this. If it went this way I'm sure it could have been a quite good drama... but then somebody realised: 'Hey, we're shooting a horror movie; let's use some blood and stuff!' The final half an hour seems to me to be rushed to say the least. And the final scene when the demon in the body of the son looks around there is no sign of its victory, it looks bewildered - as if it wants to ask: 'Hmmm... what a bunch of losers are all around me! What have I done?'",Hereditary

The director/writer is a true auteur and this movie will definitely be held on a pedestal for a long time. I will be lining up to see his next movie for sure.  If you are looking for jump scares and action, this might not be for you. If you enjoy an intense thrilling movie with lots to sink your teeth into and think about for a long time after, then check this movie out.

3321,mzurione,Deserves the acclaim.,10,24 August 2018,"Closer to the legendary horror films of the 60s and 70s than the modern jump-scare type flicks that are popular these days. Toni Collette is outstanding, as are all the actors, but the film's scope gives them the room to perform to their best. Interestingly, this is a film with very mixed reviews here. I guess that just goes to show why Hollywood is too afraid to experiment with anything new. I do think you need to have some life experience, and a little maturity to appreciate why some of the events are truly horrific. For example, if you think that something a character does is unrealistic, and there's a particular scene that a lot of people seen to feel this way about, then perhaps as you experience more of life you'll understand why they acted that way. That particular scene I am alluding to, I think I might have done exactly the same thing. Also, it is set up like a nightmare, so some things don't quite make sense. You don't really know what is real, what is part of mental illness, what is a dream. If you need your films to lay everything out in the broad daylight and not expect you to think, then you should probably avoid this. But, please don't avoid it. Go into it with an open mind, which is the advice given in the film. Don't see it as an accurate, truthful representation of real people, but a horror film at the nexus of reality, myth, and madness. I'm not bagging the shock horror jump scare type horror films, they have a place, but this is a different sort of horror film, and if you aren't used to that type of film it might take a little more effort on your part to really appreciate, but I thoroughly encourage you to make that effort.",Hereditary

3324,intothedarkme,"1 is perhaps too harsh, but 10 is unrealistic",6,25 August 2018,"Having seen headlines such as ""A modern day exorcist"" and a look into demons passed down from your parents, I was excited to see this movie and fully expecting to enjoy it. And I did at first.The beginning starts out strong with a look into a quirky family and a rather shocking event I was neither expecting or comfortable with (this is a good thing). The following 40 minutes after this event were tense and uncomfortable and the movie appeared to be going the route of a psychological horror/thriller. Unfortunately around the hour and a half mark, the train started wobbling and by the end had gone full blown off the rails, killing many, and leaving me thoroughly unamused and feeling like I'd been cheated of a real ending.This is where spoilers come in: stop reading if you intend on seeing the movie.Shortly after the little girl is decapitated by a power line pole we're shown the grief of the mother and the emotional weight the son carries as a result of the accident. This is quite possibly the best and most uncomfortable part and is littered with meltdowns and what seemed to be mild hallucinations which led me to believe this would be psychological. However, after this, things going the way of the witch in an head shaking manner (which I suppose in hindsight you could have seen coming from a mile away) with the mother meeting a suspiciously friendly medium who performs a seance for her and tells her she can do the same to talk to Charly. As one would expect things go eye rolling, face palmingly poorly and things start getting.... Paranormal (queue the X-files music).At this point the movie is losing it's identity and as a result I'm pulling back but I'd sunk an hour and a half in so far and enjoyed what I'd seen so I stuck through it and got the worst movie ending I'd seen this year. Right there next to Don't Breath, but unlike the ridiculous, cheesy ending of Don't Breath, this one didn't have any payoff, was rushed, and just generally silly. Some people said they laughed. I didn't find it funny personally, just a hugely insulting letdown to an otherwise goofy, but good movie. I guess the little girl was a demon from hell who needed to die so she could take over her brothers body and click another day while witches chant and beg for stuff.Verdict: Good movie overall but it seemed to lose it's identity partway through and devolved into absurdity, ultimately leading to a poor, rushed ending.",Hereditary

The last film that affected me similarly was Martyrs (2008), divisive in its reviews, but masterful in my opinion.

There were a lot of confusing, internal conflicts, conversations, lack of conversations, and imagery. It was like someone threw the plot of Paranormal Activity in with The Shining's psychological horror, added over suspense with 1980's synth with weird angles and Twilight awkward moments and called it a good horror movie.There were definitely some good parts and a lot disturbing and shocking scenes that worked out... like the pain and grief the mother went through. That was probably the most powerful scene in the entire movie. However, for example, the awkward pauses and lack of communication during the arguments were frustrating. The ending was frustrating. I had to resort to YouTube for an explanation... really?This could have been a great movie and gone down in history as a household name in the horror movie industry, but it was poorly executed.

Time to sit and watch a good horror with my husband is rare. What a waste of time this film was. The word horror needs removing from it description. I found it annoying in parts and obvious in others. My husband fell asleep but I felt compelled to watch it for the dramatic ending....don't bother there is no drama. First review ever as I felt so robbed. IMDB l have really started to question your rating system. Maybe more average person reviews rather than critics. Some people just want to watch a Damn good horror.,Hereditary

The other half though it plays out much like a drama. I would even suggest it's a better film when it's in drama mode than it is when it's in horror mode.The only plus point is so good acting as most of this film is a slow drawn out family drama.It started off strong and I was super hopeful. It dragged a bit through the middle, but the story seemed like it was going somewhere. The first hour and a half was okay and then BAM! a whole lotta wtf.I'm so sick and tired of ""artsy"" movies. Don't tell me I ""didn't get it."" I got it and it was stupid. If you want to love the movie, leave 15 minutes before it's over and just make up an ending in your mind.

I mean hey I'm not in a cult, I pray to God everyday, there's nothing to be afraid about Devil (especially when the movie executed badly, it left me a loud laugh). But this movie totally broke my religious mind. This movie brought me into its story, left a deep anxiety. This movie has a story where family, the one that gives you hug when in trouble, becomes your nightmare instead. So you can't escape to somebody else because you're confused where to go, and started thinking, can God really help me with this situation? I love it when a movie intimidates me in my seat. And the problem solving in some scenes seemed realistic for me. Even if it's bad, I can imagine myself doing the same thing. The only thing that is missing is in the third act. I think it could've been executed better. And the portion of the drama is a bit too much for me. I understand that this movie is a slow burn movie, but some parts of the drama were still unnecessary, and it could've been replaced by a more memorable scenes.

3366,sirdaz-29671,"An utter mess of a film, a waste of 2 hours. One of the worst films I've seen.",2,15 September 2018,"This film is neither well made nor scary.The story is a mish mash of cobbled together ideas, badly worn out tropes and utterly unrelated things.By the 50 minute mark I found myself messaging people to ask if they had seen it and that I was bored, but by then I felt it must get better. It never does.I really do not understand the rave reviews, all I can assume is that they are from people who have never seen a real horror movie ever.The 'plot' revolves around an elderly lady dying, her daughter who for some unknown reason makes miniatures (and the film tries to make out these are important, but they aren't), her 2 children and husband. There is basically no sensible dialogue throughout.For some contrived reason the mother forces her 16 year old son (who looks 30) into taking the 12 year old daughter to a party. Where she ends up predictably coming into contact with nuts (the film rams the fact that the daughter has a nut allergy right at you a few scenes prior). This leads to the only good scene in the entire movie, which does make you gasp / cringe.After that nothing really makes any sense, and it all becomes very predictable (a seance, really... never saw that coming ...) which then leads to some odd 'demon' / 'god' thing taking over the mother, who then manages to be able to stick to the ceiling in a most unconvincing manner, as well as to be able to 'swim' across the scene... I think this is supposed to be scary, it's just laughable.The husband (Gabrielle Byrne) mostly looks like someone who cannot believe he is saying the things he is, or being told the things he is, and looks to be lamenting his career for most of the movie (then you realise he and Toni Collette actually backed it themselves, which explains how they got the lead roles), bursts into 1980s style flames...which do not even mark the immaculate wooden flooring.Then it ends, with totally unaccountable old age pensioner nudity, which bares no relation to anything that you've been watching.Toni Collette gives things a good go, but the dialogue is just crazy. Aunt Lydia from Handmaid's Tale turns up and leads the charge of the bleedin' obvious through the last portion.All in all, if you like horror, good films, good stories, good acting, good effects then avoid this garbage.My partner and I are still in shock that we stuck with it through to the end, neither can believe just how bad it was.",Hereditary

Eerie, understated and atmospheric, yet not afraid to really torture its characters in ways that seem both cruel, inevitable, and almost tragic. For me, the relationship between the family was drenched in more horror elements that really stuck compared to the supernatural elements. Despite this, the film combined both elements to a shockingly effective degree, never letting the tension loosen. It terrorizes the concept of an innate hatred that can stew between family members and the never-ending resentments that build with it. The ending alone is fantastic, but the slow-brew of a film does a fine job keeping you both guessing, worried and entrenched in a horrific little story. Amazing acting from a tight ensemble case that redefines Annie as the ultimate movie final girl / monster. Def recommend",Hereditary

What does Annie pull out of her mouth at Joann's house while drinking tea?
Everything else I figured out. Charlie is Paimon from birth and grandma was a wet nurse ( gross) to nurture Paimon.. at 11 minutes into the movie Annie picks up a book with a short letter from Grandma writin to Annie that basically tells Annie that thier SACRIFICE is worth it because the end result is greater than she could hope for,,
All of the naked people at the end of the movie are in most of the scenes throughout the movie,,the smiling guy at the funeral is downstairs of the house where the dad gets burned up, one of Peter's teachers is also in the attic next to the waving lady that also wavied at Charlie when Charlie cut the birds head off,,and Joann and some of the other cult members are in the group meetings..
If you look closely at the scene where Charlie See's her dead grandma around the fire there are some heavy footprints on the trail that Charlie is walking on,,

If you're going in expecting something like the conjuring chocked full of cheap jump scares, you are definitely watching the wrong film.I feel this movie probably isn't meant to be seen in theatres. Instead, try watching it in a dark room on a good tv with a good sound system (if possible) either by yourself or with a few friends. I honestly feel that this is one of the best supernatural films to come out in a long time. Although some may argue it's a bit contrived, it still feels fresh and is very well executed, and it DECIMATES the other recycled new age paranormal filth that's been shoved down our throats for so long (The Conjuring, The Nun, Annabelle, Insidious).

A breath of fresh air to the satanic cult genre of horror movie and it works perfectly. The slow pace and build up pays off by the end. Cinematography is on point for this one, too. It helps to create an immense sense of dread which lingers throughout the entire movie. The one stand out feature for this one however, the acting, especially Toni Collette. I couldn't have asked for a better performance and she is definately oscar worthy. Overall, just watch the movie.

I had to read afterwards to discover plot points that I somehow missed even though I was glued to the screen the whole time because the scenes are visually so great. It is such a slow movie, which I like a lot of times, but this one is painful. Plus, the little girl was the best part of the movie and then she dies halfway through. A huge bummer.I even liked the first two-thirds of the movie, but then it lost me with the seance. That's where Toni Collette, who I loved in Little Miss Sunshine, begins overacting and it's terrible. Queue the confusing plot points. She finds a headless corpse in the attic, which is super creepy and a great plot twist, but she assumes it's her dead mother. I thought the little girl was the one that was decapitated and I kept hoping she would come back somehow, but I was left wanting. Then she begs her husband at least 20 times to throw a book in the fire. It's like they were trying to make it funny through sheer repetition. The husband walks up to the fire and inexplicably decides not to do it. I do not understand his character it needs more background or something. Then she chucks it in the fire and, again inexplicably, he spontaneously combusts. I thought she was the one that was supposed to catch fire. Then off-screen I guess Collette gets possessed by someone or something because she traps her son in the attic, but it's never explained who is controller her. Then she saws off her own head, also super creepy, but I have no idea why the controlling spirit does this.I think I would have liked it if the first part of the movie had been scarier with a little more explaining. I also think I would have liked it if the last part of the movie was not scary and just a conflict-resolution drama of a grieving family. The first part of the film was a great setup for this. But the film didn't do either. I need to rate it 1/10 to offset all the glowing reviews. And nobody in my family liked this one.",Hereditary
